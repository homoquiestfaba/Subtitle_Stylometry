1
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,810
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,570
We're in Moscow in the Soviet Union.

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:34,618
This promises to be the most watched
event in boxing history.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,002
I must break you.

5
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,426
- Throw your right!
- He won't let him out of there.

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,595
Rocky!

7
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,724
Rocky Balboa is in serious trouble.

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,893
He's gettin' killed out there.

9
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,524
Drago continuing
to punish Rocky Balboa.

10
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,445
- No pain.
- No pain.

11
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,741
Rocky's been hit with bombs.

12
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,118
Rocky's hurt.

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,583
A right hand from Drago sends
Rocky Balboa 15 feet across the ring.

14
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,004
Come on. Get up!

15
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,843
It's been a one-sided fight so far.

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,972
And Drago throws a hard right hand
that stuns Rocky Balboa.

17
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:43,270
They might have to stop this one
before somebody gets killed.

18
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,737
Rocky taking punishment.
He is completely exhausted.

19
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:07,503
And Balboa goes down again
from a right hand.

20
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,012
Punch after punch. Amazing willpower!

21
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,562
Rocky Balboa has taken
Ivan Drago's best punches so far.

22
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,648
He's cut and he's bleeding.

23
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,276
- All right, what's happenin' out there?
- I see three of 'em.

24
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,155
- Hit the one in the middle.
- Right! Hit the one in the middle.

25
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,951
- The Russian's cut.
- Hit him!

26
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,887
To the ground like a wrestler. It's a
gutter war. No holds barred in Moscow.

27
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,391
All your strength.
All your power!. Everything you've got!

28
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,768
Now, this is your whole life here!

29
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,604
And a big right hand by Rocky Balboa.

30
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,863
Rocky Balboa has done the impossible.

31
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,725
Oh, man, I never saw nothing like it.
Came through like the champ you are.

32
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,186
Did yourself and everybody proud.

33
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,563
Especially Apollo!

34
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,150
- Yo, Tony.
- Yeah, what is it? What do you need?

35
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:55,319
Get Adrian.

36
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,752
How's everybody doin' out there?

37
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,505
Everything's OK.

38
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,008
What's wrong?

39
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:24,932
- What's wrong?
- Remember when Mick said

40
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,809
when he was fighting sometimes,

41
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:34,066
he'd fight so hard that he was thinking
that he broke something inside?

42
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,985
He was gonna die?

43
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:43,200
And that's what he said, that's when
the angels was pulling on him.

44
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,745
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't know what's wrong.

45
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,581
- I can't...
- Can't what?

46
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:55,420
I can't stop my hands from shaking.

47
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,927
- I ain't never felt this thing.
- You better see a doctor.

48
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,888
No. I just wanna go home.

49
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,057
No. You can see a doctor.

50
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,685
I'm just tired.

51
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,354
I just wanna go home, Mick.

52
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,983
- I'm just tired. I just...
- OK.

53
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,652
- I just wanna go home, OK?
- OK.

54
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,760
- Adrian, where's the kid?
- I don't know.

55
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,724
I don't see the kid.
Where's the kid? Ain't he here?

56
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,852
- Dad!
- There he is!

57
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,980
Hey, slugger! How you doin'?

58
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,982
- Say hi to your mom.
- Hi, Mom.

59
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,318
- I'm forgotten now?
- Hi, Uncle Paulie.

60
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,362
- Dad, how do you feel?
- A few new dents. How's school?

61
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,156
I made the honour roll.

62
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:08,702
Hi. Airport Security. Welcome home.
There's a press reception inside.

63
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,081
Rocky, how did you feel
about the Russian people?

64
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,792
You know, very good.
They was great people.

65
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,464
I didn't understand what they said
all the time, but I knew what they meant.

66
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,841
Mrs Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

67
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,887
- Did I learn Russian?
- Yeah, she got fluent in vodka.

68
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,183
Rocky, there are rumours
of physical complications.

69
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,561
- Complications?
- No, those were rumours.

70
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,689
He's in perfect physical condition.

71
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:44,613
Rocky, the American Medical Association
has recommended that boxing be banned.

72
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,990
- Yeah.
- Do you agree with the doctors?

73
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,078
Yeah, absolutely.
I think that doctors should never fight.

74
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,831
That was a beautiful answer, champ.

75
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:58,752
Doctors should stay out of the ring.
Doctors should never fight.

76
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,713
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever.

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,550
America's own Rocky Balboa!
How are ya?

78
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,594
George Washington Duke,
promoter extraordinaire,

79
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:12,891
welcomes Rocky Balboa, champion
of all the Americas and all of the Russias.

80
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,811
I would like to digress
from the questions a bit

81
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,230
and pose a proposition to the media.

82
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,860
Everyone in this city and in the
world of sports knows my reputation

83
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:27,447
for promoting some of the finest
extravaganzas in this country.

84
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,953
Well now, with the press present,
I'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa,

85
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,624
to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be.

86
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,170
Give this man, Union Cane,
a chance to challenge you

87
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,505
for the heavyweight championship.

88
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,342
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

89
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,513
Isn't it bad timing to challenge, Duke?
The man just got off the plane.

90
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,641
Timing is the essence of life,
gentlemen and ladies.

91
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,437
Now what I have on this paper
is the largest guarantee

92
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:01,565
ever offered to a champion on this planet.

93
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:06,862
I'm talking about a fantastic international
extravaganza, to be held in Japan,

94
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,032
called Lettin' It Go in Tokyo.

95
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,871
It's incredible. Only in America do people
like us rise from oppression and poverty

96
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:19,082
to join hands in this international event.

97
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,503
- Excuse me.
- Only in America!

98
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,547
Excuse me. My husband is retired.

99
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,217
He has nothing more to prove.

100
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,427
Wait a minute! Hey, Rocky...

101
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:35,390
Don't you consider this a public
responsibility to respond now?

102
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,894
- Respond to the people.
- Isn't this about professionalism?

103
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,773
- To talk about it now, not later.
- Do you mind if I heal first?

104
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,985
- You got nothin' like what I got for you.
- What the hell does this all mean?

105
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,323
- That isn't enough. We gotta know now.
- Gotta think about that. So anyway,

106
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,827
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was really nice.

107
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,249
- Come on, guys. We need more.
- Adrian, if you weren't with me,

108
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,794
I never woulda done as good.
You're always there.

109
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:08,966
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

110
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,468
Come on. Are you gonna retire or not?

111
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:16,181
- Anyway, excuse me. I'd like to go home.
- Give us something to write.

112
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:20,352
- Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
- No!

113
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,441
Don't worry. We'll get him.

114
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,382
No, really. It's great.

115
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:59,099
Look at this place! I swear I ain't never
leavin' this place again, you know that?

116
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,854
Hey, would you like to dance? How about
a homecoming dance for your old man?

117
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,399
- No, don't be silly. It's cold.
- I'll warm you up, young lady.

118
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,777
Have a dance. Hurry up.
The music's almost over.

119
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,698
- Do you like the song?
- You should rest.

120
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,950
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm tired. Come on.

121
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,829
Maybe I'll take you upstairs and
violate you like a parkin' meter.

122
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,665
- Cost you a quarter.
- Yo, Adrian!

123
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,668
Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?

124
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,883
Uncle Paulie,
you notice something strange about Dad?

125
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,302
He just took a few hard shots.

126
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,764
I think you tell
better jokes than me, Adrian.

127
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:46,855
Did I hear somebody
call for their old man? Did you do this?

128
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,732
Sleep time, kid, OK?

129
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,444
Dad, did you know your bones
grow three times as fast at night?

130
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,073
No, I didn't, but I heard
somethin' like that. Is that me?

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,325
- Oh yeah, that's you.
- Excellent!

132
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,578
- Is that me? When we was fishin', right?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,039
That's beautiful! Look at the tent.

134
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,459
You know,
the fish was a lot bigger, if I recall.

135
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,838
Actually, that was a lot smaller.

136
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,467
Anyway, come on. Hit the bed.
It's time for you to get healthy.

137
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,720
This is great.
I don't know where you learned this.

138
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,599
It is something how this thing
comes out of your fingers and...

139
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,768
Oh my God.

140
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,567
Who's this?

141
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,696
It's Madame Dupont, my French teacher.

142
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,365
Really?

143
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,703
Yeah. She looks French, sure.

144
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,000
I wouldn't show this to your mother, cos
she don't understand French too good.

145
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,961
God. Better cover that one up.

146
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,589
Well, champ, it's bedtime.

147
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,592
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

148
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,844
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

149
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,346
- Madame.
- Madame who?

150
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,474
- Ma damn foot's caught in the door!
- That's an old joke.

151
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,227
What do you want from me? I'm trying.

152
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,355
I don't know all the good things,
you know?

153
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,108
- What's this?
- What?

154
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:18,363
Look what I found in your ear.
Russian money. Money ears!

155
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,867
All right. Anyway, listen.
You gotta get some sleep.

156
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:26,580
Dad? Today, when you said
having me was like being born again...

157
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,249
- Yeah?
- What did you mean?

158
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,336
Well, you know, you come up like I did

159
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:38,675
and you got, like, three square meals
of zero a day, know what I mean?

160
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,094
You got the A-side of life and the B-side.

161
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,932
I'm on the B-side, but you...
you got all the breaks.

162
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,394
So when I see you having
all these things that I didn't have,

163
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,523
I, like, live through your eyes.

164
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:57,236
I enjoy it a little bit.
It's like having it all over again.

165
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,446
That's nice.

166
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,742
Hey, look in my face.
Do I look like a raccoon?

167
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,703
- A little bit.
- Like Rocky Raccoon?

168
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,497
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Nah!

169
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,541
- Yeah, you do a little.
- Really?

170
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:15,420
Hey, if you think I look bad,
you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.

171
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,132
Anyway, yo. Good night.

172
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,301
- OK, kid?
- Night.

173
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,638
- Dad?
- Yo?

174
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,434
- Glad you're home.
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

175
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:34,189
We'll play tomorrow, OK? Maybe
you can show me your English teacher.

176
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,859
- She's pretty hot, too.
- Nah!

177
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,111
Good night, kid.

178
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,572
You deserve the worst for what you did.

179
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,700
- That was Rocky's money.
- You wanna be hysterical?

180
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,703
- You cost us everything.
- It was a mistake.

181
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,455
You think I thought
this was gonna happen?

182
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:55,377
Don't you walk away from me.
You just gave up our life!

183
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,796
And you think it's some stupid thing?

184
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:01,967
Paulie, do you know what you did?
Do you know how serious it is?

185
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:06,680
I understand it!
I understand the whole freakin' thing!

186
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,184
I understand it.
Your accountant's a crook, not me!

187
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,187
I did what I thought was right.
Don't blame me.

188
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,772
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody.

189
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,941
Adrian, what's wrong?

190
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,777
Look what you done now.
She's dumpin' it all on me.

191
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,864
- Come on, don't turn this around on me.
- What did you do?

192
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,492
He gave power of attorney
to our accountant.

193
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,371
I just didn't gave anything to nobody.

194
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,000
He sent a letter. He says
"We'll be in Russia a couple of months

195
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,628
and I need Rocky to sign a tax extension".

196
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,465
That extension was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

197
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,593
He's the thief! I need alcohol.

198
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,472
Rocky, on my eyes,
I never stole a freakin' dime.

199
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,225
Adrian, what's happenin' here?

200
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

201
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,689
The money. The money.
Everything. It's all gone.

202
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,277
The piece of paper Paulie had you sign
wasn't a request for a tax extension.

203
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,448
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favour of the accountant,

204
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,451
who was involved in
some high-priced real estate.

205
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,747
He thought he could have your money
back before you knew it was gone.

206
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,708
Unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room,

207
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,129
his deals fell through because the
market dried up. And you lost millions.

208
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:25,509
- Ain't there nothin' I can do?
- I've filed eight criminal acts against him.

209
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:28,428
But you've got debt payment
on this property,

210
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,933
he didn't pay your tax returns and your
mortgage hasn't been paid in months.

211
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,478
We didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

212
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:41,775
- Don't take it from me. Ask him.
- There's nearly $400,000 outstanding.

213
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:45,696
The only thing that is not encumbered
is a gym, willed to your son

214
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,866
by a Mickey Goldmill in 1982.

215
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,161
You can sell things.
Remember those commercials you did?

216
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,873
I ain't no commercial kinda guy.
I'm a fighter. That's what I do.

217
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,335
No, we couldn't get sponsors.
With the investigation of the accountant,

218
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:04,173
out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault.

219
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,800
But that was a long time ago.
He didn't know...

220
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:11,180
Why not a couple more fights? With
your popularity, you'd be out in no time.

221
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,932
- He's retiring.
- Rocko, fighting's the ticket.

222
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,728
I said he's retired!
Paulie, we're here because of you.

223
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:22,357
I'm not taking the heat for all this.
I thought I was doing smart business.

224
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:27,988
- You thought you did smart business?
- Hey! The accountant was your choice.

225
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:33,076
You shoulda known he was a thief, but in
your fairy-tale world the air don't move.

226
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,996
- You're like a season that don't change.
- Hey, enough.

227
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,166
I'm not no tomato can you kick around.

228
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,545
You call Duke. Tell him I'll fight Cane.
I don't care. Anywhere, any time.

229
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,132
- No. Rocky, no!
- If that's what you want, I'll get on it.

230
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,677
- Rocky, please.
- A couple of fights, we're outta trouble.

231
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,597
- Yeah, but you said...
- No, I didn't say anything.

232
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:56,850
- Did we come this far to lose it?
- You have to see a doctor.

233
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:02,147
- I don't need a doctor. I need a promoter.
- If the doctor says OK, I'll support you.

234
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,776
I gotta fight, OK?
I got problems. I gotta fight.

235
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,945
Will you do it for me?

236
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,532
All right. For you.

237
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,244
Because of continuous
violent blows to the head,

238
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,998
you have a condition particular to boxers
called cavum septum pellucidum,

239
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,418
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

240
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,381
The brain surface neurons in this area
have also been traumatised.

241
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:33,136
Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means that
you have suffered damage to the brain.

242
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,305
How long until he recovers?

243
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,683
The effects are irreversible.

244
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,937
Rocky, you have to retire.

245
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:47,484
I don't wanna retire. This ain't the time
to retire. Not in here, not in no office.

246
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:53,490
I just fought the best fight of my life.
I just did that, you know?

247
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:58,579
- And all I need is a couple more.
- No. You suffered severe brain trauma.

248
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,415
He could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

249
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,001
He ain't God.
Adrian, only God ain't wrong.

250
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:07,963
- Rocky, this is what's good for you.
- I only need a couple of easy ones.

251
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,926
Not the way it is. You can't get licensed
in any State. He can't, can he, Doctor?

252
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,930
- That is correct.
- Rocky, do you love me?

253
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:24,062
- Yeah, I love you. Why do you ask that?
- Because if you love somebody,

254
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,317
you live with them, you live for them.
You don't gamble with a life.

255
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,279
Rocky, I don't care
about the money. It's you.

256
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,448
That's all that matters.

257
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,037
Please. We'll be OK. We'll be fine.

258
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:55,552
- No one has to know, Doctor, right?
- It'll be strictly confidential.

259
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,266
Thank you.

260
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,080
May we hear our next bid, please?

261
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,457
Are you done?

262
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:27,835
Sold.

263
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,215
Moving along, ladies and gentlemen.
Item number 46...

264
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,260
Hey, kid. Bike's been sold.

265
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,513
Hey, bike's been sold.
Get off the bike. Come on.

266
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:51,024
Don't worry about it.
We been down before.

267
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:55,988
I'll get it all back. We just gotta
stick together, hey? Home team.

268
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,948
Yeah, right.

269
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:03,453
Come on. You know, Mickey used to say
a fight ain't over till you heard the bell.

270
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,622
We ain't heard a bell yet, have we?

271
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:09,251
Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves
from his first fight...

272
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,396
Rocky?

273
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,316
Hey, it still fits.

274
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,154
Why are you wearin' those clothes?

275
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,409
I was just going through some stuff and I
found them. They feel kinda comfortable.

276
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:46,663
I was looking all over for you downstairs.
It's kind of depressing.

277
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,917
Yeah, I know what you mean.

278
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,711
What's this doin' in your ear?

279
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,049
- Oh, God!
- Remember these?

280
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,926
Yeah.

281
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:05,641
- I remember when you took 'em off.
- That's right. First time I ever kissed you.

282
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:13,649
Adrian, I wanna go out for a bit.
You know, just take a little walk.

283
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,319
I just wanna feel better.
But hey, could you talk to the kid?

284
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,073
- Cos he's really taking this hard.
- Sure.

285
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:27,120
- Where are you going?
- I thought I'd go to Andy's.

286
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:41,260
- He used to be a champion.
- How did he blow it all?

287
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,584
How you doing, Mick?

288
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,864
Slip the jab.

289
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,747
Slip the jab!

290
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,835
That's right. That's it.

291
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,003
- Hey, I didn't hear no bell!
- OK.

292
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:45,050
All right! That's right. Slip the jab.

293
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:49,054
That's it. Mentalise!
See that bum in front of you.

294
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:53,225
You see yourself doing right,
and you do right.

295
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,936
That's pretty. That's very pretty.

296
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,021
Time!

297
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,191
Come here, Rock.
My God, you're ready, ain't ya?

298
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:05,529
Apollo won't know what hit him.
You'll roll over him like a bulldozer.

299
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,698
An Italian bulldozer.

300
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:11,869
You know, kid, I know how you feel
about this fight that's comin' up.

301
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,371
Because I was young once, too.

302
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,125
I tell you somethin'.

303
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,711
Why, if you wasn't here,

304
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:24,173
I probably wouldn't be alive today.

305
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:29,052
The fact that you're here and doing
as well as you're doing gives me...

306
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:33,599
What do you call it?
A motivisation to stay alive.

307
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:38,228
Cos I think that people die sometimes
when they don't wanna live no more.

308
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,480
Nature's smarter than people think.

309
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:45,068
And nature is smarter than people think.
Little by little we lose our friends,

310
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:50,115
we lose everything and we keep
losing and losing, till we say:

311
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:54,828
"What the hell am I living around
here for? I got no reason to go on".

312
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:58,373
But with you, kid...

313
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,834
Boy, I got a reason to go on.

314
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:05,589
And I'm gonna stay alive.
And I will watch you make good.

315
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:10,177
- And I'll never leave you.
- I'll never leave you until that happens.

316
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:15,098
Cos when I leave you,
you'll not only know how to fight,

317
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,436
you'll be able to take care of yourself
outside the ring, too. Is that OK?

318
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:22,272
- It's OK.
- OK.

319
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,442
- I got a gift for you.
- Ah, Mickey.

320
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,820
- Wait a minute now.
- Really, I don't need nothin'.

321
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:35,619
Look at that. See that? This here's the
favourite thing that I have on this earth.

322
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,997
And Rocky Marciano give me that.

323
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,959
You know what it was? His cuff link.

324
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,171
And now I'm giving it to you.

325
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,341
And it's gonna be like...

326
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:53,136
Like an angel on your shoulder to you.

327
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:58,684
And if you ever get hurt and
you feel that you're goin' down,

328
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,895
this little angel
is gonna whisper in your ear.

329
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:05,524
He's gonna say
"Get up, you son of a bitch!"

330
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,570
"Cos Mickey loves you".

331
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,155
OK?

332
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,200
Thanks, Mick. I love you, too.

333
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,870
Jesus. Go after him, kid.

334
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,456
- Go after him.
- Thanks.

335
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,338
You was the angel.

336
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,550
- There it is.
- What happened to his other cuff link?

337
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,428
I don't know. He only give me one.

338
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,805
He gave it to some bum.

339
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:28,482
Careful. Don't worry about these.

340
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,901
All right, let's go, Paulie.

341
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:34,905
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

342
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:39,409
Hey, Rock, it's good I kept
the place, right? It saves money.

343
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:40,953
Get back.

344
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,499
Right? A little aluminum
on the front too. It's a winner!

345
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,505
Thank you.

346
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,384
Welcome back, Rocky. We missed ya!

347
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,680
It's only temporary, you know?

348
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,849
Come on inside.

349
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,152
- Hello?
- Mrs Balboa?

350
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,322
- George Washington Duke here.
- Yes?

351
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:22,327
Mrs Balboa, can you hear it?
Listen close. You must be able to hear it.

352
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,038
- Hear what?
- The sound of the parade going by,

353
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,207
of opportunity knocking.

354
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,418
What'll take to get you to realize

355
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:32,921
I'm givin' you a chance
to pull yourselves together?

356
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:38,635
Let me handle your husband's career
and you can live like human beings again.

357
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:44,057
Listen, Mr Duke, we're living like human
beings. You oughta try it some time.

358
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,560
And leave my husband alone.

359
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,857
Women!

360
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,407
When'd you start that?

361
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:04,328
I don't know. It's like a bad habit
that comes back. But, hey!

362
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:07,539
We ain't talkin' about me.
We're talkin' about you.

363
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:09,708
Hey, Rocky, how you doin', man?

364
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:12,419
- Good to see you back.
- Thanks. Great to be back.

365
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:16,340
You're smart in school,
but you gotta be smart on the street, too.

366
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,343
- How do you mean?
- You gotta know who the players are

367
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,889
- and who you're talkin' to.
- Watch out for scams. Everyone scams.

368
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,350
- What's a scam?
- Ask your father.

369
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:29,603
- A scam is like a hustle.
- He don't get it.

370
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,523
- Well, a hustle's related to...
- Rocky!

371
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,108
- Remember me? I'm Bubba's mother.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:39,363
- You used his head for a punchin' bag.
- Yeah, he had a nice head.

373
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:44,117
- Anyway, a hustle's related to a con.
- He don't get it.

374
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,538
A deception?
You're saying beware of deceptions.

375
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:51,708
Yeah, that's good. Absolutely.
You're very smart, you know?

376
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:55,963
Ain't this where
the Atomic Hoagy shop used to be?

377
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:58,006
I'm new here, Dad.

378
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:02,386
- This neighbourhood's got tooth decay.
- It's called urban blight.

379
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:07,015
I'll tell you somethin',
this place is blightin' everywhere.

380
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:11,562
A little aluminum siding and paint, this
place could be OK. What do you think?

381
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:17,276
Anyway, we're late for school.
Paulie, I wanna talk to the kid private like.

382
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,444
- Like I got no feelings.
- Oh, come on.

383
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,447
- That's how wars start.
- Relax, would you?

384
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:26,660
- So anyway, everybody's got an angle.
- Tough break, Rock.

385
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:32,207
Everybody's got a hustle. These kids have
got street brains. That's how they live.

386
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:37,004
These kids ain't like no personalities
that you've grown up with.

387
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,799
- So you gotta stay very sharp round here.
- I intend to.

388
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:45,679
Intend! You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

389
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:49,349
- Why?
- Why? Cos you're smarter than me.

390
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:50,976
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

391
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:55,105
It's like every day you learn somethin'
new and I forget somethin' new.

392
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:58,066
But hey, listen.
We're in this thing together.

393
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:01,987
If you can figure out how to fix
things up, don't be afraid to tell me.

394
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:05,115
We gotta stick together, cos what are we?

395
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:07,701
- What?
- What are we?

396
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:12,039
- Oh, home team.
- Home team! You've got that right.

397
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:18,086
I used to go to this school when I was
a kid. Nice bricks. It was real tough then.

398
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:21,548
But I think you can handle it,
don't you think?

399
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,970
If you went here, I can go here.

400
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,556
I'm not scared really.

401
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,600
Really?

402
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,144
Well, I guess I'm a little scared.

403
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,814
- But that's normal, don't you think?
- Oh, yeah. I had 72 fights...

404
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:43,320
..and every one of 'em I was scared, so
yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.

405
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,701
- I'll see you later.
- OK, kid. Here's the front door.

406
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,914
Hey, wait. What's this?

407
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,918
Goodness gracious.
Where'd this come from?

408
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,380
It's a strange place to stash
your lunch money.

409
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:03,465
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

410
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:07,344
- Thanks, Dad.
- OK, then, I'll see you later.

411
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:11,014
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one. Home team.

412
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,600
Just be nice, right? You'll be OK.

413
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,690
And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
They don't like that around here.

414
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,073
You know, I'm really
worried about the kid.

415
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,660
He ain't used to livin' like this.
He don't know the streets.

416
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,163
At school, I know what's gonna happen.

417
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:39,334
Some wise guy's gonna come up to him
cos he's my kid and try to bang him out.

418
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,421
Give him a cheap shot, you know?
I mean, jeez...

419
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:46,300
- Mr Balboa, my name's Tommy Gunn.
- Yeah? How you doin'?

420
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,635
With that name, you better be tough.

421
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:53,432
It ain't easy. Anyway, I'm from Oklahoma.
My amateur record is 45 to one.

422
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,394
- I turned pro at 18 and I had eight fights.
- You're a fighter?

423
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,689
And now that I'm 20,
I'd just like to show you what I got.

424
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:04,651
- I've saved up about 400 bucks...
- Mr Rocky Balboa!

425
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:09,281
Excuse me, I have some business here.
Good to see you again, friend.

426
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:12,743
- How you doin'?
- My health is fine. What more can I ask?

427
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,538
- Listen, I gotta go to work now.
- What, here? In a sweatbox?

428
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:20,042
- Can't be good for the image.
- Urban light. What can you do?

429
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,878
What'd you say? It's blight. Urban blight.

430
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:27,299
George wants you to consider wearing
gloves again. It's a helluva payday.

431
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:30,219
- I'm officially expired.
- You have marquee value.

432
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:36,099
You put asses into seats. A businessman
don't retire if he can still pull in the bread.

433
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:40,646
- Only America gives these opportunities.
- Union Cane's going for the title.

434
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,982
Here's some tickets.
We've a strong feeling about this.

435
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:48,237
- If he takes it, that's the time to challenge.
- People love comebacks.

436
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:51,907
There's nothing more commercial
than a long-shot comeback

437
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:54,409
of a down-on-his-luck underdog.

438
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:58,705
As Mark Twain said: "Virtue has
never been as respectable as money".

439
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,499
- Who's Twain?
- A painter.

440
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,751
You're the Great White Hope.

441
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,712
You mean Great White Dope. No, forget it.

442
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:10,175
Hold the bullshit. I know the problem.
You think I was born yesterday?

443
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:15,514
Merlin, show him the paper. This is your
medical report. We can work around it.

444
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,975
- Where'd you get this?
- It doesn't matter.

445
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:21,478
If you fight Cane, George can
guarantee to get you a license.

446
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,272
- Guaranteed.
- You can do this?

447
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:26,108
- No problem.
- This comeback's in the bag.

448
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:30,571
- The time's hot. The deal's hot. Caliente!
- We could use one more payday.

449
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:35,325
- Adrian, where'd you come from?
- Mrs Balboa just appeared! She's magic.

450
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:39,037
I don't think you're funny.
Are you talking him into fighting?

451
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,624
Talking business, darlin'.
Do you like feelin' hard up?

452
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:47,296
Do you like reachin' in your pocket
and only feelin' your leg? I didn't think so.

453
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,841
I'm offering you the opportunity
to dump this loser image.

454
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:54,219
- Who are you talking to?
- You ain't workin' across...

455
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:58,473
What the hell are you talkin' about?
This is a tremendous opportunity.

456
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,519
Opportunity for who? For you to
make money? For him to be disabled?

457
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,439
What would you do
if the choices were reversed?

458
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,649
You have to think about that.

459
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,611
Rocky, they don't care about you.

460
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:15,240
Let's get serious. You represent
the dreams of the long shots.

461
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:19,870
The little people identify with you.
That is the key to public success.

462
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:24,666
You a true champion, a true product of
the people. Sell it while they'll still buy.

463
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:28,712
That ain't gonna last forever.
You say you a fighter, then fight!

464
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:33,258
And I'll make you so much money you
can swim in it. You can swim, can't you?

465
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,720
Whaddaya say?
Put some hustle behind this muscle.

466
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,556
He's done. He's done fighting!

467
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:49,024
You are a damn fool.

468
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,654
Maybe we oughta sign
Mrs Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

469
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:57,825
Looks like she's the one
with the cojones in the family.

470
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,995
You don't talk like that in front of my wife.

471
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,665
That ain't no park bench, boy.

472
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:12,756
- I'll get him.
- Rocky, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna...

473
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,509
You guys want privacy? I'll be upstairs.

474
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,890
Rocky.

475
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,226
Rocky, I'm sorry. I...

476
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:27,729
But it just takes one bad hit
and you could be an invalid.

477
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:32,734
I feel like an invalid already. Why'd you
come back? You're too smart for this.

478
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:36,280
I got nothing to do. I called Gloria.

479
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:40,617
- She said she could use part-time help.
- But why do you wanna do this?

480
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:44,788
Why go back to where you started?
I gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!

481
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:48,417
I wanted to be there
so I could be close to you.

482
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,929
All right, yeah.
You know, it's gettin' cold out here.

483
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:04,349
Maybe we better get inside, OK?
I understand.

484
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,310
- Are you all right?
- What?

485
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,188
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine.

486
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,565
Adrian, it's gettin' cold, OK?

487
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:21,116
Yo, Adrian! Did we ever leave this place?

488
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,954
I don't know.

489
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,837
Hey, mind if I talk to you now?

490
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:36,673
My head's a little busy right now.

491
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,812
You won't get him.
Balboa don't think straight.

492
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,025
- None of these bums do. I need an angle.
- I'll fight Balboa right now.

493
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,529
- I'm better than Balboa ever was.
- Hey!

494
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,533
I own the paper on you.
You will fight who I tell you,

495
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:06,078
where I tell you and how I tell you.
You got that?

496
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:10,207
Don't aggravate
the hand that feeds you, huh?

497
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:16,296
None of these bums think straight.

498
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,802
All I need is a hook.

499
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,149
Hey! Ain't you Rocky's kid?

500
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:39,570
- Yeah! You Rocky's kid, right?
- Yeah. How're you doing?

501
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,780
I've seen your picture in the paper.

502
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:45,242
- You know what? Your old man's a punk.
- What?

503
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:49,454
- Get off me!
- What are you wearing my coat for?

504
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:52,166
- Just leave him alone!
- You wanna beatin' too?

505
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,586
- Gimme my coat! I'm not kiddin' around.
- No way.

506
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,179
Don't get sick now!

507
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,682
Hope you don't catch cold, rich boy.

508
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:14,563
Keep it high. Slip and slide. That's it.

509
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,192
This is the cup Rocky drinks out of
around the house. Ten bucks.

510
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,778
- How I know it's the real thing?
- Look at the lip marks.

511
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,990
- All right. Five bucks. No more.
- You got a deal.

512
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,243
- Excuse me.
- Tommy Gunn!

513
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,246
- Is there some place I can change?
- In there.

514
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,249
Time! Hey, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

515
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,960
If you wanna survive,
you gotta slip the jab.

516
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:41,256
Keep it high and hit and not get hit,
you know? OK, take off.

517
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,218
- Rocko, remember Tommy Gunn?
- Oh, yeah.

518
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,887
He says he wants to fight.
I tell him to get married.

519
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,680
Why?

520
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:51,141
That's gym humour, Rocko.

521
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:55,604
Let's see what you got there, kid.

522
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,564
Get married. I understand.

523
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,567
- Benson! Wanna move a little?
- Yeah, all right.

524
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,905
Hey, Paulie, what's the cojones?

525
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,910
Cojones is Latin for Spanish nuts.

526
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:12,913
- Yo, Rock, we're ready.
- Wonderful.

527
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:17,251
Hey, kid. You got the headgear?

528
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,419
Nah, I don't need one.

529
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:23,674
He's gonna get his cojones knocked out.

530
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,551
OK. Ready, guys?

531
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:29,054
- Benson, go easy, all right?
- Sure. OK, Rocky.

532
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,348
Time!

533
00:40:31,515 --> 00:40:34,935
All right, just go easy now.
Slip the jab now.

534
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:40,482
- Hey, kid! What's his name again?
- Tommy Gunn.

535
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,569
Tommy, whoa! It ain't no law to duck.

536
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,822
Go side to side. That's it.

537
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:55,122
- Hey, man, take it easy.
- Come on, lighten up. It's called sparring.

538
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,458
Hey! OK. Hey, kid.

539
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,878
Hey, lighten up! Time out!

540
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,964
Smell that, Rocko?
The odour of opportunity.

541
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,884
Hey, that's it.
What did I tell you? Time!

542
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,094
Hey, that's it. Time!

543
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,017
Hey, back off. That's enough!
What's the matter with you?

544
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:19,021
- Tommy, are you crazy or something?
- What's the matter with you, man?

545
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,024
- I'm sorry.
- Go cool off, kid. Sorry about this.

546
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,651
He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.

547
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:28,113
Hey, look,
goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones.

548
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,367
- I'm sorry. But what do you think?
- What do I think? I don't think you listen.

549
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,579
But you brawl
like you was a street fighter.

550
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:39,500
I know somethin' about that,
but this is boxing. It ain't mugging.

551
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:44,713
- I'm sorry, but I know I can do it all.
- Yeah? Well, not on this date, OK?

552
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,467
- That's it?
- I gotta work with these kids here.

553
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:51,220
How about you tryin' to manage me?

554
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,596
- Manage?
- Yeah.

555
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,641
Unless you think I ain't got nothin' goin'.

556
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,226
Nothin' goin'?

557
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:02,731
Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got
a lot of tools. But I ain't no manager.

558
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:05,776
The gentleman that owned
this place was a manager.

559
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:09,446
But me, I was always the managed... guy.

560
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:13,158
Hey, look. Good luck, all right?

561
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,080
All right, guys. Let's go.

562
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,249
Come on. Move around.

563
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,460
That's it. Nice.

564
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:39,560
All right, you guys, come on.
No cheap shots. Move it around.

565
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:49,236
How you doing?

566
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,822
Cold? You look cold.

567
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:57,119
I guess it has something
to do with the weather.

568
00:42:57,286 --> 00:42:59,621
Here. Take my coat.

569
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,624
No, thanks. Where's your boyfriend?

570
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,670
Him? Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

571
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,799
I'm Jewel, if you wanna know.

572
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,595
I'm Robert.

573
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,346
Hi.

574
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:22,936
Well, I been living here about
six years now. It ain't Disneyland!

575
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,814
- You been to Disneyland?
- Sure.

576
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,650
You make it sound like everybody has.

577
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:34,156
I know you can't tell by the way I look,
but I ain't like the other kids around here.

578
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,117
Why? I mean,
what makes you so different?

579
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:41,872
I don't know. I guess it's cos
I wanna get out. You know how it is.

580
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:47,377
You know, for an Italian kid,
you ain't got a bad butt.

581
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,557
- First money I get, I'm goin' to Miami.
- Why Miami?

582
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:05,187
- Miami needs new gigolos.
- Yeah, I read somethin' like that.

583
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:11,527
My back is getting bad.
How come you don't have arthritis?

584
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:14,446
Ain't I got enough?

585
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,533
Adrian's too good for this.

586
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,868
This place really depresses me, Paul.

587
00:44:20,035 --> 00:44:23,205
Yo! Rock. Come inside.
Everybody's been askin' for ya.

588
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:26,583
- No, thanks. I'm a little beat.
- Hey, I'm a little thirsty.

589
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,544
- You go if you wanna.
- Mr Balboa?

590
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,297
- Look at this. Tommy Gunn.
- Why are you still hanging around?

591
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:37,177
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Yeah. I'd like to try again.

592
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:41,306
Kid, I'd like to help, but I really
don't know nothin' about managin'.

593
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:46,311
Man, all I'm askin' for is a chance.
If I screw up, then hell, I'll leave.

594
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:50,566
- What have you got to lose?
- Me? Nothin'. It's what you got to lose.

595
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,734
- I got nothin' to lose.
- Maybe you do.

596
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:56,697
What if I don't do good, right?
And you don't make it?

597
00:44:56,864 --> 00:45:00,117
I don't want you blaming me for this,
kid, you know?

598
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:04,705
Here's what I would do if I was you.
Listen to me. If I was you,

599
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:09,418
I would go home and talk to your family
people. Come up with somethin' better.

600
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,880
I got no family people.
All I got is what you see here.

601
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,800
I know all about you, back from
your first fight with Apollo Creed.

602
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:19,803
I read about how no one
ever gave you a chance.

603
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,765
I'm not from the same streets as you,
but I'm hungry, like you were.

604
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:26,310
Ever since I put on gloves
I've wanted to meet you.

605
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:30,772
Cos I knew that if anybody could
make me a winner, it was you.

606
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:33,817
Hey, Paulie,
you see a winner standing here?

607
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:37,529
Yes! Man, you beat the best.
Nobody could ever say different.

608
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:41,742
Look, Rocky, you don't know me,
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

609
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,203
And if I can't, I'll bust my butt tryin'.

610
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:50,584
I'm not hustlin' you, man. All I'm askin'
for is a chance. I mean, just one shot.

611
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,721
Are you hungry?

612
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,516
Yeah.

613
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:08,602
Yeah? Come on.

614
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,563
You're really gonna like
the way Adrian cooks.

615
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,609
She does amazing things with macaroni,
especially tomatoes.

616
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:20,072
But I gotta warn you,
she can be a little vicious with the garlic!

617
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:26,286
- So why'd this kid smack your face?
- It really doesn't matter, Dad.

618
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:29,748
- It does matter. They took his coat.
- I don't want the coat.

619
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:31,917
They took the one with the collar?

620
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:34,795
- I'll go to your school and...
- You'll make it worse.

621
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:38,215
- Can't I do what I think is right?
- What do you think is right?

622
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,218
- A baseball bat across the face.
- Paulie!

623
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,762
- Adrian, can I have the plate?
- Yes, Rocky.

624
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:46,515
I had trouble like that
when I was in school.

625
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:50,602
Every day I got chased by this kid,
till one day my mother said to me:

626
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:53,730
- "Pretend the guy's like a balloon".
- Balloon?

627
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:57,901
She said if you pop 'em hard,
these guys just go away.

628
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:03,282
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son
so he can handle his problems

629
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:06,118
with his mind, not his muscles.

630
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:08,328
- Sorry.
- That's why I'll get mangled.

631
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:12,207
- You ain't gonna get mangled.
- Dad, will you teach me how to fight?

632
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:14,042
A baseball bat would be nice.

633
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:17,129
Do you wanna grow up
and just use your fists?

634
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:19,631
Adrian, I don't think it'd be so bad

635
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:23,844
if I taught him how to throw a few...
deadly punches.

636
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,513
Tommy, did your dad teach you to fight?

637
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,392
- No, not exactly. I had to...
- Sweetheart, don't get personal.

638
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,313
No, it's OK. You see, my old man,
he used to drink a lot. Seriously.

639
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:38,859
He'd go out with his friends, then
he'd come home, look to punch on me.

640
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:42,696
He'd punch on my mother, too.
He did that a lot of times.

641
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:46,200
So growing up,
I only thought about fightin' my father.

642
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,369
You know, when I was 1 3,
I got in trouble at school.

643
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:52,998
He tied me down and whipped me
so bad I couldn't walk for a week.

644
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,709
I couldn't do anything.

645
00:47:55,876 --> 00:48:01,590
The first guy I ever knocked out was my
father. In the ring, it's like all I see is him.

646
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,384
That's kinda sick, huh?

647
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:09,306
Yo, Tommy, at least you had
an old man to knock out, you know?

648
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,352
Yeah.

649
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,940
- I didn't even have that.
- Some day you can punch out your pop.

650
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:23,695
- Paulie, what you telling him that for?
- It's the fittest of the survival.

651
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:29,576
- Tommy, where you stayin' tonight?
- Oh, I'll find some place to stay.

652
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:33,580
No, I tell you what.
We got room down in the basement.

653
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,250
- What about me?
- Your son is sleeping there.

654
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,671
- Well, he can stay with his uncle.
- What am I, a pit stop?

655
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,049
I don't wanna cause any problems.
I can find a place to stay.

656
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:48,387
No, it's OK.
It's just for a little while, you know.

657
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:53,058
Right? No problem at all. Hey, kid.
I appreciate it. It's cold outside.

658
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:57,980
- I'm not changing no sheets.
- Hey, since when have you ever?

659
00:48:58,147 --> 00:49:01,984
Tommy, why don't you come on down?
We'll show you the whole place.

660
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:07,364
Why don't you go downstairs and
show your father what you did today?

661
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:14,204
Hey, Junior!
Your plumbing don't leak, do it?

662
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,922
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. He hits hard.

663
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:30,012
- Adrian can really cook!
- Yeah, she's OK. Listen, Tommy.

664
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,807
We ain't had a chance
to get this place too nice.

665
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:37,311
We'll get it together in a while, you know?

666
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:40,522
- Wow! Man, this is what it's about.
- Holy mackerel!

667
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,400
Why do you keep this stuff down here?

668
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:47,738
When did you get a chance to do this?
He took it all out of a box. It's beautiful.

669
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:51,533
You painted... When did you
get a chance to do this, kid?

670
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,412
- After school. It's no big deal.
- Where'd you get the glove?

671
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,374
Oh, this? Thanks.
This is one of my favourite objects.

672
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:04,087
Mickey give me this before he departed.
It was Rocky Marciano's cuff link.

673
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:08,050
- Really? The real Rocky Marciano?
- You got me thinkin' about Mickey.

674
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:11,553
I wanna show you something.
He told me a long time ago...

675
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,142
He says that fighting
is like 90% in the skull

676
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,811
and 10% in the body.
This is what he says to me.

677
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:23,941
- Dad, I met this really nice girl today.
- Really? That's wonderful.

678
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:27,945
- She's a lot better than...
- Wait a minute. Don't change the station.

679
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:31,365
I'll be right back.
I just wanna tell Tommy a few things.

680
00:50:31,532 --> 00:50:35,244
Hey, who was your best friend
back in Orlando?

681
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:38,580
- That's Oklahoma.
- Well, yeah.

682
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,083
- Eric Elder.
- No, no.

683
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,794
Your best friend is
a guy named Frankie Fear.

684
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:48,549
You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.
It ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.

685
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:53,720
You see, fear keeps you sharp. It keeps
you awake. It makes you wanna survive.

686
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:57,224
But the thing is,
you gotta learn how to control it.

687
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,978
Cos fear is like this fire
and it's burning deep inside.

688
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:04,231
Now, if you control it, Tommy,
it's gonna make you hot.

689
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:07,067
But, you see,
if this thing here controls you,

690
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:11,488
it's gonna burn you and everythin'
else around you up. That's right.

691
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,867
Anyway, these are the things
that was taught to me

692
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,495
and, if you want, I'd like to teach to you.

693
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,248
This mean you're gonna manage me?

694
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:24,626
- Absolutely. Hey, home team.
- All right!

695
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:28,088
- Let's go for it.
- Do you mind showin' me a few things?

696
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:30,674
Sure, Tommy. I'll show you a lot of things.

697
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,932
Hey, rich boy.
How much you got in your pocket today?

698
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,976
- Nothin'.
- Come on, let's have it.

699
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:43,854
- I got nothin'.
- Come on, gimme the money.

700
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,523
- Come on!
- Hey, I gotta eat.

701
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,735
He's hungry, he's gotta eat. Well, eat this.

702
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:54,907
I got it. Go!

703
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,909
Father Carmine!

704
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,329
Father Carmine!

705
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,915
- Maybe he's not home.
- Priests is always home.

706
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:10,797
I didn't wanna
disturb you that much, Father.

707
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,303
Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect.

708
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,847
Father, this is my new friend,
Tommy Gunn.

709
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,981
I was wondering... Tommy here's
a fighter and I'm his manager.

710
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:31,109
I wondered if you'd do me
a favour, if you ain't busy.

711
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:36,198
Could you throw us a couple blessings?
One, that I don't mess up as a manager.

712
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,952
And B, that Tommy does
as good as I think he can do: great.

713
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,080
And don't get hurt none.
Could you do that?

714
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:54,216
I love it when he does that.
Thanks, Father! Really appreciate this.

715
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,387
- Any time.
- OK. I'll see you in church.

716
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:07,187
- Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
- It don't hurt havin' an angel on your side.

717
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:13,861
- Hey, Rock. How's it going?
- Doin' great, guys.

718
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:15,863
Slow down or you'll get a ticket!

719
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:19,283
- This is Tommy Gunn. He'll be a champ.
- How you doin', Tom?

720
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:32,254
All right, break it up. Break!

721
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:46,560
Get off the ropes!

722
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,861
- Go easy.
- Man, I need more work.

723
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,906
- No, you're ready.
- No, this guy's killing me.

724
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:02,159
- You're ready now. You're perfect.
- He's killing me.

725
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:05,037
- I feel weak.
- No, listen to me. Shut up!

726
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,790
Mick used to say the only difference
between a hero and a coward

727
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,919
is the hero's willing to go for it.
Take the shot.

728
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:14,880
This guy here is scared too.
You're both scared.

729
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:19,218
Remember in the basement we talked
about fear? How it was like this fire?

730
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:23,096
You gotta control it or it burns you up.
Or it's gonna burn him up.

731
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:25,140
Make it work for you, Tommy.

732
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:28,435
I would never do nothin'
to hurt you, understand?

733
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:32,981
Fear is like this fire, OK? Now let it burn
until it becomes like this volcano.

734
00:54:33,148 --> 00:54:36,819
When you see the openin',
explode all over this guy, OK?

735
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:40,864
Now, you can take him, OK?
It ain't all muscle, it's all heart.

736
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:44,868
Heart and fire! OK, now you do it.

737
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:49,665
Remember,
I'm like this angel on your shoulder.

738
00:54:49,832 --> 00:54:53,001
I ain't gonna let nothin' happen to you.
Go for it.

739
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,883
Come on, Tommy. Jab!

740
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,431
Left, right!

741
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,101
The body!
