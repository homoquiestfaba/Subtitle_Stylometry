a land shrouded in mystery,</i>

<i>A group of magical islands

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,975
<i>A nation of rival provinces</i>

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>whose lords were ruled by a
shogun whose will is absolute.</i>

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>Peace in the realm is
kept by the samurai,</i>

7

<i>master swordsmen</i>

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,322

10

<i>Should a samurai ever
lose or fail his master,</i>

11
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>he suffers the greatest shame
in all Japanese society.</i>

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,001
<i>He becomes a ronin.</i>

13
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,631
<i>And yet, to know the
story of the 47 Ronin,</i>

14
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>is to know the story of all Japan.</i>

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,681
<i>It began with a boy.</i>

16
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>No one knew where he came from
or how he found his way to Ako.</i>

17
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,982
<i>Some said he was a changeling,
no better than a beast.</i>

18
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,073
<i>Many believed he'd been
raised by the Tengu,</i>

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,038

their dark powers</i>

21

<i>The evil he had fled had
left its mark upon him.</i>

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,481
Oishi!

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,443
My Lord, it is a demon.

25
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,207
He's a child, just like you.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,003
Help me pick him up, Oishi.

NARRATOR:
<i>Lord Asano, of the province Ako,</i>

28
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,177
<i>saved him that day,</i>

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>seeing something in the
boy that Oishi did not.</i>

30
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,774
<i>Lord Asano's daughter,
Mika, saw it too.</i>

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>Mika's father allowed the
boy to live amongst them,</i>

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,884
Look.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,303
What do you see?

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,013
A branch?

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,765
No.

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,976
It's a deer.

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,689
- Oh.
- It took this path.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,328

NARRATOR:
<i>The samurai believed his presence</i>

41
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,708

OISHI: Kai.

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,122
Well?

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,969
There is something wrong
with the creature.

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:55,003
It's up there on the rise, but
it will come down again to hunt.

51
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,714
It would be safer to set a
trap and wait for it here.

52
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,099
It's up on the rise, Lord Asano.

Ako owes you a great debt, Yasuno.

66
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,398
We can finally welcome
the Shogun without fear.

00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,376
Well done.

(HORSES RETREATING)

71
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,719
Get out.

72
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,140
Get out!

73
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,580
Does Lord Asano live?

74
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,751
Yes.

75
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,336
Mmm.

MIKA:
Hosting the Shogun's tournament

77
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,606
is a great honor for my father.

78
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,399
Everything must be perfect.

79
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,610
My Lady, Mika.

80
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,363
Lord Asano and the hunting
party have returned.

81
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,281
They killed the beast.

Father!

84
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,469
I was worried.

85
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,971
The hunt took longer than we hoped.

86
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,016
Yasuno showed great courage.

87
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,561
Is anyone badly hurt?

88
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,691
Who are you looking for?

89
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,033
Is everything prepared
for the Shogun's arrival?

90
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,994
Yes, Father.

91
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,668
LORD ASANO: I want all of
Ako to share in this honor

92
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,421
of hosting our great commander.

93
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,401
MIKA:
I have made special arrangements

94
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
for the visiting lords, as well.

95
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,892
I've ordered stands put
up all along the route.

96
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,855
Your mother would have been proud.

97
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,193
(WOOD STRIKING)

98
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,291
I was worried.

99
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,294
You always worry.

100
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,301
RIKU: He so wants your approval.

101
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,221
Chikara has been training
every chance he gets.

102
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,445
My Lady, Kai has returned.

103
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,938
They told me you were hurt.

104
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,981
It's nothing, My Lady.

105
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,528
Your back.

106
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,533
Sit down.

107
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,625
Someone should have
seen to this before.

108
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,804
Thank you.

109
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,441
I saw the shame in Yasuno's eyes
when they were praising him.

110
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,446
Even when you try to help
them, they hate you.

111
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,992
Your father's samurai have always
treated me as well as can be expected.

112
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
And is that all you expect?

113
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,540
It's all I know.

114
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,211
It doesn't have to be, Kai.

115
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,182
This is no place for you, My Lady.

116
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,518
Are you sending me away?

117
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,941
Look at me and tell
me you don't love me.

118
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,360
I will always love you.

119
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,529
But you have your place

120
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,324
and I have mine.

121
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,729
Asano <i>Takumi no Kami,</i> ruler of Ako.

00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,940
His Highness, Shogun Tokugawa,

lord of provinces and
master of all Japan

124
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,613
thanks you for your welcome.

125
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,574
Lord Asano,

126
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,285
my friend.

127
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,787
Ako is magnificent,

128
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,664
as always.

129
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,462
We anticipate with pleasure
tomorrow's tournament.

130
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,424
LORD ASANO:
Great Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi...

131
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,442
and hope the entertainment
we have prepared

132
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,486
meets your august approval.

133
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,657
Father.

134
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,827
What are you doing in my home?

135
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,247
Last week at the hunt I saw a fox.

136
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,001
I didn't realize at the
time that it was a witch.

137
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,878
A witch?

138
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,839
I believe I saw the same
creature again tonight.

139
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,009
She was in human form among
the nobles' concubines.

140
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,471
My Lord.

141
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,522
They say only demons have the power

142
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,149
to see past a witch's disguise.

143
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,696
Are you a demon?

144
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
No.

145
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,913
Then I suggest you are simply
bewitched by a beautiful girl.

00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:59,264

present Lord Kira Yoshinaka,

147

master of Nagato, from
the northern provinces.

148
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,367
Ako is as beautiful as I
remember, Lord Asano.

149
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,620
We are honored by your
visit, Lord Kira.

150
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,667
I look forward to the tournament.

00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,684
I had no idea your concubine
was so lovely, Lord Asano.

152

She's my daughter.

153

154
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,443
Forgive me, My Lady.

155
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,031

daughter sit with us?

No!

185
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,745
Forgive me, My Lord.

186
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,873
The fault is mine.

Strip him of his armor.

188
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,226

189
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,324
Stop!

190
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:19,996

194
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,783
Lord Asano's mind is unsettled.

195
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,412
It is time to take Ako.

196
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:05,291
It is what you hoped for,
it is what we have planned for.

197
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,545
What are you afraid of, My Lord?

198
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,717
Show me your courage.

199
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:17,012
Give me your heart.

200

is no turning back.

Everyone, go back to your posts!

The law is clear.

228
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,786
You have struck an unarmed guest
and have shamed your home.

229
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,122
The penalty is death.

230
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:17,252
Because of your rank and the
service you have done Ako,

231
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,631
I will allow you to regain your
honor and the honor of your house

232
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,883
through seppuku,

233
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,469
death by your own hand,

234
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,058
so that you may show courage
and dignity in death

235
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:35,645
as you once showed in life.

236
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:43,486
The Shogun could have had
me hanged like a criminal.

237
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:49,159
Instead, he has allowed me

238
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:53,663
to take my life with honor.

239
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,292
You were bewitched, My Lord.

240
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,627
Your mind was poisoned.

241
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,465
If I accept my fate,

242
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,928
no one will question the
honor of our people

would act as my second,

Lady Asano,

267
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,113
I am sorry for your father's death.

268
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,573
He accepted it with dignity.

269
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:24,703
Your Highness, as my
father's only child,

270
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:29,582
I ask that I may look after his
lands until such time as I marry.

271
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,752
I have already considered
this, My Lady.

272
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:46,433
So that there will be no
feud between your clans,

273
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,144
I decree that from this day,

274
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,146
they will be one.

275
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:55,775
Sealed by the marriage bond
between you and Lord Kira.

276
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,945
You are granted one year to mourn.

277
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:03,658
But you will remain a guest of
Lord Kira's until you are married.

I forbid you to seek vengeance
for Lord Asano's death.

Lord Kira,

283
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:25,305
I leave Ako with you.

284
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:48,536
From this moment on, you are
banished from these lands.

285
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:51,247
Those who remain
will be hunted down

286
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,251
and executed.

287
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,605
You will never see him again, My Lady.
Take a last look.

He no longer has the
protection of his rank.

290

Throw him in the pit.

291
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,145

for their wedding.

368
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,813
Oishi.

369
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:19,496
Find Oishi. I need him dead.

370
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:40,392
(SHOUTS)

371
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,018
Yasuno, it's Oishi!

(EXCLAIMS)

373
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,689
He's back!

374
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:47,094
RONIN 1: Everyone, Oishi's back!

375
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,817
RONIN 2: Oishi's back!

376
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,709
Father.

377
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:06,876
Well done, Chikara.

378
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,689
OISHI: Today we may be ronin,

379
00:52:28,565 --> 00:52:31,735
but now the time has come.

380
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:36,156
What I propose ends in death.

381
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,909
Even if we succeed,

382
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:46,082
we will be hanged as criminals
for defying the Shogun's orders.

383
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:52,505
I take a vow before you

384
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:57,260
that I will not rest
until justice is done,

385
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,723
will not sleep until our
master lies in peace,

386
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,808
and will not pray

387
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:08,104
unless it is to ask the
heavens' forgiveness

388
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,148
for sending Kira to hell!

389
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,775
(ALL CHEERING)

390
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:27,457
There are only two ways in.

391
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,292
The main gate here

392
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,878
and this point beneath
the west wall.

393
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,172
Both are heavily guarded.

394
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:38,802
Our best chance is to strike when Kira
leaves the safety of his fortress.

395
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:42,972
He will travel to his ancestors'
shrine to offer prayers.

396
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:45,934
We don't know yet when he
will make the journey.

397
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:50,146
Isogai, you ride ahead
to his temple town

398
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:51,648
and see what you can find out.

399
00:53:52,315 --> 00:53:54,818
Remember, even near holy sites

400
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:58,655
there are brothels and plenty of
loose-tongued officials who visit them.

401
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:03,284
Even if we know the route, we
will need more men for an ambush.

402
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,328
Then we'll get them.

403
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,664
You and Chuzaemon and Okuda

404
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,667
will gather as many of our
former samurai as you can

405
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,795
and meet us here at a farmhouse
Horibe has found for us.

406
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:19,884
Forgive me, sir, but how can we
succeed without good swords?

407
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,137
Take mine.

408
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:26,516
When we meet again,
I'll have more waiting for you.

409
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:31,104
The rest of us will go to Uetsu.

410
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,648
The finest swordmakers
in the land work there.

411
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,567
Why is the half-breed here?

412
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,697
I asked him to come.

413
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:43,366
We can't take him with us.
He's not a samurai.

414
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:51,708
None of us are samurai anymore.

415
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:41,299
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

416
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,435
Who are you?

417
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:55,814
We are farmers from Shimobe, sir.

418
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,441
We have come to buy tools.

419
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,611
This is Lord Kira's village now.

420
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:21,923
These are not farmer's hands.

421
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,958
Take the swords, whatever
you can salvage.

422
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,544
We'll need more.

423
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:02,797
Help him.

424
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:14,768
Eat, My Lady.

425
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:29,199
You think I care if you starve?

426
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:33,119
Soon my lord will be
ruler of all Japan

427
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:37,248
and you can take your life
like your father did.

428
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,459
You killed my father.

429
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,213
Weren't you the one
who broke his heart?

430
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,133
You betrayed him with your lust.

431
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:08,780
We can go to Hida.
They will give us weapons.

432
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,574
You will find nothing in Hida.

433
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:15,245
Kira's men will have taken
over this entire region.

434
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:17,580
There is another way.

435
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,794
You will find swords
in the Sea of Trees.

436
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:25,463
The Tengu Forest.

437
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:29,801
That is just a myth.

438
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:32,762
I've seen them.

439
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,368
How do you know about
the Tengu Forest?

440
00:58:56,661 --> 00:58:59,956
I was raised there
before I fled to Ako.

441
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:03,626
Those scars on your head.

442
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,338
Are they the ones who marked you?

443
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:08,757
Yes.

444
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:10,967
And taught you to fight?

445
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,802
To kill.

446
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:14,971
They have many strange
and magical ways

447
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,140
to protect themselves
and their beliefs.

448
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:23,146
They wanted to show me that this
life has nothing to offer but death.

449
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:29,361
They wanted me to be like
them and renounce the world.

450
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:34,115
I vowed never to use the
magical powers they taught me.

451
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:38,953
Although I was still a child,
I knew my place was among other men.

452
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,626
And do you think that these
Tengu would give us weapons?

453
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,464
They will test our will.

She wants me to find her the best
view of Lord Kira's procession.

will leave his fortress,

not even his own guards.

460

He will hurry back
before anyone is awake.

462
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,017
Yuki.

Are we lost?

466

Whatever happens in
there, whatever you see,

Then take it.

01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:37,961
These swords were forged to defend
us against the hatred of men.

Men who persecuted
us for our beliefs.

you for being different.

and a peasant girl.

back on those gifts.

Will you give me what I ask?

531
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:40,477
Take the blade, Kai.

532
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,645
If you can reach it before me.

about these swords?

01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,072
It depends.

544
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:17,991
On what?

545
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,577
Who uses them.

(MEN LAUGHING)

549
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:55,737
I think mine is broken.

550
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:21,554
Your sword.

551
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,724
You keep it, Hazama.
I told you we'd bring others.

552
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:41,032
I have the information
you requested.

553
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:44,661
Lord Kira leaves for his
ancestors' shrine tonight.

554
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,831
Well done.

555
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,709
Come, Isogai. Gather the men.

556
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:52,669
CHIKARA: Father.

557
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,047
I want to go with you.

558
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:57,882
No.

559
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:00,427
Horibe, stay with him.

560
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:37,047
I ride to my ancestors' shrine
to offer thanks for our wedding.

561
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,841
Is there anything you
wish me to pray for?

562
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,345
My Lord will not like my answer.

563
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:46,222
You may look down on me, My Lady,

564
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,393
but our children and their
children will be of one blood.

565
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,170

01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:46,908

573
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:16,688
Yasuno!

574
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:19,649

578
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,306
- No!
- Oishi!

(YELLS)

580
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:31,054
It belonged to Oishi, My Lord.

581
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:49,406
Your half-breed is dead.

582
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:57,372
So are dozens of your father's men.

583
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,292
All killed

584
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,712
trying to save you.

585
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:11,636
Perhaps now you understand

586
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,597
the price of your love.

587
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:22,605
I promised my lord

588
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:26,776
I would not harm

589
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,405
a hair on your head.

590
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,957
But what you do to yourself

591
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,878
is not my concern.

592
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:05,315
Good night.

593
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:58,827
BASHO: Kai.

594
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:02,622
I have a confession to make.

595
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:06,209
When I was a boy,

596
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:10,422
I used to wait in the
woods outside your hut,

597
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:14,426
and when you came out,

598
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:18,888
I'd throw stones at you,

599
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,224
then hide.

600
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,896
I knew it was you.

601
01:17:27,772 --> 01:17:30,900
I could see your belly sticking
out from behind the trees.

602
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,695
(GRUNTING)

603
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:43,747
I'm sorry, Kai.

604
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:46,958
You're a good man.

605
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,990
I should have acted the
day Lord Asano died.

606
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:23,536
Our anger should have
been sudden and swift.

607
01:18:25,538 --> 01:18:27,957
Then even if we'd failed,

608
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,296
it would have been with honor.

609
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,811
You are samurai.

610
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,566
We still have swords and
the advantage of surprise.

611
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,362
Kira thinks we're ghosts.

612
01:18:58,488 --> 01:19:01,449
We can use that,
turn it to our advantage.

613
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,786
He'll never expect us.

614
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:10,000
We can still do what we came for.

615
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:34,691
Eat.

616
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:38,778

620

What is this?

621
01:20:20,528 --> 01:20:24,741
We are not some village troupe
to be held up by bandits.

622
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:28,745
Lord Kira himself has hired us
to perform at his wedding.

623
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:32,040
I have the letters and
passes to prove it.

624
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,249
There is no need.

625
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,211
We saw you perform in Ako.

626
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,758
You are Lord Asano's men.

627
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,470
We need your help.

628
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:52,268
YASUNO: Kai.

629
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,781
Forgive me for not thanking
you for defeating the beast

630
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,074
and saving my life.

631
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:12,789
A samurai does not take credit
for victories of others.

632
01:21:19,921 --> 01:21:21,297
This belonged to Basho.

When a wrong is unavenged,

637
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:48,033
the heavens look
down on us in shame.

<i>We too must die for this circle
of vengeance to be closed.</i>

we were and what we did.</i>

<i>or when his time will come.</i>

645
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:42,754
<i>But soon all that will be
left of our brief lives</i>

646
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,551

For the crime of disobedience,

you should all be executed

718
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,826
this world was only a
preparation for the next,

719
01:44:05,036 --> 01:44:10,291

we leave it having loved
