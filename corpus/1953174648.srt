270
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,220

279
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,330
He hasn't told you, has he?

280
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,790
Yeah.

281
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,160
So what you gonna do?

282
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,020

287
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,590

I go after the thief.

298
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,170

00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,370
He robbed my arm!

305
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,780
Let me just say this one last thing,
and then i'll shut up.

306
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,500
I care because you've worked
hard for this place.

307
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,270
I didn't know what was gonna
happen to us...

308
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,090
And then a call came through...
and it was you...and...

309
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,480
and you... you sent for us...
uh...you've rescued us

310
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,390
And brought us here.

311
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,800
and every day i would wake up...
and think i was dreaming.

312
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,590
Have you seen my resume?

313
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,485
What resume?

314
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,630
Exactly. What about Sweets?

315
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Chep, we can't keep him
in the dark forever.

316
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,590
You keep your voice down!

317
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,430
I'm bringing that kid along
slowly bit by bit..

318
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
I've figured if i told him all at once
he's a lot to go Bugnut-e.

319
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:13,375
Hum... what is that?

320
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,970
Bugnut-e. You know, its just running

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,490
Hamish...

322
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,790
The place just isn't turning a profit
anymore Ok?.

323
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:22,487
What am i supposed to do?

324
00:31:22,522 --> 00:31:24,150
We've got all a little soft.
admittedly...

325
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,290
I mean, when was the last time
any of us did anything productive?

326
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:29,000
We've lost track

327
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,220
And this is why you're feeling
what you're feeling...

328
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,221
- What the hell is that i'm
feeling what i'm feeling?

329
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,670

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,500
It's about those gorillas?

349
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,700
- Gorillas?
- No.

350
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,341
A prop of your's was stolen from
the set of Betty Bumcakes,

351
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,400
some rhinoceros eyes.

352

Those fuckers...

00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,760
Yeah well. They've filed a report.

354
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,510
So, since when they put a detective
on the trail of a stolen prop?.

355
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,820
I don't know really, but they
gave it to me, so here i am.

356
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,821
That's kind'a fucked up job uh?

357
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,630
Yeah.

358
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,970
Thanks.

359
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,500
There was also a robbery,
last night across the street,

360
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,670
a womans prosthetic arm
was taken.

361
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,650
Do we get a prosthetic
arm today?

362
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,900
- No.
- No, sorry.

363
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,790
Well it looks like ahh... same suspect
might pulled both jobs.

364
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,875
Wow it's fucking ugly.

365
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,480
Sweets, did your mother stealed
some ones prosthetic arm last night?

366
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,240
No, sorry i can't help you.

367
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Kinda looks like Tor Johnson.

368
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,690
Tor Johnson?

369
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,270
The wrestler.

370
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,900
Maybe the greatest fucking wrestler
of all times, and a very good actor.

371
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,230
It was a giant and the horror...

372
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:28,086
Yeah, but it's dead now so you're barking
at the wrong pole there pal..

373
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,100
Hey, you know that mask we
got Chep for Halloween,

374
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,450
i think that's supposed
to be Tor Johnson.

375
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,010
A mask?

376
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,260
uh?

377
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,810
Who's Chep?

378
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,450
Just this kid i got
working for me.

379
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,640
He's a good kid, keeps to himself, he
wouldn't get mixed in anything like this.

380
00:34:47,675 --> 00:34:49,282
Besides he never
leaves the place,

381
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,683
I mean literally hasn't been out of
here in... like what 3 years?.

382
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:54,890
I tried to take him out one night, he just
became scared and backed here so...

383
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,220
you're wasting
your time.

384
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,700
How do you spell that... Chep?

385
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know...

386
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,700
With a "C".

387
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,810
"H"?

388
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,390
I woul'd go with a "C"

389
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,120
Maybe you could tell me
a little more about him.

390
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,670
I'd appreciate it.

391
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
Chep it's what you'd call... an idiot.

392
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,575
- Idiot S...
- Savant!

393
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,700
Idiot savant.

394
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,240
I only hire idiot's savant's.

395
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,710
How long has Chep been
working for you?

396
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:34,915
- Few years.
- Three years.

397
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,340
He just sort of showed up
with a load i bought at an auction.

398
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,750
What do you mean?

399
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,613
Well seems Chep lived his all life
with his grandparents,

400
00:35:42,614 --> 00:35:44,950
and... quite
tragically they died

401
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,050
City auctioned all
what they had

402
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,185
- Which's some primo shit by the way.
- Rather good stuff, still have it in it's own section.

403
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,275
And when Chep came along with the
delivery we just... sort of uh. Took him in.

404
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,460
I's been here ever since
He doesn't know he works around any more.

405
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,380
So, it's all i've gotta
say about that

406
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,440
You think it would be
possible if i spoke with Chep?

407
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,215
Yeah go ahead.

408
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,930
He's in the back somewhere.

409
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,900
Yeah.

410
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,895
Over there?

411
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:28,000
"The back" is everywhere behind
the front of this desk.

412
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,650
Chep is generally back there.

413
00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,500
I'll have a look
thank you

414
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:36,010
This is my card.

415
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,210
First of all your lady friend,

416
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,790
you have to do more than gather
bits and pieces for her

417
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,620
She wants more than that.

418
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,970
And you need more from her,
understand?

419
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:59,000
Second, watch out for this guy, don't let
him get between you and your journey,

420
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
don't let him take you
away from her.

421
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,960
Tell him... nothing.

422
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay.

423
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,840
Are you Chep?

424
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,630
No.

425
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,450
Yes...

426
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,960
I'm detective Barbara i was wondering
if I could ask you... a few questions

427
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
No.

428
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,270
It'll only take a few minutes.

429
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,745
There were some robberies.

430
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,785
One involving a prop
from here, and...

431
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,840
one, last night across
the street

432
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,870
I was wondering if you
knew anything about that

433
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,220
You know you're boss tells me
that you actually live here

434
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,760
Yeah...

435
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,100
I'd like to take a look
at you room if...

436
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,975
That'll be alright with you.

437
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,510
Well i live everywhere.

438
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,800
Everywhere.?

439
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,050
All over, i live in all the rooms.

440
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,130
That's quite a space.

441
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,890
what, do you think you could
show me around... anyway?

442
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,090
I'll apreciate that.

443
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:22,950
Okay.

444
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,370
A cross, a cross.

445
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,590
It's a very big cross.

446
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,880
Back here is, our medical supplies.

447
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:00,570
Hey Chep what's uh... up here?

448
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,530
That is...

449
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,980
- That is.... boxes and... junk
- Can i take a look?

450
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:11,000
Back here is...
it's more interesting back here.

451
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,730
- But, can i see this first, it's okay?
- Okay, be careful.

452
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,530
It's an odd place for a chair.

453
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Is it...?

454
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,090
In front of the window.

455
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,800
Yeah... is the window.

456
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:48,342
You know that robbery i told
you about, last night

457
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:51,050
took place in that house
right over there.

458
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,490
Really?

459
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,710
Yeah.

460
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,420
May i see the mask you
wore for Haloween?

461
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,920
What mask?

462
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,700
Well, you were given
a mask for Haloween...

463
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,800
May i see it please?

464
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,190
I didn't wore a
mask for Haloween.

465
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,990
I don't even have
any masks.

466
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,190
What wore you
for Haloween?

467
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,570
Just me.

468
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,280
I think you got me mixed up
with some other masked person.

469
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Who said anything about
a masked person?

470
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,510
- Y-you just said.
- No, i didn't.

471
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:38,510
- Yes you did.
- No i didn't.

472
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,330
Well i'm here all the time,
i never leave here so...

473
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:42,330
Thats what your boss told me.

474
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,540
Yeah, Bundy.

475
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,890
Thats a good alibi.

476
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Thanks.

477
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,930
But... i dont' buy it.

478
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,310
So you're sure you never
leave this place?

479
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,680
safe, uh?

480
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,740
My god!

481
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,560
Thats from the fantastic
purple triumph isn't it?

482
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,420
Thats the "Purple Triumph"?

483
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,780
I've know, i've seen it 30 times

484
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,950
Have you seen it?

485
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,215
No.

486
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,000
And the finale, when John Philmore
finally uncovers it...

487
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,460
and dances with Faye Roberson...

488
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,290
Yeah...

489
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,020
I can't believe
i'm holding this.

490
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,000
This is a piece of
Hollywood history

491
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,640
"The Purple Triumph"...

492
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,390
May i purchase this?

493
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,650
You've go to front desk
and ask Bundy.

494
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,110
- He's the boss.
- Fantastic!

495
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,160
I should look around here a bit more
i wonder what else's is hidding in here.

496
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Jesus

497
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,060

501
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,250
Okay.

502
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,990

00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,970
- I've been awake since 5 this morning.
- Since 5?

505
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,315
Actually this, wasn't so bad.

506
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,440
It was one of our easier days.

507
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:55,975
How was your day?
hope not as bad.

508
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,300
Oh my god!

509
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,630
Come and seat.

510
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,810
Ah, would you start the entries

511
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,300

Red wine?

00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,900
Okay, red wine.

513
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,500
Yes, that'll be all.

514
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,530
You may go.

515
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,210
You can go now!

516
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,570
I said, that will be all.

517
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,800
Sorry.

518
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,020
Oh my god!

519
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,820
Did you...?
Did you do, all of this?

520
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

521
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,220
God... It's ahh beautiful.

522
00:44:36,255 --> 00:44:37,255
¡Oh wait!.

523
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,625
Oh you have....

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,410
I... god...

526
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,540
Try-- try the steak.

Okay.

528
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,200
I should know.

529
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,750
You have something

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,560
<i>"It must be sand".</i>

537
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,000

540
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:59,800
Really.

541
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,500
You know, have you ever
thought about working on the sets?

542
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,000
In the arts department?

543
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,180

544
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,860

You know?, i know how that's feel.
I mean i feel like i live in my sets

548
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,300
And i guess i do
in a weird way.

549
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,108
- I mean... I don't get out
in the real world... much.

550
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:42,601
Real world?

551
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,890
Exactly, exactly...

552
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,700

Isn't it?

553
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,890
Chep.

554
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,180
You know what?...they dont
understand this...

555
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,810
and what you do, is that...
it all has to be real, somehow...

556
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,800
You know it has to... it has to
breathe. Like this does,

557
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,800
- To breathe like you and me.
- Yeah...

558
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:27,410
So... God i'm sorry ... you know what
i'm really gonna have to get going.

Dont' lose her!

573
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:56,930
Courage! Do things you wouldn't normally

574
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,450
Become what your'e not.

We are only here to
guide you, Chep.

Are we scaring you?

583
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:22,860
Use us when you need us, and then
hide us back up on the shelfs when you've done,

584
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,070
like relics with no past?.

585
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,010
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Save you're settlements for her.

586
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,800
That's if she's even coming back.

587
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,450
How quiet props house
is after dark.

588
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,240
Why dont' you show me

<i>The desert sands at Morocco

That was really weird.

596
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,050
Always really weird.

597
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,560
Are you sure you're okay?

598
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,730

614
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,370
It was an intruder.

615
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,430
He comes in and hit
him on the head.

616
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,320
and ran off.

617
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:51,180
Was this the same... intruder

You didn't see?

621
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:06,800

Maybe they were.

01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,440
Can't you say anything else?

712
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,540
Ah... okay...

713
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,550

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,220
Yeah...

715
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:11,700
Okay.

716
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,930
<i> If I could pull the
stars from the sky,</i>

717
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,620
<i> they'd be sitting in
your purse right now.</i>

718
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,100

- Hi!
- Nobody followed you, right?

723
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,420
No, nobody followed me

724
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,780
A cop came to
see me today

725
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:52,640
He was asking me all sort's of cuestions
about the eyes and the arm.

726
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,270
He says they were stolen,
were they?

727
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,600
I don't know.

728
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,770
- Maybe, i mean this guy that i know...
- I thought you've said that you knew them.

729
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,360
I just wanted to make you happy...

730
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,210
I'll do anything to make it up
to you, anything.

731
01:06:09,245 --> 01:06:10,912
No, no...

732
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:12,580
Anything...

733
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:16,780
No, Chep, you have

734
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,080
Just give me a chance please!

735
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,840
I can get anything you want
anything, no problem anything.

736
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,460
Tell me...

737
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:33,710

740
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,440
The police chief finds his son's finger
in a pickle jar.

741
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,070
And Peter wants to use a prosthetic.

742
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,840
Okay... which one?

743
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,455
Which one, what?

744
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:56,970
Which finger?

745
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,390
The index.

746
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,530
Okay, i'll get it no problem.

751
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,360
I just want you to know that even

I will do anything for you.

753
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,670
I know you will do
the same thing for me.

754
01:07:24,705 --> 01:07:27,600
<i> ... you and your
special disease ...</i>

755
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,960
<i> I'll do anything for you,
just like you would for me.</i>

756
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,790
<i>That's what's love

761
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,420
What?

762
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:51,540
You came back to the prop house
and we made love.

763
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:56,541
- I came to the prop house to get a prop,
and we had a wonderful time

764
01:07:56,575 --> 01:07:58,980
but that never happened.

765
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,600
It happened!

766
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,210
Oh my god!

767
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,350
Please just go home, okay?

768
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,490
Go home and...

769
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,440
Go home and see that
this went to far.

770
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,170
And that i'm truly sorry!

771
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,230
Thank you Fran, i'm sorr...

773
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,800
<i>Do you know anything about a
pair of rhinoceros eyes...</i>

774
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:56,041
<i>...that were taken from the set of
Betty Bumcakes two days ago?</i>

775
01:08:56,075 --> 01:08:57,150
<i>No!</i>

776
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,050
<i>What about a strange
little fellow named Chep?</i>

777
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:03,070
<i>He works over at Bundy's prop house?</i>

778
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,995
<i>I've been there...</i>

779
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:10,900
<i>You visited him late
last evening.</i>

780
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,410
<i>You'd followed me?</i>

781
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:17,150
<i>Wait, excuse me,
you followed me?</i>

782
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,010
<i>What is this movie about?</i>

783
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:25,640
<i>Crime, cops and robbers.</i>

784
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,200
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

785
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,340
<i>Peter!</i>

786
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,470
<i>Is.. is that...</i>

787
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,740
<i>Are we still one detective short?</i>

788
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,850
<i>Why?</i>

789
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,980
<i>Look...</i>

790
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:52,170
<i>A detective...</i>

791
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,450
<i>A real detective.</i>

792
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:56,870
<i>How do you do?</i>

793
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,130
<i>Are you Peter Morgan?</i>

794
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,610
<i>I love your pictures.
Musicals are my life.</i>

795
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,880
What are you doing here?

796
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,740
How did you get out?

797
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,980
How do we get out?
How'd you get out.

798
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,680
You still think there's a difference,
don't you?

799
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,380
You think you can hide it?!

800
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,720
- Shut up!
- Be careful you, Chep.

801
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,120
So listen to us, you're house is
back into the void, back into the dark.

802
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:45,930
You'll never feel the light of day,
for that matter you wont know how to get out.

803
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,470
- I hate you!
- Mmm then you hate your self.

804
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,500
and you must start,
She'll come back just like you want.

805
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,280
And you better have what she asked for,
ready and waiting.

806
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,720
You better have it there for her,
find it, and quick she won't wait long.

807
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,435
- You've heard what she said...
- She denies it.

808
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:13,120
She is the same as you, she needs you,
that's why she keeps coming back.

809
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,020
Get it!

810
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,740
<i>Jesuschrist!</i>

811
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,340
<i> One day, I'll show them all.</i>

812
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,120
<i>Got to get out of this hospital
this god forsaken hospital alive.</i>

813
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,410
Jesuschrist!

814
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,700
Scared me!

815
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,290
This isn't the kinda place you
use to see peolple standing up.

816
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,430
What are you doing in here?

817
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,690
Checking my patients.

818
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:34,930
Patients? They are not patients
anymore, they're dead.

819
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:36,450
- You're aware of that?.
- Yes.

820
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,740
What are you doing in here?

821
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,605
He was my patient.

822
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,370
Oh yeah? You don't look familiar,
what do you do?

823
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,600
I'm a doctor.

824
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:51,200
Look i don't know if you're a doctor,
or if he is your patient,

825
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:55,300
visiting hours are over but,

Thank you.

828
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:15,660
Oh, no problem... Doctor.

829

Uh a man in a mask.

That's a first.

You like this?

838
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:59,300
I know a romantic little place
just over there.

839
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,910
Let me help you daddy

You fucker!

844
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:03,470
There's no need to hide
behind a ridiculous mask.

845
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:09,570
We're not sure you're all quite there
cã mai eºti în apele tale, Chep.

846
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,385
But you'll be the
ultimate judge to that.

847
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,250
Friends are underway right now.

848
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,135
Moments from now she'll
walk through that door

849
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,990
Then you'll see yourself
for who you're really are

850
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:25,200
But you would see.
There's something special waiting for her.

851
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,940
In the back room.

852
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,500

853
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,300
something she'll truly love.

01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:38,440
Soon you'll be taking
your rightfull place.

It's time now you're
almost complete.

856
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:45,200
The final task is at hand.
