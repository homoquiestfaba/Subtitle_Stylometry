1
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,130
People tell me about my greatness

2
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,243
They want to know howl got here

3
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,243
As I look back on my life. there have
been so many twists and turns,

4
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,170
The people who celebrate me now can't

5
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,040
really understand where I come from

6
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,729
All I can remember is
that we were very poor

7
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,807
Our home was a small nipa hut

8
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,323
The roof and walls were made Of leaves
from a coconut tree

9
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,809
Our house stood there - where
the small coconut tree now stands

10
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,405
That was where our house was

11
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,563
That was before, now it's gone

12
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,602
SO QhaUS it...
it brings back memories

13
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,924
My mom £00k care of us
because my father wasn't around

14
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,602
All Of my siblings worked
and looked for jobs

15
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,729
so we could survive and eat

16
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,609
Sometimes we would go
days without eating

17
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,090
There! They started
to pull in the fishnets

18
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,727
At (he crack Of dawn, our mother
would wake us up to pray the rosary

19
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,562
We would pray to the Lord

20
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,440
"What kind of life will we have
when we grow up?"

21
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,842
We had nothing

22
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,530
Then we would look for work

23
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,568
<i>I</i> would go fishing

24
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,206
I spoke to the owner of a fishing net
and asked if I could help

25
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,365
so I can have a share of the fish

26
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,283
At first, they were hesitant, because
I was too young, and what do I Know'?

27
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,002
They gave me a chance because I was
desperate and really needed (he job

28
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,965
And we needed to eat

29
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,044
Then I had a catch

30
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,648
I had a share of the fish,
and then I sold half.

31
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,647
Then I brought (he other half home
for us to eat

32
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,164
Manny was the first person <i>I</i> trained

33
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,965
Even without shoes, he jogged

34
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,441
And <i>I</i> saw in him, his passion

35
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,809
I also saw they didn't have money
to send him to school

36
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,048
That's why I trained him

37
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,849
These were the first gloves Manny used

38
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,447
when I started to teach him boxing

39
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,289
When he used them

40
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,761
he was only 12 years old

41
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,049
These are the memories

42
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,771
that he will never forget

43
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,681
n was Manny and I

44
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,806
The two of us looked for ways
to get out of poverty

45
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,360
I was really surprised
I received a letter saying,

46
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,647
"I'm already in Manila mom."
I cried

47
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,610
But Manny said. "if I asked for
permission to go to Manila

48
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,126
you will never permit <i>n</i> "

49
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,447
"I'm sorry mom but
I'm earning a living here

50
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,966
so we can get out of our poverty"

51
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,520
"My perseverance isn't just for me

52
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,250
this is for all of us"

53
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,641
I asked, are you boxing
there in Manila?

54
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,883
"Oh, we're here in Malabo mom

55
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,122
we live here at the gym"

56
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,891
I want (O greet my fellow men
in General Santos City

57
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,601
I wish you all well.
<i>I</i> know that you miss me

58
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,761
<i>I</i> already won here

59
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,922
I thank you for your support
and your prayers.

60
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,321
Because of you, <i>I</i> won by knockout

61
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,051
Thanks to all of you who supported me

62
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,600
Especial)!e my mom and
my girlfriend, Jinkee Jarnora

63
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,002
My mom. my dad. my siblings.
all my loved ones

64
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,811
To all my fans.
please don't lose hope

65
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,766
I was pregnant during his fight
in Antipolo.

66
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,164
That was my first experience
to see him fight

67
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,081
They wanted me to leave because

68
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,606
<i>I</i> was e months pregnant

69
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,805
At first, my uncle asked,

70
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,851
"How can a boxer be capable
of supporting you?"

71
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,766
But I thought it through carefully and
prayed to God

72
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,322
that he's really the one for me

73
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,729
After we got married. I went
to practice with him every day

74
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,523
<i>Good combination there by
Manny Pacquiao and a left</i>

75
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,762
Michael: Just make sure I
get (he money

76
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,002
You will get your money.
you have Bob's backing

77
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,445
Michael That's right

78
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,567
<i>men!</i>

79
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,365
<i>men Surrender new!</i>

80
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,208
<i>men!</i>

81
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,761
<i>men!</i>

82
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,001
<i>men!</i>

83
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,765
Of course, when you're famous,
many want a picture or autograph

84
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,002
but that's how it is

85
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,925
Because when you have fans it's also
important that you are nice to them

86
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,447
Of course we also know that
they are also instrumental

87
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,407
of course it's hard but

88
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,370
I'm able to manage

89
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,883
Really... this was the
hardest fight of my life

90
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,048
It can't always be like this

91
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,364
You know...
I've had many boxing fights, but

92
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,405
I didn't think
it would be this hard

93
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,164
NOW how in (he hell YOU beat
a guy at 150 pounds,

94
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,881
that can fight way better than the guy
you was fighting at 105 pounds')

95
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,644
n ain't no way possible

96
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,171
The allegation is

97
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,687
They're trying to ruin my. my.
my name in boxing

98
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,731
Of course there are a lot of things
you are obliged to do

99
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,691
But son-sometimes I wonder can I do this?
Can I really take this?

100
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,085
We wish you all the best of luck

101
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,969
against Juan Manuel Marquez
for the third time

102
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,491
Did you read the bill?

103
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,847
We can't go without Jinkee

104
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,043
Bob Arum: Be calm.
because <i>I</i> promise you

105
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,407
<i>I'll</i> bring the fight back in May

106
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,007
Bob Arurn: And we'll do it again.
We'll do it again!

107
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,362
He inspires the young DeoDle
because he came from nothing

108
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,408
He didn't have a name before

109
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:51,280
Then he became one of the biggest men
here in our country, in (he world

110
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,763
As long as he wants to fight again,
he can do both,

111
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,729
because he still has his potential

112
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,600
But he can also be used in the
ministry, because of his influence

113
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,291
Like what happened to me
in my last fight

114
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,928
<i>I</i> prayed <i>I</i> believed 100%

115
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,843
that <i>I</i> would win, <i>I</i> prayed

116
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,729
<i>But what happened m me')?</i>

117
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,961
You saw the result

118
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,930
But I was not sad

119
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,324
Because what is important to me
is my relationship with God

120
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,247
Before I could not resist the devil

121
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,322
When sexy ladies would pass

122
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,483
My eyes would follow them

123
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,161
But now that <i>I</i> have a strong spirit

124
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:51,723
I feed my spirit.
lam blind to other women

125
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,283
But the only and most beautiful woman
that <i>I</i> keep my eyes on is my wife

126
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:14,872
<i>,</i>
