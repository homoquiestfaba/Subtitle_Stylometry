1
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,017
What's happening right now
is important only in the context...

2
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,311
ofour continuing evolution
as a species.

3
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,731
Roger, all I'm saying is that I wish my
sister would learn to read a subway map.

4
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,942
By saying that, you disregard
the primary importance...

5
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,528
of utility in human relationships.

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,781
Our ability--
Men's ability to read maps...

7
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,324
to navigate, makes us useful.

8
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,327
You should discourage your sister
from even looking at a map.

9
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,498
Are you saying that we women
have an inferior sense ofdirection?

10
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,501
Which way is north,Joyce,
without looking around?

11
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,003
What?

12
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,005
You heard me. Point north.
Quick. North.

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,381
Quick. North.

14
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,008
North. North.

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,512
- You're right.
- Is he right?

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,347
- He's right.
- Very impressive.

17
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,600
As she has throughout history...

18
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:43,187
the female responds to the male
who displays the most utility.

19
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:46,148
By honing those skills
which make me useful...

20
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,568
I stave off
my inevitable obsolescence.

21
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,279
You stay home honing your ability
to program a VCR?

22
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,532
My VCR's been flashing 1 2:00
for three years.

23
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,744
What else, Roger?

24
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:02,789
Oh, driving a standard shift.
Lifting heavy things.

25
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,958
- Air guitar.
- Yes, yes.

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,877
Go ahead and chuckle, okay?

27
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,297
But until women evolve the ability
to move objects telepathically--

28
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,840
and they will--

29
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,092
physical strength
remains a primary utility.

30
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,053
Here's to brute strength then.

31
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,601
Roger, you're forgetting
a very important male utility.

32
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,977
What's that? Barbecuing?

33
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,232
Sex.

34
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,694
Yeah. I want a guy to do more
than just program my VCR.

35
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:36,740
Oh, I'll program your VCR, baby,
like you never had it.

36
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,076
It's a top-loader.
You thinkyou can handle that?

37
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,703
Interestingly, a group ofscientists
in England...

38
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,623
just announced their intention
to fertilize an egg...

39
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,708
without the use ofsperm cells.

40
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,711
I don't understand that.

41
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,799
Every cell in the human body
contains a copy ofthe genome pattern.

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,885
The only reason sperm cells
have all the fun is that up until now...

43
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,929
they were the only ones with access.

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,223
Within Christopher's lifetime,
artificial insemination...

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,810
will render sperm as useless
as an assembly line worker in Detroit.

46
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,272
Luckily, my accountant set up a golden
parachute for my sperm years ago.

47
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,524
In case they were downsized.

48
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,487
Just so you know, Roger,
you know that we women...

49
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,241
make love because we like it.

50
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,451
- Notjust to procreate.
- Yes.

51
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:25,455
- But are men absolutely necessary?
- I don't know that.

52
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,457
Think ofthe structure
ofthe female genitalia.

53
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,252
Wait. Wait.
Okay, got it.

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,922
What is the most sensitive part
ofthe vagina?

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,885
-I can't believe we've gotten into this.
-I thinkyou know this, Donovan.

56
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,930
It's the clitoris, first discovered
by Renaldus Columbus in 1 559.

57
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,307
He thought it was lndia.

58
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,477
Oh, no! No!

59
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,772
The crown ofthe clitoris
contains 8,000 nerve fibers.

60
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,775
It's a far great concentration
than in any part ofthe male body...

61
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,068
even our fingertips.

62
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,280
It is the most efficient,
pleasure-delivery system...

63
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,073
ever devised by nature.

64
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,783
Now, askyourself...

65
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,078
why didn't the clitoris end up
inside the vagina...

66
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,664
so that intercourse
would be naturally...

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,417
compellingly, constantly pleasurable
for a woman?

68
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,794
- I know the answer.
- Yes, Ms. Maynard.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,716
Because in primitive time,
women died ofchildbirth.

70
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,636
So for intercourse to be
too pleasurable...

71
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,347
wouldn't make sense
from a Darwinian standpoint.

72
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,433
- I'm impressed.
- Absolutely right.

73
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,645
- What does that tell us?
- Evolution is looking out for us girls?

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,522
- Exactly.
- That for women...

75
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:35,400
intercourse and sexual fulfillment
were never intended to intersect.

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,987
New technology
just makes it official.

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:44,034
Future generations ofwomen will evolve
clitorises-- "clitori, clitorati"--

78
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,410
"Clitorissimo."

79
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,835
that are larger, longer,
even more sensitive.

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,046
And a woman's ability, as well as
her desire to self-stimulate...

81
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,048
will increase exponentially...

82
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,509
as intercourse is robbed
of its procreative utility.

83
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,595
- I'm confused and frightened.
- You should be.

84
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,516
The species is not static.
We're in a constant state offlux.

85
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,602
Two genders has been
the default setting for one reason only:

86
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,021
So far it's been the only way
to propagate the race.

87
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,023
Is there any species
thatjust has one gender...

88
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,609
that doesn't have male\female?

89
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,152
Starfish, for one.

90
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,406
Next time I see a starfish,
I'm gonna tell him to go fuck himself.

91
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,450
Come on. You love it.

92
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,453
No, we don't.

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,707
So where are we headed?

94
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,917
Equality?
Equality, what is that?

95
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,962
Is that a principle of nature?

96
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,882
We all sit around
reading subway maps together.

97
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,092
No. Ofcourse not.
Natural selection.

98
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,761
Now that is a principle of nature.

99
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,389
Selection. Something has to lose.
Something has to be defeated...

100
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,808
in order for something else
to be selected.

101
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,894
So, what does this mean?

102
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,566
We have to take orders fromJoyce
for the rest of lives.

103
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,235
That's right. I like that.

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,155
It means that 1 0 or 1 5 generations
from now...

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,324
men will be reduced to servitude.

106
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,411
Technology and evolution
will have combined...

107
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,206
to exclude sperm from procreation...

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,251
and our final destiny will be
to lift couches...

109
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,671
and wait for that day
when telepathy overcomes gravity...

110
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:24,593
and our gender's last remaining utility
is lost forever.

111
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,969
Forever.

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,347
Oh, my God, Roger.

113
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,853
- What? I'm done.
- Then I rest my case.

114
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,984
Thankyou.

115
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,446
Love you people.

116
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,789
Yeah, this is good.

117
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,430
-Jesus!
- No, just me.

118
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,017
How did you get in here?

119
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,647
- Where did you get those?
- Copied them from yours.

120
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,568
- When?
- Last week when you sent me for bagels.

121
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,280
Give them to me.

122
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,824
Aren't you tired ofconstantly
having to buzz me in here?

123
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:14,536
See how your brain works? How does
once a week turn into "constantly"?

124
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,707
Actually, last week was two times,
including, I believe, Friday...

125
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:23,170
when you woke me out ofa dead, pleasant
sleep and demanded the use of my body.

126
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,464
- You could have said no.
- What? Are you kidding me?

127
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,174
That was a call to action.

128
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,551
I dressed in 30 seconds
like a volunteer fireman.

129
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,636
I was insane--

130
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,139
You should stop talking and listen
to me. I got something to say to you.

131
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,641
Oh, yeah?

132
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,977
- Words are my stock-in-trade,Joyce.
- I know.

133
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,855
You can'tjust
stop up the floodgate.

134
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,899
- Put that down.
- What?

135
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,069
- We need to stop this.
- Stop what?

136
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,905
God, I love watching you
in the bathroom.

137
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:54,451
You're like an athlete after the game,
scraping offthe war paint.

138
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,828
I meant, we need to stop
seeing each other.

139
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,539
Oh, really?

140
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,376
This whole thing was a bad idea.

141
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,587
Generally, I have good judgment,
but this time, right out the window.

142
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:09,049
This whole thing is a great idea.
Nobody knows about us.

143
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,385
We all go out, I sit there and...

144
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,178
you know, a few hours later...

145
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,264
I know I'm going to be
the traveling salesman...

146
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,724
and you're going to be
the lonely housewife.

147
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,688
I need you to be an adult about this.
No scenes.

148
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,983
Joyce, I am your boy.
I'm your thoroughbred.

149
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,694
Adult. Understand?

150
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,532
Forget about the keys, okay?
Just keep the keys with--

151
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:47,045
Tonight is our last night,
so let's make it a good one.

152
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,801
Good-bye sex is never good.

153
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,887
Next week, we'll have
"get back together" sex--

154
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,439
- Can I stay the night?
- Roger, no.

155
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,319
Right.

156
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,669
Hi. Can I have a Cosmo and
a Maker's Mark on the rocks? Thanks.

157
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,298
- Let's have a talk.
- I'm sorry. I'm with some people.

158
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:55,591
Let me guess.

159
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,761
You're relatively new at the company.

160
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,849
Maybe you moved to New York from
somewhere else. Somewhere friendly.

161
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,478
First you took pride in being alone.

162
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,356
Wanna make a name foryourself
in the big city.

163
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,068
After a while, you started thinking
how it might be nice to meet somebody.

164
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,864
Winter's not far off,
and it gets lonely sometimes.

165
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,492
Okay. And?

166
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,330
And so you develop a crush
on your supervisor...

167
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,667
even though the other women
in the office tell you...

168
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,794
"Keep clear. He's bad news."

169
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,255
- Why is he bad news?
- Because he's a player.

170
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,550
He's a guy who collects trophies.

171
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:41,303
Every woman who takes a job there
ends up in bed with him.

172
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,681
And ifyou give in to temptation...

173
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:48,185
you'll end up the punch line
to a sordid joke by the water cooler.

174
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,770
Am I hot or cold?

175
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,567
- It's a good story.
- It's a cliche.

176
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,653
So what do you do
when you're not reducing the world?

177
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,364
What's wrong with reduction,
boiling things down to their essence?

178
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,409
What's wrong with...
seeing what's really going on?

179
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,538
And what's really going on?
What's the big revelation?

180
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,249
Why should I tell you?

181
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,626
Telling you
isn't going to change anything.

182
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:17,172
For instance, I could tell you that
what you think ofas your personality...

183
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,133
is nothing but a collection
of Vanity Fairarticles.

184
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,596
I could tell you your choice
ofsexual partners this evening...

185
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,558
was decided months ago by some
account executive at Young & Rubicam.

186
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:30,853
I could tell you that
given a week to study your father...

187
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,105
and the ways
in which he ignores you...

188
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:36,567
I could come up with a schtick
you'd be helpless to resist. Helpless.

189
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,116
I could tell you all that, but what
would you do with the information?

190
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,702
Are there women
who fall for this stuff?

191
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,663
I'm telling the truth as I see it.

192
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,499
You wanna go fuckyour boss?
What business is it of mine.

193
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,174
He's not Daddy.
He'sjust a guy in a suit.

194
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,849
You feel compelled to contribute
to the pathetic...

195
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,894
heartbreaking predictability of it all,
by all means--

196
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

197
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,633
- You waiting for someone?
- Yeah, my fiance.

198
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,178
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks.

199
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,725
All right. Congratulations.

200
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,940
Is he a kind man,
your fiance?

201
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,025
Does he treat you with respect?

202
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,904
Not that it's any ofyour business,
but, yes, he does.

203
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:09,034
- That must make you nervous.
- Why would that make me nervous?

204
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,578
Oh, come on.

205
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,498
Look at the time.
Let's do the math together.

206
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,291
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,628
Let me guess, low self-esteem...

208
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:24,883
and premenopausal... concern
led you to pursue a series of--

209
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,136
semiabusive relationships?

210
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:32,641
But a recent dose oftherapy
has convinced you...

211
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,893
that inner-beauty
is what really matters, and...

212
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:41,984
you really deserve that perfect partner
who treats you with such respect.

213
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,027
Do you want me to call
the bartender?

214
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,071
Unless you're an idiot--
which I don't thinkyou are--

215
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,073
unless you're some kind
of pathetic, self-help junkie...

216
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,784
you and I know your guy's gonna
wake up one morning, and--

217
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,371
he's gonna look around,
figure out how old you are...

218
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:57,708
and what you're really like,
and that's the day he's gonna go out...

219
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,793
for a pack ofsmokes
and never come back.

220
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,337
By that time--
How you doing?

221
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,592
Ifshe doesn't see what's coming,
I fucking weep for her.

222
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,274
- Can I help you, sir?
- Hey. No, thanks. I'm good.

223
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,109
I said, "Can I help you, sir?"

224
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:29,823
- Where's that other guy? The--
- He's home sleeping.

225
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,702
Okay. Well, it's very important that
I seeJoyce Maynard right away, so--

226
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,455
Okay. I understand.
Why don't I just leave her a note?

227
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,751
It's important
that I see her in person.

228
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,420
That's not gonna work,
so why don't l...

229
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,881
call you a cab and you go home
and sleep it off?

230
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,091
Why don't you go fucking home?

231
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,844
Okay. You know what?
We don't understand each other.

232
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:54,806
I'm her boy. I'm her boy, okay?
Who are you? Who are you?

233
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,311
I am the man who's gonna call the police
ifyou don't get out of my lobby!

234
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,865
Roger, it's Susan.
It's Thursday, andl wantyou to call--

235
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,322
- Roger, pick up line two.
- Who is it?

236
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,408
-It's regarding the newcampaign.
-Which new campaign? Get a name, please.

237
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,997
- It's Susan.
- Tell her I'm out.

238
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,958
- Shesays it's important--
- Tell her I'm out.

239
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:55,302
Yeah. This is, like, surly.
That's like, "What is that?"

240
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,179
- And this is, like--
- You want surly?

241
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,473
-This is like '90s, adorable normal guy.
-I am that.

242
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,475
- That's your problem.
- That's your nightmare.

243
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,645
Hey, Roget.
You going toJoyce's tonight?

244
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,814
What?

245
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,652
- Didn't you get the E-mail?
- What E-mail?

246
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,073
About the party?

247
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,534
You going?

248
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,286
Joyce throws a party,
I don't ask questions. I just show up.

249
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,090
She's on a conference call.

250
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,843
Ted, there's someone
in my office.

251
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,053
- Bye, Ted.
- It's okay, Donna, you can--

252
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,056
- Bye, Donna.
- I'll call you back in five minutes.

253
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,977
"Five minutes"?
This is a five-minute situation?

254
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,770
Sit down.

255
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,897
I don't wish to sit down.
I wish to stand.

256
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,900
Did you try to get
into my building last night?

257
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,780
Why am I not invited tonight?
Everyone will be there except me.

258
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,907
What is that going to look like?

259
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,162
- Let's reestablish some boundaries.
- Let's not.

260
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,084
I'm your boss.
You work for me.

261
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,420
You write very good copy.

262
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,093
But I have a hundred resumes
on my files for guysjust like you.

263
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,929
But do those guys
do that thing that I do?

264
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,806
The thing that you like?

265
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:28,520
I have explained to you that I do not
wish to see you socially any longer.

266
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,739
Find a way to deal with it.

267
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,085
What's that supposed to do?

268
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,369
Nick?

269
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,456
Uncle Roger.
How's it going?

270
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,918
What are you doing here?

271
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,630
What? Oh.
I wanted to see where you work.

272
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,510
- Yes. No. What are you doing here?
- What?

273
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,304
- You mean here in New York here?
- Yes.

274
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,975
I had an interview at Columbia,
so Mom said I should lookyou up.

275
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,019
- Sit down.
- Okay.

276
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,021
That's what all the phone calls
were about.

277
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,440
- The phone calls?
- Yeah. Your mom's been calling me.

278
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:59,236
- Did you speak to her?
- We're playing phone tag.

279
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,488
She said you could
show me what you do here.

280
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,574
She did?

281
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,869
Well, there's not a whole lot
to show you, Nick.

282
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:10,247
Really? Like, what do you do all day?

283
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,291
What do I do all day?

284
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,961
I sit here and think ofways
to make people feel bad.

285
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,340
- I thought you wrote for commercials.
- I do...

286
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,427
but you can't sell a product
without first making people feel bad.

287
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,512
Why not?

288
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,184
Because it's a substitution game.

289
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,896
You have to remind them that they're
missing something from their lives.

290
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,856
Everyone's missing something, right?

291
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,900
- Well, yeah. I guess.
- Trust me.

292
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,527
And when they're feeling
sufficiently incomplete...

293
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,780
you convince them that your product is
the only thing that can fill the void.

294
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,158
So, instead oftaking steps
to deal with their lives...

295
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:49,995
instead ofworking to root out
the real reason for their misery...

296
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,998
they run out and buy
a stupid-looking pair ofcargo pants.

297
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:05,177
- So... is it fun?
- It can be.

298
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:08,055
Look, I actually was about
to call it a day.

299
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,140
That's cool.
We can go get something to eat.

300
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:16,396
- Fine. Let's get out of here.
- Great.

301
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,882
You gave me a scare. I thought you
were having a narcoleptic episode.

302
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:47,553
- What? When?
- Back at the office, you know?

303
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,557
That's standing meditation.
It calms me down. Thanks.

304
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,059
Why should you calm down?
You're a teenager. Thankyou.

305
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,144
My brain gets all sloppy
when I'm stressed...

306
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,897
so the meditation helps me focus
and block out the bad stuff.

307
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,775
- Bad stuff?
- Like fear and pain, you know?

308
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,571
It's a visualization. I picture
a blue triangle, and that's me.

309
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:09,324
I put all the other stuffoutside
the triangle in a red field. It works.

310
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,495
So, how's your folks?

311
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,628
- They got divorced.
- What?

312
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,755
Yeah. My dad moved out.

313
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:26,258
- You're kidding. When did this happen?
- A while ago.

314
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,760
I haven't seen you
since Grandma's funeral.

315
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,977
-Jesus, Nick. I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's no big deal.

316
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,563
I still talk to my dad.
He calls from the road.

317
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,190
How's your mom doing?

318
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,608
She's fine. You know.

319
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,987
- Surprised she didn't come with you.
- Maybe she was afraid to see you...

320
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,947
after what happened at the funeral.

321
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:52,117
That happened because
your grandfather's a king-size prick.

322
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,205
All right?

323
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,174
So when's your interview?

324
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,011
- It was today.
- How'd it go?

325
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,555
Fine, I guess. I did the interviews
'cause Mom wants me to.

326
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,391
- You're not interested in college?
- Why keep going to school...

327
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,977
when anything I need to find out about
I can look up myself?

328
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,855
Dad didn't go to college. By the time
he was my age, he was on the road.

329
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,233
- How is everything here?
- First-rate. Thanks.

330
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:31,156
But... the good thing about college
is you get to hang out a lot.

331
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,659
- It's good for the social skills.
- Yeah.

332
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:43,043
So... my mom says you're kind of,
you know, like a ladies' man.

333
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,380
- She said that?
- But she says it like it's a bad thing.

334
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:48,423
That sounds like her.

335
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,636
- Is it true?
- What about you? You have a girlfriend?

336
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,433
No. I mean, you know, not yet.

337
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:04,606
Look. I'm getting older, and there's
a lot ofstuffthat I wish I could--

338
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,531
There's a lot ofstuffthat I haven't--
There's certain things I need to--

339
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,575
Yeah. I thought you said
you could look that stuff up.

340
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,702
No. I mean, not this.

341
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:19,538
You don't understand. I need
someone who knows what to say--

342
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,374
I'm kidding you, Nick.
That's what college is for.

343
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:27,504
You find some football player who needs
tutoring, and he helps you get girls.

344
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,591
- You don't get it.
- I get it. I was 1 6 once, all right?

345
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,886
What are you going to do
ifyou don't go to college?

346
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,346
Design software.
Maybe work on simulation games.

347
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,891
That's right. You're the computer whiz.
There is money in that.

348
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,976
I already make money
setting up systems for people.

349
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,520
I'm working on a web page
for Granddad for his research.

350
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:46,106
What, the old man?
He's actually spending money?

351
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,482
Yeah, good money too.

352
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,902
It's funny, 'cause he yells
at his computer like it's a person.

353
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,070
He's always going,
"That bitch ate my file."

354
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:55,699
- Or, "She's playing hard to get."
- You spend a lot oftime there?

355
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:56,783
Yeah, nowadays.

356
00:26:56,867 --> 00:27:00,078
I go over after school, and he
comes over and eats dinner with us.

357
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:04,041
Wait a minute.
He eats dinner with you and Susan?

358
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:08,086
Sure. Since Grandma died,
there's no one taking care of him.

359
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,048
Even after they split up,
she went over every day to cook dinner.

360
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,801
I mean, every single day.
She was nuts.

361
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,433
Yeah, she was nuts.

362
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:26,730
So, Nick.

363
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,859
You need some help with the ladies?

364
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,490
All right. Here we go.
Get this straight.

365
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,786
Sex is everywhere, okay?
It is all around us.

366
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,830
It's not some distant destination.
It's not Everest.

367
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,459
It is right here.
You have to attune yourselfto it.

368
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,503
You have to bring yourself
into alignment.

369
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,505
You have to find
the zone, Nick. Okay?

370
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:55,217
Do that, and I promise you
a whole world will open up.

371
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:59,763
Look at me. I walk around
in a state oftotal receptivity.

372
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:03,141
- I'm like a fucking lightning rod.
- All right. Fine. What do I do?

373
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:07,437
For starters, let's get rid ofthat
little meditation. The blue triangle.

374
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:11,024
We don't block things out, Nicholas.
We let them in.

375
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,526
Let what in?

376
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,987
There are millions ofwomen
in this city.

377
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,282
Millions. Most ofthem are blessedly
unaware ofthe countless ways...

378
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,159
in which their bodies
are exposed to our eyes.

379
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,954
So, first, learn to read the sun,
where it sits.

380
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,751
You'll notice... correlation between
backlighting and transparency.

381
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,921
They wear light-colored clothing,
underwear shows right through.

382
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,966
Bra straps, panty lines.
No need to stretch or squint.

383
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:40,179
It is there for us, okay?
For example--

384
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:48,770
What?

385
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:51,356
Are you blowing my cover
like some construction worker?

386
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:54,484
- No. I wasjust--
- Use your head.

387
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:59,656
Step back. Let her pass.
Okay? Give it a few seconds.

388
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,118
Watch this, and then camouflage
the move. Pay attention.

389
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:10,042
Checking ofthe watch is good.
Or ofthe pager.

390
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,753
Or looking for
a street sign like you're lost.

391
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,380
You saw me do a combination.
Whatever it is, don't get caught.

392
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,175
Do you think women have a clue
what goes on up here?

393
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:21,845
What do they think,
it'sjust stock quotes, drill bit sizes?

394
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:24,640
They don't know shit!
Let's keep it that way.

395
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:28,477
- All right.
- Watch. What about your eyes?

396
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,188
- What? My eyes?
- Your eyes. How's your vision?

397
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,815
- No, it's good. It's 20-20.
- Okay. Peripheral?

398
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,652
- I don't know. It's fine, I guess.
- Fine's not gonna cut it.

399
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:40,280
You gotta workyour muscles like you're
training for the fucking Olympics.

400
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,116
- Yeah.
- Up, down, left, right, et cetera.

401
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,746
- Here. Follow my finger.
- Okay.

402
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,540
- Tell me when it's gone.
- All right.

403
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,793
- Okay. Stop.
- That's it?

404
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,003
You need a hundred,
a hundred and ten degrees...

405
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,339
before you're ready for the street.

406
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,424
I see behind me on a good day.

407
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,718
- You play video games?
- Sure.

408
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,679
Good. That stuff is training
for the eyes.

409
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:04,805
Registering images
in a split second.

410
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,015
It's invaluable.
Oh. Right there.

411
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,685
Blue sweater. Blue sweater.
Median. Blue sweater. Blue sweater.

412
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:16,316
That young ladyjust--
And you missed it.

413
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,443
- I know.
- In just a fraction ofa second.

414
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:22,281
That's all. But a trained eye
can get in there for a look.

415
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,908
You have to learn to anticipate
your opportunities, okay?

416
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,994
Getting out ofa cab,
wind from a subway grate...

417
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,206
or as you so sadly missed there,
bending over to pick something up.

418
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,209
These are situations which require
lightning reflexes.

419
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:37,671
- I tell you, I can do that.
- Your a step slow right now, Nick.

420
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:41,300
Hey, no wonder.
I remember what it's like out there.

421
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,885
No interaction. No face time.

422
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:46,138
Look at me. Every day I have
the street, the subway, the ATM line...

423
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:48,348
the office, the gym, the--

424
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,142
What have you got?

425
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,769
Young people sitting in cars in Ohio.

426
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,855
Wistful glances at the stoplight.

427
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,773
No, I go to school.
That's interaction.

428
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,483
Okay. Let's work with that.

429
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:00,986
The high school building
is four stories, if memory serves.

430
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,946
- It's five stories now.
- Whatever.

431
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,283
It's multistory, and that means stairs,
which is good.

432
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,828
Free yourselffrom the tyranny
ofeye level. Come here.

433
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,997
Use the angles.
High for cleavage.

434
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:17,127
- Low for the skirts.
- All right.

435
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:20,923
Remember, there's no shame
in calling on an old standby, right?

436
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:23,759
Dropping ofthe pencil. Tying of
the shoe.Just don't telegraph it.

437
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,386
What about reflective surfaces?
Mirrors, windows?

438
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,555
What, in school?
No, there's no mirrors.

439
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:31,099
What about that ugly
glass trophy case that--

440
00:31:31,225 --> 00:31:33,143
- Yeah, that's there.
- Well, use it. It's perfect.

441
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:36,563
Go stand over there for a second.
Keep going. Keep going. Stop.

442
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,276
Ifyou can't stare directly,
turn your back and use the glass.

443
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,569
Hi, gorgeous.

444
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:46,114
Remember, angle of incidence
equals angle of reflectives.

445
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,785
In other words, ifyou can see them,
they can see you. So be alert.

446
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,079
- This is really complicated.
- It's rocket science.

447
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,790
- You were smart to ask for help.
- I have a good one.

448
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,625
When they're wearing short sleeves...

449
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,795
and they raise their arms to fix their
hair, you can see in that gap there.

450
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,131
Now, see? That shows me
you're using your faculties.

451
00:32:03,215 --> 00:32:05,968
- Don't they know we can see in there?
- Ofcourse they do.

452
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,804
Breasts are very sensitive.
They know when they're exposed to air.

453
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:14,226
Are women gonna walk around with
their hands clamped to their sides? No.

454
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,478
Their hair has to be
dealt with eventually...

455
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:20,607
and it is ourjob,
it is our vocation to be ready.

456
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,278
All right. So all this looking is fine,
but how do you take the next step?

457
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,363
I need to meet someone.

458
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,786
Ifyou can't see
how the two things are related...

459
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,663
there's nothing I can do foryou.

460
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,124
- Wait. Relax. Come on.
- You think we are kidding around here?

461
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,418
- Do you think this is a joke?
- No. Why do you think I'm here?

462
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:43,213
- You have got to make sex a presence...
- I'm sorry.

463
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,257
- in your mind, in your life...
- All right.

464
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:47,176
- in your spirit.
- I'm sorry.

465
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:54,850
- All right.
- What? No. I don't smoke.

466
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,602
Better learn.

467
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,691
- Okay.
- Come on.

468
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,368
Here. Wait here.

469
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,765
Okay. Stay on this side of me.

470
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,356
Excuse us.

471
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,030
In, in, in.
Go, go, go. Hurry.

472
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,701
Oh, yeah.

473
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,123
Okay. We're in.

474
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,417
Good.

475
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,712
So, first, a survey ofthe terrain.

476
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,970
Technically, it's still happy hour.

477
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,349
Your casual drinkers have yet
to pack it in. Lots of groups.

478
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,602
Not exactly ideal for our purposes,
but not impossible.

479
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,272
So, we need to make an impression.

480
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:26,817
Send out a signal that back here
is the place to be.

481
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,319
All right. What do you do?
What do you say?

482
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:31,405
Who cares?
You're overcomplicating it.

483
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,324
You spend the whole night sitting here
thinking ofthe perfect line...

484
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,993
what good is that?

485
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:41,081
Just make contact. Separate yourself
from the rabble. Watch this.

486
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,588
Hey! Roses. Rosebud.

487
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,966
Hi. Come here.

488
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,885
Come here. Come here. Come here.

489
00:34:59,057 --> 00:35:02,728
Hi. Could you--

490
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,480
Could I get you to take a-- Yeah.

491
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,654
- Hey.
- Nick here thinks you're beautiful.

492
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:17,242
If he's got such good taste,
what's he doing hanging out with you?

493
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,828
Good question. Nick?

494
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:27,836
- Because he's my uncle?
- How awful foryou.

495
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,799
And so on.
No big deal, right?

496
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,552
Now she's aware ofour presence,
and we can plot our strategy.

497
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:39,056
I'm gonna get us some drinks.
While I'm there, think ofa hook.

498
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,602
- What? A hook?
- A hook. A line. An opening salvo.

499
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:47,689
Any minute now, Rosebud
is going to be standing right here...

500
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,275
Iooking down at you,
and you're going to have one chance...

501
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,071
to either hit it out ofthe park
or strike out miserably.

502
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,323
Be ready.

503
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,111
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

504
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,615
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

505
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:45,747
Hello, Nick. Your uncle says
you have something to tell me...

506
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:48,584
that will absolutely blow my mind.

507
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:54,298
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Those were his exact words.

508
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:58,552
Is he playing a littlejoke on us?

509
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,974
No, no. He's serious.

510
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,643
I mean, he's... totally serious.

511
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,605
- Tonight.
- Sorry.

512
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:14,985
Thanks. As I was--

513
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,070
- Tonight.
- Right, I was saying that...

514
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,657
I was saying that tonight is a--

515
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,410
Tonight is
a very important night for me.

516
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:26,163
I wasjust telling her
that we made a bet.

517
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:29,583
- A bet?
- Uh-huh. We made a bet for $1 ,000.

518
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,881
That I can get somebody to...

519
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,966
Iike, fall in love with me.

520
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,888
Really?

521
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:49,061
Love. That's a hard thing to verify,
don't you think?

522
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,563
No, I think we can do it.

523
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm confident we can.

524
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:56,527
A thousand dollars?

525
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,695
That's not exactly mind-blowing...

526
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,241
but it's not the worse line
I'll hear tonight.

527
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,327
What? Really?

528
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,789
Yeah. Good job, Nick.

529
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,625
- So, do we rate a sit-down?
- I'm waiting for a friend.

530
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,627
I'll run it by her
when she shows up.

531
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,421
Get her over here.
There's cash at stake.

532
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:20,342
Ifwe do, who sits with who?

533
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,886
Ladies' choice.
Natural selection.

534
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,270
I wanna sit with him.

535
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,899
Yes, yes.

536
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:49,955
What is this?

537
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,875
Rum and coke. I told him to mix it weak.
We got a long way to go here.

538
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,836
- Okay. I don't drink.
- You kidding me? Take a drink.

539
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,381
- I don't put alcohol into my body.
- You drink that drink.

540
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:04,261
Loss of inhibition is crucial
to your success tonight, okay?

541
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:07,139
Alcohol has been a social lubricant
for thousands ofyears.

542
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,684
You thinkyou're gonna sit here tonight
and reinvent the wheel? Please.

543
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:21,153
All right. Now, you did one
very good thing. You lied.

544
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:24,239
You made something up.
Keep that part ofyour brain working.

545
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:27,951
We get those girls over here, your first
instinct is gonna be to open up.

546
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,330
To tell the truth.
Fight it!Just keep it interesting.

547
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:34,875
Play up your novelty.
You're a 1 6-year-old in a bar.

548
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,879
Why? "My father owns the bar."
You got a month to live.

549
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,715
You're an actor researching--
I don't know. Improvise.

550
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:44,259
Next, check the time.
What time is it?

551
00:39:44,301 --> 00:39:45,969
It's about 7:02.

552
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:49,389
- Do you have a MedicAlert bracelet?
- No, it's instructions.

553
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:52,226
I'm having my body cryogenically frozen
if I die prematurely.

554
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,652
All right. Leave it.
It's spastic enough to be charming.

555
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,154
So, the time. 7:00.

556
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,783
We've got nine hours
until closing time. An eternity.

557
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,744
Look at me, Nick,
and answer me this question.

558
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,579
All right.

559
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,376
Who is the greatest basketball player
in the history ofthe game?

560
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,380
- Do you mean ever?
- Come on. This is easy.

561
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,675
- Michael Jordan?
- Michael Jordan.

562
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:27,052
Why was he the greatest?
Because he paced himself.

563
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,388
Because he always
had something left at the finish.

564
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:32,099
MagicJohnson called it "winning time."
See those guys over there?

565
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,397
Yeah. Those guys think
they're kicking ass.

566
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,274
Believe me, it is early.

567
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,526
We are a long way from winning time,
so pay attention.

568
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,695
- Okay.
- You say you want it.

569
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,405
Ifyou really wanted it...

570
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:51,034
you'd be in here, suffering the tortures
ofthe damned with those guys.

571
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,328
- What?
- There's a big difference between...

572
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,874
being horny and being willing
to put in the time night after night--

573
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,419
I want it. Okay? I go to high school.
You don't think that's torture?

574
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,713
This is a lot of information.

575
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm giving you
the keys to the kingdom.

576
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,216
Yeah, I know.

577
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,510
How many boys your age
get an opportunity like this?

578
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,595
Yes.

579
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,472
So, stickyour finger down your throat.
Drink ice water, call it gin--

580
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:16,185
I don't care what you do. Be ready
to dive in at the moment oftruth.

581
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:22,858
So... how often do you, like...

582
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,445
you know, like, get somebody
to go home with you?

583
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,824
Every night.

584
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:32,618
Bullshit.

585
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:35,370
Just because you're not having sex,
doesn't mean the rest of us...

586
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,289
are sitting around playing cribbage.

587
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,251
What's cribbage?

588
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,339
- What? What?
- Here we go. Here we go.

589
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,759
Here they come. This is so stupid.
They're, like, twice my age.

590
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:51,929
Champions refuse to lose.
Be like Mike.

591
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:54,598
Here we are. As promised.
For one drink.

592
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,186
- I'm Andrea, and this is Sophie.
- I'm Roger. This is my nephew, Nick.

593
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,605
- Hi.
- He really is, like, 1 6.

594
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,607
- I told you.
- Sit down.

595
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,692
How'd you get in here, Nick?

596
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:09,488
It's funny you should... ask me that.

597
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:13,659
'Cause we were, before,
discussing it, and--

598
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:15,911
Neveryou mind.

599
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,539
I'm enjoying the air of intrigue
Nick brings to our booth.

600
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:21,124
- Cheers, everyone.
- I told Sophie about your little bet.

601
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,793
She thinks you're full of it.

602
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,378
There's nothing little
about a thousand dollars.

603
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:27,130
He's got to get someone
to fall in love with him?

604
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:29,800
- A woman.
- A woman?

605
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,095
Does it have to be a woman?
What ifsome guy takes a shine to you?

606
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,099
I guess that would count, 'cause we
never discussed what gender--

607
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,978
If Nick is willing to exploit that
little loophole, he can have the money.

608
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,564
- What were you guys talking about?
- I don't know.

609
00:42:43,689 --> 00:42:47,609
- What were we talking about?
- We were talking about women.

610
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:51,238
Specifically, the pleasure to be derived
from admiring the female form.

611
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:55,409
Imagine what it feels like
to be admired all day long.

612
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:58,328
- Really.
- You'd rather be completely anonymous?

613
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,205
- Not completely anonymous.
- Not anonymous.

614
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,333
I myselfwould welcome the sensation
ofa hundred pair ofeyes...

615
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,878
caressing my... booty
as I walk down the street.

616
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,421
Guys always say that.

617
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:09,840
Yeah. "We'd love it ifwomen
were always staring."

618
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,091
We would.

619
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,303
You would love it if no woman ever
listened to a word you were saying...

620
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:18,140
and just kept her eyes locked on
your chest oryour crotch?

621
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:20,517
If it led to having sex all the time,
I would not mind.

622
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,687
You could deal with never being heard,
never being taken seriously?

623
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:26,815
If I had something that needed saying,
I would wait until right after sex.

624
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:31,653
Seriously, for a second,
just stop saying the obvious thing.

625
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,573
Think what it would be like
ifon every bus...

626
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:38,076
there were huge pictures
ofyour naked body.

627
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,330
- And on every billboard--
- Magazine.

628
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,665
That's right--
it wasjust about your body.

629
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,836
There was so much time and money and
energy spent obsessing and analyzing...

630
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,048
trying to get a glimpse ofyour body,
that soon it felt like...

631
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:53,091
the world had forgotten
about everything else...

632
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,260
and you end up feeling...

633
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:58,055
disconnected from your own body,
like it's not even yours.

634
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,726
Ifyou're really serious about
avoiding the male gaze--

635
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,313
- Ifthe goal is anonymity--
- I never said the goal was anonymity.

636
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,148
Here's a little suggestion, okay?

637
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,484
Putting on makeup.
Styling your hair.

638
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:14,613
Wearing a killer outfit and coming to
a place like this on a Friday night.

639
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,866
That's when it gets interesting,
because at a certain point...

640
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,786
- you start internalizing the male gaze.
- Not the best course ofaction.

641
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,413
Male gaze. Madison Avenue.
Fucking patriarchy.

642
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,457
Whatever it is,
it's done its number on you.

643
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,877
Do you thinkyou have any control
over who you find attractive?

644
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,713
- Ofcourse we do.
- I think not, and I'll prove it to you.

645
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:37,094
Ask any woman, "What's the single most
attractive quality a man can possess?"

646
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,638
- And what do they invariably answer?
- Sense of humor.

647
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,182
- Sense of humor.
- Sense of humor is huge. Definitely.

648
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:46,687
And yet, iftwo lean, mean,
play-by-their-own-rules...

649
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:51,358
motorcycle-riding men
strolled up to this booth...

650
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:55,320
and beat the shit out of us
two humorous guys, right...

651
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,657
and asked you out for a ride,
you would be weak at the knees.

652
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,118
- No way.
- Weak at the knees.

653
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:03,829
Well, actually, guys who ride cycles
are pretty sexy.

654
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:05,998
- Thankyou. You see?
- Sorry.

655
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:10,377
The fact is that touchy-feely, weepy,
in-touch-with-their-feelings guys...

656
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:12,421
make you sick--
you're repulsed by them.

657
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:15,132
Give me the lce Age, okay?
Survival ofthe fittest.

658
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,802
No mixed signals. No bullshit.

659
00:45:18,927 --> 00:45:22,181
Just the meanest, hairiest bastard
wins all the time.

660
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,057
Let's change the subject right now.

661
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:28,937
You know, it's interesting.
All this looking is so masculine.

662
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:31,732
I mean, you guys
arejust about the visuals.

663
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,568
Really. Why is it that when
I'm going down on a guy--

664
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,487
- Sophie!
- No, really.

665
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,907
Why is it
that when I'm doing my thing...

666
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:41,909
why is it that men
always insist on watching?

667
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:44,953
Why can't you just close your eyes
and concentrate on the feeling?

668
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,247
It's not the most flattering activity
for a woman.

669
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:50,042
I'm not sure that that's a--
Maybe we can help.

670
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:53,962
Nick, jump in here.
A woman is doing her thing.

671
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,216
Why do we have to watch?

672
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,680
Well, maybe to make sure
that it's actually happening?

673
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:07,226
I'll buy that.
Make sure we're not hallucinating.

674
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:11,063
And maybe to file it away, in case
it's a long time before the next one.

675
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,566
Two excellent answers. Perhaps you'd
elaborate on the filing it away part?

676
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,235
File it away for what?

677
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,572
- Oh. I don't know.
- Come on, Nick.

678
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,158
We're finally treading on
some familiar territory here.

679
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:26,620
Mom's in the kitchen
makingJell-O with fruit.

680
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,872
- You lockyourself in the bathroom--
- Don't sweat it, Nick.

681
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,874
I grew up with three brothers.

682
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,794
The closets were pornography museums.
More visuals.

683
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:36,630
You're right about the visual thing.

684
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:38,674
It always drives me nuts
when I hear a guy...

685
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:41,677
going on about something a girl does
that's supposed to be so sexy.

686
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:45,138
- Like what kind ofthing?
- Like how she flips her hair.

687
00:46:45,264 --> 00:46:47,558
How she stands with one foot
to the side. It could be anything.

688
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,060
- What's wrong with that?
- Because that's nothing.

689
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,020
That'sjust something she does.

690
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:55,148
And she probably only does it
because she saw it in a movie.

691
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:57,276
It's not their real stuff.

692
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,529
All that stuff-- the hair flips,
the mannerisms, the catch phrases.

693
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:04,366
They add up to the personality.
So they are what's real.

694
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:07,828
Yeah, but it's all the outside stuff.
That's fine in the beginning.

695
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:09,621
You need the outside stuff.

696
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,665
You need, like,
the reasons to be in love.

697
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,667
But you can get past that
to the part...

698
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,377
where the little tricks
don't mean anything.

699
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,589
I say you are attracted to
what is in front ofyou. End ofstory.

700
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:19,882
How romantic.

701
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,677
It takes years and years together.

702
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:25,512
- Yeah?
- I can't describe it exactly...

703
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,681
but it's like there's nothing
she can do.

704
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:30,726
All her usual ways of hooking you in
have no effect...

705
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,811
and yet you're still in love.

706
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,813
It's like the act is over...

707
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:36,857
and you get to the part
she's been hiding.

708
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:40,777
And she's been hiding it
because she thinks that's the part...

709
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:44,156
that's gonna blow it
or make you leave or get bored...

710
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:47,826
but you get to that part,
and you're still there.

711
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,413
And you're even more in love.

712
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,377
Wow.

713
00:47:57,503 --> 00:48:00,714
Have you met my nephew?
His name isJesus.

714
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,633
How old are you, Nick?

715
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,009
I'm 1 6.

716
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:07,638
Stay strong, Sophie. There's
a thousand of my dollars at stake here.

717
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:10,390
Are we still on a one-drink limit?

718
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:13,519
- I think we can have one more.
- Yeah, I'm in.

719
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,854
Great.
Scootch out ofthere, Sophie.

720
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:18,023
- Who wants what?
- Sophie knows what I like.

721
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,734
-Just some ice water, please.
- Okay, that's charming.

722
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:21,985
Nick?

723
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:25,989
A player might consider taking advantage
ofthis time alone with Andrea.

724
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:28,742
Andrea. Yeah.
You can take your time.

725
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:40,796
- Hi.
- Hey.

726
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:44,591
- What's the deal with your uncle?
- I don't know.

727
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:47,928
This is really the first time
I've hung out with him socially.

728
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:51,890
- Do you live in the city?
- I live in Ohio with my mom.

729
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,810
She and Roger
don't really speak anymore.

730
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:56,895
Ohio?

731
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,065
Do you have a girlfriend back home?

732
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,151
No. Not right now.

733
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:15,497
Nick, can you do me a favor?

734
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,082
Okay.

735
00:49:27,467 --> 00:49:29,219
Pick that up.

736
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:35,142
- Protein for stamina.
- Let's switch, Andrea.

737
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:37,811
- Okay. I suppose it's your turn.
- Yeah, good idea.

738
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:42,191
Keep things fresh
and help us fight that second-round lag.

739
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:44,902
- What's that?
- That's a conversational lag...

740
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:48,280
that often occurs after the ordering
ofthe second round.

741
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:52,075
Actually, Nick was telling me about you
and your relationship with his mother.

742
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,913
- No secret there. She's my sister.
- Your relationship with her.

743
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,999
Not your relationship to her.
Nick says they don't speak.

744
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:02,211
That's terrible.
I mean, you need your family.

745
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:05,506
- Yeah.
- What do you think happened, Nick?

746
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,801
My mom's a lot older than Roger.
Like nine years.

747
00:50:09,885 --> 00:50:12,221
You must have been quite
the little surprise, Roger.

748
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,973
A nine-year gap doesn't necessarily mean
an unplanned pregnancy.

749
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:19,478
But, apparently, I did come
as a bit ofa surprise.

750
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,563
Really? I didn't know that.

751
00:50:21,605 --> 00:50:24,024
That doesn't explain why you
and your sister don't get along.

752
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:26,818
Let'sjust say
we don't have much in common.

753
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:31,031
My mom says that when Roger was little,
he could talk himselfout ofanything.

754
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:33,242
He never got in trouble,
even when he got caught.

755
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:37,621
- She called him "Roger Dodger."
- That's perfect foryou.

756
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:41,041
There's nothing wrong with a high
verbal ability. Nick's got it too.

757
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:43,252
I wanna be like Granddad.
He almost never talks.

758
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,921
But when he does,
everyone kind of leans forward.

759
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,006
You know, my dad's like that.

760
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,676
The difference being that what
my father has to say is usually...

761
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,845
some variation on,
"Get me another scotch."

762
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,222
- Like father, like son?
- No, like daughter.

763
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:56,932
- I get my--
- Whose daughter?

764
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:59,560
- What do you mean, "Iike daughter?"
- Nojoke.

765
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:03,230
Mom keeps a bottle in the
laundry basket. She has foryears.

766
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:06,859
- Oh, God, Nick.
- That's awful.

767
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:10,654
She's not a wreck or anything.
She'sjust-- What do you call it?

768
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:12,698
- High-functioning.
- Yeah. That's Susan all right.

769
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,783
She's always functioned
at a high level.

770
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:18,662
- She'sjust really high, you know?
- How can you joke about that?

771
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:21,248
You can joke about anything
that has to do with yourself.

772
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,375
It's a basic human right.
Isn't that right, Nick?

773
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,379
I think that's constitutional
or something.

774
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:30,757
Freedom ofspeech.
Freedom tojoke.

775
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,135
You know what?
I need the ladies' room.

776
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,554
Let's let the boys discuss
these new revelations.

777
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,264
- Good idea.
- I don't-- All right.

778
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,807
All right.

779
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:43,020
Be careful.
We'll be waiting.

780
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,773
Are you sure you want
to get laid tonight?

781
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,483
I thought you would
like to know that.

782
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:50,485
I am not the one
who is here to learn.

783
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:52,487
For most of us,
this is a forgetting place.

784
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,406
- All right?
- We were talking about Granddad.

785
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:56,408
- I figured--
- You felt qualified tojump in...

786
00:51:56,533 --> 00:51:58,410
and expound
on that particular topic?

787
00:51:58,493 --> 00:51:59,953
That's right. I'm sorry.

788
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:03,081
You're an expert on that subject now.
You guys arejoined at the fucking hip.

789
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,125
I wanted to keep
the conversation going.

790
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,461
There are four of us
in this booth.

791
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:09,630
Think of it
as a game of bridge.

792
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:15,010
In bridge, you have
two sets of partners, okay?

793
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,012
Ifyou hope to become
the kind of man...

794
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:19,056
that other men
choose to go into battle with...

795
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,475
you have to learn
to read your partner.

796
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,561
It should have been obvious I don't want
to talk about the family tonight.

797
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:26,813
A little while ago...

798
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,775
we were listening to Sophie
describe herself giving a blowjob.

799
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,777
Don't you think that's
slightly more fertile ground...

800
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:34,488
than what's at the bottom
ofyour mother's laundry basket?

801
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,159
Pull your weight and steer
the conversation back...

802
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,745
to something
in the same universe as sex.

803
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:45,249
Remember, the thing that was supposed
to be the primary focus this evening?

804
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,084
Don't make me resort
to the fail-safe.

805
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,797
- Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

806
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,882
No. Bad idea.

807
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:55,384
Ah,Jesus.

808
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,624
Everything okay over there?

809
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,585
No. I can't go
with you standing there.

810
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,588
- Why not?
- I just can't. Get out of here.

811
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:35,382
Can't go through life
with a shy bladder, Nick.

812
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,467
You're gonna be spending
a lot oftime in bars.

813
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,511
Most ofthem will have restrooms
just like this one.

814
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,182
Fine. Then you go.
You go first.

815
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:46,268
I don't have to.
Just came in to rinse my hands.

816
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,354
Forget it.

817
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,737
- Let's go, kid.
- No, look. I'm with somebody.

818
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:00,365
Uncle Roger, could you
please tell him? He doesn't--

819
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:02,826
- How you doing?
- No, I don't know him.

820
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,828
- Bedtime, kid. Let's go.
- Uncle Roger.

821
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,872
- Come on, kid. Out.
- Could you please--

822
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:10,584
He's my-- Uncle Roger!
Really, go back in there.

823
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:14,004
Look, I'm an actor.
I'm researching a role.

824
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:16,089
- Good luck with that.
- Okay.

825
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,038
- You okay?
- Oh, hey.

826
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,124
I guess I should've waited
to use the bathroom.

827
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:54,878
Okay. Unless the novelty of hanging out
with prom king here has worn off...

828
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:57,673
I suggest we get a bottle
and find someplace with a view.

829
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:04,847
- All right. Let's find a view.
- Let's find a view. Ladies.

830
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,910
- That was close.
- That's good. Thankyou.

831
00:55:26,952 --> 00:55:29,204
- This is the finest.
- That's good.Just a little bit.

832
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,497
Thankyou.

833
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:33,166
Just a little. That's good.
That's good.

834
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:36,962
- How do you like the wine?
- I like it.

835
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:39,089
It makes my chest feel warm.

836
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,758
- Roger, you're a bad influence.
- Yes, I am.

837
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,303
- Alcohol, women of loose morals.
- And gambling.

838
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:45,846
That's right. Gambling.

839
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:48,182
I don't see Nick complaining.

840
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,517
Although I have to say,
for women of loose morals...

841
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:54,688
conversation has been
pretty tame so far tonight.

842
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:59,109
With the notable exception
ofSophie's oral presentation.

843
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,277
Shut up.

844
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,072
It'd be helpful for Nick to hear more of
the female perspective ofthe sex act.

845
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,283
- Do you agree?
- God.

846
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:08,744
Where to begin?

847
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,787
Nick will get us started. Nick?

848
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,710
Go ahead.

849
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,254
Ask away.
Any question you like.

850
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:20,631
Keep it interesting.

851
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,007
All right.

852
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,471
I guess I'd like to know
what your first time was like.

853
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,933
- That's what you come up with?
- That is a great question.

854
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,309
Thankyou.

855
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:35,145
I'll go first.

856
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:41,485
- It was myjunioryear.
- High school or college?

857
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:44,446
High school.

858
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:47,366
His name was Bobby Rushton,
and we weren't even dating.

859
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,911
I just picked him out one day
and decided he was gonna be the one.

860
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,372
- Why did you pick him?
- Sense of humor?

861
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,251
Ha-ha. He was funny,
as I remember, but...

862
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:00,170
it was something more than that.

863
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:03,632
It was like this vibe.

864
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:05,676
I knew he would be nice.

865
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:09,346
He wasn't very popular, and I didn't
think he'd brag about me to his friends.

866
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:12,182
- That's halfthe fun.
- Well, he didn't.

867
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,268
He wasjust as nervous as I was.

868
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,521
Which is part ofthe reason
that I picked him...

869
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:20,899
because I think
I wanted to have some control.

870
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:23,986
- You know?
- You were his first as well then?

871
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:27,155
Yeah. In fact, I went with him
to go get the condoms.

872
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,324
We biked all the way across town...

873
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:31,910
because we were so afraid
someone might see us.

874
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,454
- We planned the thing for a month.
- I love this story.

875
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,750
- Yes.
- So, where did you, you know?

876
00:57:40,419 --> 00:57:42,921
It was in my house,
in my room.

877
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,716
My parents were away
for the weekend.

878
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:49,553
- Did you bleed?
- The usual. Not too bad.

879
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:51,597
Wait. So it hurts the first time?

880
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,726
Well, it really hurts...

881
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,229
that first second.

882
00:58:00,397 --> 00:58:03,192
And then after that,
it'sjust new.

883
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:07,362
You know? It's like this
new feeling foryour body.

884
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:08,864
So how was he?

885
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,160
- Matter ofseconds?
- No way! He kept going like a champ.

886
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:15,454
I had to ask him
to hurry up, actually.

887
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,872
- Ow!
- Yeah.

888
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:21,168
He did admit to masturbating like crazy
beforehand so he wouldn'tjust--

889
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,546
- Like he wasn't doing that already.
- No, he sounds like a nice guy.

890
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:26,924
- He sounds like a dream come true.
- He was a nice guy.

891
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,468
He's a cop now.
He's got four kids.

892
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:32,012
Early sex
is an absolute humiliation.

893
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:36,058
Oh. Speak foryourself.
My first time was wonderful.

894
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,851
Oh, yeah?

895
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,937
Let me take a wild guess.

896
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:43,315
- An older gentleman.
- Right you are.

897
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,900
- Married?
- Right again.

898
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,528
How old were you?

899
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,030
I was 1 9.
Freshman in college.

900
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:52,908
Guess you didn't spend a lot oftime
getting to know your roommates.

901
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:56,828
No. No, I don't even remember
what they look like.

902
00:58:57,955 --> 00:58:59,790
So what happened?

903
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:04,920
Well, believe it or not,
he ended up staying with his wife.

904
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,631
What are the odds?

905
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,716
What did you do when you realized
he wasn't going to leave her?

906
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,011
Well, Nick,
I got over it eventually...

907
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:15,097
and vowed
not to repeat the mistake.

908
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:18,225
- And how's that going?
- Some months are better than others.

909
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,810
- Uh-huh.
- Sophie--

910
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,145
- I didn't say anything.
- What can I do? They're all married.

911
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:24,356
I promised I would not be a nag.
It's okay.

912
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,775
You, hotshot.
Tell us about your first time.

913
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,532
Actually, I think Nick's story
is much more interesting. Nick?

914
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,869
- This I want to hear.
- Yeah.

915
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:41,248
Nicholas?

916
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:44,501
Well, this is hard to admit, but...

917
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,755
I've never had sex.

918
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:55,387
You're a virgin?

919
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:57,848
Yes.

920
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,938
That is so sexy.
Am I right?

921
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,982
- It's hot.
- Really?

922
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,734
- Yeah.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

923
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:11,361
- No. Never.
- Have you ever kissed a girl?

924
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:14,364
Yeah, a couple oftimes in junior high
playing truth or dare...

925
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:17,117
but they weren't like real kisses.

926
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:18,535
No tongue?

927
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:22,456
I guess, but more than that.
They werejust stiff.

928
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,458
Not like I imagined
that they should be.

929
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,835
Nick, come here for a second.

930
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:32,341
Oh, my God.

931
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,741
Now, don't fall in love with me
or anything, okay?

932
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,787
That wasjust to get you
through junioryear.

933
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,497
All right.

934
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,836
I couldn't resist
being your first kiss.

935
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,170
That's right.

936
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,549
Forever and ever,
you will be his first kiss.

937
01:01:14,424 --> 01:01:16,468
- Get away from me.
- Come on. For symmetry.

938
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:18,554
No, not a chance. Nick.

939
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,182
- How do you feel?
- My heart is beating really fast.

940
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,726
- He knowsjust what to say.
- Is he a good kisser?

941
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:27,646
Oh, he's gonna break some hearts.

942
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:30,190
How 'bout down below, Nick?

943
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:32,484
Any, you know,
vertical displacement?

944
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:35,237
Leave him alone.
How you doing, Casanova?

945
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,989
- I'm okay.
- Sure?

946
01:01:37,072 --> 01:01:38,740
- Yeah.
- Okay.

947
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:42,202
Look, I confess. I'm married.
I keep my ring in my wallet.

948
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:44,288
Even ifyou were married.

949
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,377
Yeah, yeah.

950
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:54,214
So, Nick.

951
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:57,551
Take a moment to file this away
for later. You understand what I mean?

952
01:01:58,844 --> 01:01:59,928
Just think, Sophie.

953
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:04,224
In the next six months, every time
Nickjerks off, he'll be picturing you.

954
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,185
- Don't be an asshole.
- I don't do that, okay?

955
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,729
It's true.
Okay, so I'm not married.

956
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,898
What's important is
the emotional unavailability, right?

957
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:12,983
- That's what you look for.
- I'm leaving.

958
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,696
And, Sophie, you've even provided
young Nicholas here...

959
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:20,824
with a particular image
to help structure his fantasy.

960
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,911
Fuckyou, Roger.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?

961
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:26,455
- He's staying with me.
- You can come with us.

962
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:30,250
He's with me. Unless you're finally
ready to do something constructive.

963
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,711
Like help Nick have an orgasm,
huh, Sophie?

964
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,923
- It's time to cut your uncle loose.
- You're disgusting. We're outta here.

965
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,549
- You take care.
- Andrea?

966
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,218
- Oh, disgusting.
- Fuckyou.

967
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:41,178
Ladies? l--

968
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,764
Was it something he said?

969
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,265
Asshole!

970
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:49,228
But no. Don't l--
Okay, here's your chance.

971
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:51,230
What are you talking about?
Why did you say that?

972
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:53,065
Good cop, bad cop.

973
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,609
I planted the seed.
Now go and close the deal, all right?

974
01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:57,694
- I can't go--
- You thinkyou'll get a better chance?

975
01:02:57,819 --> 01:03:00,072
Go, for Christ's sake,
and remember the primary objective.

976
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:01,698
Go, go, go!

977
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,419
Run, Nick, run.

978
01:03:22,302 --> 01:03:23,554
Sophie!

979
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:28,350
Hey, Sophie. I'm sorry.

980
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:31,770
Don't worry about it.
It's not your fault he's a jerk.

981
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:35,440
I know. I wish it didn't
have tojust end like this.

982
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,569
We're going now.

983
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,822
I suggest you
call offyour bet and go home.

984
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:44,700
The bet thing
wasjust bullshit, okay?

985
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:47,661
I know.

986
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,540
You take it easy, okay?

987
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:54,168
Look, I want us to--

988
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:58,213
Don't spoil the wonderful time
we had tonight.

989
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,757
You know?

990
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,016
This is to remember me by.

991
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:20,444
Take care, Nick.

992
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:22,487
We need more men like you.

993
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:50,098
Hey.

994
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,266
What happened?

995
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,185
What? Nothing happened.

996
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,187
So you're oh for one.

997
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:57,314
She wasn't gonna go for it.
I couldn't ask her.

998
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:00,108
- You gonna sleep with Sophie tonight?
- It was obvious. She was not--

999
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:03,028
Are you going to have sex
with Sophie tonight?

1000
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,700
- No.
- Then I repeat: you're oh for one.

1001
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:11,912
You need to learn how to finish.
Anyone can get halfway home.

1002
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:18,085
We're switching to plan B. Hey!

1003
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,548
I think a change ofvenue
will improve your luck.

1004
01:05:41,483 --> 01:05:43,527
Wait! Hold up! Stop!

1005
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:30,157
Do me a favor.
Stay here till we're inside.

1006
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:32,242
- So where we goin'?
- Finish up.

1007
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:38,290
- We're going to a party. Come on.
- Whose party is it?

1008
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:43,170
Fuck! Over here.
Over here.

1009
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,715
Look at this.
Beautiful glasswork.

1010
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:03,357
Whoa, whoa.

1011
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:08,570
Why we running?

1012
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:10,572
That doorman has
a hateful personality.

1013
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,408
Listen up. It's gonna be
a whole new dynamic up there.

1014
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:14,701
Stay focused.

1015
01:07:14,785 --> 01:07:17,412
Don't talk to any guys.
That's a definite rally-killer.

1016
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:20,290
Keep moving at all times.
No hiding in the bathroom.

1017
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,085
Here we are. Hey.

1018
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:28,715
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Chris. How are you?

1019
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:30,717
This is my nephew Nick.
Chris.

1020
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,928
- How are you?
- How ya doin'?

1021
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:41,061
Wait. Do you have
a bathroom I could use?

1022
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,105
- A what?
- A bathroom I could use?

1023
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:44,273
A what?

1024
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,192
I've been trying to shake
this woman all night.

1025
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:50,612
This is Donovan.

1026
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:53,156
I'm the only one here
that's my age.

1027
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:55,576
Where did you think we were going,
thejunior prom?

1028
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:58,412
I think I'm drunk.

1029
01:08:00,998 --> 01:08:02,124
Come here.

1030
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,171
Nick. Do you know
where we are?

1031
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:11,133
- I thinkyou said Greenwich Street.
- We're in winning time.

1032
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,552
- Okay. Winning time.
- Right. Okay?

1033
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:16,263
It's a little harder to recognize
than when you're in a bar...

1034
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,307
but the concept is the same.

1035
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:22,394
There's an incredible moment
that happens when a party...

1036
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:25,522
passes its apex, its peak.

1037
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:29,651
As if by magic,
suddenly every person in the room...

1038
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,737
is acutely aware ofthe time.

1039
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:34,990
It is at that moment
that the fear hits.

1040
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:39,077
- What fear?
- The fear ofthe empty apartment.

1041
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:41,330
Oh. Yeah.

1042
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:43,665
That is more
than most people can stand.

1043
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:47,836
Desperation creeps into the room
like a fog.

1044
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,756
Eyes begin
to search the crowd anxiously.

1045
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:54,218
Standards are drastically lowered.
I mean, it's palpable.

1046
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,262
- You know what I'm saying?
- Not really.

1047
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:03,977
What I'm saying is,
you have a real shot here, Nick.

1048
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:11,026
This is the moment
that separates a true champion.

1049
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,237
You remember the reason
you first asked for my help?

1050
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:15,280
The primary goal?

1051
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,366
- Yes.
- Then let me help you...

1052
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,284
to achieve it.

1053
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,298
All right. So.

1054
01:09:33,423 --> 01:09:36,385
We need to scope out
who the drinkers are.

1055
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,346
Every party needs a pace car,
a rabbit.

1056
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,559
Always look for the girls who are
two drinks ahead ofeverybody else.

1057
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:45,227
How do you do that?

1058
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,729
Listen for inappropriately loud
bursts of laughter...

1059
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,107
or scan the crowd
for somebody spilling a drink.

1060
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,902
Check the dance floor for somebody
working out oftheir zone.

1061
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,904
How about them?
They seem pretty drunk.

1062
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,410
Good afternoon.

1063
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:06,790
God, this is so embarrassing.
I don't know how this happened.

1064
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,626
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

1065
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:10,961
Hey, Donna.

1066
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:14,214
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

1067
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:15,924
- Well--
- Good. Listen.

1068
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:17,926
This is my nephew
I want to introduce. Nick.

1069
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,137
- Hi.
- I saw you earlier at the office.

1070
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:22,306
Hi, Nick. Donna.

1071
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:24,933
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

1072
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:29,479
- Roger's showing you the town?
- Yeah, some of it.

1073
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:31,899
Yeah, Nick's visiting.

1074
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:34,234
Why don't you tell Donna
about the bet we got going.

1075
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,986
- See you in a second.
- Huh? Wait.

1076
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:40,240
What bet?
What's he got you involved in?

1077
01:10:40,324 --> 01:10:42,784
- Oh, it's nothing. Really.
- What is this?

1078
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:44,786
Oh, that. I don't even know.

1079
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,246
- It's cute.
- Thanks.

1080
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,081
I don't even use it.

1081
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,626
Eighty. Hot. Eighty degrees.

1082
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,920
That is hot. Yeah.

1083
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:59,801
We made a bet whether I can get
someone to fall in love with me tonight.

1084
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,220
Wow.

1085
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,264
- For how much?
- A thousand bucks.

1086
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:07,559
Get outta here.

1087
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:11,021
Well, so, how's it going so far?

1088
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,983
Excuse me.
Thankyou.

1089
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:17,945
Thankyou. Cheers.

1090
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:19,196
Yeah.

1091
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,032
To love.

1092
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,464
Oh, hello.

1093
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:41,301
You're not the infamous Roger Swanson
I've heard so much about, are you?

1094
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,594
That's me. Yes.

1095
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,348
Joyce says ofall of her copy people,
you are the funniest.

1096
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,392
- I'm a laugh riot.
- No, she says that.

1097
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,769
- Why would I lie?
- What's your name?

1098
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,021
I'm sorry.
I haven't introduced myself.

1099
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:56,024
I'm Patricia.Joyce and I
went to college together.

1100
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,193
Nice to meet you.
Patty, would you do me a favor?

1101
01:11:58,277 --> 01:12:00,445
Sure. I can certainly try.

1102
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:03,490
See that kid right over there
in the corner?

1103
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,576
- Yeah.
- That's my nephew Nick.

1104
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:07,578
- Oh, really. He's so cute.
- He is.

1105
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:09,788
- He's still a virgin.
- No!

1106
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,457
- Swear to God.
- Poor boy. How old is he?

1107
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,001
He's 1 6. Now, listen.

1108
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:17,004
My time withJoyce taught me that
older women fuck likejackrabbits...

1109
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:20,090
and Nick is at
his absolute peak sexually.

1110
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:22,134
So, I figure,
the two ofyou go at it...

1111
01:12:22,217 --> 01:12:24,136
it would be
like Frazier and Ali.

1112
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:26,013
- Right?
- Something is wrong with you.

1113
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:28,891
No, I'm serious.
What do you say?

1114
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,144
- As a kind ofa...
- I'm gonna--

1115
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,062
Red Cross moment or--

1116
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,190
Okay. Nice to see you.

1117
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:56,668
- How's it goin' over here?
- Hey, Roger.

1118
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,838
- Now, who let you in?
- Who let me in? You let me in.

1119
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:01,298
What?

1120
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:04,384
You know, Nick here
is a real ladies' man.

1121
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:06,428
You're lucky he's spending
all this time with you.

1122
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,805
Yeah, that's me.
The lucky lady.

1123
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:14,436
Actually... I think
I had too much to drink.

1124
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:16,730
- Uh-oh.
- Would you like to lie down?

1125
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:19,024
Nick, Nick.
Excellent idea.

1126
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:21,818
Good one. Come on, darling.
Let's find you a place to lie down.

1127
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,820
Oh, no.Just when things
were getting good.

1128
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:25,864
Things are still good.

1129
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,538
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

1130
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:34,581
- We're going.
- We are?

1131
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:37,417
We're going right around
this little corner.

1132
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,503
- Here we go.
- I forgot to eat.

1133
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:46,677
Nick, stay with us.
Keep close.

1134
01:13:46,802 --> 01:13:48,262
- Okay.
- Good.

1135
01:13:48,303 --> 01:13:50,931
- All right. So I'll just--
- Oh, excellent.

1136
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:54,476
- Are you all right?
- I'll just leave you two together.

1137
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,061
- Okay.
- No, don't go.

1138
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:58,689
- You're in capable hands, believe me.
- What are you doing?

1139
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,274
Hang on a second.

1140
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:13,996
What are we gonna do?

1141
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:17,958
We are not gonna do anything...
at all.

1142
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,177
I'll be on guard duty, okay?

1143
01:14:30,053 --> 01:14:33,348
You need to work fast. If I were you,
I'd switch to the two-minute offense.

1144
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,684
What are you talking about?
Wait, Uncle Roger--

1145
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:37,394
Love you.

1146
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:42,858
Don't go.

1147
01:14:56,288 --> 01:14:57,748
Oh, let me introduce you.

1148
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:59,791
This is Donovan Lehman,
Christopher Weland...

1149
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,668
our two collaborators.

1150
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:03,670
I think they're gonna be
perfect foryou.

1151
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:06,882
You told me you wanted something
a little bit magic, a bit surreal.

1152
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:09,510
Hey, hey, Donovan.
How are you, man?

1153
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:11,970
- Roger. Hey, man.
- How are you?

1154
01:15:12,012 --> 01:15:13,347
Hey, Chris.

1155
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,849
Look at you two.

1156
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:19,269
You seem like the happy couple.
What's your secret?

1157
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,022
Sorry. You know what they say about
dipping the pen in the company ink.

1158
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:26,860
- I guess so.
- I know what they say. Yes, they do.

1159
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:30,405
All right.

1160
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,842
Look at you.

1161
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,186
Go to sleep.

1162
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,346
I think we got sidetracked there.

1163
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,682
Seriously, Donovan, with all
the pressure facing men today...

1164
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:45,809
it's got to be tough
to maintain a relationship.

1165
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:47,853
I don't know.
Let's ask a man. Chris?

1166
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:49,897
Traditional male roles
are being tossed aside...

1167
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,649
before we have any chance to make
an internal shift, don't you think?

1168
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:56,320
Our culture seems designed
to emasculate and infantilize.

1169
01:18:57,321 --> 01:18:59,489
- That's a strong statement.
- Why don't you go and...

1170
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,200
help yourselfto some food?

1171
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,660
It's particularly true
in a situation when the woman is...

1172
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:06,121
two decades older than the man.

1173
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,374
- Roger!
- Approximately.

1174
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,755
We were having
this discussion the other day--

1175
01:19:14,838 --> 01:19:17,341
Is it your mission in life
to humiliate yourself?

1176
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:19,510
It's more ofa hobby really.

1177
01:19:19,593 --> 01:19:21,637
I want you to leave right now.

1178
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:23,889
You want me to leave
and go where?

1179
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:27,643
Think very hard
about what you're doing.

1180
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:30,020
Go where,Joyce?
Where do you want me to go?

1181
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:34,399
You're through.

1182
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:36,860
You lied to me.
You are a liar.

1183
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,029
- I want you to leave.
- Who's he?

1184
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:40,906
Who the fuck is he?

1185
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:42,783
Who the fuck is he?

1186
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,868
Who is he? What--

1187
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,623
Don't get comfortable.

1188
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,127
Don't ever settle in
like you own the place. Trust me.

1189
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,840
There's always something
gaining on you.

1190
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:01,885
And here they come now.
Hey, guys. Good luck.

1191
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,804
Sorry. Take care now.

1192
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:08,058
Let me get a coat here.
Take care.

1193
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,561
Nice to see you.
Thanks,Joyce! Bye-bye!

1194
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:13,897
Whatjust happened?

1195
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:15,899
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1196
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:31,748
That didn't go
exactly as I had hoped.

1197
01:20:36,837 --> 01:20:39,047
What happened in there?
What were you shouting about?

1198
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:41,091
Doesn't matter.
What about you?

1199
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,093
- Did you get it on with Donna?
- No.

1200
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:46,054
- Why not?
- Are you kidding? She was passed out!

1201
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:51,059
Nick, you have had one golden
opportunity after another this evening.

1202
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,687
You haven't exactly shown yourself
to be a clutch player.

1203
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,772
- Hey!
- What happened in there?

1204
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:58,192
- Are you drunk?
- I'm going home.

1205
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,694
- Where do you need to be dropped?
- What?

1206
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,112
That's it?

1207
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:06,200
We've had a full evening.
I thinkyou're ready to fly solo.

1208
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:11,163
- You said there was a fail-safe.
- What fail-safe?

1209
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:14,208
Back at the bar.
You said there was a fail-safe.

1210
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,501
Did l?

1211
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:20,881
- I don't thinkyou want the fail-safe.
- No, I want it!Just stop.

1212
01:21:20,964 --> 01:21:22,674
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1213
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:25,135
I'm not going home like this,
all right?

1214
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:26,553
I'm sure. Okay?

1215
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:30,891
You know what? You're right.

1216
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:34,102
Why give into a slump?
Let's go down swinging.

1217
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:36,688
- Yes. Like Michael Jordan.
- Right.

1218
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:39,775
That's the wrong sport,
but I like your enthusiasm. Let's go.

1219
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:13,559
All right. Thanks.

1220
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:32,661
Come on. Come on.

1221
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:30,552
Hey. Two of us.

1222
01:23:30,677 --> 01:23:32,137
That's 200.

1223
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,602
One... two.

1224
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:43,774
- Is he a minor?
- I'm an actor. I'm researching a role.

1225
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,810
It's a hundred to fuck me.

1226
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,079
Tip.

1227
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:43,519
Come on.

1228
01:25:51,151 --> 01:25:53,237
Wait.Just slow down.

1229
01:25:56,782 --> 01:25:58,200
Please slow down.

1230
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:56,425
- We're goin' home.
- Hey! Hey!

1231
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,510
- What are you doing?
- Easy, easy.

1232
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:01,471
Get outta here.
Motherfucker, get off me!

1233
01:27:01,555 --> 01:27:04,224
Motherfucker, get off me!

1234
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:07,019
- Get off me!
- Get outta here!

1235
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:08,478
Nick!

1236
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:18,822
Nick.

1237
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:26,455
Nick, don't worry about it.

1238
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:36,215
It's okay. It's all right!

1239
01:27:39,718 --> 01:27:40,802
Nick!

1240
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:45,349
Chill!

1241
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:48,685
It's all right, man.

1242
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,063
Jesus.

1243
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,674
Fucking booze.

1244
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:30,018
Come on.

1245
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:15,856
Come here.

1246
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:19,026
-Jesus.
- Don't tell--

1247
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,611
Go to sleep.

1248
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:32,539
Okay.

1249
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:11,805
Roger, pick up thegoddamnphone.

1250
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:14,224
Nick isgone.
No one'sseen him in two days.

1251
01:31:14,349 --> 01:31:17,311
Iam frantic,
andlneedyou to callme, please.

1252
01:31:44,922 --> 01:31:46,507
Oh, my God.

1253
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:56,391
There's coffee.

1254
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:00,646
I don't drink caffeine.

1255
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:03,524
Yes.

1256
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:10,197
I keep losing my balance.

1257
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:13,116
- That'll pass.
- Yeah.

1258
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:16,912
So, Nick...

1259
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:19,540
tell me more about Columbia.

1260
01:32:19,665 --> 01:32:21,625
What did you think ofthe campus?

1261
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:26,922
I don't know.
It was fine.

1262
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:32,052
Did you...
Iook around the neighborhood?

1263
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:35,764
Maybe you could tell me about the
different things you saw on your tour.

1264
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:44,356
I'm sorry I got so mad.

1265
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,276
You're what?

1266
01:32:48,861 --> 01:32:50,237
Last night.

1267
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:56,118
You were trying to teach me
the way that things are done, and l--

1268
01:32:57,744 --> 01:33:00,664
I guess I kept fucking it up. So--

1269
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:03,041
So I shouldn't have gotten so mad.

1270
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:07,087
I'm... sorry I disappointed you.

1271
01:33:10,299 --> 01:33:11,842
Uh-huh. Okay.

1272
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:14,219
Anyone can have an off night.
It's happened to me.

1273
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:19,057
You said you score every night.

1274
01:33:19,141 --> 01:33:21,059
I say a lot ofthings.
Look, Nick.

1275
01:33:23,604 --> 01:33:25,480
Call your mom, will you?

1276
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:27,524
I'm sure she would like
to hear from you.

1277
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:30,319
Forget it.
I'll see her when I get home.

1278
01:33:30,402 --> 01:33:32,404
Call her anyway.
Come on.

1279
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:46,460
I'll leave you to it.

1280
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,180
I guess I'll see you
at the next funeral.

1281
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,515
Why? Who's sick?

1282
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:01,975
What? No, I'm kidding.

1283
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:03,268
Me too.

1284
01:34:06,355 --> 01:34:08,273
All right.
Good-bye, Uncle Roger.

1285
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:09,816
See you, Nick.

1286
01:34:18,408 --> 01:34:20,202
Don't tip. I got it.

1287
01:34:38,637 --> 01:34:41,306
How long does it usually take
to get to the airport?

1288
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:43,851
- About a half hour, sir.
- Right.

1289
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:02,054
You see Angela today?

1290
01:36:02,179 --> 01:36:04,181
- How come?
- No bra.

1291
01:36:07,726 --> 01:36:09,353
I swear to God.

1292
01:36:10,312 --> 01:36:13,232
That's unhealthy. They're gonna sag
when she gets older.

1293
01:36:13,315 --> 01:36:14,441
Fuck 'em up.

1294
01:36:14,566 --> 01:36:16,527
So go tell her, Nick.

1295
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,819
What?

1296
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:20,864
Go tell her.

1297
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:22,699
Yeah, maybe she doesn't know.

1298
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:25,536
- You know, you'd be doing her a favor.
- Yeah.

1299
01:36:25,619 --> 01:36:27,204
A true favor.

1300
01:36:27,329 --> 01:36:28,580
Yeah.

1301
01:36:57,985 --> 01:36:59,987
Look who dropped by
for a visit.

1302
01:37:03,782 --> 01:37:05,325
Girls.

1303
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:07,953
Young women.

1304
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:13,250
Female human beings.

1305
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:17,838
Female hearts
beating beneath...

1306
01:37:17,963 --> 01:37:19,673
those tight sweaters.

1307
01:37:19,798 --> 01:37:23,010
Feminine blood
coursing through their veins.

1308
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:26,763
Living, breathing girls.

1309
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:31,727
What are you young men in the
prime ofyour lives doing about this?

1310
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,520
I'm doing plenty.

1311
01:37:33,687 --> 01:37:35,689
- Yeah? You're getting plenty ofaction?
- Oh, yeah.

1312
01:37:35,772 --> 01:37:37,441
He has to beat 'em off
with a stick.

1313
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:42,321
Unfortunately, I'm not talking about
"whack-off.com," okay?

1314
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:45,115
I'm talking about
the girls in this room.

1315
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,242
I'm talking about communicating.

1316
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:48,952
I'm talking about engaging.

1317
01:37:49,077 --> 01:37:51,538
I'm talking about
standing up from this...

1318
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:57,336
guys-only, Star Trek-convention,
frankly, homoerotic little group...

1319
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:01,006
and introducing yourself
to one ofthese girls.

1320
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:03,008
Yeah, but I always get so nervous.

1321
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:05,385
Why? There's nothing at stake.

1322
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:07,596
Ifthere was a chance ofyou
actually getting laid...

1323
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:09,473
then you'd have
a reason to be nervous.

1324
01:38:09,556 --> 01:38:11,475
Try working someone in a bar
for three hours...

1325
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:14,686
and then you gotta close the deal
right before last call.

1326
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,730
That's pressure. Okay?

1327
01:38:17,648 --> 01:38:19,983
You guys can treat this
like it's a warm-up.

1328
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:23,862
You're trying to find your style.
So you get nervous?

1329
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:26,949
Maybe you're the nervous guy.
Maybe that's your hook.

1330
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:29,868
So go ahead and blush.
Stutter all you want.

1331
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,871
Show her
how she makes you feel.

1332
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:35,207
Think of it. You're combining
honesty and flattery.

1333
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,125
- That's lethal.
- Yeah, but...

1334
01:38:37,251 --> 01:38:39,711
you can't let a girl know
how nervous you are.

1335
01:38:39,795 --> 01:38:42,047
You gotta let her know
you're in control, right?

1336
01:38:44,091 --> 01:38:45,926
"In control"?
Who is this guy?

1337
01:38:46,009 --> 01:38:48,387
You're in high school. You don't
control any-- Look at your face.

1338
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:50,556
Look at what you're eating,
for Christ's sake.

1339
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:52,558
Look at that shirt.

1340
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:54,059
In control.

1341
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:56,603
All right.

1342
01:38:56,687 --> 01:38:58,647
Who's the one you guys
are all desperate to talk to?

1343
01:38:58,730 --> 01:38:59,773
Angela.

1344
01:39:00,816 --> 01:39:01,775
Definitely.

1345
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:06,864
- Angela.
- Okay. Here's what you could say.

1346
01:39:09,408 --> 01:39:11,577
Hi, Angela.
My name is-- What is it?

1347
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,662
- Darren.
- My name is Darren.

1348
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:19,251
Every time I see you in the hall,
I have the urge to talk to you.

1349
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:22,171
So I try to think
ofsomething clever to say...

1350
01:39:22,296 --> 01:39:24,506
but I get so nervous...

1351
01:39:26,425 --> 01:39:28,844
that nothing comes out.

1352
01:39:28,886 --> 01:39:32,097
We don't know each other right now,
but I'd like to maybe...

1353
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:35,851
invite you out for a soda sometime
so that we could talk.

1354
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:37,895
I'd like to see
what we have in common.

1355
01:39:38,896 --> 01:39:41,064
But most ofall,
I'm curious to find out...

1356
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:43,150
what kind of person
you really are...

1357
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:45,903
because I am tired
of looking at you from a dist--

1358
01:39:46,028 --> 01:39:47,946
And so on and so forth.

1359
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:49,948
Take that out for a spin.
See how it works.

1360
01:39:50,032 --> 01:39:52,534
Yeah. See her turn around
and walk back to thejock table.

1361
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:54,286
- Yeah.
- Ifthat happens...

1362
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:56,330
you go to sleep
knowing you gave it your best shot.

1363
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:58,332
Remember, she has to
show you something as well.

1364
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:01,460
I'd love it
ifAngela showed me something.

1365
01:40:02,836 --> 01:40:05,380
- Yeah. Two things.
- Yeah!

1366
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:08,258
I'd lick 'em.

1367
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:12,971
Well, I tried.
Hang in there, Nick.

1368
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:14,389
Wait. You're going?

1369
01:40:14,515 --> 01:40:17,017
Yeah, I gotta get home,
look for work.

1370
01:40:17,142 --> 01:40:19,061
As we speak,
consumers everywhere need reminding...

1371
01:40:19,144 --> 01:40:21,104
ofjust how fat
and unattractive they are.

1372
01:40:22,814 --> 01:40:24,775
Nice meeting you, men.

1373
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,110
Keep your sense of humor.

1374
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:31,281
In ten years, you won't even remember
what this place looks like. Trust me.

1375
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:37,871
Dude, your uncle is strange.

1376
01:40:38,664 --> 01:40:40,582
Yeah, I know.
I guess he is.

1377
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:42,543
Yeah, but he's cool.
You gonna visit him again?

1378
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:47,130
I don't know.

1379
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:52,469
What?

1380
01:40:55,889 --> 01:40:57,057
What?

1381
01:40:59,726 --> 01:41:01,186
Hey, Nick.

1382
01:41:01,353 --> 01:41:03,605
Some guy, I guess
he's your uncle...

1383
01:41:03,689 --> 01:41:05,941
he said you had
something to tell me.

1384
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:11,738
He said it would
"blow my mind."

1385
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:01,038
