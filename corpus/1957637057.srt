AND ALLEGED CROSS-DRESSER.

348
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,861
[chuckling]

349
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,231
- I TOLD BARRY AND HIS BOYS
I THOUGHT DIAMOND’S GAY.

350
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,899
- [chuckling] OH, NO.
IS HE?

351
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,801
- YEAH, MAN, I DON’T KNOW.

352
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,302
BUT YOU KNOW
I NEVER MISS A CHANCE

353
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,338
TO ABUSE
BARRY’S CHILDHOOD HERO.

354
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,440
- AND AARON TOOK OFF?

355
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,408
- NOT BEFORE THEY BUSTED UP
HIS DAD’S TRUCK.

356
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,247
- WHERE YOU GOIN’?

357
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,983
- HUNTIN’.
- WHERE?

358
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,620
- AH, DON’T DO IT, WALT.

359
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,221
- WHERE ARE YOU GOIN’?

360
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,893
- HUNTIN’.
[gasps]

361
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,662
- NO, YOU’RE NOT.
YOU’RE GONNA FIX
THAT DAMN WINDOW.

362
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,231
IT’S THE LAST TIME
YOU’RE TAKING THAT TRUCK OUT.

363
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,941
Y’ALL HAVE A GOOD TIME
LAST NIGHT?

364
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,649
I GUESS YOU
THEIR NEW WATER BOY.

365
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,317
IDIOT.

366
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,348
- WELL, PETER,
HE LOOKS AT THOSE TWO LINES

367
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,950
LEADING UP TO
THE PEARLY GATES.

368
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,085
NO...WAIT...

369
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,521
HE LOOKS AT THE ONE
ON THE LEFT--

370
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,657
NO, NOT NOW.
THE SHORT ONE.

371
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,394
AND, UM...
DAMN.

372
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,430
DAMNED IF I DIDN’T FORGET
THE ENDING.

373
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,666
- TEN CENTS OR LESS,
NO CREDIT.

374
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,000
- [laughs]

375
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,637
- YEAH.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

376
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,440
ANYWAY, IT WAS A HOOT.

377
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,375
YOU GIVE NOTICE
AT MARS HILL YET, DANNY?

378
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,145
- UM, NO.
NO, SIR, NOT OFFICIALLY.

379
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,615
- HE’S--HE'S WAITING
TO HEAR FROM WESTERN.

380
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,552
- I DIDN’T KNOW WESTERN
WAS INTERESTED.

381
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,487
- THAT’S GREAT, DANNY.

382
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,691
- YEAH...YEAH,
THEY’RE COMING DOWN THIS WEEK.

383
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,160
WESTERN. NOW, THAT’S TAKING
IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL.

384
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,961
- THAT’S A LONG WAY
FROM JEFFERSON CREEK,

385
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,397
ISN’T IT, DANNY?

386
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,833
- YES, MA’AM.

387
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,069
- WELL, GOOD LUCK.

388
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,870
EITHER WAY, YOU CAN COME
AND WORK FOR ME

389
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,172
AT THE MEAT HOUSE THIS SUMMER.

390
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,140
ALL THE PORK BELLY YOU CAN EAT.

391
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,718
- FEELIN’ BETTER?

392
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,120
YOU LOOK IT.

393
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,522
- I WAS...

394
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,991
TILL THAT THIRD HELPING
OF BAKED BEANS.

395
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,661
- THAT’S JUST THE WAY MY FAMILY
SHOWS THEIR AFFECTION.

396
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,962
THEY SHOVEL IT ON YOUR PLATE.

397
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,897
EACH YEAR,
THEIR UNCONDITIONAL LOVE

398
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,966
PUTS ME
IN A BRAND-NEW PAIR OF PANTS.

399
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,737
YOU BETTER WATCH IT, THOUGH,
ELWAY.

400
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,472
- YEAH.

401
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,210
- HEY, YOU KNOW CARRIE’S CRAZY
ABOUT YOU, MAN?

402
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,212
- I KNOW.

403
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,646
- BEYOND ME WHY.

404
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,750
GUESS YOU GOT YOUR MARKS.

405
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,652
COURSE, KIDNAPPING AND ASSAULT
WON’T HELP YOUR STANDING ANY.

406
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,190
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT IT.
YOU CAN’T DRIVE AROUND TOWN

407
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,659
WITH A MAN’S ASS
FOR A HOOD ORNAMENT

408
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,862
AND NOT EXPECT
PEOPLE TO NOTICE.

409
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,564
- COME ON, EMERSON.
WE WERE JUST PLAYING AROUND.

410
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,967
- YOU CAN’T DO
THAT SHIT, DANNY.

411
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,236
I KNOW JIM’S NOT
GONNA PRESS CHARGES,

412
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,472
BUT LEGALLY, HE COULD.
SHANE’S A LOOSE CANNON.

413
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,810
TAZ IS JUST AS BAD.
YOU GOT TO STEP IN SOMETIMES.

414
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,680
YOU THINK CARRIE’S UPSET
YOU’RE GOING OFF TO WESTERN?

415
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,083
TRY CRAGGY PENITENTIARY.

416
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:40,819
SHANE DID.

417
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,889
[phone ringing]

418
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,194
I’D HAVE PAID GOOD MONEY
TO SEEN IT, THOUGH.

419
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,734
JIM’S GONNA BE PICKIN' JUNE BUGS
OUT OF HIS BUTT FOR A WEEK, MAN.

420
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,171
[laughing]

421
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,641
- HONEY, IT’S THE STATION
ON THE TELEPHONE.

422
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,942
- JUST A SEC.

423
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,592
[screen door creaks]

424
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,763
DOMESTIC OUT ON ROSEMARY.
SOMEBODY’S ALREADY ON SCENE.

425
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,866
YOU WANT ONE?
- NO.

426
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,634
NOW, WHERE’D YOU SAY THAT WAS?

427
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:34,039
- ROSEMARY 315.
WHY?

428
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,609
- MAMA?

429
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,746
- YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND.
HE GETS CONFUSED EASY.

430
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,649
- YOU’RE HURT, MAMA.
- I’M FINE.

431
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,818
I JUST TOOK A FALL.

432
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,654
I HAD AN ACCIDENT, BABY,
AND NOW I GOT TO GO GET FIXED.

433
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,791
- WHY’D YOU GET HURT, MAMA?

434
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,259
WHERE?

435
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,695
- I HIT THE PORCH STAIRS
OUT BACK,

436
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,830
CLUMSY AS I AM.

437
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,800
I’M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, THOUGH.
THEY’RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME.

438
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,802
- YOUR MOTHER BROKE HER ARM,
AARON.

439
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,303
WE HAVE TO TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

440
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,705
- I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

441
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:07,806
- STAY HERE.

442
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,875
DADDY’LL BRING YOU OUT SOON.

443
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,010
HE’S COMING OUT SOON.

444
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,213
GO ON.

445
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,217
- IF WE WILL FOLLOW
THOSE COMMANDMENTS,

446
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,286
WE WILL RECEIVE THE GUARANTEE
OF LIFE EVERLASTING

447
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,721
AND LIFE ETERNAL.

448
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,160
"BUT IF YE, THROUGH THE SPIRIT,

449
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,296
"DO MORTIFY
THE DEEDS OF THE BODY,

450
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,998
"YE SHALL LIVE.

451
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,734
"FOR AS MANY AS ARE LED
BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD,

452
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,003
"THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD.

453
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,306
"THE SPIRIT ITSELF BEARETH
WITNESS WITH OUR SPIRIT,

454
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,208
"THAT WE ARE
THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

455
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,144
"AND IF CHILDREN,
THEN HEIRS,

456
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,246
HEIRS OF GOD,
AND JOINT-HEIRS..."

457
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,148
- YOU GET THAT WINDOW FIXED?

458
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,984
- YES, SIR.

459
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,186
MR. SIMMONS,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

460
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,256
DIDN’T CHARGE NOTHING
FOR THE GLASS.

461
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,194
YOU GONNA GO SEE MAMA?

462
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,197
- MAY RISE UP IN THE LAST DAY,
MAY RISE UP...

463
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,967
- WHY DON’T YOU COME OVER HERE
AND SIT DOWN, AARON.

464
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,169
COME ON, BOY.
HAVE A SEAT.

465
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,311
YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME I SAY YOUR NAME,

466
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,347
I THINK OF
YOUR DAMN JEW UNCLE.

467
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,051
THE MAN OWNS TWO CAR LOTS
AND HALF A STOCK CAR TEAM

468
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,752
AND HIS KIDS ARE STILL
ALL FUCKED UP.

469
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,354
HIS WIFE’S GETTIN' IT
EVERY WEEKEND

470
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,958
FROM SOME IDIOT
DOWN AT THE LOCAL VIDEO STORE.

471
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,927
I DON’T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT...

472
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,198
IT ALL GOES BACK TO YOUR MAMA
NOT WANTING TO LISTEN.

473
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,068
SEE, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,
I TOLD HER, I SAYS,

474
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,303
"I DON’T CARE WHAT YOUR FAMILY
TAKES FOR THE GOSPEL.

475
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,974
"WE’VE GOT TO GIVE OUR SON
A NAME FROM THE GOOD BOOK.

476
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:53,044
"OTHERWISE,
HE COULD TURN OUT INFIRM...

477
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,146
OR WORSE."

478
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,781
SO WHEN YOU CAME OUT

479
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,117
AND YOU WERE NO BIGGER
THAN A LITTLE BABY PUP,

480
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,987
I SAT IN THAT HOSPITAL
FOR FIVE WEEKS,

481
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,956
WAITING FOR YOU TO BREATHE
ON YOUR OWN,

482
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,829
WONDERING WHY THE GOOD LORD
EVEN BOTHERED SENDING YOU.

483
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,263
LOOK AT ME, BOY.

484
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,100
COME ON, LOOK AT ME.

485
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,203
NOW, IF I WAS EVER GONNA
LOSE RELIGION, IT WAS THEN.

486
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,938
BUT I DIDN’T.

487
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,108
I WENT BACK TO THE SCRIPTURE,
AND I LEARNED.

488
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,945
I LEARNED THAT HIS WILL
WORKS THROUGH ME.

489
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,881
SO WHEN YOUR MAMA
QUESTIONS MY WORD,

490
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:34,953
SHE’S QUESTIONING
THE WORD OF GOD.

491
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,789
SEE, I BROUGHT YOU
INTO THIS WORLD,

492
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,258
AND I ALLOWED YOU
TO STAY HERE,

493
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:45,030
EVEN THOUGH
I THOUGHT DIFFERENT.

494
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,332
AND I WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER THAT.

495
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,034
IF YOU EVER THINK
TO TELL PEOPLE

496
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,370
ABOUT THE GOOD CHRISTIAN WAYS
OF THIS HOUSEHOLD...

497
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,039
[sighs]

498
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,148
DON’T YOU CRY HERE, BOY.
I’LL HAVE NONE OF THAT.

499
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,850
YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM
IF YOU’RE GONNA CRY.

500
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,294
- I THINK
WE SHOULD GO SEE MAMA.

501
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:21,099
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
MATTHEW 15:4.

502
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,004
- TO LOVE THE LORD,
JESUS CHRIST,

503
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,039
IN OUR VERY HEART,
IN OUR VERY MIND,

504
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,508
OUR VERY SOUL,
TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOUL.

505
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,045
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, ON A...

506
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,817
- "...JESUS SCRIBES
AND PHARISEES

507
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,220
"WHICH WERE OF JERUSALEM
SAYING,

508
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:47,125

00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,715
- I SAID A GOOD MAN’S WORD
IS AS SURE AS HIS NAME.

686
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,685
- WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?
- YOU SHOULD KNOW
AFTER YESTERDAY.

687
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,921
YOU’RE JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.
YOU LISTEN BUT YOU DON’T HEAR.

688
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,224
- WELL, DAD DID ALL RIGHT.
HE GOT OUT OF THIS TOWN.

689
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,761
- THAT HE DID. AND LEFT
YOUR MAMA A MOUTH TO FEED.

690
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,098
- LOOK, THE MAN GOT A LOT
OF SWEAT OUTTA ME, MAN.

691
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,701
I WORK AS HARD AS HIS TWO
RANCH HICKS PUT TOGETHER.

692
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,237
I JUST EXPECT WHAT’S FAIR,
THAT’S ALL.

693
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,806
I’M SURE HE BEEN
PAYIN’ THE OTHERS.

694
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,809
- YOU CAN’T NEVER EXPECT
WHAT YOU CAN’T HAND TO YOURSELF.

695
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,245
AND FAIR AIN’T ALWAYS
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

696
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,747
LET IT GO, GIL.

697
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,983
I’LL TALK TO TAYLOR.

698
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,785
HE’LL COME IN NEXT WEEK
FOR SUPPLIES.

699
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,655
AND IT SEEMS THE PRICE
OF FENCE WIRE JUST SHOT UP

700
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,024
A FAIR PENNY.

701
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,994
NOW THAT, YOU CAN EXPECT.

702
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,264
ALL RIGHT?

703
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,147
- HOW YOU FEELIN’?

704
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,117
- KINDA FUNNY.

705
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,053
- YEAH. ME, TOO.

706
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:38,689
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO?

707
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,992
- YEAH.

708
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,261
- WE HAD A DEAL, RIGHT?

709
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,864
ONE LAST MISSION,
JUST LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT.

710
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,347
- AARON, WHERE’S DADDY?

711
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,386
- HE’S NOT COMIN'.

712
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,791
- OH.

713
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,129
WILL YOU GIVE THIS
TO HIM, SWEETIE?

714
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,132
THEY SAID I HAVE TO STAY
ONE MORE NIGHT.

715
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,737
- HE’S NOT COMIN' BACK.

716
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,708
- WHAT?

717
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,177
WHO’S NOT COMIN' BACK?

718
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,881
- HE’S GONE.

719
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,685
I MEAN, HE SAID SO,
AND THEN, HE JUST LEFT.

720
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,659
- THAT’S JUST NOT TRUE.

721
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,163
DON’T YOU TELL ME NO FIB,
NOW, AARON.

722
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,132
THAT’S JUST NOT TRUE.

723
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:59,770
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

724
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,106
YOU HEAR ME?

725
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,042
- I TOLD HIM
I DONE FIXED THE WINDOW.

726
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,479
- DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GONNA
TELL SOMEBODY...

727
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,214
ABOUT THIS?

728
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:14,184
DON’T YOU LIE TO ME, SON.

729
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,820
AARON!
- [stammering]

730
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,823
I TOLD HIM
WAS WE GONNA COME SEE YA.

731
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,361
- YOU SAID MORE THAN THAT,
YOU LITTLE SHIT.

732
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,303
WHEN’D HE LEAVE?

733
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,406
- LAST NIGHT.

734
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,481
MAMA.

735
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,851
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

736
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:52,022
HAVIN’ TO RAISE SOME HALF-WIT
WOULD MAKE ANY MAN TURN AND RUN.

737
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:59,329
YOU GO FIND HIM,
YOU HEAR?

738
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,299
YOU FIND HIM
AND BRING HIM BACK TO ME.

739
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,035
- BUT, MAMA, I CAN’T.

740
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,904
- ARE YOU TELLIN’ ME
WHY YOU CAN’T?

741
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,811
- EXCUSE ME.

742
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:18,082
I’M SORRY, BUT I BROUGHT
AARON OVER HERE,

743
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,551
AND I’M ALREADY LATE
TO MEET CARRIE.

744
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:24,955
- DANNY...

745
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,057
YOU HELP AARON
FIND MY HUSBAND.

746
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,529
I SEEN YOU WITH
SID COTSWOLD’S DAUGHTER.

747
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,765
YOU UNDERSTAND.

748
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,035
WALTER IS ALL I GOT.

749
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,474
- YOU REST NOW,
MRS. PERKINS.

750
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,844
I’LL DO WHAT I CAN.

751
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,113
COME ON, AARON.

752
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,092
MA’AM.

753
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,997
A FEW YEARS AGO,

754
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,033
SHANE AND I WALKED INTO
THE SCHOOL BATHROOM

755
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,603
ON THE WAY TO PRACTICE.

756
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:17,274
THERE WAS A FEW GUYS
LAUGHIN’ IN THE CORNER.

757
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:22,012
WE STEPPED UP A LITTLE CLOSER
TO SEE WHAT WAS SO FUNNY.

758
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,048
THERE WAS THIS SKINNY KID

759
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:28,418
STANDIN’ UP AGAINST
A WALL.

760
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,321
HIS LIPS WERE ALL
SWOLLEN OUT

761
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,990
LIKE TWO GRUB WORMS.

762
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,927
HIS FACE WAS STREAKED
BY BLACK MARKER,

763
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,497
EXCEPT WHERE HE
CRIED OFF THE INK.

764
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,867
BEFORE I KNEW IT, SHANE HAD
ONE OF THOSE FELLAS

765
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,905
CHIN-DOWN ON THE SINK,
SPITTIN’ TEETH AND BLOOD.

766
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:52,242
EVERYONE WAS RUNNIN’
FOR THE DOOR.

767
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:56,180
SIX MONTHS LATER,
WHEN SHANE CAME OUT OF CRAGGY,

768
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,349
JEFFERSON HIGH
CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIM.

769
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,321
THAT WAS THE DAY I MET
YOUR SON, MRS. PERKINS.

770
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,456
THAT DAY IN THE BATHROOM.

771
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,929
NOW THOSE TWO FELLAS PUT HIM UP
TO THE BLACKFACE, I’M SURE.

772
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,199
THEY DIDN’T BUST UP
HIS LIPS.

773
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,370
SOMEBODY ELSE
ALREADY DONE THAT

774
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,406
BEFORE AARON
EVER GOT TO SCHOOL.

775
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:32,549
- LIKE I SAID,
I’LL DO WHAT I CAN.

776
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,229
[dog barking]

777
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,167
- YOU KNOW AARON’S SITUATION.

778
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,368
- JUST--I WAITED UP, IS ALL.

779
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,070
- MORNING, MR. CROW.

780
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,974
- YOU ENTITLED TO YOUR PAIN,
MR. SHEPHERD.

781
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,409
- YOU WIN THOSE BOOTS BACK YET?

782
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,246
- HEY, THIS IS
GROWN FOLKS’ BUSINESS.

783
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,715
- GUESS NOT. YOU KNOW,
YOU KEEP ON PLAYING CARDS

784
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,683
WITH THOSE FELLAS
DOWN IN CHEROKEE,

785
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,486
YOU’RE GONNA BE
STANDING HERE NAKED BEFORE LONG.

786
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,422
- IT CAN ONLY BE
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

787
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,492
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

788
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,728
HOW’S THE BOY'S MOTHER DOING?

789
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,963
- LIKE USUAL.

790
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,734
MAYBE WORSE.
- MM.

791
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:26,670
YOU SEEN GIL TODAY?
- GIL?

792
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,472
HE’S JUST ROLLIN' OUT OF BED
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

793
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,641
- WELL, NOT TODAY.
HE CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING

794
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,142
SAYING TAYLOR OWED HIM
SOME MONEY.

795
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,745
TOOK MY TRUCK
WHEN I CAME INSIDE HERE.

796
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:39,182
I EXPECT HE WENT TO SETTLE UP.

797
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,319
SHEPHERD.
- NO, NO, I HAVEN’T SEEN HIM.

798
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,517
- Y’ALL TAKE CARE
OF THE TRUCK?

799
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,222
- PAINTER GORGE.

800
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,526

THROUGH THERE IN TEN YEARS.

THE RIGHT THING?

857
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,268
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

858
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,504
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED--

859
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,974
- THAT’S ENOUGH.
HIT THE SHOWERS. GO!

860
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,744
DANNY.

861
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,054
I KNOW YOU AND GIL ARE TIGHT,
AND I LIKE THE KID.

862
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,389
HE’S GOT HEART,
AND HE’S GOT ABILITY.

863
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,292
BUT WHATEVER HE’S DONE,
WHATEVER HAPPENS,

864
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:52,662
YOU STILL GOT A GAME TO PLAY
FRIDAY NIGHT.

865
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:56,533
DANNY, ALL EYES ARE GONNA BE
RIGHT HERE...

866
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,468
ON YOUR FUTURE.

867
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,873
OKAY?
GRAB A SHOWER.

868
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:11,514
- THEY’RE TREATIN' HIM LIKE
SOME KIND OF ANIMAL.

869
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:14,417
- HEY, DON’T COME IN MY OFFICE
UNTIL--HOLD ON.

870
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,953
JUST HOLD ON.

871
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,555
DANNY, IF I’D HAVE BEEN
DOWN THERE,

872
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,357
IT WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED
THAT WAY.

873
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,025
- WHY WEREN’T YOU DOWN THERE,
EMERSON?

874
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,327
- BECAUSE I WAS WITH THE VICTIM.
- THE VICTIM WAS ON THE FIELD.

875
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,696
- HEY, LISTEN. JOEL AND ED
HAVE GOT THEIR OWN WAY

876
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,098
OF DEALING WITH A SUSPECT.

877
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:30,634
AND IT’S A MORE
CONVENTIONAL WAY.

878
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,069
- YEAH, PERFECT
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE, I’M SURE.

879
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,638
- HEY, DANNY.

880
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,407
I GOT A DEAD MAN FOUND BURIED
IN HIS OWN BARN,

881
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,009
BEING CRAPPED ON
BY HIS OWN ANIMALS.

882
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,711
I GOT A RANCH HAND WHO EXCHANGED
STRONG WORDS WITH THE MAN

883
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,647
TWO DAYS BEFORE,
ACCORDING TO THREE SOURCES,

884
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,116
AND WHO RESISTED ARREST IN FRONT
OF FOUR DOZEN WITNESSES,

885
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,684
INCLUDING YOU.

886
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,686
NOW, YOU WANT TO ADD STINK
ON TOP OF SHIT?

887
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,755
I’M JUST GONNA TELL YOU,
WHAT YOU SAW TODAY

888
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,024
IS THE WAY IT’S DONE SOMETIMES.

889
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,529
YEAH.

890
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:13,610
- [sighs]
HOW’D TAYLOR DIE?

891
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:18,848
- LOOK LIKE SUFFOCATION.
MAN HAD A CLOSED SEPTUM.

892
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,518
HE CAN ONLY BREATHE
THROUGH HIS MOUTH.

893
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,753
NOW, WHOEVER KILLED HIM
MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH

894
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,121
TO KNOW THAT.

895
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,024
GIL’S GONNA GET HIMSELF
A LAWYER.

896
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:31,394
HE’S GONNA GET A FAIR TRIAL.

897
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:35,131
THEN THE TRUTH’S GONNA COME OUT.

898
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,434
- [sighs]

899
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,069
[dog barking]

900
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,642
- WHOA!

901
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,877
DUANE STINSON JUST ABOUT
DIDN’T COME DOWN ON THIS ONE.

902
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,746
[door rattles]

903
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,781
BOBBY TURELLI TOO FAR BACK
IN THE PACK.

904
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,583
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE DID
LAST YEAR,

905
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,785
TURNING IT ON TO WIN
IN THE FINAL LAP.

906
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:56,953
[TV clicks off]

907
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,456
- WELL?

908
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,424
- HE’S THE ONLY SUSPECT.

909
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,195
- THAT’S GOOD, RIGHT?

910
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,597
- WHY DON’T YOU ASK GIL THAT?

911
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:12,001
- I MEAN, AS LONG AS THEY THINK
THEY GOT THEIR MAN.

912
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,071
- IF WE’RE REALLY LUCKY,
IT’LL BE A SPEEDY TRIAL

913
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,040
AND THE TOWN’LL CONVICT
AN INNOCENT FRIEND.

914
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,075
SHORT STINT ON DEATH ROW,
AND HE’LL BE TOAST.

915
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,111
CASE CLOSED.

916
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,446
YOU’RE STARTIN' TO THINK
LIKE A FUCKIN’ CRIMINAL, TAZ.

917
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,015
- COME ON, MAN.
THAT’S WHAT WE ARE.

918
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,518
CRIMINALS.
ALL FOUR OF US.

919
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:32,822
LOOK, HEY, NONE OF US PLANNED
TO HAVE GIL TAKE THE RAP FOR US.

920
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,992
THAT’S THE WAY
IT IS, MAN, ALL RIGHT?

921
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,495
AT LEAST IT’LL
BUY US SOME TIME

922
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,430
IN THE SHORT RUN.

923
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,634
UNLESS EITHER OF Y’ALL
WANNA WALK INTO TOWN

924
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,004
AND TURN YOURSELVES IN, WHICH
I AIN’T GONNA LET YOU DO ANYWAY.

925
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:52,575
- Y’ALL SHOULDN'T DRINK
THEM THINGS SO MUCH.

926
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,011
MAKE YOU THINK ALL LOOPY.

927
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:58,715
YEAH, AARON. LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE LOOPY STORY

928
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,484
ABOUT THREE GUYS WHO DID
SOMETHING PRETTY FUCKIN’ STUPID

929
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:03,887
SO SOME KID DON’T HAVE TO
SPEND HIS LIFE IN A CUCKOO NEST

930
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,057
WATCHING CARTOONS WITH
JUMPER CABLES HOOKED UP
TO HIS SCROTUM.

931
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,028
- THAT’S CRAZY TALK, MAN.
- MAYBE IT IS.

932
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,531
MAYBE THIS WHOLE THING HAS ME
A LITTLE BIT ON EDGE.

933
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,933
HOW ABOUT YOU, AARON?
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

934
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,735
- FUCK THIS.

935
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,171
- WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU GOIN’?

936
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:29,145
- OH, MAN.
THIS IS GOOD.

937
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,147
THIS IS REAL GOOD, MAN.

938
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:34,050
LET’S JUST ALL GO AT IT
WITH EACH OTHER,

939
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,187
AND THE ONES LEFT STANDING
CAN BLAME IT ON THE OTHERS.

940
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,989
GOOD IDEA.

941
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,659
DEAD CAN’T TALK.

942
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,134
- I CAN’T STAND TRIAL
EITHER.

943
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,847
- DADDY SHOOTS BLACKBIRDS
SOMETIMES.

944
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,617
HE SAYS THEY’RE SPIES
FOR THE DEVIL.

945
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,720
THAT TRUE?

946
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,956
- I DON’T KNOW.

947
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,664
- I THINK THEY JUST COME AROUND
FOR THE HOLLY BERRIES.

948
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,570
- HE’D JUST SHOOT 'EM?

949
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,841
- AND IT MAKES HIM LAUGH.

950
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:36,880
THEN MAMA PICKS UP
THE FEATHERS.

951
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:43,186
WE SHOULD MAKE HIM
LAUGH, TOO.

952
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:49,826
I TRIED ONCE.
TOLD HIM KNOCK, KNOCK.

953
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,194
- DID HE LIKE IT?

954
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,902
- I THINK I TOLD IT WRONG.

955
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,310
- AARON...

956
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,914
HE’S NOT COMIN' BACK.

957
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,816
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

958
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:23,026
- DO YOU THINK THEM BLACKBIRDS
IS GONNA COME LOOKIN’ FOR ME,

959
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,131
’CAUSE OF WHAT I DONE?

960
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:32,201
- WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

961
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,675
YOU GOT ANY HOLLY BERRIES
FOR ’EM?

962
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,877
- NO.

963
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,682
- I GUESS NOT.

964
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,321
I WON’T LET 'EM
FIND YOU, AARON.

965
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,962
- DANNY, THAT RINGIN’
NEVER WENT AWAY.

966
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:01,798
- IT WILL.

967
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,318
- SHIT, CROW.

968
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,822
YOU EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE?

969
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,224
- WASN’T EXPECTING ANYONE.

970
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,427
A LOT OF FOLKS’ HEADSTONES
COULD READ JUST THAT.

971
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,797
PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO BLAME
IN A TOWN THIS SIZE.

972
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,400
CAN’T MUCH KEEP 'EM STILL
WHEN A NEIGHBOR TURNS UP DEAD,

973
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,436
EVEN ONE LIKE MORRIS TAYLOR.

974
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,139
- HOW’S GIL?

975
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,241
- HE STAYED SICK OFF OF
THAT CABBAGE THEY FEEDIN’ HIM,

976
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,244
BUT, UH...HE LOOKS GOOD.

977
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,879
YOU COULD’VE GONE TO SEE HIM.

978
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:51,314
- I WILL.

979
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,950
I JUST WANTED
TO TEST A THEORY FIRST.

980
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,486
YOU KNOW THAT DEBT SHEET
YOU HAD OUT THE OTHER DAY?

981
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,354
I SAW WALTER PERKINS’ NAME
ON IT.

982
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,323
YOU STILL HAVE IT?

983
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:02,191
TRUST ME, CROW.

984
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,293
THIS MAY HELP GIL.

985
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,303
- YOU KNOW,
WE ONLY PLAY FOR POINTS.

986
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,206
WHOEVER’S GOT THE MOST POINTS
AT THE END OF THE MONTH

987
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,410
GETS A STEAK DINNER
COMPLIMENTS OF THE LOSERS.

988
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,347
OF COURSE, SOME FOLKS TEND
TO GET SCARCE COME DINNERTIME.

989
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,283
- MAKES SENSE.

990
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:31,020
1,300 POINTS.
- MM-HMM.

991
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:35,024
- THAT’S A HELL OF A LOT
OF STEAK DINNERS.

992
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,226
YOU’RE NOT GONNA ERASE
TAYLOR’S NAME, ARE YOU?

993
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,796
OR WALTER’S?
- WHY WOULD I?

994
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,998
- NO, I JUST MEANT,
UNLESS YOU THINK

995
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,533
HE’S GONNA
PASS THROUGH AGAIN.

996
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:47,303
- DEATH IS A POOR EXCUSE
FOR A MAN NOT TO PAY HIS DUE.

997
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,039
COWARDICE IS WORSE.

998
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,376
AND YOUR THEORY?

999
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,812
- SHERIFF BRODY HAS
THE WRONG MAN.

1000
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,513
- WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

1001
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,316
- I THINK I COULD PROVE IT.

1002
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,518
- THIS IS A SMALL TOWN,
SHEPHERD.

1003
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,988
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE WATCHING YOU.

1004
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,390
REMEMBER THAT.

1005
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,238
- [speaking indistinctly]

1006
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,307
- HEY, EMERSON.
EMERSON, WE NEED TO TALK.

1007
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,109
- HEY.

1008
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,478
I GOT TEN MINUTES FOR LUNCH,
AND THE SPECIAL TAKES 15.

1009
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,947
- SO DON’T GET THE SPECIAL.

1010
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,015
- AREN’T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
IN SCHOOL?

1011
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,251
- I GOT A NOTE FROM MY MOMMY.
- DANNY...

1012
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,120
- SIGNED BY THE LORD HIMSELF.
THEY COULDN’T REFUSE.

1013
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,554
LISTEN, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

1014
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,523
NOW, I CAN’T BEGIN
TO EXPLAIN HERE,

1015
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,358
BUT THE PIT STOP
MAKES AN EGG SANDWICH

1016
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,360
IN TWO MINUTES FLAT.

1017
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,329
- NOTHING’S CHANGED.

1018
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,165
WE’RE COMPILING THE EVIDENCE.
WE’RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

1019
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:52,068
PERSONALLY, I’D LIKE
TO SEE US COME UP SHORT.

1020
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,437
BUT THE MAN DIDN’T BURY HIMSELF.
- I KNOW.

1021
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,039
I’M JUST ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER
SOMETHING, THAT’S ALL.

1022
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:58,474
NOW, I’M NO HARDY BOY,

1023
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,343
BUT I KNOW GIL BETTER
THAN Y’ALL DO.

1024
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,577
IF HE DID IT, THEN WHY?

1025
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:06,382
- HATE, REVENGE, MAYBE MONEY.

1026
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:08,951
MRS. TAYLOR SAID SHE SAW HIM
SNEAKING AROUND OUT THERE

1027
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,420
THE DAY AFTER
HE WALKED OFF HIS JOB.

1028
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,055
- YOU DON’T GO KILL SOME GUY

1029
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,557
JUST ’CAUSE HE STIFFED YOU
A FEW BUCKS.

1030
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,325
I MEAN, EVEN IF THAT GUY IS
A SPITEFUL BIGOT,

1031
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,394
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT
A FUTURE TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

1032
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,496
- I WOULDN’T, AND YOU WOULDN'T.

1033
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,399
BUT WHAT WE GOT ON GIL...

1034
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,536
MOTIVE, EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY,
NO ALIBI...

1035
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:30,072
THAT’S ALL PRETTY DAMN SOLID.
WE GOT NO ALTERNATE SCENARIO.

1036
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,175
- I DO.

1037
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,377
- OH, YOU DO?

1038
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,445
COME ON.

1039
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:42,118
- MORRIS TAYLOR OWED
WALTER PERKINS $1,300.

1040
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,487
WALTER PERKINS GOT
HIS OWN PROBLEMS,
HE SKIPS TOWN.

1041
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,256
BUT ON HIS WAY OUT, HE STOPS AT
TAYLOR’S RANCH TO COLLECT.

1042
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,425
AND HOW MANY FOLKS YOU KNOW

1043
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,527
GOT $1,300
LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE?

1044
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,496
TAYLOR DOESN’T.

1045
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:55,464
AND WE BOTH KNOW WALTER
AIN’T MUCH OF A SWEETHEART,

1046
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,234
SO THE OLD MAN
PAYS WITH HIS LIFE.

1047
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,137
TAYLOR WENT HUNTING ON WEEKENDS.
WALTER KNEW THAT.

1048
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,407
MRS. TAYLOR WOULDN’T HAVE EVEN
MISSED HER HUSBAND TILL MONDAY.

1049
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,509
- YOU...
- Y’ALL OKAY HERE?

1050
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,477
- CAN I HAVE
SOME MORE TEA, SWEET?

1051
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,146
- OKAY.

1052
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,181
- THOUGHT THAT UP
BY YOURSELF, HUH?

1053
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,919
WHERE’D THE DEBT COME FROM?

1054
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:20,156
- I CAN’T SAY.

1055
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,425
- WELL, IT AIN’T GONNA HOLD
A DROP OF PISS UNLESS YOU DO.

1056
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,427
- I WILL, BELIEVE ME.

1057
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,295
BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE.

1058
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:30,366
- ANYTHING’S POSSIBLE.
- OH, COME ON, EMERSON.

1059
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,535
- I’LL LOOK INTO IT.

1060
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,606
- THANKS.

1061
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,636
- BIT CHILLY, AIN’T IT,
MRS. PERKINS?

1062
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,638
- DON’T MIND NONE.

1063
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,140
- WELL, SOME DON’T.

1064
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:14,543
I’M EMERSON COTSWOLD, MA'AM.
I’M A DEPUTY TO SHERIFF BRODY.

1065
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,613
- I KNOW.
I KNOW YOUR MOTHER.

1066
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:21,284
- YEAH, I GUESS THAT’S RIGHT.

1067
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,587
WELL, I HATE TO COME TRAIPSING
OUT HERE LIKE THIS,

1068
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,491
BUT I’M WONDERING
WHERE I MIGHT FIND YOUR HUSBAND.

1069
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,761
- HE AIN’T HOME.

1070
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:34,430
- WELL, THAT’S
KIND OF THE THING.

1071
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,534
UH, HE OWES SOME FOLKS
SOME PROMISED WORK.

1072
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,004
AND A FEW OF THEM,
THEY’RE KIND OF ON ME.

1073
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,307
THEY’RE WONDERING
ABOUT THE SITUATION HERE.

1074
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,775
- WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEM

1075
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,410
THAT THEY CAN COME
AND GET THEIR CARS

1076
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,578
AND DRIVE THEM
STRAIGHT ON INTO HELL.

1077
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,781
SENDING YOU
TO SLAP MY WALTER’S WRIST

1078
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,717
LIKE SOME NANNY
ARM OF THE LAW.

1079
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,719
- IT AIN’T LIKE THAT, MA'AM.

1080
01:05:56,752 --> 01:06:00,289
THEY JUST NEED TO KNOW,
IS HE COMING HOME?

1081
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,660
- I EXPECT HIM SHORTLY.

1082
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,665
- WELL...

1083
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,635
OKAY, THEN.

1084
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:16,339
YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT ARM,
AND...

1085
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,208
YOU GIVE US A CALL
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

1086
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:35,658
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

1087
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,828
GATHER UP.

1088
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,496
[sighs]

1089
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,365
I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW,
YOU REMINDED ME

1090
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:46,535
OF MY WIFE’S BRIDGE CLUB
OUT THERE TODAY.

1091
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,471
AND THAT IS THE MOST
MEAN-SPIRITED

1092
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,539
BUNCH OF WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET!

1093
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,476
[laughter and cheering]

1094
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,444
GOOD WORK, GUYS.

1095
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,347
GIVE YOURSELF A HAND.

1096
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,382
DANNY.

1097
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:07,123
DANNY, THIS IS BUD GILES
AND JERRY CRAY FROM WCU.

1098
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,525
CAME DOWN TO SEE WHAT KIND
OF PROGRAM WE’RE RUNNING.

1099
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,360
- HELLO, DANNY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

1100
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,695
- LOOKS LIKE WE CAME
ON THE RIGHT WEEK.

1101
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:13,696
- I HOPE TO SAY.

1102
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,464
- YES, SIR.

1103
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,400
- DANNY, I’LL COME
STRAIGHT TO IT.

1104
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,768
I LIKE WHAT I SEE.

1105
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,536
- YES, WE DO.
- THAT’S RIGHT.

1106
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,639
SON, YOU GOT MORE THAN
POTENTIAL. YOU GOT TALENT.

1107
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,574
NOW, I DON’T SAY THAT OFTEN
TO FELLAS LIKE YOURSELF

1108
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:28,377
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TENDENCY
TO GET ALL STARRY-EYED...

1109
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,512
- YEAH, THEY TAKE THE FANCY.

1110
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,248
- THEN I GOT NO USE FOR ’EM.

1111
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,749
BUT I CAN TELL
YOU’RE DIFFERENT.

1112
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,451
THAT’S WHY WE CAME
TO EXTEND AN INVITATION

1113
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:38,354
FOR YOU TO COME SEE OUR CAMPUS,
MEET THE TEAM...

1114
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,523
- THE CHEERLEADERS.
- [laughter]

1115
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,892
- YOU KNOW, GET A FEEL
FOR WHAT WESTERN HAS TO OFFER,

1116
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,360
EXPENSES COVERED.

1117
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:48,597
- UM, WELL, I...
UM...

1118
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,332
- DON’T THINK TOO LONG.

1119
01:07:50,366 --> 01:07:53,202
- NO, NO, I MEAN, YEAH.

1120
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,439
OF COURSE, I--THAT SOUNDS--
I’D BE INTERESTED.

1121
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,573
- [laughs]

1122
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,241
WELL, HE’S INTERESTED.

1123
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,377
- WELL, GOOD.
GOOD.

1124
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,245
NOW, YOU TAKE IT TO ’EM
OUT THERE ON FRIDAY,

1125
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,613
AND WE’LL SEE YOU
AT THE VICTORY PARTY,

1126
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,383
GET THAT VISIT SET UP.

1127
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,386
- THANKS.
THANKS A LOT.

1128
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:16,392
HEY, UM...I COULD BRING
A FRIEND ALONG. GIL PARKER?

1129
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:19,195
HE WASN’T OUT THERE TODAY,
BUT...

1130
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,630
MAN, HE’S THE FASTEST BACK
THIS PART OF THE STATE.

1131
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,532
- YEAH, WE KNOW.

1132
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:28,704
- HOW ABOUT WE HAVE
JUST YOU UP, DANNY...

1133
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,439
FOR A START?

1134
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:33,576
I MEAN, MR. PARKER’S SITUATION,
IT’S...

1135
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,745
- IT’S PEPPERY.
- PEPPERY.

1136
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,482
YOU UNDERSTAND.

1137
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,283
- YEAH.

1138
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,718
- THAT’S ALL, SHEPHERD.

1139
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,587
GOOD WORK OUT THERE TODAY.

1140
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,225
- THAT’S A FINE BOY
YOU GOT THERE, COACH.

1141
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,428
- THAT ONE’S A PILLAR.

1142
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,563
[gate clangs]

1143
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,465

1144
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:05,374

[door slams]

1146
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,195
- GIL?

1147
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,931
- SHEPHERD?

1148
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:36,572
- YEAH.

1149
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:40,576
- DAMN, MAN, WHAT, YOU GET LOST
ON THE WAY OVER HERE?

1150
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,344
- [sighs]

1151
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:47,449
I DIDN’T KNOW
WHEN THEY’D LET ME COME VISIT.

1152
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,852
EMERSON KIND OF SNUCK ME
BY HERE TONIGHT.

1153
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,789
- ALL RIGHT.

1154
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,994
- HOW YOU DOIN’?

1155
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:03,332
- MAN, I GOT THE RUNS
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

1156
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,900
OTHER THAN THAT...

1157
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:13,642
- I’M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
EVERYTHING.

1158
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,778
- I AIN’T KILLED NOBODY.

1159
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,646
- I KNOW.

1160
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,882
- BUT THAT’S WHAT MOST FOLKS
THINK, THOUGH, RIGHT?

1161
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,620
HUH?

1162
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,289
[scoffs]

1163
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,358
THAT DON’T...THAT DON'T...

1164
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,927
THAT DON’T WORRY ME NONE,

1165
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,330
’CAUSE WHEN I GET BACK OUT THERE
ON THAT FIELD,

1166
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,065
THE ONLY THING THAT THEY’RE
GONNA BE THINKING IS,

1167
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,968
"MAN, THAT DUDE CAN FLY."

1168
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,803
- [chuckling]

1169
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:44,707
- WERE THOSE...

1170
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,409

1171
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,612

- YEAH, YEAH, THEY...

1175
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:03,592
THEY SAID YOU WERE
AS QUICK AS THEY’D SEEN.

1176
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,827
- FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

1177
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,762
- [chuckles]

1178
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:09,331
OH, MAN.
DAMN.

1179
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:12,034
DAMN.

1180
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:14,970
TOMORROW NIGHT IS IT,
AND I’M GONNA BE

1181
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,840
IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

1182
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:21,110
FUCK ALL THESE
SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS

1183
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,846
THEY JUST COME AND TURN
MY LIFE ON END

1184
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:25,514
LIKE THEY SERVE GOD’S HAND.

1185
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,049
THEY JUST THE DEVIL
OF A FUCKED-UP PAST.

1186
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,084
YOU KNOW THAT?

1187
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,953
AND THEY’RE ALL GONNA
DIE LIKE THAT

1188
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:32,855
WITHOUT KNOWIN’
ANY DIFFERENT.

1189
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,957
JUST SIMPLE MOTHERFUCKERS.

1190
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,792
- GIL.

1191
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,463
I WOULDN’T TALK TOO LOUD
ABOUT FOLKS DYIN’.

1192
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,501
ALL MY LIFE, MAN,
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT NOBODY.

1193
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,670
IT NEVER EVEN
CROSSED MY MIND TILL--

1194
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,905
TILL THEY PUT ME
IN THIS PLACE.

1195
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,614
- I’M GONNA MAKE YOU
A PROMISE, GIL,

1196
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:02,084
AND ONE I HAVE
THE POWER TO KEEP.

1197
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:06,121
YOU’LL BE OUT OF HERE SOON.

1198
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,589
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

1199
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,492
- SHEPHERD...

1200
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:11,894
I HOPE YOU’RE FOR REAL, MAN,

1201
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:16,465
’CAUSE I NEED
A PROMISE RIGHT NOW.

1202
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:18,667
I NEED SOMETHING.

1203
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,771
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF IN HERE.

1204
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,807
- ALL RIGHT.

1205
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,690
- GO ON AND GET THE REST,
WHAT’S ON THE LINE.

1206
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:46,662
AARON, DID YOU HEAR ME, SON?

1207
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,565
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN YOUR HANDS?

1208
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,033
- THEY WAS OUT.

1209
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,167
- NOTHING WAS OUT.

1210
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,969
THEY’RE YOUR MAMA'S.

1211
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:56,805
- LIKE YOUR SCHOOL PAPERS?

1212
01:12:56,839 --> 01:13:00,175
- NO, AARON,
THEY’RE FROM YOUR FATHER.

1213
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,111
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1214
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,047
- [sighs]

1215
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,783
THEY’RE FROM
A LONG TIME AGO, HONEY.

1216
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:13,088
YOU REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
DADDY WAS FAR AWAY THAT TIME--

1217
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,556
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN?

1218
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,592
I SHOWED YOU ON THE MAP.

1219
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:17,593
- WHEN HE WAS IN THE WAR.

1220
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,561
- THAT’S RIGHT.

1221
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,765
WELL, I COULDN’T TALK TO HIM
ON THE TELEPHONE

1222
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:26,034
A LOT OF THE TIME,
SO I WROTE DOWN LETTERS,

1223
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,970
AND I’D SEND THEM TO HIM,

1224
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:31,607
AND HE’D SEND ONES HE WROTE
BACK TO ME.

1225
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,711
AFTER I’D READ 'EM,
I’D PUT 'EM IN A COOKIE TIN

1226
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,113
SO THEY WOULDN’T GET LOST.

1227
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,582
THESE ARE THEM LETTERS.

1228
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,919
- HOW COME
THEY’RE KIND OF YELLOW?

1229
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,988
- IT’S 'CAUSE THEY’RE OLD.

1230
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,726
- AND--AND YOU KEEP ’EM STILL?

1231
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,127
- YES, I DO.

1232
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:55,597
THEY’RE PART OF MY LIFE.

1233
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:57,966
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WROTE
THAT NICE CARD FOR ME

1234
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,902
FOR MOTHER’S DAY.

1235
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:03,038
I KEPT THAT TOO.

1236
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,673
- AND DADDY BOUGHT IT.

1237
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,512
- YEAH.

1238
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,581
IT WAS REAL NICE.

1239
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:19,021
[sighs]

1240
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,758
AARON...

1241
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,060
I KNOW YOUR DADDY
HAS SOMETIMES SAID THINGS

1242
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:28,831
THAT...HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

1243
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:36,605
HE’S DONE STUFF TOO
THAT--THAT SEEMS MEAN, BUT...

1244
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:39,007
WHEN YOU GET RESTLESS,

1246
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,947
OR I TAKE YOU
TO SEE DR. HUSKINS.

1247
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,951
WELL, YOUR DADDY’S WORRIES

1248
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:57,192
WELL, THEY’RE JUST HARD FOR HIM
TO TALK ABOUT IS ALL.

1249
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:01,897
HE LOVES YOU VERY MUCH,

1250
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:05,300
WE BOTH DO.

1251
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,869
COME HERE.

1252
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,715
IT’LL GET BETTER.

1253
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,087
- HEY, RUSS.

1254
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,989
- GOOD MORNING.

1255
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,292
DISPATCH JUST GOT A CALL
FROM JACK CROW’S STORE.

1256
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:31,927
COUPLE OF CLIMBERS
FOUND A WRECKED TRUCK

1257
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,695
DOWN IN PAINTER GORGE.

1258
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,598
NO BODY.
- JUNK DROP?

1259
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,000
- DON’T THINK SO.

1260
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,202
THE REGISTRATION WAS
IN THE GLOVE BOX.

1261
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,604
IT’S WALT PERKINS' FORD.

1262
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,678
[tires skidding]

1263
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,213
- RIVER’S DOWN TODAY.

1264
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:53,715

1265
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:57,319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:03,058

THIS AIN’T ABOUT FISHIN', IS IT?

1267
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,174

1268
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,944
- WHERE’S AARON?

1269
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:24,012
HE’S PROBABLY OUTSIDE

1270
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,114

WHAT ARE YOU DOIN’

01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,021
COACH IS GONNA

1273
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,357
- SHANE, THEY
FOUND THE TRUCK.

1274
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,329
- SHIT.

1275
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,665
I’M SORRY, SWEETIE,
YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO GO, OKAY?

1276
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,033
GET DRESSED,
GET GOIN’.

1277
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,002
- I’LL CHECK
YOUR MOM’S PLACE.

1278
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,804
[dog barking]

1279
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,246
- MA’AM...

1280
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,850
- WALTER AIN’T HERE.

1281
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:05,287
- I KNOW.

1282
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,291
YOU MIND IF I COME IN
FOR A SECOND?

1283
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,193
- CAN I GET YOU
A DRINK OR SOMETHING?

1284
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:13,261
- I’M ALL RIGHT.

1285
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,297
- YOU’RE A GUEST IN MY HOME,
EVEN IF I DIDN’T INVITE YOU.

1286
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,166
- GLASS OF WATER
WOULD BE FINE THEN.

1287
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,325
- I’D OFFER YOU A CHAIR,
BUT HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.

1288
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:46,395
WHY HE LEFT THE TV,
I NEVER WATCH THE THING.

1289
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:53,201
- MRS. PERKINS,
WE FOUND YOUR HUSBAND’S TRUCK.

1290
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,304
IT WAS OUTSIDE THE COUNTY.

1291
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,340
- WALTER WOULD NEVER LEAVE
HIS TRUCK FOR LONG.

1292
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:03,412
HE MUST BE ROUND ABOUT
WHERE YOU FOUND IT.

1293
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,348
MAYBE HE JUST NEEDED
SOME TIME AWAY,

1294
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,783
WENT TO A MOTEL.

1295
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,184
- MA’AM.

1296
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:11,953
THE TRUCK WAS 100 FOOT DOWN
PAINTER GORGE.

1297
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:14,089
- SWEET JESUS.

1298
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,425
- NOW, I DON’T THINK
WALTER WAS IN IT.

1299
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,794
- [sighs]

1300
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,430
- TELL ME, DID HE EVER MENTION
BEING OWED ANY MONEY?

1301
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:28,003
- THERE WAS ALWAYS FOLKS
SLOW PAYING FOR WORK...

1302
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:29,304
- RIGHT.

1303
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,273
- I DON’T KNOW.
NO.

1304
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:35,043
NO, HE NEVER SAID NOTHING.

1305
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:37,913
GO AND TAKE THOSE TO MY ROOM
AND STAY THERE.

1306
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:38,980
FOLD ’EM UP.

1307
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:42,918
AND, SON, GET YOUR BOOK.

1308
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:47,222
- N-N-NO.

1309
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,290
NO, NO, NO.

1310
01:18:48,323 --> 01:18:50,058
- PICK THOSE CLOTHES UP.

1311
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,427
- I’M SORRY.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

1312
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,329
- WHAT’S THIS?

1313
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:05,974
- AARON...

1314
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,910
IS THIS...

1315
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,479
- DADDY?

1316
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:18,220
- DAMN, MAN,
WITH ALL THAT BLOOD,

1317
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:21,423
THEY’RE GONNA GET
A CLEAN PRINT FOR SURE.

1318
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:25,093
I’M TELLING YOU,
MINE ARE DEFINITELY ON FILE.

1319
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,461
- WELL, MAYBE THAT LEAD
I INVENTED

1320
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,530
WILL SET ’EM OFF
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

1321
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,599
I DON’T KNOW,
BUT, SHANE,

1322
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,068
I TOLD CROW ABOUT TAYLOR.
- WHAT?

1323
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,303
- WERE YOU WILLING
TO LEAVE TOWN NOT KNOWING

1324
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:37,472
HOW LONG GIL’S GONNA HAVE TO SIT
IN THAT JAIL CELL

1325
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:41,143
FOR SOMETHING WE DID?

1326
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:43,111
- MAN, WHAT ABOUT TAZ?

1327
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,213
- [sighs]
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM.

1328
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,516
- WELL, MAYBE HE DOESN’T CARE
TO BE FOUND, OR DESERVE TO.

1329
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,117
- COME ON, MAN, YOU SAY THAT

1330
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:51,086
LIKE WE HAVEN’T KNOWN TAZ
FOR TEN YEARS.

1331
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,387
- [sighs]
UGH.

1332
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,556
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

1333
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:57,225
- OKAY, I’LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

1334
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,594
I GOT TO GET TO AARON
BEFORE THE BLACKBIRDS DO.

1335
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,264
- BEFORE THE WHAT?
- JUST--I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

1336
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,466
6:00.

1337
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,948
- YOU’D HAVE GONE SOMETIME,
I FIGURED...

1338
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,184
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

1339

- [sighs]

1340
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:34,996
I AIN’T GONNA HAVE TIME
TO GO VISIT DADDY, MAMA.

1341
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,933
- HE’S NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE.

1342
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:40,368
PROBABLY ALREADY KNOWS.

1343
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,604
HE’S UP THERE
GRINNIN’ EAR TO EAR SAYIN',

1344
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:46,107
"LOOK AT MY BOY;
AIN’T HE A SCOUNDREL?"

1345
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:50,078
TO ANYBODY WHO’D LISTEN.

[screen door bangs]

1350
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,371
- YOU RUN NOW, SHANE.

1351
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:20,242
YOU KEEP ON RUNNIN’
AND DON’T LOOK BACK.

1352
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:24,079

[sobs]

1354
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:42,163
- IF YOU COULD WATCH OUT

1355
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:46,067
MAYBE FIND HER A JOB
SOMEPLACE RESPECTABLE.

I TOOK HER CHEROKEE NAME.

1360
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:01,983
WELL, SHE KNEW YOU

01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:06,621
WHICH WAS THE YEAR
YOUR DAD CAME TO WORK FOR US.

1362
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:09,691
SHE ALWAYS CALLED YOU
"LITTLE SHEPHERD,"

1363
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,360
’CAUSE YOU'D CHASE
ALL THE SQUIRRELS AWAY

1364
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,697
BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS
COULD SHOOT ’EM WITH PELLETS.

1365
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,599
[chuckles]

1366
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:21,403
ANYWAY, WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT HERE
LOOKING FOR WORK

1367
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,205
AND NEVER CAME BACK,

1368
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,409
LILY HAD YOUR NAME CHANGED.

1369
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,112
SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT
A PERSON’S NAME

1370
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,515
SHOULD SAY MORE ABOUT ’EM
THAN WHERE THEY’RE FROM.

1371
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,183
[dog barking]

1372
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:44,192
YOUR DAD’S NAME IS REED.

1373
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,227
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS PLACE
A FEW TIMES

1374
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,530
JUST BEFORE HE LEFT.

1375
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:53,568
IT’S--IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE
ALBERTA.

1376
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,272
- [sighs]

1377
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:02,110
THANKS, CROW.

1378
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:11,619
- I HEAR THE FISHIN’S REAL GOOD
UP IN CANADA THIS TIME OF YEAR.

1379
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:15,223
STEELHEAD TROUT SEASON.

1380
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:18,626
I’D HURRY ON UP THERE,
IF I WAS YOU.

1381
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,095
GO ON.

1382
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,100
[sighs]

1383
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,140
[engine turns over]

1384
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:01,803
- THEY GOT AARON.

1385
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,204
- WHAT?

1386
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,573
- WHERE’S TAZ?

1387
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,642
- MAN, I DON’T KNOW.

1388
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:09,344
CAN’T GET A PEEP
OUT OF THE PLACE.

1389
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,280
HIS CAR’S AROUND BACK,
BUT...

1390
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:15,383
I DON’T KNOW. HE EITHER
AIN’T SHOWING, OR HE AIN'T HOME.

1391
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,118
- TAZ!

1392
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,456
TAZ!

1393
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,325
LOOK, WE DON’T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS SHIT.

1394
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,727
NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
STEP OUT HERE

1395
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,629
AND GET IN
THE GODDAMN TRUCK,

1396
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:29,330
OR YOU CAN STAY
HOLED UP IN THERE,

1397
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,266
AND THE SHERIFF’S BOYS
BREAK DOWN THE DOOR

1398
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,301
WITH THE SPECIAL BOOT THEY GOT
PREPARED FOR YOUR ASS.

1399
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,769
YOU GOT ABOUT FIVE SECONDS,

1400
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,138
’CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
EITHER WAY.

1401
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,781
- YOU MEAN THAT?

1402
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,352
- WHAT?
- YOU DON’T CARE WHAT I DO?

1403
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,221
- [sighs]

1404
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,156
TAZ, WE’RE STANDING HERE

1405
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,258
YELLING AT AN EMPTY CABIN
FOR ALL WE KNOW.

1406
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,894
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1407
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,163
- WELL, HOLD ON.

1408
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,568
- [sighs]

1409
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,838
- 129’s GONNA TAKE US
INTO TENNESSEE.

1410
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,340
WE HIT INTERSTATE IN KNOXVILLE,
THEN IT’S A FLAT-OUT RUN.

1411
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:13,641
- WELL, THAT’S IF WE STAY
AHEAD OF ’EM.

1412
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,276
- OKAY, SO, MAN, LET’S GO.

1413
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,178
- WAIT.
1974 RUNS BACK INTO I-40.

1414
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:20,582
MY PARENTS USED TO GO THIS WAY
TO GATLINBURG.

1415
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,217
- HEY, MAN, I DON’T GIVE A SHIT
WHICH WAY WE GO, MAN.

1416
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,252
- FORGET IT.
WE AIN’T GOIN' NOWHERE.

1417
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:25,553
- SHANE!

1418
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:26,921
SHANE, COME ON!

1419
01:25:32,727 --> 01:25:34,295
[dog barking]

1420
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:36,264
- HOT DAMN,
I TOLD Y’ALL.

1421
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:39,567
WHAT’D I SAY?

1422
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,302
WHOO!
WE GOT US A FIGHT COMING.

1423
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:43,872
- JIM, GET YOUR ASS BACK.

1424
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,773
- WHOSE ASS IN THE BREEZE NOW,
BROTHER?

1425
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,408
- I AIN’T GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN.

1426
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:48,943
GET YOUR ASS BACK THERE.
KEEP IT BACK THERE.

1427
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,845
- WHAT THE HELL?
WHAT’S HE DOING HERE?

1428
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,882
- I’M SORRY, MAN.

1429
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,383
SHIT!

1430
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,888
- BOYS, WE NEED TO TALK.

1431
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,640
- WE’RE FUCKED!

1432
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:22,310
- WALTER PERKINS DONE
TURNED IN HIS TICKET, I EXPECT.

1433
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:26,848
IS THAT RIGHT, SON?

1434
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:29,584
HE’S SAID ENOUGH ALREADY.

1435
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:34,689
THOSE PICTURES OF HIS
SPEAK A WHOLE HEAP OF WORDS.

1436
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,424
REAL LIFE-LIKE TOO.

1437
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:39,627
- WHAT’S HE TALKIN' ABOUT?
- I DON’T KNOW.

1438
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:41,329
THERE’S A PAGE MISSING
FROM AARON’S BOOK.

1439
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,864
I NEVER FOUND IT.

1440
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:46,968
- Y’ALL GOT
ONE MORE DECISION TO MAKE.

1441
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,404
SO TAKE YOUR TIME.

1442
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,306
IT’S UP TO YOU.

1443
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,875
BUT LET ME TELL YOU
HOW THIS SHOW’S GONNA END.

1444
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,944
YOU’RE GONNA WALK OUT
ON THE PORCH,

1445
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:59,414
YOU’RE GONNA
COME ALONG WITH ME,

1446
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,015
AND WE’LL
TALK THIS THING THROUGH

1447
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:03,785
WITH 12 REAL
REASONABLE-TYPE FOLKS.

1448
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,787
- [scoffs]
YEAH.

1449
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:10,358
- BECAUSE Y’ALL ARE
TOO DAMN SMART TO DO OTHERWISE.

1450
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:14,896
LIKE I SAID,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

1451
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,999
HOLD HIM IN THE VAN.

1452
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:24,872
- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

1453
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,809
- HAVIN’ A DAMN PICNIC.
[both sigh]

1454
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,777
- WELL, WE AIN’T EXACTLY
THE DALTON GANG

1455
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:32,380
HELD UP IN HERE.
- FUCK ’EM.

1456
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,415
THEY CAN COME GET US.

1457
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,517
- THEY SHOULD LET JIMBO
LEAD THE CHARGE.

1458
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:48,630
- DANNY...

1459
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:49,864
DANNY.

1460
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:51,566
- WHAT IS IT?

1461
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,609
- WHAT YOU DOIN’?
- HEY.

1462
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,045
- CARRIE?

1463
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,881
CARRIE, STOP. WE’RE NOT
PLAYIN’ AROUND OUT HERE.

1464
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:08,516
- LET ME SEE HER.
- GOT A GUN.

1465
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,752
- PUT IT DOWN.
PUT IT DOWN.

1466
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:14,022
- SHE KNOWS WHAT’S FOR REAL.

1467
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:33,975
- GET HIM BACK IN THERE.

1468
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:41,449
- [sighs]

1469
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:54,028
- MAN, I CAN’T SEE A DAMN THING.
CAN YOU?

1470
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:55,730
- NO.

1471
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:59,834
[sighs]
BUT THEY CAN.

1472
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,569
- ONLY WHERE THEY’RE POINTING.

1473
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,707
SEARCHLIGHTS DIDN’T MAKE
THE BUDGET THIS YEAR.

1474
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,008
- FELLAS?

1475
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,076
WE’RE READY TO TALK.

1476
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,911
WE’VE BEEN READY.

1477
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:12,180
COME ON OUT ON THE PORCH.

1478
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:14,182
DANNY?

1479
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,084
- I’M GONNA GO.

1480
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,919
- OKAY, WELL,
I’M GOING WITH YOU.

1481
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:19,821
- NO, JUST STAY PUT.

1482
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,490
- SHIT!
- [gun cocks]

1483
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,529
- YOU’RE OUT THERE?

1484
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,632
- RIGHT HERE.

1485
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,168
- HOW ABOUT THE FRONT STEPS?

1486
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,440
- OKAY.

1487
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:48,883
SHIT, DANNY,
WHAT’D I TELL YOU?

1488
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:52,186
- OH, COME ON, MAN.
WHAT GOOD IS THAT?

1489
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,591
- MAYBE GET YOU TO THINK
FOR ONE GODDAMN MINUTE...

1490
01:29:56,624 --> 01:29:58,092
THAT THIS IS SERIOUS.

1491
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,761
WE GOT A COUPLE GUYS OUT THERE

1492
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,829
ACT LIKE THEY’RE
SPOTLIGHTIN’ DEER.

1493
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:05,600
THEY’RE JUST WAITIN' FOR Y’ALL
TO GIVE THEM AN EXCUSE.

1494
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:07,835
- ALL I’VE BEEN DOIN'
IS THINKING...

1495
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:09,637
ABOUT HOW TO TURN
THINGS AROUND.

1496
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,873
- YOU SHOULD’VE NEVER LET IT
GET THIS FAR.

1497
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,713
THERE MUST BE
100 KIDS IN THIS TOWN

1498
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,615
WHO’D HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING
TO HAVE YOUR FUTURE

1499
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:23,584
IN FRONT OF ’EM.

1500
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,553
NOW LOOK WHERE YOU STAND.

1501
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,591
DON’T PUT MY SISTER
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

1502
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,226
AND MAKE THINGS WORSE.

1503
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,195
THAT AIN’T THE WAY.

1504
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:37,131
- THEN TELL ME WHAT IS--
- THE WAY BY LAW.

1505
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,502
- THE REACH OF YOUR LAW

1506
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:45,239
STOPPED AT THAT KID’S FRONT DOOR
FOR 17 YEARS.

1507
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,508
YOU’RE RIGHT.

1508
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:50,278
WE NEVER SHOULD’VE LET IT
GET THIS FAR.

1509
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,380
WHY DID YOU?

1510
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,187
- I ALWAYS LIKED YOU, DANNY.

1511
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,556
I TREATED YOU LIKE A BROTHER,

1512
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:04,058
’CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
IT SEEMED SOMETIMES.

1513
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,930
BUT YOU’RE NO KIN TO ME.

1514
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:18,206
IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO CARRIE...

1515
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,156
[door rattles]

1516
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:39,260
- [sighs]
- WHAT’D HE SAY?

1517
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,562
- HE DOESN’T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

1518
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,130
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

1519
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:45,266
- BEIN’ WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW,
I’D LET US GO.

1520
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:49,637
- THEN WHY DON’T YOU
SUGGEST THAT?

1521
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,239
[sighs]

1522
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,877
LOOK.

1523
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,946
FIVE MINUTES OUT OF THIS COVE
IN ANY DIRECTION,

1524
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,650
AND THEY’RE GONNA BE
RIGHT ON TOP OF US.

1525
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,252
WE GOT SHIT FOR ODDS.

1526
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,823
- GREAT PEP TALK, CAP’N.

1527
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,793
- HE’S RIGHT, SHANE.

1528
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:16,330
WE CAN WAIT THIS THING OUT
A LONG TIME,

1529
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:19,033
BUT THEY’LL WAIT LONGER.

1530
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:20,935
IF THEY DO DECIDE
TO BUST ON IN,
