1
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,543
Let him burn!

2
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,839
You are going to die!

3
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,844
This is the last one!

4
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,796
We have her!

5
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,177
Let's go, boys!

6
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,278
You will never get her! Never!

7
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,208
I've been hit!

8
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,709
Keep going! Go!

9
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,890
You will get what you deserve.

10
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,556
You will get yours.

11
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:16,551
You are the damned.

12
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:08,478
He's going for his gun!

13
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:10,896
Let's go! Let's go!

14
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:20,537
Be thankful my son dragged you here
behind his horse.

15
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:29,500
There are stories of a killer on the trail.

16
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,714
He awakens.

17
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,542
Look at him.

18
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,838
He awakens and does not know where he is.

19
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,866
This one wants to steal a horse.

20
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:43,971
You brought an evil white man into our camp.

21
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:50,944
This diseased filth needs to go.

22
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:58,858
At the last village they told a story about
a killer out there killing men and taking women.

23
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,450
You saw him.

24
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:04,334
He was possessed by evil spirits!

25
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,830
Seven winters...

26
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,540
Seven women.

27
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,920
Father, it is my duty to honor my commitment
to save his life.

28
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,296
Go on, son.

29
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:27,143
I tried to force him into cold waters
with my bow.

30
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:35,823
When his gun overcame me he spared my life.

31
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:54,578
Your foolishness has brought a great burden.

32
00:38:55,836 --> 00:39:03,126
We will find out what kind of man
you have brought amongst us.

33
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:11,226
Bring him to the sweat lodge.

34
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:19,776
Let us see how the white man likes
our peyote.

35
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:26,777
This one must go now.

36
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,455
This man is your responsibility.

37
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,580
You have honored your debt to him.

38
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:50,641
Give him your horse so he leaves and
never comes back.

39
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,769
May you find your way.

40
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,437
Crazy man!

41
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,363
Go now!

42
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,117
Crazy man.

43
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,662
Go. Go now!

44
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,294
Crazy man!

45
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:26,042
Go now!

46
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:44,767
Where is César?

47
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,440
I want to leave.

48
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:48,864
Over there.

49
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:55,072
Let's go, César!

50
01:00:56,156 --> 01:01:00,326
Relax Guillermo, we are almost to the house!

51
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,480
Stay!

52
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,574
He will kill us all.

53
01:02:59,988 --> 01:03:01,108
Let's go!

54
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:04,035
We have to get her to safety!

55
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,053
Listen! Listen!

56
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:07,886
Get the children!

57
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:10,564
Get into the house!

58
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:12,348
Fast! Fast! Fast!

59
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:42,579
My sister will never be with you.

60
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:11,950
Come out and face me!

61
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:06,013
If you touch her I will kill you!

62
01:15:51,635 --> 01:15:53,395
I am going to kill you!

63
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:57,867
I am not afraid. I am not afraid.

64
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:03,462
Don't do it.

65
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:11,051
We can stop.

66
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:15,299
There does not need to be any more death.
