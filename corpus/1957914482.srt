1
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,508
- Let's go
over it one more time.

2
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,346
What happened after that?

3
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,523
Answer the question.

4
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,196
What happened after that?

5
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,602
- I was talking to him.

6
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,738
- Where were
you when that happened?

7
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,373
- A few feet away.

8
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,245
- Did you try to stop
him?

9
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,450
Answer the question.
Did you try to stop him?

10
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,424
Answer the question.
Did you try to stop him?

11
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,814
- Have you ever had a
moment when your mind

12
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:58,251
was completely free, blank?

13
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,488
No thoughts at all I mean.

14
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:03,791
Empty.

15
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,226
Peaceful.

16
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,299
I was looking for that my whole
life,

17
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:17,237
but all I ever found
was obsession, darkness,

18
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,474
cold, deep darkness.

19
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,544
- And what
happened after the phone call?

20
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,213
- The
station sent two officers

21
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,782
to check the apartment.

22
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,417
- Sir, this is the police.

23
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,386
Put the gun down.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,187
- They found Jay on his
knees,

25
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,791
pointing the gun to his own
head, frozen.

26
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,628
They kept calling him,
but he wasn't moving.

27
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:44,866
- I could feel it.

28
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,670
A painful crack in my chest,

29
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,706
My ribs falling apart.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,909
Bones crumbling.

31
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,344
I had to learn how to deal with
it.

32
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,312
- The main door was
cracked open,

33
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,314
and they could see someone
laying on the floor.

34
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,183
That became the priority.

35
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,856
- But now I knew
what it is.

36
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,025
It was you.

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,293
You are always in the air.

38
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:19,199
I was breathing you.

39
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,808
Hey, shh, shh, shh.

40
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:30,678
Everything's gonna be okay.

41
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:32,780
I know what I need to do now.

42
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,919
- There were mirror
stands everywhere, all broken.

43
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,588
A pool a blood from one side to
the other.

44
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:42,924
It was too late.

45
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,928
The victim was stabbed in the
stomach with a shard of glass.

46
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,998
- You're the one who
smokes.

47
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,300
Not me.

48
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:01,776
- I've never seen
anything like this before.

49
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,147
He wasn't moving, and
his eyes were wide open,

50
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,715
staring into the distance.

51
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,485
- Just like Judie said.

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,088
- I remember.

53
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:18,425
I remember everything.

54
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,467
- Everything is gonna be
okay.

55
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,103
I promise.

56
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:34,441
- Our beloved Judie faced
this disease in the same way...

57
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,958
She was an example to all of us,

58
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,029
always putting the needs
of others before her own.

59
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,970
Judie was a good daughter.

60
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:13,815
She was great sister to Jay.

61
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,687
And she was a friend.

62
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,089
A real friend.

63
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:25,960
She only asked for one
thing before she passed.

64
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,396
I'm glad that we can all be
here today to do this for her.

65
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,806
She always loved the light here.

66
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,577
This is where she wanted to be.

67
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:44,712
Judie...

68
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,049
we'll never forget you.

69
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,418
- I'm so sorry for your loss,
Jay.

70
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,558
I want you to know that the
entire crew is with you.

71
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,003
- Jay.

72
00:06:43,004 --> 00:06:45,740
We never met before,
but I knew your sister,

73
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,744
and I'm really sorry for your
loss.

74
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:54,382
She was a very special, special
person.

75
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,783
Take care of yourself.

76
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:57,952
I wish you well.

77
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,766
- How dare you?

78
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:17,204
How dare you bring one of your
sluts here?

79
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,177
Do you have no respect for your
sister?

80
00:07:25,413 --> 00:07:26,948
Shame on you.

81
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,952
- You're just jealous.

82
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,222
Jealous I finally have
somebody else in my life

83
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,489
except for you.

84
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:41,128
- Don't play with me, kid.

85
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:46,767
This is family stuff. This is
family.

86
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,537
Our family.

87
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,476
- Yeah, well, maybe that's
family now.

88
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,114
- Don't be stupid. You don't
even know these people.

89
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,061
Is that the watch?

90
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,801
Shame on you.

91
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,498
- Can you tell
me about your relationship

92
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,732
with his sister?

93
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:58,239
- I was her therapist
for the last eight years.

94
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,876
She died of cancer about six
months ago.

95
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:06,714
The only time I ever met Jay
was at his sister's funeral.

96
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,783
- Did they tell
you who the victim is?

97
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,260
- But I don't understand,
detective.

98
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:28,235
Why do you need me here?

99
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:32,773
- No.

100
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,115
- Is everything okay?

101
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,485
- I'm fine.

102
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,858
- I saw your mother
talking to you.

103
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,766
She was staring at me the whole
time.

104
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,903
- Don't worry about her.

105
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,089
- Probably wasn't the
best idea for me to come.

106
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:24,625
- Don't say that.

107
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,831
- No, I didn't belong there.

108
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,034
- You do belong there.

109
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,605
You're family. She needs
to understand that.

110
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,842
She's always trying to
control my fucking life.

111
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,844
I'm sick of her.

112
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:50,384
- I understand. But she seemed
pretty...

113
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,189
- She's just like that.

114
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,825
You know what she's like.

115
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,194
- No, I don't.

116
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,434
Jay, seriously, how could I know
that?

117
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,874
I'm just saying maybe
it wasn't the best idea

118
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,443
to introduce me at your sister's
funeral.

119
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,184
- What are you talking about?

120
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,821
- How did he wake up,
detective? What did you do?

121
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:33,694
- I did nothing. I just
called him by his name.

122
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:35,696
Jay...

123
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,632
Can you hear me?

124
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,366
He didn't know how he got there,

125
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,669
what happened in his house,

126
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,037
or why he was trying to kill
himself.

127
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,320
- No.

128
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:16,804
- Mm!

129
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,506
This is delicious.

130
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:21,141
Did you make it?

131
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,178
- Yes. All fresh and
organic.

132
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,279
- Mm!

133
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,414
- It's from the store,
right?

134
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,782
- That's right.

135
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:30,918
- What store?

136
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,221
- Jay didn't tell you?

137
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,092
I run a distribution company of
organic

138
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,595
and mostly vegetarian food.

139
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:44,064
And last year I opened a brick
and mortar store downtown.

140
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:47,034
- It's actually where we
met.

141
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,205
- So you were the client
falling in love with the owner.

142
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:53,374
- Maybe.

143
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,143
Maybe it's the other way around.

144
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:00,047
- Hmm. Maybe.

145
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,085
- Let's start from the
beginning.

146
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,087
How did you get to this point?

147
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:10,324
- He called 911
himself a few hours ago.

148
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,027
Sergeant, can you play
the recording please?

149
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,997
- He's trying to do it
again.

150
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,301
I can't allow it. Not this time.

151
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,871
I think I know how to stop him.

152
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,341
This is wrong.

153
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,208
Shut up!

154
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:29,943
- Who's he talking to?

155
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,211
We think it's possible there

156
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,080
may have been someone else
there.

157
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,617
- He brought her to my
house. He brought her here.

158
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:39,019
- And what happened
after the phone call?

159
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:49,096
- So you're a vegetarian now?

160
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,464
- I like to eat healthy.

161
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,171
- Just saying, have you
seen yourself in the mirror?

162
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:00,374
- The mirror?

163
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,544
What about the mirror?

164
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:05,479
- I've never seen you so skinny.

165
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,448
And I hardly see you.

166
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,484
- Can you stop?

167
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,953
You wanna stop telling me what
to do?

168
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,289
- Hey, hey, come on.

169
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,159
Let's not get into one
of your fights right now.

170
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,963
Okay? Let's just enjoy this
dinner.

171
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,672
- I'm just saying you
need your protein,

172
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:34,074
or I'm gonna be seeing
your bones very soon.

173
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,012
- Meat is not the only
way to get protein.

174
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,517
We can all get plenty without
eating meat.

175
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,792
- Are you one of those animal
lovers?

176
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,129
- Yes, I am.

177
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,302
You have any pets?

178
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,007
- We used to have a dog
many years ago

179
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,342
when these two guys were kids

180
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,944
and living in the country
with me.

181
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,914
- What was his name?

182
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,220
- Roy.

183
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,624
His name was Roy.

184
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,629
- Do you guys
remember him?

185
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,264
- Vaguely.

186
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,266
- You were very little,
maybe eight or nine.

187
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,042
- What happened to Roy...

188
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:45,613
if I may ask.

189
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,186
- Someone left the door
open, and he ran away.

190
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,622
- Ran away?

191
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,258
- Yeah. Simple as that.

192
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,195
He left.

193
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,434
See, it isn't true that
animals always love you.

194
00:16:11,906 --> 00:16:13,307
- There's something...

195
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,043
something very dark in this
family

196
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,978
that I was never quite able to
see.

197
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,415
Judie had been keeping a
secret for over 20 years

198
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,450
to protect her little brother.

199
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:26,788
But there's a time in one of our
sessions

200
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,088
that she told me about something

201
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,090
that happened in the country
house.

202
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,660
Jay was only eight years old.

203
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,999
Something happened with their
dog.

204
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,985
- So how's work, sweetheart?

205
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,018
- It's...

206
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,453
fine.

207
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:02,957
We closed down the contract this
week, and um...

208
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,392
They start in a couple weeks.

209
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:06,393
- Good.

210
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:08,963
I hope you'll be able to afford

211
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,198
a better place than this soon.

212
00:17:19,574 --> 00:17:20,440
- Jay...

213
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,647
I'm so proud of you.

214
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,351
Congratulations.

215
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:32,987
Congrats.

216
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,121
- Congrats.

217
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,509
- What?

218
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:56,878
- Yeah, what, mom?
Stop it.

219
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,379
- We don't need
guns here.

220
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:02,416
Okay? Just calm down, Jay.

221
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,287
Guys, lower the guns.

222
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,694
- At this point, we're not
rushing.

223
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,163
We're just taking the time to
negotiate.

224
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:20,233
All right, Jay. Now it's your
turn.

225
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,469
Put your gun down so we can
talk.

226
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:24,806
Slowly.

227
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:27,675
Very slowly.

228
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,848
I'm going outside to smoke.

229
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,218
- You said you were
gonna stop.

230
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,521
- Give me a break, Mom. Hm?

231
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:47,729
- Judie, you shouldn't be
smoking in your condition.

232
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,130
- She's actually right, you
know.

233
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,736
- I'm gonna die anyways, right?

234
00:18:56,604 --> 00:19:00,140
So just let me enjoy the
time that I have left.

235
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:04,679
You wanna smoke?

236
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,346
- Oh, no thanks.

237
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,049
I don't smoke.

238
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,618
- It's okay. You don't have
to be shy if you wanna smoke.

239
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:11,619
Go with her.

240
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,758
- No, Jay.

241
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:19,192
I don't smoke.

242
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,131
I never did,

243
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:32,840
But I will join you
outside for some fresh air.

244
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,274
- All right.

245
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,044
Let's have some girl talk.

246
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,190
- Just like Judie said.

247
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,926
- This happened before?

248
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,730
- Not while I knew her, and not
like this.

249
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,632
I mean, Judie did talk about how
Jay

250
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,500
had some strange experiences
in his sleep as a child,

251
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,637
but after we discussed it some
more,

252
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,439
I realized it was just sleep
paralysis.

253
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:10,377
It can be pretty disturbing
if you don't know what it is.

254
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:19,252
It's kind of the state in
between being awake and
dreaming.

255
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:22,222
Your mind is aware, but
your muscles are relaxed

256
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,958
as if you're still asleep.

257
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,594
You can think clearly, but you
might also have visions, too,

258
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:28,563
which makes it extremely unclear

259
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:31,632
what is real and what is the
dream.

260
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,570
You have no voluntary muscular
control.

261
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,905
It's like being trapped in your
own body.

262
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,908
You can see, but you
might also have flashes

263
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,242
from your dreams as well,

264
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,778
because the door to the
unconscious mind

265
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,278
hasn't quite closed yet.

266
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,955
- Don't be
afraid.

267
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,924
Do you remember me?

268
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:01,662
She wouldn't let see you for a
long time,

269
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:05,867
your sister, but I never left
you.

270
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,871
Now that she is gone, there is
one more thing you have to do.

271
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:10,872
Remember.

272
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,340
Remember.

273
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,146
Do you remember me?

274
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,046
Remember.

275
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,413
- Jay.

276
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,583
- Do you remember me now?
- Jay, wake up!

277
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,992
- I'm Dr. Rivers.

278
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,761
I was called here to assist.

279
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,618
- Thank you for coming.
Please have a seat.

280
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,058
Wait here for a moment.

281
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:00,882
- He's here.

282
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,622
- What did he say to you? The
cop.

283
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,758
Was it about me?

284
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,995
- No, Jay. It was not
about you.

285
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,299
But I have to leave for a
moment.

286
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,568
- Why? It was about me, wasn't
it?

287
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,470
- I just need a few
moments, Jay.

288
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,006
Just a few minutes.

289
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,441
Everything's fine, I promise.

290
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,112
Are you gonna be okay?

291
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,016
- Just a few minutes.

292
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:38,786
Okay.

293
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,787
Be quick.

294
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:58,205
- Jay? Can you hear me?

295
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,444
- Judie.

296
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,018
What are you doing here?

297
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,726
- Thank you for coming.

298
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,629
I am Diana Suarez, the detective
in charge of this case,

299
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:23,531
You have already met Sergeant
Marquez,

300
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,766
who's directing the police
response.

301
00:24:27,368 --> 00:24:28,502
As you can see, we're dealing

302
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,804
with a very complicated
situation here.

303
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:31,372
- I was her therapist for the
last...

304
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,380
Why do you need me?

305
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,116
Something happened with their
dog.

306
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,888
- Jay's talking to
me as if I was his sister.

307
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:03,170
- Did she follow the
procedure?

308
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:08,175
Officer, I need you to
answer the question.

309
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,752
- I think she saw the
opportunity to connect with him.

310
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:24,091
- I understand that it's
difficult to believe

311
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,427
that he sees Judie instead of
you,

312
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,197
but our mind can affect the way
that we experience the world

313
00:25:30,331 --> 00:25:31,832
and what we call reality.

314
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:34,835
We see what we want or
what we need to see.

315
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,705
And right now, Jay needs his
sister.

316
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,347
Maybe...

317
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:50,251
Maybe we can take advantage of
that.

318
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,478
It's a long shot, but we might
be able to use the connection

319
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:21,048
that he has with Judie to
delve into his unconscious.

320
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:22,551
- How do we go about
doing that?

321
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:24,385
- If it was sleep paralysis,

322
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,253
he wouldn't have been
able to move or speak,

323
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:29,990
but he still would have been
a conscious, silent witness.

324
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,826
He just doesn't remember it.

325
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:35,362
- It's worth a shot.

326
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:41,235
But how do I keep the illusion
going?

327
00:26:43,037 --> 00:26:44,772
I made it work for a while,

328
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:47,308
but having a confrontation
is very different.

329
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:50,644
- Connect on the same emotional
level.

330
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,980
We all have secrets.

331
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,919
Think back to something that
you feel responsible for,

332
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:01,255
to something that you feel
guilty about.

333
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,790
Bring it forward.

334
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:05,326
Project it onto Jay just like
Judie did.

335
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:15,436
Our mind is an incredible tool.

336
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,737
It has a way of connecting us

337
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:18,205
on a number of different levels

338
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,408
that we can't even
understand or comprehend.

339
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:25,713
We need to guide Jay to
that part of his unconscious

340
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,248
that he shares with Judie.

341
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:28,782
That's where we're gonna
find the broken memories

342
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,751
of what happened here.

343
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:51,772
- Do you want to talk about it?

344
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,911
- You want a drink?

345
00:27:58,647 --> 00:27:59,713
- I'm good.

346
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,726
- There was something
different this time.

347
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,928
- What was it?

348
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,835
- I saw who was keeping
the dog in the leash.

349
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:28,610
It was a kid.

350
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:29,810
- A kid?

351
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,413
- Yeah.

352
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:45,125
- Who was he?

353
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:47,962
- I don't know.

354
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:51,365
- What did he look like?

355
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,336
- He wore a mask on half his
face.

356
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:57,972
This side.

357
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,842
The whole left side.

358
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,316
- So you don't know what he
looks like?

359
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,320
- He showed me, but I couldn't
see.

360
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,427
I think he hurt himself.

361
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,397
- Hey...

362
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:26,100
It's okay.

363
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,903
You're tired, Jay.

364
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:34,174
It was a stressful day
yesterday at the funeral.

365
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:38,445
It was a big deal.

366
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,651
All this is gonna take time.

367
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:51,825
- There was something else.

368
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:53,827
The kid...

369
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,367
He said he'd been with me the
whole time.

370
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,574
- Hey...

371
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,474
Jay...

372
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,743
- I don't wanna...

373
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:09,611
Don't touch me.

374
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,045
- Jay.

375
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:11,979
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Jay, Jay, Jay.

376
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,982
It was just a dream.

377
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,451
It was a dream. It was just a
dream.

378
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:18,952
It was a dream!

379
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:20,487
Jay.

380
00:30:20,622 --> 00:30:21,488
- Okay.

381
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,191
- Well, what was it then?

382
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:40,675
- Dr. Rivers, I've set up a line
for you.

383
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,844
Detective Suarez will hear
everything that you say.

384
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:49,249
I've also set up a camera

385
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:52,086
with a view of everything
that is happening in the yard.

386
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,522
You can see it on that screen
right there.

387
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,831
- You want to protect Jay.

388
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:06,166
Judie wants to protect him from
the world,

389
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:10,471
from other people, from himself
too.

390
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:16,910
Remember, it's all about
Jay. There's no resistance.

391
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:20,715
- Where have you been?

392
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:22,784
You said a few minutes.
- I know.

393
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,652
- Only a few minutes.

394
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,487
That's what you said to me.
- Yes, I know. I know. You're
right.

395
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:27,655
I'm sorry, okay?

396
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:30,525
But I'm here now.

397
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:33,460
Like always.

398
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,464
Jay, I just wanna talk.

399
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:39,634
Like we always did.

400
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,435
- She cares about him.

401
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,704
- I'm worried about you.

402
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:46,039
I've never seen you like this
before.

403
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:49,343
I feel for you.

404
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,914
There must be a reason
why you would point a gun

405
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:55,115
to your head.

406
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:58,952
- I'm trying. I'm trying
really hard, but I...

407
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:00,487
I can't remember.

408
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:05,426
- There's one thing that
Judie always said about Jay.

409
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:07,461
Hidden fear.

410
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:12,332
He may seem distant, but
he's deeply tormented inside.

411
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:16,036
Go with it. You feel what he
feels.

412
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,271
- I'm scared, Jay.

413
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:21,609
I'm scared.

414
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:27,381
Because I know how painful
it is not to remember.

415
00:32:32,554 --> 00:32:33,987
- I'm broken.

416
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,322
- You need to connect with that.

417
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:37,625
- I can't put all the pieces
together.

418
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,660
- Use that connection.

419
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:40,093
- Yes we can. Yes we can.

420
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:43,464
We can do it together, you
and I. Okay?

421
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:46,066
- And dig deep into his
memories,

422
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,068
starting with the last
thing that he remembers.

423
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,839
- What is the last
thing that you remember?

424
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,741
- Last night, I fell asleep.

425
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,344
I passed out and I...

426
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,346
I woke up here. I don't know
how.

427
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,748
- What did you do last
night?

428
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:02,115
- I was just drinking.

429
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:05,285
- Were you alone?

430
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,088
- He left me.

431
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,490
He left me, Judie.

432
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:12,326
So I started to drink.

433
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:16,263
I passed out and he wasn't here.

434
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,765
- Did he say "he"?

435
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,075
- He?

436
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,780
- I didn't do this.

437
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:35,282
I didn't kill him.

438
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:40,722
I loved him.

439
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,524
- The person that he sees on the
floor

440
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,425
is not the same person that we
see.

441
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,996
You need to stay with that
memory.

442
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:49,129
Follow that.

443
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,297
- I know.

444
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,833
I know you didn't.

445
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,603
- I thought things were good
between us.

446
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:58,138
Did you notice anything weird
the last time you saw him?

447
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,508
- Judie never said anything
about this.

448
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,545
- No. No, I didn't.

449
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,182
Why do you think he broke up
with you?

450
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,485
- We had a fight.

451
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:16,758
- So you saw him last night? He
was here?

452
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:19,059
- No, I mean before that.

453
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:23,798
We went out for dinner, and
there was this girl there.

454
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:28,468
She was staring at me the
whole time as if she knew me.

455
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:29,469
She looked mean,

456
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,707
made me feel like I'd
done something bad to her.

457
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,207
- Keep looking at?

458
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,579
- Sean noticed what was
going on,

459
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:41,448
so I tell him about this girl
and...

460
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,449
- Sean.

461
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,819
- He looks at her and...

462
00:34:45,887 --> 00:34:47,287
he doesn't know her either.

463
00:34:48,856 --> 00:34:50,257
- Do you know her?

464
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,726
She's staring.

465
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,698
- She finally stands up and
walks towards our table.

466
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,068
She stands in front of
me without saying a word.

467
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,503
She's just staring at me.

468
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:04,772
So I say something like...

469
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:05,640
Do I know you?

470
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,174
"Do I know you?"

471
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:10,878
- She flashes this smile, this
fake smile.

472
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,380
And then she pours her drink on
my lap.

473
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:14,916
And then she says...

474
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:17,451
- It turns
me on how wet you are.

475
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:22,322
I love to feel it between my
fingers.

476
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:25,760
I wanna fuck you.

477
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,762
I wanna fuck you now.

478
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,832
- And then she turns
to Sean and she says.

479
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:34,068
- That's what
he said to me three days ago.

480
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:35,737
Tuesday night.

481
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,074
Just like every Tuesday for the
last year.

482
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,076
- And then she just
leaves.

483
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:48,482
Maybe this is all my fault.

484
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,653
- What makes you feel
that way?

485
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,755
- What makes you feel
that way?

486
00:35:53,888 --> 00:35:56,724
- We went back home and he
wasn't even talking to me,

487
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,626
so I pushed him.

488
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:04,532
I already told you I have
never seen her before.

489
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,367
- Jay, I was right in front of
you.

490
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:11,304
You know what? I'm tired.

491
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,774
And it's not about what just
happened.

492
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,042
I didn't want to say anything,
but...

493
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,243
- I brought up some things,

494
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:17,411
things that had been bothering
me

495
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,446
for the last couple of weeks.

496
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,584
I told him he felt different.

497
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:27,155
- Since the
funeral you've become...

498
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,556
- He became...

499
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,222
- Distant.

500
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,424
- Distant.

501
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:32,794
- Aggressive.

502
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,595
- Aggressive.

503
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:37,431
- Mean.

504
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:39,834
- I didn't say anything until
last night,

505
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:44,237
but everything started
the day after the funeral.

506
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:46,541
- I told him...

507
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:50,111
I felt like I didn't
even know him anymore.

508
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,446
- I don't even know you anymore,
Jay.

509
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,449
I really don't know you.

510
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:59,319
- He left.

511
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,222
He left me, Judie.

512
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:05,492
- I'm sorry everything fell
apart.

513
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:10,965
But this is probably
how it's supposed to be.

514
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:16,604
Goodbye, Jay. Take care of
yourself.

515
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:29,449
- So last night, after
he left,

516
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,284
you did not see him again.

517
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,359
- No. I never saw
him again until now.

518
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:42,797
- What the fuck was that?

519
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,600
What kind of asshole are you to
pretend you don't know me?

520
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:51,038
I'm talking to you, asshole!

521
00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:53,741
You don't even have the
balls to look at me?

522
00:37:54,675 --> 00:37:57,712
Are you still pretending
you don't know me?

523
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:04,384
I only came here for one reason.

524
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,827
This piece of shit belongs to
you, to your fucking family.

525
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,731
I don't want anything more from
you.

526
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,366
You sick fuck!

527
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,806
- Do you really
remember nothing after that?

528
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:33,313
- I was just drinking.

529
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,619
I passed out, and I woke up

530
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:40,755
pointing this fucking gun to my
head.

531
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:46,493
Everything started the
day after the funeral.

532
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,932
- You said "he".

533
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,667
You said Sean...

534
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,904
started changing after the
funeral.

535
00:38:57,038 --> 00:39:00,875
- Yeah. Pretty sure it
was that same night.

536
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:04,145
- What funeral was that?

537
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,413
- What do you mean?

538
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,351
- I'm just a little bit
confused.

539
00:39:12,452 --> 00:39:13,554
There are so many things going
on.

540
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:14,989
I'm just a little bit nervous,

541
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:18,159
and I've been to more than one
funeral

542
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,927
over the last few months.

543
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,396
- I'm talking about the
last time you saw Sean.

544
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:32,540
At mom's funeral.

545
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:34,407
- Holy shit.

546
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:39,914
- Judie.

547
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:40,948
- He's projecting
his mother's funeral

548
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:41,549
over Judie's.

549
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:42,717
- Hey, Judie...

550
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,819
- Yes, yes.

551
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,122
- Ask him when the funeral was.

552
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:54,427
- Jay, do you remember
what day that funeral was?

553
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,733
- Is something wrong with you
right now?

554
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,701
- I am just trying to remember
something

555
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:03,403
that happened on that very same
day.

556
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:06,807
- It was Thursday.

557
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,978
It was two weeks ago.

558
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:14,515
- He has blacked out the last
six months.

559
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,527
There must be something more
than what just happened here.

560
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:32,133
Judie's death must have
triggered
some old broken memories,

561
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,368
'cause he's created a
lot of false memories

562
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,504
that he actually truly believes

563
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,172
but to the extent that I've
never seen

564
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:39,472
anything like it before.

565
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,275
Remembering things differently

566
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,844
than the way that they actually
happened is not uncommon.

567
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:45,713
He's actually distorting
reality,

568
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:47,548
stretching people, places.

569
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,884
You see, when you suffer
a traumatic experience,

570
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,986
one that you can't accept
this part of yourself,

571
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,823
the mind can hide or
remove those memories.

572
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,234
So he actually believes that the
funeral

573
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:08,636
was only two weeks ago,

574
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,338
and that it was far his
mother, not his sister.

575
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,507
He believes that she is here,
right now, in front of him.

576
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,409
And he believes that he
passed out last night

577
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:16,944
and then suddenly woke up to
this.

578
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:19,213
This is just a distortion.
It's all a projection.

579
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,622
He didn't pass out last night.

580
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,758
He blacked out six months ago.

581
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,663
Now we've got two questions.

582
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:41,102
What's he been doing
for the last six months?

583
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,704
- And who's Sean?

584
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:56,283
- This piece of belongs to
you, to your fucking family.

585
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,955
I don't want anything more from
you.

586
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,557
You sick fuck!

587
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:19,707
Well, what was it then?

588
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,412
It was just a dream.

589
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:25,346
You're okay.

590
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,081
Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay.

591
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,084
You're okay, Jay.

592
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:36,557
- Is that the watch?

593
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:47,735
This is family. This is family.

594
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,171
Our family.

595
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:12,693
Come on, make a wish.

596
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,061
- Aloud, please. I wanna
hear it.

597
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:18,199
- No, it doesn't work that way.

598
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:19,667
Think of something.

599
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:22,470
Something you really want.

600
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,637
- Ready?

601
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,172
Do it.

602
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,612
- Okay.

603
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:34,381
I have something for you,
Jay. Something really special.

604
00:43:34,516 --> 00:43:38,185
I'm gonna go get it. I'll be
right back.

605
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,062
- How do you feel, Jay?

606
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:55,703
I know it's been a difficult
summer,

607
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:56,971
and this change is tough for
you,

608
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:01,008
but everything is gonna be okay.

609
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:03,010
I promise

610
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:07,915
You'll like the new school, and
living in the city is great.

611
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:09,183
It's a good thing.

612
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,321
And we can see each other
the whole time if you want.

613
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:25,634
I know you don't get this now,

614
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,835
but trust me, you need to hear
this.

615
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:31,105
You need to get away from mom,
Jay.

616
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:37,344
- Here's my present.

617
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,248
For you.

618
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,953
Go ahead and open it.

619
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:58,032
You always used to ask
me about this watch.

620
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,436
Your father gave it to me. He
made it.

621
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:04,905
It was one of the first
things that he made

622
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,174
when he started the company.

623
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:10,344
He made two, and he used to wear
that one.

624
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:14,782
And he used to always say,

625
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:18,052
no matter where we go or where
we are,

626
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:22,356
it'll always be the same time
for both of us from now on.

627
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:30,297
It was his way of being close
to me while he was traveling.

628
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:34,703
And now, you're always
gonna feel my presence,

629
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:36,837
even when I'm not with you.

630
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:43,110
Come on, put it on.

631
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,183
Come on, put it on,

632
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:55,356
Put it on.

633
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:56,317
- Everything is gonna be okay.

634
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,318
I promise.

635
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,188
- I'm gonna die anyways, right?

636
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:04,592
Just let me enjoy the
time that I have left.

637
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:17,505
- Do you
remember me?

638
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:22,677
She wouldn't let me see
you for a long time.

639
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:24,144
Your sister.

640
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,113
Now that she is gone,

641
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:30,050
we can finally finish what
we started a long time ago.

642
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,887
You must do something.

643
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,959
You remember what happened,
right?

644
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:41,061
- It was a dream.

645
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:42,697
It was just a dream. It was a
dream.

646
00:47:42,831 --> 00:47:44,064
- Remember?

647
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:53,440
Remember.

648
00:47:57,111 --> 00:47:58,178
Remember.

649
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:25,973
- Relax.

650
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:33,313
Five...

651
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:35,550
Relax.

652
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:38,218
Four...

653
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:40,454
Remember.

654
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:42,690
Three...

655
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:44,726
Relax.

656
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:45,926
Two...

657
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:48,563
One...

658
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:51,800
Zero.

659
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:52,667
Remember.

660
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:53,934
Deep sleep.

661
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:56,805
What do you see?

662
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,980
- When I got back from school...

663
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:09,884
my mom wasn't home.

664
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:14,656
She had already left for
the weekend with this guy,

665
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:15,657
her lover.

666
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:19,661
I don't remember his name.

667
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,733
I was supposed to take care of
Jay.

668
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,002
As soon as I entered the house,

669
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,606
I knew there was something
wrong.

670
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,242
The chair was tilted over on its
side,

671
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,112
and the big mirror in the
living room was broken.

672
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,482
It was scary.

673
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,852
- There were
mirror stands everywhere.

674
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,620
- It was happening again.

675
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,090
- Sergeant, can
you play Jay's 911 call

676
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:51,258
again for me?

677
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:55,262
- He's trying to do it
again.

678
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,332
I can't allow it. Not this time.

679
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:01,468
I think I know how to stop him.

680
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:05,272
This is wrong.

681
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:06,440
Shut up!

682
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:07,441
- Stop it there.

683
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:11,111
Can you play that last part
again?

684
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,480
- There was a lot of blood.

685
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:17,351
I tried not to be scared, not to
panic.

686
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:20,955
I remember thinking,

687
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:23,323
I just want to protect my little
brother.

688
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,361
- I think I know to stop
him.

689
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:30,665
This is wrong.

690
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:31,766
Shut up!

691
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,001
- Stop.

692
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:35,068
Did you hear anybody else's
voice?

693
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,940
He sounds like he's
talking to somebody else,

694
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:42,075
but I didn't hear anybody else's
voice.

695
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,378
- He was standing right in front
of me.

696
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:46,948
He was talking to someone.

697
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:53,120
There was a tree, so I
couldn't see who it was.

698
00:50:54,087 --> 00:50:55,623
I just kept moving.

699
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,193
- And listen closely to
the part right before that,

700
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,830
where he says, "This is wrong."

701
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:04,632
Play it again.

702
00:51:07,802 --> 00:51:08,670
- I got closer.

703
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:11,305
I called his name.

704
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:12,774
Jay, can you hear me?

705
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,743
But he was somewhere else.

706
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:18,646
Who are you talking to?

707
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,148
Like when he used to have those
dreams.

708
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:27,722
He was standing there,
staring into the distance.

709
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:32,026
- This is wrong.

710
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,695
Shut up!

711
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:37,765
- And his voice...

712
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:42,003
his voice was different.

713
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,004
- This is wrong.

714
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:44,038
Shut up!

715
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:45,540
- His voice is different.

716
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:48,943
- I don't follow you.

717
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:51,144
- And he finally turned around.

718
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:56,183
I will never forget that look on
his face.

719
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:02,289
It was as if he had never seen
me before.

720
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:03,925
- Listen to
the tone of his voice.

721
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:05,425
It's slightly different.

722
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,896
- There was so
much blood everywhere.

723
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,733
- I think I know how to
stop him.

724
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,003
This is wrong.

725
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:16,236
Shut up!

726
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,905
- I got closer...

727
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:19,807
and closer.

728
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:24,277
And then I saw it.

729
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:27,414
Roy...

730
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,517
the dog...

731
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,754
was there on the floor.

732
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:36,423
He was dead.

733
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,894
I couldn't move.

734
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:41,129
- That is wrong.

735
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:42,429
Shut up!

736
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:44,132
- He's got a slightly different
tone.

737
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:46,801
Sounds like he's he's talking
into the phone, but then...

738
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,402
then it sounds a little more
distant,

739
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:50,138
like he's moved his head
away from the phone,

740
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,140
talking to somebody else in the
room.

741
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:54,542
It's like somebody else could
have said those words before,

742
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,511
even if it wasn't Jay himself.

743
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,582
- There was nobody there.

744
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,753
He was just staring at
another broken mirror.

745
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:08,656
- Come here. Touch it.

746
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:11,491
Touch...

747
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:12,560
it!

748
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:15,096
- He wanted me to touch that
mirror.

749
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:16,664
So I did.

750
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:17,932
- Detective...

751
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:20,333
I think there's something you
should know.

752
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:23,370
- Who are you talking
to?

753
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,906
- I am a friend.

754
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,241
His friend.

755
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,877
- He was not Jay anymore.

756
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:32,113
I asked his name.

757
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:33,280
What's your name?

758
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:34,749
And he said...

759
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,920
Sean.
- Sean.

760
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:41,321
- My name...

761
00:53:43,423 --> 00:53:44,892
is Sean.

762
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,426
- "My name is Sean."

763
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:52,265
- I think I know who Sean is.

764
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:34,374
I'm starting to put the
pieces of the puzzle together.

765
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:40,848
Jay is much more complex
than I ever imagined.

766
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:49,289
He is...

767
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:53,528
someone special.

768
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,570
I've never seen anything like
this before.

769
00:55:08,209 --> 00:55:11,813
Jay is a man that is obsessed.

770
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:15,917
He's constantly fighting

771
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,686
against a barrage of disturbing
thoughts.

772
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:24,025
He might show a lack of
emotion, apathy, loneliness.

773
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,862
But he is...

774
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:32,800
extremely tormented by
something deep and obscure...

775
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,003
in his mind.

776
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:44,545
Whatever happened to him
when he was a young child

777
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:46,914
just destroyed his personality.

778
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,918
Judie was the only thing
keeping him together.

779
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:52,553
Now that she's gone,

780
00:55:52,687 --> 00:55:56,324
he is suddenly experiencing
everything

781
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:58,358
that he's held back for so many
years.

782
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,696
- What has all this to do with
Sean?

783
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:02,697
- A lot.

784
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:05,800
A lot. We need to...

785
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,236
We need to understand
what's going on in his mind

786
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,904
before we go any further.

787
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:15,176
It's important to recognize
him suffering like loneliness

788
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:18,880
or low self-esteem as potential
risk factors for violence.

789
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:22,482
And people like Jay can
target their aggression

790
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:25,219
towards themselves just as
easily as somebody else.

791
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:27,688
- That would explain why he
was trying to kill himself.

792
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:29,724
And the scars on his arms and
face

793
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:31,626
could be self-inflicted too.

794
00:56:33,294 --> 00:56:34,729
- It's possible, yes.

795
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:40,668
Judie recognized that, when Jay
was young,

796
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:44,404
he had what we would
call an imaginary friend.

797
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:50,244
Imaginary friends can
be something positive

798
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:52,313
when you're young; it can
help you deal with something

799
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:55,016
that is an uncomfortable
reality.

800
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,985
But in other cases...

801
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:03,057
they can become pathological...

802
00:57:03,991 --> 00:57:08,162
pushing you to do something very
bad.

803
00:57:10,331 --> 00:57:11,464
- Like murder.

804
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:19,540
- There's something else that
you should know, detective.

805
00:57:22,843 --> 00:57:25,880
The intimate gathering where
they spread Judie's ashes,

806
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,316
I don't remember seeing
Jay there with a man.

807
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,884
As a matter of fact,

808
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,586
I remember him being there with
a woman.

809
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,390
She was off to the side,
smoking away from the people

810
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:38,526
while he was talking to his
mother.

811
00:57:55,242 --> 00:57:57,545
- So who's Sean then?

812
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,180
Just another projection of his
mind?

813
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:02,016
- Probably, but we've gotta
treat him like he's real,

814
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:03,784
just like he is to Jay.

815
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:16,330
What I'm saying, detective,
is...

816
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,904
I don't think Sean is
just an imaginary friend.

817
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:26,073
Not anymore.

818
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:32,546
Somehow, in the last six
months...

819
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,283
he became Sean.

820
00:58:56,904 --> 00:58:58,706
- Can you do something for me?

821
00:59:00,408 --> 00:59:05,312
I know this is hard, but I
want you to look at the body.

822
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,516
- Why?

823
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:09,950
- Please, Jay, tell me what you
see.

824
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:16,624
Jay, please. Do it for me.

825
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:19,794
Tell me exactly what you see.

826
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:31,205
- I see Sean. There's blood
around him.

827
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:33,908
He's laying there...

828
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:36,644
on the floor.

829
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:40,114
- Now look at the face.

830
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,249
- Why are you doing this?

831
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:52,893
- I am sorry.

832
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:55,062
I really am.

833
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:59,033
I know how important he was to
you.

834
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,736
He always was, right?

835
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,939
I was there.

836
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:07,842
I was there with you right
by your side the whole time.

837
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:09,977
Remember?

838
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,680
- After mom's funeral,

839
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:14,381
I started to remember
everything that we've

840
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:16,250
been through in the past.

841
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:18,085
- After mom's funeral, I
started thinking about
everything

842
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,621
that we've been through
together in the past.

843
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:26,260
- There was a moment when
something, everything, changed.

844
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:28,530
- There was a moment
when everything changed.

845
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:30,064
- I guess it might have been

846
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:31,832
when we moved from the country
house...

847
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:32,867
- I guess it was when we
left the country house...

848
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,801
- To the city.

849
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,269
- To move into the city.

850
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:39,340
That night was the
night of Jay's birthday.

851
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:45,913
That night, my mom gave
him the other watch.

852
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:49,483
The one that my dad used to
wear.

853
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:51,752
- It was the
night of your birthday.

854
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:53,654
- It was the
night of your birthday.

855
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:55,389
Do you remember that?

856
01:00:55,524 --> 01:00:56,857
- Mom gave you that watch.

857
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:59,827
- Mom gave you the watch.
Remember?

858
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,229
There's something about that
night that...

859
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:05,332
always stuck in my head.

860
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:10,204
It never left me.

861
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:13,741
- There was something about that
night

862
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:17,111
that I could never get out of my
head.

863
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:18,379
- There was
something about that...

864
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:19,680
- It always stuck with me.

865
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:20,748
- Always stuck to my
head.

866
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,383
- Do you know what it was?

867
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:23,851
- Do you know what it was?

868
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:26,387
It was the look on his face.

869
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,557
It was the look on your face.

870
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,724
It was not just sadness.

871
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:32,159
- It wasn't just
sadness.

872
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:35,095
- It wasn't just sadness
or the move to the city.

873
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,830
- It wasn't that
we were moving to the city.

874
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:38,332
- It wasn't the move to
the city.

875
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,267
It was something...

876
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:41,468
- Something...

877
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:43,103
- Something deeper.

878
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:44,673
- Deeper.

879
01:01:44,805 --> 01:01:45,873
- Something deeper.

880
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,208
Something...

881
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:48,776
Something older.

882
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,377
- Something...

883
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:51,278
older.

884
01:01:51,412 --> 01:01:52,246
- Something older.

885
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:54,516
Tah summer he was sick the whole
time.

886
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:56,651
- You had a fever for weeks.

887
01:01:56,784 --> 01:01:57,985
We couldn't get it under
control.

888
01:01:58,118 --> 01:01:59,787
- And you were crying.

889
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,889
You were crying so much.

890
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:04,124
He was crying so much.

891
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:10,397
And then, after that summer,
I...

892
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,268
I never saw him cry again.

893
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,136
- Then I never saw you
cry again.

894
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:20,908
- And then, after that summer,
I never saw you cry again.

895
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,210
I remember sometimes thinking
that...

896
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:26,981
he probably had no tears left in
his eyes.

897
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,215
- Thought maybe that...

898
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,850
- I used to think
that...

899
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:31,118
- You didn't have any
more tears.

900
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,219
- You probably had no more
tears.

901
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:33,487
He cried them all that summer.

902
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,989
You cried them all that summer.

903
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:39,159
I felt all of his pain just...

904
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,829
I could feel all of you pain.

905
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:44,431
Just by looking at him.

906
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:52,641
And I wanted to carry it.

907
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:54,008
- I wanted to carry that pain.

908
01:02:54,141 --> 01:02:55,442
- I wanted to carry that pain
for you.

909
01:02:55,577 --> 01:02:58,846
- I wanted to carry that pain
for him.

910
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:14,128
I never asked him.

911
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:16,531
I never asked him asked you,
Jay.

912
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:19,333
I never asked him what it was.

913
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,467
- I never...

914
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:24,805
I never asked what it was.

915
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:28,075
What was it?

916
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:29,343
- What was it?

917
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:33,715
- You know, I felt somehow
responsible.

918
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:35,282
- I used to feel somehow
responsible

919
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,719
for not understanding what it
was.

920
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,086
- Don't, please.

921
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:42,890
It had nothing to do with you,
Judie.

922
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:44,892
- I thought he must have been
thinking

923
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,360
about something that...

924
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:51,131
that happened a long time ago.

925
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,605
Something he couldn't remember.

926
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,308
You were probably thinking about
something

927
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:03,310
that happened a long time ago.

928
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:05,747
Something you had forgotten

929
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:08,015
you just remembered that summer.

930
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:11,385
That's probably what made you
sick.

931
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:14,321
- What are you trying to say?

932
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:18,258
- I thought he realized...

933
01:04:20,762 --> 01:04:22,396
what he had done to Roy.

934
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:27,167
- Do you remember Roy, Jay?

935
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,103
- Do you remember Roy?

936
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:30,938
- Roy.

937
01:04:32,906 --> 01:04:34,274
Mother's dog.

938
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:35,510
Yeah.

939
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:36,511
Why?

940
01:04:37,512 --> 01:04:39,647
- Do you remember what happened
to him?

941
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,984
- Yeah, he just left.

942
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:46,019
- Are you sure about that?

943
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:49,724
Think about it.

944
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,458
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

945
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,994
Why are you asking about Roy
now?

946
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:55,530
About that dog?

947
01:04:56,765 --> 01:04:58,132
- Think about it, Jay.

948
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,401
- Try to remember that
weekend when mom came home.

949
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:02,804
- Think about the day when mom
came back from that weekend.

950
01:05:02,936 --> 01:05:04,773
- Remember the dinner that
night?

951
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:05,774
- Think about that dinner.

952
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:22,156
- So, how was your weekend,
sweeties?

953
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:23,957
- Good.

954
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:27,461
- Just good?

955
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:28,763
- Yes, good.

956
01:05:28,897 --> 01:05:30,097
Nothing special.

957
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:35,870
- Huh.

958
01:05:36,003 --> 01:05:38,305
Did she take care of you, baby?

959
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:49,016
- Yes, I did.

960
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:52,654
- Good.

961
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:56,558
So I might go away again next
weekend.

962
01:06:01,529 --> 01:06:03,731
So I'm wondering how long I have
to wait

963
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:07,000
before somebody tells me
what happened to the mirror.

964
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:09,136
- It was my fault.

965
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:15,008
We were playing with the
ball, and I was just clumsy.

966
01:06:16,644 --> 01:06:18,613
Don't pull your sleeves up,
okay?

967
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:30,491
- What happened to your face,
baby?

968
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:39,166
- You did that at school.

969
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,134
You were playing soccer with
your friends

970
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:42,737
and you scratched yourself.

971
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:45,707
Do you remember?

972
01:06:49,544 --> 01:06:53,146
You were at school, playing
soccer with your friends,

973
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,749
and you scratched yourself.

974
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,084
It happened yesterday.

975
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:03,257
He scratched himself at school,

976
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,292
playing soccer with his friends.

977
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:12,232
- Is that what
happened?

978
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:13,935
Are you okay baby?

979
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,369
- It's just a scratch.

980
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:24,712
- Where's Roy?

981
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,920
- Where is Roy? I haven't seen
him yet.

982
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,420
- Did you see him today?

983
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,725
- No. I didn't see him.

984
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:39,994
When I got back from
school, he wasn't here.

985
01:07:40,127 --> 01:07:41,629
- He was here this morning.

986
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,098
- You guys remembered
to close the back door

987
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:47,802
before you left this morning,
right?

988
01:07:50,605 --> 01:07:54,374
You know that Roy cannot be
outside alone.

989
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:59,948
Jay, did you close the door or
not?

990
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,315
I don't know.

991
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,250
- What do you mean you don't
know?

992
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:04,619
- I don't remember.

993
01:08:04,752 --> 01:08:06,621
- What do you mean you don't
remember?

994
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:09,289
It's a simple question.

995
01:08:10,324 --> 01:08:12,727
Did you close the door or not?

996
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:18,398
Jay, did you close the door?

997
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:20,100
- I don't know, Mom.

998
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:21,301
I'm sorry.

999
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,271
- Well, think about it.

1000
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:26,306
Think about it.

1001
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,809
How many times do I have to tell
you

1002
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:29,309
to keep the back door closed?

1003
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,311
It's a simple thing.

1004
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,548
One simple thing.

1005
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:36,718
Is that so much to ask?

1006
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,151
- I did it.

1007
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,024
I did.

1008
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,626
- Did what?

1009
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:46,259
- When I was in the kitchen this
morning,

1010
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:48,563
I heard something outside,

1011
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:50,832
so I went to the backyard to
check.

1012
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:55,603
But it was nothing.

1013
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:00,808
- Nothing?

1014
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:04,646
- Yes, just...

1015
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:06,848
some birds.

1016
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:09,651
- Birds.

1017
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:12,920
- Yes, birds.

1018
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:18,693
But then I stayed there
outside for a while.

1019
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:24,632
Maybe too long.

1020
01:09:31,806 --> 01:09:34,374
I guess I was thinking
about something else.

1021
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:39,914
- Something else? Like what?

1022
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:44,251
- School.

1023
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,624
Something I had to do for
school.

1024
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,697
- Well, I hope you did it right!

1025
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,645
- I think so.

1026
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,380
I think I got it done.

1027
01:10:15,116 --> 01:10:18,318
- Tomorrow, you're gonna
go out and look for Roy,

1028
01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:20,788
and you better find him.

1029
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,525
This was your responsibility,
Judie.

1030
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:28,428
It's all your fault.

1031
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:38,238
- Yeah.

1032
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:40,675
Yeah, I remember.

1033
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,310
- What exactly do you
remember?

1034
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:45,580
- Why do you wanna talk about
that?

1035
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:47,915
- There's something that I need
to know.

1036
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:53,154
- Judie, it was such a long
time ago.

1037
01:10:53,286 --> 01:10:54,922
It was it long time ago, Judie.

1038
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,390
I'm not mad at you.

1039
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:00,561
I'm not upset about him.

1040
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:02,530
- He replaced the actual event

1041
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:04,732
with the lie that Judie
told to protect him.

1042
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:06,667
- Do you still think about it?

1043
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,607
It's not your fault.

1044
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:16,844
It just happened.

1045
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:19,279
You shouldn't blame yourself

1046
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:21,448
just because you left the front
door open.

1047
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:25,153
He was just gone.

1048
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:26,187
- It's all your fault.

1049
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,596
- No, detective, you need to
stop.

1050
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,531
- Hey.

1051
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:37,732
What did you say?

1052
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:43,403
- All of this bullshit.

1053
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,807
How did she do it?

1054
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:50,878
You know what, Jay? I
think it's time to wake up.

1055
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:54,115
Judie, Judie, Judie.

1056
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:55,415
It's all Judie's fault.

1057
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,852
Judie didn't have a life because
of you.

1058
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:03,490
Come on, Jay, wake up.

1059
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,226
- Please stop.

1060
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:06,694
- You know the truth.

1061
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:09,931
You know exactly what
happened to that dog.

1062
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:15,870
You know the reason why you got
sick that summer, don't you?

1063
01:12:16,604 --> 01:12:18,405
You finally remembered what you
did,

1064
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:20,675
and you couldn't take it, right?

1065
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:22,877
You couldn't take it.

1066
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,680
Judie was there all the
time to protect you.

1067
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:29,482
But you never said a word, ever.

1068
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,752
- Not one word!

1069
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:34,021
- Judie.

1070
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:35,056
- Come on, Jay.

1071
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,624
Come on. Tell me.

1072
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,793
Tell me, and yourself,
what you really did?

1073
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,695
- I didn't do anything.

1074
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:42,597
I didn't do anything.

1075
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,032
- You killed your own dog?

1076
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:46,667
- No, He just left.

1077
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,102
- You held him in your arms
while cutting his throat.

1078
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:48,970
- You're lying.

1079
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:50,037
- No, I didn't.

1080
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:52,039
- Did you do the same here, huh?

1081
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,977
- Isn't that what you did here,
Jay?

1082
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:56,978
Isn't it?

1083
01:12:58,279 --> 01:12:59,113
- No.

1084
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:00,014
Is that what you did?

1085
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:01,649
No.

1086
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,988
- Is that what you did?

1087
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,390
- Okay, this may be the moment.

1088
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,226
Ready for my orders.

1089
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:15,529
Go!

1090
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:17,365
- Stay away!

1091
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,138
Stay away from me!

1092
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:30,144
Back off!

1093
01:13:33,514 --> 01:13:34,248
- Detective.

1094
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:35,750
Get back. Clear!

1095
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,685
- Damn Diana,
what are you doing?

1096
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:41,188
Stop. Nobody shoot.

1097
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:43,124
Back off, back off, back off.

1098
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:50,131
- Judie!

1099
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:53,935
Come back here!

1100
01:13:58,539 --> 01:13:59,807
Get her back here.

1101
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:06,781
- Did she follow the
procedure?

1102
01:14:13,254 --> 01:14:14,121
- Fuck off.

1103
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,526
- Officer, I need
you to answer the question.

1104
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,128
Did she follow the procedure?
Yes or no?

1105
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:41,182
- You know it's her fault
you can't remember, right?

1106
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:43,951
Judie.

1107
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,054
She's the one that made
you forget about me.

1108
01:14:48,889 --> 01:14:51,959
That fucking bitch sent me away
from you.

1109
01:14:56,163 --> 01:14:58,165
But now that she's gone.

1110
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:02,937
We can finish what we
started a long time ago.

1111
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:06,240
What are you talking about?

1112
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:13,614
Today's a very important day for
us.

1113
01:15:16,317 --> 01:15:18,753
We can finally fix this.

1114
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:21,288
There's just one thing I need
you to do.

1115
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:25,092
And I've already prepared
everything.

1116
01:15:27,395 --> 01:15:28,963
What did you do?

1117
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:39,874
I called her while you were
sleeping.

1118
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:43,077
I told her that we should meet.

1119
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,783
She's actually on her way here
right now.

1120
01:15:50,284 --> 01:15:52,219
No, I won't do it.

1121
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:53,320
Yes you will.

1122
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:58,459
You know exactly what to
do when she gets here.

1123
01:16:04,265 --> 01:16:05,132
There she is.

1124
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:47,108
- There was someone like him
in your life, am I right?

1125
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:53,714
- It's Judie.

1126
01:16:58,587 --> 01:17:01,655
- You see a lack of strength
on Judie's part, but...

1127
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:04,859
maybe this is a distortion.

1128
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,130
Ask yourself if you're
interpreting what Judie did

1129
01:17:09,263 --> 01:17:11,632
in her life with your own
experience.

1130
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,870
Maybe just can't see what
Judie was really doing.

1131
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:20,941
- No, Dr. Rivers, I can't. What
was it?

1132
01:17:22,743 --> 01:17:24,245
- Love.

1133
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:31,886
Judie was one of the strongest
people

1134
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,787
I'd ever met my whole career.

1135
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:42,029
She made a clear choice that
she maintained her whole life.

1136
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:43,697
She chose to protect her little
brother

1137
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:47,434
from the painful truth, and
she died with Jay's secret.

1138
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:53,007
Isn't that love?

1139
01:17:55,242 --> 01:17:56,410
- Or guilt.

1140
01:17:56,545 --> 01:17:58,846
- Is that easier for you to
relate to?

1141
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:02,116
That sense of guilt?

1142
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:04,185
Is that better for you?

1143
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:11,792
You have a lot more in common
with Judie than you think.

1144
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:14,161
A lot more.

1145
01:18:16,964 --> 01:18:18,567
You can use that.

1146
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:19,833
Use it.

1147
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:20,768
- It's happening
again.

1148
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:22,937
You both need to see this.

1149
01:18:40,522 --> 01:18:41,388
- Jay.

1150
01:18:42,524 --> 01:18:43,558
Can you hear me, Jay?

1151
01:18:43,692 --> 01:18:44,491
- What's going on?

1152
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:45,960
- Wait, don't touch him.

1153
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:49,263
- Why is he
pointing the gun at that door?

1154
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:55,903
- He is not pointing the gun at
the door.

1155
01:18:58,906 --> 01:19:00,874
He's pointing the gun at
himself.

1156
01:19:01,008 --> 01:19:02,176
- Yeah, you're right.

1157
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:04,044
- What are you talking
about?

1158
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,383
- I can see the both of
us through that window.

1159
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,051
- Not following.

1160
01:19:11,185 --> 01:19:14,556
- When we found him here frozen,
pointing a gun to his head,

1161
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,390
he wasn't trying to kill
himself.

1162
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:18,058
He wanted to kill Sean.

1163
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:20,027
- You're right.

1164
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:23,163
The mirrors. That's how he sees
Sean.

1165
01:19:23,297 --> 01:19:26,100
- It's not just the mirrors.
It's the reflections.

1166
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,135
- Yes!

1167
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:30,639
Reflections! The reflected
image of himself.

1168
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,239
- Why didn't he do it before?

1169
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:34,008
And why is he not pulling
the trigger right now?

1170
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:35,809
- No, he's not gonna do that.

1171
01:19:35,943 --> 01:19:37,444
- Why not?

1172
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:41,348
- Because right now he's not
Jay. Right now he's Sean.

1173
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:44,619
- That's why Jay broke all the
mirrors.

1174
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:46,755
He was trying to kill Sean.

1175
01:19:46,887 --> 01:19:48,389
- If Jay wants to kill Sean,

1176
01:19:48,523 --> 01:19:51,526
he has to avoid seeing him,
or else he loses control.

1177
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,861
That's why he broke
every reflective surface,

1178
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:55,896
to keep Sean far away from him.

1179
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:59,099
In order for Jay to kill Sean,

1180
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:03,037
he has to kill himself,
because Sean is a part of him.

1181
01:20:04,071 --> 01:20:05,906
But he didn't count...

1182
01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:08,175
on that door window.

1183
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,546
- Okay? So what do we
do now?

1184
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,015
- What is it?

1185
01:20:20,888 --> 01:20:22,022
It's the light.

1186
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:24,992
It's the light.

1187
01:20:25,694 --> 01:20:26,661
- Yes.

1188
01:20:26,795 --> 01:20:28,228
- When they got on the scene,

1189
01:20:28,362 --> 01:20:30,964
the sun must have been there,
and it lit this window.

1190
01:20:32,933 --> 01:20:34,168
Think about it.

1191
01:20:34,868 --> 01:20:36,604
When the sun hits that window,

1192
01:20:36,738 --> 01:20:39,273
if you are on the other side
of it, you can see through it.

1193
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:41,208
But if you're on the
side with the sunshine,

1194
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:43,611
you can't see the other side at
all.

1195
01:20:43,745 --> 01:20:45,613
And Jay was on this side.

1196
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:50,451
And in this situation-

1197
01:20:50,585 --> 01:20:52,453
- The glass. It acts like a
mirror.

1198
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:53,454
- Exactly.

1199
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:56,256
He could only see his
reflection.

1200
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,926
- He broke every reflective
image of himself in the house,

1201
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,127
but he didn't think it was gonna
happen

1202
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,629
when he walked outside.

1203
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:03,897
- I remember when I got here,

1204
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:06,233
the sun was there, and it was
cloudy,

1205
01:21:06,367 --> 01:21:08,636
so it wasn't hitting that window
anymore.

1206
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:10,871
- And that's why he woke up

1207
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:12,272
when he heard the sound of your
voice,

1208
01:21:12,406 --> 01:21:14,475
because he wasn't Seam anymore.

1209
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:15,577
- Exactly.

1210
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,077
- So what happened.

1211
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:18,513
- When the sun does not
shine through that window,

1212
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:19,913
it's just a window.

1213
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:22,316
He couldn't see his
reflected image anymore.

1214
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:24,451
He was Jay again.

1215
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:25,919
- So what now?

1216
01:21:29,256 --> 01:21:30,891
- There's an overlap.

1217
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:32,393
I can see through the glass,

1218
01:21:32,527 --> 01:21:35,195
but I can also see Jay and
myself at the same time.

1219
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:37,097
- We need to find out where
that light's coming from

1220
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:39,066
that's causing that reflection.

1221
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,402
- There's a street light over
there.

1222
01:21:41,536 --> 01:21:42,503
- No Uh-uh.

1223
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:44,304
It's gotta be closer to our
side.

1224
01:21:44,438 --> 01:21:46,907
- Detective, a few minutes
ago that light turned on.

1225
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:49,744
- It must be an automatic
light that switches on

1226
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:51,445
when the sun comes down.

1227
01:21:51,579 --> 01:21:53,914
We must find the breakers for
that light and turn it off.

1228
01:21:54,047 --> 01:21:55,282
- I will take care of it.

1229
01:22:10,899 --> 01:22:11,900
I found it.

1230
01:22:12,332 --> 01:22:13,601
I am gonna switch it off.

1231
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:19,741
- Sean!

1232
01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:21,341
Sean! Where are you?

1233
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:24,111
- Step back, detective. Don't
touch him.

1234
01:22:24,244 --> 01:22:25,979
Just gimme a minute here.

1235
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:27,181
- Sean!

1236
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,316
Sean, what did you say?

1237
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,586
- He's still asleep, he's still
dreaming,

1238
01:22:31,719 --> 01:22:33,454
but he's not Sean anymore.

1239
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:36,524
He's in between being awake and
dreaming.

1240
01:22:37,324 --> 01:22:41,696
Let's bring Judie in there,
into his unconscious.

1241
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,063
I'll guide you through it.

1242
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:47,334
I just need you to remember
to talk in a low tone,

1243
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:49,970
almost a whisper type of a tone.

1244
01:22:50,103 --> 01:22:51,773
Follow my words,

1245
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:16,430
Jay...

1246
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:19,066
relax.

1247
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:21,803
- Jay, relax.

1248
01:23:21,936 --> 01:23:23,136
- Don't be afraid.

1249
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:25,540
- Don't be afraid.

1250
01:23:25,673 --> 01:23:26,641
- I'm here with you.

1251
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:28,075
- Judie!

1252
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:31,078
Where are you? I can't see you.

1253
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:34,716
- Relax.

1254
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:36,316
Don't be afraid.

1255
01:23:38,586 --> 01:23:41,188
- Jay relax. I'm here with you.

1256
01:23:42,991 --> 01:23:44,759
- Listen to me now.

1257
01:23:44,893 --> 01:23:46,059
- Listen to me now.

1258
01:23:47,461 --> 01:23:49,797
- I want you to close your eyes.

1259
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:54,034
- I want you to close your eyes.

1260
01:23:58,238 --> 01:23:59,306
Trust me.

1261
01:24:00,808 --> 01:24:02,276
Close your eyes.

1262
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:07,381
- You're sitting on a
chair.

1263
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:08,716
- You are sitting on a
chair.

1264
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,317
- And don't know where
you are.

1265
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:11,986
- And you don't
know where you are.

1266
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:13,186
- You can't move.

1267
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:16,991
You're tied up.
- You're tied up.

1268
01:24:17,124 --> 01:24:19,661
You try to break free, but you
can't.

1269
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:21,495
Your body is bound.
- Your body is bound.

1270
01:24:21,629 --> 01:24:22,931
You can't even ask for help.

1271
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:26,133
- But you can't ask for help
either.

1272
01:24:27,635 --> 01:24:29,503
You have rope in your mouth too.

1273
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:32,574
You can't do anything.

1274
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:34,876
- But I found you, Jay.

1275
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:37,144
- But I have found you.

1276
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:39,781
- I'm in front of you.

1277
01:24:39,914 --> 01:24:41,816
- I'm right in front of
you now.

1278
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,718
- You can see me.

1279
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:45,319
- You can see me.

1280
01:24:46,386 --> 01:24:47,789
open your eyes.

1281
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:50,858
Open them.

1282
01:24:50,992 --> 01:24:53,327
- Open your eyes.

1283
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:55,395
Open them.

1284
01:24:57,932 --> 01:24:59,099
I'm here for you.

1285
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:02,904
I'm here for you.

1286
01:25:03,037 --> 01:25:04,539
I'm here to help.

1287
01:25:05,673 --> 01:25:08,876
- I'm gonna take that
rope out of your mouth

1288
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,812
so you can talk to me.

1289
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:12,279
- I'm coming closer.

1290
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:16,483
I'm touching the rope now.
- I'm touching the rope now.

1291
01:25:17,518 --> 01:25:18,452
- It's tight.

1292
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:19,754
- I know it's tight.

1293
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:21,689
- But I'm loosening the knots
now.

1294
01:25:22,991 --> 01:25:23,925
- Almost there.

1295
01:25:24,058 --> 01:25:25,359
- Can you feel it?

1296
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,394
- Almost done?

1297
01:25:28,195 --> 01:25:33,266
- You can feel that the
rope's not so tight anymore.

1298
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,837
- Almost there.

1299
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:36,904
Here we go.

1300
01:25:39,007 --> 01:25:41,109
Your mouth is free now.
- Your mouth is free now.

1301
01:25:56,691 --> 01:25:57,625
- Judie

1302
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:18,613
- Where are you, Jay?

1303
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:20,615
What do you see?

1304
01:26:20,748 --> 01:26:22,083
- The dog.

1305
01:26:22,215 --> 01:26:23,350
He's angry.

1306
01:26:24,317 --> 01:26:25,820
He's always so angry.

1307
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:27,354
- Don't be afraid, Jay.

1308
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,624
- He's not mad at you.

1309
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:31,726
He's trying to tell you
something.

1310
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,428
Something you need

1311
01:26:34,562 --> 01:26:36,329
to remember.
- Remember.

1312
01:26:36,463 --> 01:26:38,298
- Jay, just look at him.

1313
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:40,333
- Look at him deeply in the
eyes.

1314
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:45,907
- What do you feel?
- What do you feel?

1315
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,407
- What's in my stomach?

1316
01:26:48,109 --> 01:26:49,276
I can't move.

1317
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:51,946
It's dark, dirty.

1318
01:26:54,115 --> 01:26:54,982
It's wrong.

1319
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:57,350
It's consuming me.

1320
01:26:58,285 --> 01:26:59,386
- It's okay, Jay.

1321
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:02,657
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

1322
01:27:04,257 --> 01:27:07,528
You're just feeling guilty
for something you did,

1323
01:27:07,662 --> 01:27:10,665
for something bad you did to
that dog.

1324
01:27:10,798 --> 01:27:11,331
- Remember?

1325
01:27:11,465 --> 01:27:12,800
- Is it Roy?

1326
01:27:13,668 --> 01:27:15,636
- What happened to Roy, Jay?

1327
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:19,406
- Roy didn't just leave us.

1328
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,943
- I didn't
leave the door open, Jay.

1329
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:23,845
- Remember?

1330
01:27:29,316 --> 01:27:31,018
What do you see now?

1331
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:34,655
- I see myself.

1332
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:39,961
I'm in the house.

1333
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:42,930
The country house.

1334
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:44,932
And I'm young

1335
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:58,012
Roy is there too.

1336
01:27:58,146 --> 01:27:59,814
- What is he doing?

1337
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:02,550
- Eating.

1338
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,526
- What do you see now?

1339
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:13,761
- I'm in the kitchen.

1340
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:17,865
And that kid's there.

1341
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:22,335
- What kid?

1342
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:25,273
- The one I always see in my
dreams.

1343
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:27,809
He wears a mask on his face,

1344
01:28:28,843 --> 01:28:30,477
but only on the left side.

1345
01:28:34,347 --> 01:28:35,850
- You know the kid, Jay.

1346
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:38,318
Think about it.

1347
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:44,424
Think about when you were young.

1348
01:28:44,559 --> 01:28:48,395
- Jay, what do you see now?

1349
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:51,766
- Blood.

1350
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:35,743
- Jay...

1351
01:29:36,611 --> 01:29:37,979
what do you see?

1352
01:29:41,682 --> 01:29:43,084
- Did you see?

1353
01:29:44,819 --> 01:29:48,556
- You did
good, Jay.

1354
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:50,157
- Jay...

1355
01:29:52,193 --> 01:29:53,393
talk to me.

1356
01:29:56,631 --> 01:29:58,165
What did you see?

1357
01:30:02,502 --> 01:30:03,671
- I remember now.

1358
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:06,607
I remember.

1359
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:11,979
It was me.

1360
01:30:14,548 --> 01:30:15,883
- Know, it's hard to see.

1361
01:30:16,817 --> 01:30:19,587
you did a terrible thing to that
dog.

1362
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:23,991
There was a reason why you did
it, Jay.

1363
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:28,062
- He told me to do it.

1364
01:30:28,195 --> 01:30:29,063
That kid.

1365
01:30:30,131 --> 01:30:31,999
This is what she deserved.

1366
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:34,869
- He said it was what she
deserved?

1367
01:30:35,002 --> 01:30:35,870
- Who?

1368
01:30:37,504 --> 01:30:39,507
What did she deserve.

1369
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:42,743
- Your
mother.

1370
01:30:42,877 --> 01:30:46,180
She has to pay for what she did
to me.

1371
01:30:46,314 --> 01:30:47,515
- My mother.

1372
01:30:49,951 --> 01:30:52,219
I don't know why he said that.

1373
01:30:54,088 --> 01:30:55,623
- Who is he, Jay?

1374
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:58,025
Who is the kid?

1375
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,093
- A friend.

1376
01:31:01,295 --> 01:31:03,197
But he had to go away.

1377
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:04,198
Because...

1378
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:08,501
Because of you.

1379
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,639
Because of you, Judie.

1380
01:31:12,373 --> 01:31:14,775
You wanted him to leave.

1381
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:17,311
Told him to go away.

1382
01:31:17,445 --> 01:31:18,813
I remember now.

1383
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:25,820
- Jay...

1384
01:31:25,953 --> 01:31:27,588
now I want you to remember your
birthday,

1385
01:31:27,722 --> 01:31:29,090
the night of your birthday.

1386
01:31:29,223 --> 01:31:31,625
- When we left the country
house to go to the city.

1387
01:31:31,759 --> 01:31:33,160
- We were in the car.

1388
01:31:33,294 --> 01:31:34,562
- Remember.

1389
01:31:36,797 --> 01:31:38,666
- What do you see now,
Jay?

1390
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,036
- The watch.

1391
01:31:44,171 --> 01:31:45,539
- Where are you.

1392
01:31:47,842 --> 01:31:48,943
- In the car.

1393
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:52,747
You're there.

1394
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,049
You're young.

1395
01:31:57,284 --> 01:31:58,152
Mom's driving.

1396
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:03,958
I see myself right there next to
me.

1397
01:32:04,825 --> 01:32:06,560
- You...

1398
01:32:07,294 --> 01:32:08,963
cried a lot that summer.

1399
01:32:11,265 --> 01:32:12,266
- You couldn't stop.

1400
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:15,236
- I remember.

1401
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:19,273
- Was it because you
realized that you killed Roy?

1402
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:21,909
- No.

1403
01:32:22,877 --> 01:32:24,779
It was something else.

1404
01:32:26,614 --> 01:32:28,616
- What was it?

1405
01:32:28,749 --> 01:32:31,852
- Something happened
that I can't understand.

1406
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:34,155
I did something I wasn't
supposed to.

1407
01:32:36,657 --> 01:32:37,958
Something wrong.

1408
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:43,164
I don't know why. But
I'm not a child anymore.

1409
01:32:45,032 --> 01:32:46,767
I shouldn't have done it.

1410
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:49,103
- What did you do?

1411
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:55,076
- I can't see what it is, but
it's still deep inside me...

1412
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:58,079
destroying my soul.

1413
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,649
Even if the memory's gone.

1414
01:33:01,782 --> 01:33:03,884
- What are you thinking
about?

1415
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:10,925
- This watch makes me feel
dirty.

1416
01:33:13,294 --> 01:33:15,930
Like my body doesn't exist
anymore.

1417
01:33:18,232 --> 01:33:19,100
I feel violated.

1418
01:33:22,203 --> 01:33:25,039
- That night, my mom
gave him the other watch,

1419
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:26,907
the one my dad used to wear.

1420
01:33:28,543 --> 01:33:31,846
- Why do you think the watch
makes you feel that way?

1421
01:33:33,414 --> 01:33:34,281
- Jay.

1422
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:37,118
Jay.

1423
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:38,152
- Jay, talk to me.

1424
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:43,757
Who gave you that watch?

1425
01:33:49,964 --> 01:33:51,932
- Why did you say that?

1426
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,168
- What?

1427
01:33:55,703 --> 01:33:57,104
What did I say?

1428
01:33:58,573 --> 01:34:00,107
I know you don't get it now.

1429
01:34:00,241 --> 01:34:02,209
But trust me, you need to hear
this.

1430
01:34:05,246 --> 01:34:08,782
You need to get away from Mom,
Jay.

1431
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:12,786
- You told me I should stay away
from Mom.

1432
01:34:14,788 --> 01:34:16,957
You told me to stay away from
her.

1433
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:19,927
You wanted me to leave.

1434
01:34:22,263 --> 01:34:25,099
- He made two watches that look
alike.

1435
01:34:26,367 --> 01:34:28,235
And now Jay had one...

1436
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:31,705
so my Mom could feel connected
with him.

1437
01:34:37,111 --> 01:34:37,978
Jay...

1438
01:34:43,984 --> 01:34:46,053
Jay, I want you to close your
eyes now.

1439
01:34:46,187 --> 01:34:47,688
- What are you doing?

1440
01:34:47,821 --> 01:34:49,023
- Trust me.

1441
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:50,391
- Oh, no, no, no.
Detective.

1442
01:34:50,525 --> 01:34:51,792
- Close your eyes.

1443
01:34:51,926 --> 01:34:53,260
- Stop doing what you're doing
right now.

1444
01:34:53,394 --> 01:34:54,728
This is very dangerous.

1445
01:34:56,063 --> 01:34:58,933
- You are sitting on a chair.

1446
01:34:59,066 --> 01:35:01,035
You can't move. You're tied up.

1447
01:35:01,168 --> 01:35:05,439
You're trying to break
free, but you can't.

1448
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:07,942
Your body is bound.

1449
01:35:09,343 --> 01:35:11,712
But you can't ask for help
either.

1450
01:35:11,845 --> 01:35:13,380
But I have found you.

1451
01:35:13,515 --> 01:35:16,450
I'm right in front of you. You
can see me.

1452
01:35:16,585 --> 01:35:17,484
- Open your eyes.

1453
01:35:24,225 --> 01:35:26,695
I'm going take these ropes off
of you

1454
01:35:26,827 --> 01:35:28,395
so you can finally move.

1455
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:31,131
I'm touching the rope now.

1456
01:35:32,466 --> 01:35:33,934
Untying the not.

1457
01:35:35,202 --> 01:35:37,738
You can feel that it's
not so tight anymore.

1458
01:35:40,274 --> 01:35:42,977
- I am almost done, Jay. Almost
there.

1459
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:45,779
- Almost there, Jay.

1460
01:35:56,658 --> 01:35:57,858
You're free.

1461
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:01,161
You can move now.

1462
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:22,449
I'm sorry.

1463
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,821
Please forgive me, Jay.

1464
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:31,959
I could have said something.

1465
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:34,428
I didn't though.

1466
01:36:36,765 --> 01:36:37,865
I never did.

1467
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:42,803
It was her.

1468
01:36:45,172 --> 01:36:47,509
That's why you killed Roy.

1469
01:36:51,879 --> 01:36:56,884
You wanted to punish her for
what she had done to you.

1470
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:01,989
That's why you felt violated and
dirty.

1471
01:37:05,893 --> 01:37:07,529
She seduced you.

1472
01:37:09,129 --> 01:37:12,232
God, you were just a kid.

1473
01:37:14,268 --> 01:37:15,637
You loved your mother,

1474
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:21,241
but there's another part
that knew that it was wrong.

1475
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:25,446
There's another part in
you that rejected it.

1476
01:37:26,213 --> 01:37:28,916
Part of you even hated
your mother for all of it.

1477
01:37:29,049 --> 01:37:31,185
- No, it was that kid.

1478
01:37:31,885 --> 01:37:32,953
It wasn't me.

1479
01:37:34,288 --> 01:37:35,956
- You told me he was wearing a
mask

1480
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,593
on the left side of his face,
right?

1481
01:37:39,293 --> 01:37:40,928
What about the other side?

1482
01:37:42,229 --> 01:37:45,633
- The other side, he had...

1483
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,401
He had a scar.

1484
01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:50,070
- Where did he have the scar?

1485
01:37:51,673 --> 01:37:52,906
- Under his eye.

1486
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,075
- Under his right eye.

1487
01:37:56,544 --> 01:37:57,478
- Yeah.

1488
01:37:57,612 --> 01:37:58,680
- What else, Jay?

1489
01:37:58,813 --> 01:37:59,880
- His arm.

1490
01:38:01,816 --> 01:38:03,083
Roy hurt him.

1491
01:38:04,985 --> 01:38:07,121
- Did he have dog bites on his
arm?

1492
01:38:09,557 --> 01:38:10,625
- Yeah.

1493
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:13,661
- Look at your arm, Jay.

1494
01:38:14,962 --> 01:38:16,096
Look at it.

1495
01:38:18,566 --> 01:38:22,369
That's your right arm. Your left
arm, Jay.

1496
01:38:24,972 --> 01:38:26,039
What do you see?

1497
01:38:30,144 --> 01:38:32,312
- I don't understand.

1498
01:38:32,446 --> 01:38:35,015
- And you have a cut
under your left eye too.

1499
01:38:35,817 --> 01:38:36,684
Jay...

1500
01:38:37,652 --> 01:38:38,620
who is Sean?

1501
01:38:46,093 --> 01:38:47,862
- How dare you...

1502
01:38:47,995 --> 01:38:50,164
bring one of your sluts here?

1503
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:53,535
Do you have no respect for your
sister?

1504
01:38:57,672 --> 01:38:58,606
- You want a smoke?

1505
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:01,743
- Oh, no thanks. I don't smoke.

1506
01:39:01,876 --> 01:39:05,245
- You don't have to be shy.
You can go smoke if you want.

1507
01:39:06,146 --> 01:39:07,314
- No, Jay.

1508
01:39:08,015 --> 01:39:09,517
I don't smoke.

1509
01:39:09,651 --> 01:39:10,618
I never did.

1510
01:39:10,752 --> 01:39:12,520
- You know what she's
like.

1511
01:39:14,889 --> 01:39:16,089
- No.

1512
01:39:16,223 --> 01:39:18,492
- Jay, seriously, how can I know
that?

1513
01:39:20,762 --> 01:39:22,062
- Do you know her?

1514
01:39:22,196 --> 01:39:24,364
- No, I don't know her.
She's just staring.

1515
01:39:28,368 --> 01:39:33,474
- You've become
distant, aggressive.

1516
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:35,710
Mean.

1517
01:39:37,612 --> 01:39:40,214
- Goodbye, Jay. Take care of
yourself.

1518
01:39:46,386 --> 01:39:48,690
- Who the fuck was that?

1519
01:39:48,823 --> 01:39:51,325
What kind of asshole are you
to pretend you don't know me?

1520
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,360
- I only came here for one
thing.

1521
01:39:55,663 --> 01:40:00,267
This piece of shit belongs to
you, to your fucking family!

1522
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,302
- And what about
your Sean? Your boyfriend?

1523
01:40:02,436 --> 01:40:04,037
- I don't want anything more
from you, you sick fuck!

1524
01:40:04,171 --> 01:40:05,773
- What about his arm?

1525
01:40:07,007 --> 01:40:08,108
- They were cigarette
burns.

1526
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:09,243
- Congrats.

1527
01:40:10,444 --> 01:40:12,212
- How did he get those?

1528
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:16,416
- I don't know.

1529
01:40:16,551 --> 01:40:18,452
- Was it on his right
arm?

1530
01:40:20,287 --> 01:40:22,524
- Yeah, the right arm.

1531
01:40:25,492 --> 01:40:27,127
- Did he have a scar
too?

1532
01:40:27,261 --> 01:40:28,462
- Yeah, he did.

1533
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:30,798
- Under his right eye?

1534
01:40:32,165 --> 01:40:33,433
- The right eye.

1535
01:40:36,136 --> 01:40:38,372
- Jay, the kid...

1536
01:40:39,172 --> 01:40:40,909
that kid that was in your house,

1537
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:44,746
that same kid from your dreams,
Sean...

1538
01:40:46,814 --> 01:40:48,616
you can't see the left side of
face

1539
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:50,818
because you don't want to see
it.

1540
01:40:54,689 --> 01:40:57,025
You can't see what's under the
mask

1541
01:40:57,157 --> 01:40:58,760
because you don't want to.

1542
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:03,598
But it's time now, Jay.

1543
01:41:05,867 --> 01:41:07,735
It's time for you to see...

1544
01:41:09,704 --> 01:41:11,305
there is no mask.

1545
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:16,209
That's what you needed to see,
Jay.

1546
01:41:17,344 --> 01:41:18,813
- What are you talking about?

1547
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:21,749
- To protect yourself from
what you are experiencing.

1548
01:41:22,617 --> 01:41:25,787
To pretend that it
wasn't happening to you.

1549
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,556
The kids' scar was your wound,

1550
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:33,661
but you saw it on the right
side because of the mirrors.

1551
01:41:34,662 --> 01:41:38,131
- Every time we're this room,
I'm gonna call you Sean.

1552
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:40,835
- The mirrors, Jay.

1553
01:41:42,302 --> 01:41:44,304
Your reflected image.

1554
01:41:52,245 --> 01:41:55,182
You're looking at yourself, Jay.

1555
01:41:59,186 --> 01:42:00,755
You...

1556
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:01,756
Are Sean.

1557
01:42:08,195 --> 01:42:09,262
- No.

1558
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:11,833
It can't be true.

1559
01:42:13,034 --> 01:42:13,901
It can't.

1560
01:42:17,105 --> 01:42:18,338
If I'm Sean...

1561
01:42:20,407 --> 01:42:21,475
who's in there?

1562
01:42:22,442 --> 01:42:23,578
Who's in there?

1563
01:42:24,277 --> 01:42:25,345
- Jay...

1564
01:42:27,982 --> 01:42:29,517
do you know who I am?

1565
01:42:29,651 --> 01:42:30,785
- Judie?

1566
01:42:30,918 --> 01:42:32,086
Yeah, I know who you.

1567
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:32,954
- Where is Judie?

1568
01:42:33,087 --> 01:42:34,856
- You're Judie!

1569
01:42:34,989 --> 01:42:36,991
- Where's your sister, Jay?

1570
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:38,526
- Maybe it wasn't the best idea

1571
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,460
to introduce me at your sister's
funeral.

1572
01:42:40,595 --> 01:42:43,330
- What are you talking about?

1573
01:42:45,465 --> 01:42:46,801
- Where is your mother?

1574
01:42:51,906 --> 01:42:52,907
- My Mom?

1575
01:42:56,611 --> 01:42:59,747
- Jay, look at me. Please, look
at me.

1576
01:42:59,881 --> 01:43:00,615
Look at me.

1577
01:43:00,748 --> 01:43:01,983
- No, no.

1578
01:43:02,116 --> 01:43:03,785
- Who has the other watch?

1579
01:43:05,787 --> 01:43:09,222
You're wearing the watch
right now, the same watch.

1580
01:43:11,592 --> 01:43:13,326
And Sean is not here.

1581
01:43:17,264 --> 01:43:19,366
There are two watches, remember?

1582
01:43:20,267 --> 01:43:21,836
And that body on the floor...

1583
01:43:23,336 --> 01:43:24,939
is wearing the same watch.

1584
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:35,482
If you are wearing one of
them...

1585
01:43:41,089 --> 01:43:42,957
who has the other one?

1586
01:44:31,839 --> 01:44:33,373
- Who are you?

1587
01:44:35,977 --> 01:44:37,512
- Diana.

1588
01:44:40,982 --> 01:44:42,650
- My name is Diana.

1589
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:48,022
It's time to go, Jay.

1590
01:44:50,024 --> 01:44:54,028
I'm going to take the
gun from you now, okay?

1591
01:45:05,573 --> 01:45:06,841
It's okay. It's okay.

1592
01:45:06,974 --> 01:45:09,043
Nothing's happened. Nothing's
happened.

1593
01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:12,079
I just need to take the gun
from you now, all right?

1594
01:45:16,651 --> 01:45:18,451
- I know who I am.

1595
01:45:20,353 --> 01:45:21,722
I know what I've done.

1596
01:45:22,557 --> 01:45:25,458
I know what I'll see if I turn
around.

1597
01:45:27,628 --> 01:45:29,462
- So don't.

1598
01:45:29,597 --> 01:45:31,431
Don't turn around, okay?

1599
01:45:32,633 --> 01:45:34,702
We'll figure this out.

1600
01:45:35,803 --> 01:45:38,306
We'll figure this out.

1601
01:45:38,438 --> 01:45:39,640
You don't have to turn around.

1602
01:45:39,774 --> 01:45:42,109
- He'll never leave me, Diana.

1603
01:45:42,243 --> 01:45:43,376
- That's not true.

1604
01:45:44,045 --> 01:45:44,912
That's not true.

1605
01:45:47,281 --> 01:45:48,950
- I killed my own mother.

1606
01:45:51,586 --> 01:45:53,754
How am I supposed to live with
that?

1607
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:58,491
Can you imagine what
it's like to look around

1608
01:46:00,161 --> 01:46:03,865
and realize everything you
see isn't actually there?

1609
01:46:07,802 --> 01:46:12,807
- This thing that happened
to you, it is not your fault.

1610
01:46:15,543 --> 01:46:17,444
We can fix this.

1611
01:46:17,578 --> 01:46:19,847
- Do you see that mirror?

1612
01:46:23,784 --> 01:46:25,553
Can you fix that, Diana?

1613
01:46:34,695 --> 01:46:36,564
Some things are too broken.

1614
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:40,500
You can try to put the
pieces back together,

1615
01:46:40,635 --> 01:46:43,804
but they're never gonna be the
same.

1616
01:46:46,307 --> 01:46:49,176
They're just gonna be
fragments of something broken,

1617
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:52,013
trying to be whole.

1618
01:46:55,049 --> 01:46:57,518
It's time to face the
consequences.

1619
01:46:58,653 --> 01:47:00,655
- Wait, Jay. Please don't

1620
01:47:00,788 --> 01:47:03,925
Please, Jay, don't do it. Don't
do this.

1621
01:47:04,058 --> 01:47:04,926
Please.

1622
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:07,628
Listen, Sean...

1623
01:47:07,762 --> 01:47:10,097
Sean will not let you do this.

1624
01:47:15,269 --> 01:47:17,071
Please don't do this.

1625
01:47:18,539 --> 01:47:20,007
- It's different this time.

1626
01:47:21,609 --> 01:47:23,811
He can't control me anymore.

1627
01:47:25,179 --> 01:47:29,183
Thank you for showing me
the most important thing.

1628
01:47:30,584 --> 01:47:31,652
The truth.

1629
01:47:38,392 --> 01:47:39,627
I am Sean.

1630
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:02,583
- Did you try to stop
him?

1631
01:48:08,022 --> 01:48:11,225
Answer the question.
Did you try to stop him?

1632
01:48:39,353 --> 01:48:41,889
Did she follow the procedure?

1633
01:48:52,133 --> 01:48:54,201
Officer, I need you to
answer the question.

1634
01:48:54,335 --> 01:48:56,971
Did she follow the procedure?
Yes or no?

1635
01:49:08,215 --> 01:49:09,083
- Yes.

1636
01:49:12,286 --> 01:49:15,689
- She did everything that she
could.

1637
01:49:36,644 --> 01:49:37,711
- She did.
