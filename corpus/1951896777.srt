Miss Burke. Wow, what happened to her?

Oh, man, I'm really not in the mood,
Miss Burke. I'm clean.

- [ Girl ] What's up with her?
- Not today.

676
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,160
It's too damn hot, and I got
zero-fucking-tolerance.

677
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,760
Eat me, you asshole. I'm the one with
no tolerance, you pathetic little runt.

678
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,680
Ouch. Comeback.

What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call my mother?

680
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,320
And how am I supposed to do
that, little Zekey boy?

681

Do you even know
where she is?

682
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,320
Europe, Sri Lanka, Japan? I wonder what
remote location she went to this week...

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,560
to hide from her
great big bastard mistake.

- Whoa. Woman, what are you on?
- "Woman"? Did you just say, "woman"?

687
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,880
I'm sick of you,

688

your wonder dust again,

And then they chased us,
but we got away.

All this started when Mrs Brummel
did a wet and wild...

- in the boys' locker room?
- [ Casey ] I think so.

697
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,160
Everybody's been acting really strange,
especially the faculty.

698

Tell me about it. It's like they've
all turned into fucking pod people...

- or something.
- Into what people?

700
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,040
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A small town was taken over by aliens.

701
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,520
That was a joke.

702
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,920
Look, what if it
really happened?

703
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,720
- What if that really happened?
- I think something's
taking over our school.

704
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,440
The Body Snatchers is a story
somebody made up, dingus.

705

It's located in the fiction
section of the library.

So is Schindler's List. All fiction
is based on some truth, right?

in English 101? Write what you know.

How do we know
this writer guy...

709

- Jack Finney.
- didn't encounter aliens
in his high school...

710
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,560
which led him to write a book
about an alien invasion?

711
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,800
- Your conspiracy theory is flawed.
- How so?

712
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,320
Jack Finney's The Body Snatchers
is a blatant rip-off...

713
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,240
of The Puppet Masters
by Robert Heinlein.

714
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,480
So you can completely disregard
that entire work.

715
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
Whatever.
The point is they're here,

716

been racked into the flagpole
one too many times.

Look, how do you know
there's not a conspiracy?

719
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,800
Maybe X-Files is right.

Where do all these movies
come from anyway?

visited by aliens?

723
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,640
You know, maybe they're
aliens themselves.

724
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,000
Maybe they're simply preparing us
for what's to come.

725

You know what, Casey,
it's fiction. Okay?

- It's science fiction.
- Exactly.

Everybody gets hung up on the science
part, which has nothing to do with it.

They're getting at us
through the fiction.

setting us up over the years,

with their E.T.
and their Men ln Black movies...

732
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,400

if it really happened?

Yeah.

they were pods, but where are they?

I mean, where are the pods?

There are no pods.
