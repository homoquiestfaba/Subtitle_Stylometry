1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,433
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,033
(explosions)

3
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,800
(alarm clock rings)

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,733
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,100
- [Josh] My name is Josh Kirby.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,467
I was just your
 average ninth grader,

7
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:30,000
my biggest problem was
 getting good grades.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
And my idea of excitement
 was racing my bicycle.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,033
(bell rings)

10
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,600
Yes!

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,233
I never thought time
would catch up with me.

12
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,500
I couldn't even imagine

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
that hundreds of years from now,

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,300
many kind would
 invent the Nullifier.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,767
A device capable of controlling,

16
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,833
or destroying the universe.

17
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,933
- [Zoetrope] Prepare
 for the storm.

18
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,800
- [Josh] A scientist
 name Erwin 1138

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,667
tried to disassemble
and hide the Nullifier.

20
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,067
Even he he couldn't stop,

21
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,800
- [Irwin] Dr Zoetrope?

22
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:06,767
- [Zoetrope] Give
 me the Nullifier.

23
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,500
- [Irwin] You're
 too late, Zoetrope.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,767
- [Zoetrope] It's
 never too late for me.

25
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,600
- [Josh] Irwin and Zoetrope
 have been chasing each

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,567
other across the time stream,

27
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:18,767
trying to be the first to
 find the Nullifier's pieces.

28
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:21,967
This time, they
 will land in 1995.

29
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,367
The place?

30
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,367
My front yard.

31
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:29,200
Now, I'm going along for
the ride of all time.

32
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,233
What's going on?

33
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,633
Where are we?

34
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,967
- [Irwin] I hope you're
prepared to do battle young man.

35
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,067
This will be a war through time,

36
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,300
and Dr Zoetrope will
 take no prisoners.

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,067
(dramatic music)

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,200
- [Josh] We've got
 help from a warrior.

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

40
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
- Oh, she's amazing.

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,600
And a magical creature called
 Prism to show us the way.

42
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,800
Together, we're on a
 quest through time.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,233
Visiting different worlds

44
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:04,600
to fight for the
 Nullifier's pieces.

45
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,867
- [Zoetrope] I'm obviously
 in the right place.

46
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:08,433
And the right time.

47
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,400
- [Josh] Because if Zoetrope
 ever assembles the Nullifier,

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,300
he'll conquer time it's self.

49
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,500
I've got to try and
 save the universe.

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,267
(dramatic music)

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,400
I was just a 14 year old kid
 before my adventure began.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,567
But now, I'm Josh
 Kirby, Time Warrior.

53
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,267
- [Announcer] On the last
 chapter of Josh Kirby,

54
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,367
Time Warrior.

55
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,733
(yelling)

56
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,567
- Look mister, I've
got to get out of here.

57
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,067
- Such petty concerns.

58
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:44,067
I've got to catch Zoetrope
 before it's too late.

59
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,400
Location is, England.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,233
1205 AD.

61
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,867
You think they mean us harm?

62
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,133
- I'd say that's pretty
much an affirmative.

63
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,633
- It's a dinosaur.

64
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,700
- I think it thinks we're lunch.

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,333
- We must rescue them.

66
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,700
- Who are you guys?

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,567
- I might ask you
 the same question.

68
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,700
(smack)

69
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,933
- Azabeth.

70
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,533
- No, we must run now
boy, or we are lost too.

71
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,567
- Take her.

72
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,567
- New comers, Lord?

73
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,233
- Yes, three of them.

74
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,267
I have one imprisoned in
the dungeon right now.

75
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,533
- We got to organize
 another rescue pronto.

76
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:15,900
- Rescue?

77
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
Out of the question.

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,433
- I know where there's
 another dragon.

79
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,967
- [Josh] Another
dragon, are you serious?

80
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:24,067
- It followed you, Josh.

81
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,800
- [Josh] Maybe now you'll
 consider my other idea.

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
- We should launch an
 assault against the castle

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,367
and my brother with the
aide of this creature?

84
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,200
- We could take 'em.

85
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,433
I know we could.

86
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,500
- Are you with me in a
push against the castle?

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
(crowd clamors agreement)

88
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,567
(dramatic music)

89
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,400
- Guards!

90
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,067
Guards!

91
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,933
Court yard, you idiots.

92
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:51,300
(dramatic music)

93
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,900
(sword clanks)

94
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,933
- Return her to the dungeon.

95
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,267
(struggling)

96
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,900
Wake the royal executioner.

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,800
She dies on the chopping
block in the morning.

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,267
- [Guard] Why not feed her
 to the royal dragon, sire?

99
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,100
- What?

100
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,467
And deny myself the
 trophy of her head?

101
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,267
You see, this is
 why I'm a Barron,

102
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,733
and you're an idiot.

103
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,300
Besides, come tomorrow
 the royal dragon can fest

104
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,667
on all the peasant
 villager he likes.

105
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,067
After her execution,
 we sack the village.

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,700
No more Mr Nice Knight.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,933
(grunting)

108
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,833
(door clangs shut)

109
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,300
- Try the left.

110
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,767
(laughter)

111
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,167
And try the right.

112
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,833
(metal groans)

113
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,067
Excellent.

114
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,833
Time pod in full working order.

115
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,133
- Great.

116
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,267
Now I'll see you later.

117
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,167
I got to talk to
William about something.

118
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,333
- Oh, alright.

119
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,800
(singing to self)

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,933
(sighs)

121
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,433
(light music)

122
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,067
- Sire, it's me, Josh.

123
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,667
(door squeaks open)

124
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,167
- Sire now, is it?

125
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,300
I'm glad you've
 come, Josh Kirby.

126
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,267
I want to tank you.

127
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:31,767
- For what?

128
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,200
- Modest as well as brave, eh?

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I think you know what for.

130
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,533
I was practically a broken
 man before you came.

131
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,667
You've given us all new hope,

132
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,600
- Well actually I came
here to ask you a favor.

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
- Anything in my power, lad.

134
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,200
- I need a sword for tomorrow.

135
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,967
And a few lessons.

136
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,167
- Tomorrows battle
 is not yours, Josh.

137
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,400
We can not ask you
 to fight it for us.

138
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,833
- Yeah but I want too.

139
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,600
Our friend is still your
 brother's prisoner, remember?

140
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,433
(sorrowful music)

141
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:08,667
- Alright.

142
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,867
- It's yours.

143
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,900
- And now yours.

144
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,700
Take it.

145
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,900
(uplifting music)

146
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:28,067
Feels good, doesn't it?

147
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,167
- Yeah, real D&D.

148
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,467
- What?

149
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,700
- D&D.

150
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,433
Dungeons and Dragons?

151
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,067
- Dungeons, dragons?

152
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:40,467
- Skip it.

153
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,667
- That sword was forged in
 the time of the Vikings,

154
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,100
and handed down in my
family for generations.

155
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,233
From eldest son to eldest son.

156
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:57,067
Henry hated my father
 for giving it to me.

157
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:01,167
The Norsemen gave their
 weapons names in those days.

158
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,233
You're holding Salvation
 of the Realm in your hands.

159
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:08,400
Appropriate, wouldn't you say?

160
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,233
Now.

161
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,600
Come at me with your blade.

162
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,533
Oh my.

163
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:20,933
Again.

164
00:10:20,933 --> 00:10:22,100
The other way.

165
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:26,033
(upbeat music)

166
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,367
Oh dear.

167
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,367
And again.

168
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,733
Oh, are you sure you've never
 used a broad sword before?

169
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,567
You seem to have a flare
for this, Josh Kirby.

170
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,733
Yes, quite a flare.

171
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,367
Very interesting maneuver, that.

172
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:03,067
(solemn music)

173
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,700
- Feels good.

174
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,100
Familiar somehow.

175
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,967
Like I've done this before.

176
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,133
- In another life perhaps.

177
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,500
Just a word of caution.

178
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,733
You have a stomach
 for the site of blood?

179
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:15,567
- Blood?

180
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,867
- I thought not.

181
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,600
Many's the knight
 who's been unmanned

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,733
after drawing the
 blood of his enemy.

183
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:26,133
Some even give up
 their breakfasts,

184
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,800
if you take my meaning.

185
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,400
So, if you don't have
the stomach for carnage,

186
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,233
strike to dull the senses.

187
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,900
A blow to the skull with
the flat of your blade

188
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,133
is enough to take any
 man out of the fray.

189
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,067
- I got it.

190
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,733
- Troops assembled to go over
 the plan of attack, sire.

191
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,067
- Good.

192
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,833
I've drawn a map of
 the castle for us.

193
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,067
(roaring)

194
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:53,933
- Who's there?

195
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,967
- Shh, quite.

196
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,733
You'll wake the jailer.

197
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,233
(door creaks)

198
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,067
Are you quite alright?

199
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:17,800
- How do I look?

200
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,167
What do you want?

201
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,467
- I just came to see
 if they hurt you.

202
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
- I am fine.

203
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,300
No thanks to you.

204
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,500
Oh, but you can go now.

205
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,067
You've done your good
 turn for the day.

206
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,500
- Oh, I'm sorry Azabeth.

207
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
But I can do no more.

208
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,867
- Yes you can.

209
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:42,867
- What?

210
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,400
- Help me.

211
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,567
Free me.

212
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,833
- Free you?

213
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,833
Are you mad?

214
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,333
Henry would have
 my head on a pike.

215
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,833
- And he's to have
 mine in the morning.

216
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,667
(sorrowful music)

217
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,267
- I knew not of this.

218
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,100
- You are a slave, you know.

219
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,167
As much as slave as I
 ever was on my own world.

220
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,767
- What is this, your own world?

221
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,067
- Never mind.

222
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,800
- Ha, how am I a slave?

223
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,500
I come as I please.

224
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,933
I go as I please.

225
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,300
I own many beautiful things.

226
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,967
- And you are a beautiful thing,

227
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,067
own yourself.

228
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,933
Jennifer, don't you see?

229
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,200
You belong to Lord Henry,

230
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,933
and all you own
 belongs to Lord Henry.

231
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,867
You mean no more to him
than one of his horses.

232
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:50,067
You are his kept toy
 and nothing more.

233
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:54,067
And the pity of it
 is, you have a choice.

234
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,200
There's a saying
 where I come from.

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,400
The worse prisons are the
 ones we make for ourselves.

236
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,300
- Yes.

237
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:05,767
Another of your Codes of Kong.

238
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,600
- Kang, Codes of Kang.

239
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,733
The 16th to be exact.

240
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,233
- Yes well, I can not free you.

241
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,667
That would be suicide for me.

242
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:26,067
But I can do this much.

243
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,633
I will get a message
 to your friends

244
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,300
in the village this evening.

245
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,833
And tell them that
you're to die tomorrow,

246
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,433
and they must come.

247
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,900
Oh yes, I must do
 this on my own though.

248
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,200
I can not trust anybody here.

249
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,700
- Thank you.

250
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,100
But I must ask one last favor.

251
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,067
- What?

252
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,500
- My weapons, I need them.

253
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,933
Can you bring them to me?

254
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,600
- Well not tonight.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
I will think of something, yes.

256
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,167
I must go now if I'm to
 reach your friends in time.

257
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,833
Good night, Azabeth.

258
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,367
(door creaks)

259
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,533
- Good night.

260
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:10,067
- Henry's dragon guards
 the castle's right flank.

261
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,733
And the castle's
 other battlements
 have guards a plenty.

262
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,267
- How do we get in then?

263
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,833
- A secret way, blacksmith.

264
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,600
A way known only to myself.

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,667
And now to the rest of you.

266
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,233
Travel east along the
 Moors of Blackwater,

267
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,567
till you reach the sheer
 rock face of Killbourn cliff.

268
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,667
There you will find a
 passageway covered by brush.

269
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:32,867
This leads to a secret entrance
inside the castle's stables.

270
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:35,733
Once inside make your way to
 the castle's main entrance,

271
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,367
and throw open the gates.

272
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,833
Gwen, you and the
 rest will wait with me

273
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,067
outside the of castle
 in Shepard's Field.

274
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,233
- We'll be ready.

275
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,533
- We advance on
 Theodore's signal.

276
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,267
- How wide is this
 passage, sire?

277
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,167
Big enough for Theodore, I hope.

278
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,933
(laughter)

279
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,067
- Yes it's big enough
 round for Theodore.

280
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,533
Now listen lads,

281
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,400
once inside the castle I
 will ride against my brother

282
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,567
and his dragon atop
 our own great beast.

283
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,633
I was always the victor in
 the joust against Henry.

284
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,733
And I ought to be able to
 make quick work of him.

285
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,667
That's the plan, lads.

286
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,067
We march at dawn.

287
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,667
To tomorrow.

288
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,500
And victory.

289
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,933
(uplifting music)

290
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,533
- [All] To victory!

291
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,400
(fast paced music)

292
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,667
(laughing and jeering)

293
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,833
- Hello Jennifer.

294
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,900
- Hello Jack.

295
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
- How you've been?

296
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,300
- Well, thank you.

297
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:53,067
- Can't a man get any rest?

298
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,533
Who's this?

299
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:01,867
- I being a message
 from Azabeth Siege.

300
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,967
- I know no Azabeth Siege.

301
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:04,800
- We do.

302
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,133
She's our friend.

303
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:11,633
She's the one your brother
 captured this morning.

304
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:12,733
So what's the message?

305
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:13,567
How is she?

306
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:14,833
Where is she?

307
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,400
- She's being held in
 Lord Henry's dungeon.

308
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,700
- Is she alright?

309
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,900
- For the moment.

310
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,733
Henry has ordered her
 execution at dawn.

311
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:22,567
- Oh.

312
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:27,167
- She asked for her
weapons, and your help.

313
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,067
- And who might you be?

314
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,600
- I am the lady.

315
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:34,233
I am Jennifer.

316
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,867
I am Henry of
 Dearborn's concubine.

317
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,067
- Well, Henry's concubine.

318
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,133
You've taken a great
 risk coming here.

319
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,200
We could hold you
 for ransom you know.

320
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,067
- I'm none too
valuable to the Barron,

321
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,467
as I have only recently
come to realize.

322
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:55,567
I'm afraid I would net
 you precious little.

323
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,400
(sorrowful music)

324
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,300
- Jennifer?

325
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,233
Here.

326
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:06,133
It's Azabeth's silver piece.

327
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,867
Just tell her we'll be there,

328
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,700
and tell her not to worry.

329
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,467
- You must be Josh.

330
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,833
I'll tell her.

331
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,067
- Jennifer, could I inquire?

332
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:20,533
Is the Barron's alchemist
 a tall, dark, brooding man,

333
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,700
with a little, creature that
 follows him wherever he goes?

334
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:29,400
- Yes, the royal alchemist
 Zoetrope is such a man.

335
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,767
Why do you ask?

336
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,333
- Oh no particular reason,

337
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,833
we just have an old score
 to settle, that's all.

338
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,533
Thank you for the information.

339
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,233
- Be on guard, all.

340
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:40,767
Henry plans to march
 on your village

341
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,800
after the execution at dawn.

342
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,633
He and his men will be
 armed and ready for battle

343
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,233
well before sun up.

344
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,067
- Thank you, Jennifer.

345
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:54,067
See that she has safe
 passage back to the castle.

346
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,600
- I wish not for
 your thanks, sire.

347
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,433
For I will do what
 I can on the morrow.

348
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,500
I have much to atone for.

349
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:12,300
Perhaps when all this is over.

350
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,967
- You'll be welcome.

351
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:16,633
- Good luck.

352
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,733
(roaring)

353
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:26,500
(dramatic music)

354
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:01,233
- It looks a bit
narrow in there.

355
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,900
Perhaps I'd best
 go with the others.

356
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,733
- Get going, Theodore.

357
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,133
You're holding up the party.

358
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,967
(dramatic music)

359
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,700
- It is time,

360
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,200
my child.

361
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,233
(sorrowful music)

362
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
(heavy sigh)

363
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,567
(dramatic music)

364
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,900
- Is that meant for us?

365
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,200
- There, the Lady Jennifer.

366
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,700
- Let's not keep the
 lady waiting, gents.

367
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,500
- Well you won't get
 me on that thing.

368
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,233
Alright, you go ahead
and I'll see you inside.

369
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,067
- Alright, be careful.

370
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,700
(dramatic music)

371
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:31,667
(drum in background)

372
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:41,733
(people chatting and
 whispering in background)

373
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,133
- Come on, get up.

374
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,267
Get up.

375
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,600
They want us in the square.

376
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
(chickens clucking)

377
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:46,567
(dramatic music)

378
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,667
- Have you anything to say
 before you meet your maker?

379
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,067
Careful how you
 answer, Azabeth Siege.

380
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,467
It's not too late to
 show me the gratitude you

381
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,233
denied me last night.

382
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,900
(people whispering
 in background)

383
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:28,300
(dramatic music)

384
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:37,233
- You're just a glutton
 for gratitude, aren't you?

385
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,233
- Let the execution begin.

386
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,267
(dramatic music)

387
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,100
- Yes, that's it Josh.

388
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,067
- Thank you, Jennifer.

389
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,833
Oh no, that's Azabeth.

390
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,100
- Suite yourself.

391
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,567
- Lend me your sling shot.

392
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:54,400
- What?

393
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,667
(people whispering
 in background)

394
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:06,167
- Don't move.

395
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,900
(dramatic music)

396
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,933
(screams)

397
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,900
- Oh Azabeth.

398
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,767
(uplifting music)

399
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,800
(dramatic music)

400
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,167
(screams)

401
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:03,267
(dramatic music)

402
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,600
- Attack!

403
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,767
(yelling)

404
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,800
(swords clang)

405
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:24,167
(dramatic music)

406
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,533
- Attack!

407
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,700
- Attack, attack!

408
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,933
- Attack!

409
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:39,500
(clamoring and yelling)

410
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,333
Attack!

411
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:52,167
(swords clang and clash)

412
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
(punches landing)

413
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:11,267
(fighters yelling)

414
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,800
(punches landing)

415
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,967
(swords clang and clash)

416
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,867
(yelling fiercely)

417
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,167
(punches landing)

418
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,733
(horse neighs)

419
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,267
(yelling savagely)

420
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,133
- What took you so long?

421
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:00,700
- Oh you're very welcome.

422
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,467
- Seriously, thank
 you for the rescue.

423
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,433
It seems once again
 I'm in your debt.

424
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,300
- And you can't leave my
side until it's repaid.

425
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,900
The old 12th code
 of Kangaroonie.

426
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,400
- Don't rub it in.

427
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:16,100
(yells viciously)

428
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,433
(dragons roar)

429
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,433
(dramatic music)

430
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,900
(swords clanging in background)

431
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
(roars)

432
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:35,067
(dramatic music)

433
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,167
(dragons roar)

434
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,167
(smacks)

435
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:17,233
- What will you fight
 with now, brother?

436
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,400
- Bare skin if it comes to that.

437
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,233
Brother.

438
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,467
(growls)

439
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,533
(smacks)

440
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,467
(roars in pain)

441
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:42,667
(roars in pain)

442
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:52,867
(sorrowful music)

443
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:53,700
- Damn.

444
00:29:56,133 --> 00:30:00,133
(swords clanging in background)

445
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,600
- What is that?

446
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,600
(yelling out fiercely)

447
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:21,667
- Josh Kirby.

448
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,100
(giggles)

449
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,933
(poof)

450
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:39,700
(chirping)

451
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,633
(poof)

452
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,400
- Fight on brothers.

453
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,967
The day's almost ours.

454
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,767
(swords clanging)

455
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,433
- It was you Lady, wasn't it

456
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:53,367
who dropped the rope
 ladder down to the enemy?

457
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,633
- No you're mistaken.

458
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,100
Stop, I--

459
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,833
(dramatic music)

460
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,467
(soft music)

461
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,300
Jack?

462
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:15,467
(dramatic music)

463
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,633
(yelling and clashing)

464
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:19,467
(laser shot)

465
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,900
(laser shot)

466
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:26,067
(dramatic music)

467
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,767
- Azabeth Siege, you're alive.

468
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,467
I'm so pleased.

469
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,633
- Where have you been?

470
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,900
- Have you seen Dr Zoetrope?

471
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,733
Now, we understand that
 he's the Barron's alchemist.

472
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,533
And he has little Prism
 under some kind of spell.

473
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,933
(poof)

474
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,533
(trills)

475
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,367
Prism.

476
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,900
Well this is getting to
be some kind of reunion.

477
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,567
What's that you have
there, my little friend?

478
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:56,900
(chirping and trilling)

479
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,367
Oh, well done Prism.

480
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,667
Now what about the
 Nullifier component

481
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,333
that was sent into this time?

482
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,333
Is it near?

483
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,500
(squeaks)

484
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,900
(dramatic music)

485
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
(chickens clucking)

486
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:39,233
- Excuse me.

487
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,900
I think those are
 mine, baby brother.

488
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,067
- Then take them back.

489
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,167
Just try.

490
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,733
(dramatic music)

491
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,567
(sword swooshes)

492
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,700
(swords clang)

493
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,333
(dramatic music)

494
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,167
- Congestion brother?

495
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,767
(smacks)

496
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,433
- Now you've made me angry.

497
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,233
(yells savagely)

498
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,733
(dramatic music)

499
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:57,067
- I will make quick work
of you, tub of lard.

500
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,300
(sobs)

501
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,800
(dramatic music)

502
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,067
(grunting)

503
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,667
(smacks)

504
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,700
- Lay down your
 weapon, good knight.

505
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Or else it's good night.

506
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:30,100
(chuckles)

507
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:35,333
- Well that about
 wraps it up then.

508
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,500
- All in a days work.

509
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,633
- Where's William?

510
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,300
- [Both] Don't know.

511
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,067
(dramatic music)

512
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,767
(swords clash)

513
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,200
(dramatic music)

514
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,500
(intense music)

515
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:43,367
(sword swooshes)

516
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:49,067
(smacks)

517
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:02,467
(grunting)

518
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,067
(crowd clamors in fear)

519
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,067
- Sire!

520
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:17,300
(dramatic music)

521
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,700
- That's mine.

522
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,167
- Father's sword
 was the one thing

523
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,067
you could never
 take from me, Henry.

524
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:29,300
- You were always his favorite.

525
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,367
- He tried to love you,

526
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:33,433
but your jealousy
 and your hatred

527
00:36:33,433 --> 00:36:36,167
always blinded you to that.

528
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:39,067
(sorrowful music)

529
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,133
(yells out)

530
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:46,133
(screams then thud)

531
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,433
(sorrowful music)

532
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
(sputtering)

533
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,300
- Hail William!

534
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,300
- [Crowd] Hail William!

535
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:35,433
(cheering)

536
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,700
- Hail William!

537
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:40,367
(cheering)

538
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:44,167
(uplifting music)

539
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:55,567
(dramatic music)

540
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,567
- Hail William!

541
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,400
(laughter)

542
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,667
- Hail William!

543
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:02,800
- Hail William!

544
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:06,633
(dramatic music)

545
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,867
(cheering)

546
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,100
(regal music)

547
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,733
(cheering and applause)

548
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,733
- [Crowd] Hail William!

549
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,233
- Father?

550
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,667
Father, is William going
 to give us a baby dragon?

551
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,833
You said he might.

552
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,400
- We'll see, Jamie.

553
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,267
Dragons eat a lot, you know.

554
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:50,333
- I'll grow a garden
 just to feed it.

555
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:54,300
- As reward for helping
us win this day,

556
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,533
I hereby make my
 first official decree.

557
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:02,067
One of our dragon's off
spring shall go to Jamie

558
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:03,733
and the Blacksmith.

559
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:06,067
(laughter)

560
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:10,100
My friends,

561
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,067
please kneel.

562
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,400
In the absence of his
Royal Majesty the King,

563
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,200
and by the power invested in
 me as Barron of this region,

564
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,867
for your part in helping
us to victory this day,

565
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,633
I knight each of you.

566
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,233
Thank you,

567
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,133
Josh Kirby.

568
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,833
Irwin 1137.

569
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:43,533
- Eight, sire.

570
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:44,367
- 11378.

571
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,100
And Azabeth Siege.

572
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:54,800
We will forever be in your debt.

573
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,800
(cheering and applause)

574
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,633
(uplifting music)

575
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,800
- Where's Prism?

576
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,567
- [Prism] (muttering)

577
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,133
- Oh stop playing games, Prism.

578
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
We still have the
 Nullifier to find.

579
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,033
- No wait, I get it.

580
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,433
- Get what?

581
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,333
I mean Prism is
 hungry, that's all.

582
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,367
I'll bet Zoetrope hasn't fed
 his a single morsel of food

583
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,800
then entire time he's
 kept him prisoner.

584
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,000
- No.

585
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
He's not hungry.

586
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,833
He's trying to tell
 us that the dinosaur

587
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,967
ate the Nullifier component.

588
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,400
- [Prism] (chirping)

589
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,967
- Isn't that it, Prism?

590
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:48,267
- (Squeaks)

591
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,567
- My friends, may I
speak with you privately

592
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:51,667
for a moment?

593
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:57,533
Let's be frank with one another.

594
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,800
I don't know where
 you come from,

595
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,233
and I don't think
 that I wish to know.

596
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:04,700
I fear it might be
 harmful somehow.

597
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,833
But know that I am grateful
 for your intervention.

598
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,433
However it was
arranged by providence.

599
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:14,533
God speed and protect
 you in your travels.

600
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:17,300
In your food
 storage compartment?

601
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:21,067
Farewell Josh Kirby.

602
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:23,300
- My lord.

603
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,067
- Bye Josh.

604
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:29,900
- Bye lad.

605
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,733
- So,

606
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,600
how do we get the component
 back without major surgery?

607
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,200
- Well I want you to
 find me the largest

608
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,400
mixing bowl in the
 entire village.

609
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,733
And prune juice.

610
00:41:46,433 --> 00:41:48,833
Lots and lots of prune juice.

611
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,167
- Ugh, what is that?

612
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:01,167
- Well let's just
 call it dino laxative.

613
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,167
- [Prism] (trilling)

614
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,100
- That's right dinosaur,
drink it all up.

615
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,433
(slurping and chomping)

616
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,167
- Sure gave that triceratops

617
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,300
a bad case of
 indigestion, Irwin.

618
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,500
- She'll be fine.

619
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I don't know where
 Dr Zoetrope could be,

620
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,600
but I strongly suggest
 we vacate this area

621
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,333
as quickly as possible.

622
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,167
- Yeah.

623
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:33,333
(laser fires, people screaming)

624
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:40,433
- [Irwin] Get the
 platform, quickly.

625
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:45,067
(lasers fire)

626
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,300
(dramatic music)

627
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,767
- You're no match
 for me, Josh Kirby.

628
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:51,067
Put that weapon down before
 I'm forced to hurt you.

629
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,700
(laser fires)

630
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,700
(suspenseful music)

631
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:02,200
- Oh no.

632
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,600
(yelling)

633
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:13,933
- [Josh] Holy moly.

634
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,967
- [Irwin] What on earth is that.

635
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:20,300
(screaming)

636
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,667
- [Prism] (cooing)

637
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,700
(suspenseful music)

638
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,400
- Hey.

639
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,767
- Keep off.

640
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,600
Oh give me a break.

641
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,367
You were the one
 who was all over me.

642
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,767
- You really don't expect
 me to believe that, do you?

643
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,667
- (Trilling)

644
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,167
- What's going on?

645
00:43:54,467 --> 00:43:56,867
Picked the wrong time
 to loose my helmet.

646
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,200
That's the second time I've
 been knocked out today.

647
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,500
Hey, get a load of Prism.

648
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,133
There must be a Nullifier
 component near by.

649
00:44:04,133 --> 00:44:06,567
Where's my power staff?

650
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,433
- That giant alien
 must have taken it

651
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:09,633
while we were out cold.

652
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:11,867
- My weapons are gone as well.

653
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:13,400
- What was that thing?

654
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,467
I thought we were
 still on earth.

655
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:18,300
- We are still on earth, Josh.

656
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,967
But the earth of the far future.

657
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:24,967
I can only deduce that by
 the time the year 70,379

658
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:29,133
rolls by, my current's been
defeated by these alien giants.

659
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:33,600
That,

660
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,633
or these mutant
 behemoths are our

661
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:39,400
distant evolutionary
 descendants.

662
00:44:40,633 --> 00:44:43,533
Either way we're in
 rather big trouble.

663
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,967
- (Groaning)

664
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:50,100
- Oh no.

665
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,900
(moaning)

666
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,500
- [Azabeth] They're
 enormous, Josh Kirby.

667
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
They're coming this way.

668
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,967
(yelling)

669
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,100
(suspenseful music)

670
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,200
- He's a kid.

671
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:12,500
The one who found
 us, he's a kid.

672
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,167
And those are his parents.

673
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:15,267
- [Irwin] Oh.

674
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:18,733
(moaning)

675
00:45:18,733 --> 00:45:19,567
- Oh no.

676
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:24,467
The second most intelligent
 man of the 25th century,

677
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:27,567
reduced to the status
 of a human pet.

678
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,100
- Oh no.

679
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,067
They're leaving him all alone.

680
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:34,467
Remain calm.

681
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,967
We have to remain calm.

682
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,267
- [Irwin] What's he doing?

683
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,500
- [Josh] This is not good.

684
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,300
- [Irwin] Put us down
 you (mumbles) child.

685
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,733
- [Josh] Come on.

686
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:45,933
(yelling)

687
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:49,700
Irwin look!

688
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:55,267
- I wish he wouldn't
 squeeze so hard.

689
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:56,933
- Incredible.

690
00:45:56,933 --> 00:46:00,667
The child has a collection
 of time displaced humans.

691
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,933
They must be the flotsam
 and jetsam left in the wake

692
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:05,267
of Zoetrope manic time trek.

693
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,067
Poor souls randomly plucked
 from their own worlds,

694
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,867
and catapulted through
the time stream to this

695
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,167
god forsaken place.

696
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:16,433
- Put how can people
 from other times be here?

697
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:17,833
I thought you said time travel

698
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,067
was impossible
 for living things.

699
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,067
- Man made time travel.

700
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,300
These people have been brought
 here by nature it's self.

701
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,467
A nature which has been
interfered with by Dr Zoetrope.

702
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:32,967
(humming and mumbling)

703
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,733
- Forcing us to fight
 for his amusement.

704
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,667
Just like back home.

705
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,200
- [Giant] (giggling)

706
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,067
- Wait a sec, these guys are
 stuck here just like we are.

707
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:50,700
We have no reason to fight.

708
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,067
(gun shots)

709
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,767
(yelling)

710
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,100
- How about to avoid being
 splattered against something.

711
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,533
- Oh, yeah that's a
 pretty good reason.

712
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:20,533
(moans)

713
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,867
(gun shots in background)

714
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:27,867
- Viva la France!

715
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,067
(dramatic music)

716
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,100
- (Chirps)

717
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,933
- Enguard.

718
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,800
(fast paced music)

719
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:51,233
(weapons clash)

720
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,400
- She's amazing.

721
00:48:04,267 --> 00:48:07,700
(gun shot in background)

722
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,633
- (Chirping)

723
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:15,367
- Oh, take it, Prism.

724
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:19,400
(gun shots)

725
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,233
- (Speaking giant language)

726
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:31,067
- Leave us alone,
 you overgrown infant.

727
00:48:31,067 --> 00:48:33,300
- He wants us to
 fight each other.

728
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,400
- [Azabeth] (yells
 in background)

729
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
- I won't hear of it.

730
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,633
- Well we've got
to do something,

731
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:38,533
otherwise we'll end
 up as wall paper.

732
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,833
Why don't you blast him
with your power staff.

733
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:41,900
(whines)

734
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,400
- [Giant] (chuckles)

735
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,700
- I'm afraid my power staff is
 a rather delicate instrument

736
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,767
which has been damaged
by the jostling of these

737
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:49,600
fleshy headed mutants.

738
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:52,933
- In other words we're up
 a creek without a paddle.

739
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,900
(dramatic music)

740
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,233
(gun shots)

741
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,800
(weapons clangs and clash)

742
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:10,967
I've got an idea.

743
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:12,333
- What?

744
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,733
- Follow my lead.

745
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:22,933
- What in heaven's
 name are you doing?

746
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:25,800
- What they don't have kung
 fu movies int he 25th century?

747
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,700
- Oh I see, we are gonna
 fake an intimate knowledge

748
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,300
of the marshal arts, ha ha!

749
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,233
Oh , sorry.

750
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,133
- (Whining)

751
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,867
(dramatic music)

752
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,900
(gun shots)

753
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,567
- Oh you Shea Ling
pragmatic style is good,

754
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,200
but still I must destroy you.

755
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,633
- Oh no.

756
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,633
No, my quantum particle
acceleration style

757
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:13,967
is more than a match
 for the likes of you.

758
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:17,133
(dramatic music)

759
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:19,800
(weapons clang)

760
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:26,133
(guns click empty)

761
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:45,333
- You two can stop your
ridiculous gyrations, I've won.

762
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,400
(dramatic music)

763
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,633
- (Giggles and cheers)

764
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,500
- I owe you my life.

765
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,500
In solemn accordance with
 the 12th code of Kang,

766
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,133
I pledge not to leave your
side until this debt is repaid.

767
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:06,867
- You don't have too.

768
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:10,067
Oh, yeah, the 12th code.

769
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:14,600
My dad always told me you
 got to play by the rules.

770
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,833
(giggling)

771
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:29,800
- This is a fine weapon.

772
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,133
Much like the shriek
of the draconian guard.

773
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,133
You must teach me
 to use it someday.

774
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,067
- Sure.

775
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:42,967
It's a date.

776
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,167
(yelling)

777
00:51:47,567 --> 00:51:50,067
- [Josh] Oh no,
 put us back down.

778
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:52,500
- [Azabeth] Put us
 down you (mumbles).

779
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,267
(dramatic music)

780
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,467
- Stay back Josh Kirby,

781
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:07,067
I'll finish off this pathetic
 excuse for a warrior.

782
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:07,833
- No.

783
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:11,700
There's no reason for
 us to fight anymore.

784
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,767
Are you okay?

785
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,367
Look, I'm sorry about the
 bump on the head D'Artagnan.

786
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,433
Here.

787
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,100
- (Speaks French)

788
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,600
- Oh, y'all speak English?

789
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,433
Woo wee!

790
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:29,633
Gave up hoping I'd meet
 anyone in this crazy town

791
00:52:29,633 --> 00:52:32,067
which savvy my lingo.

792
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:35,533
Names Willie Pooch, out
of Dry Gulch, Kansas.

793
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:38,567
What's your handle half pint?

794
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:40,500
- Josh, Josh Kirby.

795
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,067
- Well howdy.

796
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:44,067
- These are my
 friends, Irwin 1138.

797
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:45,067
- Howdy.

798
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:46,633
- Howdy, howdy.

799
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:48,067
- Azabeth Siege.

800
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:49,067
- Oh, mama.

801
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:54,867
- And this down here is Prism.

802
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,867
- Oh cute little coyote.

803
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,967
Puts me in mind of that
 time I was pond for turmoil

804
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:03,133
out by Sassafras Creek.

805
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:06,767
Creature just like
 him sprung upon me

806
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:11,567
from out of the dim night
 and my heart nearly stopped.

807
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,267
Before I realized it
was just Midget McCarthy

808
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:15,533
back from panning for gold.

809
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,500
He'd been up in
 the hills so long

810
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,333
his whiskers had grown
clean down to his toes.

811
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,433
- I thought he said
 he spoke English?

812
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:28,567
- If you gentlemen
 are quite finished

813
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:31,467
telling these tall tales,

814
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,367
I suggest we move on to
the more pressing matter

815
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,300
of planning our escape.

816
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,067
- Woo wee, you
 speak English too.

817
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:40,467
How come you never said nothing?

818
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,467
- Well in your case
 I prefer to let my

819
00:53:42,467 --> 00:53:44,300
pistol do the talking.

820
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,167
- Not a very friendly
 fellow, are you?

821
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:50,067
- Friendship is not the issue.

822
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:52,267
We all share the
 same predicament.

823
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:54,067
We were all struck
 by lightening,

824
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,500
and somehow transported
into the clutches

825
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,067
of this over fed, kent,

826
00:53:59,067 --> 00:54:00,667
Unt we must escape.

827
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:04,733
- You sure talk
 mighty funny, bud.

828
00:54:04,733 --> 00:54:05,800
Where you from anyhow?

829
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,833
- Heidelberg.

830
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,100
- Oh, Heidelberg?

831
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,067
Is that south of the border?

832
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,667
- Nein, dummkoff.

833
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:14,667
(all speaking at once)

834
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:16,667
- Alright now listen up.

835
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:19,833
I don't care what
 language you speak,

836
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,567
but we all have to shut
up and work together

837
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,400
so we can get out of this mess.

838
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,567
- Perhaps I can be
 of some assistance.

839
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,400
(speaking French)

840
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,300
(uplifting music)

841
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,467
(all talking at once)

842
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:53,133
- What was that all about?

843
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:54,333
Are they just mad
 because she's a girl

844
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,433
and she can fight
 better than they can.

845
00:54:56,433 --> 00:54:57,900
- Beats me.

846
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,200
I gave up trying to understand
 human behavior years ago.

847
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,800
That's why I'm a physicists.

848
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,300
(staff whirs)

849
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:11,200
(soft music)

850
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,700
- What's wrong, Azabeth?

851
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,533
- Nothing.

852
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,667
Nothing is wrong, this
 is how it always is.

853
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,267
- What do you mean?

854
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,067
- Where I come from
 all of my people

855
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:35,567
are traded as property.

856
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:37,967
We are forced to fight
 each other in arenas of war

857
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,467
just because we are different.

858
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:44,100
- Different, I don't get it.

859
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:47,800
- Don't try and tell
me you haven't noticed.

860
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,067
- Noticed what?

861
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:52,733
- This.

862
00:55:52,733 --> 00:55:53,567
And this.

863
00:55:55,267 --> 00:55:58,133
I'm not like you and
those others Josh Kirby.

864
00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:00,333
I'm only half human.

865
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:03,067
Pure humans think me and
my people are freaks.

866
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:04,300
Twisted, weird.

867
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:10,067
- Look, some people
 think I'm weird too.

868
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,367
- Really?

869
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:13,200
- Sure.

870
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,267
But that's their problem.

871
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:20,667
I admit I used to
worry about this a lot.

872
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,933
Especially Mrs Manabalm's
 social studies class.

873
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:27,233
You see there was
 this girl, Beth.

874
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,400
Every time I tried to
 make eye contact with her,

875
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,367
she'd turn and look at me like
 I was some sort of disease.

876
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:34,933
She was friendly to everybody.

877
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,200
Except yours truly.

878
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,067
Man she was beautiful.

879
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:43,167
(school bell rings)

880
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:46,800
And believe me, girls
weren't my only problem.

881
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,267
A couple of guys on
the junior varsity team

882
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,767
thought they owned the place.

883
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:51,933
- Don't you know who I am?

884
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:53,233
- Duke.

885
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,500
- Duke Dunkington.

886
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,567
Quarterback of
 the football team.

887
00:56:56,567 --> 00:56:58,200
- Captain of the wrestling team.

888
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,900
Anchor of the track team, and
 God's gift to Green Oaks High.

889
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,733
- If I tell you, do
 my homework geek,

890
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:06,567
- Maggot.

891
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:07,533
- Worm.

892
00:57:07,533 --> 00:57:09,300
- You do my homework.

893
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,333
- [Josh] I think high
 school isn't so much a place

894
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,533
for learning, as it is for
 maybe an organized attempt

895
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:18,833
to make each and every
 student feel like a worm.

896
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,067
(school bell rings)

897
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,100
It gets to me some days.

898
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,767
It gets to me a lot.

899
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,200
(whimsical music)

900
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,200
But the truth is,
 it doesn't matter.

901
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:34,900
The only thing that matters
 is what I think of myself.

902
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,600
If I'm happy with me,

903
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,767
I don't have to go out and
 buy some special sneakers,

904
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:42,267
or listen to the
 most popular music,

905
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,900
or live in some big fancy house

906
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,833
just to make people
 think I'm cool.

907
00:57:52,533 --> 00:57:56,700
- For one so young you posses
 a great wisdom, Josh Kirby.

908
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,567
Here.

909
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:02,800
Here take this.

910
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,300
To protect yourself in case
 something happens to me.

911
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,133
- Thanks.

912
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:14,500
(clears throat)

913
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,300
- Excuse me, Josh.

914
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,767
These gentlemen would like to
 apologies to Azabeth Siege.

915
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:24,133
Monsieur Don Joure thought
 you were a hellish sorceress

916
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,900
conjured up by his arch enemy.

917
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,333
Cardinal Arigleou.

918
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,867
- Oh yeah, sweet cakes,

919
00:58:28,867 --> 00:58:32,067
I thought you were was some
 kind of Siamese witch woman

920
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,200
out to put the hoo ju on me.

921
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,433
It was all just a
 misunderstanding.

922
00:58:37,433 --> 00:58:39,133
Give us a second
chance, what do you say?

923
00:58:39,133 --> 00:58:43,267
- Could we please put
an end to this love fest

924
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:46,500
und get back to
 the matter at hand.

925
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,200
Macht schnell!

926
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,300
- Yelling won't help matters.

927
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,700
But perhaps this will.

928
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,533
Excuse me.

929
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,733
(dramatic music)

930
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:57,900
- A cane?

931
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,833
And what do you
suggest we do, old man?

932
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,267
Limp our way out?

933
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,533
- My power staff may require
 a little re-calibrating

934
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:07,267
from time to time.

935
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:08,967
Once that's done.

936
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:13,300
- These magic tricks may
impress these creatures,

937
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,267
but I am a man of the world.

938
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:17,900
- Oh.

939
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,633
(staff beeping)

940
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:22,900
(glass shatters)

941
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,167
Any more comments,
 man of the world?

942
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:26,067
- Nien.

943
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:30,367
- You're all welcome to
join us, if you wish.

944
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:33,200
(speaking French)

945
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,667
(dramatic music)

946
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,967
- Well wait for me.

947
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:46,700
(glass clinking)

948
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:50,067
Where to, partners?

949
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:51,100
- Don't worry.

950
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,700
He's got it all figured out.

951
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,300
He's the second most brilliant
 man of the 25th century.

952
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,967
- Josh, I have a
 confession to make.

953
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:01,133
I acted rather prematurely
 in order to shut up

954
01:00:01,133 --> 01:00:03,167
that loud mouth German.

955
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:07,367
In fact, I've no idea
 what our next move is.

956
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:08,967
- We've got to
 find the time pod.

957
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:10,433
- But how?

958
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:13,100
We could be thousands of mils
 away from where we landed.

959
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,500
Could take us years to find
 that giant kids foot print.

960
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,700
- Now listen to me Irwin 1138,

961
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,700
I was a kid once myself.

962
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,800
I know how they think.

963
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,333
No kid, not even a
 giant mutant kid,

964
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,967
could take a collection
of action figures home

965
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:29,833
and leave their super cool
 scale model vehicle behind.

966
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,267
- Look, up there.

967
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,367
It's my beloved Brunhilde.

968
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:36,100
- Yes!

969
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:37,933
- Where?

970
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:39,633
Where is this Brunhilde?

971
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,333
I don't see no girlie up there.

972
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:44,833
Brunhilde is mine
 plane, you idiot.

973
01:00:44,833 --> 01:00:49,600
- But plane or fancy I
 still don't see no girlie.

974
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,267
- But how are we going to
 get up to the time pod?

975
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:55,000
It's a sheer cliff,
 50 feet high.

976
01:00:58,467 --> 01:01:00,500
- I have an idea.

977
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,300
Follow me.

978
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,767
We'll use this to make a rope.

979
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,067
- Monsieur Don Joure.

980
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:15,067
- Oh it's disgusting.

981
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:16,867
It's a kids underwear.

982
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:21,233
Alright, lets help
 her out D'Artagnan.

983
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:22,667
- You know.

984
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,400
Oh, sorry Pierre.

985
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,733
I was champion cow
 roper of Wabash County

986
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,267
three years running.

987
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,500
I'll knot those suckers up.

988
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,900
- Oh you sure
 about this Azabeth?

989
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:42,867
- I scaled a 1000 foot wall
 in Gouldren Fortress of Quan

990
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,900
when I was seven.

991
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,400
I think I know what I'm doing.

992
01:01:49,133 --> 01:01:50,133
- I'm sorry.

993
01:01:54,533 --> 01:01:57,067
(fabric ripping)

994
01:01:57,067 --> 01:02:00,667
- My Brunhilde is the
 finest fighter plane

995
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:03,667
on the entire western front.

996
01:02:03,667 --> 01:02:06,367
(fabric tearing)

997
01:02:06,367 --> 01:02:08,467
- You must be very proud.

998
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:12,400
(snoring)

999
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,867
(dramatic music)

1000
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,267
(ripping)

1001
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,267
(loud snoring)

1002
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,067
- There you go, darlin'.

1003
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,533
- Now are you certain that these
knots will hold our weight?

1004
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:03,700
- Sweet cakes this baby
is strong enough to hog

1005
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,700
tie a herd of wild
 buffalo, ugh-huh.

1006
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,767
- (Chirps)

1007
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:12,933
(yelling)

1008
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,667
- Well done, Prism.

1009
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,700
- Thanks Prism.

1010
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:27,700
- Woo wee!

1011
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,067
(intense music)

1012
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:09,333
(rope thuds to floor)

1013
01:04:15,233 --> 01:04:17,467
- Last one up is a

1014
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:21,667
desert cockroach from the
barren planets of Rinmar seven.

1015
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,667
- You got a head
 start, sweet cakes.

1016
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:28,433
(intense music)

1017
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,467
- Be careful Josh Kirby,
and remember number 14

1018
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:45,167
of the 21 codes of Kang.

1019
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,833
- Yeah, what's that.

1020
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:49,267
- [Azabeth] Never look down.

1021
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,967
- Alright, come on.

1022
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:57,833
- This is dirty infantry work.

1023
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:01,133
I should be flying above it all.

1024
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:05,133
But I will do anything to get
 back to my beloved Brunhilde.

1025
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:06,633
- You certainly have an
interesting relationship

1026
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:07,967
with your plane.

1027
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,667
- Woo wee, I ain't
 see this much rope

1028
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:21,833
since Judge Parker strung up
all 12 of the Algebers at once.

1029
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:26,400
(speaking French)

1030
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,133
- Oh you said it, Lucky Pierre.

1031
01:05:30,133 --> 01:05:33,867
Don't know what you
 said, but you did say it.

1032
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:38,700
(pane groaning)

1033
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:41,067
- Did you feel that?

1034
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:42,133
- What?

1035
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:43,533
- The rope.

1036
01:05:43,533 --> 01:05:44,467
It slipped.

1037
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:49,867
(grunting and straining)

1038
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:55,300
Quick, Josh Kirby
 stop the plane.

1039
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,633
(clamoring)

1040
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,867
it's slipping.

1041
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:11,433
Hold on Josh Kirby.

1042
01:06:17,633 --> 01:06:19,633
- [Cowboy] Hurry up now.

1043
01:06:20,867 --> 01:06:23,633
(dramatic music)

1044
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,300
(yelling)

1045
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:02,633
- Well done.

1046
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,567
(breathing heavy)

1047
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:10,333
- My compliments.

1048
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:14,500
You all deserve the Iron
 Cross for saving Brunhilde.

1049
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,433
(speaking German)

1050
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:34,167
- Oh that Heidelberg dude is
 not playing with a full deck.

1051
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,067
- Oh cool.

1052
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,533
- What's that?

1053
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:41,700
- This is a mountain bike.

1054
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,367
It's excellent.

1055
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:48,733
I had a bike at home,
 but nothing like this.

1056
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:53,433
All my dad could afford
 was a rusty old one speed.

1057
01:07:53,433 --> 01:07:56,867
Oh man, I hope he's
 not worried about me.

1058
01:07:58,067 --> 01:08:00,300
You know I can just
imagine him coming home

1059
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,867
the night I took off
 on this crazy mission.

1060
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:07,233
It probably seemed like
any other night, really.

1061
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:08,500
He would have been bushed

1062
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,333
from another hard
 day at the plant.

1063
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:13,200
- Josh.

1064
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:17,367
- [Josh] My dad is always
 worried about my future.

1065
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:19,800
How was I gonna do on the SATs?

1066
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,267
Are college costs going up
 faster than his credit line?

1067
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,767
Or was I gonna totally flake out

1068
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,067
and decide not to go
 to college at all?

1069
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,833
- Josh, I'm home.

1070
01:08:36,067 --> 01:08:39,067
(suspenseful music)

1071
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,700
For crying out loud Josh,

1072
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,067
do you know what time it is?

1073
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,867
- He never used to let
 me do anything dangerous.

1074
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:02,800
Anything physical
 at all, really.

1075
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,067
He was afraid I
 would hurt myself

1076
01:09:04,067 --> 01:09:07,200
and ruin my chances to
go to Harvard and Yale.

1077
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,733
If I pass this AP test,

1078
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:11,500
well they're having tryouts
 after school next week

1079
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,833
for the football team.

1080
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,067
Yeah, I'm pretty
 fast and I know--

1081
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,300
- Team sports cut too
deep into homework time

1082
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,800
- But dad.

1083
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,533
- Besides, you don't want
 to hang out with those guys.

1084
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,067
They're all dumb jocks.

1085
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,133
One out of a 1000 will
 land a $1 million contract

1086
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:26,400
the rest will end up with
 me down at the plant.

1087
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,067
Or worse, getting grease
stains from french fries

1088
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:30,967
down at burger world.

1089
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:34,100
You just stick to the books.

1090
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,633
You'll earn a big scholarship

1091
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,167
and then we won't have
 to worry about how

1092
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:40,067
were gonna have to pay your
 tuition to Harvard and Yale.

1093
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:42,867
- Dad I cant' go to
 Harvard and Yale.

1094
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:46,300
- First time for
everything, son.

1095
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,933
- Every morning on
 my way to school

1096
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,667
I would ride my
 bike like a maniac.

1097
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:53,833
(fast paced music)

1098
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:57,400
For a kid riding a
 bike is like flying.

1099
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,633
Sometimes I pretend
 I'm flying an F16.

1100
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:02,400
Or driving an Indy car.

1101
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,867
Or doing a motor cross.

1102
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:06,600
Spokes spinning, the
 wind in your hair,

1103
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,067
the leaves in your face.

1104
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:12,100
There are few things more
 fun than riding a bike.

1105
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:12,933
Sorry.

1106
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:18,067
(fast paced music)

1107
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:24,133
It was my one real
 chance for adventure.

1108
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:28,100
After all my dad couldn't
 keep me from going to school.

1109
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,800
- Will you show me how it works?

1110
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,867
- Yeah, sure.

1111
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:37,100
(speaking German)

1112
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,933
- Y'alls don't get out
much, do ya Heidelberg?

1113
01:10:47,767 --> 01:10:50,600
(speaking German)

1114
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,800
(suspenseful music)

1115
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,767
- What's the trouble?

1116
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:00,900
- The storm which
 brought me here

1117
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,267
seems to have injured Brunhilde.

1118
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:04,933
- You mean the
 engine isn't working?

1119
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:07,267
- I mean the engine is dead.

1120
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,433
- Hey, is that a parachute?

1121
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,533
Oh how do you work this thing?

1122
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:19,400
- Why do you ask such
 stupid questions?

1123
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,800
You count to three,
 and you pull the cord.

1124
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,733
(speaking German)

1125
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:28,067
- Hey, this is what they
 use to go sky diving with.

1126
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:29,200
- What's sky diving?

1127
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,567
Is it anything
 like riding a bike?

1128
01:11:30,567 --> 01:11:34,067
- Don't you idiots
 understand what this means?

1129
01:11:34,067 --> 01:11:37,133
Without mine plane
 I am stuck up here.

1130
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:39,067
- Join the club, Heidi.

1131
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:43,067
- Hey maybe you'll just have
 to leave your plane here

1132
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:44,767
and come with the rest of us.

1133
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,933
- Josh, it's not
 as simple as that.

1134
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:50,700
My time pod wasn't designed
 to transport this many people

1135
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,567
through the fourth dimension.

1136
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:55,967
And even if it was, where
 would we transport them too?

1137
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:57,700
Their native temporal zones

1138
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,733
must be just as
 screwed up as yours.

1139
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,300
- We can't just leave 'em here.

1140
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,467
(giant groans)

1141
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:09,200
(dramatic music)

1142
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,400
- He seems upset.

1143
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,400
- I set my buetocks he's
angrier than a pole cat

1144
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,933
in a hornets nest.

1145
01:12:28,933 --> 01:12:32,733
And we are as doomed as a
 tender foot in Tomb Stone.

1146
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:34,267
- We can not give up now.

1147
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:36,200
The battle is not lost if the
 warrior still has the courage

1148
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,600
to fight on, that's
 clearly stated

1149
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,833
in the third code of Kang.

1150
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,733
- Viva la Kang.

1151
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:42,100
- Yeah, you said it Azabeth.

1152
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,300
And it sure ain't over yet.

1153
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,300
- Josh what are you doing?

1154
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,333
- I'm gonna get his attention.

1155
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,067
Divert him away from you guys.

1156
01:12:47,067 --> 01:12:48,600
- What are we
 supposed to do then?

1157
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,900
- You'll think of something.

1158
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:54,200
(giant muttering)

1159
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,933
(dramatic music)

1160
01:13:05,733 --> 01:13:07,167
- What are you doing old man?

1161
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,800
- Josh put himself
 into danger in order

1162
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,200
to buy us some more time.

1163
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,433
We must make full use of it.

1164
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:13,167
Now if I can locate the
appropriate circuitry,

1165
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:16,067
I can perform what you 20th
 century primitives call

1166
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:17,133
a jump start.

1167
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,333
- Come on.

1168
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:24,933
- Be careful Josh Kirby!

1169
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:27,800
- Yee ha!

1170
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,467
- Come on, you big bully.

1171
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:33,133
Catch me if you can.

1172
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:38,133
(mumbling and groaning)

1173
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:40,833
(dramatic music)

1174
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,300
- Over here shorty.

1175
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,367
(crying)

1176
01:13:52,467 --> 01:13:55,367
- (Speaking giant)

1177
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,600
(crying)

1178
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,167
- Oh thank god.

1179
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,500
- [Zoetrope] Joshua.

1180
01:14:18,633 --> 01:14:20,933
Over here, help me Joshua.

1181
01:14:20,933 --> 01:14:22,300
(dramatic music)

1182
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,467
- Dr Zoetrope?

1183
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:28,267
- [Zoetrope] Josh
 you must free me

1184
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:29,800
so that I can save the universe.

1185
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,300
- What do you think I am?

1186
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,133
An idiot?

1187
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:36,067
You want to destroy
 the universe.

1188
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:37,500
Everything that ever did exist,

1189
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,333
does exist or will exist.

1190
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:44,100
I saw what you did to my
time just by showing up.

1191
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,533
And you've already found a
 second Nullifier component.

1192
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,200
- Listen to me boy.

1193
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,367
There are forces at work here
 which you cannot understand.

1194
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,467
Help me out of my
unfortunate predicament,

1195
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:56,933
and I will give you power
 you have never dreamed of.

1196
01:14:56,933 --> 01:14:59,367
- What good is power if you
 don't have your friends?

1197
01:14:59,367 --> 01:15:02,567
Or your family, or your home?

1198
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:04,433
No, I'll never help you.

1199
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:08,967
- Then you've sealed your
 own doom, Josh Kirby.

1200
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,633
(squishing)

1201
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:11,467
- Oh yuck.

1202
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,200
I'll help you out of this mess,

1203
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,067
but only so Irwin
 1138 can take you back

1204
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,667
to the 25th century nut
house, where you belong.

1205
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:20,900
- Only a little fool could be

1206
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:24,167
taken in by that
jealous old man.

1207
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:26,767
- Sticks and stones
 may break my bones,

1208
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:28,333
but words can never hurt me.

1209
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:32,167
- How about giant mutant
spiders of 70,000 AD?

1210
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,533
- Don't try that trick on me.

1211
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:37,233
Maybe I'll quite this
 nice guy routine,

1212
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,633
and leave you stuck
 in this web until

1213
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:42,767
your friend spider
 really does come back.

1214
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,900
(dramatic music)

1215
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,167
(growling)

1216
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,100
(laser blast)

1217
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,567
- We must hurry.

1218
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:07,433
The kid could return
 at any moment.

1219
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:10,667
- Hey Irwin, you think
 he'll be okay up here?

1220
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,967
- Yes his time armor will
 protect him from the rigors

1221
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:14,967
of chronoal displacement.

1222
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:17,400
Besides he's too big to
go into the time pod.

1223
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,633
And I can't figure out

1224
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:20,467
how to get him out of
 that blasted thing.

1225
01:16:20,467 --> 01:16:23,333
- [Zoetrope] I'm still
smarter than you Irwin.

1226
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,133
Nothing you can do
 can change that.

1227
01:16:25,133 --> 01:16:25,967
- Oh.

1228
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:32,233
(beeping)

1229
01:16:34,067 --> 01:16:35,433
- Well have you
 made up your minds?

1230
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:36,700
- Yeah.

1231
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,467
We took a vote and
 it was unanimous.

1232
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:44,667
Even my Nordic ancestor Guntag
 Muntag over here agreed.

1233
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:46,933
After he regained his senses.

1234
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:47,767
- Yeah.

1235
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:49,867
- That was my idea.

1236
01:16:49,867 --> 01:16:52,200
Democracy in action.

1237
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,867
- Stupidity in action would
 be closer to the truth.

1238
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:59,400
None the less your jump
 start seems to have given

1239
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,433
Brunhilde an endless
 power supply.

1240
01:17:02,433 --> 01:17:04,367
So it shouldn't be
 that dangerous for us.

1241
01:17:04,367 --> 01:17:07,900
After all we could live for
 a year off the table scraps

1242
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,933
from one of these creatures
 between meal snacks.

1243
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:12,333
We will explore far and wide.

1244
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:17,433
Seeking for others,
 others such as ourselves.

1245
01:17:17,433 --> 01:17:20,200
Perhaps I will even
 find Heidelberg again.

1246
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
There is, however, one problem.

1247
01:17:24,467 --> 01:17:28,200
Brunhilde simply cannot
 carry more than four persons.

1248
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,900
And that's stripped bare
and with this cow poker

1249
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,400
strapped to the wing.

1250
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,667
- Now that sounds
 right fun, Heidi.

1251
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:39,067
What part is the wing?

1252
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:42,167
- Josh if your own
 theory is correct.

1253
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:47,567
Once we've traced Dr
 Zoetrope steps back through

1254
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:49,767
time to the 25th century,

1255
01:17:49,767 --> 01:17:53,400
Azabeth Siege will be
 blinked back to her own time

1256
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,600
where ever that is, and
 you'll never see her again.

1257
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:00,633
- Well at least
 we'll get a chance

1258
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:02,400
to hang out with each other.

1259
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,067
- Well put.

1260
01:18:04,067 --> 01:18:05,300
- Yeah, thanks.

1261
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:08,133
- Listen Azabeth,

1262
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:10,833
if you want to come
 with Irwin and me,

1263
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,300
it's no trouble, really.

1264
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,400
I mean I think it would
be great if you came.

1265
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,333
But it's all up to you.

1266
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,567
- Of course I'm coming with you.

1267
01:18:21,567 --> 01:18:23,867
Josh Kirby how many
 times must I tell you,

1268
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:26,100
in solemn accordance with
 the 12th code of Kang,

1269
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,833
I must remain by your side
 until I have saved your life.

1270
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:31,233
In return for you saving mine.

1271
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:34,400
- What if you never get
 the chance to save my life?

1272
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,900
- Then we must spend the
 rest of our days together.

1273
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:38,733
- Well.

1274
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:42,400
Yeah, I can live with that.

1275
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:45,467
All aboard, all aboard.

1276
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,800
- Schnell.

1277
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,467
- Azabeth is coming with us.

1278
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:49,933
- Au Revoir, mes amis.

1279
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,933
- Au Revoir.

1280
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,067
- Nice knowing you, buckaroos.

1281
01:18:55,067 --> 01:18:57,567
Hope we cross paths
 again sometime.

1282
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:58,400
- Yeah.

1283
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:02,567
- Well come along you two.

1284
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:05,633
Time is one thing we
 can't afford to waste.

1285
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:08,367
(dramatic music)

1286
01:19:14,067 --> 01:19:15,600
- You think they'll make it?

1287
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,100
- Well as long as they
 don't strangle each other

1288
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,400
they should be okay.

1289
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,433
(plane propeller humming)

1290
01:19:21,433 --> 01:19:22,267
- Woo!

1291
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,800
(plane whooshes by)

1292
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:35,100
(crying)

1293
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,767
(beeps and bops)

1294
01:19:37,767 --> 01:19:39,767
- Prepare for the storm.

1295
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:45,067
(time pod humming)

1296
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,767
(dramatic music)

1297
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:51,600
(yells and cries)

1298
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,467
(engines blast)

1299
01:20:16,667 --> 01:20:18,633
- Here you are young lady.

1300
01:20:18,633 --> 01:20:21,633
Now it's perfectly safe
 for you to go out in time

1301
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:24,267
periods other than your own.

1302
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:26,367
Like our next stop, 1994.

1303
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,967
That's where I'm from, you know.

1304
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:31,233
- That'll be interesting to see.

1305
01:20:31,233 --> 01:20:34,733
- Well, it's not exactly
how it's supposed to be.

1306
01:20:34,733 --> 01:20:36,600
But we're gonna fix all that.

1307
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,267
Right, Irwin 1138?

1308
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:39,800
- Right.

1309
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,867
Prism, don't touch that button.

1310
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:43,633
(dramatic music)

1311
01:20:50,133 --> 01:20:51,067
Grab him, Josh.

1312
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:51,900
- Prism stop!

1313
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,133
(whoosh)

1314
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:55,767
(beeps)

1315
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:57,700
- I don't believe it.

1316
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,300
Prism's gone wrong.

1317
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:05,400
- It just goes to prove number
 18 of the 21 codes of Kang.

1318
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,300
Anything too cute
 can't be trusted.

1319
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:12,433
(dramatic music)

1320
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,400
- Help, help.

1321
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,167
(alarm blaring)

1322
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,267
- Josh Kirby.

1323
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,467
Hold on, Josh Kirby.

1324
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:27,800
- Azabeth!

1325
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,467
Come on, reach.

1326
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,167
(alarm blares)

1327
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:40,867
- Josh.

1328
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:43,633
- Josh Kirby.

1329
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,433
- You can do it.

1330
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:53,167
(yelling)

1331
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:05,367
Reach.

1332
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,167
- Hold on.

1333
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:22,633
- [Josh] Come on, come on.

1334
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,233
- [Irwin] Well done, Azabeth.

1335
01:22:30,433 --> 01:22:32,400
- Josh Kirby, are you alright?

1336
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,500
Are you hurt?

1337
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:38,733
(chirps)

1338
01:22:38,733 --> 01:22:40,800
- I don't know.

1339
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,067
I could have grabbed for him,

1340
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:43,333
but my side kind of hurts.

1341
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,167
- Where?

1342
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,433
- No, no lower.

1343
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,167
No lower.

1344
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:49,267
Lower.

1345
01:22:49,267 --> 01:22:50,933
Right there.

1346
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:51,767
Yeah.

1347
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,833
Owe.

1348
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,333
- That's what you get
 for faking an injury.

1349
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:01,733
- Okay, okay geeze.

1350
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:04,667
- Look, will you two
 stop fooling around.

1351
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:06,233
Zoetrope is gone.

1352
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:09,233
And so are the
 Nullifier components.

1353
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:12,800
- I saved your life
 just now Josh Kirby.

1354
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,467
My debt to you have been repaid.

1355
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:18,700
- Yeah.

1356
01:23:20,067 --> 01:23:21,533
You know I don't get it.

1357
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:23,667
I thought Prism was on our side.

1358
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,767
- Yeah was on our side.

1359
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:29,067
But somehow Zoetrope
 must have turned him.

1360
01:23:29,067 --> 01:23:30,433
This is terrible.

1361
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,833
What's worse there's
no way of telling which

1362
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,233
time period they've fled too.

1363
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:38,933
- Excuse me.

1364
01:23:38,933 --> 01:23:39,767
- What?

1365
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,767
- I think I know
 where we need to go.

1366
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:47,200
(computer beeps)

1367
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,100
Yeah, yeah I did this right.

1368
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,933
Didn't I?

1369
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,867
- Brace yourselves.

1370
01:23:56,133 --> 01:23:58,467
Prepare for the storm.

1371
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,800
(explosion)

1372
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:04,500
(yells)

1373
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,933
- [Announcer] On
 the next chapter of

1374
01:24:05,933 --> 01:24:08,067
Josh Kirby, Time Warrior.

1375
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,467
(yelling)

1376
01:24:17,367 --> 01:24:20,267
- Look my name's Josh,
and I'm afraid I'm lost.

1377
01:24:20,267 --> 01:24:21,933
- Don't be afraid, Josh.

1378
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,067
(growls)

1379
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:27,900
- [Josh] This place
 is really weird.

1380
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,433
- [Doll] No it's not, you silly.

1381
01:24:29,433 --> 01:24:30,700
It's toy world.

1382
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:34,367
(cheering)

1383
01:24:34,367 --> 01:24:36,967
- I have tried every trick
 in the time travel book

1384
01:24:36,967 --> 01:24:38,233
to locate Josh.

1385
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:43,067
- I've got to get
 back to the time pod.

1386
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:46,200
- There is an off chance
that Zoetrope's slightly

1387
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,433
superior intellect may
 enhance his ability

1388
01:24:49,433 --> 01:24:51,900
to pinpoint Josh's location.

1389
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,233
- [Zoetrope] I'm
 here for one reason,

1390
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:55,733
and one reason only.

1391
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:57,367
- What is it?

1392
01:24:57,367 --> 01:24:58,800
- It's a piece of the Nullifier.

1393
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,567
- [Zoetrope] The
component, Josh.

1394
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:01,667
Now.

1395
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:03,067
- Alright.

1396
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:05,133
New game everyone.

1397
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:09,367
Keep this glass bulb away
 from the big scary guy,

1398
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:11,400
what do you say?

1399
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,700
(laughing and clamoring)

1400
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,133
(laughter)

1401
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:17,700
- This is getting really good.

1402
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,200
- [Zoetrope] Come
 back here, Joshua.

1403
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,333
- Josh and I are going
 into Nightmare Forest.

1404
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,067
- Nightmare Forest?

1405
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,667
- Nightmare Forest?

1406
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,067
Isn't there some way
we could talk this out?

1407
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:33,367
- [Zoetrope] It's true,
he is a time warrior.

1408
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:34,200
- Whoa.

1409
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,200
I'm some kind of warrior.

1410
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,467
Call me Time Lord.

1411
01:25:41,467 --> 01:25:42,700
- Wait a minute.

1412
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,467
- [Josh] Unless you
 toys are with me.

1413
01:25:44,467 --> 01:25:45,933
The universe is
 doomed for destruction

1414
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:49,067
at the hands of this mad man.

1415
01:25:49,067 --> 01:25:51,833
(dramatic music)

1416
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,733
There's some way out of here.

1417
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:56,167
- Well I say we
 take care of that

1418
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:57,733
big bully once and for all.

1419
01:25:57,733 --> 01:25:58,600
(boing)

1420
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,467
(smack)

1421
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:00,633
(yelling)

1422
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:02,467
(squelch)

1423
01:26:02,467 --> 01:26:04,700
(squish)

1424
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,467
(laughter)

1425
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:10,233
(dramatic music)

1426
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:24,667
(whimsical music)

1427
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:12,867
(MultiCom Jingle)
