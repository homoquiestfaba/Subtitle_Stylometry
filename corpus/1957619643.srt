00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,234
[Lenny] When I was
nine years old

2
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,694
my mother gave me some money
to put in the charity box,

3
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:28,779
at Hebrew School.

4
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,781
On the way

5
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,866
I passed the bakery with crisp
cookies in the window.

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,077
I'm dying to buy one but,

7
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,453
my mother would kill me.

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,872
So, I go to school

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,374
and put all the charity
money in the box.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,876
On my way home,

11
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,086
I stop at the bakery

12
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,337
just to look.

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
And this guy dressed in a
Santa Claus suit

14
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,801
says, "Hi kid, you
like cookies?

15
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,469
I got a whole bag full."

16
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,971
And he gives them to me.

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,890
When I get home,

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,392
my mother sees the cookies

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,560
and she says,

20
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,311
"I gave you money for charity

21
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,771
and you buy Christmas food?"

22
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,774
I say, "No, somebody gave
them to me."

23
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,860
So she says, "Who?"

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,611
"Who gave you the cookies?"

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,530
And I say, "Santa Claus".

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,117
Well, she smacks me on the back
of the head

27
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,702
throws the cookies in
the garbage,

28
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
and sends me to bed.

29
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,582
The moral is, just because

30
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,750
a kid's story sounds hard
to believe

31
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,502
doesn't mean it never happened.

32
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,379
Okay?

33
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,256
Okay.

34
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,725
[background conversations]

35
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,198
Last year when my father died,

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,201
everybody in the neighborhood
came to pay their respects

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,577
to me and my mother.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,621
One of them, Polinsky,

39
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,414
the fat and creepy butcher

40
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,790
had so much respect

41
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,042
that he kept coming back.

42
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,127
First, just for coffee,

43
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,546
then, he started paying

44
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,923
his respects by taking her
to a movie

45
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,883
or a Chinese restaurant.

46
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,638
A few months later they went
to a hotel in Catskills,

47
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,681
where he respected her for
the whole weekend.

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,893
[car horn blasts]

49
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,019
A couple of months after that

50
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,646
he married her and moved
in with us.

51
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,607
Which is more respect than
I could stand.

52
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,859
[children chattering]

53
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,742
My story starts at the
beginning of summer.

54
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,203
It was a real hot day

55
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,538
but I was pretty cool.

56
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,206
I was in the meat locker

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,124
thinking about my
favorite subject...

58
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,835
sex.

59
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,379
When I was so
rudely interrupted.

60
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,714
[Polinsky] Lenny?

61
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,299
Lenny Levine?

62
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,343
Now!

63
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,222
Yes Mr. Polinsky?

64
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,350
Do you think that a lovely
woman like Mrs. Edelberg, here

65
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,018
should have to schlep a three

66
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,938
pound brisket, plus a
whole bag of

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,189
groceries from [indistinct],

68
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,358
all the way home,
on a hot day?

69
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,069
I'll carry for her.

70
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,529
Really Mr. Polinsky,

71
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,322
it's not necessary

72
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,449
Oh, necessary, necessary?

73
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,160
Is it necessary for you to
walk past

74
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,788
Leviton's meat market just
to buy from me?

75
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,998
-Hmm? Hmm?
-[giggles]

76
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,130
You don't know how lucky you are
to have Mr. Polinsky

77
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,464
as your father, oh!

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,591
He's not my father.

79
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,427
Hmm, the man who puts food
in your belly

80
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,511
and clothes on your back,

81
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,763
doesn't have to be blood to be
considered a father.

82
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,892
And who paid off the caterer
for your bar mitzvah.

83
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,354
Deeds Lenny.
Deeds make a father.

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,816
Mrs. Edelberg talks your ear off

85
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,985
then she gives you a nectarine
for a tip,

86
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,362
but I didn't mind carrying
her groceries home.

87
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,448
It gave me a chance to get out
and take in the scenery.

88
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,366
Huh, believe me,

89
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,994
The Bronx has some lovely
scenery this time or year!

90
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,080
I cry my eyes out,

91
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,999
but it's worth it makes the
brisket.

92
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,918
Not like that watery crap
they--

93
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,420
Lenny? Are you listening?

94
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:14,838
You're always so engrossed,

95
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,924
what are you thinking about
that could be so engrossing?

96
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,885
Baseball.

97
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,725
Sex.

98
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,271
Have you ever noticed that
a lot of

99
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,356
things that aren't about sex,

100
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,565
remind you of sex?

101
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,693
Lately, everything I see
reminds me of sex.

102
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,570
And I haven't even seen
real sex.

103
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:40,906
Not yet.

104
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,783
[jazzy music]

105
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,706
Lenny...

106
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,084
look at this beautiful roast!

107
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,002
I don't want any roast Ma.

108
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:55,963
I don't understand.

109
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,049
I marry a butcher and suddenly
you're a vegetarian.

110
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,968
Is this my punishment Lenny?

111
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,719
Because if it is you're only
hurting yourself.

112
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,430
Jewish boys do not eat
just vegetables.

113
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,641
You're still growing, you need
your red meat.

114
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,268
[door opens]
Shh, he's here.

115
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,602
I don't want a scene at
the table.

116
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,737
What are you doing?

117
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,158
They are, they um got, got
locked together.

118
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,410
[laughs]

119
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,870
Go throw some cold water
on them.

120
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,622
So, Lenny, were you um,

121
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,166
charming to Mrs. Edelberg
this afternoon?

122
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,127
I told her she had a nice dress.

123
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,046
Oh, good boy, good boy.

124
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,465
That's the secret to a
successful business,

125
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,301
always flatter the ladies.

126
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,636
A wink, a smile, a compliment.

127
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,932
Ah Sylvia, you look
gorgeous tonight.

128
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,392
[kissing]

129
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,061
Ah, ok stop it.
Not in front on the boy.

130
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,146
[giggling]

131
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,230
It was disgusting.

132
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,607
But I was determined

133
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,609
I was going to see two
people doing it.

134
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,944
No matter what.

135
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,949
That night while my friends
were watching Uncle Miltie

136
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,160
I set out to watch my mother

137
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,453
hump Polinsky.

138
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,288
[drum roll]

139
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,540
[door creaks open]
Given the choice

140
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,667
the people I really wanted
to see doing it

141
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,252
were Roy Rudders and
Del Evans,

142
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,754
but, you've gotta be realistic.

143
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,506
What are the odds of
Roy and Del

144
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,715
spending a night in
The Bronx.

145
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,425
My Father always said,

146
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,801
"Make the best
of what you got."

147
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,595
The best I had that night,

148
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,223
was my mother and
the fat butcher.

149
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,475
[noises from the bedroom]

150
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,601
[Polinsky] Sylvia I'm
gonna finish.

151
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,727
[Sylvia] Okay. Okay.

152
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,811
[Polinsky] Are you ready?
Are you ready--

153
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,063
I couldn't believe it, I just

154
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,439
started and he's
already finishing.

155
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,942
[Polinsky]Oh Sylvia!

156
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,401
[handle rattles]
[Sylvia] Mr. What's that?

157
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,653
[Polinsky] What, what?
I didn't hear anything.

158
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,779
-[Sylvia] That noise!
-[Polinsky] It's me, it's

159
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,113
the bed. C'mon!

160
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,240
[Sylvia] That's not a
bed sound.

161
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,116
[Polinsky speaks indistinctly]

162
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,409
[Sylvia] I'll be right back.

163
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,119
[Polinsky] Where are you going?
Where are you going? Sylvia!

164
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,538
Sylvia! C'mon!

165
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,206
I was in the middle!

166
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,290
[Lenny] Oh shit!

167
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,377
[running footsteps]

168
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,670
[door shutting]

169
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,754
[Lenny] Ow!

170
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,381
Lenny, are you alright?

171
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,217
Yeah, I, I just fell out of bed.

172
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,428
You see? You see what happens
when you don't eat meat.

173
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,806
[anticipatory music]

174
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,975
[Polinsky opens the door]

175
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,311
Aw, aw, damn.

176
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,031
I guess I should be grateful
that it wasn't Roy and Del

177
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,116
that caught me.

178
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,743
They have guns.

179
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,915
[school bell ringing]
[giggling]

180
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,041
[school teacher] Okay, good.

181
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,712
Let's see. Myrna, what do you
hope to accomplish on

182
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,963
your summer vacation?

183
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,050
I'm going to Sleepwick Camp
in Maine and I'm going

184
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,177
to learn to water-ski.

185
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,761
[Martin] Rich bitch.

186
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,056
Martin Castman, do you have
anything to add?

187
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,475
Two and two is four
Mrs. Braverman.

188
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,102
-[giggling]
-[Martin] I can add that.

189
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,605
Martin, what do you hope to
accomplish over the summer?

190
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:04,109
This summer, Mrs. Braverman,
I wanna grow armpit hair.

191
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,360
[laughing]

192
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,945
Accomplish.

193
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,574
To successfully bring about
as a result of effort.

194
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,117
To achieve a goal.

195
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,077
You're at the age where
you should have goals.

196
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,873
Everybody take out paper
and penis.

197
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,585
Lenny.

198
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,174
Lenny? Take out paper and
pencil please.

199
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,385
I know, I know, it's the last
day of school

200
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,513
but I want you to write down

201
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,224
what you plan to accomplish
this summer.

202
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,309
I will give your answers to
Mr. Kilne,

203
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,853
and he we ask you to write
a paper next year

204
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,689
in ninth grade, on how you
achieved the goals

205
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,899
you set for yourself.

206
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:44,983
Think about it.

207
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,320
What do you want to accomplish
this summer?

208
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,325
Make it good.

209
00:08:53,825 --> 00:09:00,082
[soft whimsical music]

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,084
What did you write?

211
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,878
I wanna see two people fucking.

212
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,589
[laughs] Mr. Kilne is a real
tough teacher.

213
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,258
I hope you spelt fucking right.

214
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,218
I didn't use those
words asshole.

215
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:15,180
I put, get this, I want to
witness an act of love.

216
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,475
I thought pussy plastered up
the keyhole?

217
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,854
You couldn't even witness an
act of ball scratching.

218
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,648
Well, there's a fire escape
outside the window,

219
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,733
there's mirrors, there's
millions of ways.

220
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,652
I'll figure it out.

221
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,612
I've got the whole summer.

222
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,698
What? What do you mean

223
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,449
I'm going to Aunt Norma and
Uncle Phil's house

224
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,534
for the summer?

225
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,536
I thought you'd be happy,
they have fresh air.

226
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,621
You can ride your bike without
a lot of cars around.

227
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,914
And plenty of vegetables.

228
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,041
Honey, darling your Aunt Norma
and Uncle Phil

229
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,960
got a beautiful home
in the country.

230
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,004
Ma, it's not the country,
it's Queens.

231
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,214
They have a backyard, trees.

232
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,716
I don't have any friends there.

233
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,760
You're a curious little fella,
you'll make friends,

234
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,596
besides, they need help
in the store.

235
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,764
Why? Why do they suddenly
need help?

236
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,225
Hey! Norma and Phil are
a nice couple.

237
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,519
They're a lot closer to your
age than your mother and me.

238
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,396
Go. Have a good summer.

239
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,316
I won't go and that's final.

240
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,069
[door slams]

241
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,785
[sighs]

242
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,205
[knock on door]

243
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,248
Shouldn't you be doing that
over some paper?

244
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,167
[sighs]

245
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,763
This is such a nice room.

246
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,891
I've always loved this room.

247
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,102
Lenny,

248
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,979
please don't do this for me...

249
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,607
do this for your father.

250
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,067
He is not my father.

251
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,152
No, I meant for pap.

252
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,695
Your real father.

253
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,323
You want me to go away for
the summer for pap?

254
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:58,784
He would want it.

255
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,745
He always wished he could
afford to send you

256
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,623
to camp or some place nice
for the summer.

257
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,668
A place with fresh air,
sunshine--

258
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,211
Provolone cheese.

259
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,048
You only have to work in
the deli a few hours a day.

260
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,969
Believe me, this will make
your father feel so good.

261
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,429
Ma, he's dead.

262
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,307
You know, this isn't even
about pap.

263
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,518
It's about that fat,
stupid butcher

264
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,144
he wants to get rid of me.

265
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:27,980
Honey.

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,941
Sweetheart.

267
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,443
Nobody wants to get rid of you.

268
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,530
You, me and Mort, we're
three people thrown together

269
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,656
in an apartment.

270
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,617
We need time to adjust.

271
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,619
Well fine, send Mort to Queens,

272
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:43,704
let him adjust.

273
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,956
[soft emotive music]

274
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,418
Please go.

275
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,505
Your Aunt Norma is family.

276
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,465
You're her only nephew,

277
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,259
she'll take very good
care of you.

278
00:11:58,844 --> 00:11:59,887
What about Uncle Phil?

279
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,346
You said he's guinea
[indistinct]

280
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,431
who plays the horses.

281
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,891
You want me hanging
around him?

282
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,603
He's also a good provider
for my sister

283
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,605
and that's the part you'll
hang around.

284
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,150
And I never said guinea.

285
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,777
I said Italian.

286
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,488
He's an Italian yutz.

287
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:21,825
Aw.

288
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,160
I knew she meant well.

289
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,662
Plus, Norma and Phil just
got married so

290
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,788
there'll be plenty of screwing.

291
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,290
I decided to go.

292
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,709
My Aunt Norma was nice,

293
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,295
but by the time she turned 32,
the whole

294
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,297
family was betting that she
would wind up an old maid.

295
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:37,716
Thirty-two?

296
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,511
They must have thrown some
party when she got married.

297
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,888
No party.
He's not Jewish.

298
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,431
He's Italian Cath.

299
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,767
Seen those really
hairy Italians?

300
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,393
Yeah.

301
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,853
Yeah, I heard those guys
are real studs.

302
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,147
He's gonna bang her brains out
morning, noon and night.

303
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:55,234
You're gonna write some paper
for Mr. Kilne.

304
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,818
[car horn]

305
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,570
Lenny, okay?

306
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,905
Hello Aunt Norma.

307
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:04,159
Uh ha! I've changed my name
Anty Normous, is that funny?

308
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,037
Do I know Italian folklore
or what.

309
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,667
That's my new brother-in-law.

310
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,586
Ma, you never told me Aunt Norma
was pregnant?

311
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,380
I never told you.

312
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,465
Who am I? Walter Winter
with the news?

313
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,842
[laughs] Sylvia.

314
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,385
Darling!

315
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,720
-[giggling]
-Hello Sylvia.

316
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,139
Hello Phil, how are you?

317
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,600
Fine. Just fine.

318
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,061
Hey, look at my new car!

319
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,230
I always wanted my baby sister

320
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,857
to be married to a man with
a car like that.

321
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,235
It's a veritable dream come
true for me, Phil.

322
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,282
Sylvia darling,
is that your sister?

323
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,992
The new bride?

324
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,786
You never told me she
was pregnant!

325
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,206
I shouted it from the roof top
last Thursday.

326
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,791
You must have been out.

327
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,419
Norma, Mrs. Glantz.

328
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,088
Hello, I'm Norma De Lorenzo.

329
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,840
De Lorenzo?

330
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,843
I knew a Mrs. De Benedetto once.

331
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,262
Her husband was a drunk.

332
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,145
-[Norma] So where are his bags?
-[Sylvia] Mort's got them.

333
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,063
You have enough to deal with
right now.

334
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,607
Hey, Lenny is that your bike?

335
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,443
Yeah, pap bought it for me
two years ago

336
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,527
from another kid.

337
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,279
It's em... nice.

338
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,282
I tell you what I think it's
scratch up

339
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,700
the automobile, so um...

340
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,036
listen, I've got an extra
bike at the store

341
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,621
we use for deliveries,
why don't you use that?

342
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,835
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Okay, good.

343
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,128
Normie, let's go.

344
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,505
Alright sweetie.

345
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,089
Go easy, go easy.

346
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,174
Lenny.

347
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,302
You're going to have a
wonderful summer,

348
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,095
and when you get back things
will be smoother,

349
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,180
I promise.

350
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,015
I love you.

351
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,812
Now be a good boy,

352
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,523
and don't let your Aunt Norma
work too hard.

353
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,316
Shake hands with...

354
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,651
your Stepfather.

355
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,320
[sad music]

356
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,685
Our little trip to the country

357
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,854
ended on a dead end street

358
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,564
called "133rd Avenue".

359
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,648
[Norma] Oh, this is our home.

360
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,525
No cows, no horses,

361
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,068
no general stores.

362
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:44,736
It looked like Queens to me.

363
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,697
[laughing]

364
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,198
[Norma] You know what he
says Lenny,

365
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,658
I'm a back street driver.

366
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,410
-[Phil] Get out of here alright.
-[Norma] Even in the front seat.

367
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,120
-[Norma grunts]
-[Phil] Come on, there you go.

368
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,330
[Norma sighs]

369
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,124
So here we are.
Home sweet home.

370
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,710
Sweet home, sweet home.

371
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,545
Phil always says that

372
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,255
because all the houses
look alike.

373
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,132
Alright you guys get the bags

374
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,758
out of the car, I'll
start dinner.

375
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,051
Lenny, sweetie, I hope
your hungry

376
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,304
'cos Phil brought home enough
food to feed the neighborhood!

377
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,930
Welcome to Queens!

378
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,516
Hey, I've put a radio in your
room so you can listen

379
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,809
to the ball game.
Do you like baseball?

380
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:17,853
Yeah.

381
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,646
Yankees, right?

382
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,481
Dodgers.

383
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,943
You're from The Bronx,
you root for Brooklyn?

384
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,446
What do you friends think
about that?

385
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,704
Okay. Good, this is um, good

386
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,789
I really feel like we're
getting warmer here.

387
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,418
Listen...

388
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,086
do you not like me because

389
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,171
your mother doesn't like me

390
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,923
or do you just not like me
on your own?

391
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,592
I don't, not like you.

392
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
But your mother doesn't like me
because I'm Italian, right?

393
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,223
No, she doesn't like you because

394
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,307
you're not Jewish.

395
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,391
There's the difference.

396
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,353
Yeah well that butcher's Jewish

397
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,938
you sure as hell don't like him,

398
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,272
that I can tell! [laughs]

399
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,107
Yeah.

400
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,527
I hate his guts.

401
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,656
Yeah, he's a flaming asshole,

402
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,740
isn't he?

403
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,575
Yeah. [giggles]

404
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,331
I never really knew your

405
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,083
real dad, you know.

406
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,253
Yeah, you would have liked him.

407
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,505
He was a Dodger fan too.

408
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,756
No kidding?

409
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:28,966
Which team do you root for?

410
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,884
What you're kidding?

411
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,177
This city's got three teams,

412
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,263
the Yankees, the Dodgers
and the Giants,

413
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,139
I've only got one Italian deli

414
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,308
whoever I root for I piss off
two thirds of my customers

415
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:39,810
so...

416
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:40,894
[car boot shuts]

417
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,605
Me? I only root for Italians

418
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,315
Go Rosutto,

419
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,859
go Farillo, go...

420
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,443
Cappinello.

421
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,570
What?

422
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,488
Cappinello's not Italian
he's colored.

423
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,073
[indistinct chatter]

424
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,825
What the fuck do my
customers know?

425
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,535
Oh shit, do you mind if
I say fuck?

426
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,370
I mean, I figured your
thirteen you must have

427
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,038
-heard it by now.
-I'm almost was fourteen.

428
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:01,999
No kidding!

429
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,001
-Fourteen?
-Yeah.

430
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,294
Do wanna borrow the
car tomorrow?

431
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,628
Yeah!

432
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,547
Yeah? Fat fucking chance kiddo.

433
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:09,798
Get in there, let's go.

434
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,927
[Phil sings in Italian]

435
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:17,890
Hey Lenny?

436
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,851
Take your BBQ like this in
The Bronx son?

437
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,935
Am I right or am I wrong?

438
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,145
How about more sausage?

439
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,063
No thanks Uncle Phil,
four's plenty.

440
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,273
And two hamburgers, are you

441
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,774
sure you don't want any
vegetables with that?

442
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:29,568
No thanks Aunt Norma.

443
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,447
Hiya Norma, Phil.

444
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,782
Johnny, how you doing?

445
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,367
Pretty good.

446
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,077
That's my nephew over
there Lenny,

447
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,162
Lenny Levine.

448
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,622
Johnny Zarkotoli,

449
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,998
he lives next door.

450
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,416
Until I kill him for jumping

451
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,084
over the fence and ruining
my flowers.

452
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,003
Remember I told you to use
the driveway?

453
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,756
Johnny go around, go around.

454
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,716
Sorry.

455
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,303
-Hi.
-Hi.

456
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:57,513
Lenny is spending the summer

457
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,056
with us. This is John who works

458
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,140
in Phil's deli.

459
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,225
Off the books.

460
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,602
Yo, err... you know what I'm

461
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:04,853
gonna take him down the
store tomorrow,

462
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,897
show him the ropes, and maybe
you can show him around?

463
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,607
Introduce to some of the kids
in neighborhood.

464
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,484
I tell you what, Norma let's

465
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,152
go inside and get the dessert
then these two guys

466
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:13,737
can get to know each
other alright.

467
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,821
-Good idea.
-Alright.

468
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,281
-You getting out of there ok?
-Yes.

469
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,495
Hey John,

470
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:22,704
I've got that strawberry

471
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:24,081
short cake, you like
that right?

472
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,541
Yeah.

473
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,127
Phil's a nice guy.

474
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,046
Must be neat to have him
for an uncle.

475
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:32,798
Yeah, I haven't had him that

476
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,091
long, but I er, I like him.

477
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,843
You know he's not like a
regular grown up.

478
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,428
I have two uncles,
Greg and Steedy.

479
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:39,930
Greg's a cheap sonofabitch

480
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,056
and Steedy's a drunk.

481
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,726
You wanna do something after
work tomorrow?

482
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,229
I dunno.

483
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,022
What do you guys do around here?

484
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,607
Not much, ride bikes.

485
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,026
I don't have a bike yet

486
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,195
but er, Phil said he's got
and extra one in the store.

487
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:56,572
Oh here it is, I got it,
I got it.

488
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,407
It's a piece of crap olla.

489
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,327
Maybe we should just go off
to the school yard

490
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,412
and play some baseball.

491
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm not that good at baseball,
but, uh, how about stoop ball?

492
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,378
Kids around here...
don't play stoop ball.

493
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,548
You know, my mother convinced me
to spend the summer here.

494
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,050
She said there'd be tons
of interesting stuff to do.

495
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,427
You know, just like camp.

496
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:20,971
Don't you guys do anything
interesting around here?

497
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,015
Yeah.

498
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,558
What?

499
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,811
You promise you won't tell
Phil or anybody?

500
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,479
Yeah.

501
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:33,650
I swear.

502
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,281
We have a sex club.

They didn't do anything
that night.

They didn't hug,
they didn't kiss,

515

they didn't even shake hands,
believe me.

00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,930
[mumbles] I'll give her
a fresh salami.

540
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,474
You gotta think big boys.

541
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,812
Think big, live big, slice thin.

542
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,692
♪ Doria Dore take your sister
Off the floor ♪

543
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:39,985
Come on, we got to stock.

544
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,989
[Lenny] John hadn't said a word
about the sex club all morning.

545
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,034
I decided it was time that work
it into the conversation.

546
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,703
So, uh, who's the president?

547
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,580
Hike.

548
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,249
-Who?
-President Heisner.

549
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,417
What, do you think I'm stupid?

550
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,171
No, I mean who's the president
of the sex club?

551
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,964
We don't have a president.

552
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,843
-You got jackets?
-[derisive laugh] Jackets?

553
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,888
[laughs] I got to tell that one
to Alice.

554
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,434
Alice! Who the hell is Alice?

555
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,648
[John] Hey, let me just
tell you this.

556
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,818
The best thing about working
for Phil is the free lunch.

557
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,030
Yeah. I never had a ham
in Swiss like this before.

558
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,783
Actually, I've never had a ham
in anything before.

559
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,996
Wow! That's a new bike.

560
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,416
Thanks. I got it last Christmas.

561
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,252
Cost me a $100.

562
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,213
Can I ride it one time?

563
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,008
I'm not supposed to lend it,
but I'll ask my father.

564
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,555
Yeah, my father died
last September.

565
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,099
I know. Norma told me,
so I wouldn't say

566
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,017
anything stupid.
[car horn honks]

567
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:56,979
Johnny!

568
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,358
Johnny, I'm late for work.

569
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,361
-Hi Miss Colia.
-Sweety, I'm shamefully late.

570
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,822
Get this grocery list to Phil
and deliver it to my house.

571
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,490
You know where the key is.

572
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:10,868
[Colia] And put a spoil boost
up in the fridge and--

573
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,412
And the bananas in the freezer,
I know.

574
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,454
Thanks.

575
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,748
This is for you.

576
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,835
-Who's the new kid?
-[John] This is Phil's nephew

577
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:21,670
Lenny. He's here for the summer.

578
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,298
Oh. Hi Lenny!

579
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,342
[soft music]

580
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,312
Oh, tell Guido not to cut
from the hens.

581
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,903
-Who was that?
-Hedy Colia.

582
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,905
Her real name is Hedy Coletti.

583
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,866
-Colia is her model name.
-She's a model?

584
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,118
Oh yeah! And a nurse.

585
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,287
But since I've known her,
she's mostly a nurse.

586
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,333
But... she used to model bras.

587
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,544
You're kidding. She lets guys
take pictures of her boobs

588
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,755
-just like that?
-Is that incredible?

589
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,341
Plus she's a great tipper.
She gives me a buck

590
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,218
just for delivering
her groceries to her house.

591
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,095
So, uh, Johnny...

592
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,264
you're going to put your head
in her bra?

593
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,683
[whimsical music]

594
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,653
It's called the weeds.
The guy who developed this block

595
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,029
was supposed to turn
it into a park.

596
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,657
-But he ran out of town.
-Too bad.

597
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,500
-How far is Hedy's house?
-Oh, about ten feet.

598
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,755
[Lenny] Your kidding!
She models bras

599
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,132
-and she lives on our block.
-My block.

600
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,968
You're just here for the summer.

601
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,889
[Johnny] Six and seven.

602
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,600
Seventh pot from the left.

603
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:00,227
You're going to split
that dollar with me

604
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,812
for helping you deliver
these groceries?

605
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,773
Yeah, but I'm charging you ¢50
for a tour of the house.

606
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,239
Wow!

607
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,742
[Lenny] It's like a magazine.
Never seen furniture like this

608
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,785
in real life.

609
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:18,537
Come on.

610
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,627
Hey, peel these and put them
in the freezer.

611
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:35,929
What do you think
she does with these?

612
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,599
I think she eats them.

613
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:44,938
Yeah, well I think she likes
them big, fat and hard. [laughs]

614
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,402
I hope she likes
them circumcised.

615
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:51,904
[both giggling]

616
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,530
Oh, oh!

617
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,077
[soft fantasy music]

618
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,924
-Oh my God!
-It gets better.

619
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,975
Oh my God!

620
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,979
-Tits.
-[Johnny laughs]

621
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,191
Oh Lenny! I want to have sex
with you so much.

622
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:31,193
I'll have to think about it.

623
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,279
[Johnny] Oh please, take me back
to Brooklyn with you.

624
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:35,864
It's the Bronx.

625
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,659
[Johnny] I don't care. Just give
me a big orgasm.

626
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,245
-A big what?
-[laughs]

627
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,082
-Come on, we got to go.
-Where're we going?

628
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,375
Alice's house.

629
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,336
[whimsical music]

630
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:16,822
What's the matter?

631
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:21,660
OK... OK, what to do you
actually do in the sex club?

632
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,538
-We talk about sex.
-With girls?

633
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:26,748
Yeah, they know a lot.

634
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,002
Especially Alice. She told me
a ton of good stuff.

635
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,006
-Is that all? This soft?
-Yeah.

636
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,341
You could show Alice
your dick if you want.

637
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,177
She always asks if she could
see mine.

638
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,095
-Did you show it to her?
-No.

639
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,972
It's not ready to be seen.

640
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,058
Mine either.

641
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,248
[Lenny] John never told me
there'd be two of them.

642
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,168
I figured out it must've been
the one with the reddish hair.

643
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,504
Because the girl
with the glasses didn't look

644
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,172
like she knew anything
about sex.

645
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,424
Boy! Did I get that one wrong?

646
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,844
-Hi John.
-Hi, this is Lenny.

647
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,306
Lenny, this is Alice Moran
and Barbara Staburweenie.

648
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,849
[angrily] Sabatini.

649
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,643
-Hi.
-Hi.

650
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:29,853
Lenny, you're the one
who's staying

651
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,396
with the De Lorenzo's
for the summer right?

652
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,982
Right. How did you know that?

653
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:36,109
She knows everything
about everybody.

654
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:37,861
Her mother own a beauty parlor.

655
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:39,988
All the women talk about
their personal lives.

656
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,699
Your aunt Norma blabbed
all about you.

657
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,159
What did she say?

658
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,621
You live in the Bronx,
your father died, you're Jewish.

659
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,249
-And you masturbate every night.
-[giggles]

660
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:51,625
I do not.

661
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:53,877
I do.

662
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:55,671
[both chuckling]

663
00:29:57,798 --> 00:29:59,091
[Lenny] Did you see what I mean?

664
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,968
I never met a girl
who even said masturbate.

665
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,803
This one did it
and told you about it.

666
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:06,265
I got excited.
You know, excited.

667
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,602
So, uh, who's in this club?

668
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,730
Just me and Barbara
and any other boy that we see

669
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,983
-can be in it.
-So far, we let in John.

670
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,652
And one Ralphie Palumbo,
we had to kick Ralphie out,

671
00:30:18,694 --> 00:30:20,863
because he told
his mother. [laughs]

672
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,573
Can I be in for this summer?

673
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,535
As long as you understand
that we just talk about it.

674
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,203
We don't do it.
We're catholic.

675
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,456
Especially Barbara.
She's very catholic.

676
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,209
I-I don't do it either.

677
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:35,961
I wouldn't want to get
anyone pregnant.

678
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,589
You couldn't get Barbara
pregnant anyway.

679
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:42,176
-She hasn't had her period yet.
-Alice! God!

680
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,136
Her what?

681
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,263
Her period.

682
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,101
Oh God! Doesn't this kid
know anything?

683
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:56,023
Walk! Lenny, I can understand
you don't know a lot about sex,

684
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,359
but this is something we learnt
in seventh grade hygiene.

685
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,320
Hey, I took shop
in seventh grade, OK.

686
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,822
You tell me what a period is
and I'll teach you how to build

687
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:04,865
a magazine rack.

688
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:06,950
[laughs]

689
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:09,411
Every month, women have
a menstrual cycle

690
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:12,748
and they bleed. It's also
called the curse.

691
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,791
What do you mean bleed?

692
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,628
Do you at least know
what a vagina is?

693
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,380
Yeah. I mean, Jews call it
something else,

694
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,090
but uh, if you want
to use the medical term.

695
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,760
That's where women bleed from.

696
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,805
Are you sure this isn't
just like a local thing?

697
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,891
Because I don't think women
in The Bronx have curses.

698
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,100
I would've heard about it.

699
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,603
-[giggles]
-No, it happens to all of them.

700
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,064
It means your eggs dropping
and you could get pregnant.

701
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:38,690
I got mine at 12.

702
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,693
Barbara's 15,
she's dying to get it.

703
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,695
Sounds awful.
Why would you want it?

704
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,948
Could we talk
about something else, please?

705
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:48,575
Alice, tell Lenny about the time
you saw your parents doing it.

706
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:50,369
Doing it?

707
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,121
When I was ten years old,
I woke up

708
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,706
in the middle of the night
and I went to their room.

709
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,501
They were doing it
in the machinery position.

710
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:59,837
The machinery position?

711
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,881
Wow! I didn't know Catholics
had their own position.

712
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,383
What's it called
when Jewish people do it?

713
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:06,969
[both laugh]

714
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,096
Machinery position
is for everybody,

715
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:11,723
it's when the mans on top
and the women's on bottom.

716
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,267
What did I tell ya?

717
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,893
She know all kinds of stuff
like that.

718
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,563
Uh, excuse us a minute.

719
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:18,730
[girls giggling]

720
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,276
What does she mean it
when the man goes on top?

721
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:23,318
The man goes on top!

722
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,904
There's different ways to do it.
Sometimes the woman

723
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:26,905
can be on top.

724
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,200
Hey, come on, let's go.

725
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,745
[Barbara and Alice whispering]

726
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,084
-So, what did it look like?
-I already told you.

727
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:41,795
No, no, no, I mean,
what did it look like?

728
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,216
Um... I couldn't watch
for too long,

729
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,718
because I didn't want
to get caught.

730
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,513
But it doesn't look like a bee
upon eating a flower

731
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:52,556
which is what they tell you.

732
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,226
It's more like a wrestling match
on TV.

733
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,105
Only they're naked
and it's not two men

734
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,690
and there's no referee.

735
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,486
I guess you have to see
it for yourself.

736
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,573
I'm gonna. I'm going to watch
Norma and Phil.

737
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,408
-Whoa!
-Probably tonight.

738
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,160
-No, you're not.

739
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,495
I'm so. I got it all
planned out.

740
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,289
Norma and Phil
can't do it anymore.

741
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,458
Of course they can.
He got her pregnant, didn't he?

742
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,169
Norma told my mother last week,
her doctor said,

743
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:24,046
she couldn't have anymore
intercourse till after

744
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,088
the baby's born.

745
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,509
-What? Why not?
-I know why.

746
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,094
Because the baby will bite off
Phil's dick from the inside.

747
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,179
[laughing]

748
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:33,597
That's not it.

749
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:35,557
If you screw after
the seventh month,

750
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,017
you're going to get contractions
and the baby

751
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,060
could be born premature.

752
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:40,687
Is she right?

753
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,316
Oh my God, no!

754
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,734
[sighs]

755
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,278
[upbeat jazz music]

756
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,114
[Lenny] What a set back!

757
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,911
Lucky for me. The rest
of the summer was going great.

758
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,830
I really like my new uncle.

759
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,582
[upbeat jazz music continues]

760
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,231
Phil taught me lots of stuff
he said it was important

761
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,274
for men to know.

762
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:28,068
His advice was always clear
and easy to understand.

763
00:34:30,487 --> 00:34:31,989
Alice taught me lots
of stuff too,

764
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,199
but her advice
was a little fussier.

765
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,869
Women can have two kinds
of orgasms.

766
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,537
Real or fake.

767
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:40,122
How do you tell the difference?

768
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,790
[Alice and Barbara laughing]

769
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,919
So, what's the big deal
if you see two people doing it.

770
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:47,337
It was my goal for the summer.

771
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:49,631
And my father always told me,
"Set a goal for yourself

772
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:50,799
and stick to it."

773
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:51,967
He says it's the only way
you're going to get

774
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,010
ahead in life.

775
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,053
So, does it have to be
Norma and Phil.

776
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,471
No.

777
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,183
Why don't you sleep over
at my house one night?

778
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,268
Maybe, my mom and dad
would do it for you.

779
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:02,936
If they knew it would help
you get ahead in life.

780
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:05,647
Thanks a lot.

781
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:08,358
What did your dad do?

782
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,277
He sold shoes at Thom McAn's.

783
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:11,862
[John] That's a pretty good job.

784
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:14,823
Yeah, but I don't think
it's really what he

785
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,450
-wanted to do.
-How do you know?

786
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,785
Maybe, his goal was to look up
at lot of women's dresses.

787
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,247
Guys, you got to come with me.

788
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,333
What's up?

789
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,668
Emergency sex club meeting.

790
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,420
Barbara's got something
to show you.

791
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,632
-[Alice] It just happened.
-She got her period, no!

792
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:34,510
-I don't want to see it.
-No, it's not that.

793
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:35,636
It's.

794
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,014
[fast paced music]

795
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:57,324
-[Alice] Look at this.
-[John] Oh my gosh!

796
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:58,825
[Lenny] Look at this,
oh my goodness!

797
00:35:58,867 --> 00:35:59,910
Look at her, look at her!

798
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,578
Oh my gosh!
Where did you see this?

799
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,996
I was putting away the laundry
and I found it

800
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:04,456
in my father's sock drawer.

801
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,083
John look at the size
of those tit.

802
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,252
I bet stab you whinny
with like tits like those.

803
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,004
[Lenny] I can't believe it.
A comic book were

804
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,674
all the characters are screwing
and humping in everything.

805
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:16,385
Mr. Sabatini must've had
it tried on 100 superman's

806
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,469
for this one.

807
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,264
-[Alice] Jeez!
-Oh!

808
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,890
If the church had found out
your father had this,

809
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,642
he'd been excommunicated.

810
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,478
-He's a real pervert.
-I wish my father was a pervert.

811
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,563
Turn the page.

812
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,482
Jeez! Look at the boner
on that guy.

813
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,776
-Careful, don't crip it.
-[woman] Hey, you kids!

814
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,571
What're you guys up to?

815
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,406
[all] Oh, nothing, nothing!

816
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,657
I'm on the night shift
this week,

817
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:39,950
so keep the noise down.

818
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,870
-Okay.
-Alright. Good night.

819
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,038
-[all] Good night.
-Let's get out of here.

820
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,670
[Barbara] Alice, what am I going
to do with this thing?

821
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,505
[Alice] Just put it back
in your fathers drawer.

822
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,591
[girls chattering]

823
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:02,014
What?

824
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,642
[soft music]

825
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,274
Oh my God!

826
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,903
[Lenny] When I looked up
and saw her reflected

827
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:19,573
in those mirrors... I knew
right then there was a God.

828
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,533
And he had led me
to the promise land.

829
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,036
Before the summer was over,
I was going to watch

830
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:25,621
Hedy Colia bang her brains out.

831
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:28,540
And I knew exactly
how I was going to do it.

832
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:34,838
Shh.

833
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,012
Come here.

834
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,848
What did your mom say?

835
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:47,226
My mom doesn't do Hedy's hair
but she does Ms. Samuel's

836
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,770
-who exhort Hedy.
-So, what did Ms. Samuel say?

837
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,315
Ms. Samuel says--
god I feel like Nancy Drew,

838
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,317
-girl attacked him.
-Alice come on.

839
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,779
Mrs. Samuel says that Hedy
is romantically active.

840
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,739
I bet that means she puts out.

841
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,119
Thank you John.

842
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,705
-Who with?
-Some guy whose car

843
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,040
has MD empty license plates.

844
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,043
-I bet he's a doctor.
-A doctor?

845
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:15,671
Why didn't I think of it?
Thank you John.

846
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,008
Okay... so I know
she's doing it.

847
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,385
Do you know when?

848
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,679
Yeah Lenny, we asked for her
screwing calendar

849
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,013
and she gave it to us.

850
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:26,098
[man hems]

851
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:34,314
She probably does it at night.
That's when they all do it.

852
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,024
Okay, we'll figure it out.

853
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,235
But in the meanwhile
I found this book.

854
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,405
-Bird watching?
-Yeah.

855
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:44,032
The larger breasted
Hedica lady bird.

856
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,244
[music playing]

857
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:52,666
[Lenny] A quarter pound
of Genoa salami.

858
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,085
And four slices
of Swiss cheese, thin.

859
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,837
But now from this side,
too many holes.

860
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,256
Thank you Mrs. Crescetelli.

861
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,217
And may I say,
you look lovely today.

862
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:05,053
Thank you Lenny.
I wish everybody treated

863
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,181
their best customer so nice
like you.

864
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,229
-Hello Ms. Colia and may I say--
-Oh, let me guess.

865
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:17,149
I look lovely today.
Me and Mrs. Crescetelli.

866
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,111
Uh, actually... you look better.

867
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:24,198
Huh-uh. Let me see
if you're as good as slicing ham

868
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,240
as your baloney.

869
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:28,076
I'll take half a pound
of boiled ham, please.

870
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:30,287
Got it.

871
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:32,539
So, you're enjoying your summer?

872
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:35,125
Uh, yes Ms. Colia.

873
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,252
I think you can call me Hedy.

874
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,756
Oh. Yeah, I'm having
a great summer, Hedy.

875
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,426
-But uh, I miss school.
-You do?

876
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,012
Yeah, I love studying.

877
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,597
[Lenny] I mean, I already know
what I'm going to be

878
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,640
when I grow up.

879
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,183
-Yeah.
-A doctor.

880
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,020
-Huh. No kidding, my boyfriend
is a doctor.

881
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,814
Really? What kind?

882
00:39:58,524 --> 00:39:59,525
OBGYN.

883
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,695
Obgyn? What's an obgyn?

884
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:08,867
No. OBGYN, Obstetrics
and Gynecology.

885
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,662
-[Hedy] He delivers babies.
-Cool.

886
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,665
I-I'd love to meet him.

887
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,543
Oh, he's coming to the block
party on Saturday.

888
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,627
I'll introduce you guys.

889
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,421
His name is Dr. Flynn,
Donald Flynn.

890
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,049
Alright.

891
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,554
[Lenny] It was looking good.
I figured a guy who knew

892
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,596
how to deliver babies.

893
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,807
Probably knew a thing or three
about how to make them.

894
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:36,353
Here you go Hedy. May I say,
you look lovely today.

895
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:39,731
Oh, you're good,
you're very good.

896
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:41,608
See you later.

897
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,110
-[Phil] Ciao Hedy.
-[Hedy] Ciao.

898
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,782
[Lenny] I had the perfect plan.

899
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,534
And I was ready
for the block party.

900
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,245
I just didn't figure
on the block hit.

901
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,627
Lenny! Was I right
or was I right?

902
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,087
Hello Phil with your cigar.

903
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:03,839
[Sylvia] Was I right
that you'll have a fabulous

904
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,591
vacation. You look gorgeous.

905
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,552
-[Mort] Phil, how're you?
-Hello, I'm Lenny's mother.

906
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,679
-You must be a new friend.
-I'm John.

907
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,098
-Nice to meet you Mrs. Levine.
-It's Mrs. Polinsky.

908
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,809
-What's your last name John?
-He's not Jewish mom.

909
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:17,853
I only promised
you'd make friends.

910
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:20,355
I didn't specify racist,
religions or creeds.

911
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,817
Hey, uh, you bought a car uh?

912
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,237
So, uh, what do you think Lenny?

913
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,991
-It's a green Chevy.
-Hope you like green Chevy.

914
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:32,242
This is your new car.

915
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,454
-Can I drive it?
-In a couple of years.

916
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,123
The it's your new car.

917
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,417
-How was the ride?
-It was horrible.

918
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,960
-Traffic?
-He doesn't drive it correctly.

919
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,088
[Lenny] Come on John,
we go to go.

920
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,299
-Bye mom.
-Come in the house

921
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,676
and freshen up.
Not that you need it.

922
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,762
If you do as good
with this child

923
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,430
as you're doing with Lenny,
you'll be in the mother's

924
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,724
-hall of fame.
-He misses you both like crazy.

925
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,059
I'm so glad you could come.

926
00:41:57,893 --> 00:41:59,728
So Phil,
what's the shindig about?

927
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,356
You see those weeds
down at the end of the block?

928
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,025
We're going to raise a little
money to make a nice park.

929
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:08,487
So, tell me about
Lenny's summer.

930
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,698
He's a great kid. He's a big
help with the store too.

931
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:13,909
He's made friends,
he took up bird watching.

932
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,787
Birds! Since when does Lenny
like birds?

933
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,248
He's serious too. He even
borrowed my binoculars.

934
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,250
Binoculars?

935
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,877
Good ones too. You're out
16 bucks if he drops them.

936
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,929
[casual music]

937
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,488
[laughs]

938
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,740
Why, that little pervert!

939
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,702
[upbeat music]

940
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,068
-Where have you guys been?
-Lenny's parents showed up.

941
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,946
Not parents, mother
and some fat jerk

942
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,072
in a green Chevy.

943
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,200
-Where're the binoculars?
-[Lenny shushes]

944
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:38,160
-I hid them in the weeds.
-Can me and Barbara watch

945
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,244
with you?

946
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:41,413
You want four people taking
turns looking

947
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,290
into her bedroom window?
You know what,

948
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,209
why don't we just open up
a booth and sell tickets.

949
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:48,587
Yeah Barbara, I bet your father
would pay. [laughs]

950
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,718
Look, alright, if it works
this time we'll bring you guys

951
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,345
-with us next time.
-What makes you think

952
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:57,346
I even want to?

953
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:58,972
Yeah.

954
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:02,142
Women.

955
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,937
[Hedy] Johnny, Lenny!

956
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:06,772
[background chatter]

957
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,613
You guys ready for desert?

958
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,824
Desert! What do you have?

959
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,036
Charlotte Russe, only ¢20.

960
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,085
You made these?
They're great.

961
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:30,504
I bought them
at Amsterdam's bakery.

962
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:32,214
Don't tell anybody.

963
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:33,799
[clears throat]

964
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:37,094
So, uh, where's your friend,
Dr. Flynn?

965
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,388
Oh, I thought he'd be here
by now,

966
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,848
but he had a baby to deliver.

967
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,351
-Hello!
-Hi.

968
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,604
[Hedy] I'm Hedy Colia.
You're new in the neighborhood?

969
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:50,065
No, no, just visiting.
Mort Polinsky.

970
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,651
[Mort] I'm uh...
I'm Lenny's stepfather.

971
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,864
That's a lovely outfit
you have on, Hedy.

972
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,367
And your... cream puffs
looks delicious.

973
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:02,619
Thank you.

974
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,623
Lenny darling, Norma wants you
and John to help at her table

975
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,166
for a while so she can rest.

976
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,252
Uh, ma, this is my friend
Hedy Colia.

977
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:13,046
How do you do?
Sylvia Polinsky.

978
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,757
Hi, you have the sweetest son.

979
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:18,385
-He's so helpful.
-[Sylvia laughs]

980
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,771
Hello.

981
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,607
-Hi.
-Hi.

982
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,199
It's a girl. Six pounds,
ten ounces.

983
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,783
-[Hedy] Oh!
-And I'm starving.

984
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:43,744
-Look.
-Ooh!

985
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,954
[laughs]

986
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,417
Oh.

987
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:55,214
Don, Don, this is John
and this is Lenny,

988
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:56,715
the young man I was telling
you about.

989
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,218
-And these are his parents.
-[Flynn] Nice to meet you, hi.

990
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,470
So, you want to be
a doctor, huh?

991
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:03,263
Lenny, a doctor?

992
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,933
Pinch me! It's wonderful,
since when?

993
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,059
Ma, please.

994
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:14,024
Oh-oh Sylvia, they're playing
a song, come on let's mambo.

995
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:17,861
Lenny I'll catch you later.

996
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,907
[jazz music]

997
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:47,850
[Lenny] I wonder
what they're saying?

998
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:51,436
[John] Probably, oh baby, baby,
baby! Let's do it now,

999
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,021
so Lenny and John can watch.

1000
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:05,868
Do you want to dance?

1001
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:11,874
Sure.

1002
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:18,839
[Lenny] I don't even know
how to dance.

1003
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,300
I just wanted to get closer
to Hedy.

1004
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,141
You're being a real jerk
about Hedy.

1005
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:30,851
What do you mean?

1006
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:34,062
I don't understand why it's so
important to see her screwing.

1007
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:35,814
Shh, she'll hear you.

1008
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:39,193
You already saw lots of screwing
in Barbara's father's book.

1009
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,737
Comic books don't count, Alice.

1010
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:44,990
I think you should wait until...

1011
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:47,826
Till what?

1012
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,829
I don't know... till you do it
with some girl.

1013
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:53,874
I mean, you're sort
of good looking.

1014
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:55,918
I bet some girl would
do it with you.

1015
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:58,629
What girl?

1016
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,301
I don't know any Jewish girls.
I go to catholic school.

1017
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,763
She could be catholic.

1018
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:16,146
I... well... catholic girls
don't do it.

1019
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:17,940
Lenny!

1020
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:23,445
Wish me luck. We got to go.

1021
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,421
-Oh! There they are.
-Lie down.

1022
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,881
They can't see me.

1023
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:46,176
[John] Lie down!
What if we get caught?

1024
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,220
What would they do,
beat us with a frozen banana?

1025
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:49,972
You're going back to the Bronx
in a month,

1026
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:51,014
but I still have to live here.

1027
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:54,351
-I'm getting out of here.
-You're such a pussy.

1028
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:56,687
You're never going to have
a chance like this again.

1029
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,648
-You're right.
-Yeah.

1030
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,024
I'm a pussy. See you later.

1031
00:49:11,952 --> 00:49:13,161
[Lenny] Come on,
turn her around.

1032
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,038
Turn around.

1033
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,333
Oh my gosh!

1034
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,088
-Hey!
-[screams]

1035
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:25,132
Come on out of there!

1036
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,137
What the hell were you doing
in there?

1037
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,807
-I was watching for birds.
-It's night time.

1038
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,602
-I always watch for owls.
-Owls?

1039
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:38,228
Yeah.

1040
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,273
Hoodious, Twistious, Anakus.

1041
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,609
Come on, give me
those binoculars.

1042
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,986
-Don't drop it.
-Okay.

1043
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,993
What was that kid looking at?

1044
00:49:55,037 --> 00:49:56,747
[whimsical music]

1045
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,004
That little peeping Tom.

1046
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,097
Hey you pervert!

1047
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,016
[laughs]

1048
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,103
-You're sick.
-No, no, it was--

1049
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,439
That's some example to set
for your son.

1050
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,818
Hedy told me you got fresh
with her.

1051
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:28,445
Fresh? I gave her a compliment.

1052
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,572
Cream puff ah?
I'll give you cream puff

1053
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,449
-you sick bastard.
-Please, let me explain.

1054
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,743
-Just want to say one thing.
-Be my guest.

1055
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:36,912
[gasps]

1056
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:40,874
[sighs]

1057
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:44,586
I brought you some more ice.

1058
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:46,588
-Oh!
-Darling.

1059
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:48,924
Oh! Sylvia, Sylvia, look.

1060
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,218
The ice is killing me,
enough already.

1061
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:53,011
Oh my god!

1062
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:55,889
Can I get you a drink
or something?

1063
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,057
No drinks.

1064
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:58,725
[Sylvia] First, I want to find
out what happened.

1065
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,602
You want to know what happened,
I'll tell you what happened.

1066
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,229
I went looking for Lenny.

1067
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:05,399
So, I went to that jungle
where you're going to build

1068
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,900
a park and I found him.

1069
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,862
Down more to the ground
with those binoculars.

1070
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,239
So, I turned around to see
what he was looking at and...

1071
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:19,413
bam, I got hit in the eye
with a tree branch.

1072
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,539
[Norma and Phil giggle]

1073
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:23,709
One day in the country
and you get hit in the eye

1074
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,377
with a tree branch.
Thank god you didn't take

1075
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:26,461
your eye out.

1076
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,215
[laughs] Poor boy!
I feel terrible for you.

1077
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:31,508
What could I say?

1078
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,306
I'm a city guy
not a country boy.

1079
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:38,849
[groans in pain]

1080
00:51:39,558 --> 00:51:41,685
I learnt my lesson. Don't worry.

1081
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:43,770
Never happen again

1082
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:50,652
[all laughing]

1083
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,738
[Lenny] Unbelievable. It was
the first time

1084
00:51:52,738 --> 00:51:55,449
he ever really shocked me,
but it wasn't the last.

1085
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,326
[music playing in the car]

1086
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,037
-Why didn't he wretch you out?
-I don't know.

1087
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,289
-He didn't even tell Phil?
-He didn't tell anybody.

1088
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,042
Maybe, he's not such
a bad guy after all.

1089
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:07,419
Yeah and maybe if your mother
screws howdy doody

1090
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,462
she won't get splinters.

1091
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:11,548
Hey, watch what you say
about my mother.

1092
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:13,675
Sorry.

1093
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,178
Dirty comics is about the only
sex you're going to see

1094
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:18,764
this summer.
-I already got a plan.

1095
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,391
-You want in on it?
-Are you crazy?

1096
00:52:21,683 --> 00:52:22,976
I don't even want to know
what it is.

1097
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:26,855
What is it?

1098
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,233
A move in to the inside.

1099
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,320
Inside! Inside the house?
You'll never get away with it.

1100
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:35,322
-Yes I will.
-You'll get caught.

1101
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,074
No, I won't.

1102
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,160
I'm going away.

1103
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:42,162
-What?

1104
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:43,997
I'm going to visit my mother
in Rhode Island.

1105
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,876
Before I go, would you like
to get into my pants?

1106
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:50,504
What?

1107
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,841
I said, while I'm away would you
water my plants.

1108
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,469
Uh... yeah sure.

1109
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,473
-For how long?
-Two weeks.

1110
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,858
[Lenny] After she left,
something weird happened.

1111
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,318
I couldn't wait for her
to get back.

1112
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,573
Not because I wanted to see her
having sex,

1113
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,200

What's a girl got to do to get
a little service around here?

How was your vacation?

1135

Oh, Paris is a vacation.
Rhode Island is just

1136
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:52,603
out of town.

1137
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,521
You look amazing.

1138
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,565

amazing before?

00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,527
-You look amazing as usual.
-Uh.

-What do you need?
-What I need is a vacation,

1141
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:06,658
but um, for now, let me see,
let me get a,

1142
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,411
-a pound of chopped meat.
-Okay.

1143
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:12,372
A half a pound of plum tomatoes
and um...

1144
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:15,167
let me get a large bottle
of that olive oil.

1145
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,418
[Phil] Right. What do you make,
a sauce?

1146
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:17,711
[Hedy] No, meatloaf.

1147
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:19,129
-[Phil] You make meatloaf?
-[Hedy] Ya.

1148
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:20,714
I make a good meatloaf, Phil.

1149
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:22,299
[Phil] What you're going
to serve it with?

1150
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:23,509
[Hedy] I don't know.

1151

-Lenny! Lenny!
-[Lenny] I'm on the crapper.

1152

What's up?

1162
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:55,624
Oh, nothing. Um... I just
wanted to let you know

1163
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,751
that your plants,
they're all fine.

1164
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,962
Oh! I was going to pay
you as soon as I--

1165
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:03,090
-No, it's not that.
-No, here, take this.

1166
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:05,384
Thank you very much.

Hey, you're welcome.

1168
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:09,847
So, uh, how's Dr. Flynn?

1169
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,225
I don't know. I haven't seen him
in two weeks remember?

1170
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,686
I'll tell him you were asking
for him when I see him tonight.

1171
00:57:17,688 --> 00:57:19,273
-Bye.
-Bye.

1172
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,070
Tonight? She's meeting
him tonight!

1173
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,822
I better be as horny as hell.

1174
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:28,699
He'll be horny as hell?

1175
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:34,413
[Lenny] Hmm, aunt Norma,
you make the best meat loaf.

1176
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:35,956
-I'm stuffed.
-Thank you.

1177
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,749
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us?

1178
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,668
Hey, it's Marilyn Monroe,
Seven Year Itch.

1179
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,336
He knows. He's the one
who told me about it.

1180
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:43,922
Ah, that's okay. I'm going over
to John's house.

1181
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,133
We're going to build
a model layer plane.

1182
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:49,595
-Alright sweety, see you later.
-[Lenny] Bye.

1183
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:51,263
Bye.

1184
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,689
[Lenny] I had come so far
since that night I tried

1185
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:01,940
to sneak a peek
through the keyhole

1186
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,860
of my mother's bedroom.
I was now a professional,

1187
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:06,028
an artist.

1188
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:11,867
As day became night,
and I slid into the closet

1189
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,118
opposite Hedy's bedroom.

1190
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:15,329
I knew I had checked
every detail.

1191
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:18,290
A plan for every possibility,
except the one.

1192
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,959
Total catastrophe.

1193
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,299
-Why were you being like this?
-I'm not being like anything.

1194
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:30,177
[Flynn] I'm being me, me upset,
me confused.

1195
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:31,929
[bangs]
But all me.

1196
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:33,889
And now me is getting my stuff.

1197
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:36,391
-I didn't say no forever.
-This wasn't screwing.

1198
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:40,812
But you said for now twice.
I don't have forever Hedy.

1199
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,611
I don't know why I have to be
such an ass.

1200
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,573
If I'm not enough for you now,
then I never will be.

1201
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,825
I waited all night in a closet
for this?

1202
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:55,452
[Hedy] I don't know.

1203
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:56,995
I was the one getting screwed.

1204
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,830
[Flynn] Because I cannot wait
around for you to figure it out.

1205
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:00,499
No, god forbid.

1206
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,417
You know, you're right.
Just go.

1207
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,378
[Flynn] I don't accept
that Hedy, I do not.

1208
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:05,921
Don't you make me out
the bad guy here.

1209
00:59:06,421 --> 00:59:08,549
[Hedy] Oh, no, no, no,
you're a great guy.

1210
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,175
You're all just wonderful
great guys.

1211
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,010
Now, will you just get the hell
out of my house.

1212
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,512
Just take your crap and go.

1213
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,104
I'll see you
on the ward sometime... nurse.

01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,018
How did you deliver the baby
in a car last night?

1575
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:49,730
Was a close one Lenny,
if it wasn't for you.

1576
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:51,607
I didn't even wanna think
about what would've

1577
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:52,900
happened to Norma or the baby.

1578
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,029
I owe ya, big time.

1579
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,281
Someday I'm gonna pay you back.

1580
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,534
Yeah, it's okay.

1581
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,328
[sighs]

1582
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,246
Let me tell you something
about Italians,

1583
01:19:07,164 --> 01:19:08,498
when they say they're
gonna pay you back,

1584
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:09,499
they're not asking you.

1585
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,586
One day I don't care
where, I don't care when.

1586
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,713
You come to me, you say,
'' Philly I'm collecting. ''

1587
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:16,840
I don't care what it takes.

1588
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:18,425
You got it, I swear.

1589
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:20,928
My mother's grave.

1590
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:26,975
[sighs]

1591
01:19:27,768 --> 01:19:29,228
Now that I got
that off my chest,

1592
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:32,689
I wanna talk to you about
the other party last night.

1593
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,775
Whatcha saw at Hetty's house.

1594
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:36,693
Yeah, I don't have
anything to say.

1595
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:38,278
Yeah but I do.

1596
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:42,407
I made some notes 'cause
I wanna get it right.

1597
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:43,617
[sighs]

1598
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:56,588
Lenny, it's not
easy for some guys

1599
01:19:56,588 --> 01:19:57,881
to keep their dick
in their pants.

1600
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,886
That isn't the first
thing I wanted to say

1601
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,555
but it is the most important.

1602
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:07,891
Okay, okay, whoa,
whoa, whoa kiddo.

1603
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,477
Look, I'm sorry.

1604
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:13,522
I mean... I almost wish
Norma would've caught me

1605
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:14,606
instead of you.

1606
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:16,275
All right that's
stupid, look at me,

1607
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:17,734
yeah how stupid is that, right?

1608
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:20,904
I just wish that you were older.

1609
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,490
That way you could understand
what happened last night.

1610
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:24,825
Oh, I understand.

1611
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:26,535
I thought you loved aunt Norma?

1612
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,162
I love your aunt Norma.

1613
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,959
But last night, I-- I just,
I just had this urge.

1614
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,836
Okay guys, they get urges.

1615
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:38,046
You can't, I mean they
can't, the kid...

1616
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:39,798
Christ!

1617
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:42,176
I'm glad I had a daughter
so Norma can do this

1618
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:43,635
when the time comes.

1619
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:48,974
Look Lenny, there's a difference
between love and sex.

1620
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,102
What happened last night
[smacks] was only sex.

1621
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,188
That's all it was,
it was perfectly normal.

1622
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,940
No, no I don't believe
that humping Hetty Callya

1623
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,817
while your wife
is having a baby is normal.

1624
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:00,360
So my timing is off all right,

1625
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,820
didn't anybody tell you
about the facts of life?

1626
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,239
Men are men, they have needs.

1627
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:06,450
-It's cheating!
-Everyone screws around.

1628
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:08,035
Even your own father.

1629
01:21:08,076 --> 01:21:09,578
Polinsky's not my father.

1630
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,211
My father?

1631
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:20,380
[whispers] Ah... shit.

1632
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,091
Pop?

1633
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:31,350
I'm sorry... I forgot you
don't know anything about this.

1634
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:33,227
What?

1635
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:34,853
What don't I know?

1636
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:37,564
Nothing, I'll tell you
when you're 20 or 30.

1637
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:40,359
He's my father, tell me!

1638
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:42,486
Look, there are somethings
you cannot tell.

1639
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:44,530
Your mother would hang
me from a lamp post.

1640
01:21:44,613 --> 01:21:46,865
Now listen, this subject
is closed, agabish!

1641
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:48,158
[birds chirping]

1642
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,829
Speaking of your mother, yo--

1643
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:55,249
Your hands are looking
like chopped meat,

1644
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:56,375
they need to be bandaged.

1645
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:58,669
She'll have a heart attack.

1646
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:02,297
I think Norma's got something
over here in the cabinet.

1647
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:07,678
Hey Phil?

1648
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,680
Yeah, what is it?

1649
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:12,099
I'm collecting.

1650
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,561
[sighs]
[bang]

1651
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:18,313
[whispers] Mother of God.

1652
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:20,607
No, Phil you swore. Tell me now!

1653
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,988
About five years ago
your father had an affair.

1654
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:29,199
What was her name?

1655
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:30,242
[sighs]

1656
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:33,745
Queen fucking Elizabeth
Lenny, I don't know her name.

1657
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:36,832
Meaning he had a woman
on the side, he knocked her up

1658
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:38,500
and he paid for the abortion.

1659
01:22:39,418 --> 01:22:40,419
You know what that is?

1660
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:46,175
Anyway he almost got away
with the whole thing

1661
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:47,176
but this woman...

1662
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:49,720
she got pissed off.

1663
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:52,347
She shot her mouth
off to your mother

1664
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:53,724
and that pretty much
put a dent in your...

1665
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:55,434
parent's marriage.

1666
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:59,688
She kicked him out
and he went to Arizona.

1667
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:02,983
Yeah.

1668
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:05,527
I remember that.

1669
01:23:06,945 --> 01:23:08,363
He said it was because
of his asthma.

1670
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:10,365
Yeah well it was because of...

1671
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:15,871
Anyway, the upshot is that
he talked his way back in.

1672
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:18,165
She never...

1673
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,127
slept in the same bed
with him again or anything.

1674
01:23:25,464 --> 01:23:27,966
Did she... still love him?

1675
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,930
I don't know kid, I--

1676
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:35,390
I doubt it.

1677
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:40,354
I mean she got married pretty
fast after he died, right?

1678
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:45,400
Now listen and don't go talking
to her about this today,

1679
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:46,652
don't bring it up, you hear me?

1680
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,154
I mean she's coming
in to see the baby.

1681
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:52,699
Yeah well uh...

1682
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:56,620
when she leaves, I...
I think I'm gonna go with her.

1683
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,540
Summer's almost over anyway.

1684
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:00,666
[birds chirping]

1685
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:05,295
I knew how sorry he was,
he hurt his family.

1686
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,422
And he knew that
I still loved him.

1687
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:08,715
No matter what.

1688
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:10,843
We just couldn't say it.

1689
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:12,928
At least not that day.

1690
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:14,930
[indistinct chatter]

1691
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:16,306
[engine revs]

1692
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:23,480
It's a girl, it's a girl!

1693
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,191
Hi mom.

1694
01:24:26,275 --> 01:24:28,193
My God Lenny,
what happened to your hands?

1695
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:29,820
I fell off a bike.

1696
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:31,321
Did you break anything?

1697
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,781
Just the bike.

1698
01:24:33,156 --> 01:24:34,157
I'm okay.

1699
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:36,118
It only looks worse than it is.

1700
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:38,328
Thank God you didn't
fall on your face.

1701
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,540
I hope you're taking better
care of your daughter

1702
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:43,041
than you are of my son?

1703
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,960
Oh, nice to see you
again, Sylvia.

1704
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:47,754
Phil, mazel tov .
Congratulations!

1705
01:24:47,796 --> 01:24:49,256
How are Norma and the baby?

1706
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:50,507
They're both fine,
she'd be good.

1707
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:52,926
I think Norma would want
to name her after our mother,

1708
01:24:52,926 --> 01:24:54,052
Sara Rebecca.

1709
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:56,430
Well actually, we picked a name.

1710
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:59,099
Philamina Theresa Dilorenzo.

1711
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,185
-Nice.
-Yeah.

1712
01:25:01,685 --> 01:25:02,728
And what if it was a boy?

1713
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:04,229
Jesus Christ
Almighty Dilorenzo?

1714
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:07,524
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-No.

1715
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,568
-Do you have any [indistinct]?
-Yeah.

1716
01:25:09,902 --> 01:25:12,070
How am I gonna explain in temple
I have a blood relative

1717
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,740
named sister...
Philamina Theresa Dilorenzo?

1718
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:15,949
[birds chirping]

1719
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,039
Congratulations.

1720
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,416
For what?

1721
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:28,462
You've uh--

1722
01:25:28,837 --> 01:25:29,838
mind if I sit?

1723
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,900
Babies. [hoots]

1724
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:51,235
[chuckles]

1725
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,197
Lenny uh...

1726
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:58,408
did anyone ever explain
to you about the...

1727
01:25:58,867 --> 01:25:59,868
birds and the bees?

1728
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,788
Yeah, we had in biology.

1729
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,165
Bees sting and birds
crap on ya head.

1730
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:06,291
[birds chirping]

1731
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:08,669
I know you don't like me

1732
01:26:09,545 --> 01:26:11,672
but uh... look I'm aware that...

1733
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:15,425
that boys your age
are very curious about things.

1734
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:19,304
Women... love.

1735
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:22,599
[whispers] Sex.

1736
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,563
[sighs] You know
look, I-- I'm sure

1737
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:29,606
that if your father
were here he would...

1738
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:31,733
he would be teaching
you all the things

1739
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:32,818
that a young man should know.

1740
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,863
Yeah? Before or after
he tell me about the time

1741
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:37,364
he went to Arizona
for his asthma?

1742
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:39,950
What are you saying?

1743
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:41,618
You know... Pa.

1744
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:43,996
When he went to Arizona
for his asthma?

1745
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:46,498
Only he didn't have
asthma, did he?

1746
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,170
Who told you this, Phil?

1747
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:53,005
Phil the talking mule?

1748
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:54,173
It's the truth, isn't it?

1749
01:26:54,423 --> 01:26:56,091
Lenny, your father
made a mistake, one.

1750
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:58,427
One mistake in his entire life.

1751
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,846
And he paid for
it until the day he died.

1752
01:27:01,138 --> 01:27:02,222
But she took him back.

1753
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:04,141
For you, not for her.

1754
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:05,767
God.

1755
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:08,896
Lenny, your father
was a good man.

1756
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:11,398
But he was human
like the rest of us.

1757
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:12,733
The rest of us?

1758
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:14,026
You too?

1759
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,611
Me? [laughs]

1760
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:19,781
No, no not me,
I'm all talk Lenny.

1761
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:22,534
Yeah I fly to the women
but I never touch,

1762
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:23,660
your mother knows that.

1763
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:26,371
And I would never do anything
to let her have any more pain.

1764
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:28,749
You sure don't mind
my pain too much.

1765
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:30,709
You kick me outta
my house for the summer.

1766
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,586
No... I didn't kick you out.

1767
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,921
I needed...

1768
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:37,966
the three of us needed...
time to adjust.

1769
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:43,388
Plus you were... so crazy
with all of your...

1770
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,057
your... [lips rolls]

1771
01:27:45,307 --> 01:27:46,308
interests.

1772
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,477
I don't know, I figured...

1773
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:50,687
I figured maybe you could
learn a few things by...

1774
01:27:50,979 --> 01:27:54,066
by spending time with a pregnant
woman and an Italian stud,

1775
01:27:54,107 --> 01:27:55,108
I-- I don't know.

1776
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,404
Yeah.

1777
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:01,365
Sorta like summer school.

1778
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:02,449
[birds chirping]

1779
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:06,578
It's a good call.

1780
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,247
I learned a lot.

1781
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:11,750
Ah... me too.

1782
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:14,461
I learned that...

1783
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:16,839
I don't wanna be your father.

1784
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:19,424
Oh yeah?

1785
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:21,343
Why not?

1786
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,138
Because your father
was Sid Levine.

1787
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:28,892
And I can't be Sid Levine
even If I wanted to be.

1788
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:32,312
No one could replace him.

1789
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:34,648
No one.

1790
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:37,359
I'm an honest preacher.

1791
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:40,529
I don't put my thumb
on the scale.

1792
01:28:41,655 --> 01:28:43,073
And I never lie to anyone.

1793
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:46,326
So I need you to trust
me when I tell you this,

1794
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:49,621
I love your mother

1795
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:51,957
and I will always
be there for her.

1796
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,543
And If you let me...

1797
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:56,753
I'll be there for you too.

1798
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:57,796
[slow music]

1799
01:28:59,756 --> 01:29:01,049
I'd like
to be your friend, Lenny?

1800
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:03,552
I'd like that a lot.

1801
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:05,095
[slow music continues]

1802
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:09,057
So uh...

1803
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:12,519
how does that sound to you?

1804
01:29:12,561 --> 01:29:14,062
[slow music continues]

1805
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:18,901
Yeah.

1806
01:29:20,152 --> 01:29:21,361
Sounds pretty good.

1807
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:22,863
[slow music continues]

1808
01:29:25,532 --> 01:29:26,533
Good.

1809
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:29,745
Good.

1810
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:32,497
Now can we please
talk about sex?

1811
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:33,790
[laughs]

1812
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,880
Yeah, sure what
do you wanna know? [both laugh]

1813
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:42,966
Listen, listen,
I bought you this.

1814
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:45,135
I bought you this book.

1815
01:29:45,511 --> 01:29:46,970
It was written by two doctors...

1816
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:50,933
and it has everything in there
that a-- a young man...

1817
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:53,769
should know about uh...
oh everything.

1818
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:55,187
[birds chirping]

1819
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,524
Uh, Lenny listen uh...

1820
01:29:59,525 --> 01:30:01,193
don't tell your mother
about all this, okay?

1821
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:02,945
[birds chirping continues]

1822
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:05,697
Thanks.

1823
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,992
A thing I can never understand
about Moore Polinsky...

1824
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:10,744
is why my father liked him?

1825
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:13,830
That day... I figured it out.

1826
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,458
Than I ran all the way
to Hetty's house.

1827
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,626
[boy] It was fall.

1828
01:30:17,626 --> 01:30:18,961
[Lenny] Well he was on his
way home but...

1829
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:20,879
uh he got a flat tire.

1830
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,173
And by the time Hetty
and I got to her house

1831
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,341
Phil showed up.

1832
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:26,718
And Hetty actually delivered
the baby in the car?

1833
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,345
-Yes.
-You think your bike is a mess?

1834
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,471
Eww!

1835
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,932
Well... I guess now
that the baby's born

1836
01:30:32,057 --> 01:30:34,101
old Phil can start
getting laid again.

1837
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,020
Yeah too bad he can't stay
around another couple of days.

1838
01:30:37,396 --> 01:30:38,397
Try to watch.

1839
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:42,025
Actually they won't
be able to have intercourse

1840
01:30:42,025 --> 01:30:43,277
for the next six weeks.

1841
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:45,487
Why not?

1842
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:47,239
Well her cervix
is still dilated.

1843
01:30:47,906 --> 01:30:49,950
And there is a high risk
of uterine infection.

1844
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:52,327
Although intercourse
is prohibited,

1845
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:55,122
there are still other forms
of sexual activity to engage in.

1846
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,749
Philititis, Congolious and uh...

1847
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,084
even anal intercourse.

1848
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:01,253
Although I find that
personally distasteful.

1849
01:31:02,254 --> 01:31:03,839
Probably the best way
for them to deal

1850
01:31:03,881 --> 01:31:05,299
with the sexual
deprivation is...

1851
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:07,759
uh... you know,
general foreplay.

1852
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:09,511
And uh... If Norma's up to it,

1853
01:31:09,553 --> 01:31:11,471
manual stimulation
of a potters organ.

1854
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:12,514
[birds chirping]

1855
01:31:15,142 --> 01:31:16,143
A hand job.

1856
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:18,020
Oh.

1857
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:19,730
Lenny, where did you
learn all of this?

1858
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:21,940
Ah... I just picked it up.

1859
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:24,151
Did you know
the reason a man walks

1860
01:31:24,151 --> 01:31:25,611
next to the curb
when he's with a woman?

1861
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:27,154
It's because back
in the old days

1862
01:31:27,154 --> 01:31:28,447
the horse carriages
used to come by

1863
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:29,489
and splash mud on to the women's

1864
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:30,699
large hoop skirts.

1865
01:31:30,741 --> 01:31:31,742
[slow music]

1866
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:33,869
Go back to the part about
manual stimulation.

1867
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:38,332
I had read that book
from cover to cover.

1868
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:40,584
I was a walking
sex encyclopedia.

1869
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:42,753
I completely dazzled.

1870
01:31:44,254 --> 01:31:45,756
It was a perfect
time to say goodbye.

1871
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:49,176
Well it's it guys, I gotta go.

1872
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:50,761
[slow music continues]

1873
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:56,058
When am I gonna see you again?

1874
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:58,185
I'll be back to visit the baby.

1875
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,230
And uh... Norma invited me
for thanksgiving dinner.

1876
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:02,731
[slow music continues]

1877
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:10,405
It's not uncommon for some girls
to start their menstrual cycle

1878
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:11,532
late into their teens.

1879
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:13,951
It's perfectly normal.

1880
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:15,077
You'll be fine.

1881
01:32:15,953 --> 01:32:16,954
Thanks.

1882
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:20,874
So where's uh...

1883
01:32:20,999 --> 01:32:22,459
[slow music continues]

1884
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:39,810
It's been great having
you around this summer.

1885
01:32:40,185 --> 01:32:42,312
Lenny, I'm gonna miss you.

1886
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:45,983
I'll miss you too.

1887
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:49,528
Maybe when you come back,
I can see you around sometime?

1888
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:52,614
I mean... without
Robert and Joce.

1889
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:54,491
I'd like that...

1890
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:55,617
a lot.

1891
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:57,119
[slow music continues]

1892
01:33:00,372 --> 01:33:01,373
And then...

1893
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:02,875
she took off her glasses.

1894
01:33:17,347 --> 01:33:19,474
There was something
in that book that I'd just read

1895
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:21,935
that says sometimes women
can initiate stuff.

1896
01:33:23,437 --> 01:33:25,689
I'm pretty sure Alice
was initiating it.

1897
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,232
[slow music continues]

1898
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:40,829
Until then... I only kissed
people 'cause I had to.

1899
01:33:41,246 --> 01:33:42,581
Like my grandmother.

1900
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:45,167
This was the first time
I ever really kissed someone

1901
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:46,251
because I wanted to.

1902
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:48,670
And it felt... really good.

1903
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:52,007
I told Alice that of all
the things we did this summer,

1904
01:33:52,466 --> 01:33:54,009
this is what I remember
the most about it.

1905
01:33:54,593 --> 01:33:55,719
And then I realized
I had to tell

1906
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:56,929
someone else the same thing.

1907
01:33:57,262 --> 01:33:58,347
[birds chirping]

1908
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:04,311
I knew I should be thinking...
that I could never forgive her

1909
01:34:05,145 --> 01:34:06,939
but the most important
thing about Hetty Callya

1910
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,398
wasn't what I'd
seen last night.

1911
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:10,943
I just wasn't really
sure how to tell her.

1912
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:12,194
[slow music]

1913
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:15,239
Hey you're leaving, huh?

1914
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,991
Yeah.

1915
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:24,373
I guess the house
is gonna be pretty crowded

1916
01:34:24,373 --> 01:34:25,457
with a new baby and all.

1917
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:28,710
Yeah I guess. [chuckles]

1918
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:33,257
[Hetty] Lenny...

1919
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:38,220
I'm so sorry about last night.

1920
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:39,346
[birds chirping]

1921
01:34:41,056 --> 01:34:42,474
[slow music]

1922
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,896
Hetty... I'll always like you.

1923
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,023
Always.

[slow music continues]

1925
01:34:53,068 --> 01:34:54,069
I mean hey...

1926
01:34:54,778 --> 01:34:56,446
I don't have any other
friends whose uh...

1927
01:34:56,655 --> 01:34:57,739
fathers are poets.

1928
01:34:57,823 --> 01:34:59,283

01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:11,712
You promise you'll
come back next summer?

1931
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:13,338
Yeah will you uh...

1932
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:15,549
promise me you'll
add less water and more beer?

[chuckles]

1934
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:23,515
Listen... I wanted
to give you something

1935
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:26,268
before you left but...

1936
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,770
now I kinda feel
like money would be an insult.

1937
01:35:31,773 --> 01:35:33,150
Is there anything you want?

1938
01:35:34,276 --> 01:35:36,486

glove or something?

[birds chirping]

01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:48,498
-So what's for dinner?
-Anything you want darling.

1941
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:52,419
I don't know maybe uh...
a nice tossed green salad,

1942
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:54,254
um... mashed potatoes and uh...

1943
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:57,090
maybe a nice,
juicy sirloin steak.

1944
01:35:58,592 --> 01:36:01,053
I know a butcher who can cut
a beautiful piece of sirloin.

1945
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:02,596
Yeah? Great.

1946
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:04,890
Just uh...
don't cut from the ends.

[engine starts]

1948
01:36:07,226 --> 01:36:08,936
Most of my friends
believe that Santa Claus

1949
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:10,229
gave me those
Christmas cookies.

1950
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:12,773
But I was pretty sure they'd
believe me when I told them

1951
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:14,149
I talked with girls about sex.

Write a porno comic book,
made friends with my stepfather,

hit the trifecta and wiped
a potato a country mile.

1954
01:36:21,323 --> 01:36:22,908
But I know kids
from the Bronx...

1955
01:36:23,492 --> 01:36:25,285
and when you tell them
you spent the night

1956
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,663

with a beautiful woman

1957
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,707
