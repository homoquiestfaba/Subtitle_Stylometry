for overstocked toys,

00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,275
Well, you were friends
with the night watcher,

454
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,644
you must know where
the exits are.

It wouldn't matter.

456
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,581
This place is chained
tight until the morning.

457
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,616
The only way out is
through the loading doors,

458

they're open in the office.

He shot the locks of one

460

can go out that exit.

The one on the north end?

462
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,192
They blocked that off
after you came through.

That's when I first saw them.

464

Can you get the loading

supposed to get there?

Yeah but I'm not too
crazy about this idea.

What the hell was he
talking about back there anyway?

There's demonic power
here, I can feel it.

526
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,833
It must be some sort of
satanic ritual or something.

527

conjure something up.

It's part of the astral play.

So I found a way to hell.

925
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:45,088
So I became a toy soldier.

926
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:45,922
What's your name?

927
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:52,428
You haven't given me one yet.

928
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,663
I have to go now mom.

929
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:57,133
But I'll see you soon.

930
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,467
Bye mom.

931
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:07,476

932
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,420
It's over, isn't it?

934
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,976
Who were you talking to?

935
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:47,450
My little boy.

937
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:05,468
My little boy.
