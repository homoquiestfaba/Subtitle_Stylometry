00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:33,300
Ethan,

3
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:38,734
How do you know
that what you're saying is true?

4
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:48,017
You're asking me to
tell you what is real and what isn't?

5
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:52,054
I know what happened.

6
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:55,618
I know what my father did!

7
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,818
And I know what
you're trying to do!

8
00:00:57,843 --> 00:01:00,656
Ethan, your disease has
altered your memory.

9
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,781
Unknowingly to you, of course.

10
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:05,822
But it's...it's there in
place to keep you happy.

11
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:07,337
That's bullshit!

12
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,606
You're using what condition
I had against me so no one will find out.

13
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:14,156
That is not true! We are here...Ethan...

14
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,976
Is my father in there?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,271
Ethan, sit down.

16
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:21,322
-Dad?
-We have a situation.

17
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,619
Are you in there?

18
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:26,513
Huh?
Can you see me?

19
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,825
Can you see your son?

20
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,341
You promised me!

21
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,095
You promised!

22
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,711
Give me my life back!

23
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,460
Ethan?

24
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:51,678
Ethan...

25
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,623
OK...Ethan, Ethan!

26
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,079
Come on, say something.

27
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,171
Come on...

28
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:01,969
Who are you?

29
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,624
Let me help you up.

30
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,565
Let me help you up.

31
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:12,625
Easy. You can do it.

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,785
Easy...easy...careful, careful. Here.

33
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:16,718
He's experiencing temporary
memory loss.

34
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,894
He'll be OK.

35
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,328
You know, I've been
meaning to ask you something.

36
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,955
Was this ever about him?

37
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:30,117
Or was it always just about you?

38
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,728
Charles...

39
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,633
He's your son.

40
00:03:38,657 --> 00:03:40,123
I'm well aware of that, Nick.

41
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,428
You did this to him, Charles.

42
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:45,801
This is serious,OK? This isn't a cold.
-He's going to be OK.

43
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,061
No, that's just storage.

44
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,234
Uh...your room's upstairs.

45
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,563
I'll show you.

46
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:58,688
These are all my things.

47
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:01,008
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

48
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,015
What else do you remember?

49
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:08,896
I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

50
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,783
Doing what?

51
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,577
Telling you how I feel.

52
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,257
Why?

53
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:21,736
Honestly, I still feel
uncomfortable calling you 'Dad'.

54
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:31,661
You're gonna be OK.

55
00:05:32,842 --> 00:05:34,654
I think we're all gonna be OK.

56
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,145
We all just want you
to be happy and...

57
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,065
Please...
Hey, I just...you're here now...

58
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:43,805
This is your home.

59
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,003
I know it can't be
easy starting your life over.

60
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,572
New home, new wife, new kids.
You seem to be doing just fine

61
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:07,484
I need you to take
 those twice a day.

62
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,330
You just got out of the hospital.

63
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,196
Doesn't come without
side effects.

64
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,063
What if I forget?

65
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:17,596
Don't.

66
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,172
Hey...Don't cry.

67
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,505
I remember everything.

68
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,799
But...I just can't feel it.

69
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,824
I know that doesn't make any sense.
But...

70
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,308
I mean, my head hurts sometimes
when I think about that stuff.

71
00:08:29,345 --> 00:08:30,933
She smiles when she's
with you.

72
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,565
My sister.

73
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,757
She used to be that
way all the time.

74
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:44,762
You scared?

75
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:47,809
No.

76
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:52,675
You know I had
almost forgotten about it?

77
00:08:55,062 --> 00:08:55,967
Sorry.

78
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,735
Call me when you get there.
-Mom, please.

79
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:32,726
You know you're my
best friend, right?

80
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,890
-I gotta go.
-OK.

81
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,352
I can't believe we're
not going to see him for seven months.

82
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,467
Why did you
go to the airport?

83
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,454
Why?

84
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,756
I was just curious. Jesus.

85
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:29,696
That picture.

86
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,705
I don't know who it is.

87
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,819
You?

88
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:41,274
No.

89
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,188
By the way,

90
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,871
mom wanted you to
have dinner with her tomorrow night.

91
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,350
Are you? 
-I live there.

92
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,495
It's your turn to
deal with her shit.

93
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,609
Hey Ally.

94
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,189
Who's in the picture?

95
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:12,524
Why do you have
to do that?

96
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,533
What?

97
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,706
I hate it when you do this.

98
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,418
This is not exactly been easy.

99
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:25,184
Will you quit trying
to blame me?

100
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:26,484
Or Ally?

101
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,779
I don't.

102
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:31,105
I don't. 
I blame your father.

103
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,226
Oh, Jesus...

104
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:36,589
Can we have one dinner without
you digging his grave, too?

105
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:39,941
He did that himself.
You have no idea what it is like to

106
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,014
love someone for twenty years

107
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:46,317
And then watch them turn
and marry the next best thing.

108
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:51,977
It was his responsibility to help us
through everything and...

109
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:55,241
...and he let this family fall apart.

110
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:59,399
Let me tell you something, Ethan.

111
00:12:00,144 --> 00:12:01,332
Look at me!

112
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,995
Love makes you blind.

113
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:06,921
Excuse me, miss.

114
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:09,179
Uh, you dropped this.

115
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,239
What are you doing?

116
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,546
I thought you were asleep.

117
00:16:22,571 --> 00:16:23,059
Oh,

118
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,856
what do you possibly think you're
going to find here, Ethan, huh?

119
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,717
What happened to me?

120
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,123
We saved your life, Ethan.

121
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:35,715
I know you keep saying that, but
I really think I'm OK.

122
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,075
I just need to know.

123
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,038
Well, there are some
things I can't tell you.

124
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:46,694
Understanding it is with a
doctor-patient relationship.

125
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,761
What about a father-son relationship?

126
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,782
I can't.

127
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:59,192
I'm sorry.

128
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,774
Don't come here ever again.

129
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,138
Are you sure it was her?

130
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:49,892
Yeah.

131
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,908
Well, what'd she say?

132
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,003
Didn't ask.

133
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:57,327
Why not?

134
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:01,166
Ally, I followed her.

135
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:04,316
-I never done that before.
-How do you know?

136
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:06,543
My memory's fine.

137
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,125
It's-it's not like I
don't remember stuff.

138
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:12,362
Like when I gave you that.

139
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,363
If you know something,

140
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,855
I wish you'd tell me.

141
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:27,116
I wish you didn't
believe I had something to hide.

142
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:33,916
OK.

143
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,596
Have you talked to Luke?

144
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,019
No.

145
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:43,518
I miss him.

146
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,790
I think I'm gonna go.

147
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,029
Ethan...

148
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:53,417
Our family...

149
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,702
You're the only one
who still wants it.

150
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:02,155
Let's not let that 
get between us.

151
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:15,070
Shut up.

152
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,103
Seriously? Are you really
going to bring me here? Seriously?

153
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,714
Hi.

154
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,134
You're Camille, right?

155
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,334
What is it with you?

156
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:51,733
What do you mean?

157
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,943
You're stalking me.

158
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,387
I think you're giving yourself
too much credit.

159
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:04,991
No, I'm not.

160
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,013
OK.

161
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:17,621
Forget it.

162
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,813
Sit down, Ethan.

163
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:23,985
I was just kidding.

164
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,005
How'd you know my name?

165
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:32,006
Everyone knows your name.

166
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,780
Hey, Ethan. What a
pleasant surprise.

167
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:49,023
Hey, Miss Linda. 
You got a minute?

168
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,942
Do you know Camille?

169
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,041
I don't know. 
Maybe.

170
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:56,681
Do you remember this?

171
00:21:57,757 --> 00:21:58,810
Look.

172
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:15,561
Who's that?

173
00:22:16,637 --> 00:22:17,986
I don't remember that.

174
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:21,153
Ethan...

175
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,726
That...is your brother.

176
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,507
Adam.

177
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:35,686
My brother?

178
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:41,555
I don't remember that,
I don't have any memory.

179
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:44,053
Memory of that.

180
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,994
Do you have anything else
about that?

181
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:50,627
Ethan...

182
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,821
I'm sure it will come back to you. 
Just give it some time.

183
00:22:58,195 --> 00:23:00,068
I've been told that before.

184
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,148
Ethan.

185
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:06,544
Where is he?

186
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,716
Adam Galloway. 
I'm here to see him.

187
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:19,159
I'm sorry, Ethan, you're not
 authorized to go up there.

188
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:21,349
You know my name!

189
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,039
Everyone here knows your name.

190
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,688
You're Charles' son. 
Would you  like me to call him for you?

191
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:27,737
Ethan, you can't go!

192
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:28,764
Ethan!

193
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,224
I know I have a brother!

194
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:36,128
Why didn't you tell me?
Where is he?

195
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:38,466
Ethan, Ethan...whoa.
Calm down, take a breath.

196
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:41,246
Take a breath.
Take a breath. OK.

197
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,106
Listen, listen...listen to me,

198
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,371
your brother...

199
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,119
Hey, your brother
Adam died.

200
00:23:50,716 --> 00:23:52,456
Your brother's dead, Ethan.

201
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,176
Yeah. He killed himself
a little over a year ago.

202
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,061
Let's go. 
It's going to be OK.

203
00:23:57,494 --> 00:23:59,215
It's going to be OK. 
Yes.

204
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,905
It's going to be OK. Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

205
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,058
Ethan.

206
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:14,361
Ethan, you're alright.

207
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:17,138
Hey! Hey.

208
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,904
You're alright. 
You're alright.

209
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:27,602
Say something.

210
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:30,889
Say something.

211
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:32,296
Come on.

212
00:24:32,709 --> 00:24:34,494
Why did she tell me that?

213
00:24:35,094 --> 00:24:36,921
Who told you what? 
Who?

214
00:24:38,631 --> 00:24:40,199
Lucas' mom.

215
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:44,452
Why did she tell me?
-No, no. No. Ethan. You heard wrong.

216
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:46,813
You heard wrong.

217
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:50,594
No, you're alright.

218
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:53,898
Let's get you home.

219
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,671
I'm going to get you home, Ok?

220
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,151
Ok.

221
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:03,845
Come on, I got you.

222
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:06,752
I'm going to get you home.

223
00:25:07,544 --> 00:25:08,919
You're gonna be alright.

224
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:10,265
You're alright.

225
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,151
What are those?

226
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:31,918
What are you doing here?

227
00:25:33,496 --> 00:25:35,157
Your step-mom let me in.

228
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,397
-She did?
-Uh-hum

229
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,594
Excuse me.
Oh.

230
00:25:41,364 --> 00:25:43,160
Sorry. 
Please.

231
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:59,116
It's a little cleaner 
than I remembered.

232
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:01,380
You've never been in
my room before.

233
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:03,307
Have you?

234
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:08,320
Uh...It's a little cleaner
than I would have thought.

235
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:12,940
What are you doing here?

236
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:18,252
Ok...

237
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,966
I...came to say I'm sorry.

238
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:24,253
About yesterday.

239
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:27,488
I'm...

240
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,314
I'm sorry.

241
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:34,753
Ok.

242
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:41,694
So, you paint?

243
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:43,854
No.

244
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:46,995
Who did these?

245
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,497
You ask a lot of questions.

246
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,409
They're really beautiful, Ethan.

247
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,693
I mess around sometimes.

248
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:58,880
How come they don't have faces?

249
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:01,546
I can't do faces.

250
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,756
Have you ever read 
the poem Bellustar?

251
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:10,485
I'm at the adapted play
tomorrow night.

252
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:12,299
You should come.

253
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,020
I believe you know where it is.

254
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,147
Right.

255
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:20,663
You know, you're supposed
to stand eight feet away.

256
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,820
Hmm.

257
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,284
So, there's a goddess in the poem

258
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:26,904
also faceless. 
Laughing.

259
00:27:27,738 --> 00:27:30,371
My first poem 
you can't even see my face.

260
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:32,170
Anyway.

261
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:36,919
It's supposed to represent
the unknowable future.

262
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,857
And it's six feet.

263
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:41,484
Not eight.

264
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:43,897
No, it's...it's eight.

265
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:56,829
It's six.

266
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,943
No, it's eight.

267
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,557
You should come.

268
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,135
Say something.

269
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:39,264
Say something!

270
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:53,307
Mom.

271
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,374
What?

272
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:58,001
Mom, you need help.

273
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,314
No, I'm Ok.

274
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,347
Mom, please.

275
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:05,581
Ethan, give me some time.

276
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:08,982
I'll be alright. 
I promise.

277
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:10,269
Don't promise.

278
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,187
If you don't mean it, 
don't promise.

279
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,437
What makes you think
I'm not going to keep it?

280
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:32,834
Do you have any pictures of Adam?

281
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,266
What for?

282
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,180
Yes or no, please.

283
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,533
No, I don't.

284
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:41,421
Mom, don't lie to me.

285
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:43,236
I don't have any!

286
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,008
You need to help mom.

287
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,014
Why?

288
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:57,894
She hates me.

289
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:01,801
-'Cause she needs help.
-Don't we all?

290
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:05,762
Dad.

291
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:07,442
This is serious.

292
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:10,570
I am serious.

293
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,209
All she wants from me is money.

294
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,744
So don't stand there and tell me
about how much she needs help

295
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,230
It's a waste of time.

296
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,325
You were married to
her for twenty years.

297
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,490
And now we're divorced.

298
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:23,347
And it's about to
happen again.

299
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,052
Unbelievable.

300
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,411
Look around.

301
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:38,030
Like this little paradise
world you live in now?

302
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:41,184
Don't get too attached to it.

303
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:43,904
It will all be gone very soon.

304
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,303
What the hell does that even mean?

305
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,555
What does that mean?

306
00:30:53,661 --> 00:30:54,592
Well,

307
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:57,799
it means that my good friend,

308
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,211
my former employee, rather,

309
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,917
Milo Sofley,

310
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,697
has filed a lawsuit against us.

311
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:06,598
Yeah...

312
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,732
I think you met him when
you left the hospital.

313
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,184
Dad?

314
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,650
What?

315
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Can I live with
you from now on?

316
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:34,216
What's wrong with your mother?

317
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,522
Will you help her or not?

318
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,621
Can I take that thing
out of your lip?

319
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,074
I'll get my things tomorrow.

320
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,514
What's in this room?

321
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,915
I have no idea.

322
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:17,548
Yes, you do.

323
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:21,636
Ethan, what's wrong with you?

324
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:26,248
Do you keep secrets, Ally?

325
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,587
We all keep our secrets, Ethan.

326
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:36,603
Yeah.

327
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:39,634
Ethan?

328
00:32:39,882 --> 00:32:41,174
What's wrong?

329
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,813
Why was I in the hospital?

330
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:48,419
-You were sick.
-I'm serious.

331
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,969
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

332
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:52,329
I promise.

333
00:32:52,562 --> 00:32:53,688
I would tell you.

334
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,080
I think the answer's in there.

335
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:05,116
It's a storage room, Ethan.

336
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,149
There are secrets.

337
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:12,081
There are secrets in there.

338
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,237
Have you been taking
your medicine?

339
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:26,854
No.

340
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:31,105
I think you should.

341
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,356
Dad said he'd help her.

342
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:50,707
That's good.

343
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:49,381
Are you OK?

344
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,331
Is this a dream?

345
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:57,854
No.

346
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,187
It's something else.

347
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,348
You gotta feel in dreams.

348
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:05,941
You can only imagine.

349
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,025
Can you feel me?

350
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:27,466
This is not you.

351
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:33,025
This is you.

352
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,009
I can feel you.

353
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:48,531
Hold on.

354
00:36:26,387 --> 00:36:28,671
I'm glad you made it.
-Thank you.

355
00:36:28,696 --> 00:36:30,404
-Yeah. 
No problem.

356
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,796
What did you think?

357
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,133
It was interesting.

358
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,760
Yes, it is.

359
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:41,037
And what are you doing now?

360
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,949
I don't know. I hadn't
really thought about it. Why?

361
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:46,552
Are you sure you want to know?

362
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,579
Ok, I'll tell you.

363
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,645
We're having a party.

364
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,738
I took the key from
 the hotel I work at.

365
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:56,227
Isn't that illegal?

366
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:58,587
No it's fine, they won't
even know we're there.

367
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,669
Ethan, 
come on, we're leaving.

368
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:02,713
You should go.

369
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,358
Come on.

370
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:07,565
It'll be fun.

371
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:22,365
Hey, everybody.

372
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,358
Ethan?

373
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,698
Are you Ok?

374
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,198
Yeah,
I'm fine.

375
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,312
I've discovered something
about you, Ethan.

376
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,040
You are a compulsive liar.

377
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:18,771
You should smile more often.

378
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,298
What?

379
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:24,631
What's so funny?

380
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,510
You're not the first
person who's told me that.

381
00:38:31,295 --> 00:38:33,897
Well, if I may plead
my case, Mr. Ethan.

382
00:38:36,467 --> 00:38:37,300
A life...

383
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:38,773
is not worth living if...

384
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,641
you don't...

385
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,075
have something to smile about.

386
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,508
Well, you might not be
yourself, then.

387
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:53,314
Well, actually, I am a
figment of your imagination.

388
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:54,608
Really?

389
00:38:55,496 --> 00:38:56,949
That's interesting.

390
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,914
I would think if I...

391
00:38:59,939 --> 00:39:01,247
made up, then,

392
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:02,642
you'd be taller.

393
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:05,002
with a short skirt.

394
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:19,082
It's a shame I'm real.

395
00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:23,910
No, it's not.

396
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:55,805
Hey. What's up?

397
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:16,699
Wake up!

398
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:20,251
Wake up!

399
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,281
Wake up!

400
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:41,943
Where are all the
boxes that were in that room?

401
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:43,830
I moved them.

402
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:44,796
Where?

403
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:50,477
There's something wrong
with me.

404
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,283
Why do you think that is?

405
00:42:57,994 --> 00:42:59,534
You stopped taking your pills.

406
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:04,371
Look at me.

407
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:05,417
What?

408
00:43:07,226 --> 00:43:08,566
These are important.

409
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:09,668
I forgot!

410
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
You can forget a
lot of things, Ethan.

411
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:14,176
but don't forget these.

412
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,388
Since when do
you really care?

413
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:18,222
Ethan, stop, you're
still my son. I'm still-

414
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:20,247
This is not about
these fucking pills!

415
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,916
You know something!

416
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,415
And you've gone to
extensive links to make

417
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,228
sure that I don't
find out about it.

418
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:28,967
I can't take it anymore!

419
00:43:29,384 --> 00:43:32,698
You told everyone I know
never to speak about Adam?

420
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,711
I...I know this has
something to do with

421
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:36,782
the fact that I was
in the hospital.

422
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:39,704
And you're the only
one who can tell me about that.

423
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,213
Aren't you?

424
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,218
They day your brother...

425
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:51,121
...killed himself,

426
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,245
something happened
to you, as well.

427
00:43:57,095 --> 00:43:58,338
Something?

428
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,210
You're a fucking neurosurgeon,

429
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:03,483
something doesn't cut it.

430
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:07,241
If you want me to tell you, I
would suggest you lower your voice.

431
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,594
Sit down.

432
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,450
When you saw him,

433
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,856
when you Saw Adam,

434
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,153
an artery ruptured in your brain.

435
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:37,364
And the lack of oxygen damaged

436
00:44:37,389 --> 00:44:40,812
some areas that are necessary
for you to properly recall your memories.

437
00:44:44,237 --> 00:44:46,324
You blocked out your
brother and everything

438
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,237
having to do with him.

439
00:44:51,678 --> 00:44:53,678
So in essence you forgot.

440
00:44:57,603 --> 00:45:00,490
I need you to know
that I was trying to help you, Ethan.

441
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,648
I thought it was best if
those things stayed forgotten.

442
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:06,749
and I tried to keep
it that way.

443
00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:12,872
Ethan.

444
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:18,982
You blamed yourself
for what happened.

445
00:45:27,276 --> 00:45:29,276
Do you know 
what predetermination is?

446
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:33,551
Like fate?

447
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:36,523
No.

448
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:38,666
What do you mean?

449
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:42,264
There's a difference.

450
00:45:44,245 --> 00:45:45,852
If you believe in fate, then

451
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,899
all the choices you make
both right and wrong,

452
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:50,510
are not yours.

453
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:54,638
You think that they are, but...

454
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:57,634
they happen that way
because they have to.

455
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:01,646
Love?

456
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:04,606
What do you believe?

457
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:09,790
I'd like to believe I'm
in control of my own life.

458
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:14,616
Although lately it
doesn't feel that way.

459
00:46:18,932 --> 00:46:21,043
There are things in place.

460
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,014
But it's my decision...

461
00:46:27,382 --> 00:46:28,746
to be here.

462
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:34,229
That's predetermination.

463
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:50,826
Ethan...

464
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:52,358
look at me.

465
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,008
I don't...

466
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:56,910
know why you...

467
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:59,363
worry about these things
you can't control.

468
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,716
Like...

469
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:04,663
your past,

470
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,216
your family,

471
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:10,433
your friends.

472
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:17,240
Thank you.

473
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:23,181
I like it.

474
00:48:38,798 --> 00:48:40,798
I'm so sorry.

475
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:53,740
No.

476
00:49:04,603 --> 00:49:06,914
Ally, Ally, whoa
whoa. Come on. Come on.

477
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:08,474
Come on. Let's go back.

478
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:10,888
-Alisson!
-Just leave me alone!

479
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:18,139
Do you need help?

480
00:49:25,011 --> 00:49:26,265
Promise me

481
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:31,394
Ok.

482
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:36,103
I promise.

483
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,141
I promise, baby.

484
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,039
I'll see you in rehab.

485
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,069
Come on.

486
00:50:53,757 --> 00:50:55,253
I love you.

487
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:05,303
Come on.

488
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,327
Excuse me!

489
00:51:07,351 --> 00:51:10,514
Um, will you take
our picture?

490
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,254
Say I'm beautiful.

491
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:49,471
I love fireworks.

492
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:22,907
My body. It hurts.

493
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,931
What are you doing here?

494
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:39,567
Can you...take a
look at something for us?

495
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:49,547
I was hoping you might
be able to tell me where you got it.

496
00:53:05,861 --> 00:53:07,861
This isn't my room.

497
00:53:13,002 --> 00:53:14,778
They're not in the right place.

498
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:37,587
Hello, Ethan.

499
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:41,547
How'd you know my name?

500
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:43,982
Everyone knows your name.

501
00:55:45,336 --> 00:55:46,336
Who are you?

502
00:55:47,606 --> 00:55:49,208
My name is Dr. Milo Sofley

503
00:55:49,865 --> 00:55:51,821
I used to work with your father.

504
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:54,445
I'm filing a lawsuit against him.

505
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:58,183
I'm assuming he hasn't
told you why.

506
00:56:01,748 --> 00:56:02,961
No.

507
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:06,776
What would you say
if I told you I knew

508
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:07,867
what was happening to you?

509
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:11,456
People cope with traumatic
events differently.

510
00:56:11,996 --> 00:56:13,669
Some are worse than others.

511
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,684
What happened to her?

512
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:22,137
This isn't about her, Ethan.

513
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:26,526
This is about you.

514
00:56:29,297 --> 00:56:31,106
How much do you know?

515
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:34,402
I know this is where
my dad works.

516
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:38,567
We're nowhere near
your father now, Ethan.

517
00:56:38,841 --> 00:56:40,307
Or anyone else.

518
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,172
We're in a room

519
00:56:43,196 --> 00:56:45,018
in my house.

520
00:56:50,905 --> 00:56:52,682
Then what's happening to me?

521
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:56,095
Why am I seeing
what I'm seeing?

522
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,809
You are something, Ethan.

523
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:02,709
You really are.

524
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,748
And I think it's
very admirable of you.

525
00:57:08,253 --> 00:57:10,652
Trying to find yourself
in such a way.

526
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,199
Ethan, you're asking
the wrong questions.

527
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,153
You saw the x-rays.

528
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:23,852
What'd you think
that was?

529
00:57:28,853 --> 00:57:30,231
I don't know.

530
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:32,442
It's a microcomputer.

531
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:35,215
A silicon hippo campus chip.

532
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:39,158
We all have memories
which we prefer to forget.

533
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,556
Your father never told
you what he was doing

534
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,581
because he wasn't sure
that it would work.

535
00:57:44,229 --> 00:57:47,243
To be honest, I think
you were in no position to argue with him.

536
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:50,486
The next thing you
knew, you awoke in a hospital,

537
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,514
unaware of any pf this.

538
00:57:53,755 --> 00:57:56,271
Ethan, ever since
your surgery,

539
00:57:56,469 --> 00:57:58,919
You've been combining your
past and your present,

540
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,831
to create your own happiness.

541
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:04,591
Your condition, Ethan,

542
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:06,439
causes you to think your dreams

543
00:58:07,305 --> 00:58:08,980
are real life.

544
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:14,088
It stopped working?

545
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,376
Because I remembered
my brother.

546
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:19,980
No, Ethan.

547
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,150
You don't have
a brother.

548
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,367
It was you.

549
00:59:14,697 --> 00:59:17,347
I need you to come
back to the real world, Ethan.

550
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:20,367
I need you to trust me.

551
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:37,886
This is your house.

552
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,592
Yes, it's...

553
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:43,575
...where we've
been the whole time.

554
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:49,284
Do you understand everything
that I'm telling you, Ethan?

555
00:59:51,974 --> 00:59:55,648
This chip works as
an artificial part of your brain

556
00:59:56,698 --> 00:59:58,698
Because it was damaged,

557
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:01,528
everything that you now remember

558
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,186
is directly connected to
the hippo campus chip.

559
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:14,002
You are dependent on it

560
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,656
For normal functioning.

561
01:00:20,866 --> 01:00:23,005
I don't know what to believe.

562
01:00:26,908 --> 01:00:28,908
Why are you helping me?

563
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:43,045
Ethan!

564
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:45,580
-Ethan!
-What?

565
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,046
What do you want
from me?

566
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:52,290
We have a case, Ethan!

567
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,160
You can't fight back!

568
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,136
Here.

569
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,582
I know everything.

570
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:12,826
Ethan...

571
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,443
It's over.

572
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:07,226
Ethan, I'm...

573
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,068
really not in the mood
right now,

574
01:03:10,093 --> 01:03:11,716
can we just...
-I don't care!

575
01:03:13,733 --> 01:03:15,046
I have something to say.

576
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:16,726
And you're gonna listen.

577
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:20,991
Let go of my hand.

578
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,254
Why?

579
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:26,218
Let go of my hand!

580
01:03:26,243 --> 01:03:28,839
Why should I listen to
anything you have to say?

581
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:31,809
I haven't been in control
of my life in a long time,

582
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:33,028
and I have you to
thank for that.

583
01:03:33,053 --> 01:03:35,543
This is ridic-
it's late!

584
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:37,517
Get out of my room.

585
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:39,542
I wanted to let
you know it's not working.

586
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,536
It stopped working.

587
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:49,662
Ethan...

588
01:03:49,694 --> 01:03:50,832
-I don't think you
understand this...

589
01:03:50,857 --> 01:03:53,982
-I had a talk with Milo
Sofley this afternoon...

590
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,777
Do you know him?

591
01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:59,014
Don't you?

592
01:04:01,072 --> 01:04:02,704
What did he tell you?

593
01:04:02,728 --> 01:04:04,728
I know what you did.

594
01:04:05,435 --> 01:04:06,788
I know everything.

595
01:04:10,603 --> 01:04:11,975
I gave you...

596
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,668
a chance to s...
-No!

597
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:16,672
What you gave me was...

598
01:04:16,697 --> 01:04:19,212
a life that wasn't my own!

599
01:04:22,303 --> 01:04:24,021
I don't want that!

600
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:30,481
You've insulted me.

601
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:39,868
I want you to take it out.

602
01:04:40,934 --> 01:04:43,071
-Well, I don't think you...
-if there's one thing...

603
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:44,737
I will ever ask of you,

604
01:04:45,178 --> 01:04:46,194
This is it.

605
01:04:47,414 --> 01:04:48,859
I'm not broken.

606
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:50,908
You cannot fix

607
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:54,366
whatever it is you think
is wrong with me,

608
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,514
I am who I am.

609
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:02,998
Ethan...

610
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:06,618
This chip is a major
part of your cognitive functioning.

611
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:08,291
If I remove it,

612
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:12,762
it'll be as if we never
had this conversation.

613
01:05:14,597 --> 01:05:16,806
You will not remember
any of this.

614
01:05:17,526 --> 01:05:19,679
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do!

615
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,594
It is your hippo campus. It tells
your memories where to go

616
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,549
and how they will be remembered

617
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:27,495
Without it...

618
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:30,612
Ethan...

619
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:34,707
Please, please, please,
for the love of God.

620
01:05:35,241 --> 01:05:37,116
Do not make this decision.

621
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,849
Despite me.

622
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:42,667
I've been there before.

623
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,457
Haven't I?

624
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,099
If I don't remember
any of this, then that's my decision.

625
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,797
Ethan, please, please, please.

626
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,682
If you won't do it,
I'll call Milo.

627
01:06:18,668 --> 01:06:19,917
Ok.

628
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:22,848
I'll do it.

629
01:06:26,978 --> 01:06:28,057
I'll do it.

630
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,822
Do you remember what
you said when you gave this to me?

631
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,655
No.

632
01:07:06,027 --> 01:07:08,529
You said that it reminded
you of me.

633
01:07:11,435 --> 01:07:13,235
Because I was always happy.

634
01:07:19,926 --> 01:07:22,885
And now the blue
bird reminds me of you.

635
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,086
Wish I had...

636
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:52,564
more things that I could
remember that were happier.

637
01:07:58,515 --> 01:08:01,540
Truthfully you've been upset
for so long, I can't remember

638
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,948
a time when we were happy.

639
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:12,289
But that's why we're here.

640
01:08:14,032 --> 01:08:15,238
I felt angry...

641
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,830
when you drank,

642
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,613
but I still love you.

643
01:08:21,486 --> 01:08:22,961
I felt hurt...

644
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:24,620
and lonely...

645
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:29,449
when you tried to h-

646
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,960
when you tried to hurt yourself.

647
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,370
But I still love you.

648
01:08:41,559 --> 01:08:43,408
I felt upset,

649
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,666
I felt ashamed,

650
01:08:48,662 --> 01:08:51,145
when Ally told me
how she found you,

651
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:55,158
But I still love you.

652
01:08:59,457 --> 01:09:01,343
I hate it when you lie.

653
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:14,372
But I st...

654
01:09:17,983 --> 01:09:19,692
I still love you.

655
01:10:03,104 --> 01:10:04,162
Lucas!

656
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,109
Baby, I'm so glad
you're home!

657
01:10:10,134 --> 01:10:11,717
It's good to be home.

658
01:10:11,742 --> 01:10:13,509
I missed you so much.

659
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:15,657
It's good to see you.

660
01:10:16,681 --> 01:10:18,465
Hey man, welcome home.

661
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,692
Ah, thanks!

662
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:56,073
It's good to see you, man.

663
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:57,972
It's good to be home.

664
01:10:58,665 --> 01:10:59,997
I'm glad you're back.

665
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,755
-Yeah, me, too.

666
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,388
Thanks.

667
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:21,553
Let's go back
inside, alright?

668
01:11:24,195 --> 01:11:25,281
You coming?

669
01:11:28,337 --> 01:11:30,769
I think I'm going to stay
 out here for a little while.

670
01:15:57,222 --> 01:15:58,778
Can you see me?

671
01:15:59,089 --> 01:16:01,089
Can you see your son?

672
01:16:02,612 --> 01:16:04,612
You promised me!

673
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:07,903
You promised!

674
01:16:25,139 --> 01:16:26,220
Milo, tell him what happened.

675
01:16:26,245 --> 01:16:27,745
Ethan, please, please.

676
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:29,755
Just calm down.

677
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:47,750
Truth...

678
01:16:50,221 --> 01:16:52,623
is in fact the most
important piece of information

679
01:16:52,648 --> 01:16:53,950
in any event with such
discrepancies

680
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,803
as the ones we've
been faced with here.

681
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:04,265
The brain is the most powerful...

682
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:06,874
and fragile part of the human body.

683
01:17:09,277 --> 01:17:10,419
But in this case,

684
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:13,609
it's the object in question.

685
01:17:15,973 --> 01:17:17,928
Mr. Ethan Galloway will
further undergo a

686
01:17:17,953 --> 01:17:19,953
series of BCI tests,

687
01:17:20,391 --> 01:17:23,463
which record the exact radioactivity
that his brain emits.

688
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:26,809
This tests do not confabulate.

689
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:28,620
And they will be done
before and after

690
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,373
the removal of the
hippo campus chip.

691
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:37,243
He's the son of Charles Galloway
whose wishes will be granted.

692
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,892
No matter how serious
the consequences.

693
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:57,055
This is it.

694
01:18:02,686 --> 01:18:04,832
You have to be sure
that this is really what you want

695
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:06,413
before you take this pill.

696
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:12,791
After this,

697
01:18:12,815 --> 01:18:14,815
there's no turning back.

698
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:22,812
Ethan!

699
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:50,962
You know I won't
remember any of this.

700
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:56,398
Yes you will.
