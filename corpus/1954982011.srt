1
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,794
Jenny!

2
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:19,170
Where you going?

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,290
This place is
going to be perfect.

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,670
You're perfect.

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,930
Why?

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,590
Help me!

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,018
Help me!

8
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,449
Help me!

9
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:42,720
You're helping me!

10
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:55,207
Jenny, thank you.

11
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:07,090
I should have my father sue
your practice for everything

12
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,740
that it's worth.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,519
You mark my words.

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,940
By the end of this,
you'll regret you

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,971
had anything to do with this.

16
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,570
All right.
Thank you very much.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,710
Not what we're looking for.

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,830
Good job though.

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,560
Yeah.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,260
We're just looking for something
really specific, you know?

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,513
You've kind of got,
like, a blonde Sandra

22
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:30,016
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:33,040
And we're looking for more
like a blonde Cate Blanchett

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,940
or a blonde Whoopi Goldberg.

25
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,950
Yeah.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,685
Your eye contact throughout
was impeccable, I thought.

27
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:40,138
Yeah, Phenomenal eye contact.

28
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:43,746
Is that you?

29
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,501
Yeah.

30
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,231
Good.

31
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,225
I'm taking the car.

32
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:49,760
I've got to be at work
in, like, 15 minutes.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,306
OK.

34
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:55,000
How about putting some
gas in it for once?

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,252
Okey dokey, artichokey.

36
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:11,870
) Hey, what's up?

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,610
Hey.

38
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,170
<i>) Can I call
you back in a few minutes?</i>

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,310
I'm almost at the club.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,810
Yeah.

41
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,880
You going in already?

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
It's, like, six o'clock.

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,160
) Well,
Ricky wanted me in early.

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,228
You said you were
going to give me a ride.

45
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,061
) I forgot.

46
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,280
Fuck it.

47
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Charlotte, did you
clean the kennel?

48
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,980
No, give me a minute.

49
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,765
Do it.

50
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:35,800
The back porch smells
like puppy shit.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,140
Do you feed her
people food again?

52
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,530
Can you give me ride to work?

53
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,690
No, I've gotta go.

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,760
Look, I would.

55
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,485
But if I'm late again, William
says I don't get the raise.

56
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:51,184
And if I don't get the raise, I
have to live with you forever.

57
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:53,620
I think I'm going to go
crazy if I have to live here

58
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,600
for another six months.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,220
You have my lighter, mom?

60
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,480
Um, no.

61
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,150
Just use the stove.

62
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,298
Bye.

63
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,040
Love you.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,189
Bye.

65
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:26,370
) Good stuff
coming right back at you.

66
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,242
Good afternoon, Broadleaf.

67
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:30,170
We're into the evening
really on the way.

68
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,260
It's going to be a hot
one tonight tonight.

69
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,930
Incredible day on
the coast today.

70
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,741
Music coming up will be hot too.

71
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,700
Lots of people calling
in killer requests.

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,070
And whatever you're up to,
thanks for taking us along.

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,986
Wherever you're headed,
we'll get you through.

74
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:42,960
And I want to say
shout out to our buddy,

75
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
Mike Kirkpatrick,
local TV news photog.

76
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,424
Hey man, if you're
listening, call in, Mike.

77
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,450
Or if anybody's seen him,
kind of a missing person's

78
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,230
thing now.

79
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,872
They always say those news
guys are on assignment,

80
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:53,830
but this is a bit much.

81
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm sure she's cute,
Mike, whoever she is.

82
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,685
But call in, buddy.

83
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:58,280
Hit us up on the studio line.

84
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,430
Took you long enough.

85
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,965
Hey, come here a second.

86
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,720
What?

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,754
You should smile
a little bit more.

88
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:03,230
Here.

89
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,528
You forgot my tip.

90
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:07,252
Ow!

91
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,012
Mother fucker, man!

92
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:09,962
Asshole!

93
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,690
You don't have to grab me, man.

94
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:29,794
Jim, what the fuck
is your problem?

95
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:32,194
Jesus.

96
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:33,738
Get the fuck off him.

97
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:37,316
Are you OK?

98
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,166
Shit.

99
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,370
Hey.

100
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,165
You care so much
about these assholes,

101
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,510
you clean that shit up.

102
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,515
Just trying to a
shot of the building.

103
00:08:58,424 --> 00:09:01,409
I got your camera
too, dickhead.

104
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:08,264
Hey, you got a car?

105
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,570
Mmm.

106
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,620
Pumpkin spice.

107
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,490
My favorite.

108
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,740
You want a hot dog?

109
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,087
Your mom bought five today.

110
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,210
Shut the hell up.

111
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,070
$1.60.

112
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,911
You need anything else?

113
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,902
You sure you don't
want a hot dog?

114
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,905
Hey.

115
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,742
You alive?

116
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,995
I'm cold.

117
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,183
Here.

118
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,007
Thanks.

119
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,325
Yeah, no problem.

120
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,930
You OK?

121
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,421
Did you give me this blanket?

122
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,560
Yeah, I did.

123
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,530
Where'd you get it?

124
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,387
Up the road.

125
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,110
It's pink.

126
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,803
Yeah.

127
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,729
What's your favorite color?

128
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,758
Green.

129
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:40,955
Green.

130
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:41,684
Yeah.

131
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,591
Why?

132
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,800
Like the ocean.

133
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,870
Do you always hang
out with strange people

134
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,850
and drive their cars around?

135
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,189
I do.

136
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,293
Every time I get the chance.

137
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,920
It's like a hobby of mine.

138
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,540
Should I be scared?

139
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,551
Do I scare you?

140
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,200
No.

141
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,234
Do you scare-- do I scare you?

142
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,346
I'm not afraid of you.

143
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,076
I'm bleeding.

144
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,610
Yeah.

145
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,382
You got the shit
knocked out of you.

146
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,037
What do you do?

147
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,310
I make movies.

148
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:48,621
Yeah?

149
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,553
You make movies?

150
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,870
No, not really.

151
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:01,355
Um, I'm an actress or, you
know, I'm trying to be at least.

152
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,661
There's not a lot going
on right now, you know?

153
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,338
What do you mean?

154
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,430
I've done a couple, like,
music videos and stuff,

155
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,324
but I want to work on
projects where I actually

156
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,208
have a speaking part, you know?

157
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,124
Yeah, that would be nice.

158
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,525
You gonna smoke that thing?

159
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:31,987
Yeah, are you down?

160
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,918
Yeah, I'm down.

161
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,060
Where are we?

162
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,890
You don't mind
getting blood on it?

163
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,020
It's cool.

164
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,640
Careful.

165
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,857
Don't hurt yourself.

166
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,550
I didn't spill
anymore coffee, did I?

167
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,870
No, you're good.

168
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,970
You're good.

169
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,556
Hey, you're really cool.

170
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,715
Thanks.

171
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,328
I'm Charlotte by the way.

172
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,102
David.

173
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,150
David.

174
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,749
David what?

175
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,640
David, your friend.

176
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,570
We are friends, huh?

177
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,248
Yeah, we're hanging
out like friends.

178
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,604
I don't have many friends.

179
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,336
Yeah, me neither.

180
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,969
I'll be right back.

181
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:02,298
OK.

182
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:26,346
Hey.

183
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,516
Um, here.

184
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,231
It's a head shot.

185
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,000
Um, not to sound
cheesy or anything,

186
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,090
but just keep me
in mind if you ever

187
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,984
have any projects or anything.

188
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,632
I will.

189
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,722
Cool.

190
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:42,940
OK.

191
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,780
Hold on a second.

192
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,600
This is my number.

193
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,290
Give me a call anytime.

194
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,070
And whenever you figure out
the situation with the camera,

195
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,085
just--

196
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:52,795
Yeah.

197
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:53,560
Yeah, I will.

198
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,160
I'd really-- really
appreciate it.

199
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,467
Yeah, no problem.

200
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:57,487
Bye.

201
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,711
Hey!

202
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,861
Fuck!

203
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,380
Fuck, dude.

204
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,630
You scared the fuck out of me.

205
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,360
Fuck, man.

206
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,724
Are you rolling on this?

207
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:14,390
Is this rolling?

208
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,890
Yeah.

209
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,430
OK.

210
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,140
Hey, Jay Harper.

211
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,070
Nice to meet you.

212
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,027
Very excited to be here.

213
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:19,610
Ah, shit, man.

214
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,318
Good to meet you.

215
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:21,370
You must be David, right?

216
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:21,870
Yeah.

217
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,730
You talking to me or the camera?

218
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,220
Um, I'm talking to you
and the camera, David.

219
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,150
Oh, shit, man.

220
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,020
Well, cool.

221
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,172
What are we doing today?

222
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,600
You're going to do a little
bit of everything today.

223
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,570
OK, alright, great.

224
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,860
I mean, I can edit,
shoot, direct.

225
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,669
I can load.

226
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:39,300
I'm casting my own feature
right now so it's just like,

227
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,330
you know, but whatever
you want, man.

228
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,970
I'm a jack of all trades.

229
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,040
Master of none.

230
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,930
Yeah, master of--
master of none.

231
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,050
So what are we doing first?

232
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,050
I'm going to have
you take the camera--

233
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,770
OK.

234
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,320
--and you're going to
capture beautiful moments.

235
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,060
OK.

236
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,250
So do you want me to just
roll with it all day?

237
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,985
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,465
How much tape do we have left
on this just so I know before

239
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,930
we run out because
I don't want to--

240
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,378
Don't worry about
technical aspects, OK?

241
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,600
OK.

242
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,550
I got it handled.

243
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,008
I just want you to
take the camera.

244
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:13,280
We're going to make this movie.

245
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,100
All right, man.

246
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,950
Here.

247
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,720
You ever been back
this deep, Jay?

248
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,440
Oh, yeah, man.

249
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,370
I've got family in all
parts of the state.

250
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,728
So I've been around.

251
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,240
It's great back here, man.

252
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,950
Yeah it is.

253
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,930
I love the way
this thing handles.

254
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,470
Oh, I know.

255
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,560
It's perfect for the offroading.

256
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,810
What are you going
to do with that?

257
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,670
You gotta protect
yourself out here, man.

258
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,270
What?

259
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,074
Yeah, you don't know
what's going to happen.

260
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,098
Bears and shit.

261
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,108
Whoa!

262
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,340
Hey, Jay.

263
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,715
We're doing an
establishing shot.

264
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,732
I need you to walk
towards the barn.

265
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,580
All right.

266
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,990
Wait for action.

267
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,010
Wait for action.

268
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,545
Go back to one.

269
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,690
And action!

270
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,830
So where's the
rest of the crew at?

271
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,454
Ah, don't worry
about that, Jay.

272
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,830
I'm going to have you act today.

273
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,820
Can you act?

274
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,880
Sure, yeah.

275
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,830
You good?

276
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,071
I mean, I can stand in.

277
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,160
Yeah.

278
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,470
I like that attitude.

279
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,780
How do you feel about nudity?

280
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,730
Partial nudity?

281
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,870
Just your shirt?

282
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,696
Are you going to
be rolling on that?

283
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,490
Yeah, I'm going
to be rolling, man.

284
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,210
Why?

285
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,180
Why do you need to
see me partially nude?

286
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,680
I told you earlier, Jay, we're
going to capture every moment.

287
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,420
And besides, I want to know
what you look like on camera.

288
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,919
So take your shirt off.

289
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:53,665
Just the shirt?

290
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:54,460
Yeah, just the shirt.

291
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,239
I promise.

292
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,892
You got a bug bite.

293
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:05,190
Your zipper's down too.

294
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,852
Hey, dude, what the fuck?

295
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:07,630
It's still down.

296
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,390
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,730
I didn't get it all the way.

298
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,670
Zip it up.

299
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,527
Just tell me.

300
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,260
I'm just trying to
help you out, man.

301
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,970
Come here.

302
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,690
Relax.

303
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,390
Relax.

304
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,359
I'm hands on.

305
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,150
Look at this place.

306
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,750
It's beautiful.

307
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,200
It's a perfect place to
shoot a murder-- horror.

308
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,890
You OK?

309
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,630
You OK?

310
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,200
Relax, man.

311
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,740
Relax.

312
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

313
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm fine.

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,569
So what do we've got to do?

315
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:35,020
We're going to
shoot this movie, OK?

316
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,210
OK.

317
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,126
You're gonna do good.

318
00:22:37,126 --> 00:22:39,350
Come on.

319
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,486
You need to buy
some new deodorant.

320
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,676
On-set etiquette.

321
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:44,520
Come on.

322
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,394
Let's go.

323
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:50,140
Man, look at all this shit.

324
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,990
Hey, Jay, what are you doing?

325
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,904
I'm just catching
some B-roll footage.

326
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:55,460
We don't have for
that shit, man.

327
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,751
I want you to shoot the
artsiest thing you can in here.

328
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,490
All right.

329
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,070
We got a lot to do today.

330
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,230
F-stops, light balances,
shutter speeds.

331
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,690
ISOs.

332
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,180
All that shit is happening, man.

333
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,380
Shoot some artsy shit.

334
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,450
All right.

335
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,800
You see that light coming in
over there through the boards?

336
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,530
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,030
How do you want me
to turn that up?

338
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,900
Go ahead and move to
your left a little bit.

339
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,400
All right.

340
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm gonna go get
you the tripod, man.

341
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,846
You need it.

342
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:24,602
I like you though, man.

343
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:26,570
God, that's a
weird mother fucker.

344
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,390
That's a lot of hunting.

345
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:49,532
Jay!

346
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,519
Jay!

347
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,510
The movie, Jay?

348
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,140
Come on!

349
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,480
Jay!

350
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:14,566
You did good, buddy.

351
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:16,538
You did real good.

352
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,085
Wave.

353
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:19,375
Bye!

354
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,323
Hey, Jay, Jay.

355
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:29,173
Listen up.

356
00:24:29,173 --> 00:24:31,278
I've got something to tell you.

357
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,216
Don't be scared.

358
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,160
You're part of something
special, something

359
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,920
bigger than both of us.

360
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:50,874
Good night.

361
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:52,616
Good night, Jay.

362
00:25:58,152 --> 00:26:01,306
The movie, Jay?

363
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:02,950
Come on, Jay!

364
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,644
Come on, Jay!

365
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:08,069
I'm not gonna shoot you.

366
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,044
Jay!

367
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,224
Jay!

368
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,783
You did good, buddy.

369
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:21,846
No, no, no, no.

370
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,913
You OK?

371
00:26:25,913 --> 00:26:27,831
You OK?

372
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,871
Huh?

373
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,210
Ah!

374
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:40,793
Give it to me!

375
00:26:40,793 --> 00:26:42,182
Give it to me!

376
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:45,058
Give it to me!

377
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,020
You're tricky, huh?

378
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,170
You were born
to feed on others.

379
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,862
Born to take advantage.

380
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:43,213
Latching on, digging deep.

381
00:27:44,234 --> 00:27:46,572
Drinking your victim dry.

382
00:27:48,787 --> 00:27:50,915
Blood-sucking parasite.

383
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:54,220
Your days are numbered.

384
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:33,700
Hey, you know what?

385
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,823
You know what?

386
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:37,340
I am telling you, my friend,
this is easy money for you.

387
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,590
Yeah.

388
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,660
It's a cake walk.

389
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,170
I'm telling you.

390
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,414
All right?

391
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:43,990
So I'll see you in
about a half an hour.

392
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,580
OK?

393
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,380
You guys have a drink,
relax, I'll see you.

394
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,120
OK, bye.

395
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,900
Holy God Almighty.

396
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,550
What?

397
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,430
No, I'm heading over
there right now.

398
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,130
OK?

399
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,790
I'll call you when I'm done.

400
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,850
Look, I've got
this under control.

401
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,210
It's no big deal.

402
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,650
OK?

403
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,720
This is an easy sell for me.

404
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,320
I got it under control.

405
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,890
What did I just say?

406
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,450
I said I would call
you when I'm done.

407
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,012
All right?

408
00:29:25,441 --> 00:29:26,430
Bye.

409
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:33,390
) Oh, well, yeah.

410
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,140
Well, I hope you can
sell this thing, Frank.

411
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,780
Mother fucker.

412
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,706
You've got to be kidding me.

413
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,550
Why don't you just
shut the fuck up.

414
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,470
) Why don't
you shut the fuck up?

415
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,305
I'm going to offer him the
same percentage this time, man.

416
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:42,660
)
That's not enough.

417
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,900
They're going to put down 80.

418
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,470
) OK.

419
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,969
You know?

420
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,860
You take 20, buy that
fucking TV you always wanted.

421
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,740
I take 20.

422
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,250
)
That sounds good.

423
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,785
I guarantee you, we can shoot
this thing for 30, no problem.

424
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:52,910
)
I'm sure we could.

425
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,950
And that leaves us 10
for the wrap party, man.

426
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,440
) Red
carpet time, baby.

427
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,380
You know what?

428
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,590
This time, no more
cheap fucking champagne.

429
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,860
I want Dom this time and
I want a stretch limo.

430
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,430
) I hear you.

431
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,100
And some strippers.

432
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,599
Exactly.

433
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,218
And all we've gotta come up
with is 20 to pay the crew.

434
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,466
) Yeah.

435
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:12,080
Fellas, this is
a fail-safe plan.

436
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,260
I've seen the drama.

437
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,170
I know how it works.

438
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,390
I own the DVD set.

439
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,110
I want Blu-ray.

440
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,475
Hey, what's it take to
get a fucking drink?

441
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:24,255
Alright.

442
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,225
Before we get crazy--

443
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,100
Don't get crazy on me.

444
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,211
--what's our guarantee?

445
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:28,130
Guarantee.

446
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,980
How do we know we're going
to get our money back.

447
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm just kind of concerned
about the timeline.

448
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,290
Me and my girl, we just got
engaged when I got back.

449
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,644
to eat.

450
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:36,953
Are we doing good over here?

451
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:37,772
Doing well.

452
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:39,260
Thanks.

453
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,520
What I want you guys to do is I
want you to take this contract,

454
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,636
look at it tonight, sign it,

455
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,702
get back with me tomorrow.

456
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,030
OK?

457
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,880
It's going to happen
with you or without you.

458
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,284
We are going to make a
lot of money on this.

459
00:30:59,284 --> 00:31:00,300
You can buy air time?

460
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,490
Yes, we can buy air time.

461
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,543
And we are going to make a
shitload more money selling

462
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:06,583
advertising.

463
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:09,677
OK?

464
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:12,181
Just think about it.

465
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,300
This is our chance
to do something big.

466
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,720
So I'm in.

467
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,554
Let's do it.

468
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,194
Ah, fuck it.

469
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:24,926
Balls.

470
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,665
It takes balls.

471
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,485
And two have got them.

472
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:37,288
Yeah.

473
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:38,227
I've got the money.

474
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:40,030
They signed on the dotted line.

475
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,205
Yes, that they-- I
told you they'd do it.

476
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:44,175
You got to relax
just a little bit

477
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,256
and trust me a little more, OK?

478
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,920
I trust you.

479
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,364
I trust you.

480
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:57,620
But what if your little soldier
boys want a return right away?

481
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,660
Well, what then?

482
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,960
They always want
their money back.

483
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,724
If they want their
fucking money back,

484
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:05,590
they reenlist another
two fucking years.

485
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,540
I don't give a fuck.

486
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,476
What's it, four years?

487
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,017
I don't know.

488
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:09,940
Listen, I don't give a shit.

489
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,410
I'm counting on you.

490
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,440
Huh?

491
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,840
What?

492
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,640
Hold on.

493
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,770
I gotta call you back, OK?

494
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,491
Alright, call me back later.

495
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:21,480
Fill that up.

496
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,390
Oh, that is wonderful.

497
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,330
That is really good.

498
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,250
Frank.

499
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,905
Did you drink too much again?

500
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,840
Wanna go for a ride?

501
00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:01,220
You don't mind if I take this
for a spin, do you Frank?

502
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,087
You're really living
the life, man.

503
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:22,064
That's a beautiful picture too.

504
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,390
You ready to party tonight?

505
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,250
We're going to have
fun, just me and you.

506
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,888
We're gonna roll down the strip
and check out all the chicks.

507
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,862
I got a producer in the car.

508
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,059
Oh, yeah.

509
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:44,968
Woo!

510
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:47,962
That's luxury, Frank.

511
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:51,193
You ready?

512
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,720
He wasn't even in the club, OK?

513
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,790
He said he wasn't going
to come around anymore.

514
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,620
Jim just took it.

515
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,170
I know what Jim did.

516
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,080
Look, I don't have time
for this right now.

517
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,230
I got a lot going on.

518
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,815
I got a busy schedule.

519
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,600
Hey, Raven.

520
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,083
Get your little ass in here.

521
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,070
Look I need it OK?

522
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,010
We're working on a
project together.

523
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,120
Fine.

524
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,862
Take the fucking camera.

525
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,050
I heard about that little stunt
you pulled the other night.

526
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:41,463
He's a big spender,
a high roller.

527
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,951
Next time, keep your
fucking hands to yourself.

528
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,044
You want to be an
arm's length away,

529
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,863
slide your ass up on that stage
and go swing on that pole.

530
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,905
If it happens again, just smile.

531
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:58,592
Pretend you like it.

532
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,614
Deep down, I know that you do.

533
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,069
You're such a fucking asshole.

534
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,340
Get out of here.

535
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,570
I got work to do.

536
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,202
God, she's such a bitch.

537
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:12,854
Yeah, she is.

538
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,427
Oh, yeah.

539
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,250
be here by 6:00 tomorrow.

540
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,710
Yeah.

541
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,282
That's good.

542
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,764
Hey, I hope you're comfortable.

543
00:35:42,764 --> 00:35:44,020
Sorry about the
restraints, Frank.

544
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,800
Just take this off.

545
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,591
Please take it off.

546
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:48,732
I had to make sure you're not
going to move around too much.

547
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,842
God damn it.

548
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:51,858
Help!

549
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,812
Help!

550
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:55,665
Nobody's gonna help you, Frank.

551
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:56,870
I got you, man.

552
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,855
Mother fucker.

553
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,450
Just take this fucking
shit off of me please.

554
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,428
What do you want?

555
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:02,830
I will give you
whatever you want.

556
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,246
I will give you
whatever you want.

557
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,084
Look at the camera!

558
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:05,875
Look at the camera!

559
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:06,580
That's what I want.

560
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,900
OK, I'm looking at the camera.

561
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,510
All right?

562
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,117
I'm looking at your
fucking camera.

563
00:36:10,117 --> 00:36:10,817
Shh.

564
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:11,624
Shh.

565
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:12,363
Listen.

566
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:15,454
Listen This is the last time
you could actually listen.

567
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:17,910
I have something I
want you to know.

568
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,786
It's special.

569
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:20,740
It's so special.

570
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,830
What is it?

571
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,390
I want you to
remember something.

572
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,604
What do you want
me to remember?

573
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:26,190
Just tell me what it is.

574
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,700
When you go to
the other place,

575
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,092
I want to know what it's like
because I'll see you later.

576
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:33,772
I'll see you later.

577
00:36:33,772 --> 00:36:35,370
Help!

578
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,530
Hey, what's your name?

579
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,555
What is your name?

580
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,286
Come on, man.

581
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:45,234
What the fuck?

582
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:46,440
God damn it!

583
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,470
You like my sculpture?

584
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,384
It's almost done.

585
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:50,342
Please take these off.

586
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,675
Hey, you want money?

587
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:52,470
You want money?

588
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,730
It's not going to hurt you.

589
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,740
I'll give you as much
money as you need.

590
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,708
I'll give it to you.

591
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:56,208
No!

592
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:56,898
No!

593
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:58,468
No!

594
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,724
How does that feel, Frank?

595
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:01,814
Yeah!

596
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:30,940
Hello?

597
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,810
Hey, David.

598
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,581
It's Charlotte.

599
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,420
Hey, I got your camera back.

600
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,104
Thanks.

601
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,150
I got this project I want
to talk to you about.

602
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,359
Maybe we can get
together this week?

603
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:45,570
I'm free tomorrow.

604
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,136
I'm not working.

605
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,142
Um, is there a place maybe
we can get together, like,

606
00:37:53,142 --> 00:37:55,110
near your house or something?

607
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:58,235
Yeah, you want to meet me
down at Greenfield Lake maybe

608
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,650
around 4 o'clock?

609
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,810
You know where that is?

610
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,310
Uh, huh.

611
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,390
Yeah.

612
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,946
I'll find it.

613
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:06,316
Hello?

614
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:09,554
Hello?

615
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,560
Yeah, I'll find it, man.

616
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,468
Good lord, save me.

617
00:38:58,468 --> 00:39:03,998
The devil's hand holds me.

618
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:19,204
Bright light I see.

619
00:39:19,614 --> 00:39:23,418
Jesus, guide me.

620
00:40:59,714 --> 00:41:01,530
Hey.

621
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,470
Hey.

622
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,310
You found me.

623
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,560
Yeah.

624
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:07,350
You're pretty easy to find.

625
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,376
How are you?

626
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,410
I'm great.

627
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,460
How are you doing?

628
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,770
I'm doing good.

629
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,650
Cool.

630
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,350
You want to sit down?

631
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,850
Yeah.

632
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,682
Thanks.

633
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:19,030
What's with the producer tag?

634
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,950
Oh, it's just a stupid show
I'm working on right now.

635
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,850
It's cheesy.

636
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,180
You wouldn't like it.

637
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,010
I think I've seen
something on that.

638
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,480
It's the one-- the guy with
all the one-liners, right?

639
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,910
Yeah.

640
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,970
That's cool.

641
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,728
They messed up my
picture and my name.

642
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,672
Oh.

643
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:38,080
Um, here.

644
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,212
I brought your camera for you.

645
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,290
I forgot I had this.

646
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,800
Really?

647
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,752
I got a lot of them.

648
00:41:45,752 --> 00:41:47,240
Right.

649
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,180
Thank you so much.

650
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah, not a problem.

651
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,120
It's really sweet.

652
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,868
It's not a big deal.

653
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,673
Did you have a hard
time getting it back?

654
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,594
I quit.

655
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,230
You quit?

656
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,270
Yeah.

657
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,770
What are you going to do?

658
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,055
I don't know.

659
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,450
I just got tired of doing
something I hate every day

660
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,370
so I could be happy later.

661
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,190
You know?

662
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,540
What is that, like, waiting
for your life to start?

663
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,480
Life is right now.

664
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,100
It's just--

665
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,537
This is our life.

666
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:23,940
Yeah.

667
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,375
I'm just ready to go somewhere.

668
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:30,038
I wish I could do
something big, you know?

669
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,040
I think fate
brought us together.

670
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,055
That's big.

671
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:35,930
You believe in that?

672
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,050
Destiny?

673
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,551
Yeah.

674
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,299
Yeah.

675
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,827
I think everything happens
for a reason, for sure.

676
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,200
It's so beautiful out here.

677
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,310
I know.

678
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,360
It's gorgeous.

679
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,501
I would love to just sit under
this tree with you all day.

680
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,510
I gotta get going though.

681
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,141
You have somewhere to be?

682
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:57,870
Yeah, I gotta be on set.

683
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,250
Oh, that's cool.

684
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,220
You want to go with me?

685
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,642
Really?

686
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:06,584
No, I can't take you.

687
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,340
Oh.

688
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,180
No, it's fine.

689
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,993
I've got somewhere to be anyway.

690
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,120
I still want to
work with you though.

691
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,710
Yeah?

692
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,670
I think we're
going to do-- I know

693
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,175
we're going to do
beautiful things together.

694
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,572
Cool.

695
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:24,837
I'm down with that.

696
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,393
Me too.

697
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,560
Well, I've got
tons of free time

698
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,440
now so you know how
to get up with me.

699
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,110
I'll be around.

700
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,728
I'll just run
into you somewhere.

701
00:43:37,526 --> 00:43:38,462
Yeah.

702
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:39,750
See you later?

703
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,567
OK.

704
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,530
Bye.

705
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,230
We've got four bodies.

706
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,584
Three male, one female.

707
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,487
And they all appear
to be decapitated.

708
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,723
Well, John, I guess
they should have quit

709
00:44:25,274 --> 00:44:27,210
while they were still ahead.

710
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:32,595
All right, cut, cut.
That's good!

711
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:34,013
Hey, check the gate.

712
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:35,556
If the gate--

713
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:37,850
I think that's as
high as it's going to go.

714
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,646
Listen, Sydney.

715
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:40,600
I told you $8,000 and that's it.

716
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,620
But they
don't have the money--

717
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,461
I pay your fucking mortgage
with the commission,

718
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:45,401
so shut the fuck up,
do what I tell you.

719
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:47,159
Listen, I'm
doing the best I can.

720
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,385
Shut the fuck up!

721
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:49,300
Jesus.

722
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,366
Where's that water I asked
for five minutes ago?

723
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,452
God damn, Neanderthals.

724
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:56,710
Woohoo!

725
00:44:57,558 --> 00:44:59,722
Hey, Nathan!

726
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,550
You're looking good, man.

727
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,152
You killed that last scene.

728
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,317
Thanks.

729
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,962
Who are you?

730
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:11,920
I'm a producer.

731
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,631
I got this--

732
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,021
Before you go on, you
need to talk to my agent.

733
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:17,710
OK?

734
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,433
And if you don't have a budget,
fucking forget about it.

735
00:45:20,766 --> 00:45:21,819
All right?

736
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:22,850
Give me that.

737
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,291
I've got some shit to do.

738
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:33,390
If you see me walking towards
you, get out of the way.

739
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,050
Thank you.

740
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,544
Yeah, I'm the star.

741
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,742
Can I get a fruit cup please?

742
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:40,003
Who's
got eyes on Marco?

743
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:40,944
I need Marco.

744
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:42,785
Somebody get Marco.

745
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,947
I've been watching you.

746
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:51,740
I've noticed your beauty.

747
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:56,199
You're cunning.

748
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,558
You're sneaky and I like it.

749
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:08,582
These traits, these masks that
you wear, they don't fool me.

750
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,360
They won't help you
escape your fate.

751
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,658
Woohoo!

752
00:48:18,144 --> 00:48:19,277
Hey!

753
00:48:19,478 --> 00:48:20,594
Hey!

754
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:22,128
What the fuck are you doing?

755
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:26,316
Hey!

756
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,720
Hey, bro!

757
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,950
What are you doing?

758
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,110
I can't hear you.

759
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,105
My ears are under water.

760
00:48:32,586 --> 00:48:34,206
I love your place, man.

761
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,691
Oh, I would live
here in a heartbeat.

762
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,860
You really made it big.

763
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,032
Get the fuck out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

764
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:41,980
OK?

765
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,840
Be cool, man.

766
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,980
I think-- I think you're,
uh, misjudging me.

767
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,750
I'm David.

768
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,860
We met earlier, remember?

769
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,991
On set?

770
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:52,150
I was that guy that
had that project

771
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,085
I wanted to talk to you about.

772
00:48:53,085 --> 00:48:53,710
Yeah, yeah.

773
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,361
I got it.

774
00:48:54,361 --> 00:48:54,860
All right.

775
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,220
Listen, you have 60 seconds
to get the fuck out of here

776
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,901
or I'm gonna smash your face in.

777
00:48:58,901 --> 00:48:59,630
OK?

778
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,743
This shit is really good.

779
00:49:00,743 --> 00:49:01,610
You want a glass?

780
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,650
Are you drinking my--

781
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:03,439
Uh, huh.

782
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,902
I also saw that picture
of your wife inside.

783
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,360
She is hot.

784
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,970
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

785
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,390
You know she's hot, man.

786
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,678
But I got this and I would
love you to sign it for me.

787
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,098
To David, my number one fan.

788
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,230
I love you.

789
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,692
You're fucking kidding me.

790
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,460
You're fucking kidding me.

791
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,000
Come on, bro.

792
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,355
It's all good.

793
00:49:26,355 --> 00:49:26,855
No.

794
00:49:26,855 --> 00:49:27,800
Fuck no.

795
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:29,430
I'm calling the cops
before I kill you.

796
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,020
Look.

797
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,990
I got this project I want
to talk to you about.

798
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,870
I think you're going
to be perfect for it.

799
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:50,190
Nathan!

800
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:51,885
Wake up, sleepy head!

801
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:54,090
Woo!

802
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,020
I see you!

803
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,755
I'm so happy you decided
to do this project, Nathan.

804
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,871
I hope you like that wardrobe
I picked out for you specially.

805
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:12,342
Are you excited?

806
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,502
You look good in purple.

807
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:14,747
What the fuck is going on?

808
00:50:14,747 --> 00:50:15,467
Listen.

809
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,751
Don't jump the gun, Nathan.

810
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:18,512
I know you're a bit
of a method actor,

811
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:21,238
but you're going to have to
fucking read the script first.

812
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:23,484
You better appreciate
what I'm doing for you.

813
00:50:23,484 --> 00:50:24,810
What are you talking about?

814
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,679
Where the hell am I?

815
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:28,730
We're not playing
games all night, Nathan.

816
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,000
I paid you upfront
to do the job.

817
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,295
Now do it.

818
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,087
Check your left breast
pocket in your jacket.

819
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,420
I know you like money.

820
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,636
Is this a joke?

821
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:42,246
No.

822
00:50:42,246 --> 00:50:43,202
Huh?

823
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:44,160
Are you kidding?

824
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,248
Get the fuck out of here, man.

825
00:50:51,344 --> 00:50:52,524
Uh oh.

826
00:50:55,526 --> 00:50:56,956
No running!

827
00:50:57,538 --> 00:50:59,774
No running, Nathan.

828
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:01,957
Just acting.

829
00:51:01,957 --> 00:51:03,694
Good acting.

830
00:51:03,913 --> 00:51:07,044
Pick up the script and
read your fucking lines.

831
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,000
OK?

832
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,135
You would have had a lot
more time if you just

833
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:15,321
woke up earlier.

834
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,880
That means hurry the fuck up.

835
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,260
The cameras are rolling.

836
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,870
We gotta go.

837
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:27,578
You don't want to disappoint me.

838
00:51:27,578 --> 00:51:29,350
This is fucking ridiculous!

839
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,148
Fuck!

840
00:51:31,148 --> 00:51:31,867
OK!

841
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:32,637
OK!

842
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:38,670
If I didn't walk out
that door, I would--

843
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:41,855
Fucking stop doing that!

844
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:42,960
Stop!

845
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,324
I'm not buying it, Nathan.

846
00:51:44,324 --> 00:51:45,800
It's bullshit.

847
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,508
You're way better than this.

848
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:49,830
I handpicked you because of it.

849
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,174
I would have resented her
for the rest of my life.

850
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,741
For the rest of my life.

851
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,210
I am not dealing
with you bullshit anymore.

852
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,697
It's not bullshit, Charlotte.

853
00:52:03,697 --> 00:52:04,740
I'm telling you the truth.

854
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,410
You know, you have never been
good at making decisions.

855
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,620
Your-- your priorities
are all wrong.

856
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,884
What are you even
saying to me right now?

857
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:27,940
Look, I just-- I just think
that you need to have something

858
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,390
to fall back on, OK?

859
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,850
I mean, living like you're
going to get rich, make it big.

860
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,610
That doesn't happen
to people like us.

861
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,350
You are a regular person.

862
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:39,860
OK, you need to focus
on, you know, being happy

863
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,205
in your life right now.

864
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:43,895
You ain't going to
be no movie star.

865
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:44,770
Jesus.

866
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,100
Regular person, huh?

867
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,057
What, like you?

868
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,404
Where are you going?

869
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,945
Hello?

870
00:52:58,279 --> 00:52:59,650
Hey.

871
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,490
David, it's Charlotte.

872
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,230
Hey.

873
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:04,513
I was just thinking about you.

874
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:07,372
Ah, yeah.

875
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,215
I was just needing to get
out of the house, I guess.

876
00:53:12,758 --> 00:53:14,430
I don't know.

877
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,620
Are you busy?

878
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,350
Yeah.

879
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,790
I got-- I got this stuff
that I gotta finish up.

880
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,941
How about we meet up at
whitey's around 8:00?

881
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:24,780
Yeah.

882
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,280
OK.

883
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,644
That works.

884
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:27,424
Yeah.

885
00:53:27,424 --> 00:53:28,309
Bye.

886
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:34,540
Oh, Charlotte.

887
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,795
Do you have a date?

888
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:38,251
Oh, that's awesome.

889
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:38,960
Get a date.

890
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,879
Don't get a job.

891
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:40,790
Just go get a date.

892
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,300
That's a good idea.

893
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,390
Oh, my goodness.

894
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,885
Not the finger.

895
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,630
Nathan!

896
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,004
Nathan!

897
00:53:50,004 --> 00:53:53,037
Wake up, sleepy head!

898
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,951
We got a lot to do tonight.

899
00:53:56,329 --> 00:53:57,753
I got a date!

900
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,385
Aren't you excited?

901
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:00,670
What are you doing, man?

902
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,409
What are you doing?

903
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,325
I'm loving you.

904
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:04,659
I'm loving every minute of this.

905
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:05,658
Why are you doing this?

906
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:06,550
What did I do to you?

907
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,044
I want you to
sign this head shot.

908
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:09,843
Listen.

909
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:10,820
Listen.

910
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,920
We can talk about this.

911
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:12,890
Yeah, let's
talk about it.

912
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:13,650
We can talk.

913
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,530
Before that
though, sign it.

914
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:17,071
If you're trying
to make something--

915
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,885
Say, to David,
my number one fan--

916
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:19,760
I can't sign!

917
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,465
--I love you.

918
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:20,850
I can't sign!

919
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:21,693
XOXO.

920
00:54:21,693 --> 00:54:22,620
I can't fucking sign!

921
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,835
Sign it!

922
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:28,705
You almost got me!

923
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,468
Oh, my God.

924
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,644
Are you--

925
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,346
You're so
pathetic, Nathan.

926
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,025
Yeah!

927
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:51,776
Listen.

928
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:52,584
Listen.

929
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:53,380
Listen.

930
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,080
Listen.

931
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,484
You're making a movie, right?

932
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:56,620
You're making a movie?

933
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,770
I can fund it.

934
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,020
I can fund your movie.

935
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,325
I'll be in your-- no!

936
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,085
I love you, Nathan.

937
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:49,320
I'd stay and hang out with you,
but I've got some stuff to do.

938
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,520
I'm leaving and
I'm taking the car.

939
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,490
No, you're not.

940
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,525
I have an early shift.

941
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:47,950
You better be back on time!

942
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,890
It's my fucking car!

943
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,160
Grow up!

944
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,740
What are you doing
leaving the door open?

945
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,165
You're letting all
the freaking bugs in.

946
00:56:57,165 --> 00:56:59,590
What's the matter with you?

947
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,135
Do you ever stop bitching?

948
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,390
Hey.

949
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,649
Hey.

950
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,321
Did you already order?

951
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,919
Yeah.

952
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,745
I took a wild guess and I
got you that cup of coffee.

953
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,316
Thanks.

954
00:57:36,726 --> 00:57:38,290
I could use it.

955
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,650
What's going on with your car?

956
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,750
Did you steal that
one from a rich guy?

957
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,808
No, it's mine.

958
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:48,210
I'm just joking.

959
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:52,168
My mom's just always borrowing
it to get to work, you know?

960
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,007
Somehow that just
doesn't seem fair to me.

961
00:57:56,475 --> 00:57:57,930
It's not.

962
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,630
She's driving me crazy.

963
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,193
She started drinking again.

964
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,510
You guys know what you want?

965
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,890
I'm not really hungry.

966
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,292
You sure?

967
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,960
It's on me.

968
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,310
No, it's cool.

969
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,320
Get something.

970
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,360
I think, um, I
think I'll just have

971
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,040
a basket of fries with cheese.

972
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,120
No bacon please.

973
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,030
Cheese.

974
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,172
No pork.

975
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:22,840
All right.

976
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,220
You sure you don't
want anything, honey?

977
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

978
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:25,887
I just ate.

979
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:26,886
Thank you.

980
00:58:31,704 --> 00:58:34,340
So what did you tell
your mom about me?

981
00:58:39,427 --> 00:58:40,870
Not a lot.

982
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:43,000
Just that you were
making a movie

983
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,680
and you want me to be in it.

984
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:51,973
Basically, I just want to focus
on my acting again, you know?

985
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:53,290
Yeah.

986
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,084
She doesn't believe in
that though, does she?

987
00:58:58,514 --> 00:58:59,593
No.

988
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,920
It's like whenever there's
good news or an opportunity

989
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,123
for something, she just never
takes anything I say seriously,

990
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:13,370
you know?

991
00:59:13,785 --> 00:59:15,590
I don't want to
end up like that.

992
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:18,531
No.

993
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,381
I don't think you can.

994
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,733
Where did you say your,
um, mom worked again?

995
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,327
She works at Everybody's.

996
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:33,873
I know, right?

997
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,660
Thank you.

998
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,785
I don't want to sound rude,
but you forgot my cheese again.

999
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,060
Cheese?

1000
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,070
Mhm.

1001
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:46,470
That's what I asked for.

1002
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,260
All right.

1003
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,930
Thank you.

1004
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,914
I just wish
she'd hurry up and move out.

1005
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,516
It's like everything
I say, you know?

1006
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,780
She's so righteous about it.

1007
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,910
It's like she thinks
I'm going to fail

1008
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,080
and she's trying to
save me or whatever.

1009
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,280
I just think she
can't stand to see

1010
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,734
her daughter do
more than she has,

1011
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,500
which isn't even that
much sadly, you know?

1012
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,936
I don't think you have to
worry about your mom anymore.

1013
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,730
She's going to be out of
your life soon, trust me.

1014
01:00:26,058 --> 01:00:27,916
You're going places.

1015
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,199
I wish she'd hurry up an leave.

1016
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,966
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

1017
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,440
Charlotte?

1018
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,904
She's all right, I guess.

1019
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:46,060
I know, we're kind of getting
on each other's nerves

1020
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,501
a little bit.

1021
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,952
Well, I mean, you know?

1022
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:51,600
It's just mother daughter shit.

1023
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,037
Whatever.

1024
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:54,890
OK.

1025
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,760
You know what?

1026
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,192
She's got these guys
that are kind of, um,

1027
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,837
looking at her for
some acting stuff.

1028
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,510
I know!

1029
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:04,280
It would be great.

1030
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,010
I'm so proud of her.

1031
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,538
I mean-- well, it's obvious
where she got the talent from.

1032
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,888
From me.

1033
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,294
God, I mean, don't
you remember--

1034
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:23,180
Before I got knocked up,
everybody used to say,

1035
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,880
you should go to Vegas.

1036
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,550
Yeah, you should be dancing
in one of those shows.

1037
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,666
Me and Jimmy at the Honey Club.

1038
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:34,371
Oh God.

1039
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,070
When we use to dance together.

1040
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,960
We looked so good together.

1041
01:01:44,097 --> 01:01:45,930
I kind of miss those days.

1042
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:54,820
That's so sweet.

1043
01:01:57,377 --> 01:01:59,010
Not as sweet as you, Charlotte.

1044
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,065
I wonder what that feels like.

1045
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:05,996
You'll know.

1046
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,366
You'll know when you feel it.

1047
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:18,072
So when can I see a script?

1048
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,600
I'm still working on it.

1049
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,088
I'm on my last revision now.

1050
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,110
I'm still building it.

1051
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,919
You're gonna like it.

1052
01:02:29,132 --> 01:02:30,560
Well, what's it about?

1053
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,310
Tell me.

1054
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,999
I mean, what kind
of movie is it?

1055
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:41,732
I like to think of it as an
art film, visceral and alive.

1056
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,560
It's raw meat.

1057
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,670
Something that everybody
can connect to and feel.

1058
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,890
It sounds like a masterpiece.

1059
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,214
I'm excited.

1060
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,171
I'm so glad you're excited.

1061
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,540
I run across a
lot of people that

1062
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,280
lack that kind of excitement.

1063
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,960
Do you want to get out of here?

1064
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:09,070
Yeah.

1065
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,270
Where do you want to go?

1066
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,350
Yeah!

1067
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:19,127
You're good.

1068
01:03:19,814 --> 01:03:20,790
Strike.

1069
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,508
You're up.

1070
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:24,750
I haven't done this in awhile.

1071
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:29,810
OK.

1072
01:03:42,806 --> 01:03:43,966
You suck!

1073
01:03:49,446 --> 01:03:50,682
It's all right.

1074
01:03:50,682 --> 01:03:51,948
You get another turn.

1075
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,970
I need one.

1076
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,329
I want to know about you.

1077
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:01,370
What do you want
to know, Charlotte?

1078
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,766
Where are you from?

1079
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:05,693
How'd you start making movies?

1080
01:04:06,165 --> 01:04:08,140
I've been making
movies my whole life.

1081
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,419
But I used to work for
somebody else, writing scripts.

1082
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:19,040
And that didn't work out.

1083
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:21,778
How?

1084
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,830
There was a project
I was working on

1085
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,400
and, uh, they made
a lot of promises.

1086
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:36,537
And?

1087
01:04:36,795 --> 01:04:38,191
And nothing.

1088
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,890
Nothing happened.

1089
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:48,977
They forgot about me
and everybody else

1090
01:04:48,977 --> 01:04:50,552
that helped them.

1091
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,400
Go ahead.

1092
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,430
Bowl for me.

1093
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:54,358
Serious?

1094
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:55,356
Yeah.

1095
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,184
I'm having so much fun.

1096
01:05:00,184 --> 01:05:02,080
I forgot what it
was like to bowl.

1097
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,121
How could they do that?

1098
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:13,100
Easy.

1099
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,785
They just did.

1100
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:17,078
They forgot about me.

1101
01:05:17,505 --> 01:05:19,375
They'd forget about you too.

1102
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,510
Who's they?

1103
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,189
I wouldn't worry about them.

1104
01:05:27,622 --> 01:05:29,530
They're not doing
anything anymore.

1105
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,335
I guess it all
caught up to them.

1106
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,352
You seem pretty
sure about that.

1107
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:44,876
Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,732
I am sure about it.

1109
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,776
And I'm sure about something
else too, Charlotte.

1110
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:52,370
That's why I'm making
my own project.

1111
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,941
You're the one key
piece of talent.

1112
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,010
You are!

1113
01:05:59,010 --> 01:05:59,764
What?

1114
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:01,240
It's going to be beautiful.

1115
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:04,468
Are you ready?

1116
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:05,717
Yeah.

1117
01:06:05,989 --> 01:06:07,905
I'm gonna roll a good
one for you, Charlotte.

1118
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:08,610
OK.

1119
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:09,320
You ready?

1120
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,029
Yeah.

1121
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,068
Yeah!

1122
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:21,970
Yeah!

1123
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,582
Did you see that?

1124
01:06:26,628 --> 01:06:27,826
It was beautiful.

1125
01:06:27,826 --> 01:06:29,337
I saw.

1126
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,971
Just like you.

1127
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,960
Did I tell you that before,
that you're beautiful?

1128
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:51,004
All right, I'm off to
make the big dollars for you.

1129
01:10:51,004 --> 01:10:52,927
I'll see you around 11:00.

1130
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:05,961
Like a fucking teenager.

1131
01:16:29,926 --> 01:16:31,676
Shh.

1132
01:16:58,023 --> 01:16:58,823
Help!

1133
01:17:11,516 --> 01:17:12,546
Let me out!

1134
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:25,900
Let me out!

1135
01:22:11,922 --> 01:22:13,356
Let me go!

1136
01:22:13,356 --> 01:22:14,350
Let me go!

1137
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:15,992
Please, let me go!

1138
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:17,292
Please!

1139
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:21,228
Let me go!

1140
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,786
What are you doing to me?

1141
01:22:32,171 --> 01:22:33,470
Mom?

1142
01:22:34,433 --> 01:22:37,014
Why are you doing this?

1143
01:22:37,014 --> 01:22:37,884
Mom?

1144
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:42,949
Mom?

1145
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:45,466
Don't you come near me!

1146
01:23:00,745 --> 01:23:02,410
Mom, where are you?

1147
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:05,630
Mom?

1148
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,270
Charlotte!

1149
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:29,302
I was surrounded by
negativity for so long,

1150
01:23:29,302 --> 01:23:32,079
I became blind to what I had.

1151
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:33,620
What are you doing?

1152
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:35,670
What are you doing?

1153
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,220
I'm making magic!

1154
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,605
But after seeing you, I knew
what I was doing was right.

1155
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,935
Come on, Mary.

1156
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:53,055
Talk to me.

1157
01:23:53,055 --> 01:23:54,370
Talk to me!

1158
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,929
I don't know what you want.

1159
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:57,325
You know what I want.

1160
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:00,440
I want you to tell me the truth
for once in your fucking life.

1161
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:04,554
I want you to understand
that your appearance is corruption.

1162
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:10,092
By showing it to you,
showing you what not to be.

1163
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,415
It really is all about you now.

1164
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:13,763
Not them.

1165
01:24:13,763 --> 01:24:15,364
You're so beautiful.

1166
01:24:18,799 --> 01:24:19,774
Fuck you!

1167
01:24:19,774 --> 01:24:21,204
Fuck you!

1168
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:24,394
You want some of that?

1169
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:26,491
I know you do.

1170
01:24:27,241 --> 01:24:28,606
You were right.

1171
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:31,896
No, no, no, no.

1172
01:24:31,896 --> 01:24:33,327
Please, no!

1173
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:35,510
You should think
about your daughter.

1174
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:36,330
Right?

1175
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,083
We're in another situation
where you're just

1176
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,610
talking about yourself.

1177
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:41,130
Fuck Charlotte, OK?

1178
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:43,649
Is that what you want?

1179
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,370
You're right.

1180
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:46,560
I hate her.

1181
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,180
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1182
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:49,160
Is that it?

1183
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,860
Because now you've got it, OK?

1184
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,860
Can I please leave?

1185
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,360
She ruined my life.

1186
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,160
I was going to have a career.

1187
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,020
Not her.

1188
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,187
Me!

1189
01:24:58,187 --> 01:24:59,825
So you're saying
that your life is

1190
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:01,582
more important than hers?

1191
01:25:01,582 --> 01:25:05,834
I-- I had something really
special and then she fucking

1192
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,656
came along and I
couldn't do anything.

1193
01:25:14,469 --> 01:25:18,366
I think I might believe you
because I'm almost gonna cry.

1194
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:20,051
Because you're so fucking--

1195
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:35,928
They were just the
tools, the pieces I needed

1196
01:25:36,419 --> 01:25:38,910
in this greater creation.

1197
01:25:38,910 --> 01:25:40,877
This rebirth.

1198
01:25:41,395 --> 01:25:42,829
Your rebirth.

1199
01:25:57,781 --> 01:25:59,060
Charlotte!

1200
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,700
The first time I saw you
I knew you were special.

1201
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:06,975
You're the one.

1202
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,428
She's gone!

1203
01:26:09,428 --> 01:26:11,064
She didn't love you!

1204
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:13,358
I love you, Charlotte!

1205
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:19,822
I gave you what you wanted.

1206
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:23,661
You can be whoever
you want to be.

1207
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,390
I created all this
for you, Charlotte.

1208
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:32,632
It's always been about you.

1209
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,770
You're free!

1210
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,358
You're free.

1211
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:38,877
You can do whatever you want.

1212
01:26:38,877 --> 01:26:39,940
You can be whoever--

1213
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:42,516
No!

1214
01:26:42,516 --> 01:26:43,300
No!

1215
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,738
I want you to like it!

1216
01:26:44,738 --> 01:26:46,360
I want you to like it!

1217
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,133
I want you to like it!

1218
01:26:48,133 --> 01:26:49,816
No!

1219
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:32,712
I would recommend
at this point walk away.

1220
01:28:32,712 --> 01:28:36,189
You've had your share of
lies and hurt and venom

1221
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:40,995
that I've saved in
my cold blue veins.

1222
01:28:42,509 --> 01:28:46,031
Bumping with fear and pain.

1223
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:54,824
I'm not sure exactly how
it's easy trusting you.

1224
01:28:54,824 --> 01:28:58,600
Hung out and manipulated,
I've called myself

1225
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,224
a fool again and again.

1226
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:08,022
One damn foolish man.

1227
01:29:10,838 --> 01:29:15,757
The tragedy has ended.

1228
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:21,243
The angel has ascended

1229
01:29:21,243 --> 01:29:25,518
from the pedestal I put her on.

1230
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:32,470
When you awake, I will be gone.

1231
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:37,037
Charlotte, Charlotte, It's true.

1232
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:43,194
My love, this is just for you.

1233
01:29:43,194 --> 01:29:48,116
Charlotte, Charlotte, it's true.

1234
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:53,918
You are now free to pursue.

1235
01:29:54,706 --> 01:29:57,412
The years the clock
has spun, I've

1236
01:29:57,412 --> 01:30:02,584
questioned long and hard
motives that may be driving me

1237
01:30:02,584 --> 01:30:08,386
and will they leave you
scarred as I start to see?

1238
01:30:09,836 --> 01:30:13,354
Pieces of you and me.

1239
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:18,936
So step up to the plate.

1240
01:30:18,936 --> 01:30:21,788
Let's see what you can take.

1241
01:30:21,788 --> 01:30:24,776
I built these walls
around my heart

1242
01:30:24,776 --> 01:30:29,944
to block out all the pain,
but you broke right through.

1243
01:30:31,748 --> 01:30:35,416
There's something good in you.

1244
01:30:37,982 --> 01:30:42,509
The broken is now mended.

1245
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,825
And I never intended for you

1246
01:30:48,825 --> 01:30:52,920
to fall face first into my arms.

1247
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,766
I promise I will help.

1248
01:30:56,766 --> 01:30:59,636
I will do no harm.

1249
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:04,284
You've showed me that your pure heart

1250
01:31:04,984 --> 01:31:09,892
can offer us a new start.

1251
01:31:09,892 --> 01:31:14,090
Yeah, I'm living
and letting it grow.

1252
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:21,050
And I just wanted
for you to know

1253
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:26,253
in my own weird way I love you.

1254
01:31:26,932 --> 01:31:34,186
My damaged soul feels
rescued from a sea of lies

1255
01:31:34,186 --> 01:31:36,245
and of regrets.

1256
01:31:36,986 --> 01:31:42,552
So let's turn the page
and see what happens next.

1257
01:31:43,816 --> 01:31:47,326
The tragedy has ended.

1258
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,128
Oh Charlotte.

1259
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:53,288
The angel has ascended.

1260
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,430
Hey, yo.

1261
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,780
Hey, yo.

1262
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,910
I think we all get a
little crazy sometimes.

1263
01:32:14,636 --> 01:32:16,880
I think we all get
a little David Long.

1264
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,300
I'm David Long He's David Long.

1265
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:20,550
She's David Long.

1266
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:22,040
We're all David Long.

1267
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,240
I'm David Long.

1268
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,480
He's David Long.

1269
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,635
She's David Long.

1270
01:32:25,635 --> 01:32:26,900
We're all David Long.

1271
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:27,610
David Long.

1272
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:28,310
Keep the guns.

1273
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,240
Give me the knives
and the gasoline.

1274
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,120
A car battery, box
cutter, and a casket.

1275
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,100
Like Michael Myers and
remake all of his action

1276
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,995
scenes, and walk around
with a lumberjack

1277
01:32:36,995 --> 01:32:38,280
axe and my baggy jeans.

1278
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,680
You aint' half as mean.

1279
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,200
You  as Queen.

1280
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:41,910
What?

1281
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,888
You ain't get the memo
through your fax machine

1282
01:32:43,888 --> 01:32:46,528
that I was coming to phase
you out like a track machine?

1283
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:47,976
I'm trapped in dreams.

1284
01:32:47,976 --> 01:32:49,250
When we slash, they bleed.

1285
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,930
Look them in the eye and ask
them do they have to scream?

1286
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:54,283
I'm a savage wreaking havoc
in the blackest deeds.

1287
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:57,010
But if you haven't, you can
splatter like a flower screen.

1288
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:59,530
Like the ring boy coming
through your plasma screen.

1289
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,350
Don't make me drown you in your
tub until your ass is clean.

1290
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,425
I'm  so watch
what you asking me.

1291
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:06,846
I bet it's hard to talk shit
when you're lacking teeth.

1292
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:07,975
Take your leave.

1293
01:33:07,975 --> 01:33:09,600
No pressure, all
stress relieved.

1294
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,920
See, basically, there's a
David Long in all of us.

1295
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,692
And locked inside, there's a
David Long that follows us.

1296
01:33:15,692 --> 01:33:17,830
Wherever we go,
he's going there to follow us.

1297
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:20,100
Release the crazy things
that we keep bottled up

1298
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,075
with David Long.

1299
01:33:21,075 --> 01:33:21,930
I'm David Long.

1300
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:22,860
He's David Long.

1301
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:23,960
She's David Long.

1302
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,920
We're all David Long.

1303
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,390
I'm David Long.

1304
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:28,700
He's David Long.

1305
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:29,939
She's David Long.

1306
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:30,954
We're all David Long.

1307
01:33:30,954 --> 01:33:31,734
David Long.

1308
01:33:31,734 --> 01:33:34,250
Give me five or pump
three for my chainsaw.

1309
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,190
It's called a chainsaw,
but I call it my pain saw.

1310
01:33:37,190 --> 01:33:39,770
I have you leaking different
colors like crayons.

1311
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,390
Do the job and leave,
like I just got laid off.

1312
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:44,966
You think you got me figured
out, but you're way off.

1313
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:47,660
You can't control me like a
game when it's turned off.

1314
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,010
You go soft.

1315
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,885
I go.

1316
01:33:49,885 --> 01:33:53,499
Catch them with a bullet and
hit them in the.

1317
01:33:53,499 --> 01:33:55,500
Me cleaver, chop your
fat off like a cigar.

1318
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,228
These are stars I
throw like ninja.

1319
01:33:57,228 --> 01:34:00,390
You can run all you want, but
I promise you won't get far.

1320
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:02,030
You're a pussy
like a your sister.

1321
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:03,571
I'll hit you til you see stars.

1322
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:06,120
And now you can barely stand,
but I'm the fucking retard?

1323
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,620
You're probably gonna need arms,
but your hands are tied up.

1324
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,360
And I'm gonna dump you where
them garbage cans line up

1325
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:11,470
and leave you there.

1326
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:13,594
They smell you
before they ride up.

1327
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:14,979
David Long.

1328
01:34:14,979 --> 01:34:17,014
Basically, there's a
David Long in all of us.

1329
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:19,514
And locked inside, there's a
David Long that follows us.

1330
01:34:19,514 --> 01:34:21,721
Wherever we go,
he's going there to follow us.

1331
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:24,020
Release the crazy things
that we keep bottled up

1332
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:24,826
with David Long.

1333
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:25,660
I'm David Long.

1334
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,710
He's David Long.

1335
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,060
She's David Long.

1336
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,260
We're all David Long.

1337
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:30,160
I'm David Long.

1338
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,960
He's David Long.

1339
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,160
She's David Long.

1340
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,440
We're all David Long.

1341
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,110
David Long.
