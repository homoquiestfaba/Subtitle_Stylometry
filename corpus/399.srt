1
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Chris, what is it?

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,000
I love you so much.

3
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,440
Don't you love me any more?

4
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,160
I've made progress,
and I recognise that.

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,000
But my wife, who I can't
even convince to come here...

6
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,800
Anything can set her off.
It could be the phone ringing,

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,000
something on the news,
something online, going shopping maybe.

8
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
A commemorative T-shirt in the window.
It just puts her right back in that place,

9
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,880
and it's like all my progress - ripped away.
And I'm right back there with her.

10
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,200
I feel totally the opposite. I see the TV
and I see the Internet and I see those T-shirts

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,440
and I feel nothing. The more I see the images,
the less I feel, the less I believe that it's real.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,680
I mean, I think I'm supposed to feel
something by now. Don't you think so?

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,080
Linda, this is Chris Kelvin.
I'm returning your call.

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,240
I have two times available this week;

15
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,280
7am on Tuesday
or 6.15pm on Thursday.

16
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,040
You can leave a message if either
of those times are good for you. Thank you.

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,840
Well, I know that's not true.

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,760
Because I know you, and I know it's not true.

19
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,600
Good. I'm glad.

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,480
All right.

21
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,680
Let's pick this up on Wednesday.

22
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,360
Can I help you?

23
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,880
<i>We're looking for Dr Chris Kelvin.</i>

24
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,920
<i>Chris...</i>

25
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,920
<i>I can't imagine what you must be
thinking, getting a message like this.</i>

26
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,880
<i>I apologise if it seems melodramatic, but
you are the only person I can... I can trust...</i>

27
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,360
<i>in the situation.</i>

28
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
<i>I need your help.</i>

29
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,760
<i>I need you to come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,800
<i>I don't know how to describe
what we are experiencing up here.</i>

31
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,280
<i>We can't even agree amongst ourselves
what is... what is happening, or...</i>

32
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
<i>what to do about it.</i>

33
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,880
<i>I suppose the... the most obvious
solution would be to leave.</i>

34
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,720
<i>But none of us want to. That's why
you're getting this... this bizarre request.</i>

35
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,760
<i>I...</i>

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,800
<i>I told the crew that your
background and experiences</i>

37
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>made you the...
the ideal candidate for this job.</i>

38
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
<i>Don't worry. I didn't elaborate.</i>

39
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,960
<i>But it's true.</i>

40
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,680
<i>So, anyway...</i>

41
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,440
<i>I, uh... I hope you will come to Solaris, Chris.</i>

42
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,280
<i>L- I think you need to.</i>

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,680
<i>You will see what I mean.</i>

44
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>I wish I could be more specific
about all of this, but... you know.</i>

45
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,280
<i>People are listening.</i>

46
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,800
You can imagine the distress
Dr Gibarian's message caused at DBA.

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,200
Why not send in the security force?

48
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,880
We did. We lost contact
as they were approaching Solaris.

49
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,600
They haven't returned.

50
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,600
There must be some
sort of on-board Al system.

51
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,640
They shut it down.

52
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,000
The company was hoping to solve
this problem without involving a civilian.

53
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,560
Obviously these are extreme circumstances.

54
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,400
Some preparation is involved
but you shouldn't have any trouble.

55
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,920
The flight itself is fully automated.
You'll be asleep most of the trip.

56
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,840
We feel confident that if you board
the ship, you can negotiate their safe return.

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
Is that what everybody wants?

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,160
Of course.

59
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Find the probability of F.

60
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,880
OK, stop. Go back.

61
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,920
Snow.

62
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,960
Kelvin, is it?

63
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,880
Yeah.

64
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,840
Kelvin. Right. Oh, man.

65
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,360
Sorry about that, Kelvin.

66
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Names, you know, just...

67
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,960
For some reason. It, uh...

68
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah. Uh...

69
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,880
Well, uh, you wanna come in?

70
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm fine.

71
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,360
Whose blood is that, leading to the lab?

72
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah. Blood.

73
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,480
How 'bout that?

74
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,400
Katarn.

75
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,520
He, um... Yeah.

76
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,680
Security forces showed up
and he just took off, and they...

77
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,160
Yeah. Put a hole in his pot.

78
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,160
What happened to Gibarian?

79
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,120
Yeah.

80
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,160
It was a suicide.

81
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
Who found him?

82
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,040
I found him.

83
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,400
What happened to Rhys?

84
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah, now, Rhys w... Huh.

85
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,440
We don't know, because the thing is,
he kind of... disappeared.

86
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,440
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.

87
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,160
- How did he disappear?
- Exactly.

88
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,720
Don't know. We do know
that he's not on the ship, uh,

89
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,120
and that's... that's all we know.

90
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,720
Where's Dr Gordon?

91
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,440
Dr Gordon. She is in her room,

92
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
and, um...

93
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,880
Dr Gordon won't let you in her room.

94
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,440
Can you tell me what's happening here?

95
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,240
I could tell you what's happening,

96
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
but, uh...

97
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't know if that'd
really tell you what's happening.

98
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I just wanna talk to you.

99
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,280
You have to give me your word
you won't try to come in.

100
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,600
All right.

101
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,160
Well?

102
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,120
- What happened to Gibarian?
- Didn't you talk to Snow?

103
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,640
- I wanted to hear your version.
- There isn't any version.

104
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,640
He killed himself.

105
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Why haven't you come home?
What happened here?

106
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,600
What did you find?

107
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,640
- Who are you representing?
- I'm the last effort to recover this mission,

108
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,560
before they abandon this ship
and everyone on board.

109
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,160
Until it starts happening to you,
there's really no point in discussing it.

110
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,120
Hey.

111
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,360
Hey!

112
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,080
<i>- Who else is here?
- Who else is here?</i>

113
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,800
<i>I saw a boy.</i>

114
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,520
Gibarian's son.

115
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,200
- Michael.
- How is that possible?

116
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,480
I think that's why you're here.

117
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
I want a formal interview with you
and Gordon. I'll need your help with her.

118
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,920
Yeah. All right.

119
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,200
Um...

120
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,680
How much sleep do you need, Kelvin?

121
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,320
- How much sleep?
- Yeah.

122
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,240
- How long can you go without sleep?
- Depends.

123
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,360
Well,

124
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,840
when you do go to sleep,

125
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,040
I find I sleep much better
with the door locked.

126
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,880
<i>I was with the project when it was
still with NASA, before it was sold to DBA.</i>

127
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,080
I was trained in physics.

128
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,760
I was sent here to assess
the economic potential of Solaris.

129
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Whether or not it was a viable commercial
property or possible energy source.

130
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,960
I was still compiling data
when this shit started happening.

131
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,880
Did you run any tests
on the food, air, water?

132
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,720
I checked it 50 times. There are no signs of
contaminants or psychotropic compounds.

133
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,800
How about you? How are you doing?

134
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,480
Depression.

135
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,320
Along with bouts of hypomania
and primary insomnia.

136
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,200
Suggestions of agoraphobia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder,

137
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,480
shock, fatigue, denial...

138
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,440
- Not unusual, given the circumstances.
- I know.

139
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,560
All right. Now, what can you tell me
about what's happening here?

140
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,080
Just that I want it to stop,
but I want to stop it.

141
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,600
If I can stop it that means
I'm smarter than it is.

142
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,520
You know you can go home,
walk away from all of this.

143
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,640
I can guarantee it.

144
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah.

145
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,040
The thing is... Man, I would kill
to go back there. I'd... kill.

146
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,720
But Gordon?

147
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,640
Gordon happens to be Gordon, you know?

148
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,320
So, um...

149
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,360
But I'll see what I can do.

150
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,880
<i>We take off into the cosmos.</i>

151
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,240
<i>Ready for anything -
solitude, hardship, exhaustion...</i>

152
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,560
<i>death.</i>

153
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,720
<i>We're proud of ourselves.</i>

154
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,440
<i>But when you think about it,
our enthusiasm's a sham.</i>

155
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,240
<i>We don't want other worlds. We want mirrors.</i>

156
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,040
So, anyway... How's the spawn?

157
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh, good, good. He cries
and shits in his pants every two hours.

158
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,400
I know the feeling.

159
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,520
When are you leaving?

160
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
- We've been postponed again.
- I didn't hear that.

161
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,160
Nobody knows yet.

162
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,600
The governments are looking for a buyer. I
wish we could tell people what's happening.

163
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,960
You can tell me. I'm a doctor.

164
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, Doctor, as we study Solaris,

165
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,200
the most interesting thing is it, um...

166
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,960
Well, it seems to be reacting.
Almost like it knows it's being observed.

167
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
We can't explain it.

168
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Are you listening to me? Chris?

169
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,880
- So anyway...
- So anyway. Sorry.

170
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,080
Go to her. Her name is Rheya. She's a bit
tricky but, um, I guess she's worthwhile.

171
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,280
Maybe she needs a shrink.

172
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,920
Don't we all?

173
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,600
Don't blow it.

174
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,960
<i>You start.</i>

175
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
<i>I did.</i>

176
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,000
<i>Really?</i>

177
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,320
All right, I'm gonna resist the impulse
to ask you about the door knob.

178
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,720
- Do you always resist your impulses?
- Not always.

179
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,440
<i>Try poetry.</i>

180
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,640
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

181
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,480
<i>Mm. Thomas.</i>

182
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,000
<i>It's not a very happy poem, though.</i>

183
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,560
<i>Well, you didn't seem
very happy when I saw you on the train.</i>

184
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,960
<i>I wasn't.</i>

185
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,680
<i>And tonight?</i>

186
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,320
<i>It's early.</i>

187
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,280
Goddammit!

188
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm awake.

189
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,280
Yes.

190
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,600
How are you here?

191
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,880
How are you here?

192
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
How do you mean?

193
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,240
Where do you think you are?
Where do you think you are right now?

194
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,720
At home.

195
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,840
Where is home?

196
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,280
With you, where we live.

197
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,400
And do you remember being anywhere else
with me? Being together anywhere else?

198
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,120
- Our apartment.
- Describe it.

199
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,040
It's dark. It's very very dark.

200
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,200
And there are no paintings on the wall.

201
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
No pictures anywhere.

202
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,400
No pictures on the fridge, even,
which I always thought was a bit strange.

203
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,880
Do you remember
where we first saw each other?

204
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,600
On a train.

205
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,760
Chris...

206
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm so happy to see you.

207
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,280
I love you so much.

208
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,960
Don't you love me any more?

209
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,320
I have to check out something with the crew.

210
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,120
No! No!

211
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,320
- Don't leave me! Don't leave me!
- Why? Why?

212
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,040
- Why?
- I don't know.

213
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,000
I don't know.

214
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
It's OK.

215
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,640
It's OK.

216
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,760
Why are you sitting over there?

217
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,320
Can I come and sit with you?

218
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,120
Hey.

219
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,000
What was that?

220
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,440
Yeah.

221
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,880
How 'bout that?

222
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,920
Still workin' on that.

223
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,360
Where's your visitor?

224
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,080
I don't know. Stopped appearing.

225
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,080
- Who's your visitor?
- My brother.

226
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Who was it?

227
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,200
My wife.

228
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,160
Dead?

229
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,160
So what was her name?

230
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,760
Will she come back?

231
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,560
Do you want her to?

232
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,840
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

233
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,000
- No, it isn't. It's crap.
- Only one way to find out.

234
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,400
You can submit it to someone
and see if they publish it.

235
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,840
That's not an indication of anything.

236
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,600
So no one else's opinion counts
except for yours?

237
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,080
- Yeah.
- That's insane.

238
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,520
- "That's" insane.
- I like it.

239
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,040
Brings out the red in my eyes.

240
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,520
So, did you show it to your father?

241
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,400
- Yeah.
- And?

242
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,000
- And he liked it.
- What'd he say?

243
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,200
- He said he liked it.
- Well...

244
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,040
He's a man who doesn't pass out
compliments very easily. That's something.

245
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,800
- What's that tell you?
- Can we talk about something else? Please?

246
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,320
All right. When do you wanna get hitched?

247
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,480
Every time I bring it up
you make a joke about it, and...

248
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,800
I know, I know. That's pathet...
I'm sorry. It's just...

249
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,920
It-it's so difficult for me.

250
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,640
Still? Is it something that I'm not doing?

251
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,800
No. No, no, no. That's not the issue at all.

252
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,720
Because, you know,
if you keep putting this off,

253
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,960
then in 15 or 20 years
I'm just gonna stop asking.

254
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,320
- Well, I've got ages, then.
- Mm.

255
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,400
So apart from the poem that you
quoted to me the night that we met...

256
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,600
The night that you were hitting on me.

257
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,800
Oh, I don't think so.
What's your favourite poem?

258
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,480
My favourite Dylan Thomas poem?
Well, there's the, uh...

259
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,080
Listen to this. We have, uh... There's the...

260
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,680
Well, there's the one he's most famous for,

261
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,040
which starts, um...

262
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,600
- "There was a young man from Nantucket..."
- I knew it. I just...

263
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm not marrying you.

264
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,320
You...

265
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,760
Oh, you're marrying me.

266
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
Would we have to invite anyone else?

267
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,360
There should be witnesses.

268
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,200
Otherwise nobody'd believe us.

269
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,000
<i>When I was little I had
this imaginary friend called Mikashelli,</i>

270
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,960
who used to live under the wallpaper
in the corner of the room.

271
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,040
I used to go and visit. I had a very
intense relationship. I was an only child.

272
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
As you know. And, um...
that was like my sibling.

273
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,360
That was the person I used to have
battles with and fights with and everything.

274
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,560
What happened progressively
over the next few years

275
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,320
is that my mother stopped
communicating with me.

276
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,680
She only communicated with me as
Mikashelli, and wrote me these letters,

277
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,040
and we didn't have conversations any more.

278
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,240
- I mean, admittedly, she was certifiable.
- Mm-hm.

279
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,440
But, um, yeah, that was
a strange way to grow up.

280
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,000
You know, you're with the right man.

281
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,040
I so know that. That's what's great.

282
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,760
Cos, man...

283
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
Rheya...

284
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,560
It's me.

285
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,280
It's me.

286
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,600
I don't remember that.

287
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,920
When did you get that?

288
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,160
I got it just before I came here.

289
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,360
- Was I with you?
- No.

290
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't actually remember anything.

291
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,840
I only remember you.

292
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,040
Have I been ill?

293
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,840
Sort of.

294
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,600
And we've been apart?

295
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,520
- Yes.
- For how long?

296
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,440
A few years.

297
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,640
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

298
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,760
Was that difficult?

299
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,040
It was easier than being with someone else.

300
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,960
Did you think about me?

301
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,480
Yes.

302
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,760
What is that, out there?

303
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,720
Solaris.

304
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
Oh, my God, yes.

305
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,600
I can't remember how I got here.

306
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,920
Did I come here with you?

307
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,440
- I don't know how you got here.
- What do you mean?

308
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,240
I woke up and you were here.

309
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,160
So I wasn't here yesterday?

310
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,280
No.

311
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,840
Right.

312
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,480
<i>Getting dressed?</i>

313
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,840
People will notice tonight.

314
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,400
If you're not there, Rheya,

315
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,280
people will notice.

316
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,760
I can put up with all of it,
you know? The mood swings, the...

317
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,640
restlessness,

318
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,560
<i>changing jobs every three months, all of it.</i>

319
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,880
<i>What I can't put up with
is you hiding from me.</i>

320
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,920
Why do you do that?

321
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,040
Do you wanna be here?

322
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,520
Cos I need help. I can't do this...
I can't "continue" to do this on my own.

323
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,800
<i>The idea of God
was dreamed up by man.</i>

324
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,200
<i>A silly animal with a small brain.</i>

325
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,480
<i>Even the limits
that we put on it are human limits.</i>

326
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,280
- It designs, it creates...
- No, I'm talking about a higher intelligence.

327
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,520
No, hold it. You're talking about
something else - a man in a white beard.

328
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
Ascribing human characteristics
to something that isn't human.

329
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Aren't we all?

330
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,840
Rheya, given all the elements
of the known universe and enough time,

331
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,240
our existence is inevitable.

332
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,880
It's no more mysterious than trees or sharks.

333
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,120
We're a mathematical probability,
and that's all.

334
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,040
How do you explain that
of all the creatures on this planet,

335
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
only we are conscious of our own mortality?

336
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,120
You can't explain that.
That doesn't mean there's a God.

337
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,760
Maybe religion has been bred into us.

338
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The pope is a wonderful woman...

339
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,120
- Excuse me.
- A nihilistic shrink. Is there a school?

340
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,280
Not yet.

341
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,360
You see? He's funny, at least.

342
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,280
Where you been?

343
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,600
Away from those fucking people.

344
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,160
<i>They're my friends.</i>

345
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,280
<i>Yeah.</i>

346
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,240
Chris, I've got to talk to you.

347
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,440
What's wrong?

348
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,320
I don't understand what's happening.

349
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,560
And if I do understand what's happening
then I don't think I can handle it.

350
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,880
What do you mean?

351
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,560
I mean...

352
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,520
I mean...

353
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,800
I'm not the person I remember.

354
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,240
Or at least I'm not sure I am.

355
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,960
I mean, l-I do remember things,
but I don't remember being there.

356
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,720
I don't remember experiencing those things.

357
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,200
My... I...

358
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,760
I mean, I'm really really...

359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,400
really really trying to understand.

360
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,440
And-and these, uh...

361
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,840
These... these strange thoughts
keep coming into my head, and I...

362
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,400
I don't know where they're
coming from, and I'm scared.

363
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,760
Um...

364
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,080
And l-I don't know what's happening.
L-I don't know what's happening.

365
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,800
- What do you think's happening?
- You need rest.

366
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,560
- No...
- Take that.

367
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
You don't understand. Because
I don't think that I can live with this.

368
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,120
I don't understand what is happening now.

369
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:17,280
I mean, this-this-this... I remember this.
I have a memory of it. But...

370
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,400
<i>But I don't. I don't remember
seeing it. I don't...</i>

371
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,000
I don't remember being there. I...

372
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,840
Rheya, it's fatigue. It's fatigue.
It's brought on by stress.

373
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,440
It's fatigue. That's why you take this.

374
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,400
Right. Yeah.

375
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,320
No, it is. You'll be fine. I'll talk to Gordon
and Snow. We'll go back to Earth.

376
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
- Mm-hm.
- And you're gonna be fine.

377
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,120
Mm-hm.

378
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,280
Mm.

379
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,760
- I'm coming right back.
- Right.

380
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,680
- Are you gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

381
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,200
Yeah.

382
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,880
This door locks from the inside.

383
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,680
- Yeah.
- You'll be perfectly safe in here.

384
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,360
Yeah.

385
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,000
You sure you're gonna be all right?

386
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,280
You-you keep asking me that,
actually. Yes. Yeah.

387
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,320
I'm fine. I'm fine.

388
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,440
Stay here.

389
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,560
<i>I was so worried, man.</i>

390
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,760
About this guy. But then you show up,
and I'm even more-more worried about you.

391
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,160
Particularly after the first...
when you sent the first one away.

392
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,360
Yeah, you were pretty...

393
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,120
Pretty, uh... You deserved to be
as freaked out as you were.

394
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:07,000
She can never know anything
about that. Ever. You understand?

395
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,920
No, no, no, no, no.

396
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,240
I wonder if they can get pregnant.

397
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,960
<i>Where are you going?</i>

398
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,600
<i>- I can't be here.
- What?</i>

399
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,760
<i>You should have told me.</i>

400
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,120
- It wouldn't have made any difference.
- Really?

401
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,600
Chris, I had to!

402
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,720
Obviously I had to. You know that about me.

403
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,160
I had no idea you'd react like this. Listen!

404
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Listen to me.

405
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,520
<i>What's changed?
I didn't even know you wanted one.</i>

406
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,120
Yeah, why would I want one?
Why would I want a child,

407
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,640
or anything that would
bring life into this house?!

408
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,920
- No, no, Chris. No. No.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

409
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,800
Stop it! Stop it!

410
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,400
No, Chris, you don't understand.

411
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,960
You have to understand. I had no idea you
felt like that. I won't make it without you.

412
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,680
- Then you won't make it.
- Chris, no, please!

413
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,080
- Let go of me!
- No...

414
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,760
No!

415
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,480
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

416
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,400
<i>Oh, no.</i>

417
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
You wanna change Gordon's mind.
What if Gordon and your wife, right,

418
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,120
your very nice wife... She's nice, right?
Of course she's nice. Your wife is nice.

419
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:36,080
They get together, right?
Cos I'm thinkin'... women, right?

420
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,920
Right now we got woman and woman, right?

421
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,240
If we get "women", you know, together on the
same team and all that shit, what happens?

422
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,920
You know what happens.
All kinds of shit you can't explain happens.

423
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,320
Like the... But good shit, you know?

424
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,400
Mysterious, but good. Usually very good.
Things get solved, you know?

425
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,720
That's my plan, you know?
What do you... think?

426
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,800
I'll have to think about that.

427
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,800
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

428
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,760
<i>"Dead men naked, they shall be one</i>

429
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,640
<i>With the man in the wind
and the west moon. "</i>

430
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,200
<i>"When their bones are picked clean
and the clean bones gone,</i>

431
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,800
<i>They shall have stars at elbow and foot. "</i>

432
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,240
<i>"Though they go mad they shall be sane."</i>

433
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
<i>"Though they sink through the sea
they shall rise again. "</i>

434
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,520
<i>"Though lovers be lost love shall not."</i>

435
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,200
<i>"And death shall have no dominion."</i>

436
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,520
You found me.

437
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,560
I came back for you.

438
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,880
I came back that day.

439
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm sorry.

440
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,680
<i>All right. Enough hypothesising.</i>

441
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,520
The visitors. Are they or are they not
made of subatomic particles?

442
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,680
Subatomic particles... I'm not sure.

443
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,760
What do you think?

444
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,160
I think... probably.

445
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,240
Stabilised by what?

446
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,440
Guess.

447
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,760
I don't know. Maybe... a Higgs field.

448
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,520
So...

449
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,560
if we created a negative Higgs field and
bombarded them with Higgs antibosons

450
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,960
they might disintegrate?

451
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,480
Maybe. You know,
it would take a lot of power.

452
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,680
Shut down all
the noncritical ship functions.

453
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,200
This is just a theory,
you know? We could be wrong.

454
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,240
- Let's find out.
- We'll take the findings back to Earth.

455
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,120
What if they follow us back?

456
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,800
What if what's happening here
happened on Earth on a mass scale?

457
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,200
Don't you see that as a problem?

458
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,080
I think it's a serious mistake
to assume it's benign.

459
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,280
It's driving us crazy
so it can watch us kill each other.

460
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,080
Is that really why you think they're here?

461
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,640
Given its resources it could have
done anything, including destroy us.

462
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,680
Meet me in the lab in an hour.

463
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,760
- I won't let you.
- How you gonna stop us?

464
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,800
- How you gonna stop me taking her back?
- Shall we pick up the other one on the way?

465
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,480
Shouldn't be too hard. We could
chart its course. Only take a day or so.

466
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,160
Chris, what's she talking about?

467
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,600
- Nothing.
- Her oxygen might have run out.

468
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,120
Maybe they don't need any.

469
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,440
Chris, what are they talking about?

470
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,600
You didn't tell her?

471
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,960
Tell me what?

472
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,040
Tell me what?

473
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,920
- You came before.
- He got rid of you.

474
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,160
You what?

475
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,880
I sent you away.

476
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,200
Into space.

477
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,720
Oh, my God.

478
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,040
Oh, my God.

479
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,720
No. Rheya...

480
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
Don't touch me.

481
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,680
Rheya, I didn't understand.

482
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,840
Rheya. Rheya. Hey.

483
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,040
- Don't.
- No. No. No. Don't.

484
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,560
What were you trying to
accomplish with that, exactly?

485
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,160
Kelvin...

486
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,560
It is a mistake to become
emotionally engaged with one of them.

487
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,280
You're being manipulated.

488
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,880
If she were ugly, you wouldn't want her
around. That's why she's not ugly.

489
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,720
She's a mirror that reflects part
of your mind. You provide the formula.

490
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,640
- She's alive.
- She is not human.

491
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,600
Try to understand that,
if you can understand anything.

492
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:59,360
What about your visitor? The one you're
so ready to destroy without hesitation?

493
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,680
Who is it? "What" is it?

494
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,800
Does it feel? Can it touch?

495
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,720
Does it speak?

496
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,520
We are in a situation
that is beyond morality. Hm?

497
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,280
Your wife is dead.

498
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,800
How do you know? How can you be definitive
about a construct you do not understand?

499
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,600
She's a copy. A facsimile.

500
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,040
And she's seducing you all over again.

501
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,920
You're sick.

502
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,360
We are not taking her back with us.

503
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,560
Leave the light off.

504
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,520
You think you're dreaming me.

505
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,680
You're not Gibarian.

506
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,480
No?

507
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,760
Who am I, then?

508
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,640
- A puppet.
- And you're not?

509
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,200
Well, maybe you're my puppet.

510
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,040
But like all puppets,
you think you're actually human.

511
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,760
That's the puppet's dream - being human.

512
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
Why did you kill yourself?

513
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,360
It seemed like a good idea
at the time. Now I think I made a mistake.

514
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,840
- What about your son?
- That's not my son. My son is on Earth.

515
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:54,360
And that's not your wife.
They are part of Solaris. Remember that.

516
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,480
What does Solaris want from us?

517
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,000
Why do you think it has to want something?

518
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,840
This is why you have to leave.
If you keep thinking there is a solution...

519
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,400
you'll die here.

520
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,240
I can't leave her.

521
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,840
I'll figure it out.

522
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,880
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

523
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,440
There are no answers.

524
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,320
Only choices.

525
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,200
Rheya?

526
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,160
Rheya?

527
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,960
Rheya?

528
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,400
Rheya?

529
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,840
Gordon!

530
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,320
- What happened?
- She drank liquid oxygen.

531
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,320
She's dead.

532
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,880
No.

533
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,200
I never get used to them.
These... resurrections.

534
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,640
Oh, no.

535
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,480
No.

536
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:33,480
Why'd you do that?

537
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,440
Rheya?

538
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,520
Don't call me that.

539
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,040
<i>There are two components.</i>

540
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,120
A high-energy proton accelerator
and a matter phase modulator.

541
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,120
By adjusting the tuning frequency I get an
enhancement of Higgs antibosons at 90GHz

542
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,280
and an almost pure beam at 160GHz.

543
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,360
I used it on mine.

544
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,360
What happens?

545
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,440
They disappear,
back where they came from.

546
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,280
It's what she wants.

547
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,520
I won't let her do it.

548
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,080
She'll come to me when you're asleep.

549
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,640
Then I won't sleep.

550
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,160
<i>Don't you see?
I came from your memory of her.</i>

551
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400
<i>That's the problem. I'm not a whole person.</i>

552
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,120
In your memory
you get to control everything.

553
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,840
So even if you remember something wrong,
I am predetermined to carry it out.

554
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,400
I'm suicidal because
that's how you remember me.

555
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,960
My voice sounds the way it does
because that's how you remember it.

556
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,360
I don't believe that we're
predetermined to relive our past.

557
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,840
I think that we can choose to do it differently.

558
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:18,560
The day I left and you said you wouldn't make
it, I didn't hear you because I was angry.

559
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,320
This is my chance to undo that mistake.

560
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,960
And I need you to help me.

561
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,400
But am I really Rheya?

562
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,520
I don't know any more.

563
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,120
All I see is you.

564
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,160
All I see is you.

565
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,240
It created me.

566
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,960
And yet I can't communicate with it.

567
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,920
It must hear me, though.

568
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,440
It must know what's happening to me.

569
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,720
And you and I, we would
have to have some kind of...

570
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,000
an arrangement, some kind of...

571
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,920
unspoken understanding...

572
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,200
that I'm not really a human being.

573
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,480
No, Rheya.

574
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,280
Chris...

575
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,520
Chris, I wish you would just
let them use the device on me.

576
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:21,120
And then you can go back to Earth
and you can tell everybody all about Solaris.

577
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,040
No.

578
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,160
It's the only solution that makes any sense.

579
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,400
We could never have
a life together on Earth, Chris.

580
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,080
You know that.

581
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,280
It would be impossible.

582
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,680
And this? What kind of life is this?

583
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,680
Trapped here.

584
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,120
It's not a life.

585
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,840
I don't know what to call it.

586
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,360
It's what we have.

587
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,600
It's enough for me.

588
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,400
You need to rest.

589
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,480
You're going to make yourself ill.

590
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,080
- I don't care.
- Just lie down for a moment.

591
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,000
Please, Chris.

592
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,880
You have to rest.

593
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,680
You know I'm not human
so I don't understand what you're afraid of.

594
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,160
Of course you can use the device.

595
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,680
It's not murder. You said that yourself.

596
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,360
You're the one who had
the idea in the first place.

597
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,680
Chris doesn't trust me. He...

598
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,520
<i>Chris, don't blame Gordon.</i>

599
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:54,680
<i>It's not her fault. I begged her to do it.</i>

600
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,480
<i>It's better this way.</i>

601
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,600
<i>I found the suicide note.</i>

602
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,800
<i>I went through your things.</i>

603
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,120
<i>The page torn from the book of poems.</i>

604
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,160
<i>And I realised...</i>

605
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,960
<i>I'm not her.</i>

606
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,640
<i>I'm not Rheya.</i>

607
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,680
<i>I know you loved me, though.</i>

608
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,120
<i>I know that. I felt that.</i>

609
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,760
<i>And I love you.</i>

610
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,120
<i>I wish we could just
live inside that feeling forever.</i>

611
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,680
<i>Maybe there's a place where we can.</i>

612
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,040
<i>But I know it's not on Earth.</i>

613
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,160
<i>And it's not on this ship.</i>

614
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,360
<i>That's all I can say right now.</i>

615
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,600
- You killed her!
- Not her. It.

616
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,520
- It's murder!
- Kelvin, she begged me. It wasn't painful.

617
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,000
- She'll be back!
- No.

618
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,840
- Why would you let her do it?!
- Kelvin!

619
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,840
It's not human!

620
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,320
Whatever it is, it's not human,
and I'm threatened by that.

621
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,200
And I wanna win. I want humans to win.

622
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,240
Whose side are you on?

623
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,800
- What are you doing?
- Putting the Al back online. I'm going home.

624
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,120
Gordon.

625
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,600
Gordon!

626
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,480
- I knew it.
- How long you think he's been dead?

627
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:31,160
Hard to say because of the cold.

628
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,960
He attacked me.

629
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,600
There I am. Somehow, there I am.

630
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,360
And I couldn't tell you how I'm there,
or who I am or what's going on.

631
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,960
But before I can get to that,

632
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,360
what's this over here?

633
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,040
Comin' at me. What...
what are you tryin' to do?

634
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,240
Oh, I see. You're tryin' to kill me.

635
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:02,320
Yeah, confusing. I'll tell you somethin'
confusing. Bingo, there you are,

636
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,040
and my welcoming committee
dropped his knife and it's good night.

637
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,400
And, oh, by the way, after all that I find, uh...

638
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,200
this, uh, whoever this... I get my first
good look at it and it happens to be...

639
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,320
I survive the first 30 seconds of this...

640
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,320
life, whatever you wanna call it...
by killing someone.

641
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,800
And, oh, ah, by killing someone
who happens to be me.

642
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,720
See, most people... I would think most people
in this position would be, like "This... ah."

643
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,480
"I don't know." However, this is at least...
This is an incredible opportunity.

644
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,200
This is... What if this is a gift? I'm a gift.

645
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,920
Hey.

646
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,200
I say we use the Higgs device on him.

647
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,800
Mm. Mm-mm.

648
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,640
I don't think you really have time.

649
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,680
Why would you say that?

650
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,040
Well, you know, ever since
we used the famous Higgs device,

651
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:14,160
Solaris started taking on mass exponentially.

652
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:18,400
You might have noticed
how we're a lot closer to it.

653
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,640
That would be because everything
within its gravitational field -

654
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,720
it's pulling it in.

655
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,360
Ah, and, yeah, sorry. By the way,

656
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,680
the Higgs device also
drained the fuel cell reactors.

657
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:43,000
Uh, if... Can I make a suggestion?

658
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:48,000
I mean, this is... You can do what you want,
but I would just lock me in here really tight

659
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,320
and take the "Athena" back.

660
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,560
Wear your seat belt.

661
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,680
Switch to internal power.

662
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,200
Start fuel cell operational diagnostic.

663
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,320
Service check on LGA.

664
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,520
Point and calibrate high-beam antenna.

665
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,280
Depressurising. Spin all turbines to standby.

666
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,800
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

667
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,800
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

668
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,040
<i>Earth.</i>

669
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,960
<i>Even the word sounded strange to me now.</i>

670
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,680
<i>Unfamiliar.</i>

671
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,880
<i>How long had I been gone?</i>

672
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,160
<i>How long had I been back?</i>

673
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,040
<i>Did it matter?</i>

674
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:04,400
<i>I tried to find the rhythm
of the world where I used to live.</i>

675
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,480
<i>I followed the current.</i>

676
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,440
<i>I was silent and attentive.</i>

677
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,200
<i>I made a conscious effort to smile...</i>

678
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,360
<i>nod...</i>

679
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,920
<i>stand...</i>

680
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:26,400
<i>and perform the millions of gestures
that constitute life on Earth.</i>

681
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:33,600
<i>I studied these gestures
until they became reflexes again.</i>

682
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,680
<i>But I was haunted by the idea</i>

683
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,840
<i>that I remembered her wrong.</i>

684
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,480
<i>That somehow I was wrong about everything.</i>

685
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:54,000
Depressurising.
Spin all turbines to standby.

686
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,040
Disengage coupling interlocks
and all docking couplers.

687
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:03,080
Vent and seal
all main engine propellant lines.

688
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,080
Rheya!

689
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,880
Rheya?

690
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,800
Chris?

691
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,400
Chris?

692
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,600
Am I alive... or dead?

693
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,160
We don't have to think like that any more.

694
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,400
We're together now.

695
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,520
Everything we've done is forgiven.

696
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,000
Everything.
