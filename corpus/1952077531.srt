That's not
what wizards wear, Mambo.

8
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:16,141
The clothes don't make
the wizard, Munk.

9
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,160
It's the other way around.

10
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:23,331
Now what up with all this
"once upon a time" bidness?

11
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:24,499
That's old school.

12

We gots to make
the story fresh, yo.

You know,

We'll do it your way.

27

Good.

28
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:08,826
Now, Fairy Tale Land was ruled

Did you see that?

58
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:48,293
Mother, why does everyone
love the queen so much?

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,712
Because she is beautiful.

60
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,664
I want to be queen someday.

Just remember,
Snow White,

72
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:28,500
the mirror only tells
half the story.

73
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,868
True beauty comes
from helping others.

74

Yes, Mommy.

for the kingdom.

someone else
gets to be queen?

Hi, Daddy.
You like?

No. It's nice.

I'm just not sure that's
what a young princess wears.

Now, your mother,

the Ten Little Indians
Orphanage tonight?

131
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:20,505
But tonight's the opening

They're expecting me
to be there.

needed you, too.

138
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,136
So?
- So, honey,

139
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,138
there's more
to being a princess

140
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,725
than red carpets
and photo ops.

141
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,777
Honey, the children
always loved it

142
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,344
when your mother
visited them.

143
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,846
But they pick their noses.

It's so gross.

145
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,116

never seemed to mind.

your joust on, girl?

Go ahead.

152
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:08,803

unlike last time.

163
00:08:35,163 --> 00:08:36,597

wore this with pride.

00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,962
Since I decided I wanted
to get remarried.

551
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:10,033
Lady Vain, I'd like you

552
00:26:10,184 --> 00:26:12,018
to meet my daughter,
Snow White.

553
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,372
Mommy.

554
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:19,359
Snow White,
I knew you were pretty,

555
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:21,461
but now that I
see you up close,

556
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,213
you look just like
your mother.

557
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:27,100
And so do you.

558
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,070
She does have quite
a resemblance, doesn't she?

559
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:31,855
Daddy, what's going on?

560
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:36,559
I decided I wanted a wife
and you needed a mother.

561
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:39,812
And lo and behold,
in walks Lady Vain.

562
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,115
She's just perfect,
isn't she?

563
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,950
Too perfect. Oh!

564
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,786
This is, like,
totally crazy!

565
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,721
<i>I mean, you don't</i>
<i>even know this woman!</i>

566
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:50,607
[Munk]
What's happening?

567
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,693
Whoa! Snow White
is arguing with her father.

568
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:55,077
This is getting good.

569
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:57,514
What?
What's going on?

570
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:58,682
Oh, no!

571
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,350
Get up here and help me!

572
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:04,087
<i>Snow White, I am going</i>
<i>to marry Lady Vain.</i>

573
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,273
Our wedding
is already planned.

574
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,024
Already planned?

575
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:10,577
Yes. When the cow
jumps over the moon,

576
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,312
and that is final.

577
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,464
No, it isn't!

578
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,719
[sighs]
Oh, dear.

579
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,721
Don't worry, honey bunny.

580
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:26,309
Snow White and I just need
some girl time together.

581
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:36,569
Oh! Snow White has to go.

582
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:37,687
She'll
ruin everything.

583
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:39,723
Oh. What happened?

584
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,275
She whined like
a spoiled brat!

585
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:44,244
She was so...

586
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:45,778
[groans]

587
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:47,880
And to think I spent
the entire day

588
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:50,083
listening to the king
go on and on

589
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:52,018
about Queen Grace.

590
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,653
Ugh! Oh...

591
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:55,322
Mirror, mirror
on the wall,

592
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,124
make me feel better
and tell me

593
00:27:57,191 --> 00:27:59,926
who is the fairest
of them all?

594
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:02,963
Go on.

595
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,664
Say what you always say.

596
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:08,384
Em, well...

597
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:10,319
Well, what?

598
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,355
Am I not fairest
of them all?

599
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:15,324
Well, now that I've
seen Snow White,

600
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:19,328
I gotta say she's looking
pretty darn fantastic

601
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:20,564
on the old fairest-o-meter.

602
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:21,565
I mean...
[laughs]

603
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,869
have you ever seen
such a natural beauty?

604
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,121
And have you ever seen
a cracked mirror?

605
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:30,890
Aah!

606
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,509
And then what would
become of the new you?

607
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:36,612
My power sustains
your illusion.

608
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,014
I can't destroy you,

609
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,750
but you could spend the rest
of your happily ever after

610
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:41,851
in a closet!

611
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,186
Ahh.

612
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,189
The power of vanity.

613
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,357
[laughing]

614
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,476
Get over here
and help me with this!

615
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:51,895
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

616
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,629
Waa-ha-ha!

617
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,882
Oh, yeah!

618
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,400
[grunting]

619
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,602
Ow! Oh.

620
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,537
I'm here
to save the day.

621
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:05,358
Ugh. Just pull this rope.

622
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:10,063
[both grunting, straining]

623
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,168
So, how to deal with little
Miss Teen Queen Wannabe.

624
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:17,671
[both grunting]

625
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,739
Whoa!

626
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,925
<i>[gasps]</i>

627
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,894
<i>Hmm.</i>

628
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:27,297
<i>[chuckling]</i>

629
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:29,382
[sighs] Uh-oh.
- Oh...

630
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,918
Now we're in
really big trouble.

631
00:29:32,986 --> 00:29:37,990
I still don't understand
the purpose of this scheme.

632
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:39,525
Gossip.

633
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:43,313
If used properly,
it can ruin a reputation,

634
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,283
but not necessarily
about the person

635
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,817
being gossiped about.

636
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,419
Precisely.

637
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,705
And one bite
of this magic apple

638
00:29:51,772 --> 00:29:53,906
will make Snow White
say the rudest things

639
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:55,542
she ever thought possible.

640
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:56,960
Really?

641
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:57,961
[sniffing]

642
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,864
Ooh! Whoo!

643
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:03,399
You can be such a nag.

644
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,534
[laughing]

645
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:07,520
Lady Vain is rotten
to the core.

646
00:30:07,587 --> 00:30:11,224
[laughing]
Apple joke.

647
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,592
Well, the apple works.

648
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:20,300
But-- But I don't know
anything about makeovers.

649
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,934
That's obvious.

650
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:24,221
Just poof and cream,
and you'll do fine.

651
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:25,688
It's all about attitude.

652
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:28,091
Poof and cream.

653
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,693
Okay.

654
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,394
Snow White, honey.

655
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,630
It's Lady Vain.

656
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,132
Go away!

657
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,267
Please?

658
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,669
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

659
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,840
My friend Rumpy is the top
hair, nail, and face man

660
00:30:43,907 --> 00:30:45,542
in the kingdom.

661
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,678
I've convinced him
to give you a makeover

662
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:51,480
as my little gift to you.

663
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:52,748
Makeover?

664
00:30:54,851 --> 00:31:00,423
So, uh, let's take
a look at you, yes.

665
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,892
My! Uh...

666
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,327
what pretty hair
you have, yes.

667
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,547
Thanks.
- And, uh...

668
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,551
what-- what a beautiful
set of eyes you have.

669
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,286
Oh, that's so sweet.

670
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:17,056
Ooh! And what big teeth
you have, huh?

671
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:17,941
What?

672
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,425
Ooh!

673
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,744
Oh, yes. Uh...

674
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:25,248
So, uh, let's
get started, yes.

675
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,285
First, we will...

676
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:31,254
uh, poof the hair!

677
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,256
Give it some air.

678
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,626
Let it breathe
like fine wine, yes.

679
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,095
Breathe. Breathe.

680
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,447
Breathe. Yes.

681
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:45,451
Um, Rumpy, I think
that's enough poofing.

682
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,770
Oh, yes.
Well, of course.

683
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:50,739
Yeah. So, uh,
now, we will--

684
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,308
[muttering]

685
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:53,409
[clattering]

686
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:54,844
No. Uh...

[chuckling]

688
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,446
Rumpy, don't you think

689
00:31:57,514 --> 00:31:59,615
Snow White is looking
a little pale?

690
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:00,800
Really?

691
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,802
Well, I feel fine.

692
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:05,538
Don't you have something
you can give her?

693
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,074
Wh-What?

694
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,410
Oh, uh, yes!

695
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:12,912
Indeed, I do.

696
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:14,931
Uhh! What?
Where is it?

697
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,799
Oh! Oh! Ah.

698
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,067
Here.
- Oh.

699
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,602
Eat this.

700
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,855
An apple?
- Oh, yes.

701
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:26,075
It'll make you feel better
than pease-porridge pie.

702
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:27,376
But I feel fine.

703
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:30,013
It's good for the skin.

704
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,898
Oh. Oh!

705
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,533
No!
- No! Don't!

Bright and pretty.
Yes, it's true.

914
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:22,020
Yep, she did.

915
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:24,089
Your mother loved
to help people.

916
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:26,892
She was a beautiful woman.

917
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:27,959
Yeah.

918
00:42:28,027 --> 00:42:29,428
So what be
bringing you down

919
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,397
to our neck of the woods,
Snow White?

920
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,764
Oh.
[chuckle]

921
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:36,302
Well, I had a little situation
back at the kingdom.

922
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,238
What kind of situation?

923
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,223
Well, I guess it all started

924
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,958
when I went to
Mamma Goose's Joust House.

925
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:46,145
I was supposed to go
to the orphanage, but...

926
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:48,214
...so after I said
all those horrible things--

927
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:50,549
which I would never
usually say, really--

928
00:42:50,616 --> 00:42:52,168
the Damsels, my dad,

929
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:54,353
and everyone,
like, totally freaked.

930
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,426
She may look
like her mother,

931
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:03,262
but she sure don't
act like her.

932
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,629
[Dwarves]
Hear, hear.

933
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:07,532
Come on, now.
Cut the girl some slack.

934
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,534
Her mother died
when she was young.

935
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,825
In fact, I'd say
it's our duty to fix her up

936
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:19,628
into the woman her mother
would have wanted her to be.

937
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:22,814
Oh, we should be doing
that for sure, yes!

938
00:43:22,882 --> 00:43:24,849
For Queen Grace.

939
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,785
[together]
For Queen Grace.

940
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:29,772
Snow White,
we're gonna help you

941
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,607
win back your friends,
family, and home.

942
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,342
But you have
to do everything

943
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,412
we tell you to do,
no questions asked.

944
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,582
Well, okay.

945
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,986
Come again?

946
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,520
You want me to do what?

947
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:47,306
Shovel some sticks
and straw.

948
00:43:47,373 --> 00:43:48,473
No way.

949
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:51,210
But why?

950
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:52,327
Hello!

951
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:53,929
I'm a princess.

952
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:55,564
I don't shovel.

953
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:58,750
Okay.

954
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:02,371
But there's wolves
in them woods.

955
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:06,775
[howling]
[gasp]

956
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:07,977
[howling continues]

957
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,149
Fine.

958
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,150
Happy now?

959
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:21,023
No! No! No! No! No!

960
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:23,175
No! Ooh!

961
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,843
Definitely no!

962
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:27,112
But, My Lady,

963
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,915
these are the finest
wedding dresses

964
00:44:30,016 --> 00:44:31,650
in all the kingdom.

965
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:33,986
Sewn by peasants,
no doubt.

966
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,955
Pitiful, all of them.

967
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:40,459
I want only the finest dress
made by the finest hands.

968
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:44,280
Um, My Lady, there was
this cream-colored number

969
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,449
we saw over in Wonderland.

970
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,650
The cute little
strapless couture

971
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,519
with organza
and gold thread?

972
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,089
And the draped pickups
and cinched pleats.

973
00:44:53,156 --> 00:44:55,424
Uh, it was to die for.

974
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,793
We could get it
on back order.

975
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,363
Ooh, but it might
take a little while.

976
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:02,831
Can we push
the wedding back,

977
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:04,950
say, um, a month?

978
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,117
Enough!

979
00:45:06,185 --> 00:45:08,370
How dare you subject me
to these peasants.

980
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:09,371
[door opens]

981
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:10,473
Have you seen
Snow White?

982
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,858
Has she returned
to the castle yet?

983
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:15,794
No, but I'm sure
she'll be along soon.

984
00:45:15,862 --> 00:45:18,163
You know
how young girls are.

985
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:19,898
I hope you're right.

986
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,368
Trust me, dear.

987
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:23,418
Hmph.

988
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:27,823
[sighs]

989
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,324
Now what?

990
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:33,195
Maybe it's time for a
little more direct approach.

991
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,147
So, my dear,
tomorrow's a big day.

992
00:45:36,183 --> 00:45:38,851
Are you excited
to meet the kingdom?

993
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:42,087
Did Peter Piper
pick a pickled pepper?

994
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:44,656
[chuckling]
Excellent.

995
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:46,625
Did someone
order bodyguards

996
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:48,794
from the employment service?

997
00:45:48,862 --> 00:45:49,861
That's me.

998
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:51,397
Send them in.

999
00:45:55,668 --> 00:45:57,052
Bodyguards?

1000
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,156
Honey bunny, I'm not used
to being among the people.

1001
00:46:01,224 --> 00:46:02,875
It makes me nervous.

1002
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:05,744
Oh. Well, I suppose.

1003
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,279
Now run along.

1004
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,281
We'll play some patty-cake
a little later.

1005
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,551
Oh! I love patty-cake!

1006
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:16,721
I'll make this simple.

1007
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,357
No touching, no hugging,

1008
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:20,091
no rubbing, no tugging,
no kissing babies,

1009
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,593
no "let's take
a picture together

1010
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:23,061
for my brother
who's a big fan,"

1011
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:25,597
for I am royalty and
they are the commoners.

1012
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:27,599
Can you handle that?

1013
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:31,603
But, My Lady, you are going
to be the queen of the people.

1014
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,172
Why would you want
to keep them away?

1015
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,741
[snickering]

1016
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:37,476
You are the first guard.

1017
00:46:37,543 --> 00:46:39,478
You are the alternate.

1018
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,655
[Snow White muttering]

1019
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:51,990
Ow! Ooh!

1020
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:54,993

1021

1022
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:01,600
Sorry. Ohh!

1023
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:04,736
Where are we going again?

1024
00:47:04,804 --> 00:47:05,837
Ohh!

1025
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:07,906
We have some work
to do.

1026
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:09,674
[huffs]
More work?

1027
00:47:09,742 --> 00:47:11,410
But I did that already!

1028
00:47:11,477 --> 00:47:15,547
The deal was "no questions asked."
Remember?

1029
00:47:15,598 --> 00:47:17,166
Whatever.

1030
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:19,001
Just remember, my dear,

1031
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:23,104
the job gets harder when you
only think of yourself.

The Big Bad Wolf
went a bit crazy

1038
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,395
and blew down
two of their houses.

1039
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,730

help them rebuild.

The drawbridge is up!

1269

[nervous chuckle]

1271
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,404
Can't we use the back door?

1272
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:44,572
No time.

1274
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:55,683
Ohhh!

1275
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,885
We've got to stop the wedding.

1276
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:59,320
But how?

1277
01:00:59,387 --> 01:01:02,190
[Peter, Snow White]
Whoa!

Snow White!

1279

Oh, it's good
to see you, My Lady.

1280
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:09,981
Am I too late?

1281
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:11,532
You couldn't cut it
any closer.

1282
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,367
Come on.

1283
01:01:16,522 --> 01:01:20,541
Do you, Lady Vain,
take this man

1284
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:24,412
to be your lawful
wedded husband,

1285
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:26,431

1286

[Mirror]
Uh-oh.

1287
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,484
This might be trouble.

1288
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,220
...good times and bad--
Psst!

1289
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:34,939
Pssst!

1290
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:37,158
Psst. Poof.
Yoo-hoo. Look.

1291
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:40,461
...from this day forward?

1292
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:42,180
Yes, yes, I do.
- Hmm?

1293
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:43,714
Can we hurry
this along?

1294
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,984
Ahem. Oh, yes.
Of course.

1295
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:49,437
And do you, King Cole--

1296
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:51,522
Hello,
Fashion Police.

Oh.

01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,713
Snow White.

1301
01:01:58,781 --> 01:01:59,981
You're back.

1302
01:02:00,032 --> 01:02:03,034
Now is not the best time
for reunions, honey bunny.

1303
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:06,271
Dad, if you truly love
Lady Vain,

1304
01:02:06,338 --> 01:02:07,938
then marry her.

1305
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:09,573
I won't try to stop you.

1306
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:14,762
But if you're doing this
because I've been a brat,

1307
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,282
then, well...

1308
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:19,116
I've changed.

1309
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:20,485
I found my way.

1310
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:23,237
Why must you ruin
my wedding?

1311
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:25,490
She hasn't changed at all.

1312
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:28,125
I mean, what has she
ever done for anybody?

1313
01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:30,027
[murmuring]

1314
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:34,816
[Pinocchio]
She fixed my nose.

1315
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:39,803
And she put me back together
after I fell down.

1316
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:42,273
She helped
rebuild our home.

1317
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,693
And helped me look prettier
than I've ever looked.

1318
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:48,630
[Girl]
And she sang to me when I was sad.

1319
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:50,364
[Girl #2]
And tucked us into bed.

1320
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:52,967
Wow. Girl really has changed.

1321
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:57,105
She did all the things
a queen is supposed to do.

1322
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,357
Except one.

1323
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:06,263
I want to apologize
to everyone I've ever hurt.

1324
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:08,549
Especially you, Dad.

1325
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,220
Everything you loved
about my mother,

1326
01:03:12,287 --> 01:03:14,288
I hope you can love
about me.

1327
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:17,258

my daughter back.

1330
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:29,437
Maybe breaking the balance
was not so bad after all.

1331
01:03:29,504 --> 01:03:31,856
[Lady Vain]
No! No! No! No!

1332
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:34,692
This isn't
how the story ends!

1333
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,194
You may have spoken
too soon.

1334
01:03:37,263 --> 01:03:40,431
Mother always told me that
if I was beautiful enough,

1335
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:41,633
I would be queen!

1336
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,501
And if I can't be queen,

1337
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,220
then, mirror mirror
in the hall,

1338
01:03:46,288 --> 01:03:48,556

You don't need a magic
mirror to be beautiful.

Really?

01:06:14,119 --> 01:06:15,486
