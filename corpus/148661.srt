1
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,880
Some things start out big,

2
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,760
and some things
start out small, very small.

3
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,660
But sometimes the smallest thing...

4
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,390
can make the biggest changes of all.

5
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,370
- Yar, what is it?
- I don't know.

6
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,380
Plio, get back here!
We don't know what it is!

7
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,310
Plio, be careful.

8
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,620
Dad, get over here.

9
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,760
- Zini, it's not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go
when stuff's happening.

10
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,470
Well, what is it?

11
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,270
It was an egg. Look.

12
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,280
- What?
- It's a cold-blooded monster
from across the sea.

13
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,940
- Vicious, flesh-eating.
- Blech.

14
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,180
- Eew.
- Looks like a baby to me.

15
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,090
Babies grow up. You keep that thing,
one day, we'll turn our backs--

16
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,530
it'll be picking us
out of its teeth.

17
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,160
- Things like that
eat things like us as snacks!

18
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,670
So, what do we do?

19
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,930
Get rid of it!

20
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,740
What has gotten into you?

21
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,480
Plio, that thing is dangerous!

22
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm sorry, little one.

23
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,880
Okay, get rid of it.

24
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,120
All right. I will.

25
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,870
You'd better hurry up, Dad.
It looks hungry.

26
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,270
Here.

27
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,430
It's okay.

28
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,170
- We'll teach him to hate meat.
- Hmph.

29
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,020
Watch his head.

30
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,520
I-I mean, watch it,
he could bite.

31
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,690
This monster's
got no teeth.

32
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,500
What's he gonna do?
Gum us to death?

33
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,960
[Plio] Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.

34
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,600
Does that look
like a monster to you?

35
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,350
Let me out! Let me out!

36
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,850
Hair ball.

37
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,920
That was great! Get him!

38
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,320
Oh, no! Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!

39
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,090
I can't take it! There
are too many of you! Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!

40
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,100
Help!

41
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,770
Oh, no--

42
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,450
Aladar,
you're not dead.

43
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,520
No!

44
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,750
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?

45
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,450
- You gonna miss
seeing all that smooching.
- Oh, Mom.

46
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,360
- That's okay, Plio.
We can smooch right here.

47
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,730
- It's a shame you don't like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.

48
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,570
Ha-ha. Go find Zini.

49
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,630
He's rehearsing pickup lines.
Let's hope he's found
some new material.

50
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Hey, sweetie, if you'll be my bride,
I'll groom ya.

51
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,080
That is good.
Oh, that's good.

52
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,810
Girls, I'm known
as the "professor of love",

53
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,620
and school's in session.

54
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,960
- Yeah, I still got it.
- I hope it's not contagious.

55
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,000
- I'm a raging epidemic of romance.
- Come on, hot stuff.

56
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,260
Let's get goin'. You don't wanna miss
Yar's annual pep talk.

57
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,700
[Zini] Oh, goody. I can't wait to
hear the mating advice of an old monkey.

58
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,370
[Aladar] Hey-hey-hey, I heard that in
his day, that old monkey was quite a swinger.

59
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,780
- [Zini] You talkin' about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it,

60
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,780
he put the "prime" in "primate".

61
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,410
[Zini] Really?

62
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,620
Okay, boys, gather 'round.
Listen and learn from the master.

63
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,660
Now, girls, don't jump into the trees
after the first boy with a cute back flip.

64
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,090
It's more fun
if you keep them guessing.

65
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,430
And if a cute back flip
doesn't work, guess.

66
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,100
You're never going to forget this day,
so make it one to remember.

67
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,770
But if you mess up, don't worry.
They'll never remember.

68
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,070
Come on, guys!
We don't wanna let 'em down!

69
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,120
- Go on, now. Chest up! Chin up!
- [Lemur] Whoo!

70
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,980
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.

71
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,580
My charm and your brains? No problem.

72
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,460
Ha-ha!

73
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,830
- Hey, girls, look what just pulled into town.
- [Lemur] Hey, ladies!

74
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,960
Your buffet table of love.

75
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,200
- Right here! Right here!
- Hey, beautiful!

76
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,610
Hey, free samples!
Get me while I'm hot!

77
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,940
Whoa!

78
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,180
Zini.

79
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,390
- Whoo! Wah-hoo!
- [Lemur] Whoo!

80
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,690
Yah-hoo!

81
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,610
- [Aladar] You're missin'
all the action, pal. Come on.

82
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,810
[Zini] Hey, haven't you heard?
I am the action!

83
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,370
Ah, don't worry, Zini.
You always have next year.

84
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,460
Hey, I'm lucky to be rid of them.
With the ladies,

85
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,570
- before you know it,
they all wanna move to a bigger tree.

86
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,080
Oh, well. Poor Zini.
The clan still has one bachelor.

87
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,680
No, we have two.

88
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,220
Well, it's never
really been his best event.

89
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,060
He's got a tougher hide than mine.
- Oh, Aladar,

90
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,630
if only there was someone
on the island for you.

91
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,430
Well, you know, who looks like you,
but prettier.

92
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,480
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?

93
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,450
Whoa!

94
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,330
- What are they?
- I don't know.

95
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,500
Dad?

96
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,510
Something's wrong.

97
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,840
Aladar, where's Suri?

98
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,510
She's up in the... tree.

99
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,250
Come on! Go! Go!
Come on!

100
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,290
- [Suri] Mom!
- Suri!

101
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,720
- Mom! Mom!
- Suri!

102
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,590
- Mom!
- [Aladar] Suri, where are you?

103
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,530
Run, Aladar!
Run! Run!

104
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,050
[Aladar] Yar, come on!

105
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,550
- [Plio] Zini, jump! Jump!
- [Aladar] Zini, jump!

106
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,920
[Plio] Hold on!

107
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,510
Plio! Yar! Where are you?

108
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,320
Aladar, over here!

109
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,710
I feel bad. I feel bad.

110
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,250
Oh, Suri.
Easy, easy.

111
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,290
They're all gone.

112
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,950
Shh, shh. I'm here.

113
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,260
Come on.
We can't stay here.

114
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,260
Now, now, Suri.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

115
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,530
- Look!
- Whoa!

116
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,800
- Did you see that?
- [Yar] What?
- [Zini] I did.

117
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,300
- [Suri] Me too!
- [Plio] Where did it go?
- I don't know. Let's go see.

118
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,080
- Leave it alone. Hey!
- [Plio] Shh, Dad.

119
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,580
- [Yar] It's scaring Suri.
- [Suri] No, it's not.

120
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,410
Everyone just be quiet.

121
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,450
- [Yar] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [Plio] Yar, grab on!

122
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,620
[Yar] I can't reach!

123
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,400
[Plio] Aladar, they're stopping!

124
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,600
Huh?

125
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,480
Stay out of my way!

126
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,780
You heard Kron.
Move it!

127
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
Watch it.

128
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,480
[Yar] Zini, get your head down.

129
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,900
Walkin' backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that
gets you there any faster.

130
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,750
Keep those little legs movin'
Url, or you'll get left behind.

131
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,340
Look at all the Aladars.

132
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,670
- If you're even thinking
of joining them--

133
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,510
Hang on! Hang on!

134
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,900
[Male Dinosaur] Kron,

135
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,240
there is a more protected spot
further down the--

136
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,940
- We'll rest here for the night.
Go ahead, Bruton.

137
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,090
Oh, Eema, I wish we were
at your nesting grounds now.

138
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,260
All this pushing
and shoving about,

139
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,500
just for a place to sleep.

140
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,230
I'm not used
to this kind of behavior.

141
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,840
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick. Git!

142
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,810
Ooh, I couldn't possibly.

143
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,150
Shoo, shoo.

144
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,310
Will you come on, Baylene? You wanna get
to the nesting grounds alive?

145
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,520
- Show some backbone.
- Hey, there.

146
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,750
Oh, sorry about that.

147
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,690
Uh, it's just,
we overheard you talking, and, um--

148
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,430
Well, my word.
Look at Url.

149
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,400
- He doesn't normally
warm up to strangers so fast.

150
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,610
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath'd clear those right up.

151
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,880
Excuse me?

152
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,510
Um, he's my grandfather,
couple of times removed.

153
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,110
Try a couple of species removed.

154
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,790
Uh, my name's Aladar.
This is my family.
We're... all that's left.

155
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,560
Oh, my dear.
I'm so sorry.

156
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,930
Baylene's the last of her kind.
Finding stragglers like her
all along the way.

157
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,800
I heard you say something
about... nesting grounds?

158
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,000
It is the most beautiful place
there is, child.

159
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,510
It's where the herd goes
to have their babies.

160
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,480
Will we find anybody
that looks... like us there?

161
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,720
Oh, the last few days,
I've seen 'em all shapes and sizes.

162
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,160
Who knows what we'll find.

163
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,360
The hard job now
is just getting there.

164
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,560
- And we're being driven unmercifully.
- By who?

165
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,070
Kron, the herd's head honcho.

166
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,500
We can hardly keep up.
An older woman like myself--

167
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,940
It's-- Well,
it's positively indecent.

168
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,600
- Then tell him.
What's the worst he can do?

169
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,870
Oh!

170
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,420
Hey!

171
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,540
What's his problem?

172
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,560
- That's him, honey. Kron.
- Huh.

173
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,590
- Uh, excuse me!
Kron, got a second?

174
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,930
- Get lost, kid.
- Hmm. Relax, Bruton.

175
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,730
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.

176
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,810
Why aren't you uphill
with the--

177
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,040
uh, young bloods?

178
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,240
- Well, I was back here
talking to these guys.

179
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,150
- I guess they--
They're having a hard time keeping up.

180
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,950
- So, you know, maybe you
could slow it down a bit?

181
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,120
Hmm. Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there's an idea.

182
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,430
Better let me do the thinking
from now on, Aladar.

183
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,660
- Hey, they need help back here.
- Hmm.

184
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:47,140
Watch yourself, boy.

185
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,000
Don't worry. That's how my brother
treats newcomers,

186
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,250
no matter how charming
they are.

187
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,880
You sure know how to catch a girl's eye,
there, stud.

188
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,790
I wouldn't be catchin' nobody's eye
if I was you, especially Neera's.

189
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,690
You just keep your head down,
and you mind what Kron tells you.

190
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,630
Since when do we take orders
from the likes of him?

191
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,460
Kron has swatted flies
bigger than you, pops.

192
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,730
I could hold that monster's brain
in the palm of my--

193
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,200
No, Yar, she's right.
Better to keep our heads down
with this bunch...

194
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,430
- than get 'em
bitten off by... those things.

195
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,210
Well, you just consider yourself lucky
that's all that's following us.

196
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,340
Hey, wake up.

197
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,510
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You're ravishing already.

198
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,550
Hey! Hello!
Anybody in there?

199
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,450
Zini, what are you doing?

200
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,390
I believe you left a wake-up call
for the dawn of time.

201
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,890
- Come on! Move it!
- What's the hurry?

202
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,520
[Zini] Something's up.
The herd's gathering without us.
Let's check it out.

203
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,500
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.

204
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,360
Come on. Get up. On your feet.

205
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,100
Huh. The charm
never stops around here.

206
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,500
You say something?

207
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,240
Uh, no-- no, sir.

208
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,740
Unless you got a death wish,

209
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:40,250
you and that little parasite
better get moving!

210
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,080
Sheesh, is that guy ugly or what?

211
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,750
Hey, hey, hey,
there's your girlfriend.

212
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,200
- What are you talkin' about?
- You know what I'm talkin' about: Neera.

213
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,800
Scaly skin. Yellow eyes. Big ankles.

214
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,930
Yeah, I made a real impression
on her.

215
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,530
What you need is a little help
from the love monkey.

216
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,640
- "The love monkey"?
- Ow, baby!

217
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,950
Ow!

218
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,050
That, children,

219
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,320
is what's known as a "jerkasaurus".

220
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,230
And with that, the ice is broken.

221
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,600
We've got a lot of first-timers here.
Make sure they get it.

222
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,940
We stop for nothing
and no one.

223
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,990
[Bruton] If this is
your first crossing, listen up.

224
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,620
- There is no water
till we reach the other side.

225
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,690
And you'd better keep up, 'cause
if a predator catches you,
you're on your own. Move out!

226
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,300
[Baylene] Oh, my goodness.

227
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,940
- It looks like a very long walk.
- [Eema] And hot.

228
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,020
If you smell somethin' sizzlin',
it could be me.

229
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,780
We're moving too slow.

230
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,380
I'll pick up the pace.

231
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,400
Hey, old girl,
you're wandering off a bit.

232
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:09,400
That's all I need:
a monkey on my back.

233
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,740
[Aladar] On your feet, Eema.

234
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,570
We can't let those things
eat you.

235
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,380
They're out there
waiting.

236
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,420
- The lake!
- [Yar] We made it?

237
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,000
[Eema] It's just over that--
that hill, baby.

238
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,130
Oh, thank goodness.

239
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,970
Come on, Eema.
Water. Remember water?

240
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,670
Oh, it's time
to refresh my memory.

241
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,600
[Eema] I'm just gonna walk
right into that lake...

242
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,670
- until the water's
up to my eyeballs...

243
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,180
and soak it all in.

244
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,060
Maybe the rains
collected somewhere else.

245
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,600
What do you want us to do?

246
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,040
Take a scout
and check the entire perimeter.

247
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,080
Enough! You have to be strong now.

248
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,240
The nesting grounds
are only a few days away. Keep moving!

249
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,520
- Kron, we've never gone
this long without water.

250
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,460
If we keep going like this,
we'll lose half the herd.

251
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,120
Then we save the half
that deserves to live.

252
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:37,040
What? They're moving already?
Oh-ho, we'll never keep up.

253
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,510
There was water here,
always water here before.

254
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,280
We always had water, always.

255
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,950
- And-- And plenty of mud.
- Oh, Eema, please.

256
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,790
The herd won't wait.
We must carry on.

257
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,130
You gotta get up.

258
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,900
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.

259
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,250
- Baylene, don't move.
- Oh, what is it?

260
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,460
What's wrong?

261
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,630
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do. Lift your foot, Baylene.

262
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,000
Now press down.

263
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,680
I always did like big girls!

264
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,050
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!

265
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,720
- Water! Come on!
- He found water.

266
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,990
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

267
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,550
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and--

268
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,020
Good. Now, get out of the way.

269
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:49,210
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

270
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,690
- Oh.
- Eema!

271
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,290
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

272
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,300
Bruton, we've been walking in circles.
There's no water here.

273
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,640
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

274
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,890
Let's get out of here.

275
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,190
Now, you come out on three.

276
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,890
One, two, three!

277
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,530
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

278
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,870
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

279
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,870
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

280
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,030
I think they're scared of me.

281
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,540
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

282
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,780
Come on over, guys.

283
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,680
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.

284
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,350
Come on. He's gonna
find you some water.

285
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,670
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and press.

286
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,010
He-hey. Come on. Come on.
Knock it off.

287
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,350
Let's - let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?

288
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,580
One, two, three. Press!

289
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,260
Good job, Suri.

290
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,200
- So, where are your parents, anyway?
- A lot of us are on our own now.

291
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,470
You like kids, I see.

292
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,010
- Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

293
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm Aladar,
the... "jerkasaurus".

294
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,710
Ohh. Sorry, about that.

295
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,790
Probably right.

296
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,120
- Dad, wake up.
- Huh?

297
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,650
Why did you
help that old one?

298
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,290
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?

299
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,900
Oh. You mean, you actually--

300
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,200
Well, that happens all the time.

301
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,930
- You don't survive if you're not--
- Strong enough.

302
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,270
Well... yeah.

303
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,970
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

304
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,980
Everything's so different.

305
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,520
I- I don't know
what to think anymore.

306
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,850
Look, Neera--
we watch out for each other,

307
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,860
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

308
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,090
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not,

309
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,590
but it's all I know.

310
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,890
So, um-- Oh, water.

311
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,490
I'll, uh,
get you some water.

312
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,510
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just... press.

313
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,450
- Sorry.
- No. You-- You first.

314
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,990
One down... and,

315
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,780
well, one down.

316
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,270
[Bruton] Kron!

317
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,750
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come this far north.

318
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,180
The fireball must've driven them out.

319
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,330
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!

320
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,990
Move the herd out,
double-time!

321
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,980
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

322
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,280
Kron, what's going on?

323
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,290
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

324
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,620
But... the others in the back--
They'll never make it.

325
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,490
They'll
slow down the predators.

326
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,500
You can't sacrifice them
like this!

327
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,120
- Hold it! That could be
you back there! Or you!

328
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,230
If you ever interfere again,

329
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,710
I'll kill you.

330
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,840
Stay away from him!

331
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,220
Aladar, no.
You just-- just go. I'll be okay.

332
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,320
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

333
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,300
- Carno-what?
- [Eema] Carnotaur.

334
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,340
A mouthful of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

335
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,200
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

336
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,740
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

337
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,640
Aladar, slow down.

339
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,630
Oh, joy. Blisters.

340
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,460
[Eema] I've got blisters
on my blisters.

341
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,130
- You don't wanna know
where I got blisters.

342
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,270
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

343
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,810
- Okay, what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

344
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,080
- Okay, what's the second-worst thing
it could be?
- Two carnotaurs! Oh!

345
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,310
- That's it. I'm gone.
- [Baylene] Oh, my goodness!

346
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,250
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.

347
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,330
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.

348
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,270
Oh, it's Bruton.

349
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,600
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

350
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,620
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. Oh, we should keep moving.

351
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,920
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.

352
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:03,530
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

353
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:09,010
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.

354
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,040
Suit yourself.

355
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,400
Change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

356
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,370
It's dark, but
at least it's dry.

357
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,210
- I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

358
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,050
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.

359
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,420
Sturdy little thing,
ain't he?

360
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,820
Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.

361
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,190
You coming in, or what?

362
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,120
What is it with you?

363
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,090
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

364
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,260
Now, come on.
On your feet.

365
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,220
- Uh, you can lie down
with us. It's warmer.

366
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,960
May I remind you
that he's one of them ?

367
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,440
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

368
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,410
Ahh. Who booked
this trip, anyway?

369
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,920
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

370
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,820
Well, when I get there,
I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.

371
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,980
You tell him, Eema.

372
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,670
[Yar] If I could sleep that deep,
I'd be in paradise.

373
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:57,070
[Eema] If you could
sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

374
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,850
This plant grew
on our island.

375
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,770
It will make you feel better.

376
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,900
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?

377
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,030
It's hope that's
gotten us this far.

378
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,940
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

379
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,410
I have accepted mine.

380
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,880
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.

381
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,540
It's the way things are.

382
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,050
Only if you give up,
Bruton.

383
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,720
It's your choice,
not your fate.

384
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,260
Well, the plant will help.

386
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,070
Carnotaurs.

387
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,980
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

388
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,100
Go! Go!

389
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,300
Hurry!

390
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,710
Move it, Eema!

391
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,050
[Plio] Aladar!

392
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,710
[Plio] Aladar! Oh, no!

393
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,990
- I'll hold them off!.
You help the others!

394
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,190
Bruton!

395
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,910
Bruton! No!

396
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,690
Bruton!

397
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,740
You did what you could.

398
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,180
It's okay, little ones.

399
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,850
We're going to make it.

400
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:09,900
[Zini] Okay, okay.
Let's do it again. Let's do it again.

401
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,210
- Uh, I spy with my little eye--
- A rock.

402
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,900
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!

403
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,720
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.

404
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,370
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

405
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,170
Hold on a moment.

406
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,930
Zini, what is it?

407
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,070
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

408
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:56,690
Get a load of that.
- [Baylene] Good show.

409
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:59,960
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!

410
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,970
Aladar, look out!

411
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,380
No!

412
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,180
Aladar, we'll go back.

413
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,020
Back to what?
It's gone.

414
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:07,130
We're not meant
to survive.

415
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,890
Oh, yes, we were.
We're here, aren't we?

416
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,460
And how dare you
waste that good fortune
by simply giving up?

417
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:18,130
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

418
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,170
The worst of it is,

419
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,780
you allowed an old fool like me
to believe I was needed--

420
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,110
that I still had a purpose--
and do you know what?

421
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,950
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

422
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,860
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

423
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,210
Oh, dear.

424
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:46,760
The nesting grounds.

425
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,530
It's-- It's untouched.

426
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,480
Our new home.

427
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:16,620
And it comes with a pool!

428
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,430
- Yodelay-yodelay-
yodelayheehoo

429
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,960
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!

430
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,910
Ha. Amateur.

431
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,310
Look out below!

432
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,260
- Not bad. But I don't get it.
Where's the herd?

433
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:57,660
Not to mention Neera.

434
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:00,170
They'll get here--

435
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,830
Soon enough.

436
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,540
Oh, no.

437
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,610
Eema?

438
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,550
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

439
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:19,110
That is the way
we used to get in here.

440
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,130
They'll never make it
over that.

441
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:31,860
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

442
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,800
Let him try.

443
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,610
[Eema] Mm. I hope Kron's
in a listening mood.

444
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,990
Stay here.

445
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,330
We'll find a way
around it.

446
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,200
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

447
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,000
We have to keep trying.

448
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:18,170
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

449
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,770
Now, let's go home!

450
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,280
You'll make it,
won't you, boys?

451
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,330
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!

452
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,920
If they can do it,
so can you!

453
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,670
[Aladar] Kron!

454
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,440
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!

455
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,150
- Keep moving!
- [Aladar] Stop!

456
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:05,020
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!

457
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,180
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

458
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,390
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight to the carnotaurs?

459
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,130
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

460
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:20,170
There's a sheer drop
on the other side!

461
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:25,900
You're gonna kill the herd! I know a way
to the valley, and everybody can make it!

462
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,570
Now, follow me!

463
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,310
Kron!

464
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,510
They're staying with me!

465
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,880
All right. Let's go!

466
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,250
Neera!

467
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,870
He's led that monster
right to us! This way!

468
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,210
No! Don't move!

469
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,370
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!.
Stand together!

470
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:10,190
Kron!

471
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,380
No.

472
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,000
[Neera] Kron.

473
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,890
Welcome home.

474
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,060
[Eema] Move over, everybody.
Bringing in babies is what I do best.

475
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,070
I'd say it's been a few years
since you've hatched an egg.

476
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,540
- You're right, so let me
practice on your head.

477
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,080
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.

478
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:52,320
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see?

479
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,360
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

480
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,520
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

481
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,600
[Eema] Ohh. Oh, happy day.

482
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
[Baylene] Well done, little one.

483
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,160
Come here, you little rascal.
Let me get a good look at you.

484
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,840
Yep. You're your father's son,
all right.

485
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,680
- [Zini] Hey!
Look what I found! New neighbors!

486
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,850
Any of you ladies up for a game
of "monkey in the middle"?

487
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,360
Easy, now! Easy! Hey!

488
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:23,670
None of us really know what changes,
big or small, lie ahead.

489
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,680
One thing is certain--
Our journey's not over.

490
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:32,190
We can only hope
that, in some small way...

491
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:35,420
our time here
will be remembered.

492
