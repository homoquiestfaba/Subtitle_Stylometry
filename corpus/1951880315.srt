You are so adorable!

90
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm gonna run to the little boys' room.

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,907
But when I come back,

92
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,919
I want to get to the bottom
of this "Boingo Boingo" business, okay?

93
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,090
Ah!

Look, here's what we're gonna do.

112
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,688
She comes down,

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,662
and the bathing-suit top has to stay on
so she can roll to hand it.

114
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,062
What we do is we
double-side tape.

115
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,033
Am I screwing up?

116
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,832
I mean, if I had another arm, I could...

117
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,736
They're just figuring some stuff out.

118
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,741
<i>Or she could go...

God, you'd think they were
solving world hunger.

120
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,202
It's much more important than that.

121
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,579
All right. We're gonna tie the top.

122
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,414
So I just made it to Manhattan,
so I'm still figuring it all out.

123
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,287
But I used to come here as a kid.

124
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,452
I'd beg my parents to take me here.

125
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,122
I'm just so happy to be here. Wow!

126
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,995
<i>Oh! This is great!

127
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,557

129
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,537

130
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,835
...about acting, you know? So I quit.

131
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,400
I was outta there.

132
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,969
<i>Intrigued by her.</i>

133
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,106
I kinda miss Tupac already.

134
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,548
I left him with my parents.

135
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,016
You want to see a picture?

136
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,349
Whoa!

137
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,856
Man, he's looking good.

138
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,256
Isn't he cute? Mwah!

139
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,924
Is this the place?

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,831
Home sweet home.

141
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,600
You know, these hostels
are riddled with bedbugs,

142
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,006
crabs, stuff like that.

143
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,771
Hey, listen, you're not...

144
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,472

145
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,843

That's, uh, that's my
bedroom over there,

154
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,906
and the extra bedroom
is right there.

155
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,438
There's a... bit of a view there.

That is not the question.

The question is how many, hmm?

168

Am I right?

169
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,181
Sally, let me guess.

170
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,776
You want a small family,

Gimme a break.

183
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,151
But now I know
there's more to it than that.

184
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,158
It's biological.

185

You want a coffee?

186
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,002
No thanks. I don't go there.

187
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,205
Why? What's wrong with it?

188
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,214
I try and buy fair trade coffee.

189

190
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,011

You heard of this, huh?

198
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,751
It eliminates the middleman.

199
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,689
Puts more money in
the hands of the grower.

200
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,919

201
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,894
<i>Of course.
Doesn't everybody?

202
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,190
If everybody knows about it,

203
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,891
how come everyone doesn't buy it?

204
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,830
Not everyone carries it, I guess.

205
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,893
Downstairs. They sell
fair-trade blend downstairs.

206
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,597
I don't think that's the same.

207
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,071
Why don't more
coffee shops carry it?

208
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,111
It's all about profits.

209
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,945
Internationally, coffee prices have fallen,
like, 80% in the last decade.

210
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,417
Does that low-fat cup of crap
gotten any cheaper?

211

Do you know where to get it?

212
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,921
Ask a hippie. They'll tell you.

- Hello.
- Hi.

222
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,153
Just a few questions.

223
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,385
1, why do you want to adopt this cat?

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,619
Excuse me?

Why do you want to adopt this cat?

226

Is that a trick question?

00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,930
No. No tricks.

228
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,162
Just a simple question
to get things rolling.

229
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,804
I like cats.

Yeah.

00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,701
Not the greatest.

363
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,033
What does that mean?

364
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,835
Ahem. Well, it means that...

365
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,274
I don't absorb nutrients
like most people.

366
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,278
So I have to eat a lot.

367
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,637
And that's it?

368
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,578
Um... no.

369
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,178
There's a pulmonary component.

370
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,815
My lungs are building up scar tissue,

371
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,655
which eventually...

372
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:43,700
But some people
live to be in their 40s.

373
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,729
So you're this hot chick,
and you've got cystic fibrosis.

374
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:54,404
Yes, but is there a rule that says
I have to be one thing?

375
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,478
Jack, have you ever thought
about getting a dog?

376
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,578
No.

377
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,986
Might lighten you up a bit,

378
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,389
get you out of the house,
meet other dog people.

379
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:11,555
The assumption here is that
I want to meet other people.

380
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,760
Jack?
Yeah.

381
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,028
Are you gay?

382
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,935
Yes, George. I'm gay.

383
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,202
No, because Sally
thinks maybe... maybe you're gay.

384
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,742
I just said I was.

385
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,402
No, you're not.

386
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,968
I just said I'm gay, George.

387
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,172
But you're not.

388
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,874
No.

389
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,814
Fine.

390
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:36,547
So Sally met this chick at yoga...

391
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:41,456
Hey, you remember that girl we hired
for the Klubendorff' commercial?

392
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,756
<i>Oh, she's hot, buddy.

393
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,626
You should take a run at that.

394
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,164
I've been there.

395
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,466
You've been there been there?

396
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,163
She's my roommate.

397
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,735
Hey, how long have
you known this chick?

398
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,175
'Cause I saw this episode
of the <i>X- Files</i> once

399
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,042
where this girl goes out
with all these different guys

400
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,880
and then she sells their
organs on the black market.

401
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,044
Then he started
asking me all these questions.

402
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,917
Like, am I good?

403
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,589
Uh... yeah.

404
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,125
Yeah, that did come up.

405
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,717
And?

406
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,758
Well...

407
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:24,530
I realized that I didn't have a lot
of answers for him.

408
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,197
I mean, I don't really know
that much about you.

409
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,941
Well, I come from an island.

410
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,947
It's called the island of heart,

411
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,813
and it's surrounded
by the sea of intuition.

412
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,251
Really?

413
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,289
The days are short,

414
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,052
and the nights are even shorter.

415
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,218
And every dawn, a fresh <i>breeze</i>

416
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,593
blows away the static thoughts
and the dead ideas.

417
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,225
Mmm. Nice.

418
00:23:56,301 --> 00:24:00,203
So I come from the planet Earth,

419
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,799
and my people are stubborn
and set in their ways.

420
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:08,574
<i>Our ideas don't just
float in on a breeze.

421
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,138
We plant them in the ground

422
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:16,449
and watch them grow
into big-ass trees with big-ass roots.

423
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,647
[chuckles]

424
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,088
I eat dreamers for breakfast.

425
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,490
[laughs] Yeah, right.

426
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,893
You drink your breakfast from a can.

427

Hey there.

00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,276
You in for a tune-up?

00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:25,384
I am.

How long have you been here?

447
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,225
Hey, is the room service any good?

448
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,131
How's the food?

449
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,669
Do they turn your bed down at night

450
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,228
and leave the chocolate on the pillow?

451
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,139
All the nice hotels do it.

452
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,302
Hey, Wyatt, just so you know,

453
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,903
the kid and I, we're gonna want our beds
turned down at night

454
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,845
and a chocolate on the pillow.

455
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,441
And I'll take a newspaper
with my breakfast.

456
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,748
Do you want a newspaper?

457
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,685

458
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,418
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,119
Hey, kid, you should look into that.

461
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,363
Yeah, right.

462
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,066
- So what's your name?
- Holly.

463
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,663
- Got a boyfriend?
- No.

464
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,435
No?

465
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,204
That's crazy.

466
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,508
A pretty girl like you?

467
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,981
I got a boyfriend.

468
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,540
He's cute.

469
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,085
Is he better than David Beckham?

470
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,986
- Um, that depends.
<i>- On</i> what?

471
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,422
If you like pretty boys with frosted hair.

472

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,697
Lame.

478
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,476
What?

479
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,982
Jill?

00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,793
Are you asleep?

00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,830
Uh-uh.

483
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,293
Do you ever think about dying?

484
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,999
Uh-uh.

485
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,935
What do you think about?

486
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:42,012
I think about wanting to learn as much
as I can while I'm here.

487
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,055
Making an impact.

488
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,151

490
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,930
You can't let them forget, Holly.

491
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,027
You gotta fight.

492
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,497
We gotta fight.

493
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,513

Jill didn't come home last night.

She didn't call.

497
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,192
No message.

498
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,496
Sound weird to you?

499
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,231
Well, if she's like, say, your girlfriend,

500
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,865
then yeah, that could be a little weird.

501
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,205
But she's just your roommate, right?

502
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,835

mix it up.

00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,316
We need a manifesto,
some rules to live by,

545
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,376
something to keep us on our toes.

546
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,757
What are you doing?

547
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,054
It's called holding hands.

548
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,861
It's something people do
to show affection.

549
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,128
Yeah, well, holding hands is...

550
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,361
<i>Overrated.

551
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,927
But you're doing it anyway.

552
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,335
Hello.

553
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,437
<i>- Be honest.</i>
- Jill?

554
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,914
Did you hear me?
I said be honest.

555
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,575
What are you talking about?

556
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,710
The manifesto.

557
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,051
Be honest.
It should be rule number 1.

558
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,489
Write it down.
<i>Okay.

559
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,493
Uh...

560
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,827
"Rule 1: Be honest."

561
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,197
Done.
Good.

562
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,293
Bye.
Uh...

563
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,907
She's hanging up on me.

564
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,671
I'm gonna start hanging up
on people.

565
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,941
# <i>Yeah, you do it 'cause he understands,</i>
<i>understands</i> #

566
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,881
# <i>Do it for the trouble</i> #

567
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,181
# <i>Yeah, you do it 'cause it's dark outside</i> #

568
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,254
Why are you so mean to this thing?

569
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,986
Time is a construct, Jill.

570
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,723
Some Roman dude took it upon himself
to measure shadows,

571
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,789
and then the rest of the world
is bound by these little ticks.

572
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,233
But is it accurate? Hmm?

573
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,464
When you're having fun, time flies, right?

574
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,405
But when you're stuck in traffic,
it stands still.

575
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,774
So is it infinite or completely limited?

576
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:38,407
It's both. But that piece of junk
just sits there and ticks.

577
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,577
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

578
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,416
It's like a... Chinese water torture.

579
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,889
Well, I wish it would just stand still.

580
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,449
It can't. Time is the enemy.

581
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,654
We age, we wrinkle, we die.

582
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,129
Anyone who tells you different
is living in a fairy tale.

583
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,395
Then let's live in a fairy tale.

584
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,898
I have to work.

585
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,168
<i>Okay. Rule 2: Believe in fairy tales.

586
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,765
Whoa! Did you just kiss me?

587
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,867
You just kissed me.

588
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,037
- No, I didn't.
- Well, then what was that?

589
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,707
That was a... peck.

590
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,047
[scoffs]
You're weird.

591
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,386
# <i>Yeah, you do it</i>
<i>'cause it's dark outside</i> #

592
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,091
# <i>Yeah, you do it</i>
<i>'cause you haven't tried</i> #

593
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,866
You seem happy.

594
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,070
- Happier... something.
- Do I?

595
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,340
Maybe it's Jill.

596
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,438
She's fun.

597
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:47,973
Young and fun.

598
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,213
And she doesn't want babies.

599
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,761
George...

600
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,388
let's do some pro bono.

601
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,898
Like Bono and The Edge bono?

602
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,867
This isn't painfully dull to you?

603
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,801
Let's take something on.

604
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,338
Coffee.

605
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,930
Fair trade coffee.

606
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,874
Let's do something for those guys.

607
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,641
I don't have time just to dream up
fantasy campaigns for fair trade coffee.

608
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,874
Why not, George?

609
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,780
Because, Jack, I'm not
Mr. Bachelor. I work hard.

610
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,944
And when I'm not working hard,
I'm spending time with my wife.

611
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,247
[scoffs]

612
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,152
Don't scoff at me.
You're not better than me.

613
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:28,056
I'm not saying I'm better than you.

614
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,425
Sweeties, it's showtime.

615
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,758
I wasn't saying I'm better.

616
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,128
Yes, you were.

617
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,929
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

618
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,596
Would you stop, please?

619
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,003
Doop used to be the hippest
hair jell out there.

620
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,168
I was using this product when I was
younger than both of you boys.

621
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,235
We've got to make Doop cool again.

622
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,574
We can do cool.

623
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,944
These guys are really cool.

624
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,677
Why don't you tell
Mr. Carlin what you have in mind?

625
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,921
Well, let's begin by acknowledging
that Doop is already cool.

626
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,620
We say let's keep the aesthetic.

627
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:07,790
It has integrity, history,
street credibility.

628
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,595
Let's look at some of the print
that used to move it off the shelves.

629
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,602
I don't know. It has to be hip.

630
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,138
What George is saying
is that Doop is already hip,

631
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,867
and the campaign
will simply reinforce that fact.

632
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,307
<i>Other products may
come and go, sir,

633
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,641
but Doop... Doop... Doop
has always been there.

634
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,010
Bring back the old ads, huh?

635
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,844
Why would I pay you for that?

636
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,818
The man's got a point.

637
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,745
Not the old ads exactly, sir.

638
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,518
We would, uh, feather the campaign.

639
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,059
We need a new, fresh campaign.

640
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:40,223
I want youngsters in clubs and malls
and on street corners

641
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,458
talking about Doop,

642
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,227
talking about how it
holds your hair just so.

643
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:47,032
I want blogs and podcasts and viral.

644
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,594
I wanna go viral.

645
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,642
Well, why don't Jack and George
draw up some proposals

646
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,006
and give you some options?

647
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:55,068
I want options!

648
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,882
<i>Okay, just a couple more questions.

649
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,582
How long have you guys
been together?

650
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,680
Is that a question from your list?

651
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,624
[chuckles]
Sir, it's up to me

652
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,355
to determine whether
this bunny is going

653
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,420
to a safe and supportive family.

654
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,431
You would be surprised
how many people

655
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,126
make stews out of these guys.

656
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,032
<i>Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

657
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,434
We have grandchildren.

658
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,371
- 15.
- 16.

659
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,170
<i>Oh, 16. That's right.

660
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,041
Wow. You're so lucky.

661
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,239
You guys have been
together a long time, huh?

662
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,043
47 years.

663
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,947
48.

664
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,714
48 years.

665
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,448
You're old.

666
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,452
You're old people.

667
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,589
That's neat. [sniffles]

668
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,757
Sweetie, is there something wrong?

669
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,926
Can I ask you a question?

670
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,402
What's your secret?

671
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,573
Well...

672
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,099
we've both learned
to hold our tongue over the years.

673
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,078
And...

674
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,241
the nookie's
always been good, hasn't it, dear?

675
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,586
How's it coming?

676
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,456
Anything good?

677
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,029
"Doop and do it.
A little Doop will do ya."

678
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,827
See, that's good.

679
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,164
Right? It's classic.

680
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,828
"Dive into the Doop."

681
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,134
That's not bad.

682
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,639
<i>Oh, this is good.

683
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:35,111
"Doop it and poop it.
Big Doop, bigger poop."

684
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,010
<i>Oh, and this one.

685
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,914
"Doopy Doopy do.
Who fucking cares?"

686
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,646
Great.
It's coming along nicely.

687
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,119
[clicks pen]

688
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,764
Here. Read this.

689
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,502
<i>Okay.

690
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,698
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

691
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,502
"that all men are created equal

692
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,566
"and that they are endowed
by their Creator

693
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,407
"with certain inalienable rights

694
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,381
that among these..." [coughs]

695
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,080
"...are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness."

696
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,644
Right.

697
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,815
So?

698
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,824
So it doesn't make sense.

699
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,156
You can't pursue happiness.

700
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,028
I mean, if it read you have the right
to pursue your dreams,

701
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,260
and God willing,
that makes you happy,

702
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,733
that I could buy.

703
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,030
Semantics.

704
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,664
No, no. No, no, no.
It's philosophy.

705
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,437
Happiness is intangible, an emotion.

706
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,102
You can't pursue it.

707
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,773
<i>Okay, so you're saying
that one of our core values is flawed?

708
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,942
That's exactly what I'm saying.

709
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,711
<i>Okay, so rule 6 would be...

710
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:57,318
Abandon the pursuit of happiness
and its false promise.

711
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,295
<i>Okay, read 'em back to me.

712
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,356
"Rule 1:

Be honest."

714
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,063
Good.

715
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,833
"2: Believe in fairy tales."

716
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:15,208
"Rule 3: Accept time as your friend

717
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,871
<i>Okay.

718
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,144
"Rule 4: Make sure the nookie's good."

719
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,647

00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,253
Why didn't you tell me?

904
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,552
It's early, first trimester.

905
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,786
You're not supposed
to say anything.

906
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,391
It's amazing.

907
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,769
You are going to be happy.

908
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,067
It was beautiful
when we sat in the twilight,

909
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,232
laying our plans.

910
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,367
You were gonna work in the world...

911
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,002
the living world.

912
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,639
The lone messenger
of emancipation...

913
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,477
Thank you, Jill.

914
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,578
You'll do fine.
Thanks for coming in.

915
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,314
When?

916
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,757
Excuse me?

917
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,954
Well, when am I gonna do fine?

918
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:42,624
'Cause it's been months
of these meetings, and nothing.

919
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:46,100
Sweetie, we're all asking that question.

920
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:50,629
You start at the bottom,
and then you claw your way up.

921
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,198
And claw my way up? Great.

922
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,473
You're new in town.
Give it some time.

923
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,052
Those two jokers
got the Doop campaign?

924
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,452
Yep.

925
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,363
Jack!

926
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,990
Jack!

927
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,193
Hey!

929
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,137

930
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,372
Hey, Jill.

931
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:33,280
What are you doing? You're so...

932
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,647
What's wrong with you?

933
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,117
What? Nothing happened.

934
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,448
That car just almost hit you!

935
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,352
Relax. It's no big deal.

936
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,821
It is a big deal.

937
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,483
It's a huge deal. It's your life.

938
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,356
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

939
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,554
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

940
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,257
Nothing's important to you.

941
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,629
- Jill, it's okay.
- No!

942
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,167
Here. I made you lunch.

943
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,635
I don't think it was... Jill, wait.

944
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,672
Jill, wait!

945
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:02,037
What the hell just happened?

946
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,456
Hey, George...

947
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:23,590
how does this relationship
nonsense usually work?

948
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,396
Usually, you go on a couple of dates,

949
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,958
see if you like each other.

950
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,504
Eventually you have sex.

951
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,039
Right. I, uh...

952
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,802
I sort of skipped the whole dating thing.

953
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,673
So what then?

954
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,336
And then, if you're
happy with the action,

955
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,176
you become boyfriend and girlfriend.

956
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,772
It's really fun for, like, three months,

957
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,874
and then you <i>realize</i> it's work.

958
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,386
Then you dump her.

959
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:45,921
<i>Or not.

960
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,081
<i>Okay, let's say not.

961
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,351
You move in together.

962
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,619
I did that.

963
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,819
Right.

964
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,921
Well...

965
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,693
Then you get married.

966
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,290
You start your trajectory of acquisitions.

967
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,268
Knives, forks, juicer, barbecue.

968
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,964
You move to the 'burbs. You buy a house.

969
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,165
You pop some kids out.

970
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,266
You fight, you cheat,
you separate, divorce,

971
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,436
you split the shit,
and see the kids on weekends.

972
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,038
Then you start all over again.

973
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,605
It all sounds so promising.

974
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,446
It's just an outline, Jack.

00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,043
She never left.

Waiting on a new set of lungs.

983
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,052
Decided on the transplant.

984
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,113
She's gonna be happy to see you.

985
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,889

00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,529

What kind of a name is Jack?

998
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,937
He sounds old.

999
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,603
It's a stupid name.

What makes you say that?

1003
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,514
Because everyone lies to me.

I'm not lying to you.

1083
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,691
[sighs]
I'm sick.

1084
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,320
What do you mean,
you're sick?

1085
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,462
I have cystic fibrosis.

1086
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,905
What? What?

1087
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,204
What... What... What is that?

1088
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:50,245
Well, it's...

1089
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,974
I have trouble breathing,

1090
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:55,347
and that's why
I'm constantly coughing and...

1091
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,319
That's why I eat like a freakin' pig
and I don't gain weight.

1092
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:02,222
See? It's not all that bad.
[laughs]

1093
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,090
How long have you had this?

1094
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,398
I was born with it.

1095
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,198
Is it...

1096
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,899
Is it fatal?

1097
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,181
Eventually.

1098
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,015
What is eventually?

1099
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:33,146
Like ten years or more or less.

1100
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:36,851
I mean, they're finding out
new things about it all the time.

1101
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,154
Come here.

1102
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,761
What is this?

1103
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,096
What does this say?
What the hell does that say?

1104
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,932
"Be honest."
It's rule 1!

1105
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,494
Damn it!

1106
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,268

Hey!

1133
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,406
Hi!

1134
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:13,709
I got more crap.

1135
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:18,686
Let's see, I got Doritos.

1136
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:21,154
I got Ben and Jerry's.

1137
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,022
Hey, look. They got a new flavor:
Couch Potato.

1138
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,856
[coughs]

1139
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,259
You didn't think that was funny?

1140
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,389
Couch potato?

1141
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,990
Take it back to the joke factory?

1142
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,002
<i>Okay.

1143
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:45,147
What are you gonna do, babe?

1144
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,977
I'm gonna go home.

1145
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,244
Home, huh?

1146
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,617
What about your career?

1147
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:55,418
What career?

1148
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,425
I'm a Klubendorff' girl.

1149
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,654
Come on.

1150
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,321
You're doing your thing.

1151
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,762
And you've got friends.

1152
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,699
I mean, I'm not gonna
tickle your toes or anything,

1153
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,258
but I'm here for you.

1154
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:12,569
I just need to take
a step back and... reevaluate.

1155
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,803
Reevaluate, huh?

1156
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:19,839
<i>Okay.

1157
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,009
Here.

1158
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,212
Reevaluate this.

1159
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,687
What are you doing?

1160
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:32,091
- Come on.
<i>- Oh, my God, Lucy! What are you doing?

1161
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,753
You gotta let it out!

1162
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,560
I can't believe you right now!

1163
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,398
[dog barking]

1164
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,335
[crying]

1165
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,840
I don't want to be sick anymore.

1166
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,937
[crying]

1167
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,087
Come on.

1168
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,491
I don't want to be sick anymore.

1169
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,326
So that's where she's been hiding.

1170
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,565
Can you die from it?

1171
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,335
Apparently.

1172
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,569
Yeah, 30's, like, old.

1173
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,774
It's a raw deal, my friend. I'm sorry.

1174
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,013
What are you gonna do?

1175
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,618
I don't know, man.

1176
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,181
What are you gonna do?

1177
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,295
What?

1178
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,298
I'm not gonna do anything.

1179
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:47,700
She lied to me, George,
and that was rule number 1: No lies.

1180
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,862
So she lied.

1181
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,565
Do I look like Florence Nightingale?

1182
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:51,833
You're an asshole.

1183
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:55,399
You're dumping her 'cause she's sick?

1184
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,876
She'll get over it.

1185
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,083
It's not her I'm worried about.

1186
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,280
The girl made you happy.

1187
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,264
<i>Oh! What the...

1188
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,238
<i>Oh, come on!

1189
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:35,078
So I went to my truck
this morning,

1190
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,245
and someone had stuck a sticker
right over the gas tank.

1191
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,344
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

1192
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,185
Guess what it said.

1193
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,454
"One nuclear bomb
ruins your whole day"?

1194
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,721
It said "Stupid."

1195
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:49,561
Just..."Stupid."

1196
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:55,400
Somebody... thinks
your truck is stupid, obviously.

1197
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,007
I'm gonna bring in the client
and make a recommendation.

1198
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,702
G-R-E-A-T.

1199
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,108
- Excuse me?
- Great.

1200
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,079
Like... whoopee.

1201
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,638
If you don't like your job, quit.

1202
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,913
If you don't like my work, fire me.

1203
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:12,851
You know, it's always
more pleasant for everyone

1204
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,356
if you make the appearance
of liking your job.

1205
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:18,587
I just conceptualized
a commercial for pre-laid carpet.

1206
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,459
So just how excited
would you like me to be?

1207
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:26,123
<i>Okay, so you guys
are at an amusement park,

1208
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:27,863
and you're all having a great time,

1209
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,498
roller coasters, cotton candy,
the whole <i>shibui.</i>

1210
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:35,510
Except one of you has your period.

1211
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,978
Now, which one of you
wants to have your period?

1212
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,742
<i>- Oh, I will.
- I will.

1213
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,612
<i>Okay, you. Fantastic.

1214
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,878
So you have your period,

1215
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,147
and you guys are,
like, her best friends,

1216
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,745
and you know about this new tampon

1217
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,188
that's completely discreet
and totally comfortable,

1218
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,557
and you, like, school her
on how cool this new tampon is.

1219
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,823
So I want you to improvise
a little scene,

1220
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,455
and don't stop until I say.

1221
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,558
<i>Okay? All right. Go ahead.

1222
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,330
<i>Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited.

1223
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,200
It's the Humper Bumper.

1224
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,240
<i>Oh! I want to go, but l...

1225
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,672
What? What, what, what?

1226
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,300
- My period.
- No way!

1227
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,503
I feel really bloated.

1228
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:10,602
What are you using?

1229
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,579
- Pads, but...
- You're not!

1230
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,740
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

1231
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,374
I'm gonna have to stop you there.

1232
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,885
Uh, hello.

1233
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,581
Is there a problem?

1234
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,521
Is it just me,
or is this really, really stupid?

1235
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,027
[gasps]

1236
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,027
Good luck.

1237
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,730
Wow.

1238
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,328
Meow.

1239
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,533
Anyway, uh, sorry to interrupt you.

1240
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,009
So, uh, new tampon and...

1241
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,410
Ferris wheel, roller coasters... go.

1242
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,510
It's over?

1243
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,448
Sorry to hear that, son.

1244
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,149
Don't... Don't do that.

1245
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,248
What?

1246
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,987
Don't "son" me.

1247
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,120
What should I call you, then?

1248
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,256
I don't know.

1249
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,890
How about my name?

1250
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,300
Jackson Randall Forthright.

1251
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,671
Randall was your mother's idea.

1252
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,074
I never cared for the name, but...

1253
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:18,739
I wanted to make
your mother happy.

1254
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,318
That's all I ever wanted was to...

1255
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,116

Look, if you want
to talk to her, call her.

1302
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,543
Do you want
to answer the question?

1304
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,780

Why do you want to adopt a dog?

1306
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:49,788
Why didn't she tell me?

1307
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,120
She did.

1308
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:52,683
Sooner.

1309
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,924
She tells people she's sick,

1310
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,024
and that's all they see.

1311
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,296
I guess she wanted to come first.

1312
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:06,330
She thought if she'd tell you,
you'd leave.

1313
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,137
Weird, huh?

1314

If you tell me she doesn't love me...

1318
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,821
then I'll leave her alone.

01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:33,066
<i>After all, it's rule number 1.</i>

1433
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,423
# <i>We are here to take the blame</i> #

1434
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,690
# <i>To take the taunts and lift the shame</i> #

1435
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,288
# <i>We are here to make you feel</i> #

1436
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:00,300
# <i>It terrifies you, but its real</i> #

1437
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,996
# <i>It will keep you up all night</i> #

1438
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,869
# <i>And in the flood of morning light</i> #

1439
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,738
# <i>Spilling out across your room</i> #

1440
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,506
# <i>You say the words will get there soon</i> #

1441
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:11,205
# <i>The revolution wasn't bad</i> #

1442
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:14,207
# <i>We hit the streets with all we had</i> #

1443
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,005
# <i>A tape recording of the sound</i> #

1444
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:19,842
# <i>Of the Velvet Underground</i> #

1445
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:22,974
# <i>A K-Way jacket torn to shreds</i> #

1446
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,645
# <i>And a dream inside our heads</i> #

1447
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,450
# <i>And after changing everything</i> #

1448
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:31,515
# <i>They couldn't tell we couldn't sing</i> #

1449
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:34,084

1450

1451

# <i>They couldn't tell we couldn't sing</i> #

1452
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,565
# <i>And that changes everything</i> #

1453
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,255
# <i>I am a robot</i> #

1454
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:08,955
# <i>Among the millions of robots</i> #

1455
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:13,831
# <i>I eat my sugar and watch my TV</i> #

1456
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,063
# <i>Lots and lots</i> #

1457
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,368
# <i>Without caffeine,</i>
<i>I can get pretty mean</i> #

1458
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:25,139
# <i>Talk shows, new clothes</i>
<i>are my vitamins</i> #

1459
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:28,410
# <i>Advertisements lead me to</i> #

1460
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,781
# <i>The promised land</i> #

1461
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:40,021
# <i>Money-hungry corporations</i> #

1462
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:45,930
# <i>Agents of eternal disintegration</i> #

1463
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,068
# <i>Come on</i> #

1464
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:57,009
# <i>I miss the good old days when</i> #

1465
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:00,809
# <i>The government was our friend</i> #

1466
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:04,511
# <i>And we can get there again</i> #

1467
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,007
# <i>If we feel our feelings</i> #
