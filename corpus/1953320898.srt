00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,812
<i>Frank:
Whoo! Emilio!</i>

341
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,855
Meet me at the ring, T.

342
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:13,798
<i>Emilio!</i>

343
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,132
What?

344
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:19,137
<i>You're gonna burn yourself out.
Come on.</i>

345
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,975
<i>Mr. T's tired.
Let's go.</i>

346
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,580
Burn myself out? You been telling
me that since I was a little kid.

347
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,867
<i>True.</i>

348
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,872
I feel good.

349
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,909
- I look good.
- All right.

350
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,221
- All right, all right.
- I feel good.

351
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,623
♪ I don't know
what you been told ♪

352
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:45,827
- ♪ Uncle Frank... ♪
- Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

353
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,349
You got a fight tonight.
Nice and easy.

354
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,241
Pace yourself.
That's right.

355
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,048
That's right.

356
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:56,186
What time did you get in
this morning?

357
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,658
Around 5:00.

358
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,762
Couldn't sleep again?

359
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,635
Um, nah, man.
I just want to be ready.

360
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,842
I got energy. I want to be
ready for tonight, baby.

361
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,711
You'll never be ready, kid.

362
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:09,113
Oh, Ben, what's up, man?

363
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,287
When are you gonna
start promoting me?

364
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,989
Hey.

365
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,892
I cannot promote anybody
from jail.

366
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:16,632
I don't even have that pull.

367
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,121
( Both speaking Spanish )

368
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

369
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,261
- I'm Emilio.
- I'm Kristina.

370
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,165
- Kristina?
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,971
Oh.

372
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,111
<i>Ben: I heard you're
sleeping here now.</i>

373
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,716
I'm saving money on gas.

374
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,854
You need some money.

375
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,096
No no no, I'm good.
I'm good.

376
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:48,835
Okay, Frankie.
Talk to me. What's up?

377
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:51,141
I need a favor.

378
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:54,147
Sure.
You're like my brother.

379
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,754
- It's about Emilio.
- No.

380
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,990
You just said that
I'm like your brother,

381
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,761
that just ask,
that whatever I need...

382
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,132
<i>- no, I can't.
- Why not?</i>

383
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,079
Because of that.

384
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,815
He just has a lot of energy.

385
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,855
He's unfocused. He's all over the place.
He's like a wild horse.

386
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,361
Is that why your fighters
are afraid of fighting him?

387
00:21:15,362 --> 00:21:17,665
I am not going
to promote Emilio.

388
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,203
I'm not asking you
to promote him.

389
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:21,365
Then what?

390
00:21:46,365 --> 00:21:48,775
( Exhaling )

391
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,209
You know what your problem is?

392
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,080
What's my problem
this time, Talia?

393
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,220
You need to stop copying
every boxer you know

394
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:58,959
and start making
your own style.

395
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,129
Look, if you're going
to do Ali's jab,

396
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,132
at least do it right, okay?
He would twist his wrists

397
00:22:03,133 --> 00:22:04,737
<i>as he would make contact.</i>

398
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,643
Also you need to stop
leading with your head, okay?

399
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:11,052
You're not Arturo Gatti.
He had a jaw made of granite.

400
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,266
And you have a pretty face,
so try and protect it.

401
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,069
Anything else?

402
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,975
Not at the moment,
but I see some improvement.

403
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,247
Tell that to your pops.

404
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:25,220
Yeah, he's focused on Teddy.

405
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,226
Hey, Talia,
what are you doing here?

406
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,161
<i>- Dad, I'm working.
- Working?</i>

407
00:22:31,162 --> 00:22:33,336
- Yeah.
- You need a ride home?

408
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,139
- No.
- All right.

409
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,300
<i>Let's go shopping then, girl.</i>

410
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,716
- Okay, so you got that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:42,288
So I was going to ask you,
what are you doing Friday night?

412
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:45,895
'Cause I... I, um...
I like your fa...

413
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,168
your fashion now.
It changes...

414
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,411
I knew it. Nope.
I didn't mean it.

415
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:55,423
( Sighs ) That was so dumb.

416
00:22:57,423 --> 00:23:00,060
What?
What are you looking at?

417
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:03,836
Don't do all that. Don't look
at me all like that, okay?

418
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:06,709
I got game.
You know how I get.

419
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,050
Come... come on, T.

420
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,756
<i>Manny: You mean the big black
guy with all the chains?</i>

421
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,193
No no no,
Mr. T is my dog.

422
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,463
He's a pit bull.

423
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:19,369
I had him since I was a little kid.
He's like my best friend.

424
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,409
Damn, Manny,
I trust him with my life.

425
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,944
Why's that?

426
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,748
Because I can relate to him.

427
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:26,952
I hate how people
look down at pit bulls

428
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,791
just 'cause of the way
they look.

429
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:32,031
You know what I mean?
I hate that shit.

430
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:34,803
I want to start an organization
called peace for pit bulls,

431
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,874
like, whenever I start
getting money and shit.

432
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,247
You know, helping out pits.

433
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,451
And, uh, I just hate it

434
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:44,158
that every time someone looks
at a pit bull, they judge them.

435
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,294
You know what I mean?

436
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,298
( Laughs )
How do you think I feel?

437
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,575
You should start an
organization: Peace for Manny.

438
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:51,842
( Both laugh )

439
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,882
I try to keep a smile all day.

440
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:57,322
And by the end of the day,
my face hurts.

441
00:23:57,323 --> 00:24:00,469
Sometimes it's hard
to smile, huh, Manny?

442
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:05,339
Oh, fuck.

443
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,980
Hey, Manny, I'm not feeling
so good right now again.

444
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:13,356
I'm feeling a little...
I'm feeling a little shaky.

445
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:15,901
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

446
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,073
Can we get a TV up in here
or something like that?

447
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:22,877
Anything to just
take my mind off this.

448
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,890
I can make that happen.

449
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,927
<i>( Birds singing )</i>

450
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,198
( Sighs )

451
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,200
It's not that easy.

452
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,838
You could just walk up
to any bitch and hump her.

453
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,411
It's not like that in real life...
you gotta wine and dine 'em.

454
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,850
And then when you go up
to a girl, what do you say?

455
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:43,191
You know, and then you
have to have pick-up lines.

456
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,626
T, are you listening?

457
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:47,400
This is human world.
Do you know what I mean?

458
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:51,997
You just don't walk up
to girls and pick...

459
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:02,431
hey.

460
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:03,606
Hi.

461
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:08,380
You come here often?

462
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,614
It's the bus stop.

463
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,261
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

464
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,466
<i>- Cute dog.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

465
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:18,602
What's his name?

466
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:20,605
Mr. T.
He's my little brother.

467
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,012
Yeah, he's...
I'm... I'm...

468
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:26,886
I'm the fighter.
He's actually the lover.

469
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,423
He's cute.
( Laughs )

470
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:30,928
- I'm cute? Oh, he's cute!
- He's cute.

471
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:31,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:35,348
Born and raised in Dade county.
( Laughs )

473
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:43,028
( Stammering ) You know the
difference between a dog and a wife?

474
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:48,233
If... if you lock up,
um, your dog

475
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:49,194
and your wife in a trunk

476
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,975
and you let 'em out
an hour later,

477
00:25:51,976 --> 00:25:53,446
guess who's happy to see you?

478
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,414
<i>- Is that the bus?
- Yeah.</i>

479
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,353
Hey, there she is,

480
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:14,393
all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
ready to take on the world.

481
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:15,495
Morning, dad.

482
00:26:15,496 --> 00:26:17,665
Can I talk to you for a minute?

483
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,705
You've been like a busy bee lately.
What are you up to?

484
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:23,478
I... I've had a couple
of meetings lately.

485
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:25,549
You know, if I'm going
to be a female boxing promoter,

486
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,721
<i>I've got to work twice as hard.</i>

487
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:30,395
Benjamin, you said you were
taking me shopping today.

488
00:26:30,396 --> 00:26:32,466
Okay, honey, go get ready.

489
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,704
<i>I'd like to buy that dress
I've been telling you about.</i>

490
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:36,541
It's awesome.

491
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,580
Can I, like, talk to my dad
for, like, one second?

492
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:41,420
<i>Maybe, like someday?
I don't know.</i>

493
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,089
Okay.

494
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,432
<i>Talia: Dad, when are you
going to get rid of her?</i>

495
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,367
I don't know.

496
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:50,241
I like her.

497
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,509
What about you?

498
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,516
When are you going
to get rid of him?

499
00:26:54,517 --> 00:26:56,286
Who?

500
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:57,688
Emilio.

501
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:00,094
- What?
- Are you banging him?

502
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,666
- Dad!
- Eh, it's all good.

503
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,201
<i>He's a good-looking kid.</i>

504
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:05,738
<i>You know I don't
give you too much shit</i>

505
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:07,476
<i>about the guys you go out with.</i>

506
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:09,514
Just don't keep him around
too long, that's all.

507
00:27:09,515 --> 00:27:11,450
Have your fun and then move on.

508
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:13,491
I'm not interested
in him like that.

509
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:15,260
Then what?

510
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,502
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

511
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,506
I'm not going to promote him.

512
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:21,780
I know that.

513
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,184
So you had a meeting
with Frank.

514
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:27,488
Yes, I did.

515
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,727
Great.
What did he say?

516
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:31,563
He said you were going
to help him,

517
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:33,469
try to get Emilio
into golden gloves.

518
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,374
- Yeah.
- So what happened?

519
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:39,548
The boxing commissioner wants
nothing to do with him.

520
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,553
They say maybe next year.

521
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,657
So you're telling me
one of the most well-connected

522
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:45,693
boxing promoters in South
Florida couldn't get him in?

523
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:47,835
- Sweetie, stop stop stop.
- Come on.

524
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:50,772
Emilio is not my priority.

<i>- I tried.
- Did you? Did you really?</i>

526
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,519
Because, I don't know, I feel
like maybe you're scared

527
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,457
that if Emilio qualifies,

528
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:00,660
he's going to take
the spotlight away from Teddy.

529
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,599
Are you comparing Teddy
now with Emilio?

530
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,241
I don't feel safe having that kid
in the same ring with Teddy.

531
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:07,477
He will kill him.

532
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,580
I guess we're just going
to have to find out.

533
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:13,157
Because I'm promoting Emilio and I'm
getting him into golden gloves.

No, stop.

I'm chaperone, making sure
Teddy stays out of trouble.

That's the issue.

01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:44,755
Well, if you don't want her,
we'll keep her.

1190
01:03:44,756 --> 01:03:47,163
<i>No no no, you kept her
for a week, okay?</i>

1191
01:03:47,164 --> 01:03:49,232
Now she's all mine.

1192
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,903
Okay. Well bye, Daisy.
Take care.

1193
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:52,173
- Bye bye.
- Bye now.

1194
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:53,514
Thank you.

1195
01:03:55,514 --> 01:03:57,418
I didn't know you could cook.

1196
01:03:57,419 --> 01:03:59,321
<i>It's my specialty, vieja.</i>

1197
01:03:59,322 --> 01:04:00,027
Are you hungry?

1198
01:04:01,027 --> 01:04:05,136
Yeah, I'm hungry after all
that food in the hospital.

1199
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:07,306
It's so bad.

1200
01:04:07,307 --> 01:04:10,887
<i>Ay dios...
Where's Emilio?</i>

1201
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:14,458
Frank?

1202
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,369
Where's Emilio?

1203
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:22,445
Frankie?

1204
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:26,450
What happened?

1205
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:28,520
<i>¿Que Paso?</i>

1206
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:31,526
<i>Mami, Emilio tried
to commit suicide.</i>

1207
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:33,899
<i>¿Que? No.</i>

1208
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,770
<i>Mi Emilio, no.</i>

1209
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,108
<i>- Mami, please.
- No. Where is he? Where is he?</i>

1210
01:04:38,109 --> 01:04:40,246
<i>- Tell me where he is right now.
- Mami.</i>

1211
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:42,516
He's at the South Miami
psychiatric hospital.

1212
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:45,055
Take me there right now.
Take me there right now.

1213
01:04:45,056 --> 01:04:47,394
<i>- Take me there right now.
- Mami, mami, we can't go.</i>

1214
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:49,467
We can't go. They're holding
him for 14 days, okay?

1215
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:53,442
<i>- We'll go get him on Friday.
- Ay, dios mío...</i>

1216
01:04:53,443 --> 01:04:55,346
<i>It's gonna be okay, mami.</i>

1217
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:56,468
<i>Mami, it's going to be okay.</i>

1218
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,456
All right, so you want...
all right, how do we do...

1219
01:05:45,457 --> 01:05:48,331
paper, rock, scissors.
Okay, so you do it three?

1220
01:05:48,332 --> 01:05:50,201
Paper, rock, scissor.

1221
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:52,138
Paper, rock, scissor.

1222
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:53,375
Damn.

1223
01:05:53,376 --> 01:05:55,948
Paper, rock, scissor.
Oh, I got you.

1224
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:58,453
- Hey, what's that? Bam!
- Oh!

1225
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,991
Come on, man, you're a boxer.

1226
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:02,929
You're a boxer
and you go for that?

1227
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,331
That's a cheap shot, man.

1228
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:06,371
My Uncle does
the same thing, Manny.

1229
01:06:06,372 --> 01:06:07,506
( Laughing )

1230
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:09,579
Wait up, have you ever
wondered about this?

1231
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,317
How does...
how does paper beat rock?

1232
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:14,487
- You could just...
- Well, it covers it.

1233
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:16,325
Paper covers it.
You know what I mean?

1234
01:06:16,326 --> 01:06:19,633
It's kind of like boxing.
You swarm over somebody.

1235
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:22,371
You clinch them up,
they can't really hit you.

1236
01:06:22,372 --> 01:06:23,876
You told me
you used to box, right?

1237
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:25,914
Yeah yeah, a long time.
Yeah.

1238
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,650
- How was it?
- It was tough.

1239
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,420
A tough way to make a living.

1240
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:32,367
You know what I mean? But
sometimes that's all you got.

1241
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,405
<i>Doctor: Everybody
just take your seats.</i>

1242
01:06:36,406 --> 01:06:38,475
Is the mother here?

1243
01:06:38,476 --> 01:06:41,080
We are his mother...
his family.

1244
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,385
Okay, well,
thank you for coming.

1245
01:06:43,386 --> 01:06:46,427
It's important that everyone
who's close to Emilio

1246
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:50,435
and part of his life
be part of his treatment.

1247
01:06:50,436 --> 01:06:52,975
Treatment?

1248
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:56,381
Emilio has been diagnosed
with bipolar ii,

1249
01:06:56,382 --> 01:06:58,053
with suicidal ideation.

1250
01:06:58,054 --> 01:07:00,692
But the good news is
it's treatable.

1251
01:07:00,693 --> 01:07:02,529
<i>And Emilio's a good kid.</i>

1252
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,400
<i>He'll just need your love and
support to get through it.</i>

1253
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,507
Now I'm going to up
the dosage of lithium

1254
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:10,446
and that'll help
control the mood swings.

1255
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,286
And Manny here will
continue his counseling

1256
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:14,693
and monitor his progress.

1257
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:17,160
Him?

1258
01:07:17,161 --> 01:07:18,497
<i>Si, senora.</i>

1259
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:20,234
<i>( P.A. Beeps )</i>

1260
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:21,704
<i>( Indistinct talking
over p.A. )</i>

1261
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:24,510
And just so you're aware,
bipolar ii is a disorder

1262
01:07:24,511 --> 01:07:27,021
that manifests itself
with periods of insomnia,

1263
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:31,459
<i>anxiety, high stress,
manic states.</i>

1264
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,501
<i>Be very sure he doesn't miss any
of his scheduled medications.</i>

1265
01:07:35,502 --> 01:07:36,972
<i>And I'll keep an eye on him,</i>

1266
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:39,608
<i>check back in with you
guys every 30 days.</i>

1267
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:56,047
<i>Woman over p.A.: Mr. Portillo,
your 1:00 is here.</i>

1268
01:07:56,048 --> 01:07:58,120
Grace, who's my 1:00?

1269
01:07:58,121 --> 01:08:00,124
<i>A rep from T promotions?</i>

1270
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:02,630
<i>They have a fighter
they want you to see.</i>

1271
01:08:02,631 --> 01:08:06,538
I don'T know anyone from T promotions.
Send them away.

1272
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,282
<i>She's a female.</i>

1273
01:08:11,282 --> 01:08:12,651
Is she attractive?

1274
01:08:12,652 --> 01:08:14,726
<i>Yes.</i>

1275
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,385
Send her in.

1276
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:30,491
Hello, Mr. Portillo.
I'm Talia Portillo.

1277
01:08:30,492 --> 01:08:32,497
I'm the president
of T promotions.

1278
01:08:32,498 --> 01:08:35,202
What can I do for you,
miss Portillo?

1279
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:37,373
Well, I have the best boxer
in Miami Dade,

1280
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:39,610
and I want him to fight
the golden gloves champion

1281
01:08:39,611 --> 01:08:42,217
in an exhibition to help raise
money for Frank's boxing gym.

1282
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,124
Well, miss Portillo,

1283
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:47,728
your proposition
is very interesting.

1284
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:51,737
But we're not interested
in saving a fledgling boxing gym

1285
01:08:51,738 --> 01:08:54,082
or fighting a boxer
with suicidal tendencies.

1286
01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:58,419
I could have beat that guy
that fought Teddy, okay?

1287
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,522
<i>That doesn't matter.</i>

1288
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:01,526
Golden gloves
says he's the best

1289
01:09:01,527 --> 01:09:03,563
and now we're moving
to junior Olympics.

1290
01:09:03,564 --> 01:09:05,401
- I can't believe you're...
- The answer is no.

1291
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:07,506
- You're not even letting me finish.
- Talia.

1292
01:09:07,507 --> 01:09:09,778
You are irritating me.

1293
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,682
<i>I don't want to talk
about this anymore.</i>

1294
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:14,523
There's no way Teddy
is going to fight Emilio.

1295
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:17,327
So for now,

1296
01:09:17,328 --> 01:09:19,783
have a good day.

1297
01:10:11,783 --> 01:10:14,756
<i>Frank:
Ah, there he is!</i>

1298
01:10:14,757 --> 01:10:15,892
<i>¿Que pasa?</i>

1299
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:17,630
It's great to have you here.

1300
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,639
So how do you feel?

1301
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:23,308
( Subdued ) Great.

1302
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:25,813
What have you been up to?

1303
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:28,286
Uh, sleeping.

1304
01:10:28,287 --> 01:10:30,537
Hey, you want to train?

1305
01:10:35,537 --> 01:10:38,408
<i>Tio, where's, um...</i>

1306
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:40,881
where's... ( Kisses )
Where's Mr. T?

1307
01:10:40,882 --> 01:10:42,852
Oh, Mr. T?
Talia took him.

1308
01:10:42,853 --> 01:10:44,255
Why?

1309
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:47,326
'Cause he wouldn't
stop crying since, you know,

1310
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,802
and he ate my shoes. And he was
barking at the people in the gym.

1311
01:10:50,803 --> 01:10:53,842
Uh, you didn't tell him
anything, right? About...

1312
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:55,484
nah, I didn't tell him.
I didn't tell him.

1313
01:10:56,015 --> 01:10:57,884
He also ate some
of my new equipment,

1314
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,859
- so Talia came by and took him.
- Probably didn't feel good.

1315
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,828
He did once he saw Talia.

1316
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:04,900
I don't know,
but I think he's in love.

1317
01:11:04,901 --> 01:11:06,974
He might be trying
to steal your girl.

1318
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:09,545
Well, she's not my girl.

1319
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:11,314
That's not what I heard.

1320
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:13,354
He said that if you don't
make your move fast,

1321
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:14,788
he's gonna take her.

1322
01:11:14,789 --> 01:11:17,701
Ah!
Did I see a smile?

1323
01:11:19,701 --> 01:11:22,339
- Oh! Hey, T!
- Hey.

1324
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,844
Hey, bud!
Hi!

1325
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:28,524
Hi!
( Making playful sounds )

1326
01:11:30,524 --> 01:11:32,403
Good boy!
Go over there.

1327
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:38,977
- Hey.
- That's all I get? "Hey"?

1328
01:11:38,978 --> 01:11:42,930
Guys, let's...

1329
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,934
You look good.

1330
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:52,844
Yeah.

1331
01:11:53,844 --> 01:11:55,854
Where's my bag?

1332
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:00,596
What's going on?

1333
01:12:02,596 --> 01:12:03,931
( Sighs )

1334
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:07,305
Just, uh, packing up my stuff.

1335
01:12:07,306 --> 01:12:09,644
Why?

1336
01:12:09,645 --> 01:12:11,849
'Cause I'm done, okay?

1337
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:13,987
You're quitting?

1338
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:16,662
Yeah, I'm quitting. I'm quitting,
if that's what you want to call it.

1339
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:18,837
I'm quitting.

1340
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,847
Okay, what do you want to do?

1341
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:28,719
I don't know.

1342
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,393
<i>I think I'm gonna get a job,</i>

1343
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:33,630
help my grandma out.

1344
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,101
I'm tired of being broke.

1345
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:37,715
What kind of job
do you want to get?

1346
01:12:40,715 --> 01:12:44,389
Something legit,
like a real job.

1347
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,993
I was thinking like Wendy's

1348
01:12:46,994 --> 01:12:48,997
or burger king.

1349
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:51,135
Burger king has a good
pension plan, so that's...

1350
01:12:51,136 --> 01:12:53,476
yeah no, yeah.
If those don't work out,

1351
01:12:53,477 --> 01:12:56,950
you could sell girl scout
cookies or something.

1352
01:12:56,951 --> 01:13:00,630
You could, like, wear the outfit,
like a beret and badges.

1353
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,633
Do you want me to help you?

1354
01:13:04,634 --> 01:13:06,470
No.

1355
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,921
No, I don't need
your help. I'm good.

1356
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:18,732
I'm gonna take, um, Mr. T to my
mom's house for a couple days

1357
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:21,403
so I can figure things out,
you know?

1358
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:22,164
Do you need a ride?

1359
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:26,621
No. I'm good.
I'm gonna walk.

1360
01:13:28,621 --> 01:13:30,757
I wanted to thank you
for taking care of Mr. T.

1361

I just wanted to let you know
that I appreciate that.

Oh yeah, it was...
it was no problem.

Actually, he was the one
that was taking care of me.

1364
01:13:41,114 --> 01:13:44,054
He told me to tell you

1365
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:46,627
that he knows things
are really tough right now,

1366
01:13:46,628 --> 01:13:49,706
but that they're going
to get better.

1367

That was just something
that he said to me.

01:25:02,595 --> 01:25:04,732
Tomas finally got
what was coming to him.

1528
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:06,937
There was an argument
over a dime bag.

1529
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:09,618
Only this time he got stabbed
in the face and neck.

1530
01:25:12,618 --> 01:25:15,356
Frank, is everything
all right with Emilio?

1531
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:18,545
Yeah, everything's great.

1532
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:41,091
<i>( Frank sighs )</i>

1533
01:25:46,091 --> 01:25:47,461
Hey, champ.

1534
01:25:47,462 --> 01:25:49,566
What's going on?

1535
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:51,610
( Groans )

1536
01:25:54,610 --> 01:25:56,814
Mr. T's going
to be okay.

1537
01:25:56,815 --> 01:25:58,961
He's a tough boy.

1538
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:04,470
I went there to kill him.

1539
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,747
But you didn't.

1540
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:13,786
Right after I won the title,

1541
01:26:13,787 --> 01:26:16,396
I had everything...
money, fame.

1542
01:26:18,396 --> 01:26:21,103
On your grandmother's birthday,

1543
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:23,674
we were going to take her
out to celebrate.

1544
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:26,047
<i>So I went by your mom's
house to pick her up.</i>

1545
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,654
And I see a bunch
of people standing outside.

1546
01:26:29,655 --> 01:26:32,527
And I hear her screaming.

1547
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:34,970
So I rushed in.

1548
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:38,508
And I find your mama
all bloodied up

1549
01:26:38,509 --> 01:26:40,946
and her boyfriend
just standing there.

1550
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:42,018
And I went at him.

1551
01:26:43,018 --> 01:26:46,862
I started hitting him
and hitting him.

1552
01:26:47,862 --> 01:26:50,702
<i>All my training,
all my dedication</i>

1553

1554
01:26:52,104 --> 01:26:54,676
<i>I lost myself that night.</i>

1555
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:57,855
And everything I had
was taken away from me.

1556
01:26:59,855 --> 01:27:02,961
<i>Look, I can't tell you
what to do.</i>

1557
01:27:02,962 --> 01:27:05,867
But whatever you do
decide to do,

1558
01:27:05,868 --> 01:27:07,973
you do it for yourself.

1559
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:09,778
You don't do it for your mom

1560
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:12,549
or for your grandma
or even for me,

1561
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:13,231
but for yourself.

1562
01:27:17,127 --> 01:27:19,090
You're gonna be okay.

1563

<i>( Crowd chattering )</i>

1564

( Overlapping conversations )

1565
01:27:41,948 --> 01:27:44,955
Hey, can you take this?

1566
01:27:44,956 --> 01:27:46,961
Where do you want me
to take it to?

1567
01:27:46,962 --> 01:27:48,831
Aren't you a coat check?

1568
01:27:48,832 --> 01:27:50,601
What's a coat check look like?

1569
01:27:50,602 --> 01:27:53,539
Well, just like you.

1570
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:09,808
<i>Emilio: You told me you
used to box, right, Manny?</i>

1571
01:28:09,809 --> 01:28:11,813
<i>- Manny: Yeah yeah, long time.
- How was it?</i>

1572
01:28:11,814 --> 01:28:13,884
It was tough. It was a tough
way to make a living.

1573
01:28:13,885 --> 01:28:16,006
You know what I mean? But
sometimes that's all you got.

1574
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:19,130
You know, boxing is a lot
like a chess game.

1575
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,967
You've gotta be two
or three moves ahead.

1576
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,972
'Cause any time
you throw a punch,

1577
01:28:22,973 --> 01:28:24,942
boom... here comes
the counterpunch.

1578
01:28:24,943 --> 01:28:26,979
You're gonna jab
with this punch, okay?

1579
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,153
All right. And then I'm going
to slip that jab, right?

1580
01:28:30,154 --> 01:28:32,060
Now what? Now what?
Now they...

1581
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:34,063
boom!
It's just bang bang!

1582
01:28:34,064 --> 01:28:36,168
And it's like...
it's a real quick punch.

1583
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:38,207
But a lot of people can't do it

1584
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:41,659

Gentlemen.

01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:55,777
I'm looking
for a good clean fight.

1588
01:28:55,778 --> 01:28:57,080
No hitting below the belt,
no hitting behind the head.

1589
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,318
In case of a knockdown, you're
gonna go to your neutral corner

1590
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:00,990
and wait
for further instructions.

1591

Any questions?

moving around

Okay? He's got nothing on you.

This guy's nothing.
He's got nobody.

has is that left hook.

That's it.
That's the only thing he's got.

- You've gotta counter that.
- That's how he does it.
