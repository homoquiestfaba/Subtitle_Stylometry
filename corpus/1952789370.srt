00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,123
[door creaks open]

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
(Ethan)
Dada?

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
(male voice)
Mm.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,360
Dada?

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,600
Mm.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,920
Mm.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,040
[sighing]

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,040
There are no bad
people coming, okay?

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,880
How do you know?

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,520
Well, 'cause there
are two cars in
the driveway.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,360
There are plenty of other
houses with no cars
in the driveway

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
that they're
going to instead.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,400
What if they
can't see the cars?

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,080
If they can't
see the cars

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,240
then they need to
have their eyes checked.

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,360
Good night.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Can you leave
the light on?

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Brighter?

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
Go to
sleep now.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Could I have a
glass of water?

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,120
[alarm beeping]

22
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
When's Mama
getting home?

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,160
Sometime after lunch.

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Mm. This
toast is burnt.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
Fire me.

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,480
Is Grandpa Ernie gonna
eat every meal with us?

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
Only if he's good.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
If he's bad, we force
him to eat in his own room.

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,560
Excuse me.
Your room.

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,000
Gimme. I'll scrap
off the burnt.

31
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,880
No, it's fine.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Will he smell bad?
Last time he was here
he smelled like pee.

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
Ew. can we not
talk about pee
during breakfast?

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
You can
block your nose.

35
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Like this, see?
Right now, I can't
smell a thing.

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,560
Are you done yet?

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,520
No.

38
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,040
Be done. Now.
Now. Come on, come on.

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Have you decided
about prom yet?

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,080
Because I have to
sign up for it by tomorrow.

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,640
can we talk about
that when Mama gets
home, please?

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,080
Will everybody at
the prom be gay?

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,920
Yeah. That's why they call it
the Gay and Lesbian Prom, moron.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are lesbians gay?

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Okay, that's it.
No more. No more. Enough.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,840
No more questions.
Out. You.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,920
And yes, they are.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
No one's gonna
do anything.

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,880
They have like a
million chaperons.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,400
I don't want you dancing 
with college kids, period.

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
What are they
gonna do, rape me?

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,120
can we not talk
about this right now?

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm not interested in being 
with someone who's older.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,360
I just wanna dance with 
other people who are gay.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,760
I think I'd rather talk 
about the smell of pee.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,280
Huh.

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,280
You know, it's very nice
of you to give up your room.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Very generous.

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Do I have a choice?

60
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,120
Come on. Hop, hop, hop, hop, 
hop, hop, hop, Peter Cottontall.

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,120
You know, I'm gay whether
I go to the prom or not.

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
We'll talk about it 
when Mama gets home.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Do you think Grandpa
Ernie will die soon?

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,600
I don't know.

65
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,080
Did you remember
your violin music?

66
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,960
Yes.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you think people
come back after they die?

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,400
Like as other
people or things?

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,240
No. I mean, I, I think you sort 
of just die when you die.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,440
You know, go back in the sky, 
all your atoms and stuff.

71
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,120
That's what I think.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,000
I hope I come
back as a flower.

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,480
They smell
really good.

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,960
Okay. I could see that.
I mean, I agree.

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,200
Flowers are good. It's a good life,
a flower's life, I think.

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,080
Not a very long
life, but a good life.

77
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,440
I'll see you later.

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
Don't forget
your violin.

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,720
(Ned)
Hey, it's me.

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Um, I hope you guys made it 
to the airport okay.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I guess I'll, I'll just 
meet you at baggage claim.

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,720
Um, I miss you.

83
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
God help us.

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
Oh, and we gotta deal
with that gay prom thing.

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,400
It's not going
away. Okay?

86
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
I love you.

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,600
What about anal? My straight friends 
tell me anal's the new oral.

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
So, Darren, Lindsay
in the shower.

89
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,760
Lindsay feels Darren 
coming up the Panama Canal.

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
I haven't seen that on TV.

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
(Brian)
Maybe Lindsay straps one on

92
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
and Darren's not into it.

93
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,280
No. Seen it before.

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,280
Maybe he is into it.

95
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,360
What if they try to screw 
but she gets terrible gas.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,240
Come on, people,we have 
five shocking moments

97
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,960
In every script.
We only have three.

98
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Ned, true or false.
Anal's the new oral.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,640
Uh, I'd settle for oral
being the new oral, but that's me.

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,920
My wife didn't like it.
It gave her the runs.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Okay. What if Lindsay develops 
a thing for her Dalmatian

102
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
and it turns into this
incredible obsession?

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,600
Yes! Thank you. Bestiality, 
the final frontier. I love it.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,040
Right?

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,080
You don't think that's a 
little bit unrelatable?

106
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,000
You're talklng like
a fucklng executive.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,320
There is nothing unrelatable
about sex with animals.

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,240
I know a lot of people
who've done it.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,080
Sex with one's dog is
the new sex with one's cat.

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,080
I don't give a fuck about 
unrelatablllty as long as it is shocking.

111
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,760
And what if they didn't have sex
for an episode?

112
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,920
Personally, I'd find that 
pretty shocking.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
[cell phone rings]

114
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Are we keeping
you from something?

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,680
Sorry. Um, I have to
pick up my wife at the airport.

116
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,160
Her father's coming in and--

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,600
When are we getting your script?

118
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
Well, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

119
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,080
The next couple of days 
are gonna be kinda tough

120
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,520
because of Jeannie and I--

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,440
No. Monday.

122
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay. Monday, I'll try.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,080
Don't try. Just do it.

124
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Act four.
Two shocking moments.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,160
[horns honking]

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,320
[siren wails]

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,600
[cell phone rings]

128
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,200
Shit.

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
(Ned)
Hey, you made it.

130
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,200
Where are you?

131
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Stuck. Traffic is unbelievable.
How's Ernle?

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,720
Uh, chipper.

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
How was getting him there?

134
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,400
It's been a little tough, but 
we're hanging in there, right, Ernie?

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,880
[hushed tone]
Don't get a ticket, but hurry.

136
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
[beep]

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,960
Dad?

138
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:15,720
At least they didn't lose our luggage.
That's a relief, right?

139
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
You need the bathroom
or anything?

140
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
It's just a side effect.
They told us it might happen, right?

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,920
You can change as soon as you
get home.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,920
- (Ned) Hey I
- It won't be too long now.
Here you go.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,360
Sorry I'm late.
The traffic.

144
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,040
Doesn't matter where you're going 
or what time you go

145
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,760
it's always bad.

146
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,080
How are ya?

147
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,720
Hey, Ernie.
You look good.

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
Welcome to the Big Apple.

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,520
(Ned) You must be pooped.

150
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
It's been quite a whirlwind,
huh, Dad?

151
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,960
I sold just about everything

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,480
except his favorite
chair and ottoman.

153
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,800
They'll be here
in a few weeks.

154
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,960
And his upstairs neighbor is gonna 
try to sell his electric wheelchair

155
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,080
which is too heavy
to ship out.

156
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,320
You won't see a dime.
She'll spend it on drugs.

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
She's 83. I think we can trust her.

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,600
She was always saying
hello in the elevator

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,400
asking me how was I doing...

160
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
if she could do anything for me.

161
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,120
Very manipulative.

162
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,640
[snoring]

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't even like him.

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,600
You're a good daughter.

165
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,280
I'm a guilty daughter.

166
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,760
I should have found a place 
for him there. He's toxic.

167
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,120
You couldn't keep jumping on 
a plane every time he fell down

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,320
or called you from some
emergency room with chest pains.

169
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
I haven't spent this much time 
with him in 30 years.

170
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,480
I already feel like I did then.

171
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,800
He's not happy unless he can make 
you as depressed as he is.

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
Well, look. He's here.

173
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
You're gonna have to find 
some way to deal with it

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
or you're just gonna be 
miserable all the time.

175
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,800
This is perfect.
I finally get three clients lined up

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,160
now I gotta cancel them.

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm sure they'll come back.

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,800
I tried to explain to him again
what I did.

179
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
He said he would like
to see the studies

180
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
showing the efficacy of touch 
for the treatment of pain.

181
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,520
[laughing]

182
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,880
Oh, shit.
I gotta go.

183
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Look at this.

184
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
What?

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,360
The doctor said to keep him away 
from alcohol, including mouthwash.

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,280
That's why he goes
through so much of it.

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,640
He's like a teenager.

188
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,760
At least he's
not a gay one.

189
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,400
- [cell phone ringing]
- We gotta talk to Jonah
about this gay prom thing.

190
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
I don't want him to go.

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,080
He can be mad at us,
I don't give a shit.

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,000
This is Ernie's doctor in Detroit.
I have to take this.

193
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,880
I don't want him to go.
He can logic us to death.

194
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,880
Hello?

195
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,360
He's not going.

196
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes, I did.
Thank you for getting back to me.

197
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Anyways, I don't want to be
the one who always says no.

198
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
No. The one you gave me was two years old. 
It's completely outdated.

199
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,040
- (Ned) I think it's pretty important that we present
- (Jeannie) Well, someone must have written

200
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,720
- (Jeannie) something down somewhere.
- (Ned) the united front here, don't you think?

201
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
- (Jeannie) He was in the hospital for two weeks.
- (Ned) So that I'm not always the bad guy?

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
No, no, no. It's another Bliss.
My father lived in Belleville. Yes.

203
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Yeah.

204
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,680
We've been through this.

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,240
Okay, I'm, I'm gonna leave now.
I'll call you when I'm on my way back.

206
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,520
Welcome back.

207
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,400
No, he's not dead.
He's in New York.

208
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,720
[horn honks]

209
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
Gotta go.

210
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,560
Hey.

211
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
[kissing noises]

212
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,080
I missed you.
Look at you.

213
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,040
It looks like you've grown 
two inches in a week.

214
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,800
Your hair is huge.

215
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,960
How's Ernie?

216
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
It's gonna take him a little 
while to get reoriented.

217
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,120
Pretty big change.

218
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Is he still sad that Shirlee died?

219
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,800
Very. But he's been pretty sad
for a long time.

220
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
How are you?
I've missed you.

221
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,720
I had a dream the other night
that your plane crashed

222
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
and you were killed.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
You know, there's a much better 
chance of dying in a car crash

224
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,840
than in a plane.

225
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Anyway, I'm back,
safe and sound.

226
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,760
(Ned)
What's he thinking, you know?

227
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,960
There's more, Dad.
You want it?

228
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,000
I, it gets me so pissed off,
because I waited

229
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,160
I waited a week for the notes 
on that outline

230
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,840
and then he's Ilke, hurry up, 
I need it yesterday.

231
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
(Ethan)
These taste weird.

232
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,880
Are these the ones from
Whole Foods?

233
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
(Jeannle)
Yes, they are.

234
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
And they're the kind
you like. Eat them.

235
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
My boss is very, uh...

236
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,000
- unpredictable.
- [Ernie snorts]

237
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,520
(Jonah)
So I'm supposed to bring a check

238
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,120
for the prom by tomorrow.

239
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,160
And if I'm late, it's
ten dollars extra.

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
Can we not talk 
about the prom right now?

241
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,080
Mama just got home.

242
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
We'll talk about it later.

243
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
You want some salad, Dad?

244
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,400
You need to have something.
You've barely eaten all day.

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,000
I need my shit-kit.

246
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,000
Ned, could you?
It's in the bathroom.

247
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,840
I can get it. I'm not dead
yet, goddamn it.

248
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
What's a shit-kit?

249
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,840
Here, let me with that, Ernle.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,360
It's a kit that cleans shit.

251
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,920
Would you mind?

252
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,040
This fucking thing, Jesus Ohrist!
Piece of crap!

253
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,320
No big deal, Ernie.

254
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:01,960
Careful of the glass.

255
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,320
Why she didn't bring the goddamn 
scooter is a mystery to me!

256
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,360
It was too heavy, I told you.

257
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Why the hell didn't you let me die 
there in the first place?

258
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,760
I didn't ask you
to fuckin' move me here!

259
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,240
[coughing]

260
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,520
Ned, could you take him 
in his room and help him change?

261
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,960
Sure, I'd love to.

262
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
Ready, Ernie?

263
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,040
Eat. Eat.

264
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
[keyboard clicking]

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,840
Hey.

266
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
Hey.

267
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,040
What are you doing?

268
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,760
Just chatting with some friends.

269
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,560
Anyone I know?

270
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,200
Not really.
Just kids from school.

271
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,760
Ah. You're not talking to people 
you don't know, are ya?

272
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,240
Uh, you mean potential pedophiles?

273
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Mm-hm.

274
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,280
Just the ones who live around here.

275
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,000
All right. It's after ten.
Why don't you shut it down now?

276
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,760
can I have five more minutes?

277
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,280
No. can you just shut it down 
without a big negotiation?

278
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,960
Do you think I like coming down here 
and being the Internet police guy?

279
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
No. I don't.

280
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,000
It's after ten.
Now, shut it down.

281
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,440
Okay. Fine. Just let me say goodbye.

282
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,360
I wouldn't want to
be rude to a priest.

283
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
[chuckles]

284
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
You...

285
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, the day my
mother married him

286
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,160
that morning her mother told her 
she was making a mistake.

287
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,920
That she was climbing--

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,760
Climbing into a sick bed.
I know, you told me.

289
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,640
At my brother's funeral

290
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,840
he was furious at my mother 
for crying too loud--

291
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,400
for making a scene. He told her
to shush at her son's funeral.

292
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
I know. I know.

293
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,280
He's just such an idiot.

294
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,760
[sigh]
Well, you know, he was, um

295
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,760
he was probably upset too. He just...

296
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,840
Don't. Don't.

297
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,800
What?

298
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,920
Don't come running to his defense 
every time I'm mad at him.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Which is pretty much all the time.

300
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,200
This is a huge
adjustment for me

301
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
having him so close.

302
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,440
It's nothing I ever anticipated, 
okay?

303
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,000
It's gonna take me some time.

304
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,320
Okay.

305
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,200
[scoffs]

306
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,920
[sighs]

307
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,800
How often do you
and your wife have sex?

308
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,360
Not as often as I'd like. Why?

309
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
How often do you fantasize 
about someone else

310
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,040
when you and your wife have sex?

311
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Not as often as I should. Why?

312
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,320
I've never been in 
a relationship for so long.

313
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,520
I don't know how you married 
guys do it, day in, day out.

314
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, that's, uh--

315
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,360
I feel like I'm turning to dust.

316
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,200
That's how it is sometimes.

317
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,720
This is your son?

318
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,840
Yes.

319
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,760
He's cute.

320
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,480
Does he have a girlfriend?

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,120
No. Not really.
Not, uh, not yet.

322
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
The B story.
It doesn't work.

323
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,440
I've already written it, Garrett.

324
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,600
Rewrite it.
It sucks.

325
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,920
He overdoses on painkillers.

326
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,800
That is boring.

327
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,960
I mean, I've seen that.
I've done that.

328
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,280
Surprlse me.
He gets high.

329
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,240
He runs over someone. Paralyzes them. 
Breaks their leg. I don't know.

330
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,240
Shock me.

331
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,280
[moans]

332
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,840
[piped in music]

333
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,240
(Ernie)
Where are we?

334
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,440
We're at the doctor's, Dad.

335
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,320
My gums hurt.
I gotta see a dentist.

336
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,560
Well, I'll call mine.
We'll see when there's an opening.

337
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,400
Look, they're bleeding.
I've gotta see one right away.

338
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll call when we get home.

339
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,720
And I gotta see a urologist, 
too, you know.

340
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,520
I got, I got a rash on
the head of my penis, I think.

341
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,360
My, my balls are unusually
tender and--

342
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Dr. Elias can look at them.

343
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,800
Is he a specialist?

344
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,320
He's a geriatric internist.

345
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Well, I wanna see
a specialist, okay?

346
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,080
And I gotta see a cardiologist
too with this arrhythmia.

347
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,000
They're gonna have
to up my digitalis.

348
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,640
One thing at a time, okay? 
I can't do everything.

349
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,080
I gotta--
I gotta pee.

350
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,200
Dad, I wish you wouldn't
do that. I can take you.

351
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,880
If I gotta wear these
fuckin' things--

352
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,600
I might as well use 'em.
[moans]

353
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,480
[sucks in deep]

354
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,880
[exhales]

355
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,520
You're here late.

356
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,240
I have to rewrite
the whole B story.

357
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,240
Apparently, overdosing on drugs

358
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,680
and falling out a
window is too soft.

359
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Isn't that sort of the whole point
of the episode?

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,080
The great downward spiral?

361
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,320
Yeah, it was.
Now it's incest.

362
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,360
[laughs]
Takes the edge off.

363
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
No, thanks.
I like my edge.

364
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,360
[laughs]

365
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,080
Why are you still here?

366
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,400
Oh, my ex is moving out.
Finally.

367
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,680
It's better if I'm not there.

368
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,440
[horn blarlng In dlstance]

369
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,560
How long have you 
guys been together?

370
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,520
Too long.
Almost a year.

371
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,400
Hmm. Is he a writer?

372
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,200
Actor.

373
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,880
Ooh.

374
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,440
[chuckles]
Never again.

375
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

376
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,280
They're so fucking needy.

377
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,760
How long have you and
your wife been together?

378
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,600
Uh, 19 years.

379
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,880
Wow!
Nineteen years?

380
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,760
Yeah, we met in college.

381
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,080
That is quite an accomplishment
in this business.

382
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.

383
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,120
Two kids?

384
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
Three. My father-in-law's
the youngest.

385
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,960
Oh, that sucks.

386
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes, it does, actually.
[laughs]

387
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,960
I mean, it's one thing if it's your parent, 
but taking care of someone else's.

388
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,080
You gotta be a saint.

389
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm sure your wife
is very appreciative.

390
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,920
You'll have a Get Out of Jail 
Free card for the next ten years.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,120
[chuckles]
Could come in handy.

392
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,080
Hang in there, Mother Teresa.

393
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,360
Later.

394
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,320
(Jeannie)And then they tell
us we have to see

395
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,480
three other doctors every
three months

396
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,000
at the VA just so they can
approve covering the cost

397
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,640
of all the meds he's taking.

398
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,240
These can't be
his regular doctors.

399
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,560
We have to see other doctors 
in between those doctors.

400
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,160
He's taking 17 prescription drugs.
Seventeen.

401
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,760
Anything good?
We could start a side business.

402
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,000
The Procrit alone costs $900 a month

403
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,240
and that's not even one 
of the ones they cover.

404
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Ouch. Okay. No more work day, 
okay?

405
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,840
No, no more, no more doctors.

406
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
No more meds.

407
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,440
No more, no more irritating
bowel disorders.

408
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Irritable bowel syndrome.

409
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,200
Okay. No more bowel
anything. Okay?

410
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,360
I told Jonah he could go 
to the prom.

411
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
[stammers]
I thought we were gonna present

412
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,120
a united front on this one.

413
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,520
He needs to be with other kids
like him, Ned.

414
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,320
Okay, but he doesn't need to be with 
guys who are ten years older than him.

415
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,720
He's just gonna get hit on.

416
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,960
There are plenty of chaperons.

417
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Who'll what? Follow him into a bathroom 
when he gets a blow job in a stall?

418
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
He's not going there for sex.

419
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,000
He's gonna be with his friends
from the G S A.

420
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,880
How do you know
what he's gonna do?

421
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,720
We don't even know what he's doing.

422
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
He's on that
computer all night.

423
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
I have no idea who he's talking to.

424
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,200
Do you know who
he's talking to?

425
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,760
If we're too controlling,
he's just gonna act out in other ways

426
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
that'll end up being even worse.

427
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,560
You mean if I'm too controlling.

428
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,920
(Ernle)
God damn It I

429
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
I'll go.

430
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,160
I'll go.
He's my fucking father.

431
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,600
can it be sooner?
His gums are bleeding.

432
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,120
That would be great.
Yes. Thank you so much.

433
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,680
Wai-wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. 
Could you hold the elevator, please?

434
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,600
(male volce)
Sure, ma'am.

435
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Great. Thank you so much.
They can see you next week.

436
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,560
Yeah, what about the urologist?

437
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,760
Every time I pee, it stings 
like a son of a bitch.

438
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,280
You should feel my balls. 
Oh.

439
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,000
[groan]

440
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
He's 13. What do I do with 
a fucking 13-year-old?

441
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,080
You play catch with him.

442
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,600
No, you play catch with him.

443
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,200
The only balls
I touch are Randy's.

444
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
And even those I'm
getting bored with.

445
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,880
It's not about
what you do, Garrett.

446
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,640
This is about
you two bonding.

447
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,360
And it's only for
a couple of weeks.

448
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, his son's so angry
since the divorce.

449
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,720
And then Randy phones him,
he gets angry, then he's crying

450
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,160
and then he hangs up.

451
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,840
It's torture.

452
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,600
Fantastic first script.
Applause for Brian.

453
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,160
Give it up,
let's hear it.

454
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,320
Those sorority girls,
they're nasty.

455
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,920
I love 'em.
This is good.

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,680
Very testosterone.
Very male.

457
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Little tweak.
Not too bad.

458
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,160
Fucking fantastic
first script.

459
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,520
Thank you
very much.

460
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
How's yours
coming along?

461
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,840
Oh, good. You know.

462
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,160
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking.

463
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,160
It's just, I'm in the thick 
of it still.

464
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,680
Can't tell yet.
But I think good.

465
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,000
[imitates Ned's voice]
That's reassuring.

466
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,920
[violin music]

467
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,880
You should work
on your legato.

468
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,800
It's an Italian word.

469
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
It means to bind, to tie together.
[clears throat]

470
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,880
From the Latin, ligare.

471
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm just learning it.

472
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,040
You're learning it wrong.

473
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,480
Your bowing's jerky.

474
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
Did you ever play the violin?

475
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,880
I know what good
musicianship is.

476
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,800
I was a percussionist
in high school and the Army.

477
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,480
I listen to Ellington and Basie. 
It's not just about the notes.

478
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,760
He's just beginning it, Dad. 
It's a very difficult piece.

479
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,760
If you learn it wrong, 
it's twice as difficult.

480
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,480
He's playing for enjoyment.

481
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,920
He's not planning
on being a professional.

482
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,440
Well, I guess then it doesn't matter 
how well he plays.

483
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,400
You were never able
to take criticism either.

484
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,200
I think it depends
on how it's given.

485
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,920
There's no easy way to give it. 
It's like medicine.

486
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,440
You just take it, 
if you really want to get better.

487
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,760
Night.

488
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,120
What am I gonna do with 
his son when he comes?

489
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,120
Randy says he's
a real boy-boy.

490
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,920
I have no idea what a boy-boy
talks about.

491
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,640
What do you talk
about with your son?

492
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,480
Uh, clean your room, shut down 
the computer, things like that.

493
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,800
[deep sigh]

494
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,080
How long have you and
Randy been together?

495
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Two and a half years. 
It's a record.

496
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,160
Except when I was 15 and I fell 
madly in love with a seminarian.

497
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,320
How old was he?

498
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,600
Twenty-five.

499
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,480
Must have been weird.

500
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,120
I mean, you know,
the whole age difference.

501
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
Some gays like 'em young.

502
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,160
Night, Garrett.

503
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,480
[violin playing]

504
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,800
(Jeannle)
He was supposed to call me back by six.

505
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,760
[smoke alarm beeping]

506
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,040
He increased the dosage
and so now he's getting dizzy.

507
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,160
He also is complaining
about constipation.

508
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
You know what? If you could 
just have him call me back

509
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,760
that would be great.

510
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,120
Ow, God! Damn him!

511
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,440
[beeping continues]

512
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Don't you have some homework to do?

513
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,200
[door opens and closes]

514
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
[beeping stops]

515
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
You okay?

516
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,640
Mama burnt dinner again.

517
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
We spent five hours at the VA 
waiting to see someone.

518
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Flnally I just left.
I had to pick up Ethan.

519
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,080
So now I'm taking him
back there tomorrow.

520
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,000
(Ned) It's okay. 
I didn't want lasagna anyway.

521
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,800
I can't do it all.
Chauffeur him to the doctor

522
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,240
pick up Ethan, go shopping,
make dinner

523
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,160
try to resuscitate
my nonexistent, fucking career.

524
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,920
It's fine. We can order out.

525
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,440
You can never have
too many burritos.

526
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,280
(Jonah)
I'm off

527
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,520
Hey, hey, whoa-whoa-
whoa-whoa. Come here.

528
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,040
What?

529
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
You're going to
the prom like that?

530
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,920
Yeah, it's a dance.
It's not like a formal thing.

531
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Don't they have 
a dress code or anything?

532
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,440
I think he looks fantastic.

533
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,840
Thanks.

534
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,200
You look great.
You look hot.

535
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,440
Knock 'em dead.
Have fun.

536
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
I want you to change.

537
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,560
Ned.

538
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
I think he should change
or he can't go.

539
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
This is what people wear
to a dance.

540
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
Why don't you just
go in a jockstrap?

541
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,840
You're being ridiculous.

542
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,800
[horn honks]

543
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
You can sorta see
the outline of your
penis in those.

544
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,680
Will you shut up?

545
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,080
You can't go dressed
like that. I'm sor--

546
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm gonna tell Ashley's
mother you're not coming.

547
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
Okay, fine, fine.
I'll change.

548
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,800
Thank you.

549
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,800
Asshole.

550
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,600
Hey! Hey! Say that again
and you're never going to a dance.

551
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,440
He can't go dressed
like a hustler.

552
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,440
What's a hustler?

553
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,280
That doesn't concern you.
Will you go to your room, please?

554
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,320
You're overreacting.

555
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,320
If that was your daughter, 
would you tell her, uh

556
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,040
that, uh, she looked
hot and to knock'em dead?

557
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,320
- I want him to enjoy himself.
- No, no, no.

558
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,040
But, but if it was your daughter

559
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,200
going out dressed like that, 
you'd be, like, bye, honey.

560
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Nice tits. Have fun at the dance.

561
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,160
He's not our daughter, 
he's our son.

562
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,040
Who's gay. It's the same thing 
except you can't get pregnant.

563
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,800
He's not stupid, Ned.

564
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,880
No, but he's horny.
That makes people stupid.

565
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,720
Is it some pedophile 
you're worried about

566
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,240
or the thought of him doing it 
with another boy?

567
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,800
Have you even told anybody 
that he's gay?

568
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
I'm off.
Is that better?

569
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,640
Yes. Thank you.

570
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,680
You look nice.
My sweater looks good on you.

571
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,040
Great. See ya.

572
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,520
I'll pick you up in front 
of the hotel at 11:30, okay?

573
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,200
[door closes loudly]

574
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,160
Did that sweater
look that gay on me?

575
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,640
[dancing music]

576
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,800
I have to get something to
drink. Okay.

577
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,960
(Ernie)
Who Is that?

578
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,520
It's Ethan.

579
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,720
Come here.

580
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,920
Hey.

581
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,640
Hey, do me a favor,
would ya, pal?

582
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,800
There's some, some
pills in the kitchen.

583
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,800
Go get 'em
for me, okay?

584
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,160
I don't know where they are. 
I'll ask my mom.

585
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,120
No, no, no, no. I don't wanna 
disturb your mother, okay?

586
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,800
Look, I, I, I bother
her too much as it is.

587
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,920
Besides, we don't want
her to get mad at us, huh?

588
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,360
They're in a cabinet
over the fridge.

589
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,360
Little, uh,
little white pills.

590
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,360
I'll, I'll give you a dollar, okay?
Come on.

591
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
Good boy.

592
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
Hey. There you go, champ.

593
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Open that thing up for me, will ya? 
My fingers are too stiff.

594
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,280
(Jeannle)
What are you doing?

595
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,400
You can't have any of those, Dad.
I told you.

596
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,360
If they kill me, good.
Good. Ah, who the hell cares anyway?

597
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,520
I care!
[grunt]

598
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,160
Go to bed, Ethan.

599
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,680
He told me not to bother you.

600
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,200
It's okay. It's not your fault.

601
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,720
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
It's okay.

602
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
You wanna kill yourself, Dad, 
you should have done it

603
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,280
before I moved you out here 
and saved me the trouble.

604
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,400
But you're not doing it
in my house

605
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,920
and you're not using my son 
as an accomplice.

606
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,520
So, you here by yourself?

607
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,400
Uh, no. No. I'm,
I'm with a friend from school.

608
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,600
Oh, cool.

609
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,400
Male or female?

610
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,840
Uh, female.

611
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,080
How 'bout you?

612
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,080
Oh, boyfriend.

613
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,240
Yeah, but we're breaking up.

614
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,920
Do you wanna dance?

615
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,240
Yeah. Sure.

616
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,480
Come on.

617
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,440
What do you think?

618
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,600
They said they'll probably have 
an opening by the end of the month.

619
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,680
He'll hate it, but he hates everything, 
so what difference does it make?

620
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,600
Four thousand a month?

621
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,200
Uh, more.

622
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Depends on what level
of care he needs.

623
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,320
The really nice ones
are between five and ten.

624
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,080
can he afford it?

625
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,920
No, we'd have to pitch in
about $3,000 a month.

626
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,400
Ah.

627
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,400
Unless you wanna keep him here.

628
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,200
But then you'll have to pay
for my institutionalization

629
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,560
which will probably end
up costing you even more.

630
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
I don't know what I was thinking.

631
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
It's like, 20 years of therapy,
you think I'd never had any.

632
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,280
[breathes deep]
Well--

633
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,560
it's a good thing
I love my job.

634
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,920
I better go pick up Jonah.

635
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
Before someone else does.

636
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,360
[club music]

637
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,400
[sighing]

638
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,560
[club music]

639
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,040
It's almost 12.

640
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,720
Yeah. Okay. Sorry. But five more minutes?
This song is about to end.

641
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,200
Now. You were supposed
to meet me outside.

642
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,600
Where's Ashley?

643
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Her mom picked her up early.

644
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,960
Okay. Let's go.
I'm double parked.

645
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,560
Oh, my God! That was so much fun.

646
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,520
I think I just lost
five pounds in sweat.

647
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,400
I just couldn't stop dancing.

648
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,000
What happened to Ashley?

649
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,480
Um, she got nauseous

650
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,800
so her mom had
to pick her up early.

651
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,080
How was the food?

652
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,360
I think that's what made her nauseous. 
I, myself, avoided the sushi.

653
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
Mm.

654
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,800
So, who'd you dance with?

655
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Um, mostly Ashley.

656
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,040
Um, and then when she left

657
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,400
I met this group of girls from Taft

658
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,200
and I became their best friend.

659
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,240
Who was the guy you
were with when I came in?

660
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Uh, Ian, I think
was his name.

661
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,120
But I'm not sure. The music was too loud.
[chuckles]

662
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,960
How old is he?

663
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,240
I feel like this is
the third degree or something.

664
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,040
No, no, no. I'm just,
you know, interested.

665
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,200
Well, uh, sorry.

666
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,520
He didn't show me his birth certificate,
so I, I'm, I'm not

667
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm not sure how old he was.

668
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,600
Definitely looked like
he was in college to me.

669
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,120
I personally think
you'd be better off

670
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,560
going out with someone who's a
little more your age.

671
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
We're not going out.
We danced. We met at a dance.

672
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
You mind if we not talk about this, 
because I had a good time.

673
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,160
And I'd rather not wreck it.

674
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,600
Okay.
[sniff]

675
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:03,480
[loud radio music]

676
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,680
(Garrett)
No, no, It's, It's like
a homeless shelter. Look.

677
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,160
He designs million-dollar houses.

678
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,720
He can't live in a fucking cave.

679
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,080
(Brian)
Wow.

680
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,480
Seems in a
pretty shitty mood.

681
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,000
I'm, uh, I'm guessing it's my script. 
I saw him reading it at lunch and--

682
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,680
He say anything to you?

683
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,560
[muffled]
No, he's just tired and grumpy.

684
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm sure it's got nothing 
to do with your script.

685
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Really seemed to love yours.

686
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,520
Well, I got a rape, a threesome, 
and a mutilated pet.

687
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,760
What's not to love?

688
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
That's true.

689
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Come on, he's
just being generous.

690
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,120
I'm sure he's gonna rewrite the whole thing.
[clears throat]

691
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Brian, there you are.

692
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,160
Uh, Garrett wants to distribute 
your script this afternoon

693
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,880
and a couple of your
names didn't clear.

694
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,920
I need you to give me
some alternatives.

695
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,920
Absolutely.
[chuckles]

696
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,200
Wow. Looks like he doesn't plan 
on touchlng a thlng.

697
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,880
[chuckles]
That's great.

698
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,160
[chuckles]
Ah, it's just beginner's luck.

699
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Gah, I tell you what, he is going 
to be raving about your script

700
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,040
in exactly the same way. Hmm?

701
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,840
Wow.

702
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,600
[piano music playing]

703
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
Ernie?

704
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,440
[loud music continues]

705
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,360
Ernie?

706
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,440
[band playing Sweet Georgla Brown]

707
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,680
[music continues]

708
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,640
[click]
[music stops]

709
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,280
You should get dressed.

710
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,360
We have to leave
for Ethan's concert.

711
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,080
Uh, look, I really need
to stay near a bathroom.

712
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
Why don't you
just go ahead, okay?

713
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I, I promlse I won't kill myself 
while you're gone, all right?

714
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,160
Uh-huh.

715
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,960
Scout's honor.

716
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,120
I'll lock up the knives.

717
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
We won't be late.

718
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,880
What were you dreaming about?

719
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Nothin'. I was listening
to Butch Miles.

720
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,520
He was Count Basie's best drummer, 
after Jo Jones.

721
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,360
Met him once. But I was
too nervous to even say hello.

722
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,600
Your mother did all the talking.

723
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,240
[music starts again]

724
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,480
So I bought him a cap gun, 
a water gun.

725
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,760
I bought him a baseball
glove made out of kangaroo leather.

726
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,400
I bought him a, a hoop, a hoop thing,
for basketball, hydra something.

727
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,200
Hydra-Rib. Yeah.
What'd that run you?

728
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,920
Like, uh, six,
seven hundred bucks.

729
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,760
As long as I don't
have to touch the thing

730
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,760
or watch a kung fu movie, 
I don't give a shit.

731
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,160
Randy's in charge of athletics.
I just sign the checks.

732
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,760
You change those names?

733
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah, it's done.

734
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,160
The script doesn't work.

735
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,880
It just, it doesn't work.

736
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,200
Okay.

737
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,240
It's boring.
The marriage is boring.
The drinking is boring.

738
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,640
His fight over 
those boring kids is boring.

739
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,440
I just want something else.
I want something unexpected.

740
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,080
Okay.

741
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,960
Let him screw a
hooker with AIDS.

742
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
Okay.

743
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,520
No, no, no. He's-- 
I've seen that before.

744
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,800
Just something new.

745
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
You've been married
a gazillion years.

746
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
You must be
bored senseless.

747
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
What do you wanna do?

748
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,800
Uh, I'll find something.

749
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, well, find it with Robin. 
She's gonna help you.

750
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
She's been on the show
since the beginning.

751
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
She was with me in L.A. 
She knows what I like.

752
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,160
Keep it fresh,
right, and sexual.

753
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,120
You know, there's not enough 
sex in this episode anyway.

754
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,720
And do it by Thursday
'cause the studio's on my back.

755
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,080
Look, It's a process.
And It's hard.

756
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,680
And no one's
getting fired.

757
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,280
Marni? What time am I editing?

758
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,720
[door closes]

759
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,200
Well. That went even worse 
than I imagined it would.

760
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,360
(Robin)
Ned, it's not that big a deal.

761
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
He over-dramatizes things.
You know that.

762
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,840
Yeah.

763
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,360
I read it, 
I thought it was good.

764
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,520
When were you gonna tell me?

765
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,960
- He asked me not to say anything.
- [scoffs]

766
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,080
Okay, look. We're gonna go through it. 
We'll come up with some new beats.

767
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,600
We'll throw in some sex with 
a 15-year-old. He will love it.

768
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,080
- Yeah. Try a five-year-old, 
then you're in the ballpark.
- It'll be fun.

769
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,320
- We can work at my place.
- We can work here.
- It's right over the bridge.

770
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,960
- I hate this place.
- It's fine.
- It's too sterile.

771
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,320
I do it all the time, all right? 
We're gonna order in.

772
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,560
It's not even gonna
feel like work.

773
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Wow. This is, uh, impressive.

774
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,280
[chuckles]
Writing for television does have its perks.

775
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,080
So I hear.

776
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,400
[cell phone rings]

777
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,400
Sorry.

778
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Don't worry.

779
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,240
[beep]
Hey.

780
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,600
(Jeannle)
Where are you?

781
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,920
His concert's about to start.

782
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
Oh, shit!

783
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,560
I completely forgot.

784
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,440
I have to work.

785
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,040
Garrett hated the script.

786
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,280
He didn't hate it.
Stop exaggerating.

787
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,280
Who is that?

788
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,560
Robin. He, uh, he wants her 
to rewrite it for me.

789
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,760
Wlth you, asshole.

790
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,440
We have to re-break it
and give it to him by Monday.

791
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

792
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,480
Okay.

793
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,800
Tell Ethan I'm really bummed,
all right?

794
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,440
I'm sure he'll understand.

795
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,800
Look, I have to go.
It's about to start.

796
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Tell him I want a private recital
tomorrow night.

797
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,600
Okay? Love you.

798
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,200
Love you too.

799
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,920
I say we swim before we work.

800
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,640
Helps wipe the slate clean.

801
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,400
My ex's. The only thing
of his I didn't burn.

802
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,240
Basement. Meet you there.

803
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,480
Uh--

804
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,480
[footsteps fading away]

805
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,400
[orchestra music playing]

806
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,920
[jazz music playing]

807
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,160
Okay. I am now officially 
coveting your life.

808
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,680
[chuckles]
Isn't it fab?

809
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,040
And no one's ever in it.
I got spoiled living in L.A.

810
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:03,880
There's just something so primal 
about swimming, so purifying.

811
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,080
You're really good at this,
aren't you?

812
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,080
At what?

813
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,160
You know how to live.

814
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,080
Well, I figure you better 
enjoy it while you got it.

815
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
The world could
end tomorrow, right?

816
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,080
What if he fucks his boss?

817
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:26,520
Uh, his wife's pregnant.

818
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,600
Don't you think
the audience would hate him?

819
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,520
I don't think so.

820
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,000
I think he's overwhelmed,
he's ambivalent.

821
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,280
I bet 80% percent of
the male audience has either done it

822
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,560
or wished they'd done it.

823
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,440
And maybe she's addicted 
to doing it in public.

824
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,960
Dressing rooms,
parks, at work.

825
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,040
The danger's just an incredible 
turn-on for both of them.

826
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:55,040
It's like she introduces him 
to his deepest, darkest desires.

827
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,960
Just a thought.

828
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,200
Could work.

829
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,960
We should probably start. 
Time's a wastin'.

830
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,440
Um, I'm, I'm, I'm just gonna, 
you know, swim a couple laps.

831
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
Purify myself.

832
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,960
Okay.

833
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,840
Shit.

834
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,520
(Ethan)
I stlll think I suck.

835
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,680
You didn't suck.
You were fantastic.

836
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,160
He knows he didn't suck.

837
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,560
He's just, he's being manipulative

838
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
as a way to get more praise.

839
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,240
First of all, you don't play the violin,
so you don't know.

840
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:48,960
Mm-hmm.

841
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,520
And second of all, you always say 
you didn't do good on a test

842
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,160
and then you get it back 
and it's an A.

843
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,920
That's entirely different because 
you can't know how you did on a test.

844
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,960
It's late, you guys.
Wash up and get ready for bed.

845
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,120
(Ethan)
You can't know how you did in a concert, either.

846
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,880
Dad, we're home.

847
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,360
And you don't know how
it's supposed to sound

848
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,680
'cause you're
not a musician.

849
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,040

I got it, Dad.

856
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,000
Have a little nightcap,
you know?

857
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,320
Jonah, can you help me?

858
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,480
Shirlee and I always liked
to have a little night cap.

859
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,880
Hey, where is old Shirlee, anyways?
Shirlee

860
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,480
Help me?

861
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,640
[groans]
All right.
I need a refill.

862
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,680
All right. We'll stand up first 
and then I'll have a re-- Oh.

863
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,000
Are you sure, I mean,
absolutely sure

864
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,400
we have 28 shocking moments
in every act?

865
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,520
Maybe we should count them.

866
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,400
I think he's gonna
be in little piggy heaven.

867
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,920
What pig wouldn't be in heaven?
Sex in public? Mm?

868
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
True.

869
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,760
You know, I should
get a partner.

870
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,040
This is so much more fun 
than writing alone.

871
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,720
Oh, it has its pros
and cons, believe me.

872
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,400
Well, you are
definitely a pro.

873
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,720
You're very good at this.

874
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,560
So are you.

875
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,080
You just need to listen
to that voice inside.

876
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,520
Trust it. Fuck what people say.

877
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,880
Hmm.

878
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,080
The only trouble is

879
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,360
all the other voices
all demanding equal time.

880
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,120
Gets difficult to hear your own.

881
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,200
Hmm.

882
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,280
I don't think that, uh, well, 
I don't think I, I can--

883
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,840
Sure you can.

884
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,760
I don't think I can.

885
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,640
Yeah. Just think of it
as a creative release. Okay?

886
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,000
I can't. I'm sorry.

887
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,640
I'm sorry. I, I, I
can't do this.

888
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,560
How's Ernie?

889
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,480
Sleeping, finally.

890
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,000
I thought putting it
out of reach would be safe.

891
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,360
I guess I underestimated
his resourcefulness.

892
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,440
How was Ethan's concert?

893
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,040
Long. But he did great.

894
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,560
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

895
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,400
I didn't have a choice. 
I had to work.

896
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,880
Does drinking help
the creative process?

897
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,920
We had some wine.
Is that a problem?

898
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,600
I have a job.

899
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,280
If I wanna keep it,
certain things are required of me.

900
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,040
Okay, fine. Be angry.
Why should tonight be any different?

901
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,560
I just wiped my father's ass 
and now I'm cleaning up the vomit

902
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,880
from his alcoholic bender.
Am I allowed to be angry?

903
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,440
You're always angry.

904
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,760
You have a shitty
father, all right?

905
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,120
He's critical. He's negative.
He doesn't love you.

906
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,480
How long are you going 
to hold onto them

907
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,280
until he's fuckin' dead?

908
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,400
So you're the only one 
who gets to be angry.

909
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,440
I can see that what's happening 
here is a huge downer for you.

910
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,760
You can add it to your list,
next to gay son

911
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,600
sucky job, and wife
who's over forty.

912
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,960
It's not quite the party 
you were hoping for?

913
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,720
Maybe there's a better one 
happening somewhere else.

914
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,600
I'm sorry 
I missed your thing.

915
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,360
Mama said you were fantastic.

916
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,840
I sucked.

917
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,120
(Jonah)
Oh, God. You didn't suck.

918
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,360
You sounded great.

919
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,600
Ernie got drunk
and had diarrhea.

920
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,280
I heard.

921
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:10,320
It got on the floor
and Mama stepped in it.

922
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Well, that explains
her chipper mood.

923
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,280
Then she started to cry.

924
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,040
Get some sleep.

925
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,280
Oongratulations.

926
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,320
[weeping]

927
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,880
[weeping]

928
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,080
Morning.

929
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:15,920
Morning.

930
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,520
Morning.

931
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,840
Hey, so listen.
I'm gonna go to Emily's tonight

932
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,400
and do some homework
and maybe watch a movie.

933
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,280
Is Emily's mother
gonna be there?

934
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,880
Why? I'm gay.

935
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,200
I'd still like an adult 
to be present.

936
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,200
Sarah says she's bi,
but she hasn't even told her mother yet.

937
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,880
That's because Sarah's only
12 years old.

938
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,400
How can you possibly
know what you are

939
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,800
when you're only 12 years old?

940
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,200
Jonah knew when he was 12.

941
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,480
Okay, you. Come on. Come on. 
I'm driving today and

942
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,040
I can't be late.
Let's go.

943
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,640
So can I tell Emily that
It's cool?

944
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,400
(Jeannle)
I can't take you.

945
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,760
I have to take Ernie
to an appolntment

946
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,720
that's gonna last a long time

947
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,400
and then I'm making dinner 
and I just can't take you.

948
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,160
It's, it's okay.
I can walk.

949
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,600
Thanks.

950
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,040
So you're meeting
me there, right?

951
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,320
I will if I can.

952
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,600
I can't do this alone, Ned.

953
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,800
Can you please tell Garrett 
it's an emergency?

954
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,800
I haven't even told Ernie yet.

955
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,120
Yeah, yeah. I'll,
I'll, I'll meet you there.

956
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,520
Tonight's okay.
So pick me up

957
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,320
at the corner of Lexington 
and Jackson at seven.

958
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,360
[beep]

959
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,080
[knocks]

960
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,280
I brought you
some tea and toast.

961
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:37,400
[moans]
My head is throbbing.

962
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,960
And some aspirin.

963
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,920
No, I'm too nauseous.

964
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,760
That was a lot of
gin you consumed.

965
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,720
It's better if you keep it 
in the freezer.

966
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,520
It's better if you
don't drink it.

967
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,680
That's what the
doctor said, right?

968
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,160
What the hell do
the doctors know?

969
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,520
They thought Tommy
had a parasite.

970
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,560
I found a place
I think you'll like.

971
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,200
There's a nurse
there on the premises.

972
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,440
They can bring you
whatever you like.

973
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,240
It's just not
working here, Dad.

974
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,840
I think you were right.

975
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,240
It was a mistake to
bring you out here.

976
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,200
You did the best you could.

977
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,400
I shouldn't have had children.

978
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,240
Shouldn't have been a father.

979
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,280
I didn't like mine, either.

980
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,000
Well, I don't give
a fuck what they think.

981
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,840
I am not changing a word. 
Not a period, not a semicolon.

982
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,280
This is the story
I'm telling. Okay.

983
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,320
[beep]

984
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,920
I do not know if 
I'm gonna make this season.

985
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,360
The fucking bloodsuckers
are sucking me dry.

986
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,240
Good first act.

987
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,600
Rewrite, excellent. The whole sex 
in public session, I like it.

988
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,200
Need the rest by tomorrow.

989
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,960
Uh, Garrett, is there any chance
I could--?

990
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,440
Tomorrow.

991
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,800
[snlff]
The pollen count.

992
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,160
It must be at an all-time high.
What is this?

993
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,280
Okay. Three more acts to go. 
Easy as pie.

994
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,560
I'm thinking
In Act Four--

995
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,560
Listen. Last night, I--

996
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,880
Just forget about it.

997
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,800
No. I shouldn't have--

998
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,160
I shouldn't have, either.

999
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,320
We were drinking.
We were loose. You're cute.

1000
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,440
It won't happen again.

1001
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,440
Let me just grab a coffee, 
I'll be back in a sec.

1002
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,920
I can't. Uh--

1003
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,080
Do you, do you think maybe 
we could do this later, like

1004
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,120
in a couple of hours?

1005
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,120
Yeah. No problem.
If I'm not here, I'll be at my place.

1006
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,840
Stop by whenever.
I will get us a little sushi.

1007
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,360
Brain food. We can
zip right through it.

1008
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,960
(Jeannie)
I think if we put up 
some of your art posters

1009
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,840
your chair and your ottoman
could go over here.

1010
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,360
Maybe we could get
a little bookshelf.

1011
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,120
(Ned)
That'd be nice.

1012
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,280
(Mitch)
We've got, uh, quite a few
residents from the Midwest.

1013
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,480
Your neighbor across
the hall is from Ohio

1014
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,280
I believe. He was a cardiologist.

1015
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,040
My brother was
a cardiologist.

1016
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,480
He thought it made him God.

1017
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,200
(Mitch)
I think he'll be very happy here.

1018
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:39,520
He won't be happy anywhere.
He's been depressed since the '50s.

1019
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:45,000
[soft piano music]

1020
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,560
The dining room looks nice.

1021
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,400
And they have, uh, that, 
that art appreciation guy

1022
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,000
who comes in once a week.
I mean, that's right up your alley.

1023
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,040
[cell phone rlngs]
Sorry.

1024
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,400
[ringing]

1025
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,400
Hey. No, I told him. Twice.

1026
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,080
It is an emergency.

1027
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,400
(old man number one)
I was a writer, too.

1028
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,320
Published 15 novels.

1029
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
Three of them optloned
by a major motion picture studio.

1030
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,520
Uh, look, I gotta go.

1031
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,640
It is-- I know. 
I know it's important.

1032
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,080
I was the head of Radiology

1033
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,880
at Mount Sinai Hospital
for 40 years.

1034
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Now I don't even
know my own name.

1035
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,360
Look, tell him I'll be there in an hour.
I'm leaving now.

1036
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,080
(Anita)
You movlng in, hon?
Or just visiting?

1037
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,000
We're all just
visiting, aren't we?

1038
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,800
Are you hungry?

1039
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,520
I found a deli that might 
even be better than Abe's.

1040
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,760
This is nice, isn't it?

1041
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:40,880
It reminds me of that house
we rented.

1042
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,320
I don't remember.

1043
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:48,080
Belleville Lake?
I was a senior.

1044
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,200
It was the summer
before Tommy died?

1045
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,640
I don't know how you
survive losing a child.

1046
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:08,760
Define survival.

1047
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:14,840
I saw my first psychiatrist,
I was 28 years old.

1048
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,280
Dr. Hochman.

1049
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,440
He told me
that happiness

1050
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,080
given my family history

1051
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,760
was an unrealistic expectation.

1052
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,480
You should have
found another doctor.

1053
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,880
[chuckles]
I did.

1054
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,640
Dr. Hochman proved
correct in his analysis.

1055
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,000

Okay, I'm gonna go.

1057
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,600
What time will you be back?

1058
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,440
Um, by eleven?

1059
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,840
All right. Call me
before you leave, okay?

1060
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,400
Maybe Dada will pick you up.

1061
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,000
Uh, it's no big deal.
I, I can walk.

1062
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,720
Okay.

1063
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,520
I'll have my cell on. 
All right, bye.

1064
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,280

1073
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,520
So you want anything to drink?

1074
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,840
Uh, I'm cool.

1075
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,160
I'll get you a beer, okay?

1076
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,160
I think we should probably 
go in the nonalcoholic section.

1077
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,920
Look, it doesn't matter.
These guys know me here. They're cool.

1078
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,040
I can't remember the
last time I got high.

Hmm. I do my best thinking stoned.

Think outside the box.

1082
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,040
Hate the box.

1083
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,360
It's never good.

1084
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,400
I mean, if I was writing a novel, 
I couldn't get past page one.

1085

But, I mean, we're not
exactly curing cancer, right?

1086
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,480
Now wait, no, no, no. Never 
underestimate the healing powers of, uh

Good. You know,
it's, uh, work.

think you'll be?

Um, I don't know. Why?

1095
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,680
Maybe you could pick Jonah

We went to Murray's for lunch.

We had a picnic on the beach.

It was kind of fun, actually.

That's a switch.
Now that you're kicking him out

It's like I've stepped
into someone else's life.

Did you try calling his friends? 
What about Jasmine?

1200
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:21,640
He hasn't been friends
with Jasmine in over a year.

1201
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,760
Okay. What about
the other one? Ashley.

Uh, we're pretty worried about you,
so call us back, okay?

Oh, come on. It's not a big deal. 
It was half a tab.

1210
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,280
Listen, I need to go because 
I told them I'd be home. Excuse me.

but it won't be for long.

1221

And what do you recommend?

1222
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,800
We could run more tests,
some of them invasive

1223
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,240
and see what our options are.

1224

Don't you think we should--?

1225
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,400
And the alternative to
that would be what?

1226
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,840
To let nature take its course.

1227
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,400
What does that mean
in terms of a prognosis?

1228
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,120
It's not an exact science.

1229
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,640
But my guess would be
two months at the most.

1230
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,120
Probably less.

01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,560
Look--

1370
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,280
Don't.

1371
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,240
We'll talk about it later.

1372
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,680
We'll work it out then, okay?

1373
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,680
You look good.

1374
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,720
I feel old.

1375
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,720
But you look good,
that's the main thing.

1378
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,080
[knocking]

1379
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,640
(Ethan)
I think Ernie needs you.

1380
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,680
(Garrett)
Fantastic rewrite.

1381
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,080
Midget sex?

1382
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,960
Christian Right's
gonna be all over this.

1383
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,360
What are you doing?

1384
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,440
Leaving.

1385
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,360
Just, uh, assumed
after my little, you know.

1386
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,600
Self-righteous hyperbolic rant?

1387
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,280
Yeah, that.

1388
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,920
Well, not unless
you ask me nicely.

1389
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,520
You were right.

1390
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,400
Now, don't get used to that.
I don't say that very often.

1391
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,560
But, you know,
sometimes I go over the top.

1392
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:33,560
The women sex torture thing.

1393
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,160
And even cable isn't ready
for cannibalism yet.

1394
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,160
But, I do think a good
flambé penis story

1395
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,080
you can put in on children's
television. Somewhere.

1396
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,720
Just, I'll get it in.
Next season. And you--

1397
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,520
Good to see you come out

1398
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,000
get out of the box
and just fight there.

1399
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,840
That was great.
Let loose.

1400
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,480
Do it more often.

1401
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,600
My son is gay.

1402
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,680
He came out six months
ago, but he's--

1403
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,480
he's known since he was twelve.

1404
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,600
I just--

1405
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,920
just thought you should know that.

1406
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,240
Look at you.

1407
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,480
You're not nearly as boring
as you pretend to be.

1408
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,360
(Ethan)
Can I hold him?

1409
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
He's heavy.

1410
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,240
Are all his bones in
here and everything?

1411
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,000
Pretty much. That's him.
[sniff]

1412
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,520
I don't think I
want to be cremated.

1413
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,560
I do.

1414
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:00,960
I don't wanna take years
to decompose underground.

1415
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,480
I don't really wanna
be burned, either.

1416
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,800
I'm not sure what
the alternative is.

1417
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,480
Maybe I can be stuffed
or something.

1418
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,040
That way I'd always be around.
