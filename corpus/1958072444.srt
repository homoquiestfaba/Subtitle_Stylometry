    he would show up himself.

        We are, um--

153
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,846
[sighs]
We're being lonely together.

154
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,915
    Why, you got
    somewhere better to be?

155
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:26,479
Yeah, I should be
looking for a job.

156
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,284
        You've got a job.

157
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:34,025
No, I'm-- I know.
I mean... a better job.

158
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,291
I'm really tired
of being broke.

159
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,658
            [clicks tongue]
        What?

160
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,101
                        What?

161
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:45,432
        Forget it.

162
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,467
    Your brother wouldn't
    like it, so...

163
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:50,008
Okay, well, he also
would not like me being here.

164
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:51,911
            Can't hurt him
            if he doesn't know.

165
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,981
    Oh, okay, right, yeah,
    but see, it, uh--
    it hurts you.

166
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,742
You might not be a good girl,
Riley,

167
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,777
    but you wanna be.

168
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,318
    You got a little Matt,
    just kind of
    sitting on your shoulder,

169
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:06,717
so he may be worth listening to.

170
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,026
        You know? Maybe?

171
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:10,391
            Hmm.

172
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:11,821
        [Trevor chuckles]

173
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,163
    Now you can tell me.

174
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:16,969
    There's nothing to tell.

175
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,138
                Tell me, Trevor.

176
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,106
                    Hey, stop.

177
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,438
            Hey, hey, come on.
            Hey.

178
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,176
        All right,
        all right, all right.

179
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:27,881
    Tell me.
                        [groans]

180
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,444
                Um, okay, um,

181
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:34,184
    so you know how
    I always make runs down
    to the warehouse district?

182
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:37,957
        Yeah.
    So, there's this one spot,

183
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:40,256
            that we used to
            drop stuff off at.

184
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,686
            Totally anonymous.

185
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,688
            Nobody's ever seen
            anyone in there.

186
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,230
    But, like, the shit
    they had coming in and out--

187
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:49,001
    it's like billionaire shit.

188
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,269
        So I pass it sometimes
        and I swear,
        it's abandoned.

189
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:58,670
            Totally abandoned,
            except for
            one last shipment.

190
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,212
So you wanna break in?

191
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,611
        Don't have to.
        I remember the key code.

192
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,019
                    [chuckles]

193
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,647
What's in the shipment?

194
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,781
                    Don't know.

195
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,024
Who does it belong to?

196
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,224
                I don't know.
                I mean, some--

197
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,062
            some rich asshole
            who's looking
            to make a profit.

198
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,360
    They're not gonna miss it.

199
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,759
                Give me a hand,
                I'll cut you in.

200
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,568
        You know what? I--
        Forget I said anything.

201
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,373
        Because, you know,
        you're trying to
        get your shit together.

202
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,771
    And I don't wanna get
    in the way of that, so...

203
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,213
    [sighs]

204
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:37,445
Shut up, Trevor.

205
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,646
        [thunder rumbling]

206
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,196
[exhales] All right.

207
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,068
Point of no return.
You sure you wanna do this?

208
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:58,433
Yeah?

209
00:15:08,577 --> 00:15:09,983
            [sniffs]

210
00:15:12,284 --> 00:15:13,448
                Mmm.

211
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,802
        [gate opening]

212
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:42,609
            Let's go.

213
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,850
        [Trevor hoots]

214
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:58,064
        [exhales]

215
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,563
                Whoa.
        Shh.

216
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,862
                [exhales]

217
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,371
        [Trevor chuckles]

218
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,278
                [sighs] Okay.

219
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:18,216
                Let's see here.

220
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,119
    Okay.

221
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:24,816
        What do you think?

222
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,655
What do you mean, what do I--
Do you know the combination?

223
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,328
        Well, no, um,

224
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:32,824
                        I don't.

225
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,962
                    [grunts]

226
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,374
        [panting]

227
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,347
No chance you could get it
if I couldn't.
There's a trick to everything.

228
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:52,415
            Right. Yeah.

229
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,255
Let's see it.

230
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,197
        [Trevor chuckles] Hey.

231
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,135
                Let's see here.

232
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,140
                Can you get it?
[grunting] Yeah.

233
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,208
            Can you get it open?
[grunts]

234
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,981
Goddamn.
Boxes within boxes.

235
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,128
                    Jesus!

236
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,658
    Okay.

237
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,264
                Is it open?

238
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,331
[latch clicks]

239
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,340
            [Trevor] Is that it?

240
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,771
            Fuck.

241
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:54,609
God, I thought there'd be, like,
a stack of bonds or some shit.

242
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,549
It's gotta be worth something.

243
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,288
        [Trevor]
        Let's hope so. Yeah.

244
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,590
        I'll take it
        if you don't want it.

245
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,758
    Yeah, yeah. Why don't you
    hold on to it for now?

246
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,300
I'll see if I can find
some kind of appraiser,

247
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:18,963
and we'll, uh--
we'll split whatever cash
we can get from it? Yeah?

248
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,899
                Okay.

249
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:28,247
[Colin]<i> "The waves were dead.</i>
<i>The tides were in their grave.</i>

250
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:31,679
    And the winds were withered
    in the stagnant air

251
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:34,451
    and the clouds perished.

252
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:37,157
    Darkness had no need
    of aid from them.

253
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,687
    She was the Universe."

254
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:42,822
                    Shit.

255
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,923
                    Mmm.

256
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,760
                Shelley.

257
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,465
                Percy Shelley.

258
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,797
                No! Mary.

259
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,799
    Byron. [chuckles]
                    Fuck!

260
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,273
            Fucking Lord Byron.

261
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:56,440
    [door opens, slams]

262
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:59,311
    [sighs] She's fine.
    Leave her alone.

263
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:02,446
        [Riley grunts]
        [clattering]

264
00:19:02,481 --> 00:19:05,581
Hey, do not fucking
leave this bed.

265
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,650
        [clattering continues]

266
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:09,849
                    Okay.

267
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,147
        [Colin sighs]

268
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,194
                [groans]

269
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,692
    [grunts]

270
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,926
[exhales] You scared me.

271
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,400
            Missed you tonight.
            Where'd you go?

272
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:24,468
        Out.

273
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,338
                Drinking?

274
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:29,066
        Mm-mmm.

275
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,201
            Bullshit.
            You can't even
            take off your shoes.

276
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:36,645
It's-- It's dark in here.
I was-- I was trying
not to wake you up.

277
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,747
    [smacks lips]

278
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:42,684
Don't ask me questions
if you know
I can't answer them, Matt.

279
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:44,620
                Pills?

280
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:47,084
        No.

281
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,329
No, seriously. Nothing.
            Okay, let me see.

282
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:52,463
Christ, Matt.
I'm fucking clean!

283
00:19:52,498 --> 00:19:55,730
    Hey, I worry about you, Ry.
    You gotta stick to this--
    Get out of my room!

284
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,336
        Riley, I'm not trying--

285
00:19:58,702 --> 00:19:59,833
                I love you.

286
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:01,835
You love having
something to fix

287
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,200
so that you can feel
like a big success

288
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,674
in this shitty apartment.
                Okay.

289
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:07,775
I see what you're trying to do.

290
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,239
You don't know a thing
about what I'm trying to do.
I'm not--

291
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,846
    You know what?
    That's okay.
    Neither do I.

292
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:15,013
            Okay. You're drunk.

293
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,719
    Yeah! Are you jealous?

294
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:19,622
Are you scared?
                Sleep it off.

295
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,394
            And in the morning,
            pack your shit.

296
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:28,895
    You don't mean that.

297
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,369
        The hell I don't.

298
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,274
    Then say it.

300
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,169
    Get the fuck out!

301
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,907
            Get the fuck out!

302
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,548
        Like that? You happy?

303
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,178
            I don't know what's
            gonna happen to you!
            Ever!

304
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,214
        You wanna play games?
        You will lose, Riley.

305
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,494
                Pack your shit.
                Get the fuck
                out of my house.

306
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,634
    I thought you'd never ask!

00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,912
                So long, Colin.

308
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,585

    It's just a bad night.

        All right, look up.

384
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,120

                Pills? Anything?

            No. Any word?

394
00:31:58,025 --> 00:31:59,849
                    No.

395
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:02,159
So, what now?
I mean what should we do?

396
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:03,622
    Should we...
    [Colin] I guess we wait.

    'Cause the cops
    can't do anything yet.

    They said a couple
    drops of blood
    on the sink isn't enough.

399
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,003
Apparently it m-might
not even be his.

400
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:12,136
        It's Matt's blood.

How do you know that, Riley?

402
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:15,799
        I told you,
        he cut himself on this.

What-- On that?
What-- What is that?
You didn't tell us about that.

        I don't know.
        I don't know.
        I didn't--

405
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,939
I was really fucked up, okay?

406
00:32:23,974 --> 00:32:26,909
And I was in and out of it,
and I wasn't expecting
for Matt to just be there,

407
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,548
and the pills were kicking in.

408
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:29,648
        I was seeing things.

409
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:31,584
                What things?
I don't know.

410
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,819
    I don't know.
    It was just
    crazy, fucked-up shit.

411
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,097
    You wanted me to tell you.
    I'm telling you...
    Yeah, tell me about Matt.

412
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:41,297

        his hand was bleeding.

414
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:45,565
He went into the bathroom
and then he never came out.

You never saw him come out.
                            No.

416
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,305
But you just said that
you were in and out of it,

417
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,208
fucking blitzed,
so what did you miss, huh?

418
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,507
Because he wouldn't just leave.
That's not him!

419
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:56,444
I know. I know. I know that.

420
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,842
So fucking think, Riley!
Please!

Hey.
What are you doing here?

431
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,539
        Kiss me.
    Hey.

432
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:02,576
What happened?

Ry, what?
                There was a--

438
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,420
    What the fuck is happening?
    What is happening?
    What, what?

439
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,323
            Riley? What is it?
            What is it?

440
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:47,588
    I don't know.

441
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,429
    [sighs] Okay, um,
    how many did you take?
                    Three.

442
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:55,332
Same stuff?
    Yeah, it's the same shit.

443
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,697
    It's never made me
    full-on hallucinate before.

444
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,735
I'm not on anything right now.
Why the fuck am I
seeing shit still?

445
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,376
I know, I know.
That's why we're laying
all this out, okay?

    [sniffs]

447
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,878
How did you get it to change
from the cube into that?

448
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,717
        I didn't.
        It changed on its own.

449
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,522
    [clears throat]
                    Look.

450
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,020
                It's a puzzle.

451
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,991
        See, the pieces move.

452
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,434
    If you get 'em to
    lock into place,
    then you solve part of it.

453
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:32,699
            But now, it's like--

454
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:34,932
                It's... [sighs]

455
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:38,034
        It's on the next step
        for something.

456
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:42,038
                Here, you try.
    Fuck no.

457
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,844
                You believe me.

458
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:49,012
Yeah, of course.
I told you I don't
fuck with shit like that.

459
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,883
        Yeah, but you--
        you really believe me.

460
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:54,017
        What is this thing?
        Where did it come from?

461
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,326
I have no idea.

462
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,657
        So what about
        the shipping container?

463
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:58,395
            Whose shipping
            container is that?

464
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,463
I don't know, okay?
They never
showed up to claim it.

465
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,366
    So--
        And the building?
        Who owns the building?

466
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:04,632
        Well, can we find out?

467
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,403
            There has to be
            a name somewhere.

468
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,180
Riley, this feels
a little crazy.

469
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,723
    There are no other
    Serena Menakers.
    I just wanna talk to her.

470
00:36:29,758 --> 00:36:31,857
            [knocking]
            [orderly]
            You have visitors.

471
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:36,829
[ventilator hissing]

472
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,345
        Serena?

473
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:52,713
Um--

474
00:36:56,884 --> 00:37:00,050
Hi. I know you don't know us.

475
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,328
My name's Riley McKendry
and this is my friend Trevor,

476
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,253
and we actually have
a few questions

477
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:07,497
    that we wanted to ask you,
    if that's okay.

478
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,030
Maybe it's a bad time.

479
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,967
            Bad time? My lungs
            are rotting out.

480
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:19,069
            I'm fucking dying
            in this place.

481
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,172
            What's this about?

482
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,679
        A warehouse.

483
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,681
            You'd have to
            be more specific.

484
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:28,452
Your name was on the deed.

485
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:30,685
You had something shipped in?

486
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:33,556
It's still there.

487
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,119
        It wasn't shipped in.
        It was locked up.

488
00:37:37,661 --> 00:37:39,122
            And it isn't mine.

489
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,223
    Well, can you tell us
    whose it is?

490
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:42,994
    How do you know about this?

491
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,063
            And why do you care?

492
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,408
            You have no idea
            whose business
            you've stepped in.

493
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:54,808
        Roland Voight was
        monstrous and sadistic.

494
00:37:54,843 --> 00:37:56,106
            Roland Voight?

495
00:37:58,418 --> 00:37:59,945
    Is that who you work for?

496
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,817
        I sorted out
        his mess of an estate.

497
00:38:03,852 --> 00:38:06,787
    And that was the last thing
    I ever did for him.

498
00:38:06,822 --> 00:38:08,822
            I'm not proud of
            the things I did.

499
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:12,826
            What you are after
            is dangerous.

500
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:16,797
    It ended Voight's life,
    and it will end yours too.

501
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,469
Or worse.
                Fuck this.

502
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,932
Fuck, Riley.

503
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,637
    Let's go. Come on.

504
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:24,508
            Riley?

505
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:28,644
Riley, let's go.

506
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,316
Is this what
you're talking about?

507
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,399
        Who opened this?

508
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,261
        This is not
        the first configuration.

509
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,537
                Who touched it?

510
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,572
        My brother.

511
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,202
    And now he's gone, isn't he?

512
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:04,812
            So you've seen them?

513
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,749
Roland used to see them, too.

514
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,247
    People thought he was crazy.

515
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,525
        Angels, he called them.

516
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,760
            You'd think a devil
            would know a devil.

517
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,094
                [coughing]

518
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:28,000
        Let's go.
                        No.

519
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:30,607
            [coughing]
            Give me some water.

520
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,369
        Trevor, go get it.
        Okay.

521
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,947
[coughing continues]

522
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:47,591
        I'm taking this back
        for your own good.

523
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:52,189
        Hey, why don't--
        why don't you
        put that down?

524
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,960
            I'm locking it up.

525
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:57,326
I'm sorry. I've got
nothing else for you.
                What?

526
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,933
        Come on, give it to me.
        Give it to me. Serena!

527
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:02,573
No, no.
    Serena, please give it back.

528
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,938
    Let go. You don't know
    what you're doing.
    Give it back!

529
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,402
[Serena screams]

530
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:08,480
Ow!

531
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,076
            [gasps]

532
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,817
[breathing heavily, wheezing]

533
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,662
    [Trevor] What happened?

534
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:29,633
            What happened?

535
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:32,262
It's okay.
I did it to myself.

536
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,901
        [panting]

537
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,548
            What the fuck
            happened in there?
        I don't know.

538
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:46,716
She-- The-- The thing
was on the table
and then she picked it up.

539
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,444
That proves coming here
was a bad idea, right?
    What are you talking about?

540
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:52,821
        She said that he's gone?
        How would she know that?
        How would she know that?

541
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:54,658
    Slow down. Slow down.
                How could she--

542
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,222
    Let's just unpack
    everything, all right?

543
00:40:58,257 --> 00:40:59,894
This is a lot to process here.

544
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,491
    We're not in a fucking
    meeting, Trevor.
    [sighs]

545
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,933
        [Trevor] I'm sorry for
        trying to fucking help.

546
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:07,638
                [engine starts]

547
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:12,302
    [puzzle box clicking]

548
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:18,110
            [wheezing]

549
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,935
    [orderly]
    Hey, she's feeling faint.
    She cut herself pretty bad.

550
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,497
            [nurse] The doctor
            just stepped out.

551
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:45,269
                        Okay.
        Let me check.
        Maybe she's still here.

552
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,501
    She's with a patient.

553
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:48,503
            [chattering]

554
00:41:52,784 --> 00:41:54,311
        [coughing]

555
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:59,690
        [rumbling, creaking]

556
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,156
                        Hello?

557
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,798
        [gasps]

558
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,615
        [entity wheezes]

559
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:30,622
            [Cenobite wheezes]

560
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:32,118
            [Serena panting]

561
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:38,861
        [clangs]
        [air hissing]

562
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,802
                [wheezing]

563
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,653
[Serena coughing]

564
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:12,587
            [panting]

565
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:14,589
        [chains rattling]

566
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:43,123
    [Cenobite snarling]

567
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:47,325
            [wheezing]

568
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:51,934
            [Cenobite chuckling]

569
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:00,470
            [crying]

570
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,184
        I'm sorry.

571
00:44:12,187 --> 00:44:14,385
        [sobbing] I'm sorry.

572
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:24,835
    I'm sorry
    for what I have done.

573
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:27,530
Have mercy.

574
00:44:41,051 --> 00:44:42,886
                        Save...

575
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:44,547
            your breath...

576
00:44:45,858 --> 00:44:47,726
            for screaming.

577
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:56,685
    Trevor.
    Hey, come here.
                Hey.

578
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,226
I just found so much weird shit
about this Voight guy.

579
00:45:59,261 --> 00:46:02,427
All sorts of fucked up
sex stuff. Accusations of
money laundering, too.

580
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:05,496
And then six years ago,
he just disappears.

581
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:07,498
Nobody knows what--

582
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:09,302
What? What's wrong?

583
00:46:09,337 --> 00:46:11,304
    Um, the lawyer's gone too.

584
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,571
What? What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
                        Menaker.

585
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,573
    I called because I was
    worried about her hand...
    Oh, God.

586
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:18,575
            ...and they said
            she wasn't there.

587
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,918
    She was in the infirmary,
    and then she wasn't,

588
00:46:20,953 --> 00:46:22,282
and no one saw her leave, so...

589
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:23,954
        Fuck.
                    Yeah, fuck!

590
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,583
    We need to get rid of that
    thing, Riley. All right?

591
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:33,293
            What are you doing?
First my brother,
and then Serena Menaker.

592
00:46:33,328 --> 00:46:35,757
Same exact shit,
six years ago.

593
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:39,233
Look. In the weeks leading up to
Voight's disappearance,
there were others too.

594
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:41,400
There was a groundskeeper,
there was a sex worker,

595
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:43,468
and there were probably ones
that nobody even knew about,

596
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:45,734
and they're all
loosely connected to him
and his estate.

597
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,209
And they're all fucking gone.
They're all gone.

598
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:50,915
It's happening again.
I know that this guy
has something to do with it

599
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,346
and I know that
that thing does too.

600
00:46:53,381 --> 00:46:55,414
It opens up and it--
it cuts you.

601
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:57,515
And then, when it does, you--

602
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,747
        [sighs]

603
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,782
We have to go there.

604
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,487
To his estate.
It's not that far.

605
00:47:06,328 --> 00:47:07,360
        [phone buzzing]

606
00:47:09,298 --> 00:47:11,397
[Riley sighs]
            You gonna get that?

607
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:14,466
    Yeah. [clears throat]

608
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:17,370
        Hey, Colin, what's up?

609
00:47:17,405 --> 00:47:19,438
            Hey, what's up?
            How, uh--
            Where are you?

610
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:21,506
    I'm hanging out
    at Trevor's for now.

611
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,805
<i>Okay, where is--</i>
<i>where is his place?</i>
<i>I'll come get you.</i>

612
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,950
        No, that's okay.
        I'm doing stuff.

613
00:47:25,985 --> 00:47:28,876
        We're all doing stuff,
        okay?

614
00:47:28,911 --> 00:47:30,955
    Like, but we should be
    doing this shit together,

615
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,188
    'cause I don't know
    what the hell to do here.

616
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:35,883
    <i> That's the fucked-up</i>
    <i> part of all this shit--</i>
    <i> like, Matt would.</i>

617
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:37,357
        Yeah, he would.

618
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,031
    <i> Okay, so I'll come get you.</i>

619
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:42,967
                <i> Riley?</i>

620
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:48,038
                    [sighs]

621
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,833
    Trevor! Trevor! Trevor,
    what the fuck are you--

622
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,637
                Trevor!
I'm tossing this thing,
all right?

623
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:55,342
No one's gonna know
the difference.
            The difference is,

624
00:47:55,377 --> 00:47:56,981
        I need it to find Matt.
        Don't you get that?

625
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:59,313
    Can we at least talk
    about it, please?

626
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:02,283
Talk about it?
You don't wanna talk about it.
That's why you fucking took it!

627
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:06,683
    I thought you believed me!
Well, I do. I do!

628
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,223
I do believe you, Riley!

629
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,423
All right?
            And I thought that
            I could trust you!

630
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:00,572
[gate opens]

631
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:52,525
            [sighs]

632
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:08,343
    [doorknob rattles]

633
00:51:34,398 --> 00:51:35,595
            Whoa.

634
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,838
                [doors creak]

635
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:22,136
        [gasps]

636
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:29,649
            Hello?

637
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:50,868
    [metallic rattling]

638
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:02,682
    [electricity humming]

639
00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:38,289
        [sighs]

640
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,786
        "Cenobite."

641
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:31,699
    [Matt whispers]<i> Riley.</i>

642
00:55:33,098 --> 00:55:35,065
    [Riley breathing heavily]

643
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:40,268
                Matt?

644
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:53,853
        [Matt] Riley?

645
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:56,559
            Matt?

646
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,858
        [Matt] Help me.

647
00:55:58,893 --> 00:56:00,563
            Where are you?

648
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,697
            [Matt] Riley!
            Matt!

649
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,262
            [gasps]

650
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:11,365
        [gasps]

651
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,411
        Matt?

652
00:56:19,914 --> 00:56:21,243
Is it really you?

653
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:24,312
        Do you want it to be?

654
00:56:30,122 --> 00:56:34,058
    Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
    I'm so sorry.

655
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:38,293
    I'm so sorry.
    I'm so sorry.

656
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,937
                [Matt whispers]
                Bring me back.

657
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:48,237
    [screams]

658
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,173
            Riley, Riley, Riley,
            it's me.

659
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,614
            It's Colin. It's me.

660
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,118
        I-- I don't understand.

661
00:57:01,153 --> 00:57:02,625
It's okay, sweetie.
We're here.

662
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,759
            What-- What the fuck
            is going on?

663
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:06,794
[Colin] We talked to Trevor
and came to find you.

664
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:09,225
                How?
[Trevor] The door was open,
and we heard you screaming.

665
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,732
Figured you needed some help.

666
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:13,460
        Help? I don't need help.
        Help with what?

667
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:17,134
        We're just here
        to bring you home.
        No, I'm not going home.

668
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,510
        I'm here for a reason.
        I'm not going home.

669
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:25,406
    Could you give us a second?

670
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:27,111
Seriously? Riley--

671
00:57:27,146 --> 00:57:28,409
        [Nora] Leave it.
        [Trevor] What?

672
00:57:28,444 --> 00:57:29,949
[Colin] Just trust me
on this, dude.

673
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:33,623
    We'll be upstairs.
    So glad you're okay.

674
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,317
        Riley?
        [Nora] Come on.
        Come upstairs.

675
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:37,352
[Trevor] What are we doing?
[Nora] Just give her a second.

676
00:57:42,766 --> 00:57:43,633
            [sighs]

677
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:50,035
    [Trevor] Does someone
    even live in this place?

678
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,641
    I mean, what is this?

679
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,940
        Right? What are we
        even doing here, okay?

680
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,645
        Let's just grab Riley,

681
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,680
    and just get the hell out,
    all right? Shit.
    [clattering]

682
00:57:57,715 --> 00:58:00,111
            Hey, chill.
                        Fuck.

683
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:03,114
It isn't the first time
we've had to track her down.
Just give her some space.

684
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:05,479
                Space. Yeah.

685
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:10,528
            All right.
            Might as well see
            what they got left.

686
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:17,865
    Um, shady.

687
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:21,099
Bingo. [exhales]

688
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:27,842
All right,
what's your pleasure, ma'am?

689
00:58:27,877 --> 00:58:30,680
            We don't drink
            when Riley's around.

690
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:33,012
        Right, right.

691
00:58:33,047 --> 00:58:34,310
                [sighs]

692
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,620
Um, okay. I'm gonna--

693
00:58:36,655 --> 00:58:38,556
    I'm gonna find a bathroom
    real quick.

694
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,185
                Sure.

695
00:58:42,122 --> 00:58:43,517
    [exhales]

696
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:50,524
                    Um,

697
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:53,527
            what is this place?

698
00:58:54,772 --> 00:58:56,068
        I don't know.

699
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:59,236
        A fuck dungeon?

700
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:03,372
    What, do-- do you wanna
    tell me what this is about?

701
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,430
    [classical music playing]
    Fuck! Shh! Sorry!

702
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:31,037
    [Nora] Sorry. Sorry.

703
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:35,173
        [sighs]

704
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:37,241
            Gosh.

705
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,654
[switch clicks]

706
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:46,624
[switch clicks]

707
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:49,220
        [switch clicks]

708
00:59:52,764 --> 00:59:55,226
[Riley] So according to Voight,
the puzzle box,

709
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:57,459
            it has six sides,
            six configurations,

710
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:59,736
        there are three left,
        and then it says,

711
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:02,530
        "whoever possess
        the final configuration

712
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:05,467
is granted a passage
to another realm."

713
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:07,535
To an audience with God.

714
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:11,572
Riley, since when
do you believe in God?

715
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:17,017
    What I'm trying to get to
    is that this god,
    whatever it is,

716
01:00:17,052 --> 01:00:20,922
offers choices to whoever holds
the final configuration.

717
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:24,651
        Get there,
        then you choose
        your ultimate desire.

718
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:26,928
Life, knowledge, love,

719
01:00:26,963 --> 01:00:30,162
sensation, power, resurrection.

720
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:32,560
        You see where I'm going?

721
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,905
No, I don't, actually, um--

722
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,972
                        Matt.

723
01:00:40,108 --> 01:00:41,712
            What if this
            brings him back?

724
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,112
Okay, Riley, um,

725
01:00:46,147 --> 01:00:49,181
let's just close this up
and get out of here.
                        No, no.

726
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:54,384
    [conversation continues,
    faint]

727
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,900
            Colin?

728
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:13,502
    [door creaks, slams]
    Shit! Fuck.

729
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:18,441
            Trevor?

730
01:01:20,709 --> 01:01:21,576
            Trevor?

731
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:27,890
            [banging on door]

732
01:01:33,293 --> 01:01:36,657
    Nora?
    Jesus Christ, you scared me.
    Why did you shut the door?

733
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:38,725
[Trevor] I didn't.
You called my name,
I came back.

734
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,002
How the hell did you--
        Get me out of here.

735
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:44,038
    There's a-- There's a panel
    behind the bar.
    One of the switches.

736
01:01:44,073 --> 01:01:46,370
Okay, okay.
Uh, hold tight, all right?

737
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:55,379
Okay, yes, Riley, this is a lot.
I know, but I was in
the playground when it happened.

738
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:58,822
It's a lot and I get it.
I get it, okay?
I saw the thing cut his hand.

739
01:01:58,857 --> 01:02:02,518
I'm not questioning you.
I'm just questioning this.

740
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:06,357
            The box, you have to
            get it to change.

741
01:02:08,163 --> 01:02:10,295
You have to mark a sacrifice.

742
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:12,770
And then they come to collect.

743
01:02:15,841 --> 01:02:17,434
            That's how
            you get your prize.

744
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:19,733
Here, look.

745
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:23,572
Wait, where's the--
where's the box?

746
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:26,410
                I don't have it.

747
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,613
    Have you found it?
    Yeah, w-- which switch?

748
01:02:31,648 --> 01:02:33,747
            Try all of them.

749
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,254
All right, all right,
all right.

            No! No, no! No.

01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:41,551
    [Riley] Oh, my God!

761
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:44,818
        Nora, hey.
        Hey, are you okay?

762
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:47,029
Are you okay? What happened?

765

        Okay, I'm-- I'm
        gonna pull it off.

I'm gonna try to apply pressure.
Oh, shit.

What happened? What happened?
I don't-- I don't know.
We were just in the other room.

771
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:10,646
    Fine. Help me
    get her up then.
    [Riley] Oh, my God.

01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:13,484
[whispering]
There was a man in the walls.

What did she say?
I don't know. She's out of it.
I don't know.

I'll load you up in the back.

No, the main road's left.

I'm going. I'm going.

            The road's blocked.

809

    No, we're not.
                        Go back!

            [sighs]

861
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:10,098
You were right.
We should have thrown it away.
I shouldn't--

862
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,408
You shouldn't be here right now.
You guys shouldn't be here.

863
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:14,641
        We came on our own.

864
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:16,973
No, you came because of me,
because this is my fault.

865
01:11:17,008 --> 01:11:19,239
We don't have time for this,
okay?

866
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:21,582
I'm sorry, but we don't, okay?

867
01:11:21,617 --> 01:11:24,816
We need to call the cops,
we need to let them search.
Okay?

868
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:26,785
Maybe they'll find her.
Who knows?

869
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,655
    They're not gonna find her.
    You know that!
Then they won't.

870
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:32,461
But I have no interest
in hanging around here
any longer, okay?

871
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:34,397
We have to get back
to the house.

872
01:11:34,432 --> 01:11:36,289
        Fuck that house. What?

873
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:38,731
Listen, that's where
Riley's car is, okay?

874
01:11:38,766 --> 01:11:41,162
    There is nothing good
    in that house, Trevor.

875
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:44,297
Okay, I understand that,
but we have to make
some decisions here.

876
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:47,509
Once we get there,
then we can talk about
what we wanna do next

877
01:11:47,544 --> 01:11:48,939
or whose fault it is.

878
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,908
    [Colin] Do not fucking
    talk down to me, dude.

879
01:11:50,943 --> 01:11:53,416
I'm not talking--
I'm trying to...
Do not talk down to me.

Not yet.

01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:21,576
Accept the pain

884
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:24,337
you have wrought.

01:12:26,748 --> 01:12:29,309
Greater delights await.

886
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:32,180
    We wish to see you proceed.

887
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:35,953
    I-- I didn't ask for this.

888
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:37,218
        But you did.

890
01:12:43,094 --> 01:12:45,468

01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,138
        Our gifts are boundless.

894
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:57,843
    I don't want them.

895
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,515
                    Yes, you do.

896
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:05,213
                Our god awaits.

897
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:07,556
            You know
            what it can offer.

898
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,823
        Resurrection.

899
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:15,531
Your brother's ending
was exquisite.

900
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,027
                    What?

901
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:20,536
Would it bring you comfort
to see him again?

902
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:25,233
    [Trevor, Colin in distance]
    Riley! Riley!
    Where are you?

903
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:28,544
Two more and he is yours.

904
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:30,337
        Feed it.

905
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,207
        Their pain.

906
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,780
        Their blood.

907
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:39,247
Unlock the next configuration
and then the last.

908
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:44,923
        No. I've done enough.

909
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:48,564

910
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,325

            Maybe, um, I could
            find something
            for your hand, too.

that runs along
the whole house.

1019
01:21:13,109 --> 01:21:16,770
It keeps them out.
            It keeps them out
            for how long?

1020
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,739
        Trevor's not gonna last.

                    What are we
                    gonna do?

1022
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:23,744
    You're gonna go.

1023
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,747
You have to take Trevor and go.
            Go where?
            What do you-- What?

1024
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:29,090
They have my blood.
You realize that, right?

1025
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,751
It's me that
they're after.
                    Stop.

1026
01:21:30,786 --> 01:21:32,489
Unless I give them one of you
and I'm not going to.

1027
01:21:32,524 --> 01:21:35,228
I'm not losing
anyone else.
                Neither am I.

    feel like taking my chances
    with those things.

01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,870
        So what else you got?

It's not exactly what was
supposed to happen, but listen.

was feed the box

and bring it back.

1046
01:22:55,002 --> 01:22:57,046
    I did. I did, Mr. Voight.

1047
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,181
        I did. Okay? I--

1048
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,680
            She was a mark.
            She was a mark.

1049
01:23:04,715 --> 01:23:07,551
            I brought her along,
            and she ran with it.

1050
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:10,851
        I mean, it was supposed
        to take her, okay?
    Coward.

1051
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:14,195
You should have
opened it yourself.
You should have made sure.

Okay, okay. It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter. All right?

1053
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:19,332
        She got a little

        [breathing heavily]

1055
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,665
            So what?

1056
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:26,570
        She found it on her own
        and she brought it here.

1057
01:23:27,342 --> 01:23:28,341
                        Right?

1058
01:23:29,575 --> 01:23:31,971
    Things took a turn.
    All right? I admit that.

Yes, I know. Just one, though.

We let one in. We lure it in.
We shut the thing behind it.

    in my hands and you knew.

    <i> But the Cenobites,</i>

1187
01:33:19,296 --> 01:33:23,265
    <i> their tastes were not</i>
    <i> what I imagined.</i>

1188
01:33:24,136 --> 01:33:27,137
    <i> They preyed on my nerves,</i>

    I don't know what
    they promised you.

1194
01:33:46,422 --> 01:33:48,895
Knowledge? Love?

1195
01:33:50,459 --> 01:33:52,426
    I sought pleasure.

1196
01:33:53,803 --> 01:33:55,803
But all they have to give...

1197
01:33:56,773 --> 01:33:57,805
            is pain.

1198
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:00,841
It's a trick.

1199
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,239
All of it.

        [clicks, snaps]

1201
01:34:36,043 --> 01:34:37,372
[Voight] Open it.

1202
01:34:38,078 --> 01:34:39,704
                Don't.

1203
01:34:39,739 --> 01:34:41,816
        Trevor,
        what are you doing, man?

1204
01:34:42,445 --> 01:34:43,884
    [Voight] Letting them in.

            What?

1209
01:35:02,806 --> 01:35:05,301
            Colin, go.
        I can't.

1210
01:35:05,336 --> 01:35:07,974
        Get up! You have to go!
[Colin] The room is spinning.

01:35:08,009 --> 01:35:10,570
        Colin, get up! I can't
        help you from here!

                Listen to me!
            Okay.

1214
01:35:14,411 --> 01:35:15,784
            They're gonna come!

1215

        You have to go!
        The gate's open! Hurry!

    Colin, Colin, Colin.

It's over, man.
It's over.

                    [Voight]
                    Go. Get up!

1221

        Yes. Take it.

1224
01:35:58,488 --> 01:36:00,257
    I give you their blood,

1232
01:36:58,053 --> 01:37:00,449
        Go back to the room,
        'cause they're coming.

        its priest.

1242
01:39:15,586 --> 01:39:17,586
    What did you think I built,
    a fortress?

1243
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,292
                I built a cage!

1244
01:39:21,757 --> 01:39:24,791
            And I'm not letting
            any of you go

1245
01:39:24,826 --> 01:39:27,266
            until it makes me
            right again.

1246
01:39:28,632 --> 01:39:31,336
    You reject our gift.

1247
01:39:31,371 --> 01:39:34,999
            Fuck your gift.
            Fuck you!

1248
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:37,309
        Now take it out of me!

1249
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:42,941
    Remarkable, all this.

1250
01:39:44,384 --> 01:39:46,516
        All for us.

1251
01:39:46,551 --> 01:39:51,785
        No, not for you. For me.
        I get what I want.

1252
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:56,988

to address your displeasure.

Isn't it obvious?

1255

        Wait! [grunts]

            Stop!

1269
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:44,095
        Just take it out of me.
        I don't want it anymore.

01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:49,540
        Just-- Just let me die.
        I'm begging you. Just...

1271
01:41:51,137 --> 01:41:52,180
                Just...

1272
01:41:53,282 --> 01:41:56,283
                Just let me die.
There is no retreat.

1273
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:59,220
    Once a threshold
    has been crossed,

1274
01:41:59,255 --> 01:42:03,653
all you can do is search
for greater thresholds.

1275
01:42:03,688 --> 01:42:05,457
                [Colin grunting]

1276
01:42:07,362 --> 01:42:09,593
Not him. I never chose him.

1277
01:42:09,628 --> 01:42:12,332
        And yet he is chosen.

1278
01:42:13,302 --> 01:42:14,631
                        Marked.

1279
01:42:15,502 --> 01:42:19,702
Gifts can not be ungiven.

1280
01:42:19,737 --> 01:42:23,244
Only exchanges
can be made.

1281
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:27,314
I was told that
the box is in my hands.
If not me, another.

1282
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:29,778
Right?

1283
01:42:29,813 --> 01:42:32,649
Not him.
            Riley,
            what are you doing?

1284
01:42:39,053 --> 01:42:42,890
Perhaps you prefer...

1285
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:46,267
            Another.

1286
01:42:55,872 --> 01:43:00,072
        Anything
        is better than this.

1287
01:43:00,976 --> 01:43:03,548
Perhaps we were wrong

1288
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:05,011
about you.

1289
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:10,885
You've never sought sensation.

1290
01:43:13,593 --> 01:43:15,329
    Your whole life,

1291
01:43:15,364 --> 01:43:17,298
every conquest,

1292
01:43:18,433 --> 01:43:23,062
all your pleasures
lie in... power.

1293
01:43:27,002 --> 01:43:28,067
            Power.

1294
01:43:34,977 --> 01:43:36,878
For your efforts,

1295
01:43:36,913 --> 01:43:40,750
we offer
the Leviathan Configuration.

1296
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:44,556
        Riley, Riley, hold on.
        Hold on, hold on.

1297
01:43:46,659 --> 01:43:48,021
            I tried to stop you.

1298
01:43:48,056 --> 01:43:49,297
                    Remember?

1299
01:43:50,729 --> 01:43:51,761
                        Yeah?

1300
01:43:53,732 --> 01:43:55,468
        Just put
        the fucking thing down.

1301
01:43:56,702 --> 01:43:59,274
            Just put the fucking
            thing down, okay?
        Mmm.

1302
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:05,071
                Give it to me.

            [gasps]

1314
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:19,079
Our power lies in dominance,

1315
01:45:19,114 --> 01:45:22,049
in the sovereignty of anguish.

it will be yours to wield.

[The Priest]
You will know our finest gift.

1327
01:46:38,798 --> 01:46:42,701
    No.
                Oh, yes.

1328
01:46:42,736 --> 01:46:45,935
            We have such sights
            to show you.

[both crying]

1331
01:47:37,857 --> 01:47:40,495
        Go.
                No.

1332
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,795
I'll be fine, okay?

1333
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,458
    Just finish it.

01:47:59,879 --> 01:48:02,880
Lauderant. Liminal.

1337
01:48:03,784 --> 01:48:05,047
    Lazarus.

1338
01:48:05,511 --> 01:48:07,016
    Leviathan.

1339
01:48:08,382 --> 01:48:11,251
    What would you ask
    of us?

1340
01:48:24,497 --> 01:48:26,101
        [Matt] Riley.

1341
01:48:29,073 --> 01:48:31,106
    Riley, look at me.

1342
01:48:33,539 --> 01:48:35,044
        Take my hand.

1343
01:48:37,246 --> 01:48:38,619
        Take me home.

1344
01:49:00,203 --> 01:49:01,499
                No.

1345
01:49:04,812 --> 01:49:08,308
    I've seen your rewards.
    I know my brother's gone.

1346
01:49:09,652 --> 01:49:11,476
        I don't want anything
        from you.

1347
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:14,083
                        Nothing.

1348
01:49:15,614 --> 01:49:18,285
    Then you have chosen...

1349
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,057
        A life of regret.

1350
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:24,962
Knowing everything
you've done,

1351
01:49:24,997 --> 01:49:29,197
everyone you've
hurt and lost.

1352
01:49:29,232 --> 01:49:33,234
        Your suffering
        has barely begun.

1353
01:49:37,273 --> 01:49:39,405
    You choose to live.

1354
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,441
To carry that weight.

1355
01:49:43,576 --> 01:49:46,379
Bitter and brief.

1356
01:49:51,122 --> 01:49:54,321
    You have chosen
    the Lament Configuration.

1357
01:50:46,276 --> 01:50:47,781
        [car door shuts]

1358
01:50:58,717 --> 01:51:00,893
    What just happened in there?

1359
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:04,798
        I made a choice.

1360
01:51:07,869 --> 01:51:10,331
It was the right one.

1361
01:51:10,366 --> 01:51:11,662
Right?

1362
01:51:38,064 --> 01:51:41,230
    [The Priest]
    <i> Roland, it's time.</i>

1363
01:51:41,265 --> 01:51:42,528
            [gasps]

1364
01:51:58,381 --> 01:52:01,217
            [gasping]

1365
01:52:18,335 --> 01:52:20,236
        [gasping]

1366
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:36,120
        [breathing heavily]

1367
01:52:38,256 --> 01:52:40,091
            [wailing]

1368
01:52:52,666 --> 01:52:55,766
    [groaning, screaming]

1369
01:52:55,801 --> 01:52:57,108
        [screaming stops]
