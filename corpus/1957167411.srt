That was really cool

I think Presley liked it too
I mean, she loved it.

Hey, um... How are y...

1202

How are you feeling about all that?
Because I know it can be...

1203
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,508
overwhelming.

1204
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,843
It was amazing.

01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,261

I don't know.

Just, can you wait just like two seconds?
I have something for you.

1217
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,884
- Oh yeah, sure.
- But just two seconds, okay?

I just wanted you to have this photo.

You don't have to keep it if it's weird.
I just, um...

Hey, lover boy. How's Avery?

1237
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,136
She gave me this.

1238
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,890
Aww.

1239
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,726
Man, I look good in this.
Mind if I steal it?

1240
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,311
Yeah, I do. [chuckles]

Thanks.

Oh, wow, are those your parents?

That's them.

- Yeah.
- Really?

- You got a lot of peach fuzz though.
- Peach fuzz? [chuckles]

1252

Will, your mother is beautiful.

1253
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,469
She really is.

would be really proud of you.

a heartfelt score, it was so tender.

Nice, George.

1259
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,956
You know what would be heartfelt?
If you picked up your drawers.

[George] Mom.
Come on, I just wore them.

Do you expect me
to clean my room at camp?

1262
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,839
- [Kristin] Why does it smell so bad?
- [George] Boys only.

[Kristin] That boy stink
that just sticks on you.

[George] They smell like old people.

1265

[Kristin] I can smell your shorts.
How long you been wearing them?

1266
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:39,930
[George] They were pants.

We didn't come this far to be just okay.

Okay, we're a team. But, yes,

It'll be nice to have
some decent talent show competition.

- Yeah, this is a closed rehearsal, Sean.
- I'm aware.

1297
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:36,422
I heard the new kid would be playing
a big part in this year's performance.

01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,216
So I wanted to stop by
and offer a few pointers.

Will, got a minute?

I'm sorry, I just...

Hey, you're good. You're good.

- Why? What's up?
- I don't know.

1323
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,796
We were trying to rehearse,
Sean walked in, said something to him

1324
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,714
and then Will just walked out.

1325
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,425
W-wait, Sean? What did Sean say?

1326
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,593

I mean, that's faith, right?</i>

I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

1342

He's lying to you.
You've gotta believe me.
