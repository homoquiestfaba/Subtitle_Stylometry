155
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:09,117
         [hilda laughs]

156
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,353
   well, only time will tell.

157
00:05:11,388 --> 00:05:14,289
              [♪♪♪]

158
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:16,458
           all right.
        Well, this is it.

159
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:17,859
            What time
     does your flight leave?

160
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:19,461
       Not until tonight.

161
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,229
 I figured I'd go check out some
  of the sights that we missed.

162
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:22,564
           Wait, wait.

163
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,099
            You guys,
 the light is really good here.

164
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:25,467
  Can we take one last picture

165
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:27,402
           before we--

166
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:28,536
          -she's ready.
      -You know me so well.

167
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:29,604
              Okay.

168
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,872
        I should by now.

169
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,307
              Um...

170
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:33,908
           -All right.
           -All right.

171
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:35,377
   Wait. Can you see the veil?

172
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:36,411
          I can see it.

173
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,612
       There we go. One...

174
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:38,546
           Two, three!

175
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:39,714
             [snap]

176
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,250
      aw, we look so happy.

177
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,618
    Oh. Just like in college.

178
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,986
             [tracy]
    except with better hair.

179
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,221
 Are you talking about my bangs?

180
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,056
  Your "mall bangs," you mean?
          Those bangs?

181
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,158
      Do you guys remember
 the very first selfie we took,

182
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:52,227
           in front of
 that old house that we rented?

183
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:53,161
         Oh, that house
        was falling down.

184
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,996
  Yes! But we had so much fun.

185
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:57,065
     It's still standing...
        Just like we are.

186
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,133
           I love you.

187
00:05:58,168 --> 00:05:59,734
        I love you, too.

188
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,803
       All right, this is
the part of the weekend I hate--

189
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:03,138
         saying goodbye.

190
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:06,408
       Calling and zooming
  can't compare to a real hug.

191
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,343
   These goodbyes last longer
        than the weekend.

192
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:09,611
 We have to get to the airport.

193
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,812
         -[laughs] okay.
           -All right.

194
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,514
    I miss you guys already.

195
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,450
    Well, maybe we'll see you
      at your wedding, huh?

196
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,952
             -Oh...
 -Your<i> two</i> maids of honor. Two!

197
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,255
         -I heard that!
              -Bye!

198
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,322
              Aww.

199
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,124
     Hi. I just checked out,

200
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,093
 but I was hoping I could leave
   my things here for the day?

201
00:06:25,128 --> 00:06:26,127
           Of course.

202
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:28,129
     What a beautiful veil.

203
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:30,298
         -Oh, thank you.
   -I'll take good care of it.

204
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,766
       Thank you so much.

205
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:35,170
               Oh!

206
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,677
      Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

207
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:43,812
     I think this is my cab.

208
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:44,846
   Uh, pretty sure it's mine.

209
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:46,448
         -Based on what?
         -The fact that

210
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:47,882
        I held my arm out
  and the cab coming to a stop?

211
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,217
         How do you know
     he didn't stop for me?

212
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,819
    I have really long arms.

213
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,120
              Uh...

214
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,021
            [laughs]

215
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:54,522
       uh, you know what?

216
00:06:54,558 --> 00:06:56,724
     Why don't you take it?

217
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:59,894
       Unless, of course,
   you think chivalry is dead.

218
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,129
      Very gallant of you.

219
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,730
          Gallant? Wow.

220
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,732
     Nobody's ever called me
        "gallant" before.

221
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:05,733
       Well, how many cabs
       have you given up?

222
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:07,502
       Clearly not enough.

223
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,703
           [chuckles]

224
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,205
           thank you.

225
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,173
           No problem.

226
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,217
              [♪♪♪]

227
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:37,265
      guess we didn't need
       two cabs after all.

228
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,000
     [chuckles] I guess not.

229
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:41,503
        So, is this fate
         or coincidence?

230
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:43,104
          I don't know.

231
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,405
     I guess we'll find out.

232
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,940
           [chuckles]

233
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,358
  I thought I was the only one
who read the entire description.

234
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,794
        Yeah, no, I know.
  Some people find it annoying.

235
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:08,730
  Yeah, which is why I usually
      go to museums alone.

236
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,033
    I go alone. All the time.

237
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,134
            -Really?
             -Yeah.

238
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:14,402
        I mean, it's not
    that I don't have friends

239
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:15,436
      to go with, I just--

240
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:16,571
   you just want to keep 'em.

241
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:18,706
     [laughs] yeah, exactly.

242
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:22,644
              Uh...

243
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:30,985
         Hey. You, uh..
  Do you have any plans after--

244
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,053
           after this?

245
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,755
    What'd you have in mind?

246
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,225
      Well, I was planning
     on smelling the roses.

247
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,596
         Wait. I thought
  you were being philosophical,

248
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,332
     but you literally just
   wanted to smell the roses?

249
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:46,301
 Yeah. I'm a literal kinda guy.

250
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,102
         -Good to know.
       -Why don't you try?

251
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,237
              Okay.

252
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,907
            Mm. Nice.

253
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:55,743
              So...

254
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,513
 You wanna call this "fate" yet?

255
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,415
        I say we go with,
     you know, "coincidence"

256
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,783
      and see how it goes.

257
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:03,484
            Ah. Okay.

258
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,587
  Well, we have cabs, museums--

259
00:09:05,622 --> 00:09:06,821
              -yes.
             -Roses.

260
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:07,789
 What else do we have in common?

261
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:08,856
       Walks in the rain?

262
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,959
   If I have an umbrella, yes.

263
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:12,293
          Cats or dogs?

264
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:13,995
              Oh...

265
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,130
       No, I can't choose.
        I like 'em both.

266
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,498
        Oh, extra points
        for that answer.

267
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:18,533
   All right. Favorite movie.

268
00:09:18,602 --> 00:09:19,934
     <i> When harry met sally.</i>

269
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,202
   And this is a deal-breaker,
      if you don't like it.

270
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,971
  I watch that movie every day.

271
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,872
           [laughing]

272
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,376
     so, um, what brings you
        to san francisco?

273
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,812
   A reunion with two friends
          from college.

274
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,113
       We meet once a year

275
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,115
        and go antiquing
      in a different city.

276
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,984
         What about you?
  Why are you in san francisco?

277
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,151
           A wedding.

278
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:39,053
  Oh, the wedding at the hotel?

279
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:40,488
      Yeah. Yeah, I thought

280
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:42,457
        I'd stick around
    and do a bit sightseeing.

281
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,893
      I'm glad that I did.

282
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,564
  So you don't have to be back
  at work early in the morning?

283
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,166
          No. I kind of
       make my own hours.

284
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:53,568
         Oh, lucky you.

285
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,169
    So you're self-employed?

286
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,905
           Yeah. Well,
    it's something like that.

287
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:58,973
      Are you gonna make me
       guess what you do?

288
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,042
      No, why don't I guess
          what you do?

289
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,844
        Oh, so secretive.
         Are you a spy?

290
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,545
       No, I'm not a spy.

291
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:06,314
     Yep. I knew it. A spy.

292
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:09,050
         A spy who likes
       to smell the roses.

293
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,353
         Are you hungry?

294
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,222
        Me, I'm starving.

295
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:15,823
          I could eat.

296
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:17,992
              [♪♪♪]

297
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:22,330
           [avery] mm.

298
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,065
     Okay, this is so good.

299
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,533
   Yeah. You can really taste,

300
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:28,369
 like, the nutmeg and the cumin
    and that gruyere cheese.

301
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:30,038
         Mm-hmm. I think
   you just tipped your hand.

302
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:31,372
         You're a chef.

303
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:33,207
          [laughs] no.

304
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:34,676
      You're a food critic?

305
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,611
       Only when it comes
       to mac and cheese.

306
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,212
    There's a place in boston
            I go to--

307
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:39,881
         it's got, like,
      21 different flavors.

308
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,516
       I've tried 'em all.

309
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,419
              What?

310
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:45,353
       You live in boston?

311
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:47,588
        Born and raised.

312
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:48,690
        I live in boston.

313
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,425
              Okay.

314
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,461
     I think that it's time
  that we called this fate now.

315
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,629
            Maybe so.

316
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:55,730
  There's no "maybe" about it.

317
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:56,964
           Maybe not.

318
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:00,134
           All right.

319
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:01,803
           It's fate.

320
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,574
 I had a really nice time today.

321
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,210
          Yeah. Me too.
  I'm so glad you stole my cab.

322
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:10,545
            So am I.

323
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,148
          So we, uh...
  We'll pick this up in boston?

324
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:16,050
     All the mac and cheese
          you can eat.

325
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:16,984
       I would love that.

326
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,454
          [phone rings]

327
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:22,824
       oh, I gotta-- sor--
       I gotta take this.

328
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,592
           Oh. C.I.A.

329
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:25,760
      [as michael corleone]
   just when I think I'm out,

330
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:26,761
      they pull me back in!

331
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,730
           [chuckles]

332
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:30,131
 hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

333
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,936
       Oh. Perfect timing.
       Thank you so much.

334
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,337
     I'd love to have a veil
         just like this

335
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,839
       when I get married.

336
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,073
           Thank you.
       It's one of a kind.

337
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,075
       And I feel so lucky
        to have found it.

338
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,310
     [concierge] do you have
       a dress picked out?

339
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:45,246
        Uh, no, the veil
 is all I can handle right now.

340
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,749
 [concierge] well, you're going
   to make a beautiful bride.

341
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:48,950
        Oh, I'm actually
      not getting married,

342
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,084
       I just-- I saw it,

343
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,787
      it was so beautiful,
       I couldn't resist.

344
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:53,988
     -Well, it is beautiful.
           -Thank you.

345
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,824
    Can you take that for us?

346
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,992
           Thank you.

347
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:00,962
        Hey, so, do you--

348
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,197
   do you want to share a cab
   back to the airport, or...?

349
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,134
      Uh, no. I don't think
   that would be appropriate.

350
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,502
            Why not?

351
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:11,139
       Um... I gotta pack.

352
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,441
       Have a nice flight.

353
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,343
        Nice meeting you.

354
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,047
       [exhales, stunned]

355
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,383
            I thought
    that was your boyfriend.

356
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:26,120
  No. I don't have a boyfriend
         and... [sighs]

357
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,688
          ...If I did,
       it wouldn't be him.

358
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,696
       [avery] hey, emma.

359
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:37,165
           [emma]<i> hey.</i>
      <i> I got your message.</i>

360
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,199
        <i> Everything okay?</i>

361
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:39,634
    Yeah, I'm fine. You know.

362
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:41,135
      I just wanted to call
         and touch base.

363
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,904
  Well, I'm in between classes,

364
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,872
        so I've got time
     for a couple of bases.

365
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:47,575
 San francisco was so much fun,
       but you know what?

366
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:48,676
   It really got me thinking.

367
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,211
      I know what you mean.

368
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:53,047
   Every time we get together,
I start taking stock of my life.

369
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,682
            You know,
    where I was when we met,

370
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,484
        where I'm going.

371
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,186
     [chuckles] my thoughts
  were a little less profound.

372
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,087
         <i> [laughs] okay.</i>

373
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,556
    So, after you guys left,

374
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:03,658
          <i> I met a guy.</i>

375
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:05,827
              What?

376
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,662
 <i> Do you think it was the veil?</i>

377
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:08,663
       No. It was a bust.

378
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:09,897
               Oh!

379
00:13:09,933 --> 00:13:11,098
       <i> How could I get it</i>

380
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,200
            so wrong?

381
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:13,501
  He seemed so nice at first--

382
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:15,903
         he was so funny
     and witty and charming.

383
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,205
        <i> Very attractive.</i>

384
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,940
    You know, that's exactly
          what you said

385
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,708
 about your last two boyfriends,
             right?

386
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:23,244
  I guess I've gotta get rid of
   these rose-colored glasses.

387
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,546
      <i> [laughs] no. Just...</i>
           <i> You know--</i>

388
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:27,215
    learn from your mistakes.

389
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,418
  Every relationship that fails
  is just an opportunity for us

390
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:33,688
  to know more about ourselves
     and what we want and...

391
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:35,756
      Oh, who am I kidding?

392
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,392
 Even my overly-protected heart
 is just gonna do its own thing.

393
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,727
            [laughs]

394
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:41,863
     all right, we can cover
     the other bases later.

395
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:42,864
      <i> Go teach your class.</i>

396
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,565
           Okay. Bye.

397
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,533
            <i> Goodbye.</i>

398
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,537
         Morning, jason.

399
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:51,539
            Morning.

400
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:56,244
          Hey! Mornin'.

401
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,478
             [thump]

402
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,081
    sorry to dump this on you
      your first day back.

403
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,582
        What is all this?

404
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,084
  Well, since you're heading up
       the gala this year,

405
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,752
          sonya thought
      it would be "helpful"

406
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:06,087
 if you looked through the files
      from previous years.

407
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:08,656
   Oh. This is quite a stack.

408
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,558
   They were pretty big galas.

409
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,961
    And if you pull this off,

410
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:15,897
        you're gonna get
         the promotion.

411
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:17,632
           This is how
  you prove yourself to sonya.

412
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,735
  And what extraordinary feats

413
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,236
          do you think
   jason will have to perform?

414
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,272
        I'm sure he's got
   a few feats up his sleeve.

415
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,740
              Hmm.

416
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,341
  -That didn't come out right--
           -[laughing]

417
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,743
   ...But you know how he is.

418
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,311
      Oh! I forgot to ask.

419
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:31,512
       How was your trip?

420
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,014
      It was best of times,

421
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,582
    it was the most confusing
            of times,

422
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,117
    but it was pretty great.

423
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:37,518
      How was your weekend?

424
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,121
        What did you do?
            [gasping]

425
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:43,257
       jeff proposed to me
in the middle of a celtics game.

426
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,292
 [squeals] ah! Oh, my goodness.

427
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:45,660
      I'm so happy for you!

428
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,361
        Oh, look at this.

429
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,330
       This is beautiful.
   Okay, we have to celebrate.

430
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,631
         Do you wanna do
       drinks after work?

431
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,366
          Yes! Perfect.

432
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:55,636
             Jason.

433
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:57,805
              Lucy.

434
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,941
       [sonya] uh, jason?

435
00:14:59,976 --> 00:15:02,376
        What's the status
   of your children's program?

436
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,979
    Several elementary school
 classes have already signed up.

437
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:06,447
         And I was able
     to book charles palmer

438
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:07,982
           from n.Y.U.

439
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,216
       For the first talk.

440
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,285
   He's aware all the students
        are all under 12?

441
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,020
    I chose professor palmer

442
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:14,889
       because he created
          a successful

443
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,190
     interactive art program
      specifically tailored

444
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,358
          to pre-teens.

445
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,160
         Sounds perfect.

446
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,828
    I also wanted to announce

447
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:23,230
      that the president of
 the hastings family foundation

448
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:24,999
   will be joining our board.

449
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,734
         The foundation
     has primarily supported

450
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,502
      science and research
          non-profits,

451
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,171
        but mr. Hastings
  wants to become more involved

452
00:15:30,206 --> 00:15:33,040
      in the art community
         and the museum.

453
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,576
 Mr. Hastings has hosted several
    galas for his foundation.

454
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:37,211
  He's offered us his services

455
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:39,146
        and I'd like you
        to work with him.

456
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,648
           Absolutely.
      I look forward to it.

457
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:43,584
         Unless someone
      has anything else...

458
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:44,852
       I think we're good.

459
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:47,388
    I would like to email you

460
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:49,824
        some ideas I have
        for new projects.

461
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:51,759
    Great. I'll take a look.

462
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,428
     That guy is relentless.

463
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:56,764
  Well, it seems to be working.

464
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,233
      So have you and jeff
           set a date?

465
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:00,701
           Next month.

466
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:02,403
         Wh-- I'm sorry.

467
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,172
   It's really loud out here.
  Did you just say next month?

468
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,208
          Yes, I know,
  I know what you're thinking.

469
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:09,377
          It seems like
   we're rushing into things,

470
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,746
        but I don't want
     to wait another minute.

471
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:13,948
     The sooner, the better.
           I love it.

472
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,282
              Good.

473
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:16,450
 Because there's so much to do.

474
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,220
      Okay, my brother said
       he would pitch in,

475
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,055
 and my mom's not gonna be here
  until the day of the wedding,

476
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,424
   so I really need your help.

477
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,226
          Well, this is
     the easiest ask ever--

478
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:26,794
    weddings are in my genes.

479
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:28,362
            I figured
    you would know what to do

480
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,131
      and I don't even know
         where to begin.

481
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,465
  Are you sure you don't mind?

482
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,200
     I'm running out of ways
           to say yes!

483
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,135
           Thank you.

484
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,703
          Yes! Cheers!

485
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:36,871
    Cheers. Now I can relax.

486
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:37,872
        Congratulations.

487
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,206
           Thank you.

488
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:42,910
  Yeah, this is gonna be great.

489
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,980
        Okay, maybe just
 a few more inches to the left?

490
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,314
            Perfect.

491
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:48,783
      All right, you guys,
   I have to get to a meeting,

492
00:16:48,818 --> 00:16:50,584
          so I'll have
      to finish this later,

493
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,452
   but this is looking great.

494
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:56,157
  The stanbridge is so grateful
   to have your participation.

495
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,224
          [door opens]

496
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,325
             avery!

497
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,061
          I'd like you
     to meet peter hastings.

498
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:02,430
 Peter will be working with you
          on the gala.

499
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:03,497
         [phone ringing]

500
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,598
           uh... Lucy.

501
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:05,633
      Hi, I'm in a meeting.

502
00:17:05,668 --> 00:17:07,568
          Oh! Oh, okay.
      I'll be right there.

503
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,237
       The henri rousseau
   that's on loan from the met

504
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:11,272
          just arrived.

505
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,406
        I'm the only one
      who can sign for it.

506
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,774
         Yeah, you can't
      keep the met waiting.

507
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,109
       No. Certainly not.

508
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:16,677
       I'll be right back.

509
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,012
        In the meantime,
   you two can get acquainted.

510
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,517
       What are the odds?

511
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,653
       Oh, don't you dare
      bring fate into this.

512
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:27,955
    W-why didn't you tell me
 who you were when we first met?

513
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,791
        It tends to color
   people's impression of me.

514
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,993
 Oh, no, my impression of you is
  that you were very secretive,

515
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,195
  and, ha, that hasn't changed.

516
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,598
      I never lied to you.
            I just...

517
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,100
     Left a few things out.

518
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,367
           Yeah, like
    what you do for a living?

519
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:43,137
        "philanthropist"?
Sounds a bit stuffy, doesn't it?

520
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,805
   Besides, it's not who I am.

521
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:47,208
   Oh, yeah, no, 'cause you're
  the guy who smells the roses

522
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,676
       and enjoys 20 kinds
       of mac and cheese.

523
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,344
 21... Kinds of mac and cheese.

524
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,480
   Oh, I'm sorry. My mistake.

525
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:54,715
             [sonya]
 I hope I didn't miss anything.

526
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,050
      No. W-we were just--

527
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,384
      we were just getting
      to know one another.

528
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,652
           If one can

529
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,287
       truly know anybody
   in a short amount of time.

530
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:01,989
     Apparently not as well
         as you'd think.

531
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:03,524
   I'm afraid you've lost me.

532
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,725
       We were just saying

533
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,893
        "how do you know
  if you really know someone?"

534
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,161
      you know? [chuckles]

535
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:08,362
            exactly!

536
00:18:09,632 --> 00:18:12,199
       At least you're on
     the same wavelength...

537
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,634
   ...Whatever that might be.

538
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,069
              Um...

539
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,904
          Let's go over
   some of the preliminaries.

540
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,639
           Absolutely.
    So there are some things

541
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:20,207
    that need to be finalized
     in the next few weeks--

542
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,909
         like, a theme,

543
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:23,711
     and, uh, catering and--

544
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:24,812
   can I assume that the gala

545
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:26,013
     is going to take place
         at the museum?

546
00:18:26,048 --> 00:18:27,047
          Well, unless
     you have a better idea?

547
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,382
       I just find museums
          can be, uh...

548
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,417
         A bit confusing
        for some people.

549
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:31,652
        [avery] even one
    you might want to forget.

550
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:32,987
    [both chuckling, forced]

551
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,088
        where do you want
        to have the gala?

552
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,189
             I think
     we should have it here.

553
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:36,223
             Me too.

554
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:37,858
          Okay, great.
       We agree. We agree.

555
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:39,059
        [peter] we agree.

556
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,261
         Totally agree.

557
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,863
        I'm glad we've...
      Got that worked out.

558
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:43,864
              Yeah.

559
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,666
             Me too.

560
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,869
    You know that girl I met
        in san francisco?

561
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,404
 Yeah, the one you really liked?

562
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,605
          Yeah, the one
     that forgot to mention

563
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:53,240
  that she was getting married.

564
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:54,842
   [chuckles] what about her?

565
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,443
        Well, I just had
    a meeting at stanbridge.

566
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:57,745
          It turns out
     that she's the curator

567
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,079
       I'm be working with
          on the gala.

568
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:00,281
           Seriously?

569
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,416
        Ooh. That must've
       been uncomfortable.

570
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,851
  Yeah, and she seemed to imply

571
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,553
       that I was the one
     that was in the wrong.

572
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:08,088
  So, is it gonna be a problem
        working with her?

573
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,557
    No. No, I've been wanting

574
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,425
   to do something outside of
   the foundation for a while.

575
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,726
            You know,
    get more involved in art,

576
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:14,295
      so I'm just-- I'm not
     gonna let it bother me.

577
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,063
  You mean let her bother you.

578
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:18,599
  We're two strangers who spent
 a little bit of time together.

579
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:19,967
   We hardly know each other.

580
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:21,936
 Besides, she's getting married.
       End of discussion.

581
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:23,637
       Hey, you're the one
   that keeps bringing her up.

582
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,641
   [emma]<i> so the guy you'll be</i>
  <i> working with is the same guy</i>

583
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,109
    you met in san francisco?

584
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:30,811
        That's hilarious.

585
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,246
  Yeah, well, neither one of us
           thought so.

586
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:35,616
      I was hoping the veil
  had better judgment than me.

587
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,619
 That is putting a lot of faith
     in some bedazzled lace.

588
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:40,120
           Oh, I think
      you guys were right.

589
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,622
       Hilda oversold it.

590
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:42,923
       <i> So who's the guy?</i>

591
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,325
         Peter hastings.

592
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,460
 He runs his family's foundation
         here in boston.

593
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,562
   He's one of<i> those</i> hastings?

594
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:49,563
         [avery]<i> uh-huh.</i>

595
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,831
         The university
       has a research lab

596
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,066
  with his family's name on it.

597
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:53,834
    [tracy]<i> didn't you google</i>
           <i> this guy?</i>

598
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,269
             Well--

599
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,071
    his father started one of
   the first biotech companies

600
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:58,639
         in the country.

601
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:00,608
   <i> Well, his father should've</i>
 <i> taught his son better manners.</i>

602
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:01,675
       <i> I mean, you don't</i>
        <i> run into a woman</i>

603
00:20:01,744 --> 00:20:03,310
      <i> and call it "fate,"</i>

604
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:05,613
<i>and then just hop on an elevator</i>
<i>with a lame, "nice meeting you."</i>

605
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:06,680
             -oh...
          <i> -Seriously?</i>

606
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:07,982
              Yeah.

607
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,750
     It's too bad you can't
    google a guy's sincerity.

608
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,318
     Ah, that's what I like
           about finn.

609
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,486
        He is a good guy,

610
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:13,921
        <i> he's dependable,</i>

611
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,589
          and he never
     throws me a curveballs.

612
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,125
      Mm. Who're you trying
          to convince?

613
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,927
         <i> No convincing.</i>

614
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:23,197
    <i> A little compromising...</i>

615
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,966

        <i> halfway, right?</i>

616
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:27,601
        Okay. Fair point.

617
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:28,836
        Oh, I should go.

618
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:30,771
       Tomorrow's gonna be
    a really complicated day.

619
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,640
      <i> Focus on the prize--</i>

620
00:20:32,675 --> 00:20:33,874
       <i> and the promotion.</i>

621
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,376
     Yeah. No, I'll be fine.

622
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,644
     I just have to get over
        the embarrassment

623
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:37,678
      of seeing him again.

624
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:40,114
  <i> Okay, talk to you guys soon.</i>

625
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:42,149
            [smooch]
            goodbye.

626
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:48,022
 Maybe true love doesn't exist.

627
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:52,526
    Yeah, I like the length.

628
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,894
       What do you think?

629
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:56,297
             [gasps]

630
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,366
        oh, look at you.
    That dress is perfection.

631
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,302
     Do you really think so?

632
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,870
       Yes. It's bad luck
       to lie to a bride.

633
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:07,074
           Oh! Oh, oh.
        That is very you.

634
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:08,542
           You think?

635
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,544
 Kind of thought it would match
     the antique veil I got.

636
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,047
           Which is...
     Which is hard to match.

637
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,518
    Maybe I'm hard to match.

638
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:19,920
          You are not.

639
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,555
   I've been to more weddings
        than I can count

640
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,357
        and I have never
       caught the bouquet.

641
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:25,426
      Well, maybe your luck
       is about to change.

642
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:26,593
              Hmm.

643
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,262
      I have very good aim.

644
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:29,930
 All right, what's our next stop
           after this?

645
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,832
       Okay, we have a few
      cake-tastings to do,

646
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,167
         but... [sighs]

647
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:35,102
          I'm not sure
  we're gonna have enough time.

648
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,171
     I don't want to take up
     your whole lunch break.

649
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,672
          What's better
  than wedding cake for lunch?

650
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,341
        And I don't have
     to be back until 2:00.

651
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:43,577
        I have a meeting
      with peter hastings.

652
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:45,713
       Oh? What's he like?

653
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:48,248
      I mean, besides being
   handsome, rich, and single?

654
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:51,285
         Let's just say
      he runs hot and cold.

655
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:55,289
    Oh! Oh, this is so good.

656
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:57,891
  I'll have what she's having.

657
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,693
       Is it 2:00 already?

658
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:02,029
      No, the board meeting
         got out early.

659
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:03,864
       Well, we're tasting
         wedding cakes.

660
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,099
            Join us.

661
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,301
          Have a piece?

662
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,236
             Or six.

663
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:11,238
    Actually, we could really
      use a man's opinion.

664
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:12,306
      What about the groom?

665
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,374
      Oh, he's out of town.

666
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,143
          Okay. Um...?

667
00:22:17,313 --> 00:22:18,946
         -Try that one.
           -This one?

668
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,117
      Oh, it's too lemony.

669
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:24,551
     Well, it's lemon cake.

670
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,720
        Try the coconut.

671
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:31,091
             -Maybe.
           -All right.

672
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,793
    Try the chocolate mocha.
         I can't decide.

673
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,298
       That's the winner.

674
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:39,800
          Right there.

675
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:41,068
       Guys always go for
         the chocolate.

676
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,803
      We're interchangeable
             to you?

677
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:43,937
     When it comes to cake,
            you are.

678
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:45,839
       [cell phone chimes]

679
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,174
        I gotta check out
        the installation.

680
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,143
       I'll be right back.

681
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,982
  So, um, when is the wedding?

682
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,350
           Four weeks.

683
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,985
       -[fork hits table]
      -can you believe it?

684
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,920
       Wow! That's, um...

685
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:01,789
          That's soon.

686
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,191
       You're telling me!

687
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:07,361
    Uh, can you do me a favor

688
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,596
     and just let avery know
     just to meet me inside?

689
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,532
     Oh, but you're not done
           your cake.

690
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,333
     Uh, I lost my appetite.

691
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:19,940
        [avery] perfect.
           Thank you.

692
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:24,878
       You are so right--

693
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,380
    he does run hot and cold.

694
00:23:26,449 --> 00:23:27,981
              See?

695
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,450
              Yeah.

696
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,318
             [avery]
  okay, so you're gonna get me

697
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:32,719
your foundation's list of donors

698
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,155
         and then I will
  cross-reference it with ours.

699
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:38,058
  Attendance tends to increase
   when the gala has a theme.

700
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:39,560
            Oh, true.

701
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:42,129
 The more fun people are having,
    the bigger the donations.

702
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,031
   Mm-hmm. Yeah, we could do,
         uh, mardi gras?

703
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:45,899
  Everybody loves a masquerade.

704
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,635
   Yeah, it's fun to dress up
 and pretend to be someone else,

705
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:50,370
  but we have done that before.

706
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:51,538
   [pointedly] well, you have.

707
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:54,174
        [confused] okay.

708
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,577
         What about a...
    What about a magic theme?

709
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,178
     You know, we could have
        magicians around,

710
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:00,180
       performing tricks,

711
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,982
          and you could
    volunteer to disappear--

712
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:03,517
            [mutters]
  ...Since you're good at that.

713
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:04,918
      Only when I feel like
     I don't have a choice.

714
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,855
        I'm... Gonna have
        to wrap this up.

715
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,023
             Sure...

716
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:12,493
      You've got a busy day
      of planning a wedding

717
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,262
      and planning a gala.

718
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:16,930
            Mm. Well,
     I'm a good multitasker.

719
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,365
           Obviously.

720
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,667
          Don't forget
   to get me your list, okay?

721
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:25,339
              Okay.

722
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,675
      Oh, this looks great.

723
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:32,045
 But something about this bench
       is kind of generic,

724
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,114
   it kind of ruins the mood.

725
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:35,949
   What did you have in mind?

726
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,418
    I just want the visitors
       to sit on something

727
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,754
   that reflects the exhibit,
            you know?

728
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,222
      There's some benches
        in the basement.

729
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:43,557
     We can get it tomorrow?

730
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:44,925
    We're about to clock out.

731
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,460
       I'll go down there
        and take a look.

732
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,595
   Have a good evening, guys.

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,779

740
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:14,448
       The security guard
       said she just left.

741
00:26:14,483 --> 00:26:15,649
 I just saw her drive off, yeah.

742
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:16,984
         [sighs heavily]

743
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,385
    what are you doing here?

744
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,153
         I left my phone
     in the conference room.

745
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:23,890
 I think I just stumbled across
   a very important painting.

746
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,859
           Come look.

747
00:26:27,229 --> 00:26:29,496
  This better be a masterpiece.

748
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:32,232
  Oh, it's hard to be certain,
  it's in such poor condition,

749
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:33,367
             but...

750
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:35,502
 I think it's by claudio amici.

751
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,870
    The 19th-century painter?

752
00:26:36,905 --> 00:26:38,839
           Impressive.

753
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,476
        I've seen some of
  his paintings at the louvre.

754
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:44,144
  Yeah, I saw one at the getty.

       It's not unheard of
       for museums to find

756
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:48,482
  long-forgotten pieces of art.

757
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:49,850
     This would-- this would
  actually bring a lot of press

758
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:50,884
         to the museum.

759
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:52,152
    Yeah, if it's authentic.

760
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:53,487
  So I'm gonna do some research

761
00:26:53,522 --> 00:26:55,489
   and see if I can figure out
       where it came from.

          Wow. You must
      really like van gogh.

769
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:21,748
       I saw this painting
         when I was 12.

770
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:25,786
     It was my first real...
     "wow" moment over art.

771
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:27,387
   I remember my first "wow".

772
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:30,257
     Was, um... Well, it was
      the western artists.

773
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,625
   My father was a collector,

774
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,061
       so he introduced me
 to thomas moran and remington.

  those paintings made me want
to be a cowboy when I was a kid.

779
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,938
         I, um, I think
       I found something.

780
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:49,276
       There's a painting
      that's listed here...

790
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,862
             it says
   it was gifted to the museum

791
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:11,198
 by a private collector in 1963,

792
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,166
           but there's
      no other information.

793
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:14,334
   I mean, every piece of art

794
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:16,169
    is supposed to be tagged
         and catalogued.

795
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,940
         You know what?
         I have a hunch.

796
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:23,543
      The museum underwent
    some renovations in 1963,

797
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,312
         and they built
  a new off-site storage vault

798
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:26,313
        for the artwork.

799
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:27,514
            So, what?

800
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:30,817
    You think that they left
        the amici behind?

801
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:33,653
 Well, if it came to the museum
     during the renovation,

802
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,122
       I mean, there were
     no computers back then.

803
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:36,490
Everything was entered manually.

804
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,225
       It could've slipped
       through the cracks.

        a huge discovery.

        to figure us out.

     Yeah, well... So am I.

848
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,987
    Uh... Okay. So, my idea.

849
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,755
  I have an idea for the gala,

850
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,091
      and I know it's gonna
    sound a little ambitious,

851
00:30:18,126 --> 00:30:19,559
             but...

852
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:20,727
        I was thinking--

853
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:23,230
   what if we unveil the amici
          at the gala?

854
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,933
  I don't know, that painting's
      in pretty bad shape.

855
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,802
        Yeah, but what if
    it was restored in time?

856
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:32,105
   I think it's a great idea.

857
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,141
But you're gonna have to present
    a proposal to the board.

858
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:37,344
       Oh, no, no, no, no.
   Not-- not-- not me. Sonya.

859
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:39,412
   I'm not a full curator yet,

860
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:43,016
  and associates don't usually
      go before the board.

861
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:45,118
         Are you hoping
   on becoming a full curator?

862
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:47,754
 Yeah, it's always been my goal.

863
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:49,656
            You know,
    my father had a saying--

864
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,358
        that you can wait
      for things to happen,

865
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:53,660
           or you can
   make thing happen yourself.

866
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,097
        Ugh, and what if
       they turn me down?

867
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:58,131
              Tch.

868
00:30:58,166 --> 00:31:00,033
    I never thought of that.

869
00:31:01,603 --> 00:31:03,103
             -But...
            -[laughs]

870
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:05,105
        there is one vote

871
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,340
 that you can probably count on.

872
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,646
     If we unveil the amici
          at the gala,

873
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,481
     it could bring a lot of
    attention to the museum.

874
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,549
         It could boost
     our fundraising efforts

875
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:17,784
   and people would get to see

876
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:18,818
          a work of art
   that's long been forgotten.

877
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:19,986
        Can you guarantee

878
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,389
        that the painting
    will be restored in time?

879
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:24,024
              I...

880
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,559
  If we announce the unveiling
 and the restoration isn't done,

881
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,295
         it would damage
    the museum's reputation.

882
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,063
      [avery] I understand,

883
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:31,398
       and I've consulted
     with frederick neumann,

884
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,333
  who's worked with the museum
          for 17 years,

885
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:34,701
     and he feels confident

886
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,336
   that he could have the work
      done by our deadline.

887
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:37,637
       I know it's a risk,

888
00:31:37,673 --> 00:31:38,872
             but...

889
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:40,573
    It's a risk worth taking.

890
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:41,908
      "portrait of a bride"

891
00:31:41,977 --> 00:31:43,143
      is an incredible work

892
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,245
          by an artist
 who deserves to be recognized.

893
00:31:46,715 --> 00:31:48,315
    It's been in the basement
          long enough.

00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:04,698
              And?

898
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,233

00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,048
         Wow. That's...

908
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:25,018
    That's all because you--
   you pushed me to go for it.

909
00:32:25,053 --> 00:32:26,386
       Thank you for that.

910
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:29,522
         Well, I, um...

911
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,691
 I'll let you get back to work.

912
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,593
        [chuckles] okay.

913
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,230
     Hey, who do you think's
    gonna read that, anyways?

914
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:39,432
  I know two people who would.

915
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:43,470
              -Hi.
              -Hey.

916
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:49,976
  Well, peter's in a good mood.

917
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:52,712
       He's so wonderful,
      and then he's just...

918
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:54,147
     Like, all of a sudden,
       a different person.

919
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,250
       Maybe you can date
          half of him.

920
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:58,885
        There's an idea.

921
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,886
           [laughing]

922
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:01,221
          okay, listen.

923
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:03,323
     My brother wants to get
     the dj for the wedding,

924
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:05,458
           but we have
 very different taste in music.

925
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:08,094
        Mine being good,
        his, not so much.

926
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,496
          I didn't want
      to hurt his feelings,

927
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,598
          so I told him
      to consult with you.

928
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:14,067
       Well, I lean more,
       you know, romantic.

929
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,469
         Well, he leans
        more, like, loud.

930
00:33:16,505 --> 00:33:18,671
          Don't worry.
       We'll work it out.

931
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:23,576
        The good news...

932
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:28,581
     Is the layers of grime
   seem to have protected it.

933
00:33:28,617 --> 00:33:30,083
        And the bad news?

934
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:31,818
      The layers of grime.

935
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,453
           [chuckles]

936
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:37,424
   yeah, each one needs to be
      painstakingly cleaned

937
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:40,093
          before I even
      address the varnish.

938
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:42,295
       But it can be done
  in time for the gala, right?

939
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,765
  I set aside my other projects
    to make this a priority.

940
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:48,468
             It's...

941
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:52,138
        It's interesting
     how amici painted her.

942
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:53,673
        What do you mean?

943
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:56,276
      She seems awfully sad
         to be a bride.

944
00:33:56,311 --> 00:33:58,878
    [peter] well, even though
        she looks sad...

945
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:01,448
    She is a beautiful bride.

946
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,049
            Mm. Yeah.
    All brides are beautiful.

947
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:04,517
      [frederick chuckles]

948
00:34:06,221 --> 00:34:07,854
       thank you so much.

949
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:09,189
               Mm.

950
00:34:09,224 --> 00:34:10,557
      I was just thinking--

951
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,893
     since this is gonna be
  the centerpiece of the gala,

952
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:16,162
       what if we made it
        a wedding theme?

953
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:18,665
      What, is one wedding
       not enough for you?

954
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,233
     Well, we're almost done
          planning it.

955
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,634
     Are you sure you're not
       taking on too much?

956
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,136
       The more weddings,
          the merrier!

957
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:24,838
    Plus, all the mocha cake
          you can eat.

958
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,978
            Oh, hey.
     I started without you.

959
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:34,147
         Oh, I just love
      planning weddings...

960
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:36,382
           Even though
   this isn't a real wedding.

961
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,084
        Well, I've never
      been married before,

962
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,919
 so I don't have any experience.

963
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,454
         I'm surprised.

964
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,489
        That I don't have
         any experience

965
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:43,756
    with wedding invitations?

966
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,458
          [laughs] no.
 That you've never been married.

967
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:48,428
           Well, I...

968
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,997
       I was engaged once.

969
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:52,165
      Yeah, we had a party
         and everything,

970
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,267
      but we didn't end up
       going the distance.

971
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,236
      What-- what happened?

972
00:34:58,607 --> 00:35:00,273
        Uh... The, uh...

973
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,641
       The "hastings" name

974
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:04,744
and everything that's associated
      with it sometimes...

975
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,346
        It just makes me
        a bit suspicious

976
00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:08,414
  of what somebody sees in me.

977
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,484
  That's why I, uh, I left out
          a few details

978
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,953
           when we met
        in san francisco.

979
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,488
            I just...

980
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:17,824
    I kinda liked just being
     the "gallant" stranger.

981
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:22,128
      But my, uh, fiancée,
           I realized,

982
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,631
  was in love with the details,
              so...

983
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,701
       ...We never made it
   to the wedding invitations.

984
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,005
   But, uh, this one's nice...

985
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,140
       And that one, too.

986
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,042
    Mm, no, it needs to look
       like an invitation

987
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,278
        to a 19th-century
        italian wedding.

988
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:39,312
              Oh...

989
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,880
              Yeah.

990
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:41,814
              That?

991
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,183
              Yeah.

992
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:44,951
       It's... Pfft, it's
 a bit ornate, don't you think?

993
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:45,818
              What?

994
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,021
           Yeah, um...

995
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,222
     Oh! How about this one?

996
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,057
  -Look at this. Look at that.
             -Oh...

997
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:53,393
    Hmm? Traditional. Subtle.

998
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:55,128
      Yeah. No, that looks
       like the invitation

999
00:35:55,163 --> 00:35:56,896
to a 19th-century board meeting.

1000
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,064
     It has to be romantic!

1001
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,866
      This is our wedding--

1002
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,167
          [words catch]

1003
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:02,402
           ...G-gala.

1004
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,537
           [stammers]
          the museum's.

1005
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:07,974
 Um, it just needs to, you know,
 it needs to feel very romantic.

1006
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:10,643
      You... You disagree?

1007
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,645
      No, it's just, uh...

1008
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:14,480
         Think you seem
        a bit flustered.

1009
00:36:14,516 --> 00:36:16,182
     No, I'm not flustered.

1010
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,151
      I'm just-- this is me
       making a decision.

1011
00:36:18,186 --> 00:36:19,485
         Okay, now-- no.

1012
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:22,855
             No, no.

1013
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:23,923
               No.

1014
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:24,824
           No, no, no.

1015
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:27,493
               Oh.

1016
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:29,095
         This is pretty.

1017
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:30,530
  Yeah. This is really pretty.

1018
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,566
     Yeah, it's very pretty.

1019
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:36,035
           Very warm.

1020
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,039
         For the gala--
         it looks, um...

1021
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,841
        That looks good.

1022
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:44,277
   It's a beautiful invitation
          for the gala.

1023
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,912
          It's-it's...

1024
00:36:45,947 --> 00:36:47,747
   It's a nice... Invitation.

1025
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:51,184
      I'm glad you like it.

1026
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,190
  So you think this is the one?

1027
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:59,425
           Yeah, I do.

1028
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:02,061
              [♪♪♪]

1029
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,296
           [chuckles]

1030
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:04,631
   yeah, I guess you could say

1031
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,566
   I've always loved anything
       that looks vintage.

1032
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,067
        How long have you
   and your friends been doing

1033
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,303
 these, uh, antiquing weekends?

1034
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,438
       Since grad school.
      That's where we met.

1035
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:13,740
         Wow, so, what,
          you're like--

1036
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,608
  you're, like, kindred spirits
          or something?

1037
00:37:15,644 --> 00:37:17,543
    Yeah. I mean, yes and no,
             though.

1038
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,312
        We're actually--
    we're all very different.

1039
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:21,247
   We all see art differently.

1040
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,782
         Tracy sells it
      at an auction house--

1041
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:24,384
      defining its value--

1042
00:37:24,419 --> 00:37:26,586
        and then emma...

1043
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,922
    Well, she analyzes art--
 its history, how it's evolved.

1044
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,224
         How about you?

1045
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,326
            I just...
   I just like to look at it,

1046
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:34,394
     so I work in a museum.

1047
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:36,429
           [chuckles]

1048
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,298
        and we see, yeah,
     we see art differently,

1049
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,299
       but not friendship.

1050
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,134
       Those girls are...

1051
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:43,903
  Oh, they're my ride-or-dies,
  and that's-- that's forever.

1052
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:46,506
     So which one's gonna be
       your maid of honor?

1053
00:37:46,574 --> 00:37:48,941
     Well, trios are tricky,
        so we made a pact

1054
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,677
     and promised each other

1055
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:52,011
          to each have
      two maids of honors.

1056
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,613
              Wow.

1057
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:56,249
I was my friend drew's best man.

1058
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:58,184
  But he didn't have a choice,
     you know, I'm his boss,

1059
00:37:58,253 --> 00:37:59,852
       and he doesn't have
       any other friends.

1060
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:01,421
            [laughs]

1061
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,791
      hey, wait a second--

1062
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,759
  isn't that the place you were
 talking about in san francisco?

1063
00:38:06,795 --> 00:38:08,194
              Yeah.

1064
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:10,096
   What? You-- you want to go?

1065
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,332
           [avery] mm!

1066
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,667
      Okay, the mexican mac
         is my favorite.

1067
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:17,603
  Yeah? Try the mac and bacon.

1068
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:22,375
     Okay, that is<i> so good.</i>

1069
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,010
        -Right? So good.
      -That's unbelievable.

1070
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,678
            You know,
   I used to come here a lot,

1071
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:27,213
     then I ran out of time,

1072
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:28,715
      because it turns out
     that giving away money

1073
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:31,117
     is a full-time job, so.

1074
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:32,852
    You're not what I thought
     a "hastings" would be.

1075
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:36,356
    I mean, we're not exactly
          blue bloods.

1076
00:38:36,391 --> 00:38:38,825
            My father
     was a biotech engineer

1077
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
      and when his company
       became successful,

1078
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:43,062
  that's when he and my mother
     started the foundation.

1079
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:46,466
   Yeah, he always believed in
  giving back to the community,

1080
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,533
        funding research.

1081
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:48,668
    And then it was my mother

1082
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,470
             who had
  this strong family commitment

1083
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:53,206
  and the importance of legacy.

1084
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,974
         It sounds like
     they were a great team.

1085
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:57,143
        Yeah, they were.

1086
00:38:57,178 --> 00:39:01,981
       And then, uh, well,
 two years ago, my father died.

1087
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:04,083
     That's when I took over
         the foundation.

1088
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,920
  It must be really gratifying

1089
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,757
    to carry on the good work
        that he started.

1090
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:12,358
      That's the best part
           of the job.

1091
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,427
            In fact,

1092
00:39:14,496 --> 00:39:15,862
           on Friday,
     we are breaking ground

1093
00:39:15,897 --> 00:39:17,363
 on a new hospital for children.

1094
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,232
         That's amazing.

1095
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,668
          I don't know.
          It's like...

1096
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:24,237
 This whole suit-and-tie thing,

1097
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:28,174
           it's just--
       it's not who I am.

1098
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:31,043
   I guess I just-- I'm afraid
     of letting people down.

1099
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:34,547
     What does the real you
           want to do?

1100
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,850
  Well, when I figure that out,

1104
00:39:49,197 --> 00:39:50,530
      was a turning point.

1105
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:52,298
            You know?
   Like a sign, or something.

00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,433

  you picked out some indie guy

       talk you out of it.

      those are your ideas,

        see 'em through.

     it was very productive.

 I've rearranged my priorities,

00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:42,608

      are front and center.

        I don't have time

1156
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:47,346

00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:52,485
       Things have gotten
     very awkward between us

1160
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,920
  and we have to work together.

1161
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:55,421
             Oh, no.
      Did something happen?

 he ran cold for the last time.

     You don't seem over it.

1165
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,529
        Well, it's okay.
         You know what?

1166
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,965
   Maybe he's not comfortable
         getting close,

1167
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,266
        or maybe he's not
      that attracted to me.

00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:08,534
          I don't know.

1169
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,469
  Or he's very attracted to you

1170
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:13,606
      and he's pulling back
      because he's afraid.

1171
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:15,641

      that still leaves us

1263
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:03,836
       fund art programs?

1264

      with art, too, right?

1268
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:17,516
      Yeah, but, you know,
     my mother just believes

1269
00:46:17,552 --> 00:46:20,085
     it's important to honor
       my father's legacy,

1270
00:46:20,121 --> 00:46:21,287

00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,155

1306
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,472
      Well, it needs to be
     treated in a vapor tent

1308

     won't be here in time.

1644
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:40,038
   Oh. Well, I mean, that's--
     that's not your fault.

1645
01:01:41,341 --> 01:01:43,074
           Kind of is.

1646
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,610
 I was floating so many projects
  trying to get the promotion,

1647
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,345
    I accidentally booked him
      on the wrong flight.

1648
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,847
       Now it's too late.

1649
01:01:48,882 --> 01:01:50,615
        Oh. I'm so sorry.

1650
01:01:50,684 --> 01:01:52,450
        Is there anything
        I can do to help?

1651
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:54,052
      Well, there's nothing
         anyone can do.

1652
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:56,087
 I've got a group of school kids
   coming here in a few hours,

1653
01:01:56,123 --> 01:01:58,356
  and I have to cancel on them.

1654
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:03,762
       I really don't want
       to make this call.

1655
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:07,899
              [♪♪♪]

1656
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:10,635
         I have an idea
 that might solve your problem.

1657
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,772
   Okay, okay. You know what,

1658
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,306
  I said I was gonna step up...

1659
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:17,375
      So I'm gonna step up.

1660
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,644
     But am-am-am I the most
   qualified person for this?

1661
01:02:19,713 --> 01:02:20,779
              Yes.

1662
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:21,946
        Because I don't--
      I don't feel like it.

1663
01:02:21,982 --> 01:02:24,115
         Well, you have
    a passion for art, okay?

1664
01:02:24,151 --> 01:02:26,317
   You have a generous desire
     to share it with kids,

1665
01:02:26,386 --> 01:02:28,486
      and how much more of
  a qualification do you need?

1666
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:30,588
      Hey, just think about
         that little boy

1667
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:32,457
       who was so inspired
   by those western paintings

1668
01:02:32,492 --> 01:02:33,758
         that he wanted
         to be a cowboy.

1669
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:37,729
       [uncertainly] okay.

1670
01:02:37,764 --> 01:02:38,997
              Okay.

1671
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:40,799
    How long is this, though?

1672
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:42,233
          Is it a lon--
       is it a long thing?

1673
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:43,601
          It's an hour.

1674
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:45,303
      And this is something
   you've always wanted to do,

1675
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:46,905
       now you get to see
       if it's a good fit.

1676
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,907
  Wh-- what happens if there's,
like, the next picasso out there

1677
01:02:48,942 --> 01:02:50,275
         and I send him
          to dentistry?

1678
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:54,312
          You got this.

1679
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:55,980
        You got this! Go.

1680
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:00,084
              Okay.

1681
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,152
            [exhales]

1682
01:03:01,188 --> 01:03:02,687
           I got this.
     I got this. I got this.

1683
01:03:02,756 --> 01:03:05,123
     I got this. I got this.
     I got this. I got this.

1684
01:03:08,028 --> 01:03:11,162
              So...
  I don't know about you guys,

1685
01:03:11,198 --> 01:03:12,530
         but when I look
        at this sculpture

1686
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:14,499
      and I tilt my head...

1687
01:03:16,136 --> 01:03:17,969
     ...It kinda looks like
        "my little pony"

1688
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:20,104
       made out of legos.

1689
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,673
               No?

1690
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:23,541
     You guys don't see it?

1691
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:24,509
      What do you guys see?

1692
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:27,545
     It looks like the time

1693
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:28,847
     when my little brother

1694
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:30,348
        left his crayons
       outside in the sun

1695
01:03:30,383 --> 01:03:32,984
    and they melted together.

1696
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:34,118
  [laughs] it melted together?

1697
01:03:34,154 --> 01:03:35,687
         You know what?

1698
01:03:35,722 --> 01:03:37,989
         I can see that.

1699
01:03:38,024 --> 01:03:40,325
   And, actually, that is why
  we call this "abstract art".

1700
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,528
     Because everybody sees
      something different,

1701
01:03:43,563 --> 01:03:45,997
    and it gives us something
 to talk about and think about.

1702
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:49,300
      Do you guys wanna see
         some more art?

1703
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:50,468
          -[kids] yeah!
        -Yeah? All right!

1704
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,375
      Having peter fill in
      was a wonderful idea.

1705
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,511
      I had no idea he'd be
   so engaging with the kids.

1706
01:04:01,748 --> 01:04:03,314
      It was avery's idea.

1707
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,383
          She deserves
      the credit for this.

1708
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:07,886
   I appreciate your honesty.

1709
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:12,323
             [sonya]
 it's still your program, jason.

1710
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,193
             I think
   you should see it through.

1711
01:04:16,529 --> 01:04:18,997
 You should enlist peter's help.

1712
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:20,765
           Thank you.

1713
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:22,200
           Of course.
  I'm just glad it worked out.

1714
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:27,272
        There's something
       I need to tell you.

1715
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,573
           I'm the one
      who took the message

1716
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:29,707
     from frederick neumann.

1717
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:33,011
             I know.

1718
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:34,946
       Frederick told me.

1719
01:04:35,015 --> 01:04:36,347
      Okay, I don't get it.

1720
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,749
 Why did you bail me out today?

1721
01:04:37,784 --> 01:04:39,183
         Because I care
        about the museum,

1722
01:04:39,219 --> 01:04:40,218
        and you do, too.

1723
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:42,086
        It's a win-win...

1724
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:43,855
       Especially for him.

1725
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:48,927
      You think competitors
         can be friends?

1726
01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:50,962
         Apparently so.

1729
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,042

1731
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:08,446
   okay if we crate it up now?

       to tell you later,

1739
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:49,587
       you look stunning.

1740

      how dashing you look?

   oh, congratulations, peter.

01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:05,169

     the most exciting event

1747
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:06,237
       that the stanbridge
          has ever had.

          Thanks, mom.

1749
01:06:07,674 --> 01:06:09,407
   Ah, well, you know, I can't
    take full credit, though.

    an extraordinary evening.

 anyone's gonna be disappointed.

        have a good time,

1773
01:06:58,224 --> 01:07:01,626
    and to unveil a painting

1774
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:03,227
       which has not been
         publicly viewed

1775
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:04,462
          in 56 years.

1776
01:07:05,899 --> 01:07:07,231
    Some of you may be aware

1777
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:10,134
       of the 19th-century
      artist claudio amici,

1778
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,702
but for those of you who aren't,

1779
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:13,404
             I think
    you'll find this painting

1780
01:07:13,473 --> 01:07:15,473
       to be a revelation.

1781
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,243
       It is my privilege

1782
01:07:19,312 --> 01:07:21,012

    just incredibly helpful,

1792
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:43,267
     especially when it came
  to researching the painting.

1793
01:07:43,336 --> 01:07:45,570
     Well, he's always been
      very taken with art,

1794
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,438
           ever since
       he was a young boy.

1795
01:07:47,507 --> 01:07:49,173
        He told me about
     the remington paintings

1796
01:07:49,209 --> 01:07:50,541
      and how they made him
      want to be a cowboy.

1797
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:51,776
            [laughs]

1798
01:07:51,845 --> 01:07:53,711
       and did he tell you
      that he convinced us

1799
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:56,547
   to get him a cowboy outfit
    that he wore everywhere?

1800
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,116
     He left that part out.

1801
01:07:58,184 --> 01:07:59,517
            [laughs]

1802
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:01,853
    that's one of the things
       I admire about him,

1803
01:08:01,888 --> 01:08:04,956
      how he wants to share
      his passion for art.

1804
01:08:05,024 --> 01:08:07,191
   Well, I know that he finds
     his work at the museum

1805
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:08,626
        very gratifying.

1806
01:08:08,695 --> 01:08:10,194
   It's not just that, though.

1807
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:11,596
           He actually
      jumped in last-minute

1808
01:08:11,631 --> 01:08:13,598
   and rescued the children's
   art program the other day,

1809
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:17,468
  and the way he was explaining
    abstract art to the kids,

1810
01:08:17,537 --> 01:08:19,704
     it was just... [laughs]
         it was amazing.

1811
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,739
      I don't know if peter
    or the kids had more fun.

1812
01:08:21,774 --> 01:08:23,641
   Oh, he never mentioned it.

1813
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,042
             Really?

1814
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:28,045
    He said that teaching art
       to-to young people

1815
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:29,213
          is something
   he had always wanted to do.

1816
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:32,783
          Oh, I thought
   he'd given up that notion.

1817
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:34,919
         Did-- did I...

1818
01:08:34,954 --> 01:08:37,421
       Did I say something
        I shouldn't have?

1819
01:08:37,457 --> 01:08:39,223
         -Oh, no, dear.
  -I'm sorry, I just assumed--

1820
01:08:39,259 --> 01:08:41,425
         I think it's I
who has been making assumptions.

1821
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:43,394
           [footsteps]

1822
01:08:43,429 --> 01:08:44,629
             [lucy]
   I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1823
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:46,731
        There's a person
       from<i> the globe</i> here

1824
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:47,932
 that wants to do an interview.

1825
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:49,834
     Um, excuse me a minute.

1826
01:08:49,903 --> 01:08:51,669
           Of course.

1827
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,476
   [avery] oh, I have to take
          a look at it.

1828
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:00,745
        Yeah. Of course.

1829
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,580
       Hey. Should we grab

1830
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:04,282
         some champagne
         and celebrate?

1831
01:09:04,317 --> 01:09:06,350
       Uh, not right now.

1832
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,252
           Can I, uh,
   can I talk to you outside?

1833
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:10,988
              Sure.

1834
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,959
       Is something wrong?

1835
01:09:14,994 --> 01:09:16,994
        Yeah, I just had
 a conversation with my mother.

1836
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,462
       I really like her.

1837
01:09:18,498 --> 01:09:20,264
 Yeah, she really likes you too,

1838
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,999
      but all of a sudden,
         she's concerned

1839
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:24,168
  about some unfulfilled dream
   I have about teaching art.

1840
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:27,772
    Asking if I'm even happy
       at the foundation.

1841
01:09:27,807 --> 01:09:28,973
         Are you happy?

1842
01:09:29,008 --> 01:09:30,841
      That's not the point.

1843
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:33,811
  I'm sorry, I think I'm lost.
       What is the point?

1844
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:35,646
        My mother puts on
  a brave face in public, okay?

1845
01:09:35,682 --> 01:09:37,381
    But she's still mourning
     the loss of my father.

1846
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:40,952
     This foundation is how
      she keeps him alive.

1847
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:43,654
   It's not about what I want,

1848
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,190
  it's about my responsibility
          to my family.

1849
01:09:46,226 --> 01:09:48,059
        I meant no harm.

1850
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:49,327
    I'm so sorry I upset her.

1851
01:09:50,863 --> 01:09:53,030
     Is this just an excuse
       to pull away again?

1852
01:09:53,066 --> 01:09:54,565
         Because, peter,

1853
01:09:54,634 --> 01:09:57,201
    there's no phantom fiancé
    you can blame this time.

1854
01:10:00,907 --> 01:10:02,473
     I'm sorry. I-I just...

1855
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:04,675
        I can't do this.

1856
01:10:05,878 --> 01:10:08,379
              [♪♪♪]

1857
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:12,350
        I'm sure you guys

1858
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:13,651
    have better things to do
           on a Sunday

1859
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:14,685
        than listen to me

1860
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:15,820
    <i> whine about last night.</i>

1861
01:10:15,855 --> 01:10:17,521
        It's not whining
    when you're in the right.

1862
01:10:17,557 --> 01:10:19,423
 [avery]<i> maybe I shouldn't have</i>
  <i> said anything to his mother.</i>

1863
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:20,725
          You were just
       telling the truth.

1864
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,892
       It's not your fault

1865
01:10:21,928 --> 01:10:23,527
          if he doesn't
     want to acknowledge it.

1866
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:24,662
      All right, let's talk

1867
01:10:24,697 --> 01:10:26,063
         about something
    more reliable than love.

1868
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:27,164
           Like what?

1869
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,499
          <i> Your career.</i>

1870
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:29,900
    <i> Have you heard anything</i>
      <i> about the promotion?</i>

1871
01:10:29,936 --> 01:10:32,737
     Well, I mean, the gala
     went really well, so...

1872
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:34,672
       Hopefully... Maybe?

1873
01:10:34,707 --> 01:10:35,840
          I don't know.

1874
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,275
 <i> Can you try saying that again</i>

1875
01:10:37,343 --> 01:10:39,076
   <i> with a little more belief</i>
          <i> in yourself?</i>

1876
01:10:39,112 --> 01:10:40,378
         [scoffs] yeah.

1877
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:42,546
   I gonna need a couple days
      to refill that tank.

1878
01:10:42,582 --> 01:10:44,582
        <i> In the meantime,</i>
     <i> we'll believe in you.</i>

1879
01:10:44,617 --> 01:10:46,250
           Aw. Thanks.

1880
01:10:46,286 --> 01:10:48,185
            You guys,
      go enjoy your Sunday.

          <i> -Talk soon.</i>

1883
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:11,042
   Peter's not the one either.

1884
01:11:11,077 --> 01:11:13,377
      It's time to move on.

1885
01:11:15,114 --> 01:11:16,247
             [sighs]

1886
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:31,929
         there you are.

1887
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:35,800
       A perk of the job.

1888
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:36,901
     Did you need something?

1889
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:38,636
    I wanted to let you know

1890
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,105
    the museum administration
           has decided

1891
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,973
         to promote you
        to full curator.

1892
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:44,975
     Congratulations, avery.

1893
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:48,245
   [chuckles] you have no idea
   how much this means to me.

1894
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:49,847
       The last few weeks
        have only proven

1895
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,149
    what an invaluable asset
   you are to the stanbridge,

1896
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:54,251
    so I'd say you earned it.

1897
01:11:54,287 --> 01:11:56,821
 And I will continue to earn it.
           Thank you.

1898
01:11:56,856 --> 01:11:58,356
     Congratulations again.

1899
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:04,095
             [sighs]

1900
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:14,972
            hi, mom.

1901
01:12:15,007 --> 01:12:16,607
         Hello, darling.

1902
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:19,009
      What was so important

1903
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:21,445
         that you wanted
      to have lunch today?

1904
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:22,646
      Well, I just thought
     there were some things

1905
01:12:22,682 --> 01:12:23,881
   that we needed to clear up.

1906
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:26,784
           Like what?

1907
01:12:26,819 --> 01:12:29,653
      I've been doing a lot
   of thinking since the gala.

1908
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:32,456
    If running the foundation

1909
01:12:32,492 --> 01:12:33,891
        is not something
      you want to be doing,

1910
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,459
       then you shouldn't.

1911
01:12:35,495 --> 01:12:36,527
       I never said that.

1912
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,895
       Which is why I did.

1913
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:40,898
        All I care about
       is your happiness,

1914
01:12:40,967 --> 01:12:43,634
           and that's
    where my happiness lies.

1915
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:46,203
         The foundation
       is well-established

1916
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,173
    and your father's legacy
           is secure.

1917
01:12:51,477 --> 01:12:53,244
             I heard
      you were quite a hit

1918
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:54,812
          with the kids
       at the stanbridge.

1919
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:56,046
            [laughs]

1920
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:58,082
 avery said you were "amazing".

1921
01:12:59,352 --> 01:13:01,018
              Yeah.

1922
01:13:01,053 --> 01:13:03,988
 Well, you know, she always sees
       the best in people.

1923
01:13:04,023 --> 01:13:07,758
 Well, it took a lot of courage
       for her to speak up

1924
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:10,394
          and tell me,
        ever so sweetly,

1925
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,696
        what I might have
      missed about my son.

1926
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:17,334
      And, you know, ah...

1927
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:20,538
 I-- I pushed her away again...

1928
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:25,109
  ...And that's the last thing
       that I want to do.

1929
01:13:25,178 --> 01:13:26,110
           Then don't.

1930
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:29,213
            You know,
     when I first met avery,

1931
01:13:29,248 --> 01:13:30,948
  I didn't tell her who I was--

1932
01:13:31,017 --> 01:13:33,617
         -[grace laughs]
    -...Or what I did and...

1933
01:13:33,686 --> 01:13:35,686
          And she still
       seemed to like me.

1934
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:38,122
       All the more reason
          to trust her.

1935
01:13:38,191 --> 01:13:39,723
             And...

1936
01:13:39,759 --> 01:13:42,026
       Trust how you feel.

1937
01:13:45,097 --> 01:13:47,031
    Peter, life is so short,

01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,454
  I'm going to Italy next month
            to teach.

2089
01:21:57,489 --> 01:21:58,889
      I could take the veil

2090
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,891
        and-and research
         its provenance.

2091
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,025
              Yeah.

2092
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:03,660
       That's a good idea.

2093
01:22:03,696 --> 01:22:05,195
 And then we don't have to worry
  about who gets the veil next.

2094
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,631
     Well, only if you won't
         be needing it.

2095
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:11,702
 Finn and I are fine as we are--
       no rings, no rice.

2096
01:22:11,737 --> 01:22:13,470
    You should take the veil.

2097
01:22:13,505 --> 01:22:16,974
 Okay. Only because I'm curious
       about its history.

2098
01:22:18,544 --> 01:22:19,843
        Yeah. Definitely.

2099
01:22:19,878 --> 01:22:20,877
          For research.

2100
01:22:20,913 --> 01:22:23,080
      "it's just research."

2101
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:24,147
           [laughing]

2102
01:22:24,183 --> 01:22:26,083
              yes.

2103
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:28,418
  Well, when I first met avery,

2104
01:22:28,487 --> 01:22:30,988
     I fell in love with her
           right away,

2105
01:22:31,023 --> 01:22:34,157
   but I thought she was taken
      because of the veil.

2106
01:22:34,193 --> 01:22:36,026
     We got to follow along
          in real time.

2107
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:38,428
       Yeah, but the veil
   didn't break us up, though,

2108
01:22:38,497 --> 01:22:39,262
           it actually
      brought us together.

2109
01:22:40,733 --> 01:22:41,865
         I don't follow.

2110
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,166
              Uh...

2111
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:44,701
          You told him
    about the legend, right?

2112
01:22:44,737 --> 01:22:45,736
               No.

2113
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:47,037
          What legend?

2114
01:22:47,072 --> 01:22:50,040
    The legend is, whoever's
    in possession of the veil

2115
01:22:50,075 --> 01:22:51,408
      will find true love.

2116
01:22:51,443 --> 01:22:53,276
              [♪♪♪]

2117
01:22:53,345 --> 01:22:54,678
    well, I'll drink to that.

2118
01:22:54,713 --> 01:22:55,746
         To the veil...

2119
01:22:55,781 --> 01:22:56,713
          To the veil.

2120
01:22:56,749 --> 01:22:58,215
        And to true love.
