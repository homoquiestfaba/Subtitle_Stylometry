Morning, Otto.

Good morning.

8
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:11,995
It was a long meeting, huh?

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,370
Yeah. I don't think lunch
will ever get here.

10
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,065
You hungry?

11
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,434
Little bit.

12
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:18,703
Morning, sir.

Morning, Otto.

Good morning, Otto.

Good morning, Henry.
Turner wants to see me.

He does?

17
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:29,288
Yeah.

18
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,049
What about?

19
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,052
I'll let you know.

20
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,019
Alright.

21
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:38,893
You bet. Whatever you need to
fix the situation is great.

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,528
Hi, you wanted to see me sir?

23
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,692
Yeah. Sit.

24
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,033
Absolutely,
I'm putting one of my top guys on it.

25
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,376
Yes. Doug, could you give us
'til Wednesday on this thing?

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,877
It's starting out to
be one of those days.

27
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,782
Sit down.

28
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,518
Super. You have my personal guarantee.

29
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,814
Okay, thanks again.

30
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,893
Otto, I need your help.
And we don't have a lot of time.

31
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,286
What the hell's going on, Turner?

32
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,987
It's the proposal.

33
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,057
The initiative for Donigan Corp.
It's a mess.

34
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,970
Oh, I, I mean,
um, what, what happened to Mike?

35
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,099
I apologize. I meant to clean that up.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,501
What I need you to do, in a nutshell,

37
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,204
is rewrite the Donigan Initiative
by Tuesday.

38
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,715
Mike's version
wasn't quite up to par.

39
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,818
Wasn't up to par?

40
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,545
No.

41
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,716
So, so you killed him?

42
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,917
Oh, no, lord no.

43
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,426
That had nothing to do
with why I killed him.

44
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,490
Then, why did you do it?

45
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,500
Observe. Use reason.

46
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,128
There's a wooden stake in his heart.

47
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,673
What logical conclusion
could you draw from that, Otto?

48
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,609
Mike was a vampire.

49
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,947
Now, the intro and
the summary really aren't that bad,

50
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,076
but they definitely need to
be punched up just a little bit.

51
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,552
What makes you think
Mike was a vampire?

52
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,051
Otto, when you've been
in management as long as I have,

53
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,490
you recognize the signs.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,758
What signs?

55
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,862
You know, sleeps in a coffin,
uh, drinks blood to survive.

56
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,730
Can't go out in the sunlight,
aversion to garlic.

57
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,859
Awkwardness in social situations.

58
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,201
When did Mike start drinking blood?

59
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,537
It's hard to say.
It could be hundreds of years.

60
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,408
Have you ever seen Mike drink blood?

61
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,709
He had some on his shirt
when he came in here.

62
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
Must have dripped
while he was feasting on

63
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,513
what I can only assume
was his final victim.

64
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:41,952
Where on his shirt?

65
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,317
It's right there on the front.

66
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,952
Oh, well, I guess you got
to take my word for it.

67
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,459
Turner...

68
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,593
Hmm?
There's no such thing as vampires.

69
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,229
Then how come the only way
I could kill him

70
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,330
was to drive
that wooden stake through his heart?

71
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,170
Did you try any other ways?

72
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,343
No. How naive do you think I am?

73
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,873
He's a vampire.

74
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,139
A vampire requires
a wooden stake through the heart.

75
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,209
You wouldn't eat spaghetti
with a skateboard, would you, Otto?

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,350
What?

77
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,685
It's a simple question
to which the answer is 'no.'

78
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,782
You wouldn't eat spaghetti
with a skateboard

79
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,657
because it's the wrong tool
for the job.

80
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,593
Mike wasn't a vampire.

81
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,460
If that's true,

82
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,058
then why did he recoil in terror
when I shoved a crucifix in his face?

83
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,835
He was Jewish.

84
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,566
Otto, I would love to sit around here
and talk about religion with you,

85
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,469
but the employee handbook
strictly forbids indulging

86
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,535
in such volatile topics
of conversation in the workplace.

87
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,409
It upsets some people.

88
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,407
Now, if you'll excuse me,

89
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,752
I need to sort through
how we're going to replace Mike.

90
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,918
Damn his vampirism, today of all days.

91
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,986
Uh,
two bullet points for your to do list:

92
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,330
rewrite the Donigan initiative
by two PM on Tuesday.

93
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:04,230
Incinerate the demon Mike's unearthly
husk in roughly, uh, one hour.

94
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,454
Oh, guys?

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,926
We're screwed.

96
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,160
Jeff, you might want to clean that up.

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,004
"NETHERBEAST INCORPORATED"

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,634
I'm Otto Granberry,
and I'm 108 years old.

99
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,811
This moment began one of the darkest
chapters in Berm-Tech's long history.

100
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,903
It could have been worse,

101
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,950
like if Mike Yarrow had been
a likeable guy, for instance.

102
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,349
"44 Minutes Ago."
But he wasn't.

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,751
It makes me feel better for Turner

104
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,491
that the person
he killed seemed entirely deserving.

105
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,257
Yeah, Dow, that's just
what you need is another muffin.

106
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,795
Hey, come on, Mike.

107
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,622
Pad that ass, big boy.

108
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,526
A-hole.

109
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,095
Considering what happened next,
Turner must have thought the same.

110
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,733
I've never understood
why we've got this thing down here.

111
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,068
It seems so incredibly dangerous
in a building this old.

112
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,340
Just following FERC regulations
regarding sensitive paperwork.

113
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,785
I personally feel it's much more
thorough than a paper shredder.

114
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,685
Oh. I won't argue the point, Otto.

115
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,484
All hands meeting, ten minutes,

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,620
assemble everyone in the meadow,
if you would, please.

117
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,855
Will do.

118
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,461
Between you and me,
I'm beginning to think

119
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,526
that Mike was just a low-level operative in

120
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,595
what appears to be
a large network of the cursed

121
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,937
and undead here
at Berm-Tech Industries.

122
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,911
And I can assure you that
my actions were completely warranted

123
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,975
given the complex set of circumstances
involved, visa vi, his vampirism.

124
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,246
But rest assured, I acted
in the best interest of this company,

125
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,292
as well as your personal safety.

126
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,560
Personal safety, that's key.

127
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,764
Our Zero-Tolerance Program will be
expanded to include this issue.

128
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,964
Eating co-workers, or any nonaffiliated
personnel in accordance with the...

129
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,701
Hearing Turner toss around the term
vampire is so foreign to my ears.

130
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,436
He's hated that word for
as long as anyone's known him.

131
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,112
Yeah, Turner's one of us.

132
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,184
So this is clearly the retardations
talking, which I'll get to shortly.

133
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,954
...vampires, they win.

134
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,945
And vampires shouldn't be winners.

135
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,986
That's not to say
that Mike was a loser.

136
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,788
Maybe he didn't have a choice
in his bloodsucking peculiarities.

137
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,557
Perhaps more accurately,
Mike was an un-winner.

138
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,634
By way of illustration,
a vampire walks into a bar.

139
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,532
Okay, let's get this whole
vampire debate out of the way.

140
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,173
First of all, we're not vampires.

141
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,517
That's a whole media thing invented
by Gram Stoker to sell books.

142
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,712
We don't have fangs,
and we don't fly.

143
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,649
And yes, we have reflections.

144
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,251
Vampire makes us sound like,
well, monsters.

145
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,322
In the Middle Ages we were referred
to as 'Nether Beasts,'

146
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,388
but we prefer 'Nether Folk.'

147
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,165
We're really normal people
with a slight birth defect.

148
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,768
The heart's the thing.
It's what make us special.

149
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,308
We have an odd growth on our hearts.

150
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,237
It looks like a gristly, veiny clump.

151
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,477
This clump secretes an enzyme when
someone is faced with an unnatural death.

152
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,306
Some sort of body trauma.

153
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,453
You'll recover as long as
your heart's not destroyed.

154
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,113
And you're willing to feast.

155
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,891
Which brings up a naive notion...

156
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,688
...drinks blood to survive.

157
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,452
Oh, if it were only that easy.

158
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,064
Blood's great and all,
but blood alone won't do it.

159
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,228
No, we need human flesh as well.

160
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,136
Through various connections
we keep a steady supply of choice,

161
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,366
recently-deceased people in inventory.

162
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,444
See, we're not beasts.

163
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,407
Long gone are the days
of murder and mayhem.

164
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,039
We enjoy human flesh and blood,

165
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,376
but try not to eat
any more than we need to.

166
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,550
And in the hands of the master chef,

167
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,056
there are infinite ways
to prepare human flesh.

168
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,889
Once the body has experienced
the initial secretion, you're set.

169
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,189
No disease, and wounds heal quickly.

170
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,895
That doesn't mean
limbs will grow back,

171
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,526
or your skin will mend flawlessly.

172
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,865
It's about survival.

173
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,803
Repairing life functions.

174
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,034
Not magic.

175
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,433
In our golden age,

176
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,032
when blood flowed like wine,

177
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:15,045
and flesh flowed like,
well, much thicker wine,

178
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,873
we learned that our existence
is reliant on a rare mineral

179
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,646
we call 'Nether Stone.'

180
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,346
It's securely locked and
hidden away here at Berm-Tech,

181
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,220
and it's vital to our survival.

182
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,460
Nether Stone radiates and enriches
the enzyme in our heart.

183
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,761
As long as we're within a mile of it,

184
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,063
and continue to feast,
we can live healthy lives.

185
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,297
As healthy as you can be eating flesh,
I guess.

186
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,433
And we need to put this behind us.

187
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,670
As the representative
from Landry Ventures

188
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,441
will be arriving shortly after lunch.

189
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,212
Oops.
I spoiled my surprise, didn't I?

190
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:00,725
Well, I will say that his presence
here is a progressive step

191
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,251
towards moving Berm-Tech firmly
into the 21st Century.

192
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,831
But don't worry,
none of you will be affected directly,

193
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,496
although in fairness I should say that
all of you will be affected somewhat.

194
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,274
Once we heard that an outside visitor,
a 'first lifer' was coming,

195
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,007
we went into scramble mode.

196
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,878
Cleaning, hiding, covering up.

197
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,511
Except for an occasional
maintenance person of civic inspector,

198
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,282
we don't allow visitors.

199
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,218
The lobby is manned
by Jewel Hightower.

200
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,385
Maybe 'manned' is the wrong word.

201
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,621
There are no windows to the outside,

202
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,757
there's a small office where we meet
with our various suppliers and customers.

203
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,400
Two framed photos hang on the wall.

204
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,561
One of Alexander Graham Bell,
and his associates,

205
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,572
and one of President James Garfield.

206
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,602
The elevator to
the office floors lies

207
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,576
behind a pair of
admittedly unattractive doors.

208
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,169
Few get beyond the chartreuse doors
of Berm-Tech.

209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,772
We began as a subsidiary of the
Bell Telephone Company in Baltimore,

210
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,288
Maryland in 1886.
Alexander Graham Bell himself arranged it

211
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,414
as a favor
to President Garfield.

212
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,924
But I'll get to that later.

213
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,457
We had to move around a lot
in the early days,

214
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,122
when we'd find ourselves
on the verge of being unmasked.

215
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,823
We eventually got 'low profile'
concept down pat.

216
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,163
Since the beginning
we've manufactured telephones.

217
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,732
But in the last 20 years,
we're more into farming out the work,

218
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,706
coordinating the assembly of
telecommunications components.

219
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,137
Anyway, after lunch, Berm-Tech's
managers gathered together.

220
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,877
This group consists of
our number three guy, Henry Welby.

221
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,412
He died in 1863
as a Confederate soldier.

222
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,419
Bunyan Pritchett.

223
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,954
He was shot with
a Gatling gun forty-four times.

224
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,320
And our second in command,
Rebecca Sibley,

225
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,360
gunned down on the arm
of a gangster in 1926.

226
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,127
A productivity consultant?

227
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,064
Why on earth would
he hire one of those?

228
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,962
Why would he kill Mike?

229
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,530
I mean, we all know
it's the retardations,

230
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,575
even Dr. Berman says so.

231
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,173
Or, do you still have a problem
with that, Henry?

232
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,137
Yeah, sorry.

233
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,111
The retardations.
Not a very P.C. term, I'll admit.

234
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,741
But it's been around a while.

235
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,620
Think of it as Alzheimer's
for vampires.

236
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:11,790
Nether Folk, I'm sorry.

237
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,017
Except it's onset is much quicker,
within a few days.

238
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,492
And the memories aren't gone,
just dormant.

239
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,364
Advanced age is a factor,
but it can strike any of us.

240
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,436
Turner is 191 years old,
which is pretty old.

241
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:31,332
In most cases, once the retardation
set in, it's over.

242
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,848
But occasionally they reverse themselves
naturally, resulting in normal behavior.

243
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,407
I guess that's what we were
all hoping for with Turner.

244
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,380
Look,
no one wants to say anything about it,

245
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,446
but perhaps it's time to enjoin
Turner to the greater number.

246
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,219
No, it's too early for that, Bunyan.

247
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,889
But from a risk-management
standpoint it makes sense.

248
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,828
No, Henry's right, it's too early.

249
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,727
Let's see
if the retardations reverse.

250
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,267
Yes, remember Rafe Costello?

251
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,400
He reversed in the second week.

252
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,796
That was 25 years ago, Henry.

253
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,204
Well so what? So what?

254
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,038
You know, we, we put a couple
of guys on to shadow him,

255
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,906
and, uh, he'll be no trouble at all.

256
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,745
Okay, barring an emergency situation,
one more week. Agreed?

257
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,782
Agreed.

258
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,673
He brings 22 years of productivity
consulting experience to us,

259
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,507
and good lord, you've been
at this a while, haven't you Steven?

260
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:48,886
Hello. I know what you're
all thinking, 'he's a cost-cutter,'

261
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:53,515
which means downsizing, subsequent
layoffs and pink slips, right?

262
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,751
In the interest of full disclosure,

263
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,920
that wasn't exactly
what we were thinking.

264
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,290
This guy's got to go.

265
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,358
What the hell was Turner thinking?

266
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,061
This guy could ruin everything.

267
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,668
He looks delicious.

268
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,171
With a baked potato.

269
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,536
A few collared greens.

270
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:14,375
Don't worry. I have never once
recommended layoffs or pink slips.

271
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,405
Especially for a company that's been
in business as long as Berm-Tech.

272
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:24,514
And I'm convinced that each and
every one of you is a capable employee.

273
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,117
Capable is key.

274
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:34,960
Key.
It's about procedure not personnel.

275
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:39,266
So don't worry,
you'll hardly feel a thing.

276
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,673
And this is my go-to guy, Henry Welby.

277
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,436
And this Otto Granberry.

278
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,673
A Team-Lead under Henry.

279
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,341
It's nice to meet you,
looking forward to the work.

280
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,439
And Henry.

281
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,505
Steven.

282
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,709
I've heard a lot of things.

283
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,151
I'm hoping to rely heavily
on your expertise.

284
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,346
Well, of course.
Any, anything I can do to help.

285
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,818
We were about to take a little tour
of the facilities,

286
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,659
but Rebecca has asked that Henry
and I have a short powwow,

287
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,064
so I was hoping that Otto would
play tour guide for a little while.

288
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:09,958
Sure.

289
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,664
That sounds great, but FYI, Turner,

290
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,932
powwow could be
construed as offensive.

291
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,669
Really? That's good to know.

292
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,978
I guess that's why we pay you
the heap big wampum.

293
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:23,571
Shall we?

294
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:28,012
As luck would have it, the first
employee on our tour was Emmitt Neely.

295
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,380
Our director of security.

296
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,988
Emmitt,
I'd like you to meet Steven Landry.

297
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,951
It's nice to meet you, Emmitt.

298
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,288
Likewise, my man.

299
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,966
Hey, I like those pants.

300
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:41,692
Yeah?

301
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,466
I had a pair of those back
when they were all the rage.

302
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,102
They're back again, Steven.

303
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,167
Like a runaway train, they're back.

304
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,901
Oh,
I don't know about a runaway train.

305
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,306
Like a runaway train.

306
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,635
That's terrific.

307
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:03,812
Uh, if there's ever an emergency,
we have an on-site medical facility.

308
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,324
Would you like to meet Dr. Berman?

309
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,552
We don't have to do that today.

310
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,683
Okay. Let's...

311
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,220
It's just ten days, Henry.

312
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,826
Yeah, but it's very destructive,
and expensive.

313
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,199
You're taking
the 40 thousand foot view here, Henry.

314
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,102
You got to get granular
with this thing.

315
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,164
Money isn't the issue here.

316
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,876
We never had to
worry much about money.

317
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,845
Hell, we bought into AT&T
at four cents a share.

318
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,581
But we've never needed
that to prop up the bottom line. Never.

319
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,385
As Turner likes to say,
'we're a well-oiled machine.'

320
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,151
You always say
we're a well-oiled machine.

321
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,919
Yeah, well it's been brought
to my attention

322
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,484
that we're getting
a little squeaky around here lately.

323
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,391
Who said that?

324
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,657
It's not important.

325
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,528
Just let him finish, Rebecca.

326
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:53,536
Ten days. Look, this is going to work,
or my name isn't...

327
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,513
Then we stopped in to see Bunyan.

328
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:11,113
Wow. Now that's a conversation piece.

329
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,082
That's my dog, Jeeves.

330
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:16,793
I won a sweepstakes, got a gift
certificate to a taxidermy shop.

331
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,423
It was my first time.

332
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:24,627
How long were you with Jeeves before
you had him mounted for posterity?

333
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,662
Oh, only a couple of days. I bought
him especially for the occasion.

334
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:30,805
Fantastic.

335
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,213
For the first time in decades I was
seeing my co-workers through fresh eyes.

336
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,782
Which, evidently,
isn't the best way to see them.

337
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,750
You have a wonderful evening, Jewel.

338
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,499
The consultant has left the building.

339
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,861
I repeat,
the consultant has left the building.

340
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,371
Now, at the risk of trampling
on vampire mythology once again...

341
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,607
You know, sleeps in a coffin?

342
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,338
We don't sleep in coffins.

343
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,778
In fact we sleep
in quite comfortable beds,

344
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,543
with fresh sheets every week.

345
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,249
Ugly sheets, but fresh.

346
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,877
The carpet is
a lovely blueberry vomit weave.

347
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,416
The lamps are hideous.

348
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,890
And the curtains look like they date
back to the Roosevelt Administration.

349
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,729
Not the new Roosevelt, either.

350
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,428
We live in the top five floors
of Berm-Tech.

351
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,667
We have 70 rooms,
and only 61 employees.

352
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,731
That gives us some freedom.

353
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,098
The enzyme renders us sterile
and infertile,

354
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,601
it's like shooting blanks
at moving targets.

355
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,145
We also have
an imperviousness to disease.

356
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,571
So we can be a randy lot.

357
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,440
So, no, we don't sleep in coffins.
There you go.

358
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,194
Is somebody there?

359
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:07,997
Is that you, Waxy?

360
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,474
With some of
your late night pornography?

361
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,441
Telly's all yours, old man.

362
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,942
But you better be wearing pants.

363
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,594
Most people think of Thanksgiving
as the start of the holiday season,

364
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,027
but we Nether Folk start a week
or two earlier,

365
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,989
on James Garfield's birthday.

366
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,403
That guy eating with us is my pal,
Dan Paraffin.

367
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,629
Everyone's always known him
as Waxy Dan.

368
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,837
Well, actually nobody's always
been known as anything around here.

369
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,536
Early on we thought our suppliers
might get suspicious

370
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,344
if we hung onto our first life names
for too long.

371
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,743
So every ten years or so,
we change them.

372
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,082
This is Bunyan Pritchett speaking.

373
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,086
This is Winthrop Zimmerman.

374
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,053
This is Calver Weems.

375
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,317
Nestor Pomerantz.

376
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,153
Riley Drubb speaking.

377
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:07,461
But in 1976, ABC television broadcast
a show which profoundly moved us all.

378
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,463
Alex Haley's 'Roots.'

379
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,634
Inspiration overcame us,

380
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,799
and we agreed to honor our ancestors
by returning to our original names.

381
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,537
This is Bunyan Pritchett speaking.

382
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,575
And you tried the first?
Nonsense.

383
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,308
Happy Garfield, everyone.

384
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,978
Happy Garfield

385
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,780
And Henry,
Turner would like to see us.

386
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,551
Rebecca, Henry.
Like you to meet Pearl Stricklett.

387
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,251
You're with Landry Ventures?

388
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,192
No, lord no.
She's Mike's replacement.

389
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,191
She, she's what?

390
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,196
Mike's replacement.
You know, dead Mike.

391
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,756
Oh, it was a heart attack?

392
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,425
Stake.

393
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,401
Stake?

394
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:44,958
Stake.

395
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,801
Steak. Red meat. Stuff will kill you.

396
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,400
I thought we were going to
promote from, uh, within, Turner.

397
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,908
You didn't get the memo?

398
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:52,771
No.

399
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,780
I guess I'll have to write one, then.

400
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,716
You see, we need fresh blood,
fresh approaches. New ideas.

401
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,984
You got some pretty big shoes to fill,
there, Pearl.

402
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,546
Mike Yarrow did some quality work
for us, but he's dead.

403
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,553
So I guess
that lowers the bar somewhat.

404
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,194
You can't expect much
from a dead guy.

405
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,932
You know, there's no need to panic.

406
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,535
I mean, company policy gives her
two weeks probation,

407
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,136
after that we can find some way
to get rid of her.

408
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,673
This week's not going well, Henry.

409
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,413
Turner's slipping fast.

410
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,187
Is it,
is it time to consider the Rinse?

411
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,756
Dr. Berman devised
the Remedial Rinse about 30 years ago.

412
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,825
It's a crude technique whereby

413
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,492
enzymatic fluid is flushed through
the victim's cerebral cortex.

414
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,629
It stimulates those portions
of the brain

415
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,695
that retardation's rendered lost
or unresponsive.

416
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,735
The method works well, however
it carries with it a huge risk.

417
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,041
The victim's brain
will likely die completely,

418
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,282
so the Remedial Rinse brings
fleeting clarity,

419
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,217
and nine times out of ten,
certain death.

420
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,382
We use it only if we have to.

421
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,657
Morning Otto, are we winning?

422
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:16,888
Excuse me?

423
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,986
I said, are we winning?

424
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,656
Uh, yeah,
we're hitting it and getting it.

425
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,396
Aces. Pearl Stricklett,
I'd like you to meet Otto Granberry.

426
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,938
He's going to put you through
the systems 'til you get up to speed.

427
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,701
You can use her, right?

428
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,675
Oh, yeah, I'll use her.

429
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,041
Her skills, her business skills.

430
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:37,409
Hi.

431
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,314
It's nice to meet you, Pearl.

432
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,477
Mr. Claymore.

433
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,688
Um, Turner says
you're quite the systems guru.

434
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:48,685
Oh, I don't,
I don't know about a guru.

435
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,194
No, come on, Otto. You're a guru.

436
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,555
I just hope
you'll be patient with me.

437
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,361
He's a guru. Patience.

438
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,629
I've got all the time in the world.

439
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,468
So what's the occasion?

440
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,534
It's Garfield's birthday.

441
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,002
Oh. Who's Garfield?

442
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,635
Him.

443
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,748
President Garfield? Seriously?

444
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,912
The primary reason that Berm-Tech
exists is due to James Garfield.

445
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,414
A man named Charles Guiteau
discovered Garfield was one of us

446
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,393
and tried to blackmail him.

447
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:26,330
When Garfield refused, Guiteau decided
to expose him in a very obvious way.

448
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,023
He shot him.

449
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,963
Alexander Graham Bell DR.

450
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,528
Mr. Bell, I'm Dr. Berman.

451
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,566
The President thanks you.

452
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,733
Well he can thank me
himself once I've saved his life.

453
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,710
But Bell was not brought in
to save the President,

454
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,417
as Garfield would have,
obviously, survived.

455
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,285
All Bell needed to do was locate
the bullet with his newest invention,

456
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,477
the metal detector.

457
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,649
But for all his talent,
and arrogance, Bell,

458
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,059
the greatest mechanical mind
of the century,

459
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,193
couldn't find the bullet.

460
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,325
This was due to another new invention,
the metal box spring.

461
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,334
This was of little consolation
to Bell.

462
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,130
His failure only underscored the fact

463
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,539
that there was something wholly
unnatural about the President.

464
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,179
I see the surgeons watching me, Myron.

465
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,249
They know, don't they?

466
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,642
Your wounds are healing too quickly.

467
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,414
There are too
many unanswered questions being asked.

468
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:29,820
I'm sorry, my friend, they will not
have a monster as Commander-in-Chief.

469
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,326
Perhaps it is time to enjoin you into
that greater number.

470
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:41,261
I would ask that you permit time to
try to bring the good from our anomaly.

471
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,970
After the sacrifice
President Garfield made,

472
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,034
Bell and Dr. Berman knew they needed
to create a safe haven for us.

473
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,242
Thus, Berm-Tech industries was born.

474
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:56,820
Berm-Tech has been around
for a very long time,

475
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,547
so you must be doing something right.

476
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,293
I think it's because
of your patience.

477
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,131
As the saying goes,
'slow and steady wins the race.'

478
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,567
Yes, Cecil?

479
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,367
I'm Amos, that's Cecil.

480
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:22,579
It's, um, I'm not sure, uh, I've
ever truly understood that statement,

481
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,547
uh, 'slow and steady wins the race.'

482
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,174
I mean, patience is a virtue,

483
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,113
uh, yes, but I, I don't think it...

484
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,585
It's from
'The Tortoise and the Hare,' Amos.

485
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,621
I know what it's from, Cecil,

486
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,213
I didn't just fall off
the turnip truck.

487
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,316
The thing is, that particular story is
a lousy illustration of Steven's point.

488
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,759
No, it's the whole point of
the damn story, Amos.

489
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,321
Feel free to jump in here, Steven,
if I'm talking out of my hat.

490
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,526
Listen, in a nutshell, Amos,

491
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,765
the slow tortoise,
an underdog if ever there was one,

492
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,033
ends up beating the rabbit
to the finish line

493
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,008
because he was slow and steady.

494
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,444
No, he beat the rabbit because
the rabbit was teasing the tortoise.

495
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,812
And, and, and taking naps and
showing off to all the other animals,

496
00:26:58,883 --> 00:26:59,815
and carrying on and the like.

497
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,444
It had virtually nothing to do
with the pace of the tortoise.

498
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,354
The tortoise won because the,
the rabbit was an asshole.

499
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,989
You don't even know that rabbit.

500
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,994
People, please, let's not turn this
into a blame-storming session.

501
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,402
Maybe I should, um,
give more thought to my analogies.

502
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,136
Nonsense, your analogy
was charming and bittersweet.

503
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,778
I think what Steven's trying
to convey with his analogy

504
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,714
is that even though there were
any number of contributing factors

505
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,217
which lead to the tortoise
being named the victor,

506
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,310
poor sportsmanship
and narcolepsy among them,

507
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:40,882
the fact remains that the turtle
methodically continued his progress

508
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,291
until he reached his goal.

509
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,897
Even though the rabbit
clearly should have won.

510
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,333
Much faster than a tortoise.

511
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,403
Or the, or the tortoise
in this thing, anyway.

512
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,667
Yes.

513
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,973
Wow, I can't get over
how elaborate this place is.

514
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,607
It's like a real restaurant.

515
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,919
Yeah. Well the, uh, hourly employees
have a really strong union.

516
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,916
Ah, the new employee. Welcome.

517
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,852
Would you like the special?
Uh, pot pie today.

518
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,465
Oh, pot pie. Yeah. Uh, what's in it?

519
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,795
Nothing but good stuff,
I promise you that.

520
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:27,927
"No Human Flesh."

521
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:31,066
I'll take your word for it.
Thank you.

522
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:33,736
You're welcome.

523
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,609
Can I get you a salad?

524
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:43,249
Yes, please. Uh, what kind of
salad dressing do you have?

525
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,791
Pretty much anything.
Got about a dozen different kinds.

526
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,158
Oh, wow, okay.
Um, how about creamy garlic?

527
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,289
Yeah, see garlic is a tricky thing.

528
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,760
Aversion to garlic.

529
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,531
Okay, there's some truth to that one.

530
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,565
Not all types of garlic,
but some of the hardneck varieties,

531
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,975
like Rocambole and Chesnok Red
are extremely toxic to Nether Folk.

532
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,645
Franklin Abercrombie found
that out the hard way

533
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,708
when he snuck in a plate of
shrimp scampi back in 1958.

534
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,589
Hi, mind if we sit here?

535
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,223
Sure.

536
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,724
I hope we didn't interrupt anything.

537
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,235
Not at all. We're just discussing
Dow's bad habits.

538
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,134
Not exactly good meal time talk.

539
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,543
I have a strong stomach,
so don't let me interrupt.

540
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,477
We've already covered
the real vile ones.

541
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,672
Uh, nose picking, throat snorting.

542
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,907
Testicle scratching.

543
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,017
Okay,
maybe we should sit somewhere else.

544
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,041
Back me up here, Pearl.

545
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,450
These men, it's always scratch,
scratch, scratch. Am I right?

546
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,581
No, Jewel, you're not right.

547
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,186
It's never scratch, scratch, scratch.
That's a myth.

548
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,518
Oh, please, Dow.
And I suppose men don't scratch?

549
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,597
No, technically we do not.

550
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,224
Not down in the testicular region.

551
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,199
Jeff's right.

552
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,165
From an engineering standpoint,
the scrotum is a complete disaster.

553
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,274
See, the Good Lord designed
the scrotum in such a way

554
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,708
to make it inefficient
to simply scratch away at it.

555
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,474
It's like,
uh, chopping wood on a waterbed.

556
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,279
It lacks stability and rigidity.

557
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,188
So there are two preferred methods
that can be employed to scratch,

558
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:26,985
if you will, your nether regions.

559
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,923
I'm more of a pinch and roll man,
myself.

560
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,758
Yeah,
and I prefer the stretch and flick.

561
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,193
The stretch and flick.

562
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,868
I, uh,
saw Emmitt in the lounge last night.

563
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,198
That must have been shortly
after we checked his room.

564
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,940
He took a bunch of stuff with him.
Mostly clothes.

565
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,842
Why would he absquatulate?

566
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,739
Maybe he found another source
of Nether Stone.

567
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,541
Did he seem moody?

568
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,851
Not at all.

569
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,851
In fact, he and Judd Plimmer
were laughing and making merry

570
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:04,088
and having some sort of contest
that involved, well, pooting.

571
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,857
See? What, what did I tell you
about those sloppy Joes? Hmm?

572
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:10,631
Okay, I'm off.

573
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,334
Thanks a lot for all your help today.

574
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,464
I know this can be
really overwhelming.

575
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,440
No, it's the best way to learn,
falling into it.

576
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,911
So, it seems like a fun group.

577
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,918
And with the Garfield cake
and the testicular engineering.

578
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,214
Don't worry,
it's not always like that.

579
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,052
Damn, I was hoping it was.

580
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,224
Um, so are, are you leaving soon,
Otto?

581
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,394
Yeah. In a little bit, yeah.

582
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,097
Do you guys ever do happy hour?

583
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,498
I thought maybe we could grab a drink.

584
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:52,932
Or some coffee.

585
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,672
Uh, I...

586
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,646
I mean, unless you have a,
a wife to get home to.

587
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:01,244
Or you have something else to do,
or something.

588
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:07,023
I, I don't have a wife,
but I have a dog.

589
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:08,621
Oh, you have a dog?

590
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:09,387
Yeah.

591
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,219
What's his name?

592
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,660
His name? His, his name is Jeeves.

593
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,498
Jeeves?

594
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,329
Yeah.

595
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,797
That's cute.

596
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,496
Yeah.

597
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,400
Maybe another time?

598
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,343
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

599
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,371
Maybe another time?

600
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,375
What other time you talkin' about?

601
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,143
When are you ever going out
for a drink?

602
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,578
I don't know.
Maybe if it was later in the evening?

603
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,750
Like Monday night?

604
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,386
Wait a second.
I know what you're talking about,

605
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,622
you're talking about misusing
Purveyance Night, aren't you?

606
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,022
Maybe.

607
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,196
Purveyance Night is our sole
opportunity to get out of the building,

608
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,930
to do some personal shopping
or what have you.

609
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,397
Each employee's rotation comes up
every seven weeks or so.

610
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,376
Which leads into the question of...

611
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,911
Can't go out in the sunlight.

612
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,677
Not entirely true.

613
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,209
Yes, it's harmful,

614
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,750
but not quite to the degree
the movies would have you believe.

615
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,186
In the early days
we'd go out periodically,

616
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,314
but it was easier to protect your
skin back when hats were in vogue.

617
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,485
We did a lot of damage
to our bones in those days.

618
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:22,433
We didn't realize how much until Amos
Crenshaw's 120th birthday party in 1950.

619
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,067
After that, Turner kept Berm-Tech
locked up tighter than Dick's hat band.

620
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,169
But this only succeeded in
pissing everyone off to the point

621
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:31,674
where we felt like prisoners.

622
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,613
All of this culminated in the
Great Worker Rebellion of 1981,

623
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,843
documented in this black
velvet painting.

624
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,249
That's when Turner proposed the current
Purveyance Night rotational system.

625
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,748
You're not scheduled
for Monday night.

626
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,284
No?

627
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,787
You going to just let me shoot it?

628
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,118
But you are.

629
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,655
Come on, Otto,
I don't want to switch.

630
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,025
Ask Elton or Monroe.

631
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,030
Sweeten the pot,
I bet you Monroe will do it.

632
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,041
It's true. He likes good wine.

633
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,336
He does. He does.

634
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,345
He loves the wine.

635
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:14,778
You know what I love?
I love slam-dunking in your face!

636
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:25,259
Well, I'm not doing this for me, Waxy.
I'm doing this for Berm-Tech.

637
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:30,400
That's ludicrous. How is bringing her
out for a drink going to help Berm-Tech?

638
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,766
Well, she'll leave here thinking
this is a normal company,

639
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,568
the kind where the employees
occasionally leave the building.

640
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,502
What could be more normal
than going out for happy hour?

641
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:44,480
Oh, uh, that makes total sense.
You're so smart.

642
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,548
Just tell her you have family commitments,
and be as vague as you like.

643
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,610
She ain't gonna pry.

644
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,116
It's kind of hard to break up with
someone you're not even dating, Waxy.

645
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:55,825
And when you tell her,

646
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,987
look her right in the eye and
give her the Eye of the Jackal.

647
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,597
The Eye of the Jackal?
What the hell is that?

648
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:08,603
Listen, Otto, the Eye of the Jackal.
It's the only way.

649
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,601
Yeah, but what am I supposed to...

650
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,644
The Eye of the Jackal, sir.

651
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,312
Look at that.

652
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,676
Have you seen
how big my shoulders are getting?

653
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,896
Kitchen's closed.

654
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,704
You know the rules.

655
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,641
So, yeah, then you just do
the same thing for the next...

656
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,845
Monday started very well,

657
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,044
in spite of the fact
that it was Monday.

658
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,017
I'd popped the big happy hour
question at around eight-fifteen.

659
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,686
And of course,
the answer was affirmative.

660
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,426
I felt pretty good about that.

661
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,064
Hey, listen, Granberry,

662
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,123
I was wondering, uh, if maybe you
and I could get together,

663
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,600
have a little intercourse
before lunch?

664
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,861
Possible?
Any time before eleven-thirty.

665
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,405
Hi.

666
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,335
I hid from Steven for
the rest of the day.

667
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,575
Myrtie Vanhoover?

668
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,014
Yep. She's never been late.

669
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,114
I checked her room
and a lot of her stuff is gone.

670
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,283
Did she seem unhappy at all?

671
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:36,356
The whole kitchen staff has been unhappy
since that first lifer, Pearl, was hired.

672
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:36,984
But Monroe, you...

673
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,392
But, but, but, but.

674
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:42,756
Some of my crew
have been waiting 15, 20 years

675
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,596
for their white collar rotation.

676
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,470
Same thing happened
with Mike Yarrow last year

677
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,200
when he got preferential treatment.

678
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,136
Yeah,
but you saw what happened to him.

679
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,580
Yeah, but, uh, perhaps my kitchen staff
is capable of writing an initiative

680
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,843
that won't result in death.

681
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,852
Duly noted?

682
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,678
Uh, duly noted. Duly noted.

683
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:15,498
Now, do, do we know
if Emmitt and Myrtie were,

684
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,656
you know...

685
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:21,965
I don't think so.

686
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,240
We need to consider

687
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,037
that another source of Nether Stone
has been found in the city.

688
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:30,041
Well we also need to consider
company-wide bonuses as well.

689
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,416
It's been nice working with you.

690
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:54,264
Is something wrong with this door,
or something?

691
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,397
Is there something wrong with it,
June?

692
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,965
It's Jewel, sir,
and the door's fine, Mr. Claymore.

693
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,978
If there's nothing wrong with this
door, then why can't I get it open?

694
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,411
Has it been repurposed or something?

695
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,415
Is that what's been
going on around here?

696
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,077
Because I can understand a modicum
of monkey business in the workplace

697
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,416
to sort of boost morale,
but really you...

698
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,115
I'm not sure
where he thought home was,

699
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,214
but he was determined to get there.

700
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,730
Sure, I can keep him sedated 24 hours
a day if that's what you want.

701
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,168
But the retardations can't reverse
themselves under those conditions.

702
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,933
In that case, we might
as well do the Remedial Rinse.

703
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,078
I tell you, everything would be
a whole lot easier with the Rinse.

704
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,176
We can't lose sight at
what's at stake, Henry.

705
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,578
What would Turner do
if you two switched places?

706
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,619
What if we were just
to sedate him at night? After work.

707
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,817
Okay, here's the deal,
mark his calendar with meetings,

708
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,123
have two guys shadow him at all times.

709
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,754
But the moment the workday ends,
we're knocking him out.

710
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,058
It's eight-fifty now.

711
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,068
Alright, ladies, we have three hours,
let's make the most of it.

712
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,131
So Waxy, Jewel,
Elton and I left for Purveyance Night.

713
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:05,800
Let's go.

714
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,003
Oh, I guess I should explain
the whole Elton thing.

715
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:12,513
See, back in 1976
when we were all watching 'Roots,'

716
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,953
Walter Shackleford was in another room
watching an episode of Merv Griffin...

717
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,616
...featuring, well, Elton John.

718
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,650
And he hasn't spoken since.

719
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,393
She seems very sweet, Otto,

720
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,527
but I don't know
how to talk to a modern woman.

721
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,694
We have nothing in common.

722
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,062
Well, you're both female.

723
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,407
You could talk about things
that are inherently female.

724
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,465
Alright, I'll give it a try.

725
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,768
Otto, we need to go.

726
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,282
Hey, if you two lovebirds want to waste
your time prowling for wine, be my guest.

727
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,547
Elton and I are going to a movie.
Good luck.

728
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,893
Okay, there she is.

729
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,427
Now about the wine...

730
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,656
Relax, I'll take care of it.

731
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,425
Go have fun, let her down easy,

732
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:04,024
and above all, Eye of the Jackal.

733
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,533
You know, I'm still not completely...

734
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,010
Is somebody there?

735
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,126
Okay, who's there?

736
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,001
Berm-Tech's a little different.

737
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,469
In what way?

738
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,481
Turner's a little eccentric.

739
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:54,578
Eccentric?

740
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,585
He talks a lot about vampires.

741
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,883
You know,
the place is full of vampires,

742
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,388
Mike was a vampire.

743
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:09,662
Well, I mean that's a, that's
a standard business term, 'vampire.'

744
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,197
Hmm. I've never heard it.

745
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:18,367
Yeah, it means,
um, it means a hardworking employee.

746
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,170
You know, stays up late,

747
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,846
nose to the grindstone.

748
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:30,583
And the blood is, you know,
if you put your nose to a grindstone,

749
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,350
then more than likely it will bleed.

750
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,219
So blood, so vampire.

751
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,927
Have you ever been married?

752
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,124
I was engaged once, when I was 19.

753
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,191
Oh, okay.

754
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,367
Yeah. He was 30.

755
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:52,671
I should have known
it wasn't going to work.

756
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,478
No, I, I'm sorry,
I don't, I don't want to pry.

757
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,741
Oh, no, that's okay.

758
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,546
He was a, um, a ventriloquist.

759
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,523
It wasn't just him,
I mean, it was the dolls.

760
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,322
You know, the dummies?

761
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,257
Mm hmm, yeah.

762
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,185
Their teeth.

763
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,032
I guess I have a few issues, Otto.

764
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:51,662
We met one night after his act
at a comedy club.

765
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,095
He always made me laugh,

766
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,671
but I mean, he was on the road a lot,
and he traveled from town to town.

767
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,201
And I imagined the worst.

768
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,608
You know, seedy nightclubs,

769
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,411
cheap motels,

770
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,681
groupies.

771
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,719
Groupies?

772
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,247
Ventriloquists have groupies?

773
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,223
Oh, if they're good, absolutely.

774
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:22,497
Yeah. I mean there is something
sensual about ventriloquism, Otto.

775
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:24,967
I mean,

776
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:31,702
the way the rod runs through
the dummy's back.

777
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,210
You know, just twisting
and massaging it,

778
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,339
just right to elicit
the proper emotion.

779
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:43,649
The, the eyes roll back,
the mouth opens.

780
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:50,425
I mean, every move, every look,
caressed out by the artist.

781
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,829
We are still talking about
ventriloquism here, right?

782
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,725
'Cause, wow.

783
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,906
This is nice, Otto.

784
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,275
Maybe we can do it again some time.

785
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,903
What are you doing here?

786
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:47,677
So, you understand, right?
It's a family thing.

787
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,312
Oh, don't worry, Otto, I'll live.

788
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,324
And work is not going to be weird?

789
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,416
No.

790
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,791
Work won't be weird. Promise.

791
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,032
Okay.

792
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,166
Okay.

793
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:06,861
Bye.

794
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,369
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

795
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,003
Okay. Goodnight.

796
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,546
This is for Berm-Tech, Otto,

797
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,746
you said it yourself.
It wasn't personal.

798
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:25,550
I know, I know.

799
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:27,824
What wine did you get?

800
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,552
A couple good ones.

801
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,356
What the hell are these?

802
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,461
The guy said they were good.

803
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,659
Look how dusty they are.

804
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,696
Good wine sits for a while, right?

805
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,431
Did you get these at a liquor store?

806
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,139
Convenience store.

807
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,339
They don't sell good wine
at a convenience store.

808
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,944
We didn't have time for good,
alright?

809
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,775
We needed convenience,
ergo the convenience store.

810
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:52,739
Monroe's gonna kill me.

811
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,410
Hey, how was the movie?

812
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,181
Eye of the Jackal. Nice.

813
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,119
Morning, Pearl.

814
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,292
Good morning.

815
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,225
That's totally my fault.

816
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,597
Jeff, I didn't stop, look and listen.

817
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,299
Completely my blunder, Otto,
I got coffee,

818
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,842
I'll tell you what,
I'll buy you a fresh cup of coffee.

819
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:20,842
No, no need.

820
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,071
I'm fine, really.

821
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,543
But Otto, you got coffee all over
your shirt and your hair.

822
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,776
It, it's okay, actually,
caffeine's good for the scalp.

823
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:27,976
I read that in a medical journal.

824
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:28,784
I'm fine.

825
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:29,216
You good?

826
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,150
Yes, I'm fine.

827
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,084
Okay.

828
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,091
Here I am.

829
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:41,929
But look at me, you know,
not a hint of awkwardness.

830
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:42,658
Yeah.

831
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,495
And you?

832
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,126
No, hey, doing fine.

833
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,134
Is this for real?

834
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,373
And you are?

835
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,952
It's me, Steven.

836
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,857
How long have you had this thing?

837
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,554
Since the forties
if I'm not mistaken.

838
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,425
We are very proud of
our human resources record

839
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,831
where the handicapped are concerned,

840
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:21,393
Steven. I like to say
that here at Berm-Tech

841
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:27,068
we offer you a handshake whether
you have hands, hooks, or flippers.

842
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,275
Good God.

843
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,248
I wouldn't know where to start
with this one.

844
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:40,347
Thank you. I'd stay away
from Human Resources if I were you.

845
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,990
I'm pretty sure Larry's
become a vampire.

846
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,188
Human Resources, now that's irony.

847
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,796
What do you mean, 'missing? '

848
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,430
I mean Rebecca's not here.

849
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,538
Or at least we can't find her.

850
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,375
Cecil and Amos have been
looking for the last hour.

851
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,837
It doesn't seem as though
she made it to bed last night.

852
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,273
Well may, maybe she's back
with Marsden Kershaw.

853
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,346
Or, or that salad guy, you know,
from the kitchen.

854
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,189
Well she sure as hell didn't
absquatulate, that's all I know.

855
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:14,889
So if anyone asks about Rebecca,

856
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,324
just say she's working on
a project with me.

857
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:18,193
Agreed.

858
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,231
Now, Henry, we have to think
responsibly about the Rinse.

859
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,560
No, Bunyan.

860
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,663
Henry, he's not getting any better.

861
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:29,999
We can't do this on our own.

862
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,811
You look for Rebecca,
I'll get us some help.

863
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,007
Alright, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.

864
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,182
Monroe, what was left on the table?

865
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,951
A piece of cake, unit of blood.

866
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,451
Didn't look like anything was eaten.

867
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,856
What did you do with it?

868
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:53,622
Had to chuck it.
Ants in the cake, blood spoiled.

869
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:57,297
Oh, by the way,
I have a question for you, Otto.

870
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:03,303
Is this the wine you bought?
The choice of a connoisseur?

871
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:04,939
Yes.

872
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:08,136
Well, uh, perhaps
we should let them breathe, eh?

873
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,412
You've chosen
the perfect complimentary wine,

874
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,276
if we were eating ass.

875
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,687
Oh, one more thing, Henry,

876
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,959
I noticed that someone sent
that old freezer out to be serviced.

877
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,393
Not the old freezer
next to the dishwasher?

878
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,858
That's the one.

879
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:29,123
Uh, I never understood why we kept
that old thing around, anyway.

880
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,093
Otto,

881
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,336
our problems just
got a whole lot worse.

882
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,909
So that's where it's been
all these years? In an old freezer?

883
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,039
Yep. Every last nugget of
our Nether Stone was in there.

884
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,648
Don't we need that to survive?

885
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,116
How long can we last without it?

886
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:58,827
Uh, we could last three, four days.
Might even make it a week.

887
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,529
So our entire survival was dependent
on a rusty, old freezer?

888
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,833
Well, it was converted
into a safe decades ago.

889
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,707
It was modified so that if anyone was
to tamper with it in any way at all,

890
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:17,406
uh, the interior lead-lined walls would
just automatically lock into place,

891
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,573
so that nobody, least of all a thief,

892
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,446
could feel the effects
of the Nether Stone.

893
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,653
So even if we do get it back,
we're screwed.

894
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:25,745
No, no, no, no.

895
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,720
It can still be opened.

896
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,784
Um, but you need to have two keys.

897
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,627
Now I have one.

898
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,796
Rebecca has the other.

899
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,361
So what do we do?

900
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:41,961
Otto, we can't breathe a word of
this to anyone, alright?

901
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,873
The last thing we need right now
is a company-wide panic.

902
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:52,204
Henry, Otto. Something in the basement
I think you should see.

903
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:57,719
I was down here and I noticed
the door was open a crack.

904
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,148
Light was on.
I came in for a look-see.

905
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,357
It's blood.

906
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,594
Not too old, either.

907
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,493
It's definitely not human.

908
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,594
Anybody, anybody recognize it?

909
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,698
Hmm mm. The knife,

910
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,703
uh, was over here.

911
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,607
Yeah. There's no blood on the knife.

912
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,003
No, none.

913
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,073
What the hell is that?

914
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,214
Hair. Red hair.

915
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:40,452
How the hell does somebody bang
their head on a nine foot ceiling?

916
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,264
There's no good way to do that.

917
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,864
Alright, let's,
Bunyan, get Dr. Berman.

918
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,867
See if we can find out
about this blood.

919
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,728
Why do they call you a mouse?

920
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,866
I mean, how do you feel about that?

921
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,610
Yes? Hello?

922
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:11,220
Uh, that's, uh,
it's time for your vitamins, Turner.

923
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:12,750
Vitamins?

924
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,161
Jumpin' Jerusalem,

925
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,394
don't those things
come in cartoon chewables?

926
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,129
Oh, doctor's orders.

927
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,072
Here, I'll take your...

928
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,902
Yes.

929
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,772
And we're going to,
you will love this, it'll make you...

930
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:27,969
Me likey already.

931
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,238
You likey a lot.

932
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,714
The blood samples from
both the floor and the ceiling are,

933
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:39,777
indeed, A-B negative.

934
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,782
Which tells us exactly nothing.

935
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,554
Obviously,
since we're all A-B negative,

936
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,926
it's either Rebecca Sibley's blood,

937
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,965
or we've got a bigger problem here,
gentlemen.

938
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,476
It looks like
it's been broken a while.

939
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:04,975
But no blood, though, huh?

940
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,205
No.

941
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,510
We are in a real pickle here, Henry.

942
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,246
Oh, yes.

943
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,189
Do you really think Emmitt
and Myrtie took the freezer?

944
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,092
I don't, I don't know.

945
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,123
But as head of security,
Emmitt knew about the freezer,

946
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,131
knew about its contents.

947
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,565
Myrtie had access to the kitchen.

948
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,598
Why?

949
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:32,301
Well, I just think it might be kind
of difficult for the two of them

950
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,371
to get a one ton freezer full
of rock out of here.

951
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,641
Look, let's just wire this door shut
until we can get a lock on it, okay?

952
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,442
Okay.

953
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,385
Oh. Hi, Jewel.

954
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,449
Hey, Pearl.
About time we call it a day, huh?

955
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,786
Oh, gosh, I suppose it is.

956
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,621
I'm looking for Bunyan,
he said he was coming down here.

957
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,394
Oh, yeah,
he was here just a minute ago.

958
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,096
Well he may have left already.

959
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,633
Of course, I can't be sure, you see,
I'm menstruating right now.

960
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,234
So it's difficult to say.
You understand.

961
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:09,736
Are you okay?

962
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:13,146
Oh, gosh, yeah. Nothing a good
feminine hygiene product can't fix.

963
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,815
I like the kind with wings.

964
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,580
Well, I got to go. Good talk, Pearl.

965
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,011
Goodnight.

966
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,395
Berm-Tech Industries, Otto speaking.

967
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,430
You're going to think I'm crazy.

968
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,208
They were eating like it was nothing.

969
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,173
Uh, slow down.

970
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,435
What exactly did you see?

971
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,038
They were eating people and laughing,
Otto.

972
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,881
Like chewing them up
like an afternoon snack.

973
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:27,117
Okay, um, let's meet and talk.

974
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,914
You got to trust me, Pearl,

975
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,553
there is a logical explanation
for this.

976
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,558
Yes, I will bring your purse.

977
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,932
I mean, this whole thing is nuts.

978
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,403
And I knew you were different, Otto,

979
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:51,538
a real throwback guy,
and I thought different was good.

980
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,286
I sure can pick 'em,
which is why I'm pushing 30

981
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:01,723
and my best prospect
is a flesh-eating vampire.

982
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:03,948
Best prospect?

983
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,728
Why didn't you just blow me off?

984
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,964
Instead you had to lie
and say it was a family thing?

985
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,500
It is a family thing.

986
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,897
I got to go.

987
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:19,298
Don't judge us too harshly, Pearl.

988
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:27,346
There is more decency and kindness
and humanity

989
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,885
in that building than I ever saw.

990
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:30,977
I don't know.

991
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,315
The truth is,

992
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:38,259
you getting hired has been the most
exciting work-related event since,

993
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:44,891
since Hickman Moody nailed his hand into
the desk with a pneumatic staple gun.

994
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,963
I'm enjoying work because of you.

995
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,372
Are you coming to work tomorrow?

996
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,858
It'll never work.

997
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,426
He is a vampire, and I'm not.

998
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,003
Leave me alone.

999
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,718
Otto.

1000
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:48,256
Henry read me the riot act
over spilling my guts about the life

1001
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,196
and using the back door to sneak out.

1002
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,694
If we were beasts,
the solution would be obvious.

1003
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,833
Make the problem disappear.

1004
00:57:56,973 --> 00:58:00,238
I guess I didn't want to admit
that option was still on the table.

1005
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:05,312
This is going to go on your permanent
record, Otto. On your permanent record.

1006
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,350
What if she tells somebody?

1007
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,716
Who's she going to tell?

1008
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,583
Friends?

1009
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,349
She doesn't have friends,
she's anti-social.

1010
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:14,154
Family.

1011
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,191
She doesn't have family.

1012
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,156
Her parents died, she has no siblings.

1013
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,554
Otto,
how do you know all this about her?

1014
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,590
I knew you were going to ask that.

1015
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,863
Anyway, no decision could be
made until tomorrow morning,

1016
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:31,373
when our problem either
showed up for work, or not.

1017
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,141
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1018
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,010
Oh, for God's sakes,
Dan, put on some undergarments.

1019
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,004
I'm wearing one.

1020
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:42,215
Come on, Dow, those are for ladies.

1021
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,112
Oh, how right you are, my friend.

1022
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,326
The next morning,
eight o'clock came and went.

1023
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,457
So did eighty-thirty.

1024
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,363
No Pearl.

1025
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,539
There was no time to dwell on it.

1026
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,905
Instead of looking for Rebecca
or the Nether Stone,

1027
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:11,012
Henry asked me to host a babysitting
meeting to keep Turner occupied.

1028
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,914
Sadly, it wasn't terribly different
from most meetings.

1029
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:20,821
So ballpoint pens should be made
available in at least four colors?

1030
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,819
That's a simple fix.

1031
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:26,289
We need to go after
that low hanging fruit, people.

1032
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,956
Waxy Dan,
can you take this action item?

1033
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,556
Oh, I'll knock it out of the park,
Otto.

1034
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,496
Sorry I'm late.

1035
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,329
Morning, Pearl.

1036
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,439
This meeting's been great.
I have to get to another one.

1037
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,042
I always get asked
to pick the low hanging fruit.

1038
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,581
Do you believe I'm capable of
picking the mid-level fruit?

1039
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,751
Oh, hang on, uh, if I drew
this fruit quadrant thing right,

1040
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,722
I don't think there can be
any mid-level fruit to pick.

1041
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:59,117
It's true. Mid-level would require
a nine-square tic-tac-toe config.

1042
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:00,253
People, please.

1043
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,832
Let's not complicate
the strategic fruit maxim.

1044
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,658
I was gosh-bustified
that she came back.

1045
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,532
In an effort to establish a real home
for her at Berm-Tech,

1046
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,838
we worked together to get rid
of all the Mike Yarrow stuff.

1047
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,540
I got it.

1048
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,212
But the thing
that I don't get is 'why? '

1049
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,253
Why coop yourselves up
in here and hide?

1050
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:35,161
I mean, shouldn't you be out
there being superheroes or something?

1051
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,030
I mean, you're kind of immortal.

1052
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,330
Don't you just think
that you're meant for something big?

1053
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,905
Yeah. Sure, I mean,
I thought about it.

1054
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,103
But eventually I came to the conclusion,
and it's one that we all share,

1055
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,773
this gift is as impractical
as it can be.

1056
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,351
It's like somebody
pulled a trick on us.

1057
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,680
What? Like a curse?

1058
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:05,718
Not so much a curse as a test.

1059
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,494
Something to overcome.

1060
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:10,933
It's our cross to bear.

1061
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,361
We're just trying to
maintain our humanity.

1062
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,181
What's this?

1063
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,513
That's when we discovered
a huge piece of the puzzle.

1064
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,310
Whoa, what's wrong?

1065
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,054
Pearl, I'll be back in a few minutes.

1066
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,754
Will you take this stuff
to the basement?

1067
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,825
It's okay.

1068
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,573
You're right.
It's definitely Chesnok Red.

1069
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,910
How lethal is that stuff?

1070
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,477
Oh, it'll kill you.

1071
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,995
What about in smaller doses?

1072
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,430
Like spread out over time?

1073
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,932
It would certainly affect the organs.

1074
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,372
The liver, the pancreas,
the intestines, both large and small.

1075
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,897
The stomach, the kidneys,
most sexual organs.

1076
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,603
And the brain would deteriorate
and begin to lose function.

1077
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,842
Like the retardations.

1078
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,945
"A MONTH AGO"
Precisely, way down.

1079
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,383
Our projected figures for
June were based on aggregate cost...

1080
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:40,479
See,
Turner used to be keen as a blade.

1081
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,953
What's Mike Yarrow doing
in this managers meeting?

1082
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:46,957
Sucking up.
In the vernacular of the times,

1083
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:51,261
Mike was a dick.
A two-faced, kiss ass, toady.

1084
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:52,659
Alright.

1085
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:53,997
Let me top that off for you.

1086
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:54,695
The glasses are...

1087
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,795
No, don't worry.

1088
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:56,964
No, I appreciate what you're trying...

1089
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,529
I mean, continue. You were on a roll.

1090
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:03,168
And, uh, let me say, that tie,
really compliments your eyes.

1091
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,714
Now we know why Mike was always there.

1092
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,346
I'm in now, I'm done with Rebecca.

1093
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,192
Pearl!

1094
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,692
You shouldn't be down here.

1095
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,264
Dow, Dow...

1096
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:02,997
Where's the fire, guys?

1097
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,437
Do you still have Mike Yarrow's PC?

1098
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,997
Yeah. It's right over there.

1099
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,303
Alright, we need you to go through it.

1100
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,139
Uh, the hard drive,
the email, everything,

1101
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:13,376
see if you can find any hint
of a plot to, well, poison Turner.

1102
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:14,943
Plot to poison Turner, huh?

1103
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,075
How, how long will it take?

1104
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,520
No telling, Otto.

1105
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,186
A computer's not
a frigging mellon-baller.

1106
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,917
I don't know
what surprised Bunyan more,

1107
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,152
the discovery of that trap door
in the basement,

1108
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,888
or the fact that I'd spilled
the beans to a first lifer.

1109
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:31,093
...first lifer would be eaten for
merely assuming what you already know.

1110
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,199
Really?

1111
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:32,996
Yes.

1112
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:40,298
Now, getting back to this voice,
are you sure you heard 'Rebecca? '

1113
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,204
I'm pretty sure.

1114
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,947
Are you sure it wasn't 'ricotta? '

1115
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:50,618
Ricotta? Like the cheese?

1116
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:51,277
Yes.

1117
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,652
No.

1118
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,780
Okay. I'm gonna do
a quick look-see around the room,

1119
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,418
can you go get Henry and Otto
and bring them down here chop-chop?

1120
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,219
Yeah.

1121
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,057
Okay.

1122
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,297
So where does it go?

1123
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:05,365
Down.

1124
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,399
Anything?

1125
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:14,275
Yeah. Looks like a bunch of emails
between Mike and someone named Thomas.

1126
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,243
Deleted, but not deleted.

1127
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:16,778
Right.

1128
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,078
Several of them mention

1129
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,479
that Mike's supposed to be
researching something for this guy.

1130
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,172
In one of the emails,

1131
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,083
Thomas requests that Mike should
begin to administer a daily,

1132
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,680
no more than half a gram per day.

1133
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,187
Doesn't specifically mention
Turner poisoned, though.

1134
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,159
When was that?

1135
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:38,030
September 20th. Two months ago.

1136
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,170
Excuse me, Turner?

1137
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,303
Oliver. Here to urinate?
Pull up some porcelain.

1138
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,176
No, thanks, I'm fine.
I was wondering if...

1139
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,875
Is it a penis thing or something,
Oliver?

1140
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,384
'Cause don't worry, I won't look.

1141
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,283
It's a very compelling offer, sir.

1142
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:04,053
But, uh, I wanted to know
if Mike set up the deal

1143
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,253
to hire the productivity consultant?

1144
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,023
The Frenchman?

1145
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:08,664
The Frenchman?

1146
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:09,823
Steven Long-dree?

1147
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,130
Mike's baby?

1148
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,864
Oh, I got this for you.

1149
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,097
Had the Frenchman pick them up.

1150
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:23,836
Keep an eye out for
those tricky little bastards.

1151
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,857
Then a couple of weeks ago,
Thomas stopped writing.

1152
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,584
And all of a sudden,

1153
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:49,331
Mike starts getting very similar
sounding emails from Landry Ventures.

1154
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,099
Steven. The thick plottens.

1155
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,339
See anything you like?

1156
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,883
You look a little tired.
Maybe you should take a nap.

1157
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,451
Otto,
can we borrow you for just a moment?

1158
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:16,954
Yes.

1159
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,828
You really think you're going
to need the Buntline, Henry?

1160
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:26,290
Sure hope not.

1161
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,540
Cheese and crackers, Henry.
I nearly soiled my britches.

1162
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,578
What are you doing down here?

1163
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,641
Came down to get one of those
mothball files out of the archives.

1164
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,986
Hey, what are you all doing down here
in the dark, anyway?

1165
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,186
Care for a little adventure, Jeff?

1166
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,055
No I would not. I would just as soon
get my file and go.

1167
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:58,829
Besides, the last time I checked, trap
doors is supervisors' work, anyway.

1168
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,129
Actually, I don't recall trap doors

1169
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,830
being put in any of
the upper-level job descriptions.

1170
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:05,405
Don't be a drag
on the supply chain here, Jeff.

1171
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,907
I need you to take some ownership.

1172
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,476
Come on. God almighty. Come on.

1173
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,347
What is this? A sewer pipe?

1174
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,381
Well, it seems to
run underneath the alleyway.

1175
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:18,954
What's across the alley?

1176
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:20,347
The Tamerline building.

1177
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,952
Hey Waxy, this tunnel don't
look like it's up to municipal code.

1178
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,919
Are you sure it's wise to cross over?

1179
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,224
Shh, Jeff, come on.

1180
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,199
Get some light on there.

1181
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,175
I didn't know it
took two separate keys.

1182
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,275
I'm never in the loop.

1183
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,977
Well somebody is lying.

1184
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:52,486
Now the question is, are you lying to
me, or has Turner been lying to you?

1185
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,716
Now, we're gonna...

1186
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,689
This is not good.

1187
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,527
Go fetch Dr. Berman,
tell him it's time for the Rinse.

1188
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:01,729
You sure?

1189
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,957
Yeah, just go.

1190
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,297
What the?

1191
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,027
I can hear you in there.

1192
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,663
Go, go, go!

1193
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:14,198
You have exactly three seconds
to come into this room

1194
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,940
before the next sound you hear will be
Bunyan's head exploding like a melon.

1195
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:25,719
One, two...

1196
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:27,815
Alright, Steven,

1197
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,320
let him go.

1198
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:34,385
Oh, right.
I'll do just that little thing.

1199
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,596
Put down the gun or I'll kill him.

1200
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,064
Now you know I can't do that.

1201
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:42,928
If you kill Bunyan, you're dead.
It's that simple.

1202
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:47,099
So, slicing his head off
is a bad negotiating tactic?

1203
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:51,409
How about if I have something else
to bargain with.

1204
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:53,446
What?

1205
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,040
Not what, who.

1206
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,517
Your co-workers.

1207
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,076
Where are they?

1208
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:03,052
Well they're fine,
they're just heavily sedated.

1209
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,257
They're in the drawers.

1210
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,455
I got him, Henry.

1211
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,015
She's dead.

1212
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,919
Emmitt was surprisingly tough.

1213
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,979
It took me two hours
to get anything out of him.

1214
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,991
But Rebecca,

1215
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,423
I take my hat off to Rebecca.

1216
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,487
She gave me nothing.

1217
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:46,464
Absolutely nothing,
and I am persuasive.

1218
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:50,062
Give me the gun.

1219
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:52,437
Jeff.

1220
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,617
Will you look at that?
I have been looking all over for that.

1221
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:07,779
That is the power
of positive thinking.

1222
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,414
Go ahead, get me that key.

1223
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,295
Get out of here, get out of here.

1224
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,126
Oh, she's getting away.

1225
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,410
That's the stuff, Jeff.
Now go get the girl.

1226
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,111
Excellent effort, Granberry.

1227
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,280
I knew you had it in you.

1228
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,950
You see her?

1229
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,016
No.
Can't see a blasted thing down here.

1230
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,528
But if she's still in here,
she'll feel this!

1231
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:52,895
Ah! God almighty! I'm hit.

1232
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:58,032
Ricochets are a freakishly
random event, Jeff. Shake it off.

1233
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,672
Come on up here, roll one of
those barrels over the trap door.

1234
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,342
We don't want any more visitors.

1235
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,872
Bad news.

1236
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,505
I love his can-do attitude.

1237
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,282
This is gonna hurt a lot.

1238
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,015
So this is the Rinse?
How long's it usually take?

1239
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,055
He should feel something
in about five minutes.

1240
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:21,386
Can we leave him
in your capable hands?

1241
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:22,293
Of course.

1242
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,194
Let's go, guys.

1243
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,987
Goodbye, sweet Henry.

1244
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:57,388
Welcome to my hostile takeover.

1245
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:01,097
But it can still be
a win-win situation.

1246
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,528
You want your lifestyle to continue,

1247
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,333
I want the Nether Stone.

1248
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:10,236
I don't see
why we both can't get what we want.

1249
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,572
You're one of us?

1250
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,739
He's not one of us.

1251
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:21,122
You're both right. I am a Nether Man,
but I am not one of you.

1252
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:28,461
I was not randomly generated by a cosmic
crap shoot of genes and chromosomes.

1253
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:33,929
No fellas. I was chosen.

1254
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,903
It was Garfield who hit
on the idea of a heart transplant.

1255
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,370
Let's say I were in agreement
with this, gentlemen.

1256
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,966
Where in the name of Laura Keen

1257
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,638
would we find a willing candidate
for such a procedure?

1258
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,575
I know a man, sir,
whose own heart has failed him.

1259
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,640
This man will die
before the year is out.

1260
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,719
Do you know his whereabouts
at the present time?

1261
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,852
Watson, come here. I want you.

1262
01:14:58,927 --> 01:14:59,859
Yes, Mr. Bell?

1263
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:05,526
Mr. Bell, you're a bright man.

1264
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:14,197
I would consider any favor granted to
my Nether Folk a favor in my own pocket.

1265
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:17,268
I'll do my level best, Mr. President.

1266
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,849
I never thought I'd be
giving my heart to another man.

1267
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:24,846
Buck up, son.

1268
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,946
That may be
my very last humorous remark.

1269
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,750
Why are you doing this?

1270
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,590
Turner has brainwashed
you all into mediocrity.

1271
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:42,961
At Berm-Tech,
all you run is a cubicle.

1272
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,570
Don't you want more?

1273
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:46,369
Like what?

1274
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,903
To live amongst
the humans as their superiors.

1275
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:57,452
And the more Nether Stone you have,
the more powerful you become.

1276
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,045
That's how you're able to walk
in the sunlight.

1277
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:01,721
That's right.

1278
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:06,487
Berm-Tech is going to be expanding.

1279
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:15,965
And those that don't get the ax
will receive greater benefits,

1280
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,736
greater freedom to go outside,

1281
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,773
an incredible retirement package.

1282
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,611
I got my...

1283
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,575
Oh, wait, is that bullet still in you?

1284
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,047
Well, I'm not sure.

1285
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,983
It has gone straight through.
You are fine.

1286
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,547
Have crackers and a ginger ale.

1287
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,359
Can do, can do.

1288
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,454
Granberry,
we are not more evil than you.

1289
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:48,395
We are rising above your way
of survival. At least trying to.

1290
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,198
Oh, I see, yeah.

1291
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:54,739
You're enlightened.
And I'm a monster, right?

1292
01:16:55,744 --> 01:17:00,204
You forget, we both eat people.

1293
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:01,641
Berman, what is going on?

1294
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,712
Take it easy, Turner. Just lie down.

1295
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,118
Listen, Mike Yarrow can't be trusted,

1296
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:10,788
he's only here to steal the stone.

1297
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,254
I killed Mike, didn't I?

1298
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:17,963
Yes.

1299
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,502
This is the Rinse, isn't it?

1300
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:39,083
Maybe, maybe we should go outside
and try the front door.

1301
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,281
Oh, into the daylight? Are you crazy?

1302
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:44,385
How else are we supposed
to get into that building?

1303
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,026
Hey, we're brainstorming here guys,
there are no bad ideas.

1304
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:49,995
Follow me.

1305
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:57,799
Jeff, would you please go make sure
that the barrel has not been moved?

1306
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,500
Can do, captain.

1307
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:08,578
This is not looking good for you guys.

1308
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:19,225
Oh, boss?

1309
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,761
You humans are such a pain in the ass.

1310
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,191
No, no!

1311
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:38,508
Oh, oh, what are you going to do?

1312
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,671
You're going to shoot me
with an empty gun?

1313
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:48,949
Here. It's a six shooter.
Count 'em out. Henry, you...

1314
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:58,794
Ow. Jeff shot himself, and then
three shots in your lovely girlfriend.

1315
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,678
That's a piss poor attitude.

1316
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:17,450
You are not a team player.

1317
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:30,657
Okay, okay, okay, come on.

1318
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,029
No, no, no, no, no.

1319
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,034
Come on. Come here.

1320
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,128
I've never seen anyone stabbed
to death with a gun before.

1321
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,841
I'm afraid she won't make it
through the night, Otto. I'm sorry.

1322
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,573
You know,
I almost hoped she was one of us.

1323
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,577
Turner's last recruit,
so a few bullets would be no big deal.

1324
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,852
She's just flesh and blood,
nothing more than that.

1325
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,758
Obviously she's much more than
that figuratively speaking,

1326
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,663
but from a purely
physiological standpoint,

1327
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:09,067
she's flesh and, uh, yeah, blood.

1328
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,335
I'll just be over here.

1329
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:19,112
Otto, Turner wants to see you.

1330
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,582
Here you go, boysenberry.

1331
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,694
I've had a lot to process today.

1332
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:43,997
But nothing supersedes the importance
of keeping Berm-Tech Industries intact.

1333
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,404
After Rebecca and Henry,

1334
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:54,077
that Bunyan Pritchett
is our go-to guy.

1335
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,580
And that leaves several managerial
positions open.

1336
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,849
And I would appreciate it
if you would take one of those.

1337
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,087
I'll do my level best.

1338
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,023
I know you will.

1339
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,527
I've already spoken with Bunyan.

1340
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:17,533
And he now has the set of files
that contains everything.

1341
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:23,272
Our holdings, our history,
and the stone.

1342
01:21:25,447 --> 01:21:28,905
The stone wasn't in the freezer.

1343
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,615
I know. It was my little secret.

1344
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,821
Why lie to us about it?

1345
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:41,555
The exact reason
that we're in this situation, Otto.

1346
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:45,755
Greed.

1347
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,036
The stone is like a drug,

1348
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,098
I mean, that's why it had to be
broken up in the first place.

1349
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,234
So we do have Nether Stone.

1350
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,572
Yes.

1351
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:05,478
Mike and Jeff spent three years
searching for it. Where is it?

1352
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,350
It's in a lot of little pieces.

1353
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:14,925
And every night it's usually
in the last place that you would look.

1354
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,498
The hideous lamps.

1355
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:27,338
It's so funny. It, it seems
that people often think about

1356
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:35,009
how they would live differently
if they only had a day, or a week.

1357
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,681
They don't ever stop to think about

1358
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:42,587
how they would change
if they had to live forever.

1359
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:47,888
And now there is one more thing
I want to do.

1360
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:04,706
Shh, shh. Don't

1361
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:15,287
So Turner,
like President Garfield before him,

1362
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:18,285
made the ultimate sacrifice.

1363
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:22,395
His leadership carried us
through our darkest times.

1364
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,500
It'll be up to us
now to step into the light.

1365
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,402
All of us.

1366
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:34,068
Okay, so I can see that our
other meeting is about to begin,

1367
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:38,169
so as long as your brief, I'd be happy
to take any questions at his time.

1368
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,377
Just one.

1369
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,172
How long did it take you

1370
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,219
to prepare this little Nether Beast
In Training presentation?

1371
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,452
About a hundred and eight years.

1372
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:57,759
So, that's the way the organization
will look beginning Monday.

1373
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:00,124
There's been a lot of changes,

1374
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,567
and we haven't done a re-org
in quite a long stretch.

1375
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:07,468
We're dead serious about relaxing
the policy on outdoor excursions.

1376
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:12,239
Made possible in part

1377
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:16,110
by a mother load of Nether Stone
involuntarily donated

1378
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,175
by the late Steven P.D. Landry.

1379
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:24,623
But give us a couple of weeks
to get things straightened out.

1380
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:28,229
I'd do a lap around the room for Q&A,
but this is a large group.

1381
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,956
And besides, it's time for lunch.

1382
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:35,566
So let's move in a safe and orderly
fashion down to the dining area.

1383
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:47,841
Long meeting, huh?

1384
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,007
I didn't think lunch
would ever get here.

1385
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:53,616
You hungry?

1386
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:56,854
Starving.

1387
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,530
END
