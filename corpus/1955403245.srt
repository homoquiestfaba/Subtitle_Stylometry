1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:03,101
(waves crashing)

2
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:10,026
(bat wings flapping)

3
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:22,482
(eerie music)

4
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,072
(slow piano tune)

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,951
Well honey, I hope you're comfortable.

6
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:45,754
I realize you might be a little cold,

7
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:47,421
but don't you worry.

8
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:52,588
I'm sure it's plenty
warm where you're going.

9
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:57,857
All I gotta say is, good luck to Satan.

10
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:02,933
That poor son of a bitch has
to deal with your nagging ass.

11
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,847
You won't be needing these anymore.

12
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,930
(quick chiming tune)

13
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:25,091
Consider us divorced.

14
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,508
(eerie tune)

15
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:31,903
What the hell?

16
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:36,132
(explosion)

17
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,744
What the hell is that?

18
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:45,994
(grunting)

19
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,642
(sniffing)

20
00:02:52,642 --> 00:02:55,225
Wow, that's some kind of smoke.

21
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,873
(laughing)

22
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:06,690
(excited mumbling)

23
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:09,341
Oh wow.

24
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:14,653
(quick upbeat tune)

25
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,486
Oh wow.

26
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,418
(grunting)

27
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:28,769
Mmmm.

28
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,472
(laughing)

29
00:03:34,472 --> 00:03:36,305
Oh, wow, look at that.

30
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,469
That's no meteor.

31
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,686
(electric charges)

32
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,936
(grunting)

33
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,335
Whoa.

34
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,222
Well, well.

35
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,972
(dramatic music)

36
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,159
Whoa, wow.

37
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,909
(dramatic music)

38
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:30,093
This is the luckiest day of my life.

39
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,662
(chiming music)

40
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,198
Wow, wow.

41
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,982
Look at you.

42
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,565
You are incredible.

43
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,323
Whoa, you are wow.

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,325
Wow.

45
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,006
You are great.

46
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:56,173
(smooth trumpet tune)

47
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,032
(upbeat music)

48
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,681
♫ Oh no, no, no, no

49
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:09,615
♫ No, no, no, no, no, oh

50
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,505
♫ In the morning, in the night

51
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:16,070
♫ When I don't feel so right

52
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,516
♫ Up through the misty haze,

53
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:21,623
♫ The green all grinding up my days

54
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:24,031
♫ Have a smoke to clear my mind

55
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,685
♫ Just a puff to help unwind

56
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,196
♫ Everywhere I go, I take it

57
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:32,740
♫ Oh it's like I can't escape it

58
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,309
♫ Only thing I need, only thing I need

59
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:40,069
♫ Weed weed, wicked weed

60
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:42,745
♫ Heavy from the devil's seed

61
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,829
♫ Fiending for it every day

62
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,741
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane

63
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,275
♫ Weed, weed, wicked weed

64
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:53,057
♫ You got a hold of me

65
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:55,512
♫ Fiending for it every day

66
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:58,988
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane

67
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:01,953
♫ Light the fire, spark the tree

68
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,266
♫ Make it a part of me

69
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:06,455
♫ Think of all the life it breeds

70
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:09,705
♫ Just growing from those little seeds

71
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,895
♫ I need my smoke today

72
00:06:11,895 --> 00:06:14,958
♫ Work too hard, get home late

73
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,125
♫ I just need a break for
one more toke that I can take

74
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:24,487
♫ Only thing I need, only thing I need

75
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,544
♫ What's that from

76
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,714
♫ Weed, weed, wicked weed

77
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,599
♫ Heavy from the devil's seed

78
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,768
♫ Fiending for it every day,

79
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,758
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane

80
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:38,451
♫ Weed, weed, wicked weed

81
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,293
♫ You got a hold on me

82
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,498
♫ Fiending for it every day

83
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:46,288
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane

84
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,621
(jam music)

85
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:15,876
♫ Oh, feeling the weed, you can't leave

86
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:18,795
♫ Heavy from the devil's seed

87
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:20,837
♫ Fiending for it every day

88
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:23,645
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane

89
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:25,904
♫ Weed, weed, we can't leave

90
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,178
♫ Yeah, we can't leave

91
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,117
♫ You got a hold of me

92
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:29,950
♫ You got it, you got it

93
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,594
♫ Fiending for it every day,

94
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:35,761
♫ You know I want that Mary Jane ♫

95
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:42,463
(birds chirping)

96
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,296
Curious.

97
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,773
Wow.

98
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,744
Astounding, simply astounding.

99
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,661
(electric tapping)

100
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:55,879
Whoa.

101
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,230
Oh my.

102
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:02,786
Oh my gosh, Alistair you fool.

103
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,098
The initial observations
are often the most critical.

104
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,042
I can't trust them to memory.

105
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,190
This is Alistair McDowell
of the Space Institute,

106
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,023
April 20th at o ten hundred hours,

107
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,710
after tracking on radar
what appeared to be a meteor

108
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,477
losing its gravitational orbit,

109
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:22,008
I have entered the woods
just north of the city

110
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,925
following its projected trajectory.

111
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,817
The impact site is littered

112
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:33,316
with what appears to be a grass.

113
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,945
I will now take a sample.

114
00:08:34,945 --> 00:08:37,695
(birds chirping)

115
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,203
Evidence of a substance has been taken

116
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,666
off the outer skin of the meteorite.

117
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,280
Upon further observation,

118
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,692
it seems that rather
than a high density rock,

119
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:06,859
the meteorite seems to be
composed of a metal of some kind.

120
00:09:07,766 --> 00:09:10,348
Formed into a crude sphere.

121
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,685
Huh.

122
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,948
Was this done naturally?

123
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:17,615
Or possibly by some
living, sentient beings?

124
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:23,700
More data is needed, but
the possibility is exciting.

125
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:26,436
Curious.

126
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,195
By the markings on top of this plate,

127
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,836
it looks as if something
had once sat atop it.

128
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:36,278
Maybe, I don't know jostled
loose in space or knocked over.

129
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,111
Hiyah!

130
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,270
Put em up dude.

131
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,129
I am unarmed, I assure you.

132
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,188
Sex, lies, and video tape.

133
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:49,105
I never knew a fed without a strap.

134
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,330
You must have an ankle piece.

135
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,518
I told you, I'm unarmed,
nor am I a fed as you call it.

136
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,570
Do you mean federal officer, as in FBI?

137
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,987
FBI, CIA, DKNY.

138
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:03,179
DKNY?

139
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,374
They're all a part of
same alphabet soup, brother.

140
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,207
But.

141
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,670
Turn around slow, no sudden moves.

142
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,337
(intense music)

143
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:17,088
Larnell.

144
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,465
Al?

145
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:19,440
You look different.

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,576
You been hitting the creatine?

147
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,735
Throwing some weights around?

148
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:22,568
(laughing)

149
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,134
You noticed.

150
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,806
But what the heck are you doing here?

151
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:29,093
Sorry about that, I thought
you might be federal popo.

152
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,218
Well, clearly not.

153
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,245
I mean I'm working for
the Space Institute.

154
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,228
No kidding?

155
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,561
Dude that's great.

156
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,506
Good you got here before the feds.

157
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:37,673
Why is that?

158
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:44,092
Maybe you and I can work
together on this thing.

159
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:47,418
Sweet mother of pearl, I was right.

160
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,174
I was tracking this thing from outer space

161
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,026
and I figured it came down
somewhere right around here.

162
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,288
Wait, you were tracking it, but how?

163
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:57,190
Let's just say I have
access to certain equipment.

164
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,837
The less you know, the better, Al.

165
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,337
Plausible deniability and all.

166
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:03,726
Um, why were you worried

167
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,169
that I might be a federal officer?

168
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,320
Come on dude, the feds
have been covering up

169
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,925
UFO sightings since that flying
saucer crash back in 1947.

170
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:15,196
They still got the alien
dudes locked up in Area 51.

171
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:16,772
They've been feeding the poor little dudes

172
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,940
Old Milwaukee and tater tots.

173
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,773
Taters

174
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:20,606
Hiding them from us because

175
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:23,091
they don't think we can handle the truth.

176
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,709
They've been using their
brains for technology too.

177
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,102
I'm talking about microwave
ovens, cell phones, Hot Pockets.

178
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:29,935
Hot Pockets?

179
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:30,918
And Jimmy Cameron.

180
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:32,746
Wait, Jim Cameron, the movie director?

181
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:35,583
Yeah, he's their offspring.

182
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,054
The aliens's I mean.

183
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:37,887
Come on Al,

184
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:41,378
Avatar is like a five hour
love letter to his home planet.

185
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:43,861
But the fed dunes think us
dumb yokels can handle it

186
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,535
because it's just a story.

187
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,070
Well not me, baby.

188
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,343
I don't know about all that,
but what about the meteorite?

189
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,292
Don't snow me Al, I heard you talking

190
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,958
to your little tape recorder
when I snuck up on you.

191
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,710
You know this thing ain't no space rock.

192
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,127
It's a spaceship.

193
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,575
You and I can expose
the secret to the world.

194
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,545
Those fed goons will have no choice

195
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,497
but to let those poor little
aliens out of lock up.

196
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:06,515
I don't anything about that,

197
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,528
but I've never seen a study

198
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,491
of the meteorite like this before.

199
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:12,414
(sniffing)

200
00:12:12,414 --> 00:12:13,747
You smell that?

201
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,388
(sniffing)

202
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:17,971
(trippy music)

203
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,943
Come on dude, don't tell
me you don't recognize it,

204
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:24,386
not after everything we've been through.

205
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,703
(sniffing)

206
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,848
Oh my goodness, you're right,

207
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:28,935
it smells like some kind of marijuana.

208
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,683
Look at all this stuff.

209
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,561
Don't touch it, we have
no idea of its toxicity.

210
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:36,809
Let me toke some of this shit

211
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,725
and I'll take my own fucking rating.

212
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,106
I think the scientific
method will be safer.

213
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:41,939
Safe?

214
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,772
Right.

215
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:44,732
We're all living on
borrowed time anyways, Al.

216
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:48,346
The Armageddon clock is
running down, you know.

217
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:49,581
Armageddon?

218
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,007
How exactly have you
been occupying your time

219
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:51,880
since I saw you last?

220
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,029
It's been, what, a couple years?

221
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,044
Well, homeland security is after me.

222
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:58,550
No biggie, just a little mix
up at the Afghan boarder.

223
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,169
Jeez, Afghanistan?

224
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,010
It was totally innocent, bro.

225
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,752
I was over there with my old buddy Faruk,

226
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,412
scoring some high grade poppy when.

227
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,710
Okay, kay, maybe you
actually shouldn't tell me.

228
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,043
I mean afterall, plausible

229
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,019
Deniability, gotcha.

230
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,563
Anyways, I've been living
further off the grid.

231
00:13:13,563 --> 00:13:16,397
Had to change up my look
too, just to be safe.

232
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:18,330
Went over to the Supercuts on Sepulveda

233
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,603
and had that crater face Shauna

234
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:21,742
fix me up with a color and a cut.

235
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,391
She done me pretty good, too.

236
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:26,619
Got me looking like Zac Efron and shit.

237
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,728
Plus, I've been training
with a ninja master.

238
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,276
Gotta protect myself.

239
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,291
A ninja master?

240
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,382
Well, master might be pushing it.

241
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,433
The dude works in stolen car stereos.

242
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,535
But trust me, Wang Dong knows his shit.

243
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,087
That's why he's got me
dressing all in black.

244
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,381
So I can move with the shadows

245
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:46,157
and strike from the heart of darkness.

246
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:46,990
Sa sa.

247
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:51,578
The drunken monkey is a terrible
thing when unleashed, Al.

248
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:55,150
I hope you never, ever have to witness it.

249
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,733
(upbeat music)

250
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,432
♫ And here we go

251
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,081
♫ Sitting all alone with not much to do

252
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,779
♫ Thinking to myself I need
to change my point of view

253
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,389
♫ If only there was something
that could occupy my hands

254
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:17,003
♫ I need something to do
because I don't have any plans

255
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,534
♫ A new point of reference
to change what I receive

256
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:22,242
♫ Something that was
anything but me I do believe

257
00:14:22,242 --> 00:14:24,608
♫ Changing my mind is
what I want to achieve

258
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:27,234
♫ And if you ask me what I'm
saying, I'm a private seed

259
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,818
♫ You see I need to get
high, I need to get drunk

260
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:32,303
♫ A little something good to
help me out of this funk ♫

261
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,720
(eerie tone)

262
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:44,886
(eerie music)

263
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:09,558
(broken bell clicking)

264
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,053
Uh, hello?

265
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,136
Anybody here?

266
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:24,002
Dude, you've got to cut out the noise.

267
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,477
Noise?

268
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:26,992
I just said hello.

269
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,176
Correction, you followed
that with is anybody here.

270
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,112
And that was after you pounded

271
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,966
on my bell here for like five minutes.

272
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,337
Well, it wasn't five minutes

273
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,978
and if you heard it, you
should've come out sooner.

274
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,061
Heard what?

275
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,128
The bell.

276
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:44,211
Oh dude, bell's broken.

277
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:48,923
Anyway, I've got something here

278
00:15:49,986 --> 00:15:53,486
that I think you'll find very interesting.

279
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:59,240
(high pitched tone)

280
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,073
Whoa.

281
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,043
Looks like some kind of space bong.

282
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,709
That's exactly right.

283
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,542
No shit.

284
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:12,794
Hey hey hey hey, not
until we discuss price.

285
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,547
Well is it really from space?

286
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:15,579
Yeah.

287
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:17,140
Prove it.

288
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,257
(laughing)

289
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:20,911
Come on man.

290
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:21,829
Just look at it.

291
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,504
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

292
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,531
(laughing)

293
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:29,572
Dude you got some serious
fuzz tongue going on.

294
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,739
Like right in that, there.

295
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,158
(grunting)

296
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:44,431
Yeah, yeah, I gotta go
see the doctor about that.

297
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,668
Yeah, you need some medicinal.

298
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:50,002
Anyway, do you think
your shop could use this?

299
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:53,070
Are we gonna do some business?

300
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,149
Yes, I think we are definitely
gonna do some business.

301
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:57,982
(laughing)

302
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:01,958
Let me figure out how to
open up the cash register.

303
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,332
What are you doing?

304
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,865
I was just helping the customer.

305
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:07,745
Hey, back off slick, we
were just doing business.

306
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:08,578
Yeah.

307
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:09,833
Back off?

308
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,392
I'm the cowner of this place.

309
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,873
Don't be telling me to back off, jack off.

310
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:14,706
Hey man.

311
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:17,153
Hey, I don't want you ripping
us off with some bull shit.

312
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:18,992
Yeah, I heard you from the back.

313
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:21,210
Space bong, my ass.

314
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,125
This looks like some bad movie prop.

315
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,125
Yeah, like from 2001 Weed Odyssey.

316
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,308
(laughing)

317
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:32,891
Hey look, I'll make
a good deal with you.

318
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:37,424
Maybe we could do
something with this, too.

319
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,469
Only been used once.

320
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:45,886
(eerie tone)

321
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:53,465
Hey, pud knocker, this a
head shop, not a pawn shop.

322
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:59,095
Um, dude that would look
pretty rad in the shop though.

323
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,906
Yeah, well, maybe so

324
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:04,569
but we ain't paying out the wazoo for it.

325
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,140
No, we're not paying
out the wazoo for it.

326
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,129
50 bucks.

327
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,245
50?

328
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:09,941
I'll pay you 20 for it.

329
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:11,183
It's worth more than that.

330
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,519
Hey, I gotta make a profit too.

331
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,863
Fifty bucks, and I'll throw
in the jewels and the knife.

332
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,363
I don't want your shit, man.

333
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,246
Cash money.

334
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,842
What's with the gloves?

335
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,755
I got burned.

336
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:35,966
Really?

337
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,286
Let's see.

338
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,940
No, no I can't do that.

339
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,773
You want the 20 bucks don't you?

340
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,917
Whoa.

341
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:49,378
Oh, monkey.

342
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,345
Dude, you are totally molding.

343
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:52,845
That's not good.

344
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,746
Take your shit and get out of here.

345
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:59,329
And don't touch anything, fuck!

346
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,522
Fuck both of you.

347
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:11,376
(muffled rap music)

348
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:19,366
Hey, where are you going?

349
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,882
Dude, you cannot expect
me to put new merchandise

350
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:24,786
on the shelf without testing it out first.

351
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,691
That would be irresponsible.

352
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:31,058
Why I ever went into
business with you is beyond me.

353
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:32,580
Oh, because when your career in sports

354
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,776
went down the shitter you had
to do something, remember?

355
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,121
(smacking)

356
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,208
Thanks for reminding me.

357
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,347
Nobody takes that thing before

358
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,528
we find out what it's all about.

359
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,552
Hey, you know who might
know something about it?

360
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:46,385
Who?

361
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,218
Al.

362
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,000
Who?

363
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,393
Al, you know the geek?

364
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,780
The one who helped us kill the
evil bong and the king bong?

365
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,124
Oh, but technically we didn't

366
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,557
kill the evil bong, remember?

367
00:19:57,557 --> 00:20:00,639
It was still down there in
the jungle when we left.

368
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,436
You remember the pootang tribe?

369
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,019
Talk about National Geographic.

370
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,749
National pornographic, you mean.

371
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:12,070
Put it back on the counter.

372
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,903
(grunting)

373
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:15,030
You're not the boss of me.

374
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:19,224
Look, violence never solved anything, man.

375
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:22,614
(slow jam music)

376
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,281
(phone dialing)

377
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,310
Hey Al.

378
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,237
Yeah, it's Brett.

379
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,154
Hey, how are you buddy?

380
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:40,783
Tell me what to do,
I'll tell you what to do.

381
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,533
Assholes around here.

382
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,893
Alright, product testing.

383
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:49,393
(eerie music)

384
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:54,630
Here we go.

385
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,476
(water bubbling)

386
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:01,615
(electricity jolting)

387
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,032
You are a worm.

388
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:05,461
A parasite.

389
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,980
Being this close to you disgusts me.

390
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,433
Now that's uncalled for.

391
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,834
I tolerate it only because I must.

392
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:15,169
You are the first step in my quest

393
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,687
for total domination of your world.

394
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:20,138
You got a nasty 'tude for a bong.

395
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:23,680
You gotta chill out or no
one's gonna wanna buy you.

396
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,707
Now shut up while I smoke you.

397
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:28,179
(dramatic music)

398
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,929
(electric tones)

399
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,651
Oh now, monkey!

400
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:42,592
(quick whipping music)

401
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:49,170
[Voiceover] Welcome to my world, worm.

402
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,913
(eerie tune)

403
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,673
Oh snap.

404
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,524
Hi there.

405
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:01,450
Dude.

406
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:06,149
You could use some lotion.

407
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,402
That's okay, that's okay.

408
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:10,902
(eerie music)

409
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:15,832
You chicks are a little aggressive.

410
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,866
That's alright.

411
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,586
I'm into it.

412
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:22,919
So, is this like, a three way situation?

413
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,124
I'm into it.

414
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,014
It's okay.

415
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:29,514
(eerie music)

416
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:36,527
Ow, that's, that's kinda painful.

417
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:43,226
(moaning)

418
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,643
(eerie tune)

419
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,993
Monkey.

420
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,447
(psychedelic tune)

421
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:07,481
♫ I think God smokes weed

422
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,844
♫ And he was high when he made me

423
00:23:11,844 --> 00:23:15,344
♫ I can feel it in my DNA

424
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,852
♫ I think God smokes weed

425
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:25,186
♫ And he was high when he made me

426
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,034
♫ And I think he gave up ♫

427
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:27,867
Larnell.

428
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:28,700
(screaming)

429
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,440
Would you relax man,
you're wigging me out.

430
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,958
I gotta keep the blood flowing
bro or else I get stagnant

431
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,199
and the palpitations and
panic attacks kick in.

432
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,737
You're a few skittles
short of a full bag.

433
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,839
You've got to stop
chasing black helicopters.

434
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,947
Yeah.

435
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,972
What do you make of the bong, Al?

436
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:45,904
Well, it's most certainly
of unknown origin.

437
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,398
And the material used to form it

438
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:49,499
is like nothing I've ever seen.

439
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,348
I'll know more when I take it back

440
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:51,828
to the lab and run some tests.

441
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:53,358
We were on our way there when you called.

442
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:54,502
Well as much as I love you, Al,

443
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,714
you're not taking that
thing out of my shop

444
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,090
until I get my investment back.

445
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,285
I paid like twent... a hundred
bucks for that thing.

446
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,820
[Al] The base of this
would fit perfectly

447
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,954
in that receptacle we
found in the meteorite.

448
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:05,954
Meteorite?

449
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,516
Spaceship, dude.

450
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:14,404
(muffled reggae music)

451
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,769
So you're actually telling us

452
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,476
this thing might be from space?

453
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:21,749
Well, the possibility exists, yes.

454
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:24,173
(yelling)

455
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,006
What was that?

456
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,140
Relax there, master of
dung poo, it's just Bachman.

457
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,724
Oh, I thought I recognized his voice.

458
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:32,185
Where is brother Bach?

459
00:24:32,185 --> 00:24:34,001
Wouldn't mind giving him some hello nugs.

460
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,478
I think he's in the back bone smuggling

461
00:24:35,478 --> 00:24:37,198
one of those fat chicks again.

462
00:24:37,198 --> 00:24:38,833
I have no idea where
he finds these broads.

463
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:39,666
I caught him beating off

464
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,068
to an old school Star
Jones interview once.

465
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,608
Brutal.

466
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,889
Bachman!

467
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:45,972
Get out here.

468
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:51,064
Listen Al, I don't have 60 bucks.

469
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:54,429
Living off the grid has
its disadvantages, man.

470
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:56,949
Well, I don't have
any money on me either.

471
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,673
Bummer, I was hoping to
score some Taco Bell later.

472
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:01,423
Chalupas make me wet.

473
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:05,325
(playful music)

474
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,499
(groaning)

475
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:14,582
You putzes.

476
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:17,954
Hey, Luann.

477
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:19,916
As usual, you are a sunbeam,

478
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,063
floating on a cloud of happiness.

479
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:26,724
Did anybody ever tell
you that black is O U T?

480
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:28,723
Shadows don't care about style.

481
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:29,912
(scoffing)

482
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,758
Could you be a bigger loser?

483
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:33,725
Is that even possible?

484
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:36,475
(slow jam music)

485
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,365
Well I mean, it's obviously

486
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:42,516
Um, it's nice to see you, Luann.

487
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:43,781
It's been some time.

488
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,281
Not long enough.

489
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,712
Is this Brett's store?

490
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,224
What, you don't know?

491
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:57,168
Well, let's just say him
and me kind of lost touch.

492
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:59,306
(broken bell clicking)

493
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:00,389
Is he around?

494
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,742
Well, yeah, he just kind went.

495
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:07,660
He peaced out for a little bit

496
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,422
and we're not really
sure when he'll be back.

497
00:26:10,422 --> 00:26:11,685
Yeah.

498
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:14,973
Yeah, and he left us
in charge temporarily.

499
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,858
Would you like to purchase a water pipe?

500
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:20,164
It's only slightly used and
in near perfect condition.

501
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,527
In fact, we'll give you 30 percent off.

502
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:26,194
What the hell do I
need once of those for?

503
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:31,143
Look, Lu, it matches your eyes.

504
00:26:31,143 --> 00:26:34,060
Get that away from me, you idiot.

505
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,167
(sighing)

506
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,923
When Brett comes back,

507
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:46,932
tell him to call me.

508
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,383
If you think you can remember that.

509
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:57,966
(upbeat music)

510
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:09,017
(door slamming)

511
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,798
I don't think she likes us, dude.

512
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,734
Shit that was close.

513
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,247
Hey, thanks for getting rid of her.

514
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,842
Oh hey, she wants you to have that.

515
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:18,621
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

516
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:21,087
I take it your relationship
is no longer kosher.

517
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:22,912
Not unless kosher is restraining order.

518
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,376
She has a restraining order on you?

519
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,572
Dude, I have a restraining order on her.

520
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:30,502
In case you haven't noticed,
she's a bit of a handful.

521
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:34,282
When we were down in South
America, I lost like 400 pounds.

522
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:37,132
I didn't realize she's
not very supportive.

523
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:38,615
Really?

524
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,000
Geez, listen to me.

525
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,976
Not very supportive?

526
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,570
That sounds like some Opera shit.

527
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:46,398
The thing is, I just
keep falling back for it.

528
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,403
She's a hot piece of ass,

529
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:51,188
but then those true
psycho colors come out.

530
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:54,361
Anyway, thanks for having my back, boys.

531
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,397
[Larnell] Where is Bach?

532
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:57,553
He wasn't back there.

533
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,019
Dude, we heard him.

534
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,160
Well he must've snuck out the back then.

535
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,783
So what are you gonna do
with that thing anyway?

536
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,165
It's an alien bong bro.

537
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:08,731
Okay, X-files, alien bong.

538
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,245
What the hell do we do?

539
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:11,931
(door opening)

540
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:14,598
What you do is pray, brothers.

541
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:18,375
Mr. Rabbit, how are you?

542
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:20,627
Just Rabbit, brother, just Rabbit.

543
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,971
I can't believe you're still
pulling that priest scam.

544
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:24,305
Oh, it's no scam.

545
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:25,388
I assure you.

546
00:28:26,534 --> 00:28:29,530
You know, I'll never forget

547
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,433
my experience with the poontang tribe,

548
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:36,600
nor will I forget the promise
I made to a higher power,

549
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,273
in exchange for saving my life.

550
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:43,867
Dude, we saved your life.

551
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:45,075
(laughing)

552
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:47,057
Oh really, did you?

553
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,474
Or were your hands guided by.

554
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,152
(holy tone)

555
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,973
You see, after I was rolled into a doobie

556
00:28:55,973 --> 00:28:58,723
and shrunken to microscopic size,

557
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:03,720
I began to see the world as it truly is.

558
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
A microcosm.

559
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:10,115
We're all just little flakes
on the same blue ball.

560
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:16,384
We're all together, and
we should behave as such.

561
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:20,996
Rabbit, have you
already been toking today?

562
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:25,163
I assure you, sir, my vision
has never been more clear.

563
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,827
Silly Rabbit, religious
institutions are corrupt, man.

564
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,113
They've been covering up the UFO sightings

565
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,236
just like the government.

566
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:38,216
Dude, I have it on good authority

567
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:42,816
that the pope himself has
been abducted and probed.

568
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,899
My poor, deluded child.

569
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:48,631
I belong to no institution.

570
00:29:49,518 --> 00:29:51,798
I am just me, myself, and I.

571
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:55,282
Travelling the road, spreading the word.

572
00:29:55,282 --> 00:29:56,665
What the hell are you
doing here anyway, man?

573
00:29:56,665 --> 00:29:58,820
I mean, we're kinda busy with something.

574
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,671
I dropped in to see Bachman.

575
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:04,184
We were gonna have a spiritual powwow.

576
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:07,084
Oh, a little powwow with the wow wow?

577
00:30:07,084 --> 00:30:09,111
A little powwow that
you two in the back room

578
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,203
when it's all full of smoke?

579
00:30:11,203 --> 00:30:14,090
I have no idea what you're referring to.

580
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,915
Oh yeah, yeah right.

581
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,183
You know, how I ever got hooked up

582
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,627
with you losers is beyond me.

583
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:20,958
You had no arm bag.

584
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:24,396
They drugged you out of the minor leagues.

585
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:25,804
(glass shattering)

586
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,719
How's that for no arm, Curious George?

587
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:29,348
Ow.

588
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:30,864
Hey, you got a comment too?

589
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,784
No, no, I just.

590
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:33,784
Holy shit.

591
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,860
That's where that weird
guy touched the counter.

592
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,059
[Al] Weird guy?

593
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,766
[Brett] The guy I bought the bong from.

594
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:44,258
He had this green shit all over his hands.

595
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:46,812
It looks a lot like the
odd vegetation we discovered

596
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,302
at the crash site of the meteorite.

597
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:49,162
Spaceship.

598
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:52,242
Yeah, very well, spaceship.

599
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:55,668
Oh, I can compare it
to some of the samples

600
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:57,751
I took at the crash site.

601
00:30:58,771 --> 00:30:59,604
Wow.

602
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,673
The growth rate is astounding.

603
00:31:03,673 --> 00:31:04,806
Don't touch it.

604
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,474
The other dude had this
stuff growing all over him.

605
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:08,609
It's some sort of space fungus.

606
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:11,859
(light dramatic music)

607
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,611
(water bubbling)

608
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:43,861
(light dramatic music)

609
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,491
This herb is of inferior quality.

610
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,247
I'll have you know,
that this is some primal.

611
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:01,075
Wait a second, did you just talk?

612
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:04,460
I see no one ends in
this room, right boy?

613
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,295
What is it with all you talking bongs?

614
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:08,164
(laughing)

615
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:11,853
Do you have a voice activated
chip in you or something?

616
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,342
Unhand me you worm.

617
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:16,057
Hey, hey, hey, worm?

618
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,546
That's kinda, hey, that's kinda strong.

619
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:20,351
You are repugnant to me,

620
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:24,357
as you might find a maggot distasteful.

621
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:25,601
I tolerate you only because

622
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,782
the process is still
in its earlier stages.

623
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:29,909
Process?

624
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:32,133
There is the work I must do here

625
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:35,212
and that which must be done on my world.

626
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:37,369
So, the guys weren't joking

627
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,020
when they said you were an alien bong.

628
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,353
It is no joke.

629
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:46,098
It is the beginning of
the end for your world

630
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,766
and the dawning of my dominance.

631
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,598
(laughing)

632
00:32:50,598 --> 00:32:53,393
You are a real downer, my brother.

633
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:55,431
(laughing)

634
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:59,738
You are about to go
downer the rabbit hole.

635
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:02,767
Oh yes, yes, smoke up oldie.

636
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,017
(laughing)

637
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,892
(dramatic chiming)

638
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:14,165
Rabbit, no!

639
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,054
Oh, not again.

640
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:19,379
He's been abducted.

641
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:20,588
The bong got him.

642
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:21,872
What I said, abducted.

643
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:24,267
Perhaps we can argue
semantics later, gentlemen.

644
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:26,246
The bottom line is, Rabbit's gone.

645
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:28,957
And perhaps the same
thing happened to Bachman.

646
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:30,831
What is it with these
fucking bongs anyway?

647
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,025
Why do we always end up
finding these things?

648
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:34,775
Dude, they find us.

649
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:37,988
We have to help him.

650
00:33:37,988 --> 00:33:39,138
Are you serious?

651
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:40,604
Do you remember what happened last time?

652
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,007
The last two times?

653
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,954
Well, we made it out.

654
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,868
That's beside the point.

655
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:47,732
We don't know what the
hell is on the other side.

656
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:49,113
Dude, I'll bet this alien bong

657
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,736
wants to take over the world,

658
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,893
it's part of an invasion plot.

659
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,703
Like Independence Day?

660
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:55,558
War of the Worlds?

661
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:56,658
This little thing?

662
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:59,697
(quick intense music)

663
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,280
Don't touch me, you parasite.

664
00:34:03,696 --> 00:34:07,475
Don't trip dude, we come
in peace and all that stuff.

665
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:11,153
You insignificant specs of fecal matter.

666
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:12,901
Here's how we handle the invasion.

667
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:14,303
Wait, wait, wait.

668
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,610
If you destroy it we might never
get back Rabbit or Bachman.

669
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,610
Alright then, what do you suggest?

670
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,952
(evil laughing)

671
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:27,438
Yes, scamper away you little pansies.

672
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:30,105
(evil laughing)

673
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,875
Sweet Jesus.

674
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,708
Whoa.

675
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:44,476
(eerie music)

676
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:47,187
Man, I'm gonna have to get
some serious weed killer.

677
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:50,662
Maybe it feeds on the stuff,
man, you gotta be careful.

678
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:52,159
Oh no, we seem to have encountered

679
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,949
some kind of alien intelligence.

680
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,782
Or A I.

681
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:58,385
You mean A high.

682
00:34:58,385 --> 00:34:59,635
[Brett] Shit.

683
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,911
Okay Al, you're the brains around here.

684
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,618
How do you propose we
fight the alien bong?

685
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:09,314
Well, we were only able
to defeat the king bong

686
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:12,525
with the help of a certain person.

687
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:15,758
Well, I mean, not a person, but.

688
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,849
You mean the evil bong.

689
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,385
Yeah, right, who wants
to see that bitch again?

690
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,845
Besides, we left her nag
ass down in the jungle.

691
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,440
Well, no doubt Larnell's grandfather

692
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,267
has her in his possession.

693
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,829
He seemed quite enamored of her.

694
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,594
We left the old man down there too.

695
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,501
Good fucking riddance.

696
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:34,519
Actually, he's not down there anymore.

697
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,540
How do you know?

698
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,300
Kinda been keeping tabs on him.

699
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,566
Why?

700
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:41,940
It was my impression
that your relationship

701
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,758
with him was no longer cordial.

702
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:45,208
Yeah, he's been hating on you ever since

703
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,582
your mom front squirted you out.

704
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:48,526
I didn't wanna take the chance

705
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:50,745
of him showing up and surprising me again.

706
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:53,132
Like he did down in South America.

707
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,518
So where is he?

708
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,351
I mean does he run the local

709
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:57,248
butt plug convention
or something like that?

710
00:35:57,248 --> 00:36:01,029
Let's just say that gramps
has turned over a new leaf.

711
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:04,029
(psychedelic music)

712
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,493
Is this the great beyond?

713
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,806
Have I crossed over?

714
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:21,472
(laughing)

715
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,555
A bare angel.

716
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:27,566
Oh, this must be my reward
for all the good deeds I do.

717
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,688
Or maybe not.

718
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:35,166
Maybe it's not heaven,
maybe it's that other place.

719
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:38,258
Well, Lord, if it is that other place,

720
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:40,370
let my punishment begin.

721
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,620
(laughing)

722
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:59,318
Dude, you just sounded like a chick.

723
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:03,787
Oh, brother Bachman, I see
you too have crossed over.

724
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:05,647
I don't know about that shit, bro.

725
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,807
But I've been banging these
chicks since I got here.

726
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:11,413
They've milked me of
so much monkey powder,

727
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:13,984
I don't know how I'm still standing.

728
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,151
(moaning)

729
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:21,164
What do you mean by milked you?

730
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:24,850
Like, for safe keeping, you
know like when I'm sleeping.

731
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,380
See, the wang looking tentacle combines

732
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,536
with the aliens' spunky to
form like this super splooge.

733
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:31,618
That's why it's great.

734
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,226
That's not my normal color, by the way.

735
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:36,147
And then they keep it in these jars.

736
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,572
It's like they're trying
to populate the place

737
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:41,644
with a bunch of little baby
Bachmans running around.

738
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:42,811
How cool, huh?

739
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,646
Brother, that fills me with a horror

740
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:51,686
that you cannot even imagine.

741
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,853
If by horror, you mean
fucking awesome, then I concur.

742
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,877
I don't know about this, girls.

743
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:04,456
(nervous laughing)

744
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:08,188
Oh, just go with it bro,
it's all part of their game.

745
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,938
It's cool, it's cool.

746
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:13,054
Geeky!

747
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:15,343
(laughing)

748
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,296
(moaning)

749
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,546
Rabbit likes.

750
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:22,881
I am full of joy.

751
00:38:24,775 --> 00:38:27,657
Whoa, you're inside
me, how is that possible?

752
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,907
(laughing)

753
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,444
(eerie chiming music)

754
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,643
(laughing)

755
00:38:39,643 --> 00:38:41,313
What the hell was that?

756
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:44,416
Sounded like Rabbit, he's
gotta be in the bong world.

757
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,532
Are they killing him or what?

758
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,249
(laughing)

759
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:50,970
Uh, he doesn't sound
like he's in any distress.

760
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,057
He's getting his rocks off.

761
00:38:53,057 --> 00:38:53,890
That doesn't sound like any kind

762
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,260
of alien invasion I've ever heard of.

763
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,167
No, don't you get it, man?

764
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,910
That's the genius of it.

765
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,559
They attack us where we're
the weakest, our anacondas.

766
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,406
I don't know about you bro,

767
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,156
but I'm strongest in my anaconda.

768
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,641
(mysterious music)

769
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,992
(throat clearing)

770
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:13,568
(screaming)

771
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:16,735
Who was it summoned the good doctor?

772
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,878
That'd be me, gramps.

773
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:20,711
You?

774
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:23,278
Yeah, me.

775
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,028
It's good to see you.

776
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,834
You?

777
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,947
Yeah, me, it's good to see you.

778
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:33,777
Yes, well I wish I could say the same.

779
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:36,414
But I enjoy my flare
ups of my genital herpes

780
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:40,661
more than I do seeing
your insipid face again.

781
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:42,508
Shoulda known you haven't changed.

782
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,024
Ah, but I have.

783
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:46,107
You can call me Dr. Weed.

784
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,020
And this is my personal
assistant, Nurse Hookah.

785
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,959
What the shit?

786
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:57,939
Are you trying to tell me that

787
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,790
you're selling medical weed now?

788
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,044
Well, since my experiences
in South America,

789
00:40:03,044 --> 00:40:06,901
I decided to join the enemy, so to speak.

790
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:09,477
And it's proved very lucrative.

791
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:11,543
Not that you layabouts would

792
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,735
know anything about making money.

793
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:15,301
Hey, back off Jerry Garcia.

794
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:17,333
This joint is my place.

795
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,532
Some impressive items around here,

796
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:24,533
but you will be foreclosed
on within two months.

797
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:26,064
Thanks a lot old man.

798
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,955
I was given to understand

799
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,220
that the sell of medicinal marijuana

800
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,596
was done only in pharmaceutical shops.

801
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,171
Ah, yes, I recalled you were one of the

802
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:38,004
brighter elements in
this gang of nincompoops.

803
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:43,246
If one can make such comparisons
among the lower forms.

804
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:45,121
But you were correct, nerd,

805
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:48,473
in alluding to the
popularity of the shops.

806
00:40:48,473 --> 00:40:52,055
But those are for amateurs, morons.

807
00:40:52,055 --> 00:40:55,222
They're targets for miscreant thieves.

808
00:40:56,582 --> 00:41:00,749
Pimps and gangbangers shooting
each other just for a taste.

809
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:05,431
Now, the only way to
go is special delivery.

810
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:10,082
So, let's get down to some business, ay?

811
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:15,567
Oh, shit.

812
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,686
Besides the traditional seeds and weeds,

813
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,587
I've got brownies, cookies, ice cream,

814
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,670
even newfangled lemonade.

815
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,243
One taste will blast you over the moon.

816
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,495
(laughing)

817
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:30,013
Actually gramps, we
kinda need your help.

818
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:32,155
The only help you're
likely to get from me

819
00:41:32,155 --> 00:41:34,322
is a retroactive abortion.

820
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,161
I shoulda known.

821
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,781
But we're serious Mr., um,
I mean, gra, uh, Dr. Weed.

822
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,246
Really serious, gramps.

823
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:45,898
Like the whole world is
screwed kind of serious.

824
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:47,581
What are you babbling on about?

825
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:48,936
Well, we're not sure but.

826
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:51,746
It's an invasion,
aliens from another world

827
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:54,067
planning a take over of Earth.

828
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:55,891
Since the day your
mother squeezed you out

829
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:59,809
of her rectal cavity, you've
been nothing but misery for me.

830
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,873
And now you're giving me this bullshit

831
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:04,206
about invasions from aliens?

832
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,803
Let's get out of here, nursey.

833
00:42:07,803 --> 00:42:08,636
Wait.

834
00:42:08,636 --> 00:42:10,969
We can prove it, we think.

835
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:18,481
(psychedelic music)

836
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:26,483
[Larnell] There it is, the
advance scout of the invasion.

837
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:27,316
What of it?

838
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:29,074
It's a cheap movie prop.

839
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:30,796
That's what I thought at first too, but.

840
00:42:30,796 --> 00:42:31,900
But what?

841
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,167
Spit it out, you incompetent imbecile.

842
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,523
Two of our friends checked
out gramps, we think the bong

843
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:37,740
We believe that there's

844
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,426
a possibility that the
bong has taken them.

845
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,564
You clowns must take me for
the biggest rube in history.

846
00:42:44,564 --> 00:42:46,564
Give it a sec, gramps.

847
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,858
(light dramatic music)

848
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:53,146
Well come on, say something, damnit.

849
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,421
Show us your power over us little ants.

850
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:58,671
(light dramatic music)

851
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:05,335
He's shutting us out, dudes, not cool.

852
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:07,089
Bong's being a total D-bag.

853
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,256
Total D-bag.

854
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,996
No, no, no, wait, wait.

855
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:17,246
There's something else you have to see.

856
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:26,068
Fucking astounding.

857
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:29,541
Don't touch it.

858
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,983
It's properties of reproduction
and accelerated growth

859
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:34,986
are beyond anything I've encountered.

860
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,471
(laughing)

861
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:40,388
Indeedy, Nurse Hookah,
a veritable gold mine.

862
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,649
Where did you get it?

863
00:43:43,649 --> 00:43:44,521
Oh, out by the old

864
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,769
Hang tight, Al.

865
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:47,329
Gramps gets nothing from us,

866
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:49,333
not until he gives over something.

867
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,927
Oh, so now you think you
can bargain with me, huh?

868
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:53,923
With your frazzled little brain.

869
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,239
Settle down, beast.

870
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,035
We just think you got
something we can use.

871
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,187
Yeah?

872
00:43:59,187 --> 00:44:00,533
Like what?

873
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:03,200
The evil bong, the bitch bong.

874
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,404
How do you know I have her?

875
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:07,911
Don't snow me gramps,
I know you got her.

876
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,580
We left you down there
in the jungle with her

877
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,174
and no way you'd escape
without taking her with you.

878
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:16,248
Yes, I still owe you for
that ditching me down there.

879
00:44:16,248 --> 00:44:18,922
You puss oozing pecker.

880
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,593
Let's just call it even for all the crap

881
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:22,936
you dished out on me over the years.

882
00:44:22,936 --> 00:44:24,930
Right now, we're just
looking for a little trade.

883
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,431
Call it a loan.

884
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,551
I call it extortion.

885
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:30,576
I think this thing stinks
like a sumo wrestler's

886
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:33,576
just taken a dump on a burning tire.

887
00:44:37,116 --> 00:44:38,850
So where is she?

888
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,090
Who?

889
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,507
The bitch bong.

890
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:45,811
I have to go and get
her, she's in a safe place.

891
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:48,548
Yeah, I'll bet she's in a safe place.

892
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:52,081
(dramatic drumming)

893
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:53,414
Oh, very well.

894
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:02,087
(muffled mumbling)

895
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:03,914
There you go, pooky poo.

896
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:06,164
(mumbling)

897
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:09,218
There you are.

898
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,505
You trying to suffocate a girl?

899
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,565
Damn.

900
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:17,648
It's all in interest of
safety, you understand.

901
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:21,428
Safety, my ass.

902
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,639
Your safety, maybe, honky.

903
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,439
Tape on my mouth only pisses me off.

904
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:29,041
Can't keep a woman down like that.

905
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,708
Yes, you're right
sweetheart, I apologize.

906
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:37,909
That's bad gramps, Dick
Cheney on a goose hunt bad.

907
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:41,852
Ah, hell no, not those
crazy white boys again.

908
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:44,826
How many times you try to kill me already?

909
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,684
Uh, well, actually last time we all

910
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:49,244
defeated the king bong together,

911
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:50,856
if you remember correctly.

912
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:53,172
Oh, I remember alright.

913
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:57,316
Then you left me down in
that hot, sweaty jungle,

914
00:45:57,316 --> 00:46:01,239
all them bugs and spiders
crawling all over me.

915
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:02,072
Oh, lordy!

916
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,803
How do you plan to torture me
this time, you little shits?

917
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:10,346
No torture, just asking
for a little advice is all.

918
00:46:10,346 --> 00:46:11,237
Advice?

919
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:14,070
You mean, you want my help?

920
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,414
Well if you wanna put it that way.

921
00:46:17,414 --> 00:46:20,944
Wait a goddamn minute, what in the hell?

922
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,777
Oowee.

923
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:28,124
Now that is some kind
of sweet, sweet weed.

924
00:46:28,124 --> 00:46:30,178
Wouldn't you say Doctor?

925
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:33,978
Just what the doctor
ordered, sweetheart.

926
00:46:33,978 --> 00:46:36,375
Oh, we could do something
with this on the streets.

927
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:40,047
Uh, I mean, for medicinal
purposes of course.

928
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,380
Oh, of course.

929
00:46:42,328 --> 00:46:44,235
Wait a second, nobody's doing anything

930
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,055
until we get a little help
with our problem here.

931
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,595
What little problem is that?

932
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:49,428
Your dick?

933
00:46:49,428 --> 00:46:52,777
No, not his little mustard prick.

934
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:53,819
This.

935
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,569
(dramatic music)

936
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,327
It's from outer space.

937
00:47:02,327 --> 00:47:03,845
What you talking bout Willis?

938
00:47:03,845 --> 00:47:06,342
I mean this little problem
could be your little problem.

939
00:47:06,342 --> 00:47:08,269
Could be the whole world's little problem.

940
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:09,657
In simplest terms,

941
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:12,831
we believe an alien invasion may be afoot.

942
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,664
Yeah.

943
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,102
You dumb geeks have all done flipped.

944
00:47:16,102 --> 00:47:17,775
Maybe you could just
talk to it or something,

945
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:18,673
and just you know just.

946
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:19,719
Talk to it?

947
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:21,369
You dumb ass cracker, what am I?

948
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:23,325
Some side show act motherfucker?

949
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:25,827
Well, no, but I mean,

950
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:28,735
there aren't that many talking
bongs and I just thought.

951
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:30,309
There's only one of me,

952
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:33,522
and don't you let your lily
white ass every forget it.

953
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:35,689
But this one was
running his mouth earlier,

954
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:38,084
saying some really nasty stuff.

955
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:39,631
Insults that were totally uncalled for

956
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:41,668
and unprovoked, I might add.

957
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:42,596
This one?

958
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:43,556
Talking?

959
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:46,939
Shit, thing's nothing but a piece of junk.

960
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:49,744
Let's grab some of this super
weed and get out of here.

961
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,661
I concur, sweetheart.

962
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:56,349
You dare to refer to
me as a piece of junk?

963
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:57,797
My outward appearance is designed

964
00:47:57,797 --> 00:48:00,947
for me to blend better within
your rudimentary world.

965
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:03,346
To better fool your simple minds.

966
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:04,932
Who you calling simple, motherfucker?

967
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:07,245
You are nothing but trash
to be swept into the gutters

968
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:09,705
of what you call the ghetto of this world.

969
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:10,763
Say what?

970
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:14,187
Oh, let me at him, I'm gonna kill him.

971
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:16,824
Calm down now, sweetheart, take it easy.

972
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:18,910
We'll take care of this imposter

973
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,949
in due course, I assure you.

974
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:22,782
Well now.

975
00:48:24,061 --> 00:48:26,144
What do you guys propose?

976
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,090
Take it away.

977
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,909
Here's what we're thinking, gramps.

978
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:35,835
We want you to take a
toke from that thing.

979
00:48:35,835 --> 00:48:39,405
Do a little research, do a
little recon, report back to us.

980
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:40,448
(scoffing)

981
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:41,819
You're insane.

982
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:42,652
We need Eebee's help

983
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:45,041
to help get our friends
back, Bachman and Rabbit,

984
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,391
and to stop this invasion from happening.

985
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,592
[Alien Bong] You
think I cannot hear you?

986
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:51,228
Fools!

987
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,977
She's gotta know how to beat him.

988
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:54,817
I don't know nothing about that fucker.

989
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:55,920
Except he's an asshole.

990
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,814
You wanna get your hands
on some of that alien weed?

991
00:48:57,814 --> 00:48:59,432
Then you're gonna help us out.

992
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:01,754
Why the hell would I go in there?

993
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:02,895
We've got what you want pops,

994
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:06,014
and you're not getting
it until you help us out.

995
00:49:06,014 --> 00:49:07,764
Oh shit, damn strong.

996
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,149
Yeah, indeed she is.

997
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,482
Grown from the finest stock.

998
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,960
So, here's the new plan.

999
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,297
While I could get greedy over the weedy

1000
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:22,744
and take what I want,

1001
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:25,842
I have to admit that I
too am a little curious.

1002
00:49:25,842 --> 00:49:30,556
So, you guys are gonna go
into the dragon's lair,

1003
00:49:30,556 --> 00:49:33,859
on this recon that you speak of,

1004
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:36,371
and I'm gonna wait out
here and keep my eye out

1005
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:39,560
on this, uh, stupid friend of yours.

1006
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,140
Dudes don't do it.

1007
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,608
There's no way you can
trust this crank yanker.

1008
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,304
Let me assure you gentlemen,

1009
00:49:45,304 --> 00:49:48,227
that Nurse Hookah is well schooled

1010
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:51,060
in all aspects of the deadly arts.

1011
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:55,635
And she wouldn't hesitate
for one second to use them,

1012
00:49:55,635 --> 00:49:58,885
to extinguish yet another stupid dweeb.

1013
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:03,844
Another, you mean
she's done this before?

1014
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:05,029
(karate screaming)

1015
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:06,348
Not now, Larnell.

1016
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:08,388
Perhaps we should do as he demands.

1017
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:09,877
[Larnell] This ain't right, Al.

1018
00:50:09,877 --> 00:50:13,960
Agreed, but we have one
more demand of our own.

1019
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:17,176
And what might that be?

1020
00:50:17,176 --> 00:50:18,974
We need Eebee to go with us.

1021
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,123
Out of the question.

1022
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:23,000
No, she's necessary for
the success of this mission.

1023
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,167
Oh, hell no.

1024
00:50:25,184 --> 00:50:26,939
I wouldn't let them hurt you sweetheart,

1025
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:28,728
you know that, never.

1026
00:50:28,728 --> 00:50:30,492
Let's face it gramps, there
could be a whole lot more

1027
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:32,558
of this space weed where that came from.

1028
00:50:32,558 --> 00:50:35,081
Oh no you don't old man.

1029
00:50:35,081 --> 00:50:38,913
I know that look in your
eye when greed takes over.

1030
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,393
Just think of it Eebee.

1031
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:42,376
We could get what we wanted.

1032
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,820
An opportunity to take over the world

1033
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,236
with the greatest source
of grass known to man.

1034
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:52,999
Leading to the rise, the
unrivaled, unchecked rise

1035
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:56,416
to fame and fortune of the good Dr. Weed.

1036
00:50:58,915 --> 00:51:01,947
And you just gonna leave
me out on street, is that it?

1037
00:51:01,947 --> 00:51:05,550
Oh, no sweetheart,
no, no, no, no, never.

1038
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,716
Typical, honkey motherfucker.

1039
00:51:07,716 --> 00:51:10,751
You gonna dump me for this
white piece of ass ain't ya?

1040
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:14,918
No, no, no, no, Nurse
Hookah has certain attributes,

1041
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,950
but nothing to compare
with you sweetness, huh?

1042
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,033
(light hopeful tune)

1043
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,902
Sweetheart.

1044
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:29,626
(giggling)

1045
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:31,876
Oh man, they're so gross.

1046
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:36,388
Let's clip it along gramps,
make out sess is over.

1047
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,039
Let's do this thing.

1048
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:39,704
I'm gonna get you for this, hmm?

1049
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:40,997
Doctor Viagra.

1050
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,997
(psychedelic music)

1051
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,362
(choking)

1052
00:51:47,362 --> 00:51:50,112
(dramatic music)

1053
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:08,677
Man, this thing creeps me out.

1054
00:52:08,677 --> 00:52:12,155
It is only because your
simple mind cannot grasp

1055
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:14,357
the untold power before you.

1056
00:52:14,357 --> 00:52:16,774
Who are you calling simple?

1057
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:19,364
Excuse me, Junior,

1058
00:52:19,364 --> 00:52:22,188
I don't believe I gave you permission to.

1059
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:23,488
Fuck your permission, bro.

1060
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:24,894
We gotta get in there.

1061
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:28,919
Pardon me if I use my own stash
instead of that alien shit.

1062
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:31,379
Oh this thin, weak earthly
vegetation is an afront

1063
00:52:31,379 --> 00:52:34,153
to my senses, but do as you will.

1064
00:52:34,153 --> 00:52:36,403
Oh I will Tarzan, I will.

1065
00:52:39,462 --> 00:52:43,223
You offend me, you
disgust me, you repulse me.

1066
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:44,640
Take me you worm.

1067
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:51,560
This bong has issues, dude.

1068
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,870
Yes.

1069
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,571
(evil laughing)

1070
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:58,738
Humans are such easy prey.

1071
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:05,138
(screeching)

1072
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:08,305
(quick whipping tone)

1073
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:10,099
Whoa.

1074
00:53:11,051 --> 00:53:13,301
(laughing)

1075
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:15,792
Okay Al, your turn.

1076
00:53:18,671 --> 00:53:20,961
Come on Al, don't back out now.

1077
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:22,502
Oh, indeed, no.

1078
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:26,585
Friends need saving, plus
think of the discovery.

1079
00:53:27,717 --> 00:53:30,117
Whatever works for you, now suck it.

1080
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:31,534
Hmm, admirable.

1081
00:53:32,564 --> 00:53:34,564
Now join me in my world.

1082
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,900
(laughing)

1083
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,400
Let me blow your fragile mind.

1084
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:50,640
(quick whipping tone)

1085
00:53:52,723 --> 00:53:54,973
(laughing)

1086
00:54:00,039 --> 00:54:02,848
I hate to be the one to
break this to you Eebee,

1087
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:04,181
but you're next.

1088
00:54:05,218 --> 00:54:07,003
You're gonna get it,
you're gonna get it,

1089
00:54:07,003 --> 00:54:08,344
you're gonna get it!

1090
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:10,320
Silence, wench.

1091
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,912
Let me take you.

1092
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,086
Whoa, I feel like I went to an orgy,

1093
00:54:14,086 --> 00:54:16,586
but nobody gave me the butter.

1094
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,598
(laughing)

1095
00:54:21,598 --> 00:54:23,515
A new day has dawned.

1096
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:26,966
Soon our worlds will unite.

1097
00:54:26,966 --> 00:54:29,633
(chiming music)

1098
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:36,767
(screaming)

1099
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:43,547
(mechanical pulsing)

1100
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:46,678
Rabbit?

1101
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,518
They got me, man.

1102
00:54:51,518 --> 00:54:53,111
What's that noise, bro?

1103
00:54:53,111 --> 00:54:55,111
They got me hooked up.

1104
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:59,132
Oh, they're jizz milking you, Hoss.

1105
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,180
They want our seed, man.

1106
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,231
But this is some sick shit, bro.

1107
00:55:03,231 --> 00:55:04,809
You gotta get this off of me.

1108
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,648
I am not touching that thing.

1109
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:09,050
What if they're raising our babies

1110
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,300
to an army to invade Earth?

1111
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,395
That's a new one.

1112
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:18,002
Or maybe they're raising
our babies to eat them.

1113
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,842
They're cannibals.

1114
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:20,982
(sobbing)

1115
00:55:20,982 --> 00:55:23,232
Cannibals, oh the humanity!

1116
00:55:25,265 --> 00:55:28,348
Calm it down dude, where's Bachman?

1117
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:34,427
They got him, they got him so far out.

1118
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:35,576
Hang tight.

1119
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:36,697
(yelping)

1120
00:55:36,697 --> 00:55:38,106
Don't leave me, man.

1121
00:55:38,106 --> 00:55:39,086
(sobbing)

1122
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,669
No, don't leave me!

1123
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:46,148
You're not alone, talk to Jesus.

1124
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:46,981
BRB.

1125
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,467
(mumbling)

1126
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:53,111
(sobbing)

1127
00:55:53,111 --> 00:55:55,611
(eerie music)

1128
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:03,862
The alien world, or the
bong world if you will,

1129
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:07,686
seems to be comprised of
very little physical matter.

1130
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:11,353
In here, this fog, these
meager furnishings,

1131
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:18,014
seems to be contrived merely
to placate our human minds

1132
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:20,181
and possibly nothing else.

1133
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:26,152
Perhaps, in fact these images
have been taken from our minds

1134
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:28,354
to serve no purpose except basically

1135
00:56:28,354 --> 00:56:31,687
to give us illusion for our own benefit.

1136
00:56:34,051 --> 00:56:35,677
Thus far, I have seen no sign

1137
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:38,817
of Bachman, Larnell, or Rabbit.

1138
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:43,369
Nor have I seen any sign
of any alien beings.

1139
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:45,818
I have, although, discerned the sound

1140
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,552
of what can only be described as

1141
00:56:47,552 --> 00:56:50,299
some kind of mechanical device.

1142
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:51,132
Example.

1143
00:56:51,132 --> 00:56:53,913
(mechanical sucking)

1144
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:54,746
Hmm,

1145
00:56:56,275 --> 00:56:57,275
fascinating.

1146
00:56:59,406 --> 00:57:01,243
Moving on to investigate.

1147
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:03,743
(eerie music)

1148
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:10,408
There's most certainly
a machine at work here,

1149
00:57:10,408 --> 00:57:13,658
but I can't see anything in this foggy.

1150
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,969
(grunting)

1151
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:19,802
I seem to have tripped

1152
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:23,046
on some living organism.

1153
00:57:26,295 --> 00:57:29,763
There's fluid running through it,

1154
00:57:29,763 --> 00:57:33,722
the fluid is being transferred
from somewhere else

1155
00:57:33,722 --> 00:57:35,972
into a series of vast jugs.

1156
00:57:37,392 --> 00:57:39,792
What it is or for what purpose,

1157
00:57:39,792 --> 00:57:42,887
I cannot understand yet
without further observation.

1158
00:57:42,887 --> 00:57:45,970
(mechanical pulsing)

1159
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,505
(grunting)

1160
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,672
The smell is unpleasant and
pronounced, to say the least.

1161
00:58:02,597 --> 00:58:06,680
The viscosity is similar
to that of a consistency

1162
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:13,561
of a kind of material that
I, I'm not entirely sure of,

1163
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:16,728
but it's absolutely disgusting and it.

1164
00:58:19,483 --> 00:58:20,316
Oh, my.

1165
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:25,772
I seem to have encountered an alien being.

1166
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:29,605
Female, by all accounts,
voluptuous in nature,

1167
00:58:31,128 --> 00:58:32,314
with a physical attractiveness an

1168
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:35,222
average male might find appealing.

1169
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:37,198
Is this the alien's true form,

1170
00:58:37,198 --> 00:58:41,115
or has her imagery been
plucked from my memory?

1171
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:45,697
Although, I can't necessary
recall ever imagining

1172
00:58:45,697 --> 00:58:47,918
a naked woman with images painted on her

1173
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:50,292
as if the brush strokes had been applied

1174
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:52,292
by some of sexual tiger.

1175
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:55,970
(kissing)

1176
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,343
Oh my, the alien is amorous.

1177
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:03,560
(recorder breaking)

1178
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,576
Oh no, no, my field notes.

1179
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:06,783
Wait, wait, no.

1180
00:59:06,783 --> 00:59:09,283
Oh my god, please, please, no.

1181
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:13,086
(chiming music)

1182
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,836
(laughing)

1183
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:28,045
It seems your friend has
made a scientific discovery.

1184
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:28,980
(laughing)

1185
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,217
He is now one with the hive.

1186
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:33,448
The hive?

1187
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:35,056
What the fuck?

1188
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:36,304
Yeah, yeah, hive.

1189
00:59:36,304 --> 00:59:40,179
Don't you know what a hive is, simpleton?

1190
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:43,797
Yeah, it's like for bees and shit.

1191
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,104
(laughing)

1192
00:59:45,104 --> 00:59:47,249
Bees and shit.

1193
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:51,492
And all the insects, all
the insects of the earth.

1194
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,825
Insects meaning humans, huh?

1195
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:57,494
Am I correct?

1196
00:59:57,494 --> 01:00:00,631
Rudimentary, but accurate.

1197
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:01,915
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1198
01:00:01,915 --> 01:00:04,165
(laughing)

1199
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,895
You mean to assimilate us, hm?

1200
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:13,058
Not necessarily invade and destroy us.

1201
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,970
Oh, uh, perhaps.

1202
01:00:16,895 --> 01:00:20,361
You want to live among us,
share our world with us, eh?

1203
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:22,111
Not rule over us, hm?

1204
01:00:23,242 --> 01:00:25,242
That is one concept, yes.

1205
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:27,413
(laughing)

1206
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:28,663
You see, boy?

1207
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,049
You've been worried over nothing.

1208
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,214
(laughing)

1209
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,177
How much of your weed you been smoking,

1210
01:00:36,177 --> 01:00:38,158
you stupid sag bag?

1211
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:40,868
This bong is snowing you.

1212
01:00:40,868 --> 01:00:44,400
I think I'm old enough to
be able to discern deception.

1213
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,114
(laughing)

1214
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:50,197
Even though my faculties
may be slightly impaired

1215
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:54,804
because of certain hallucinatory elements.

1216
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:57,054
(laughing)

1217
01:01:02,077 --> 01:01:03,967
Anybody got any pizza?

1218
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:06,217
(laughing)

1219
01:01:07,422 --> 01:01:09,793
Man, you better not be
smoking that super grass

1220
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,446
that's growing on the counter.

1221
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:13,118
You don't know what
that shit'll do to you.

1222
01:01:13,118 --> 01:01:16,298
Don't make me out a fool, boy.

1223
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:19,189
Well you haven't been playing
this one too smart so far.

1224
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:20,788
As far as I can tell you're playing

1225
01:01:20,788 --> 01:01:25,157
right in to this helium bot's
hands, or hoses, or whatever.

1226
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,407
(laughing)

1227
01:01:28,486 --> 01:01:30,986
I have it all under control.

1228
01:01:31,926 --> 01:01:33,740
(laughing)

1229
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,012
Shit, Larnell was right.

1230
01:01:35,012 --> 01:01:37,159
These aliens are gonna
totally work us over.

1231
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:39,409
(laughing)

1232
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:45,530
(moaning)

1233
01:01:46,496 --> 01:01:49,579
(mechanical pulsing)

1234
01:02:06,262 --> 01:02:07,526
Bachman?

1235
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:08,359
Dude.

1236
01:02:09,428 --> 01:02:11,871
Bach, what the hell?

1237
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:14,997
I've been probed, in my dong.

1238
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:15,997
I knew it.

1239
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:18,697
Hold up white boy.
(yelping)

1240
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,351
You don't wanna be touching that shit.

1241
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:21,352
But I gotta help him?

1242
01:02:21,352 --> 01:02:22,363
How?

1243
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:25,141
Decorate your garden, use him for mulch?

1244
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,193
Listen, bitch, if you're not gonna

1245
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:28,305
be constructive then zip it, alright?

1246
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,417
Just tryin to help.

1247
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,816
Well if you wanna help then
tell me what's happening here.

1248
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,066
Dude, they sucked me dry.

1249
01:02:38,072 --> 01:02:41,105
He's right, this boy's seed is history.

1250
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:44,542
His meat flute ain't
playing no more tunes, baby.

1251
01:02:44,542 --> 01:02:46,625
My wacker's toast, bro.

1252
01:02:49,339 --> 01:02:54,080
Just hang on, B, I'm gonna
think of something okay?

1253
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,448
Eebee, how about some suggestions?

1254
01:02:56,448 --> 01:02:59,650
Oh ho, so now you wanna
hear from me, is that it?

1255
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,737
Done keeping a good woman down?

1256
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,601
I'm sorry for snapping, okay?

1257
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:04,985
Oppressive cracker.

1258
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:06,835
How about some ideas here, Eebee?

1259
01:03:06,835 --> 01:03:09,046
Ideas wouldn't be a bad thing.

1260
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:09,879
I wouldn't mind getting out

1261
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:12,207
of here while the getting's good.

1262
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:13,086
So?

1263
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:14,664
Okay, look numb nuts.

1264
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:17,091
These aliens want some human seed.

1265
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:19,684
Don't know why, and I don't care.

1266
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:21,801
My guess is they're raising a bunch

1267
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:25,276
of imitation humans to help invade Earth.

1268
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:28,051
Yeah, kinda like in Invasion
of the Body Snatchers?

1269
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:29,051
With weed.

1270
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,084
(yelping)

1271
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:34,251
(gasping)

1272
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,233
Aw, shit monkey.

1273
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:42,351
Just hang tight there, B.

1274
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,518
I'll get you out, somehow.

1275
01:03:46,087 --> 01:03:47,223
Watch my boy, Eebee.

1276
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,223
Oh yeah, I'll do that.

1277
01:03:52,585 --> 01:03:53,418
Idiot.

1278
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,413
(static)

1279
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:01,935
(mechanical pulsing)

1280
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:04,185
(groaning)

1281
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:09,171
Al?

1282
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:12,263
(groaning)

1283
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:18,171
Oh, they got you by the groin, man.

1284
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:20,588
Larnell, you gotta help me.

1285
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:25,234
I don't want them taking my essence.

1286
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:27,496
I totally get it, man,
that is some menses splooge.

1287
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:29,760
Valuable shit on the black market.

1288
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,677
It just amounts to such
an extreme violation.

1289
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,163
(groaning)

1290
01:04:45,834 --> 01:04:47,952
Oh, it sounds as if another

1291
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,696
has been brought into the folds.

1292
01:04:49,696 --> 01:04:51,946
(laughing)

1293
01:04:54,414 --> 01:04:57,663
I don't know what you're
smiling about old man.

1294
01:04:57,663 --> 01:05:00,830
It's very simple, you ignoramus, eh.

1295
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:04,474
The aliens have their intentions set

1296
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:07,807
on taking over the world, and I for one,

1297
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:13,474
have no fear because
they are going to need

1298
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:17,557
humans of higher learning
to give them assistance

1299
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,850
in maintaining the earth
at a functioning level.

1300
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,359
(laughing)

1301
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,230
And you think that's gonna be you?

1302
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:27,837
I know it's gonna be me.

1303
01:05:27,837 --> 01:05:30,087
(laughing)

1304
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:34,787
Isn't that so, Mr. Alien Bong?

1305
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,640
Why of course it is.

1306
01:05:41,227 --> 01:05:44,463
You're an idiot, you dirty old hippy.

1307
01:05:44,463 --> 01:05:46,427
(gasping)

1308
01:05:46,427 --> 01:05:47,832
No!

1309
01:05:47,832 --> 01:05:50,793
Nurse, nurse, Nurse Hookah.

1310
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:51,626
Oh, my.

1311
01:05:52,553 --> 01:05:54,463
Oh dear, oh dear.

1312
01:05:54,463 --> 01:05:57,929
Damn, she's got a hard noggin.

1313
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:58,762
Stop!

1314
01:05:59,635 --> 01:06:00,925
What the fuck?

1315
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:02,331
It's time to take it out.

1316
01:06:02,331 --> 01:06:04,204
And you think that's
the best thing to do?

1317
01:06:04,204 --> 01:06:05,037
Fucking this thing up's

1318
01:06:05,037 --> 01:06:07,144
the best idea I've had in a long time.

1319
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:11,311
Then how are you gonna get
in there and help your friends?

1320
01:06:12,566 --> 01:06:13,898
Okay, maybe you've got a good point.

1321
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:17,761
Wise decision, though
ultimately doomed for failure.

1322
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:19,287
We'll see about that.

1323
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,787
(eerie music)

1324
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:30,030
Yes, put your lips on
that you pathetic maggot.

1325
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,237
(water bubbling)

1326
01:06:32,237 --> 01:06:34,487
(laughing)

1327
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:41,952
(quick whipping tune)

1328
01:06:47,911 --> 01:06:51,239
Buy a kingdom for a hard on.

1329
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:52,746
Hello?

1330
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:54,913
Can you, well, I am spent.

1331
01:06:57,576 --> 01:07:00,500
There's way no two ways about it, I am.

1332
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,333
Rabbit.

1333
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:04,660
Dude you look like shit.

1334
01:07:06,113 --> 01:07:07,995
What happened?

1335
01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:10,162
Those alien bong chicks.

1336
01:07:11,346 --> 01:07:12,384
They attacked me.

1337
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:15,115
Dude, you didn't learn
anything from last time?

1338
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,330
With the poontang?

1339
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,787
Poontang.

1340
01:07:18,787 --> 01:07:21,088
You gotta abstain.

1341
01:07:21,088 --> 01:07:23,421
Restrain, resist temptation.

1342
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:27,012
Come on you idiot.

1343
01:07:27,012 --> 01:07:29,762
(dramatic music)

1344
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,037
(moaning)

1345
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:42,371
What the hell?

1346
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:46,210
Bachman?

1347
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:49,043
Bro, things ain't going so good.

1348
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:51,611
No, not so good.

1349
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,505
(moaning)

1350
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:02,858
You're a fucking Chia Pet.

1351
01:08:02,858 --> 01:08:04,191
Ch-ch-ch Chia.

1352
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,553
You got screwed.

1353
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:08,386
No shit.

1354
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:12,969
You gotta get this stuff off of me, bro.

1355
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:16,274
Uh-uh, dude, I'm out of here.

1356
01:08:16,274 --> 01:08:17,555
Rabbit.

1357
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:19,555
Don't be a pussy, man.

1358
01:08:21,835 --> 01:08:23,999
(laughing)

1359
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:24,832
Rabbit.

1360
01:08:26,389 --> 01:08:27,222
Come on.

1361
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:29,731
Guys, come on man.

1362
01:08:32,745 --> 01:08:35,093
(mechanical pulsing)

1363
01:08:35,093 --> 01:08:37,343
(groaning)

1364
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:41,159
Holy shit, it's Al.

1365
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,909
(dramatic music)

1366
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:55,560
What do you think this thing is?

1367
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,519
Some kind of alien weapon or something?

1368
01:08:57,519 --> 01:08:59,686
Uh-uh, Brett, uh, Brett.

1369
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:03,495
I'm gonna take these cock knockers out.

1370
01:09:03,495 --> 01:09:04,336
(yelling)
Brett I wouldn't do.

1371
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:05,977
(shattering)

1372
01:09:05,977 --> 01:09:08,144
(yelling)

1373
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:15,440
That has some of those boys down.

1374
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,375
Brother, I hate to break this to you,

1375
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:19,679
but you do not want to know what that is

1376
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,428
you got all over you.

1377
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:22,924
What?

1378
01:09:22,924 --> 01:09:23,757
Jizz.

1379
01:09:25,924 --> 01:09:28,174
Oh sick, sick fuck, fuck.

1380
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:32,769
Hey, it's not so bad, it's not so bad.

1381
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:35,727
It's just a little of mine,
and a little of Bachman's.

1382
01:09:35,727 --> 01:09:37,637
That's my semen.

1383
01:09:37,637 --> 01:09:39,970
(screaming)

1384
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:45,362
Dudes.

1385
01:09:45,362 --> 01:09:47,400
Bro, look at this shit.

1386
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,051
You got space wank all over you babe.

1387
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:53,668
What's happening to Al?

1388
01:09:53,668 --> 01:09:54,857
They still got him hooked up,

1389
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,814
they're milking him pretty good, too.

1390
01:09:56,814 --> 01:09:58,158
(groaning)

1391
01:09:58,158 --> 01:09:59,505
(zapping)

1392
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:03,170
Mmhmm, they want that smart jizz.

1393
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:04,453
That's what they want.

1394
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:06,358
They're thinking they can
take over the world faster

1395
01:10:06,358 --> 01:10:08,684
with smarts than with stupid.

1396
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:10,013
Gotta stop them.

1397
01:10:10,013 --> 01:10:13,902
I think what she's referring
to is that our manhoods

1398
01:10:13,902 --> 01:10:17,377
is lacking in certain
intellectual properties.

1399
01:10:17,377 --> 01:10:19,934
Oh who gives a fuck,
let's just get out of here?

1400
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:22,577
What about brother Al?

1401
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:24,827
I've never felt so alive.

1402
01:10:26,549 --> 01:10:28,649
I'm in so much pain.

1403
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:29,649
It's cosmic.

1404
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:31,849
Hold my bone.

1405
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,841
Be strong for me, Al, this
might sting a little bit.

1406
01:10:37,841 --> 01:10:39,127
(groaning)

1407
01:10:39,127 --> 01:10:39,960
Ow.

1408
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,923
(mumbled whispering)

1409
01:10:41,923 --> 01:10:44,840
(karate screaming)

1410
01:10:50,886 --> 01:10:55,158
I normally don't hit a
lady, but you ain't no ladies.

1411
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:57,086
Your joint, sir.

1412
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,419
That was monkey.

1413
01:11:00,361 --> 01:11:02,694
Uh, it was drunken monkey.

1414
01:11:03,618 --> 01:11:04,868
Right on, Al.

1415
01:11:05,947 --> 01:11:07,348
Look at me, Al.

1416
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:08,515
On three, one.

1417
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:10,540
(screaming)

1418
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,865
Oh god.

1419
01:11:11,865 --> 01:11:14,115
(groaning)

1420
01:11:23,681 --> 01:11:26,045
Now let's get that alien bong.

1421
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:28,503
And just how do you propose
we do that, spunky monkey?

1422
01:11:28,503 --> 01:11:30,019
We're here in god knows where

1423
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,154
and that thing's back in the head shop.

1424
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,959
I got an idea, I got an idea.

1425
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:36,205
What you got, Eebee?

1426
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:39,801
We gotta cause us a chain reaction.

1427
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:40,634
Wait, wait, wait.

1428
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:42,117
I think she has something here.

1429
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:43,949
I mean the effect of the bong, you know,

1430
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:45,754
reaches between both worlds.

1431
01:11:45,754 --> 01:11:48,263
Maybe somehow we can reverse the process.

1432
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:50,259
Yeah, but how?

1433
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:53,463
Well, I figure we need
a really strong catalyst,

1434
01:11:53,463 --> 01:11:56,654
you know something to
jump start the process.

1435
01:11:56,654 --> 01:11:58,293
What did you have in mind?

1436
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:00,876
(smooth music)

1437
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,204
Yeah, yeah.

1438
01:12:06,204 --> 01:12:07,371
Yes, yes, yes!

1439
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,891
What?

1440
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,816
You could be the catalyst.

1441
01:12:12,816 --> 01:12:14,064
Catalyst?

1442
01:12:14,064 --> 01:12:15,197
The conduit.

1443
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,405
That right, Al?

1444
01:12:16,405 --> 01:12:17,586
Correct.

1445
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:18,472
(laughing)

1446
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:21,337
Hey, you're the walrus.

1447
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,424
Coo coo ca choo.

1448
01:12:23,424 --> 01:12:26,424
(psychedelic music)

1449
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,297
(karate screaming)

1450
01:12:36,455 --> 01:12:38,788
(muttering)

1451
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,586
Alright boys, let's fire this puppy up.

1452
01:13:03,586 --> 01:13:05,168
Huh?

1453
01:13:05,168 --> 01:13:07,085
No way, no, no, no, no.

1454
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:11,703
Yes way, play like a
champion for me Bach.

1455
01:13:11,703 --> 01:13:13,916
No, no, no, no, no.

1456
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:16,083
(blowing)

1457
01:13:19,023 --> 01:13:20,271
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

1458
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:21,950
Total team player dude.

1459
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,200
(groaning)

1460
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,165
It's hot, hot.

1461
01:13:31,165 --> 01:13:31,998
Sucks.

1462
01:13:37,022 --> 01:13:40,022
(high pitched tone)

1463
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,509
(chiming)

1464
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:59,312
(moaning)

1465
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:06,228
No, no!

1466
01:14:07,678 --> 01:14:09,011
My female units!

1467
01:14:10,455 --> 01:14:11,723
My force!

1468
01:14:11,723 --> 01:14:13,118
What's the matter?

1469
01:14:13,118 --> 01:14:14,784
Those worms, those bugs.

1470
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,784
They're using my weapons against me.

1471
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:22,321
Those scum, those insignificant parasites.

1472
01:14:22,321 --> 01:14:24,017
Yes, yes, I've been saying

1473
01:14:24,017 --> 01:14:27,576
the same thing myself for years now.

1474
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:30,909
Especially in the case of these cretins.

1475
01:14:32,378 --> 01:14:36,128
Extremely difficult to
exterminate parasites.

1476
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:38,884
[Alien Bong] No!

1477
01:14:41,197 --> 01:14:43,232
(scoffing)

1478
01:14:43,232 --> 01:14:45,732
(eerie music)

1479
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:48,577
Now it's time we send

1480
01:14:48,577 --> 01:14:51,920
a message to the man, the bong in charge.

1481
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,984
Dude, give me the honors.

1482
01:14:54,984 --> 01:14:56,997
Dude, you wanna toke yourself?

1483
01:14:56,997 --> 01:14:59,914
If you want something done right.

1484
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:03,086
That's right, light it up.

1485
01:15:04,428 --> 01:15:05,511
Lean on over.

1486
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:12,669
(groaning)

1487
01:15:13,896 --> 01:15:16,646
Give me a doobie, doobie, doobie.

1488
01:15:17,662 --> 01:15:19,412
Take your medicine.

1489
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,029
[Brett] Suck Bach.

1490
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:23,943
With any luck.

1491
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:27,026
(mechanical pulsing)

1492
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,197
(coughing)

1493
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:35,947
(dramatic tones)

1494
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:48,098
No, no, no!

1495
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,717
(electric pulsing)

1496
01:15:55,374 --> 01:15:57,707
(explosion)

1497
01:16:01,444 --> 01:16:03,944
That could have gone better.

1498
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:10,612
(electric pulsing)

1499
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:14,697
(explosion)

1500
01:16:14,697 --> 01:16:17,030
(screaming)

1501
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:23,434
[Bachman] Some pussy landed in my face.

1502
01:16:23,434 --> 01:16:24,749
Praise the Lord.

1503
01:16:24,749 --> 01:16:26,932
Well, looks like you did it again,

1504
01:16:26,932 --> 01:16:29,233
you stupid mother fuckers.

1505
01:16:29,233 --> 01:16:30,233
We did it.

1506
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:35,323
Once again, I gotta thank
what's in the good book.

1507
01:16:37,297 --> 01:16:40,297
(psychedelic tones)

1508
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:47,891
Dude, I needed that shower.

1509
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:50,697
My clothes got pretty jizzy.

1510
01:16:50,697 --> 01:16:52,332
Well I for one could
go the rest of my life

1511
01:16:52,332 --> 01:16:54,431
without another alien invasion.

1512
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:57,092
The one spot I gotta agree with you.

1513
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:58,925
We might not have any choice, dudes.

1514
01:16:58,925 --> 01:17:01,063
Those Area 51 aliens are gonna get out,

1515
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:04,230
no joke, and they are gonna be pissed.

1516
01:17:05,442 --> 01:17:06,599
I think that conspiracy theory

1517
01:17:06,599 --> 01:17:10,070
has run its particular course, Larnell.

1518
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,720
Not at all, Al.

1519
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,543
How do you think you'd feel
if you'd been force fed

1520
01:17:13,543 --> 01:17:15,873
malt balls for the past 60 years?

1521
01:17:15,873 --> 01:17:17,910
Fat asses won't be able
to get out of their own way,

1522
01:17:17,910 --> 01:17:20,494
let alone be any threat to us.

1523
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:22,028
Amen to that, brothers.

1524
01:17:22,028 --> 01:17:25,410
(video game dinging)

1525
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:27,439
Shit, it's Luann.

1526
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,834
What about the restraining order?

1527
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,051
Think she cares about that?

1528
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:31,367
Chick's obsessed.

1529
01:17:31,367 --> 01:17:34,450
(video game beeping)

1530
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:42,312
These are for you, my sexy flower.

1531
01:17:46,278 --> 01:17:48,254
(farting)

1532
01:17:48,254 --> 01:17:51,337
Sorry, I got angry ass again today.

1533
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:54,546
(sniffing)

1534
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,546
(soft upbeat music)

1535
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,439
I want you now.

1536
01:18:01,296 --> 01:18:02,610
Stud.

1537
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:05,110
(reggae beat)

1538
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:12,711
What?

1539
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:15,294
It's been a bit of a dry spell.

1540
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:20,411
Get 'em, champ.

1541
01:18:23,515 --> 01:18:25,259
Hey, at least he has somebody.

1542
01:18:25,259 --> 01:18:27,437
Wish I could run into Velicity again.

1543
01:18:27,437 --> 01:18:28,465
You ought to look her up when

1544
01:18:28,465 --> 01:18:32,215
you're in the neighborhood,
of South America.

1545
01:18:33,907 --> 01:18:37,718
[Bachman] You guys smell something?

1546
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:39,635
Somebody order pizza?

1547
01:18:42,358 --> 01:18:43,275
Velicity?

1548
01:18:45,145 --> 01:18:46,571
What are you doing here?

1549
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:48,137
Oh, would you rather I go?

1550
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:49,533
Fuck no.

1551
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:51,859
I mean, of course not.

1552
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,893
Well don't just stand
there like an idiot.

1553
01:18:53,893 --> 01:18:56,476
(upbeat music)

1554
01:19:02,908 --> 01:19:05,032
Man, I have missed you a ton.

1555
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,926
Been dating the five sisters
on Palm Street every night.

1556
01:19:07,926 --> 01:19:08,759
(laughing)

1557
01:19:08,759 --> 01:19:10,365
But seriously, what are you doing here?

1558
01:19:10,365 --> 01:19:13,542
Well, when your grandfather
disappeared in South America,

1559
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:15,396
so did my pay checks.

1560
01:19:15,396 --> 01:19:16,616
He was paying me after all,

1561
01:19:16,616 --> 01:19:20,491
so I decided I could
use a change of scenery.

1562
01:19:20,491 --> 01:19:24,971
So I left one jungle for
another, and here I am.

1563
01:19:24,971 --> 01:19:26,339
That's great.

1564
01:19:26,339 --> 01:19:28,389
How long you plan on staying?

1565
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,639
Well, that sorta depends.

1566
01:19:31,912 --> 01:19:33,853
Depends on what?

1567
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:36,436
(upbeat music)

1568
01:19:40,831 --> 01:19:43,471
I imagine you're gonna be
staying for quite a while, then.

1569
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:46,054
(upbeat music)

1570
01:19:57,153 --> 01:19:58,986
Brett, what's wrong?

1571
01:20:00,889 --> 01:20:02,722
I am so ready for you.

1572
01:20:05,456 --> 01:20:07,421
I'm not sure I can do this anymore.

1573
01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:10,088
What do you mean, snuggle bug?

1574
01:20:12,902 --> 01:20:16,985
Well, you made me feel
bad about myself before.

1575
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:21,393
I thought you like me for who I am.

1576
01:20:21,393 --> 01:20:22,226
Oh.

1577
01:20:23,683 --> 01:20:26,850
I love you for who you are, hot stuff.

1578
01:20:28,631 --> 01:20:29,881
You are so hot.

1579
01:20:31,556 --> 01:20:32,389
Stuff.

1580
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:36,487
That's just the point.

1581
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:39,040
You know, I like who I am now too.

1582
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,210
But you were repulsed by me
when I was a little bigger.

1583
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:46,533
I'm still the same guy on the inside.

1584
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:50,450
Oh you are so cute with
your little emotions.

1585
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:55,858
Oh, those days are gone, right hunky?

1586
01:20:58,003 --> 01:21:00,014
And this is now.

1587
01:21:00,014 --> 01:21:01,847
And I want you so bad.

1588
01:21:03,881 --> 01:21:06,464
(upbeat music)

1589
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:11,092
I guess you're right,
I'm just being silly.

1590
01:21:11,092 --> 01:21:12,509
Of course I am.

1591
01:21:14,576 --> 01:21:16,326
So show me the goods,

1592
01:21:17,742 --> 01:21:18,575
beef cake.

1593
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:21,539
It's a pleasure.

1594
01:21:24,628 --> 01:21:26,961
(screaming)

1595
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:30,750
(horror music)

1596
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,495
What's wrong, baby cakes?

1597
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:36,212
What about grandpa?

1598
01:21:36,212 --> 01:21:38,915
Gramps, we forgot him.

1599
01:21:38,915 --> 01:21:41,415
(eerie music)

1600
01:21:46,664 --> 01:21:49,331
(playful music)

1601
01:21:53,637 --> 01:21:56,826
There we have it, Nurse Hookah.

1602
01:21:56,826 --> 01:21:57,909
Gaze upon it.

1603
01:22:00,574 --> 01:22:01,491
What is it?

1604
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,835
It's very simple.

1605
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:06,924
Destiny!

1606
01:22:08,271 --> 01:22:10,508
(laughing)

1607
01:22:10,508 --> 01:22:13,341
(uplifting music)

1608
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:24,446
♫ I think God smokes weed

1609
01:22:24,446 --> 01:22:28,571
♫ And he was high when he made me

1610
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:32,071
♫ I can feel it in my DNA

1611
01:22:35,269 --> 01:22:38,001
♫ I think God smokes weed

1612
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:42,350
♫ And he was high when he made me

1613
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:46,145
♫ And I think he gave up halfway

1614
01:22:46,145 --> 01:22:48,645
(reggae beat)

1615
01:23:02,037 --> 01:23:04,965
♫ Boy I was complete as I understand

1616
01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:08,353
♫ God was making a mess
of the man he planned

1617
01:23:08,353 --> 01:23:09,576
♫ In the face of defeat,

1618
01:23:09,576 --> 01:23:11,594
♫ He smoked a helping hand

1619
01:23:11,594 --> 01:23:15,188
♫ And said I'll just
put him in a reggae band

1620
01:23:15,188 --> 01:23:18,240
♫ I feel it in the beat
when I'm on the stand

1621
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,608
♫ Feel it in my feet when I'm on the sand

1622
01:23:21,608 --> 01:23:24,784
♫ I see it in the
sunsets that might expand

1623
01:23:24,784 --> 01:23:28,287
♫ Into your mind so you'll understand

1624
01:23:28,287 --> 01:23:31,290
♫ I think God smokes weed

1625
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:35,581
♫ And he was high when he made me

1626
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:39,081
♫ I can feel it in my DNA

1627
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:44,680
♫ I think God smokes weed

1628
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,977
♫ And he was high when he made me

1629
01:23:48,977 --> 01:23:51,996
♫ And I think he gave up halfway

1630
01:23:51,996 --> 01:23:54,496
(reggae beat)

1631
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:11,476
♫ Back in Catholic school till my memory

1632
01:24:11,476 --> 01:24:14,800
♫ It made me a feel a
fool through humility

1633
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,231
♫ It said that God's
available consistently

1634
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:21,838
♫ Except for the one time
you dropped that seed

1635
01:24:21,838 --> 01:24:24,963
♫ I hear that God's in
you and me and all we see

1636
01:24:24,963 --> 01:24:28,323
♫ Assuming all the actions of my own body

1637
01:24:28,323 --> 01:24:31,605
♫ If that's the way it
is then you must agree,

1638
01:24:31,605 --> 01:24:35,251
♫ Every time we rock the ganj so does he

1639
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:38,011
♫ I think God smokes weed

1640
01:24:38,011 --> 01:24:42,298
♫ And he was high when he made me

1641
01:24:42,298 --> 01:24:45,798
♫ I can feel it in my DNA

1642
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:51,350
♫ I think God smokes weed

1643
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:55,484
♫ And he was high when he made me

1644
01:24:55,484 --> 01:24:58,942
♫ And I think he gave up halfway ♫

1645
01:24:58,942 --> 01:25:01,442
(reggae beat)
