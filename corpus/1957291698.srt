1
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,867
What?

2
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:08,926
Thank you.

3
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,566
- Hey, are you okay?

4
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,880
Not cool.

5
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,410
- I told you I can cry on command.

6
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,850
It's not funny.

7
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,120
- It's kind of funny.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,170
- All right, let's go.

9
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,323
Okay, fine.

10
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,839
of control in everyone

11
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,903
So wait.

12
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,800
So this is not your childhood home though.

13
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,633
No.

14
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:30,486
No, that's like two miles out from here.

15
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,063
So kind of close.

16
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,310
Wow.

17
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,310
Oh my god, it looks.

18
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,363
Pretty.

19
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:38,480
It's in pretty good shape.

20
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,730
Potholes.

21
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,137
I'm kidding.

22
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:45,060
I should tell them that.

23
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,930
Yeah, it could
really ruin people's tires,

24
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,010
which is out of consideration for guests.

25
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,390
Should tell them out.

26
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,780
They love feedback.

27
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,930
Hello, nice to meet you.

28
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,890
I am dating your sister.

29
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,830
I hate your roads.

30
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,663
Yeah.

31
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:58,880
Yeah, that's great.

32
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,713
That's perfect.

33
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,000
They will.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,100
That will be the moment that they just

35
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,857
all fall in love with you
'cause I know they're going to

36
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:06,857
and it's just like inevitable,
but that would be the moment.

37
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:16,535
You ready?

38
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:17,690
- I'm nervous.

39
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,609
Oh no.

40
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:19,442
Oh my god.

41
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,383
- Welcome home.

42
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:26,999
- Is that good for you?

43
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,420
You guys are animals.

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,253
Yeah, you're disgusting.

45
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:30,086
Hi, Ada.

46
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:31,083
- Ada?

47
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,420
I'm Ozzie.

48
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,593
It's safe, I promise.

49
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,699
Oh my god.

50
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:41,698
- How'd you like our greeting?

51
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,115
- Right this way.

52
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:44,822
Hi, Oz.

53
00:04:44,822 --> 00:04:46,044
- Hey.

54
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,164
I love you.

55
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:47,997
Oh my gosh.

56
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:48,830
Hi.

57
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,663
- Hi.
- You saw my butt.

58
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:50,496
- I did.

59
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,329
Give her some space.

60
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,162
- Okay, sorry.

61
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:52,995
Wait, I don't know where it is.

62
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:53,828
- Where did the ball go?

63
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:55,400
Long drive?

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,600
Not long enough after that.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,330
- Like I want more drive.

66
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,560
Coffee?

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,963
- Yes, please.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,540
- Well, you got it.

69
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,920
Thank you.

70
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,753
- Let's see.

71
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:08,958
We got.

72
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,239
Oh, we used to have the.

73
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:15,060
Well, we got instant coffee,
which is awful and terrible.

74
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,900
Or we have the Guatemalan blend.

75
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,850
- Guatemalan it is.

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,663
So.

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,773
Let's see.

78
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,858
Are you from Chicago originally?

79
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,595
- I'm actually from Milwaukee.

80
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,810
I'm from Milwaukee.

81
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,440
- Milwaukee, yeah.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
I heard they have a nice art museum.

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,873
Never been.

84
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:38,513
Maybe someday I'll spend more
than a couple hours there.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
Hm.

86
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,820
They have cheese, yeah.

87
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,467
- Yeah, we've got cheese in Milwaukee.

88
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,300
- Oh no.

89
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,133
Are you okay?

90
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,410
What's going on?

91
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,940
- Oh, I was just.

92
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,490
I just thought we were
like being really loud.

93
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,323
Isn't that what we're doing?

94
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:55,886
Like being really loud.

95
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:58,626
Okay, yeah, no.

96
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,459
That's good.

97
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,296
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:02,746
That was obnoxious.

99
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,423
It's really quiet here.

100
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,126
Sit.

101
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:08,959
Sh.

102
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:10,646
Sit.

103
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,860
Nice.

104
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Let's see.

105
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,098
They didn't get the quiet memo.

106
00:06:16,098 --> 00:06:17,375
Okay.

107
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,208
So.

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,853
Why haven't we met you yet?

109
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,693
- Marissa just never really like.

110
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:32,253
I don't know.

111
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:38,763
- Were you serious the whole time?

112
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:39,596
- What?

113
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,013
- Together the whole time exclusive.

114
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,484
Ah.

115
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:51,530
- Yeah, it was pretty real right away.

116
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,890
- Good.

117
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,723
Nice.

118
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:58,512
Well, we're glad that it's
finally happening meeting you.

119
00:06:58,512 --> 00:06:59,345
Me too.

120
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,178
- Welcome.

121
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,846
- Oh my god, look at this place.

122
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,905
Oh my god, I love it.

123
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:05,670
Oh my god, it's so amazing.

124
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,990
It's so good.

125
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,615
- Stop screaming.

126
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:12,363
Gentlemen live here.

127
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,390
Haven't you ever heard of inside voices?

128
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,223
- No.

129
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,770
Oz, why in the fucking fuck

130
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,124
did you buy your
ex-girlfriend's grandma's house?

131
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:20,600
It was for sale.

132
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,433
- Yeah, okay.

133
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:22,270
It's still kinda creepy though.

134
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,310
- Okay, it's not creepy.

135
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,560
She begged me to buy it.

136
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,510
And basically some say I'm a hero.

137
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,951
- Does the hero feed the chickens?

138
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,700
- Oh, he tries, but they don't
let him close to the coop.

139
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,346
- Of course.

140
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,550
- We tried sneaking in last
week to grab some eggs.

141
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,500
Yeah, didn't work.

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,490
- Oh, check this out.

143
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,530
- What the fuck?

144
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,363
- Yeah.

145
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,894
- You guys, take care of this.

146
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,120
- Okay, look.

147
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,980
Speaking of taking care of,

148
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,640
why don't you take these ladies upstairs?

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,470
Take care of their bags like a gentleman.

150
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,974
I'm not your
squire, but I'll take these.

151
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,368
- No, no, no.

152
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,951
- Like a gentleman.

153
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,846
Where were ya?

154
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,210
I was behind you.

155
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,750
Excuses, excuses.

156
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,380
Oh okay.

157
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,420
- This is mine.

158
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,440
- Yeah, obviously.

159
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,372
- Ada, do you snore at all?

160
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:11,580
You better not.

161
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,646
- Be nice.

162
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,380
I'm just joking, dude.

163
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,213
- Okay.

164
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,823
Okay, fine.

165
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:18,656
- Okay bye.

166
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:19,739
Bye.

167
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,998
- Bunk beds for a reason?

168
00:08:24,998 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't know.

169
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Brothers or whatever, right?

170
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,793
- Right.

171
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,430
I'm doing okay.

172
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,980
Like, I'm doing well with them.

173
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,270
Yeah, totally.

174
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,963
You're doing great.

175
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:38,796
Like A plus.

176
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:39,629
Nine out of 10.

177
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:40,520
- Oh, nine out of 10.

178
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,950
That's all.

179
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,783
Good.

180
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,093
Honestly,
it's a pretty good bed.

181
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,050
- Oh, you get bottom bunk?

182
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,950
Yeah.

183
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,763
Hope this doesn't crash in.

184
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:58,490
Oh, it doesn't.

185
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,060
Why did you?

186
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,630
Were you wanting it to do that?

187
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,463
Never.

188
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:04,380
- Hi, hand.

189
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,213
Hi.

190
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,780
See, we can like
squeeze messages to each other.

191
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,773
- Rescue me from this place.

192
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:12,896
- A SOS.

193
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,284
Yes.

194
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:15,403
Help.

195
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,980
Yes.

196
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,813
- I'll save you.

197
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:41,986
Oh no.

198
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,104
- I brought kites.

199
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:46,780
- Yeah, probably later.

200
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,994
Looks like we're gonna-

201
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,424
- Yeah, we're gonna play that game now.

202
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,661
- Ringolevio.

203
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:51,494
Ringolevio.

204
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,395
Ringolevio.

205
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:54,312
Ringolevio.

206
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,640
- That's like capture the flag, right?

207
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,053
- Sure.

208
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:01,821
Yeah, exactly
like capture the flag.

209
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,160
- Okay, who's going to explain the rules

210
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,563
to young Ada here?

211
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,383
Ozzie?

212
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,703
- Well.

213
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,853
All right.

214
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,630
First thing.

215
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,600
Pick teams.

216
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,570
- We are uneven.

217
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,360
- Oh, I've gotta be on
the three person team.

218
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,540
- Yeah, we don't want her going in blind

219
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,057
and with a handicap, right?

220
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,450
You shouldn't be on Ozzie's team.

221
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,900
He's spurned to buttering
his own teammates into jail.

222
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,844
- Well, I guess I know who I got.

223
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:29,677
Sister for sale.

224
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:30,529
Sister for sale.

225
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,234
I'm just calling
it how I see it, okay.

226
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,410
- Okay, it's Ada, Wren, and me.

227
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,610
- And then, Marissa and Ozzie.

228
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,530
- We got that, Wren.

229
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,520
Okay, the main thing is you're trying

230
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,690
to avoid the other team's jail

231
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,020
while getting everyone from
that team into your jail.

232
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,810
You can retrieve your
teammates if their caught,

233
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,240
but at your own peril.

234
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
No puppy guarding.

235
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
No tackling.

236
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,350
You can daisy chain but
don't be a dick about it.

237
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,890
Taunting is obnoxious.

238
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,760
And if blood is drawn, the game is over.

239
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,550
Use whatever strategy you want.

240
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,858
And we play as long as it takes

241
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,653
to get one whole team into jail.

242
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,333
That's it.

243
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,203
Oh, and bring a flair to
your side and light it.

244
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,051
Come on, let's play.

245
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,030
- Don't die.

246
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,054
- Big time.

247
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,033
- Ozzie is.

248
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,710
He's more likely to try
and like mind game us.

249
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,160
We could go bold if we wanted to.

250
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,000
Should we go bold?

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,820
- That has literally never worked.

252
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,313
- Just hear me out for once.

253
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:52,130
Wait, do you even get the game?

254
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,963
'Cause we have to win.

255
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,480
We can't lose so you have to get the game.

256
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,313
- Pretty sure.

257
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:56,600
I mean, catch them.

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,914
Don't get caught.

259
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:59,909
- Yeah, she gets it.

260
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,428
We should go bold.

261
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,261
Come on, let's do it.

262
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,113
- Classic strategy.

263
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:26,377
ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

264
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:27,507
- Oh shit.

265
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:38,501
- Yeah, you better run, Wren.

266
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:45,700
- I didn't think you'd be first.

267
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,550
I'm proud of you, professor.

268
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,960
You made this quite easy for me.

269
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,617
- This is my throne?
- Here you go, yes.

270
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,670
- Thank you.

271
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,970
- Enjoy.
- See you later.

272
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,303
- Oh my god.

273
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,860
- Okay, it's like they
always go that way, right?

274
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,380
So we'll both charge them on the right.

275
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,213
We go the same way.

276
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:16,880
No, no, no, no.

277
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,983
Yeah?

278
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:18,816
Okay, yeah, yeah.

279
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:19,900
- Yeah, we both go right.

280
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,740
- Sure, fine.

281
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,573
Okay.

282
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:22,470
All right, I'm ready.

283
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,303
- Oh.

284
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,136
Come on.

285
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,969
Woo hoo hoo.

286
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,990
ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

287
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,940
- Get her, Marissa.

288
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,483
Ada, Marissa.

289
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,640
I got you now, dummy.

290
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,740
Let's go.

291
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,500
Come on, cross over.

292
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,613
Oh, I'm on your side.

293
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,010
You took that.

294
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,860
- Dammit.

295
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,693
- Knock, knock.

296
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:58,780
- Who's there?

297
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,698
- Off the jail you.

298
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:00,860
That doesn't make any sense.

299
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,693
Oh yeah.

300
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:03,110
Oh yeah, it does.

301
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:11,517
Oh my god.

302
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,850
- Wren, come on.

303
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,396
- Get up.

304
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,229
Get in the ring.

305
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:18,320
Respect the ring, boys.

306
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,690
- I will respect nothing.

307
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,613
- Your foot in.

308
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:22,970
- It's in, it's in.

309
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,803
- Nice job, love you.

310
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:24,808
- Dude, you're not even giving me

311
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:25,860
like a little bit of the log.

312
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,693
Honestly, man.

313
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,623
Okay.

314
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,682
Do you have the hacky sack?

315
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,020
- It's outside the ring.

316
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,890
- We can't be outside the ring.

317
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,723
- Code of honor.

318
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,030
- Yeah, screw that.

319
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,413
I'm bored.

320
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,443
- Nowhere to run.

321
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,920
What are you gonna hit me with a stick?

322
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,513
Look, you're the last one left.

323
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,660
We can play another game.

324
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,833
Just give into me and
I will take you home.

325
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:19,331
- Never.

326
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:20,164
- Come on, really?

327
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:23,973
I'm gonna get ya.

328
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,777
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- Victory.

329
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:34,920
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

330
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

331
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,413
- Oh no.

332
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,692
Oh boy, oh boy.

333
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:39,525
What do I do?

334
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:42,044
- Help me get her up.

335
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:42,877
- Guys, it's fine.

336
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,710
It's fine.

337
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,184
I'm fine.

338
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,832
Oh fuck.

339
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:47,686
Get out of the way.

340
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,269
Get out of the way.

341
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,843
Hey, head to the barn.

342
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,707
Get out of the way.

343
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:08,290
Fuck, Marissa, are you okay?

344
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,123
Wren, get the packs.

345
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:10,238
- Okay, okay.

346
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,071
Move.

347
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,955
Arthur, grab her shoe.

348
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,020
Wren, the first aid kid.

349
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,853
I don't know where that is.

350
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:19,696
- Arthur, find the first aid kit.

351
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,569
- No, no, guys, her leg.

352
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,746
- Disinfect it.

353
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,593
It's alcohol.

354
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,542
It's all right.

355
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,375
That's sugar.

356
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,208
It has sugar in it.

357
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,041
- My fucking way.

358
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:28,874
Okay, okay.

359
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:29,707
- Open this for me.

360
00:17:29,707 --> 00:17:30,957
Yes.

361
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,914
I got you, I got you.

362
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:34,747
- Marissa.

363
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:37,747
You're gonna be all right.

364
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,964
It doesn't look that bad.

365
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:41,878
It's too tight.

366
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,865
Can you not do it so tight please?

367
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:44,698
Take her shoe.

368
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,531
Take her shoe.

369
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,364
- Take her shoe?

370
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:47,380
Take her shoe off.

371
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,220
I got you, I got you.

372
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,053
Ow, ow, fuck.

373
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,210
- Sorry, sorry.

374
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,670
Goddammit.

375
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,785
Is that too tight?

376
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,420
No.

377
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,920
- Yeah, all right.

378
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:57,669
All right.

379
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,427
What happened?

380
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,860
- We were playing the game
and I was dodging her.

381
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,240
She was running at me and
she tripped over something.

382
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,430
Guys, she needs to go to the hospital.

383
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,460
- We got it.

384
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,370
We got it.

385
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,220
- You don't need to go to the hospital.

386
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,270
You're a Faber, yeah?

387
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,073
We were so close to winning.

388
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,990
We won.

389
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,312
You guys okay?

390
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,393
What's next?

391
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:48,035
Hey Wren, got some cards?

392
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,379
Let's work on those decks, boys.

393
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:58,838
There's gotta be 52 cards in
there between the three of 'em.

394
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,505
Ah, Wren.

395
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,466
What do we have?

396
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,716
How 'bout that?

397
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:09,657
Hearts.

398
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:14,306
- Can we just deal already please?

399
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:15,163
Five, 10, jack, 10, four.

400
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,073
- Can we deal?

401
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,680
Be ready to ante up.

402
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,739
- Cool, so what does this mean?

403
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,350
What do you mean?

404
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,000
- Well I have a black ace
and then I have a red five.

405
00:19:29,026 --> 00:19:30,632
What?

406
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:31,465
- Rigged.

407
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,510
- You can't say your cards.

408
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,393
It's poker.

409
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,798
- Right, right.

410
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,080
- I bid a lot.

411
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,641
How much?

412
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,474
- I don't know.

413
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,617
- Doesn't matter because
I am going to go all in.

414
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:05,303
- All right.

415
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,413
Straight, count 'em.

416
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,657
- Oh, that's a really good hand.

417
00:20:12,117 --> 00:20:14,153
What do you have?

418
00:20:14,153 --> 00:20:15,353
- I just have these two.

419
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,190
You have a flush.

420
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,040
Does a flush beat a straight?

421
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,883
She doesn't even know.

422
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:24,720
It's okay.

423
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,940
- Dammit.

424
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,310
Renny.

425
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,910
- So a flush does beat a straight?

426
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,743
- Yes, it does.

427
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,503
- Good.

428
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:33,702
All these
chips belong to you now.

429
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:34,535
- Ooh.

430
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:38,883
- What's he doing?

431
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:41,740
- Probably looking for something to break.

432
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,690
- Yeah, he's just getting off some steam.

433
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,763
- Was that a bad beat?

434
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,320
I've seen "Rounders".

435
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,640
- Oh my god, seriously?

436
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,490
- That's the bet.

437
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:14,278
Call or fold, Marissa.

438
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:16,078
Call or fold, Marissa.

439
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:18,005
Call or fold, Marissa.

440
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:18,838
- I fold.

441
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,910
- She folded.

442
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,482
Wow.

443
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,921
- I win again.

444
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,610
- Ooh wow.

445
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,900
Ooh wow.

446
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,700
What a hand I have.

447
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,990
Such a hot hand.

448
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,540
Bet you can't beat this hand, Ada.

449
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,890
Ooh.

450
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,140
Ooh, what a great hand.

451
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,230
Arthur folds.

452
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,191
- I'll call.
- What?

453
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:50,300
There's no surprise there.
- I'll call.

454
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,653
Some good action.

455
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,010
All right.

456
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,960
Let's see the flop.

457
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,990
You're all in.

458
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,823
- Yup.

459
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:00,060
And I fold.

460
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,893
What?

461
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:03,680
Wait what?

462
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,513
- You win.

463
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:07,865
- Wow.

464
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:08,698
- We can deal it out.

465
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:09,537
No, no, it's fine.

466
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,790
Marissa.

467
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,623
- You win again.

468
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:12,634
I found it.

469
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,551
I found it.

470
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:15,384
Found what?

471
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:17,270
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

472
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,483
It's gonna be good.

473
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,243
- Come on, seriously?

474
00:22:27,243 --> 00:22:28,076
Turn that off.

475
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,299
Turn it off.

476
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,132
Never.

477
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,430
- There's no reason for that
to be playing right now, okay.

478
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,304
There's every reason.

479
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,137
- No, there's not.

480
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:35,970
Turn it off.

481
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,803
No, come on.

482
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:37,636
Turn it off.

483
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:38,469
- What's the big deal?

484
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:39,302
- Wren, turn it off.

485
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,135
Turn it off.

486
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,130
Whoa, Wren.

487
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,963
What?

488
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:42,903
Wren, you are going too far.

489
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,297
- I'm not.

490
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,870
What?

491
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,280
Come on, we're having a
fun family Easter reunion.

492
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,934
Whatever it is we're calling this.

493
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:52,850
I don't know.

494
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,683
What is this?

495
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:54,810
I mean.

496
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,460
Come on, we can't have
a true family reunion

497
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,070
without playing this god awful music

498
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,983
that she made us listen to for years.

499
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,403
- God awful music?

500
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,772
Yeah.

501
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,454
It's pretty down.

502
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:20,694
- It's about time you
were gonna be an asshole.

503
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:21,527
- What?

504
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,110
What are you doing?

505
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:26,810
What?

506
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,560
Marissa, I'm sorry.

507
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,623
What?

508
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:37,493
- Come on, man.

509
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:38,326
- What?

510
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,593
- Hey.

511
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:53,687
Marissa.

512
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,460
- I got you so good.

513
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,433
- Dude, that's not cool.

514
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,710
- Had ya.

515
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,543
Had ya.

516
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,900
- Do you wanna talk?

517
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,643
- Not really, but I guess
that wouldn't be fair to you.

518
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,263
- We can just sit.

519
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,680
- Man, I know you're trying
to get along with them,

520
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,530
but does it have to be at my expense?

521
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,430
- Wait, what?

522
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,680
- During poker you were
being kind of a dick.

523
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,193
- I thought you were mad about the CD.

524
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,883
- No.

525
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:00,340
Wren's an asshole, but
he's always an asshole.

526
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,173
- Okay.

527
00:25:02,372 --> 00:25:04,763
What does that even mean?

528
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,590
I mean, I was just trying
to get along with them

529
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,490
and I thought I was doing pretty okay.

530
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,983
- Yeah, you are doing pretty okay.

531
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:14,933
It's just.

532
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,112
I'm in enough pain already, you know?

533
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:19,945
- Oh my god.

534
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:21,360
Look, I'm sorry.

535
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,193
Okay?

536
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,063
- What?

537
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:25,230
- Look, I'm sorry you hurt your leg.

538
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,326
- I'm not.

539
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,610
I'm not mad at you about that.

540
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,470
I'm not, okay.

541
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,650
All I'm saying is that
I'm in enough fucking pain

542
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,440
and you don't need to pile on, okay.

543
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,573
They do that enough.

544
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:38,918
- Okay.

545
00:25:38,918 --> 00:25:39,751
- Is it okay?
- Okay, yeah.

546
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,478
- Am I being unreasonable?

547
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,460
- I get it.

548
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,343
I went too far.

549
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,813
- I don't mind.

550
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:15,565
Just do what you're gonna do.

551
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,080
What?

552
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,240
- Oh.

553
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,073
I run at night.

554
00:26:19,073 --> 00:26:20,750
Otherwise I have nightmares.

555
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,283
Not the manliest thing
to admit, but you know.

556
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,003
Tonight's got me all wound up.

557
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:35,089
You know.

558
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,020
You know, you shouldn't feel bad

559
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,653
about not doing anything
about Marissa out there.

560
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,497
These things, they happen, you know?

561
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:54,687
You know, I'm not sure if Marissa
really tells you about us.

562
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,403
You know, if they would've let me,

563
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:01,960
I would've adopted Marissa and
Wren the second I turned 18.

564
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,060
Arthur, too, if he wasn't right behind me.

565
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,890
You know, when our mom
went to rehab again,

566
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,951
they were gonna send Marissa
to live with Grandma who,

567
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:20,893
well Grandma only wanted to.

568
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:24,883
She was sketchy.

569
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:29,590
I'm sure Marissa told you about that one.

570
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,650
Yeah, she collected rocking chair horses.

571
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,674
She sold them at auction
every summer in Florida.

572
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:39,350
Well, she'd lived off that
money all year, drink,

573
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,735
and watch porn all day.

574
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:45,283
Marissa would've been
miserable with her in New York.

575
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,940
What I mean to say is that
we're each other's family.

576
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,343
We're more than just family.

577
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,165
I mean, that's what you're stepping into.

578
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,300
Out of all the homes and aunts

579
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,440
and stuff we were moved around to,

580
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,130
those years that the
four of us had together,

581
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,673
I mean those were the really good ones.

582
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,240
Marissa's more.

583
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:16,833
She's our favorite.

584
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,212
And Wren, he's young, you know.

585
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,026
I mean, he has to be the asshole.

586
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:22,859
He is.

587
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,153
She's tough.

588
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,449
She's tough because we
wouldn't let her be weak.

589
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,512
- Sh.

590
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,762
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

591
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,568
She has to be.

592
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,580
- Hey.

593
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,560
Hey.

594
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,393
- Sh.

595
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:20,560
- What's going on?

596
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,223
- We're gonna get Marissa.

597
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,430
- Get her?

598
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,350
- Yeah, favorite tradition.

599
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,760
We used to soak towels
and throw at Marissa

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,593
when she was sleeping.

601
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:30,426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:31,769
- Why?

603
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:32,993
- You know.

604
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,983
I don't really know why we do it.

605
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,340
- Because it's funny, dummy.

606
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,103
- Oh yeah.

607
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:41,943
It's funny.

608
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,220
- Well you know Marissa's
really tired tonight so.

609
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,053
- So?

610
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,113
- So maybe you shouldn't do that tonight.

611
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,590
- Oh.

612
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,113
- Maybe we can like get Marissa tomorrow.

613
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,283
- I see.

614
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,143
- What are we gonna do
with all these wet towels?

615
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:09,220
- I suppose we'll just
have to dry them, yeah.

616
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,350
- Wait, just don't tickle me.

617
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,500
We're supposed to.

618
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,333
It's tradition.

619
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,166
- Sorry we woke you up.

620
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,590
Goodnight, Arthur.

621
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,508
Goodnight.

622
00:31:15,508 --> 00:31:16,920
- Goodnight.

623
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,753
Wow.

624
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,093
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

625
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:21,340
What did you just do?

626
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,640
- I just said wow and
it blows the candle out.

627
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:28,830
- Ozzie, where's your lighter?

628
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,663
- Drawer.

629
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:34,143
- Just say wow and it blows it out.

630
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:37,938
There we go.

631
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:43,889
Wow, wow.

632
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:46,682
Wow.

633
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:47,515
- It's like he's enchanting it.

634
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,150
- Lies.

635
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,360
- No, you gotta with aplomb.

636
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,193
- Aplomb?

637
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:01,887
- Poof.

638
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,241
- That's kind of cool.

639
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:04,241
- Go for it.

640
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,933
- Wow.

641
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,983
- Aplomb.

642
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,620
All right, y'all.

643
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,453
Goodnight.

644
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,231
- Ada, where did you learn this?

645
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,064
- My mom.

646
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,843
- Three, two, one.

647
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,820
Wow.

648
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,653
What?

649
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:30,520
- Ozzie.

650
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,353
- Making a wish.

651
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:34,856
Wow.

652
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,040
- Ready?

653
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,410
- Yeah, I'm good.

654
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,805
- Fuck, okay, let me do it again.

655
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:17,000
Let me do it again.

656
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,833
Sorry, that failed.

657
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:18,900
- Good morning.

658
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,370
Morning.

659
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,690
- Hey, why didn't you wake me up?

660
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,880
- You were nightmaring all night.

661
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,960
I thought you would use some extra rest.

662
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,860
Oh, I was?

663
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,350
Yeah, it's
been awhile but yeah.

664
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,530
- I didn't like wake up Wren.

665
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,180
Don't worry about it.

666
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,903
- I'm sorry.

667
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:36,037
Thank you.

668
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:37,660
Did she sleepwalk?

669
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,784
- No.

670
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:39,784
I wish.

671
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,600
Do you want some crinkle?

672
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,433
- Crinkle?

673
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:43,266
What's crinkle?

674
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:44,420
Crinkle is a little dessert.

675
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,253
- Sure.

676
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:46,580
But it's
disguised as breakfast.

677
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,413
- Perfect.

678
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:48,640
- So, you're supposed to stay

679
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,872
in the house until Ozzie's finished.

680
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:52,560
With the eggs.

681
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,965
Oh, did he get to the chickens?

682
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:54,970
No.

683
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,496
Easter eggs.

684
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,400
Oh, you guys do that.

685
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,810
- Not really.

686
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,380
- Yeah, Ozzie says it's a special treat

687
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,327
for our honored guest.

688
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:05,750
- You were supposed to help.

689
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,140
- Whoa.

690
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,996
- Morning.

691
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:08,920
- Oh dude, crinkle sweet.

692
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,850
Maybe if you got
an alarm clock, it'd help.

693
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,880
That's our dog.

694
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,193
Yeah, got him
out the pound last week.

695
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,798
I don't know
what to think about him.

696
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:20,293
Oh no, I
think he's a mixed breed.

697
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,443
Ooh, found one.

698
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,903
Nice, Ris.

699
00:34:34,778 --> 00:34:36,565
Marissa, look.

700
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:38,057
Just leave it.

701
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:39,720
No, I'm gonna get it.

702
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,553
Why?

703
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:41,947
It'll fester in a week
and smell really bad.

704
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,597
Then we'll have to get it anyway.

705
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,430
Can we just go inside please?

706
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,580
It's freezing outside.

707
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,900
- Just this one last egg
and then I will go inside,

708
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,150
get a blanket, and wrap you up,

709
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,623
and breathe my hot air on you.

710
00:34:57,558 --> 00:34:58,834
Yes.

711
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:06,829
Marissa.

712
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,710
I've literally just walked around

713
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,370
this entire place looking for you.

714
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,870
I thought you disappeared.

715
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,540
- I'm a magician.

716
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,373
Poof.

717
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:12,160
- So, all of the doors
to the house are locked.

718
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,040
- Yeah, I think they went to
work and they locked us out.

719
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,021
Oh.

720
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:19,430
- Yeah, it's pretty typical.

721
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,620
Like they either completely
forgot that we were here

722
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,340
or they wanted to just fend for ourself.

723
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,380
- Okay, yeah.

724
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,603
So what time do they get off of work?

725
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,653
- Not 'til late.

726
00:36:32,932 --> 00:36:35,953
We can go into town or
something if you want.

727
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,759
- In my pajamas?

728
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,410
- Okay, why don't we
get you some new clothes

729
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,260
and I'm about to give you the hottest tour

730
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,690
of my hometown that you've ever seen.

731
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,588
You ready?

732
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:46,421
Good.

733
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:04,980
Come on.

734
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,813
- I can't.

735
00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:09,100
Why?

736
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,063
- I'm wearing pajamas.

737
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,494
Fine, fine.

738
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,166
Hey.

739
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,063
Hello.

740
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,023
Miss.

741
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:50,022
Miss.

742
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,893
Hello.

743
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,560
Could you roll your window down?

744
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:48,520
- Let's go.

745
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,283
Do you?

746
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:27,867
Do you wanna get a hotel
room for the night?

747
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,210
Sleep in the same bed?

748
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,360
My own bathroom would be nice.

749
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,123
- Nice.

750
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:47,022
Everything looks so different now.

751
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,720
This house is where Ozzie

752
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,033
lost his virginity homecoming night.

753
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,120
And this guy used to be abandoned,

754
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,800
so Wren used to break in there

755
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,430
and he would write his poetry there.

756
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,930
That's what he said.

757
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,193
He also broke in here.

758
00:40:07,044 --> 00:40:09,620
Wren was accused of breaking in there

759
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,890
and then broke in there anyway

760
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,330
'cause he thought he
couldn't get in trouble

761
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,883
due to double jeopardy.

762
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:18,580
And then that church looking thing

763
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,080
is where Wren and Ozzie
went to elementary school.

764
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,610
And what did you do?

765
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,840
Well I
didn't break in anywhere

766
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,863
and all my schools were
on the other side of town.

767
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,560
- Quite a tour then.

768
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,870
- One time Ozzie and Wren.

769
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:37,970
They got all of those marshmallow breads

770
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,420
with their girlfriends at that bakery

771
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,520
and then they brought them all to school

772
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,874
and spray painted them to look.

773
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:49,670
Okay.

774
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,247
- Hey.

775
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,840
Oh ow, ow, ow, fuck.

776
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,160
Fuck, ow, ow, fuck.

777
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:03,993
What, what's wrong?

778
00:44:03,993 --> 00:44:04,826
- Nothing, nothing.

779
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:05,659
It's just my legs.

780
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:06,570
It's okay.

781
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,470
Your legs?

782
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,210
- Fuck, whatever.

783
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,043
My leg.

784
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:16,470
Come here.

785
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,357
Well that was the fastest
sex we've ever had.

786
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,163
- You can't freeze me out, okay.

787
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,570
- How am I freezing you out?

788
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,283
- It was accident, Marissa.

789
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,620
I'm just trying to get along with them.

790
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,270
Like play the game.

791
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,820
And like meet them at their level.

792
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,930
Okay, what's going on now?

793
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,173
- But if I also get along with
them too well, that's bad.

794
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:55,040
- This is all because I
said my leg was hurting me.

795
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,020
- I'm trying here, Marissa.

796
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,853
Okay, great.

797
00:44:57,853 --> 00:44:59,480
- But I can't have you setting

798
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,574
these parameters around my behavior.

799
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,270
What parameters am I setting

800
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,103
around your behavior?

801
00:45:04,103 --> 00:45:06,780
- Because I am already left out, okay.

802
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,613
- Oh yeah.

803
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:08,490
Like I'm the odd one out.

804
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,450
- Yeah, I'm sure it's really hard for you.

805
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,680
Okay and your
brothers, they're weird.

806
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,720
They're really weird.

807
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,890
And they are rude.

808
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,650
And you don't even side with me on things.

809
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,483
- Okay, Jesus.

810
00:45:17,483 --> 00:45:19,163
Fuck, I get it, okay.

811
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,600
I won't freeze you out, okay.

812
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,266
Can you turn the TV back on?

813
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:54,060
- Sure.

814
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,073
- God, I love the weather so much.

815
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,133
- Me too.

816
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,313
- Ooh, it's like a double bounce.

817
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,363
- Oh wait.

818
00:47:57,363 --> 00:47:58,298
Now we're off again.

819
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,480
Now we're on again.
- Hey, Ada.

820
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,313
- Hey.

821
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:07,459
Ozzie wants us to
meet hm at the station soon.

822
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,493
The station?

823
00:48:09,493 --> 00:48:10,713
- Yeah, the radio station.

824
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah, his
regulars are out of town

825
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,690
and he needs us to record
some segment for Easter.

826
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,523
It'll be fun.

827
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:18,356
- Sure.

828
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,565
- Also, can you stay at the house tonight?

829
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:26,030
They were kinda pissed.

830
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,173
Oh, okay yeah.

831
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,310
- But you know why we did this, right?

832
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,000
You guys locked us out.

833
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,220
Like we had to do this.

834
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,690
- Yeah.

835
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,320
So.

836
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,663
Sorry, I thought I told
Wren not to lock it.

837
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,560
He was trying to be funny.

838
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,190
Well it wasn't.

839
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,023
- Yeah.

840
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:53,487
But he doesn't have to be around today

841
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:56,173
and he does not know
about the radio station.

842
00:48:57,617 --> 00:48:59,073
- Don't tell him.

843
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,603
- You got it.

844
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,250
I'll wait in the car.

845
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,250
Roll your window down.

846
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:33,083
- Hey.

847
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,250
- Right on Main.

848
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,990
- And then left on Parker, okay.

849
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,270
- Okay.
- Parker.

850
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,863
- Okay, okay.

851
00:49:38,863 --> 00:49:40,450
- And then just go up, okay.

852
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,810
It's on the third floor.

853
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,700
Third floor?

854
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,533
- Fourth.

855
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,366
- The fourth floor.

856
00:49:44,366 --> 00:49:45,821
We're gonna get some coffee.

857
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,533
- Hey.

858
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:31,210
- Arthur took Marissa to get coffee, yeah?

859
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,490
Yeah.

860
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:33,323
- Welcome.

861
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:40,100
So we have about 30 minutes
before they get here.

862
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,630
Would you mind helping me
record some local commercials

863
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:44,730
before tomorrow's broadcast?

864
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,600
- You want me to do that?

865
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,540
Yeah, if that's cool.

866
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,560
- Yeah, yeah.

867
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,830
I mean, as long as I'm not
like live on air or anything.

868
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:53,290
And I mean, you have scripts?

869
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,123
- Script.

870
00:50:54,123 --> 00:50:55,340
I only need one from you.

871
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,173
Cool.

872
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,353
- Deep breath.

873
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,810
So how long have you worked here?

874
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,903
- A few years.

875
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:06,525
I actually don't remember.

876
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:09,270
And you went to
school for journalism then?

877
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,280
- Oh no, I didn't need a
degree in journalism for this.

878
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,002
I just knew a guy that knew
a guy on my football team.

879
00:51:14,002 --> 00:51:17,203
Got a job, liked it, kept it.

880
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,870
- You played football?

881
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,186
- Oh yeah, everyone did.

882
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:23,220
- Football's cool.

883
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,740
- Okay.

884
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,573
In here.

885
00:51:27,586 --> 00:51:28,640
That chair.

886
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,473
Okay.

887
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,193
So what are we doing?

888
00:51:34,053 --> 00:51:37,950
- Oh, it's a 20 second spot
for a local rental place.

889
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,080
- Oh, like a car rental?

890
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,040
- No, like.

891
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,207
No, you'll see.

892
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:44,810
- So what kind of like voice should I use?

893
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,450
- Like a radio voice.

894
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:48,283
- Whoa.

895
00:51:49,556 --> 00:51:50,389
Okay.

896
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,490
It's.

897
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,900
Sorry.

898
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,848
It's finally-

899
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:02,742
- Oh wait, sorry.

900
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:03,921
I didn't know you were gonna do that.

901
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,192
- Oh.
- Just have to hit.

902
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:06,025
Go.

903
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:07,430
- Oh.

904
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,080
It is finally spring.

905
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,980

- Well.

915

and maybe you know smile when you talk.

916
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,963
- Okay.

917
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,140
Actually, I can't.

918
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,973
I can't do this.

919
00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:43,548
Marissa can you just
take my spot and do that?

920
00:52:43,548 --> 00:52:44,570
Okay.

921
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:45,883
What am I doing?

922
00:52:50,077 --> 00:52:51,674
- It's really easy.

923
00:52:51,674 --> 00:52:53,293
There's a script.

924
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,763

00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,743
behind the Seekers Sports Complex.

936
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:30,923
- Okay, good.

937
00:53:30,923 --> 00:53:32,010
We got it.

938
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,723
That was really bad, Oz.

939
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,260
So we go on in three minutes.

940
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,320
- Okay.

941
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,350
I'll assume the position.

942
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:39,840
- Oh no, no, Arthur.

943
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,673
I don't think we need you.

944
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:41,590
We'll just have Marissa.

945
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:46,171
- What?

946
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:47,903
- Yeah.

947
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:51,090
Oh, yeah, I got your songs.

948
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,070
So we'll play a song from your new album

949
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,740
and then just talk about it.

950
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,573
- How did?

951
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,153
What?

952
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,170
- Yeah.

953
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,997
I got 'em from your like
manager or something.

954
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:03,143
Through the station.

955
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,110
- Okay.

956
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,010
- All right, we're on in five seconds.

957
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,630
Good afternoon, listeners.

958
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,780
All y'all's gearing up for Easter lunch?

959
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,040
All the families together
counting the chickens

960
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,240
before they hatch or whatever.

961
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,940
Today I have my gorgeous
sister with me in the booth

962
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,550
and we have an exclusive release

963
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:32,550
of her new upcoming album
of computery music for y'all

964
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,300
and it is called "Lighthouse",
the song we're gonna hear.

965
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,910
Marissa, do you have anything to say

966
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,923
to the nice folks before we roll it?

967
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,300
- Nope.

968
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,063
- All right, well let's roll it.

969
00:55:47,301 --> 00:55:48,134
- Hey, Oz.

970
00:55:48,134 --> 00:55:48,967
Yeah.

971
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:51,420
- Can you just not ask me
anything about the song?

972
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,880
Okay, it's just like a song, you know.

973
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,480
- You've convinced me to
your power of conversation.

974
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,373
- Thank you.

975
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,930
- And that was "Lighthouse"
by Marissa Faber,

976
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,170
our prodigal sister back
for the holiday weekend.

977
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,003
So.

978
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,410
Marissa.

979
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,460
Can you tell us a little more
about your forthcoming album?

980
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,293
- Sure.

981
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:20,106
Yeah, I can give a little
sneak peek I guess.

982
00:56:20,106 --> 00:56:24,090
The album is called "Compass Key"

983
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:29,090
and it's all sort of
about specific memories

984
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,160
that I have of when I was younger.

985
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,710
A lot of them are about growing up here

986
00:56:36,412 --> 00:56:40,060
and you know I moved to Chicago

987
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,520
and I haven't been up here as often

988
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,763
as I would like and I think.

989
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,830
I think the album is just
sort of like a reminder

990
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,790
to not make the same
mistakes that I made before.

991
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:55,623
- What mistakes?

992
00:56:55,623 --> 00:56:56,897
You're perfect.

993
00:56:56,897 --> 00:56:57,900
- I'm not perfect.

994
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,422
We did a bunch of crazy shit when we were.

995
00:57:00,422 --> 00:57:01,374
Stuff.

996
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:03,302
We did a lot of crazy.

997
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:05,210
We got into some crazy stuff.

998
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,590
- Right, right, right.

999
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,490
- Crazy stuff when we
were younger, you know.

1000
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,856
- So "Lighthouse".

1001
00:57:10,856 --> 00:57:12,673
That one's about me, right?

1002
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:14,843
- It's not.

1003
00:57:14,843 --> 00:57:15,920
I'm so sorry.

1004
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,917
It's not.

1005
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:19,293
- Well, so it is about me.

1006
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,349
Wow.

1007
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:22,182
It's really not.

1008
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:23,015
- Oh.

1009
00:57:26,261 --> 00:57:27,094
- No.

1010
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,360
- Well, listeners, I think
I know what's going on here.

1011
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,463
- That song is about an ex of mine.

1012
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,273
- Right.

1013
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:46,090
Well, in recent news, a 240
year old tavern in Dublin has-

1014
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,593
- I guess, okay, I guess that song is.

1015
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,930
I think the reason why I wrote it

1016
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,810
is like in that relationship,

1017
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,810
he just didn't get me at all, you know.

1018
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,970
We were always like at
arms length of each other

1019
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,970
'cause he just had no
idea how to understand me

1020
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,363
or like our upbringing or anything and.

1021
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,653
He just didn't vibe with it and.

1022
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,433
So I wrote.

1023
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,850
I wrote that I guess as
an expression of that.

1024
00:58:27,718 --> 00:58:30,770
- Well, not all relationships
are built to last.

1025
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,593
Okay well, the album is
coming out July 12th.

1026
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,870
- Hope you like it.

1027
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,610
- Up next we kick off the hog wild hour

1028
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,940
featuring all your favorites, KISS, AC/DC.

1029
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,173
All of 'em, we got it right
here on 92.7 WCLO The Hog.

1030
00:58:51,718 --> 00:58:53,885
- Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

1031
00:59:47,305 --> 00:59:48,530
- Fuck.

1032
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:16,376
Got it?

1033
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:17,628
- Yeah.

1034
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,051
Smells awesome.

1035
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:51,112
Your ketchup
or some of that ketchup?

1036
01:00:51,112 --> 01:00:52,893
- Give me some of that chuck.

1037
01:00:54,064 --> 01:00:54,897
Oh my god.

1038
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,859
- Hey.

1039
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,103
Food good?

1040
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,936
- Yeah, it's great.

1041
01:01:03,936 --> 01:01:04,917
Thanks, Ada.
- It's really good.

1042
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:05,750
Thank you, Ada.

1043
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,583
I appreciate it.

1044
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:07,416
- It's good.

1045
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:08,461
The best.

1046
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:11,300
Yeah.

1047
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,133
- Anyway.

1048
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,703
Hang on just one second.

1049
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,035
- Bet you it's a surprise.

1050
01:01:25,026 --> 01:01:27,004
Act surprised.

1051
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:28,204
- I like good surprises.

1052
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,048
- Well let's stay open to the possibility

1053
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:34,245
that it might be a good surprise.

1054
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:35,078
- Okay.

1055
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:39,209
- Okay.

1056
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,800
- Did you make this?

1057
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,913
- Gross.

1058
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,463
Groany.

1059
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,703
- What?

1060
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,503
Wow, seriously bugs.

1061
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,960
- Yeah.

1062
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,910
I mean, you just kind of get
used to it after a little bit.

1063
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,065
Like this guy.

1064
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:16,630
I found this one when I was in the Ozarks.

1065
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:18,920
It was like January out
and he was still out

1066
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,433
in like plain sight.

1067
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,900
I wasn't really prepared to catch him,

1068
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,463
but you know, you make due.

1069
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,490
I found this one when I was in Newcastle

1070
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,240
upon a time when I went to England.

1071
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,683
You know, that was Easter weekend, too.

1072
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:36,590
It was like the only other Easter

1073
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,974
that I spent away from my family.

1074
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:41,550
I guess at the time I
thought I was gonna have

1075
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:43,410
this like incredible time

1076
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,240
and meet all these incredible people,

1077
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,940
but you know when I got there,

1078
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,810
it was mostly just like series of meals

1079
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,230
at pubs and inns by myself.

1080
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,120
No one really talked to me.

1081
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,670
I didn't really talk to anyone.

1082
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,153
Think I felt pretty alone on that trip.

1083
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:07,850
I guess I thought it was gonna be better

1084
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,523
to spend Easter alone.

1085
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,490
You know, and I wasn't really like.

1086
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,010
I just really didn't
wanna spend another Easter

1087
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,893
with my family sitting around
the table and faking it.

1088
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,410
So I guess it was good that I was

1089
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,483
like across the world and by myself.

1090
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:33,993
And I found this guy.

1091
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,033
This cucujidae.

1092
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,703
He's perfect.

1093
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:43,270
Cucujidae.

1094
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,093
Perfect.

1095
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:48,221
- I have more.

1096
01:03:50,151 --> 01:03:51,280
Do you wanna see one?

1097
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,373
Oh my god.

1098
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:55,020
Melolontha.

1099
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,833
Melolontha frater.

1100
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,805
Agonum.

1101
01:03:59,805 --> 01:04:00,638
What's that?

1102
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:05,555
- Sex.

1103
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:07,210
Sexpunctatum.

1104
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,744
- I really like this one, too.

1105
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:09,577
- Oh.

1106
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:10,410
Oh wow.

1107
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:11,277
- Got a sting around him.

1108
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:12,433
- Nasty.
- Got chills.

1109
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:13,659
I got chills.
- Oh my god, ew.

1110
01:04:13,659 --> 01:04:15,253
Can you show us how?

1111
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,033
How do you do this?

1112
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:18,960
How do you find them?

1113
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,332
How do you catch them?

1114
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:21,165
- Oh.

1115
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:22,650
Do you?

1116
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,483
- Tonight?

1117
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,793
I guess the best way.

1118
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:29,867
You know what?

1119
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:33,523
Follow me.

1120
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:39,720
All right, let's go.

1121
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,553
Yup.

1122
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,710
Ada, why do you get the big flashlight?

1123
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,710
'Cause I'm the expert.

1124
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,073
Oh yeah, this is perfect.

1125
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:51,700
Just dark enough.

1126
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,580
Oh yeah, I think we can
string it up, you see,

1127
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,640
on that little like doorway.

1128
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,473
Yeah.

1129
01:04:56,473 --> 01:04:57,650
Yeah.

1130
01:04:57,650 --> 01:04:59,163
That'd be perfect.

1131
01:05:00,935 --> 01:05:01,768
Okay.

1132
01:05:01,768 --> 01:05:02,863
It wasn't you.

1133
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:06,390
Looks a
little unfinished, Ozzie.

1134
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,640
We got plenty
projects around here.

1135
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,500
Right now, I just wanna catch some bugs.

1136
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,120
All right, do you mind
helping me string this up?

1137
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,276
Just tie it around the post.

1138
01:05:16,276 --> 01:05:17,648
Nice and tight.

1139
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:20,370
Have you used this sheet a lot?

1140
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:21,259
- Yeah, yeah.

1141
01:05:21,259 --> 01:05:22,720
Just a little higher.

1142
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,572
A little higher?

1143
01:05:23,572 --> 01:05:24,405
You got it.

1144
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:25,430
This a lucky sheet?

1145
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:26,860
- Not necessarily lucky.

1146
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:29,589
You have to replace
them every now and then.

1147
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:30,422
Okay.

1148
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,510
Yeah.

1149
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,548
There you go, tight.

1150
01:05:34,548 --> 01:05:35,536
Pull it tight.

1151
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:36,390
I got it tight.

1152
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,288
- Is yours?

1153
01:05:37,288 --> 01:05:39,530
And then you see how it's
kind of billing at the end?

1154
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:42,410
Is there something like
some of these rocks maybe?

1155
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,760
I got these right here.

1156
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,110
- Sweet, okay.

1157
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:46,100
Yeah.

1158
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,156
Oh yeah, Kool Aid man.

1159
01:05:49,156 --> 01:05:50,710
- All right now.

1160
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,720
Arthur.

1161
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,661
Ozzie, just shine your
flashlights on the sheet.

1162
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:54,610
Just anywhere?

1163
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,443
Like this?

1164
01:05:55,443 --> 01:05:56,955
- Yeah, just not so much moving around.

1165
01:05:56,955 --> 01:05:59,470
Yeah, one spot there.

1166
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,023
There you go.

1167
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,580
What kind of bugs show up?

1168
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,430
- Oh, you never really know.

1169
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,440
It's usually just like flies and moths,

1170
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,050
but sometimes you get the
cool ones like the beetles.

1171
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,430
- Nice.

1172
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:12,480
And how long do you normally wait?

1173
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,680
- As long as you can stand it.

1174
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,513
- Like fishing.

1175
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:30,853
Would you say you've waited
over 1,000 hours, 2,000 hours

1176
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,284
for bugs to show up or?

1177
01:06:33,284 --> 01:06:34,790
- It's totally, totally worth it.

1178
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,290
I promise.

1179
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,490
- You know, if you waited
more than 36 hours,

1180
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,323
that would be like-

1181
01:06:39,323 --> 01:06:40,180
Knock it off, Oz.

1182
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,460
- Cucujidae day and a half.

1183
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,670
- Oh look, you see?

1184
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:43,503
What?

1185
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:44,460
- Little ladybug.

1186
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,590
I got so many of those though.

1187
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:46,423
I don't need another one.

1188
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:47,570
Oh, of course.

1189
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,010
So many.

1190
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,133
So many of those of course.

1191
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,133
Is there smarts?

1192
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:54,966
- Knock it off.

1193
01:06:54,966 --> 01:06:55,799
All right, what?

1194
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:56,930
Just trying to have fun.

1195
01:06:58,541 --> 01:06:59,374
That's it.

1196
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,633
Fun.

1197
01:07:06,228 --> 01:07:07,570
What was it?

1198
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,962
What was that song you were singing?

1199
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:12,783
You were singing three different songs.

1200
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,256
Wait, no.

1201
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:15,358
Wren, sh.

1202
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:16,586
Just easy.

1203
01:07:16,586 --> 01:07:17,419
- Oh, holy shit.

1204
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:18,512
Who are these people?

1205
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:20,193
- A sheet party, dude.

1206
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:21,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1207
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,233
- No, no, no, just wait, just wait.

1208
01:07:22,233 --> 01:07:23,066
It'll be fine.

1209
01:07:23,066 --> 01:07:23,899
I swear to god.

1210
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:24,732
It'll be fine.

1211
01:07:24,732 --> 01:07:25,565
Hey, hey, hey.

1212
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:27,900
Hey pal, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1213
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,810
There's nails over here.

1214
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:29,648
Just would you stop?

1215
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:30,481
Nails?

1216
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:32,490
Well, I'm a nail this sheet, dude.

1217
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:33,323
Oh my god.

1218
01:07:33,323 --> 01:07:35,411
I don't know what
that means, but wait, wait.

1219
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:36,747
Wren, Wren, Wren, Wren.

1220
01:07:36,747 --> 01:07:37,580
What, what?

1221
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,990
Check me out, check me out.

1222
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,161
You see that movie?

1223
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:42,580
Toga, toga.

1224
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,561
Toga.

1225
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:46,144
Toga, toga, toga, toga.

1226
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:52,455
Wren, just give it back.

1227
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:54,221
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1228
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:55,970
We're doing a thing with Ada, come on.

1229
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:56,803
Oh wait.

1230
01:07:56,803 --> 01:07:57,992
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1231
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:59,070
Hold it, wait.

1232
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,270
Lift your chin up.

1233
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,103
Hold this.

1234
01:08:01,103 --> 01:08:02,730
- Here.

1235
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,563
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1236
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,314
- Don't worry about it.

1237
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:08,600
- Take his room upstairs.

1238
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,090
I'll make him sleep in the other room.

1239
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:11,923
- Ada.

1240
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:13,275
Wren.

1241
01:08:13,275 --> 01:08:14,108
I'm gonna eat you.

1242
01:08:14,108 --> 01:08:14,941
Wren.

1243
01:08:14,941 --> 01:08:15,774
Wren.

1244
01:08:15,774 --> 01:08:16,607
- Wren, Wren.

1245
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:18,027
It's nine o'clock.

1246
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,470
You ladies, thank you
for bringing him home.

1247
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,303
- No.

1248
01:08:21,303 --> 01:08:22,146
- All right, yes.

1249
01:08:22,146 --> 01:08:23,401
- It's my posse.
- Say goodnight.

1250
01:08:23,401 --> 01:08:24,399
- Ozzie, it's my posse.

1251
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,547
- You gotta go.
- It's my friends.

1252
01:08:25,547 --> 01:08:27,050
- You can't stay here.

1253
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,050
- You can't.

1254
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,420
- Hey, can we talk?

1255
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:22,060
I love you.

1256
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,863
Mm hm.

1257
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,778
From France.

1258
01:09:40,778 --> 01:09:42,195
France.

1259
01:09:43,343 --> 01:09:44,985
What's the fire spell?

1260
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,635
- Everything hurts.

1261
01:11:59,632 --> 01:12:00,882
Do you hear me?

1262
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:03,440
Everything hurts.

1263
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:15,162
- Hey.

1264
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:17,089
Where are they keys?

1265
01:12:17,089 --> 01:12:17,922
- Why?

1266
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,067
- Okay, can I have them, please?

1267
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:23,067
Why?

1268
01:12:24,464 --> 01:12:26,714
- Can I just have the keys?

1269
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:30,040
Why do you want them?

1270
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:30,910
- Do I need a reason?

1271
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,890
- Okay well, they're my keys so.

1272
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,290
Oh my god, okay.

1273
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,293
My leg hurts.

1274
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:37,680
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

1275
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,340
- The hospital?
- Mm hm.

1276
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:40,531
Okay, well can
you just wait until after-

1277
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:41,454
- Can you just give me the keys?

1278
01:12:41,454 --> 01:12:43,293
Can you just give her the keys.

1279
01:12:43,293 --> 01:12:44,696
- Listen, I'll drive.

1280
01:12:44,696 --> 01:12:46,244
Just give me the keys.

1281
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:47,894
- Don't leave me alone with them.

1282
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,700
Why is everyone screaming?

1283
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,640
Wren, can you take
Marissa to the hospital?

1284
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,473
- Why?

1285
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,787
I'm not that hungover.

1286
01:12:58,787 --> 01:13:00,770
Why can't you just do it?

1287
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:02,140
Because I'm managing the food.

1288
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,247
Ozzie, I mean I can-

1289
01:13:03,247 --> 01:13:04,510
- No.

1290
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,860
Oh, come on, Marissa.

1291
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,110
We're just about to start lunch.

1292
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:08,910
- I don't care about lunch, okay.

1293
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,210
I wanna go to the hospital
for my fucking leg.

1294
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,480
Can somebody just give
me some keys, please?

1295
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,350
One of their keys.

1296
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,183
Thank you.

1297
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,613
Be back later, I swear.

1298
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:34,583
- Hey guys, I'm really sorry.

1299
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,813
- Seriously, we try our
best to be welcoming to you.

1300
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,630
We could've had a good
time catching up with her,

1301
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:41,393
but we were warm to you, right?

1302
01:13:42,403 --> 01:13:43,480
- I don't know.

1303
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,480
- Arthur, forget it.

1304
01:13:47,661 --> 01:13:48,494
Okay?

1305
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,427
Let's just eat.

1306
01:13:57,423 --> 01:13:58,840
- Let's just eat.

1307
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,733
Hey.

1308
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,450
Is everything all right?

1309
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:13,283
- Yeah.

1310
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:18,650
Just gave me a bunch of antibiotics.

1311
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,180
Called me a dumb ass.

1312
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,773
Gave me this beautiful little patch.

1313
01:16:22,773 --> 01:16:25,293
Said it'll clear up in a few days so.

1314
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:27,939
- That's good.

1315
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:51,950
- Is there any food left?

1316
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,560
- Yeah.

1317
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,393
We made you a plate.

1318
01:16:54,393 --> 01:16:55,270
It's in the fridge.

1319
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,103
- Cool.

1320
01:16:58,110 --> 01:16:59,003
Thanks much.

1321
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,073
- I don't.

1322
01:17:19,704 --> 01:17:20,883
I don't get this.

1323
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,553
Fit in with you.

1324
01:17:29,496 --> 01:17:31,746
And I think that I want to.

1325
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:54,199
It's kite time, baby.

1326
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,313
Woo.

1327
01:17:56,279 --> 01:17:57,112
Here you go.

1328
01:17:57,112 --> 01:17:57,945
- Oh, those are for us?

1329
01:17:57,945 --> 01:17:58,778
Yes, they are.

1330
01:17:58,778 --> 01:18:00,278
- We get the bugs.
