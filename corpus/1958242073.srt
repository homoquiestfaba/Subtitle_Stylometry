1
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,304
<i>Since the beginning of time,</i>

2
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,141
<i>since the first little girl</i>
<i>ever existed,</i>

3
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,512
<i>there have been dolls.</i>

4
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,651
<i>But the dolls were always</i>
<i>and forever baby dolls.</i>

5
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,454
<i>The girls who played with them</i>

6
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,592
<i>could only ever play</i>
<i>at being mothers.</i>

7
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:35,329
<i>Which can be fun,</i>
<i>at least for a while, anyway.</i>

8
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,098
<i>Ask your mother.</i>

9
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,637
<i>This continued until...</i>

10
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,373
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>Barbie changed everything.</i>

11
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,343
<i>Then, she changed it all again.</i>

12
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,478
<i>All of these women are Barbie,</i>

13
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,883
<i>and Barbie is</i>
<i>all of these women.</i>

14
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,318
<i>She might have started out as</i>
<i>just a lady in a bathing suit,</i>

15
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,288
<i>but she became so much more.</i>

16
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,892
<i>She has her own money,</i>
<i>her own house,</i>

17
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:14,729
<i>her own car, her own career.</i>

18
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:19,667
<i>Because Barbie can be anything,</i>
<i>women can be anything.</i>

19
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,969
<i>And this has</i>
<i>been reflected back</i>

20
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:26,007
<i>onto the little girls of today</i>
<i>in the Real World.</i>

21
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,975
<i>Girls can grow into women,</i>

22
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,677
<i>who can achieve everything</i>

23
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,979
<i>and anything</i>
<i>they set their mind to.</i>

24

<i>Thanks to Barbie,</i>

25
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:40,387

108

In our assessment,
money is not speech,

109

and corporations have no free
speech rights to begin with.

110
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,938
So any claim on their part
to be exercising a right

111
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:20,708
is just their attempt
to turn our democracy
into a plutocracy.

00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,934
- Uh, Kens?
- It doesn't make sense.

173
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,368
-Why are you getting emotional?
-So you can beach yourself off!

174
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,804
Come on, Kens. Nobody's gonna
beach anyone off.

175
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,172
Okay?

176
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:06,273
Let's go.

177
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,742
-Okay, okay.
-Okay.

178
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,377
-You did so well.
-You still hurt?

179
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,712
We'll get you fixed up.

180
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,121
-Go!
-Go!

181
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:24,291
-Barbie, hold my hand!
-You're okay.

182
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,793
Stay with me, Barbie!

183
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,696
Great.

184
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,431
Not even broken.
You'll be fine.

185
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,933
Shredding waves is much more
dangerous than people realize.

186
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:33,901
You're very brave, Ken.

187
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,872
-Thank you, Barbie.
-Yeah.

188
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:39,940
-You know
surfer is not even my job.
-I know.

189
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:43,110
And it is not lifeguard,
which is
a common misconception.

190
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,312
-Very common.
-Because actually my job...

191
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,983
-...it's just beach.
-Right.

192
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,885
And what a good job
you do at beach.

193
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:52,286
You should heal up in no time.

194
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,888
Actually, in the time
that it took for me

195
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,389
to say that sentence,
you healed.

196
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,124
-Fantastic.
-Nice.

197
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,259
-Hey, Barbie.
-Yeah?

198
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,361
Can I come to your house
tonight?

199
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,029
- Sure. I don't have
anything big planned.
- Yes.

200
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,731
Just a giant blowout party
with all the Barbies

201
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,232
and planned choreography
and a bespoke song.

202
00:11:05,266 --> 00:11:06,800
You should stop by.

203
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,202
- So cool.
- Yeah.

204
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,904
-Okay. Bye.

00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,222
Oh, no.

341
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,191
Yes! So good!

342
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,164
Hey, Barbie.

343
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,567
-Hi.
-Are you okay?

344
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,868
-Hey, Barbie.
-Yeah, Barbie. I just fell.

345
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,636
-Fell?
-I'm so embarrassed.

346
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,370
-Barbie doesn't
get embarrassed.
-I know.

347
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,472
Barbie, I don't even
have context for this,

348
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:56,343
but my feet...
my heels are on the ground.

349
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,211
I'm no longer on tiptoes.

350
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,614
That's okay. Let me see.

351
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:06,286
Flat feet!

352
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:12,326
Oh, no!

353
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:16,163
Stop it, Ken.

354
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,799
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

355
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:19,366
I know I'm Stereotypical Barbie

356
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,902
and therefore
don't form conjectures

357
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,303
concerning the causality
of adjacent unfolding events,

358
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,506
but some things
have been happening
that might be related.

359
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,577
Bad breath this morning,
a cold shower,

360
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,178
burnt waffle,
and falling off my roof.

361
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,479
You're malfunctioning.

362
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,616
What? No, I'm just, I'm--

363
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,918
Am I?

364
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,587
I've never seen this kind
of malfunction before.
It's usually just hair-related.

365
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,489
You know, you're gonna have to
visit Weird Barbie.

366
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,892
I have never
had to visit Weird Barbie.

367
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:46,894
That's because
you've never malfunctioned.

368
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:50,197
I heard that she used to be
the most beautiful Barbie
of all,

369
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,433
but then someone
played with her too hard
in the Real World.

370
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,570
<i>♪ Colors of the world ♪</i>

371
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,604

00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:58,673

376
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,412
<i>♪ Shake it to the right ♪</i>

377
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,649
And now
she's fated to an eternity
of making other Barbies perfect

378
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,752
while falling more and more
into disrepair herself.

379
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:12,352
That, and we all call her
Weird Barbie

380
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,689
both behind her back
and also to her face.

381
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,256
She's so weird.

382
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,727
Why is she always
in the splits?

383
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,872
I would never
wear heels if my feet
were shaped this way.

384
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:35,743
Hello?

385
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:36,744
<i>Woof.</i>

386
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:37,679
Oh.

387
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,514
<i>Bark.</i>

388
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:41,716
<i>Woof.</i>

389
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,317
<i>Bark.</i>

390
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,419
Hey.

391
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,589
What's cookin',
good-lookin'?

392
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,390
-Hi.
-Welcome.

393
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,826
Welcome to my Weirdhouse.

394
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,298
-Hi, how are ya?
-Nice to meet you.

395
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,568
Sorry about the dog crap.
What can I do ya for?

396
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,871
I just had to come see you
about my feet.

397
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,338
They're, um...

398
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,648
-Flat.
-Yeah.

399
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,516
Never seen that before.

400
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,984
-Really?
-Whoa.

401
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,921
Okay. Well, can you,
you know, fix them?

402
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,388
You're Stereotypical Barbie,
right?

403
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,624
Mmm-hmm.

404
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,829
That Ken of yours,
he is one nice-looking
little protein pot.

405
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:30,031
I guess.

406
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:32,800
I'd like to see what kind
of nude blob he's packing
under those jeans.

407
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,670
-Anyway, what preceded this?
-Oh, nothing.

408
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:39,540
A really fun game
of volleyball.

409
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:42,442
-That's it?
-Thoughts of death.

410
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,443
What is it?

411
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,882
Maybe some thoughts
of death?

412
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,751
Thoughts of death!

413
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:51,853
-Is that a problem?
-Oh.

414
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,688
-What?
-I've heard of this.

415
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:56,624
Of course, I didn't think
it was possible, but it's real.

416
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,862
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal.

417
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,897
I didn't open a portal.

418
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,634
Someone did.
And now, there is a rip
in the continuum

419
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,570
that is the membrane between
Barbie Land and the Real World,

420
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:11,806
and if you wanna be
Stereotypical Barbie
perfect again,

421
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,775
then, baby girl,
you gotta go fix it.

422
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:17,745
Or you're gonna keep
going funny.
Look at your upper thigh.

423
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,814
- What is that?
- That's cellulite.

424
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,883
-That's gonna
spread everywhere.
-What?

425
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,819
And then you're gonna
start getting sad
and mushy and complicated.

426
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,353
No!

427
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,588
What do I have to do?

428
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,489
You have to go

429
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:31,092
-to the Real World.
-Okay.

430
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,360
And you have to find the girl
who's playing with you.

431
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,629
Playing with me?

432
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,396
We're all being played with,
babe.

433
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,465
But usually there's some kind
of separation. Thanks.

434
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,836
There's the girl and the doll.
And never the twain
shall cross.

435
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,771
-The twain is crossing?
-Yes.

436
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:45,907
And the girl who's playing
with you, she must be sad,

437
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,875
and her thoughts and feelings
and humanness

438
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,044
are interfering
with your dollness.

439
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,879
Why would she be sad?

440
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,715
We fixed everything so that
all women in the Real World

441
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,083
can be happy and powerful.

442
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:57,852
I don't know,
but if you ask me,

443
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,787
-you had something
to do with this, too.
-Me?

444
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:01,589
-Takes two to rip a portal.
-I can't have.

445
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:02,890
I've only ever wanted

446
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,826
for everything
to stay exactly as it is.

447
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,561
Well, be that as it may,

448
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,697
the two of you are becoming
inextricably intertwined.

449
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,732
And you gotta help her
to help yourself.

450
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:19,140
So, should-- Whoo!

451
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,775
So, what'll it be then?

452
00:22:20,808 --> 00:22:22,375
You can go
back to your regular life

453
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:23,945
and forget any of this
ever happened,

454
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:26,881
or you can know the truth
about the universe.

455
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:31,152
The choice is now yours.

456
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:32,987
The first one. The high heel.

457
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,990
No. We'll do a re-do.

458
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,124
You're supposed to
want to know.

459
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:38,593
I don't.

460
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,027
Mmm. Babe, listen.

461
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:41,896
You have to want to know, okay?
Do it again.

462
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,165
I'm not Adventure Barbie.
I'm Stereotypical Barbie.

463
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,700
I'm like the Barbie
you think of

464
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,434
when someone says,
"Think of a Barbie."

465
00:22:47,969 --> 00:22:49,804
That's me.

466
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:52,807
I'm bummed. You're a bummer.
That's a bummer.

467
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,876
Okay, I'm ready to forget now.

468
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:57,410
No! You're doing this one!

469
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:00,114
I just gave you a choice
so you could feel
some sense of control.

470
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,116
-So there is no option one?
-No!

471
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,485
You have to fix the rip
yourself.

472
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,188
Don't blame me, blame Mattel.
They make the rules.

473
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,456
Oh, I don't want to.

474
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,925
Fine, get cellulite.
I don't care.

475
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,160
No! No, no, no.
No. Okay. Yeah.

476
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,966
Send me through the portal.

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,568
Okay.
There's actually no portal.

478
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:21,969
-Oh.
-It's a figure of speech.

479
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:24,705
It's actually a sports car
to a speedboat,

480
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,474
to a rocket ship,
to a tandem bike,

481
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:30,011
to a camper van, fun,
to a snowmobile, brr,

482
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,579
which will take you
most of the way

483
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,080
to the state of Los Angeles,

484
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:35,082
where you will don neon
and Rollerblades,

485
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:37,652
and enter
the country of California.

486
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,887
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much.

487
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,623
And then when I get there,
how do I find this girl?

488
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,526
You will know.

489
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,795
Okay. And how do I get back?

490
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,697
The same way you came,
but in reverse.

491
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,600
Like I should move forward but
do the order backward or go--

492
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,602
-Don't overthink it.
-Oh. Okay.

493
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:58,839
For you see, if you do not
find her and fix things,

494
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,775
what's ugly will become uglier,

495
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,710
and what's weird
will become weirder.

496
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:04,612
And then you'll look like me.

497
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:05,813
Ahh! Oh.

498
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,716
Sorry.

499
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:10,918
I understand.
I set myself up for that.

500
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:13,187
-Anyway, I believe in you.
-Thank you.

501
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,057
Go. Be careful. I love you.

502
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,159
-Bye.
-Bye.

503
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:20,493
Bon voyage to reality,

504
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:23,164
and good luck
restoring the membrane

505
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:26,000
that separates
our world from theirs

506
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,102
so you don't get cellulite!

507
00:24:30,271 --> 00:24:32,773
-I guess she's going
without you.
-You're so lost, Ken.

508
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,209
She literally asked me.

509
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,578
And I was like,
"I prefer to stay here."

510
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,846
Why? Are you scared?

511
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,881
- No.
- I bet you're scared.

512
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:43,718
And I bet she doesn't
even want you to go.

513
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,252
Well, you bet
both those things incorrectly,

514
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,121
and I bet
in the opposite direction.

515
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,622
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

516
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:49,757
Which way is that?

517
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,793
You don't even know.

518
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,929
I just don't want to leave.
I'm trying to find reasons
not to leave.

519
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,097
Please stay.

520
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,898
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

521
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:00,001
I just wish someone could come
with me, but you can't.

522
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,235
I should do this alone.

523
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,803
-What bird am I thinking of?
-Parrot.

524
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:04,271
Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird.

525
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,173
Pelican.

526
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,842
-Ohh.
-Man.

527
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,877
We'll miss you, Barbie.

528
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,112
I'll be back in no time,
with perfect feet,

529
00:25:11,145 --> 00:25:13,214
and we'll forget
that this ever happened.

530
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,082
And you'll get to see
all the good work
we've done to fix the world.

531
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:16,917
You'll be such a hero to them.

532
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,819
All those grateful,
powerful women

533
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,088
who owe their wonderful lives
to Barbie.

534
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:23,190
I'll bet every woman
will say thank you

535
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,959
and give you a really big hug.

536
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:28,696
Yes, you're right. Here I go.

537
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,097
-Bye.
-Yay!

538
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:32,566
-Bye, Barbie.
-Bye.

539
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,237
Bye, Barbie.
Good luck in reality.

540
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,906

I'm coming with you.

00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:18,979
-No. Please get out.
-I can't.

551
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,714
I made a double bet with Ken,

552
00:26:20,748 --> 00:26:23,617
and you can't make me
look uncool in front of Ken.

553
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:24,952
Ken's not cool!

554
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,153
He is to me.

555
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:27,888
You're just gonna slow me down.

556
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:29,990
Barbie, what if there's beach?

557
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:32,059
You'll need someone
who's a professional in that.

558
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,664
Did you bring
your Rollerblades?

559
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,365
I literally go nowhere
without them.

560
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,136
-Please?
-Okay.

561
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,704
Wow.

00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,306
Let's do this.

563
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:46,774
-Can I sit in the front?
-No.

564
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,377

Yes!

576
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:40,761
Wow.
This is the Real World.

577
00:27:40,794 --> 00:27:43,097
Barbie, I told you
there'd be beach.

578
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,998
Yeah.

579
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:51,872
Hmm.

580
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:54,141
Oh, yeah!

581
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,311
What's going on?

582
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,313
Give us a smile, blondie.

583
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,349
Why are these men
looking at me?

584
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:04,084
Yeah, they're also
staring at me.

585
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:05,419
Ooh, love that!

586
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:07,021
Wow!

587
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,957
I feel kind of
ill at ease.
Like...

588
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,458
I don't know the word for it,
but I'm...

589
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:13,227
Nice leotard.

590
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,297
...conscious, but it's myself
that I'm conscious of.

591
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,898
I'm not getting
any of that.

592
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:20,100
I feel what could only
be described as admired.

593
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:22,136
- Damn, girl!
- But not ogled.

594
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,370
You're hot.

595
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,939
And there's no undertone
of violence.

596
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,908
Mine very much has
an undertone of violence.

597
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,476
Oh, look, a construction site.

598
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,412
We need
that good feminine energy.

599
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:33,847
-Yeah.
-Ladies! Yoo-hoo.

600
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,849
-Oh.
-You got fries with that shake?

601
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,818
If I said you had a hot body,
would you hold it against me?

602
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:39,119
Have I died
and gone to heaven?

603
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,988
Is that a mirror
in your pocket?

604
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,123
-Baby, you are an angel.
-I can see myself
in your shorts.

605
00:28:43,157 --> 00:28:44,892
I don't know exactly
what you meant
with all of those little quips,

606
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:46,860
but I'm picking up
on some sort of entendre,

607
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,429
which appears to be double,

608
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:50,097
and I would just like
to inform you,

609
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,367
I do not have a vagina.

610
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,469
And he does not have a penis.

611
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:57,304
We don't have genitals.

612
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,772
-That's okay.
-Yeah.

613
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:00,508
-Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
-It's cool.

614
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,043
I have all the genitals.

615
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:05,379
Geez, you would think
a construction site
at lunch time

616
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,781
would be the perfect place
for a little woman power,

617
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:11,852
but this one was so... male.

618
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,956
Everything is almost like...
reversed here.

619
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,326
Oh, look!

620
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,494
The Supreme Court.

621
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:22,296
- They're so smart.
- Yeah.

622
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,032
- Yeah, bruh!
- Do it, bro!

623
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,506
I love me a leotard.

624
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,207
I love the elbow pads.

625
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,276
I think we should get
some different clothes.

626
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,046
We look great.

627
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,548
-I love fringe.
-I love denim.

628
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:41,949
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

629
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:43,917
Hey, man.

630
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:46,086
You guys gotta pay
for that stuff.

631
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,391
She looks even better
in more clothes.

632
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,092
Because you can imagine more.

633
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:54,596
You know what? Keep 'em.

634
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,131
Weird Barbie said I would know
how to find this girl,

635
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:59,066
but I have no idea.

636
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,134
Hmm.

637
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,102
What would a smart Barbie do?

638
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,371
I just need to clear my mind
so I can think.

639
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:06,440
Who is playing with me?

640
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,442
I hate it when people think.
I get so bored.

641
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,878
Faster I figure it out,
the faster we get to go home.

642
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:13,113
-What am I supposed to do?
-Ken!

643
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,616
-Go for a walk or something.
-By myself?

644
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,250
-Yes.
-Really? Where?

645
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,484
Anywhere.

646
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,286
-Can I go that way?
-Yes. Okay.

647
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,561
-Don't go far.
-Okay!

648
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:32,399
Excuse me, sir.

649
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,069
Thanks, man.

650
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,247
What's up, man?

651
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:48,949
-We've got to man up
on this one.
-Great workout, man.

652
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:50,284
Men, men, men.

653
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:52,886
-You're the man!
-No, <i>you're</i> the man!

654
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,254
Men, men, men!

655
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:07,134
Based on the ROI,
we are exceeding expectations.

656
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,203
-Good stuff.
So I'm not worried about it.
-Excuse me--

657
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,305
Not now, Margaret.
Let's shake on this.

658
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,140
-We are gonna make
a lot of money.
-We are officially important.

659
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,997
Yes!

660
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,133
That felt...

661
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:49,537
...achy, but good.

662
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:00,414
- I'm actually trying
to make this work.

663
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:01,783
How?
By calling me a lunatic?

664
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,518
That's not
how you make things work.

665
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,686
I don't know what this is all--

666
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,693
You're so beautiful.

667
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:48,596
I know it.

668
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:58,205
Barbie! Barbie!

669
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,306
Yes!

670
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,240
I've got it!

671
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:01,375
Oh, what do you got?

672
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:02,677
-You go first.
-No, no, you go.

673
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,478
-We'll go at the same time.
-Okay.

674
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,346
-She's at school.
-Men rule the world!

675
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,215
-What was that?
-The kid's at the school?

676
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:09,249
But what did you say?

677
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:10,618
-Nothing.
-Okay.

678
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,620
-Well, let's go to the school.
-Okay!

679
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,154
Now, come on.

680
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:33,708
-Hello.
-This is Dan of the FBI.

681
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,442
Oh. This is Aaron at Mattel.

682
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,110
I don't give a flying squirrel
who you are, Aaron.

683
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,846
-What are you, like an intern?
-No, I'm--

684
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,548
Two of your dolls
have gotten loose.

685
00:34:40,582 --> 00:34:41,849
Impossible.

686
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,518
-How do you know?
-Don't sass me, Aaron.

687
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:45,485
Couple of blondes,
answering to Barbie and Ken.

688
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,187
Rollerblading in Santa Monica.

689
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,222
<i>We're gonna need Mattel's help</i>
<i>landing the eagle.</i>

690
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,625
<i>Don't crap the bed, Aaron!</i>

691
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:51,626
I won't.

692
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,330
This is bad.
This is really bad.

693
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,298
- What?
This happened before.

694
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,834
What? When?

695
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,869
I heard about ten years ago,
a woman named Skipper

696
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:03,771
turned up at some family's home
in Key West.

697
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,707
Asked to babysit the kids.

698
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,374
She then tried to take
their toddler surfing.

699
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,209
-Geez.
-I know.

700
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:10,143
They were able to straighten
it out, keep it under wraps,

701
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:13,213
but this is serious.

702
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,315
-I'm going all the way up.
-No one goes all the way up.

703
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,351
-I have to.
-You may never come back.

704
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,821
I know.

705
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:33,367
♪ Closer I am to fine

706
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,770
Oh.

707
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,639
-Hey.
-Oh, hi, Aaron.

708
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:39,239
-New drawings?
-Yeah.

709
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,909
I just started drawing
these weird designs.

710
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,477
These are different.

711
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:46,313
It's Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

712
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,415
Full Body Cellulite Barbie.

713
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,518
Crippling Shame Barbie.

714
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,453
Okay. Listen, I have to
speak to the top brass.

715
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:54,589
-No.
-I must.

716
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,724
-No.
-I'm going to.

717
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,359
Aaron, they're
in a big corporate idea sesh.
No one is to be admitted.

718
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,395
-Aaron! Aaron! Aaron, stop!
-...always be empowering girls.

719
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:02,897
Always!

720
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,666
But what do we really sell?
I'll tell you what.

721
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,299
- We sell dreams.
Aaron.

722
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,602
And imagination!

723
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,638
And sparkle!

724
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:12,707
I get excited. I'm passionate.

725
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,475
And when you think of sparkle,
what do you think of
after that?

726
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,711
Female agency.

727
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,781
Excuse me.

728
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:22,215
-Who are you?
-Aaron Dinkins, sir.

729
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:24,284
We're in the middle of a major
sit-down here, Aaron Dinkins.

730
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,887
I think you're gonna want
to hear this, sir.

731
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,723
Can you just e-mail it?
And you can send it to me EOD.

732
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:29,857
End of day.

733
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:31,793
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

734
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:35,295
May I put it
in a whisper, sir?

735
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,430
Fine. Whisper me.

736
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:00,755
No. No!

737
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:02,924
Ahh! Ahh! No.

738
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,424
- Get the chair!
- Take the cart.

739
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,425
They're okay.

740
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,563
-You all right?
-He's okay.

741
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:09,831
-Okay.
-He's okay.

742
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,036
It's a repeat
of Skipper in Key West.

743
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,806
And with all due respect,
that was Skipper, sir.

744
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,542
This is... Barbie.

745
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:25,613
If this got out

746
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,849
that our dolls were coming
to Los Angeles from Barbie Land

747
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:30,283
as life-size versions
of themselves...

748
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,320
roaming the earth...

749
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,624
this would be very bad.

750
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,860
Barbie in the Real World?

751
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,629
That's impossible.

752
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:43,865
We've got a definite situation
on our hands.

753
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:45,767
Catastrophic!

754
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,070
-I can't stress that enough!
-What?

755
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:51,005
-What's your name again?
-Aaron Dinkins, sir.

756
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,507
-Aaron Dickinson?
-Dinkins.

757
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,808
Yes! Aaron.

758
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,408
Is Barbie Land
like an alternate reality

759
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:57,912
or is it like a place
where your imagination--

760
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,013
Yes!

761
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,648
Okay.

762
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:03,718
Think of it as a town
in Sweden, Aaron Dinkins.

763
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,019
Sweden.

764
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:06,587
Right.

765
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,690
How much do you weigh?

766
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:11,759
It doesn't matter.

767
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,360
Sounds like a job for the box.

768
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:18,065
No one rests until this doll
is back in a box.

769
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,835
Look, Davy Crockett
Junior High School,

770
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,036
just like I saw in my vision.

771
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,638
A man on a horse.

772
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,438
I've started to get all these
weirdo feelings.

773
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,375
Like, I have fear
with no specific object.

774
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,343
-What is that?
-It's anxiety.

775
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,647
I have it too.
They're just awful at this age.

776
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,381
I feel amazing.

777
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,584
That's because kids don't
take it out on the dads.

778
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,820
She's gotta
be here somewhere.

779
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,087
I need to find her soon.

780
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,989
I'm just gonna pop
into the library

781
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,691
and see if I can find
any books on trucks.

782
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,059
Okay, just don't
get in trouble.

783
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,662
I won't!

784
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:50,430
<i>- ♪ Johnny, my baby, did it</i>

What are you doing?

789
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,812
Oh, uh,
what's that girl's name?

790
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,147
That's Sasha.

791
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,447
Hey, Sasha!

792
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,382
-Don't talk to her.
-Oh.

793
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,519
Sasha can talk to you,
but you can
never talk to Sasha.

794
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,688
-She'll crush you.
-Don't worry.

795
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:15,890
Everyone really likes me
and thinks I'm cool and pretty.

796
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,859
Huh.

797
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:18,893
Thank you.

798
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:25,633
Hey, ladies. Sasha, what's up?

799
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:29,402
Who are you?

800
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:35,610
I'm only your favorite woman
of all time.

801
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,477
Barbie!

802
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:41,182
You really think you're Barbie?

803
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,884
-Yeah.
-She's crazy.

804
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:44,752
Do you think she escaped
from like an insane asylum?

805
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,621
So you're like "Barbie" Barbie?
Like a professional bimbo?

806
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,089
No. Barbie's not a bimbo.

807
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,457
Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer
and a senator

808
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,059
and a Nobel Prize winner.

809
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,794
You're a Nobel Prize winner?

810
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:57,531
Oh. No, not me,
but Barbie is.

811
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,466
Yeah.

812
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,603
Aren't you guys gonna thank me
and give me a big hug?

813
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:06,473
For being your favorite toy?

814
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:09,476
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were
like five years old.

815
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,444
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

816
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:13,480
I mean, I'd play with Barbie,
but it was, like,
the last resort.

817
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:14,749
I loved Barbie.

818
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,751
Oh.

819
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,053
Anyways, even then,
it was horrible for us.

820
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,154
It was horrible?

821
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:22,990
Why?

822
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,225
-Come on, Sasha.
-Give it to her.

823
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:25,826
Destroy Barbie.

824
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:30,598
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

825
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:33,834
You've been making women
feel bad about themselves
since you were invented.

826
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,703
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

827
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:38,139
You represent everything wrong
with our culture.

828
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,676
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

829
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,912
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

830
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:47,915
Barbie is so much more
than that.

831
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,151
Look at yourself.

832
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,120
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

833
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:55,756
You set the feminist movement
back 50 years.

834
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,825
You destroy
girls' innate sense of worth

835
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,527
and you are killing the planet

836
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,562
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

837
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:05,766
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy
and powerful.

838
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,635
Oh, I am powerful.

839
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:09,770
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

840
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,106
I hadn't thought about you
in years, you fascist!

841
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,112
Oh. Um...

842
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,614
Okay.

843
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,017
It's happening again.
I have to--

844
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,885
Will you excuse me?

845
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,154
It was really nice
talking to you.

846
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,863
They never listen.

847
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,579
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

848
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,814
You respect me.

849
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,850
Sorry, no,
do you know what time it is?

850
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,119
No, I do not.

851
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,022
Okay.

852
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,623
Why didn't Barbie tell me
about patriarchy,

853
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:03,991
which, to my understanding,

854
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,627
is where men and horses
run everything?

855
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,062
Sure.

856
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,897
I shall seek my fortune there.

857
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,933
All right. So...

858
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:15,669
I'll take a high-level,
high-paying job
with influence, please.

859
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,971
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

860
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,606
And a lot of our people
have PhDs.

861
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,074
Isn't being a man enough?

862
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,842
Actually, right now,
it's kind of the opposite.

863
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,779
You guys are clearly not doing
patriarchy very well.

864
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,848
No!
No. We're, uh...

865
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:31,252
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just... hide it better now.

866
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:33,187
Oh.

867
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,757
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

868
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,159
-But I'm a man.
-But not a doctor.

869
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,894
-Please?
-No.

870
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,328
-Can I talk to a doctor?
-You are talking to a doctor.

871
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,897
-Can you get me a coffee?
-No.

872
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,964
-And I need a clicky pen.
-No.

873
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,066
-And a white coat.
-No.

874
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,734
-And a sharp thing.
-No.

875
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,035
-There he is. Doctor!
-Somebody get security.

876
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,237
I'd like to apply
for your job of beach.

877
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,906
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

878
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,375
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

879
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,710
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

880
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,345
There's nobody in danger here.

881
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,781
And even if there were,
I'm not trained to save them.

882
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:02,083
Then I can't hire you.

883
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:04,018
I can't even beach here!

884
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,724
She thinks I'm a fascist?

885
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:14,862
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

886
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,666
-There you are.
-Oh, no.

887
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,367
That went terrible.

888
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:23,904
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

889
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,776
Miss Barbie?

890
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,144
It's just Barbie.

891
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,912
We're gonna need you
to come with us.

892
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:33,914
Oh.

893
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,716
-Who are you?
-We're Mattel.

894
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:37,418
-Mattel?
-Mattel.

895
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,220
Oh, thank goodness!

896
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,255
I've gotta talk
to somebody in charge.

897
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,857
Everything is backwards here.

898
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,725
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

899
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,327
Girls hate me.

900
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,662
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

901
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:49,930
Need you to step this way,
ma'am.

902
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,699
I also just learned to cry.

903
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,801
First, I got one tear
and then I got a whole bunch.

904
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,402
What do I do?
Do I follow Barbie

905
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:58,172
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

906
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:01,075
A truck car
I'd like to have, actually.

907
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:04,078
You're right, she's fine.
It's Mattel.

908
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:06,247
- Yeah.
- I know.

909
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,149
I'll go back to Barbie Land,
and I'll tell the Kens
what I've learned.

910
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,383
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

911
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,986
Okay.

912
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,220
-Back to Barbie Land.
-Let's go that way.

913
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:16,690
-Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
-Don't call me that.

914
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,293
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

915
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,096
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

916
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,732
Thank God
they arrested that nutjob.

917
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:25,933
Um, um...

918
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:28,135
that reality-challenged woman.

919
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,336
She thinks she's Barbie.

920
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,071
Wait, what did you say?

921
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,908
She thinks she's Barbie.
She's, like, fully convinced.

922
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,211
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

923
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:38,913
Mom. Mom!

924
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,849
Mom, get back in the car!

925
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:45,052
Are you kidding me?

926
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:47,821
Mom!

927
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:53,460
Mattel! Of course it was
you guys that brought me here.

928
00:44:53,494 --> 00:44:56,764
Because it definitely wasn't
that Sasha girl.

929
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:59,033
Thanks for the ride.
This has been so much fun.

930
00:44:59,066 --> 00:45:02,203
Wow, the mothership!

931
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:09,310
-Barbie!
-We're so happy to see you.

932
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,478
- Hi!
-  -Would you like some mineral water?

933
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:12,947
Yes, thank you.

934
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,215
Oh, thanks.

935
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,919
I'm not used to that
having anything in it.

936
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,992
Thank you.

937
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:27,061
So, we've been very anxious
to get some quality
face-time with you.

938
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:28,530
Of course.
So what can I do

939
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:30,931
to repair the rift
in the space-time continuum,

940
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:32,833
get my feet back,
and that one cellulite gone,

941
00:45:32,866 --> 00:45:35,369
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

942
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:38,806
We have been discussing
that very topic.

943
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:41,308
If you're agreeable to it,
we would love it

944
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:44,979
if you could just get
into that giant box.

945
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:49,950
Get into the box and you'll go
back to Barbie Land.

946
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:52,353
And everything will be
as it was.

947
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:54,955
You know what? We should
probably get Ken first.

948
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:56,123
Ken?

949
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:57,191
Ken.

950
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:58,560
You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken.

951
00:45:58,593 --> 00:46:00,127
Oh!

952
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,396
-Yes, Ken. Yeah.
-Ken. The guy. Yeah.

953
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:07,502
Back to Barbie Land!

954
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:10,070
- I'm gonna be sick.
- I'm gonna be sick.

955
00:46:10,104 --> 00:46:12,873
Ken isn't something
we're worried about.

956
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:15,342
Ever.

957
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,444
Okay, I'll just, um...
I'll get in the box then.

958
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:18,812
All right! Yes!

959
00:46:20,147 --> 00:46:22,449
Oh. But since I came
all this way,

960
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:24,451
could I just meet
the woman in charge,

961
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,453
your CEO?

962
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:28,088
Oh, that would be me.

963
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,390
-Oh. Your CFO.
-Me.

964
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:30,924
-Your COO.
-Here.

965
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,092
President
of the Barbie division.

966
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:33,360
-Present.
-I'm a man with no power.

967
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:35,496
Does that make me a woman?

968
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,965
Are any women in charge?

969
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:41,435
Listen, I know exactly
where you're going with this,

970
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,138
and I have to say
I really resent it.

971
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:47,007
We are a company
literally made of women.

972
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,443
We had a woman CEO in the '90s.

973
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,378
And there was another one...

974
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:55,115
at some other time.

975
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:59,353
So that's--
that's two right there.

976
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:03,525
Women are the freaking
foundation of this very long

977
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:05,292
phallic building.

978
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:08,162
We have
gender-neutral bathrooms
up the wazoo.

979
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:11,098
Every single one of these men
love women.

980
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm the son of a mother.

981
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:15,336
I'm the mother of a son.

982
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,106
I'm... I'm the nephew
of a woman aunt.

983
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,908
Some of my best friends
are Jewish.

984
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,144
What I'm trying to say is...

985
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,047
Get in the box, you Jezebel!

986
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,617
What? I can't say Jezebel now?

987
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:32,419
I haven't been
in a box in ages.

988
00:47:32,453 --> 00:47:33,987
See? It's easy.

989
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:36,957
Oh, okay.

990
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,492
Huh.

991
00:47:38,526 --> 00:47:41,161
Oh, my gosh.
I remember this smell.

992
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,297
I'm having a real
Proustian flashback.

993
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,101
Remember Proust Barbie?
That did not sell very well.

994
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,008
Oh! Ha-ha!

995
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,244
You know what?
Um, before I get in the box,

996
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:58,513
could I just run
to the restroom

997
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,280
and make sure
my hair is perfect?

998
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:02,650
-Fine. Can you
be speedy about it?
-Mmm-hmm.

999
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:05,653
-Down this way?
-It's just down the hallway.

1000
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,354
- Thank you.
- On the right.

1001
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,661
I guess she really
had to go to the bathroom.

00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,471
Don't worry. You're safe here.

1029
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:33,575
What is this place?

1030
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:38,212
I always find
I think best at kitchen tables.

1031
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:42,449
Tea?

1032
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:45,219
Uh, yes, please.

1033
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:52,292
So a woman does work here.

1034
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,395
Oh, sweetie,
we do more than work here.

1035
00:50:02,837 --> 00:50:04,238
Thank you.

1036
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,260
What?

1037
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,462
It's because I don't know
how to drink tea?

1038
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:32,165
No. You look different.

1039
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,770
Oh. It's not
how I normally look.
I usually look perfect.

1040
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:38,806
Oh, I don't know.

1041
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,141
I think you're just right.

1042
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:50,752
Real World isn't
what I thought it was.

1043
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,453
It never is.

1044
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,322
And isn't that marvelous?

1045
00:50:57,124 --> 00:51:00,127
Who are you?

1046
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,229
Which way did she go?
Who saw her last?

1047
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,364
Uh, if you go
through that closet,

1048
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,433
you'll find a stairwell
down to the lobby.

1049
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:08,402
- Find her!
- Okay.

1050
00:51:11,438 --> 00:51:13,440
Thank you, um...

1051
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:16,578
Ruth.

1052
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:18,245
Ruth. Thank you, Ruth.

1053
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:21,281
You're welcome, Barbie.

00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:42,804
Oh! Uh, key card!

1061
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:45,205
-Wait.
-I don't have
my key card.

1062
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:47,909
Get in!

1063
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,650
Now! Get in now!

1064
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:58,920
- Come on.
- Oh!

1065
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:00,888
Ahh!

1066
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:02,690
Okay.

1067
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:04,926
- Oh, no! Now we're never
gonna get Barbie!

1068
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:06,360
Oh, we didn't need it!

1069
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,261
Barbie!

1070
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,598
Let's form a plan here.

1071
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:13,901
I would normally have shotgun.
I'll go in the first one.

1072
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,202
<i>Hang on.</i>

1073
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:18,640
Ahh!

1074
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:19,907
God, I hope
nobody from school saw us

1075
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,175
put a life-size Barbie
in our car.

1076
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:23,443
- How did this even happen?
-  -I don't know.

1077
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,278
How are you here?
You're like an idea.

1078
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,614
A great idea.

1079
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:29,216
So, I've been
a little lonely lately.

1080
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,251
And I found those Barbies
we used to play with--

1081
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:32,920
-I thought we gave those away.
-Well, I started playing
with them.

1082
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:35,422
And making drawings
like we used to do.
Remember?

1083
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,791
Because I thought
it would be joyful.

1084
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,325
-Was it?
-No, it wasn't.

1085
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,727
I got sad and weird,

1086
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:41,663
and then the drawings
got sad and weird,

1087
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:44,197
and maybe
because I couldn't be like you,

1088
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:45,600
I ended up making you like me.

1089
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:48,970
Did any of these drawings
by chance

1090
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:51,739
have thoughts
of death and cellulite?

1091
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:54,709
Yes! Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

1092
00:52:54,742 --> 00:52:57,244
-Oh, my God!
-And Cellulite!

1093
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:03,350
-I came for you!
-You came for me!

1094
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:05,252
Those were <i>your</i> memories.

1095
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:34,849
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1096
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,719
Hello? Are you two,
like, shining?

1097
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:39,520
No! No, it's nothing like that.

1098
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:42,523
-Are you shining
with a real Barbie?
-No!

1099
00:53:42,557 --> 00:53:44,424
I mean, maybe.
Like a little, yes.

1100
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,027
I don't even know
where to start

1101
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,962
with this
wishing-a-Barbie-to-life crap.

1102
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:50,263
Oh, Sasha, listen.

1103
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:52,567
I'm just a boring mom
with a boring job
and a daughter who hates me.

1104
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,769
Can you blame me for wanting
to have a little fun?

1105
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,505
I gotta lose
these chuckleheads.

1106
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,307
Ahh!

1107
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,341
Mom!

1108
00:54:03,578 --> 00:54:05,345
I think I owe you ladies
an apology.

1109
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:07,915
I thought that Barbie
had made the Real World better,

1110
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:10,752
but the Real World is forever
and irrevocably messed up!

1111
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:13,755
Well, the Real World
is not perfect,
but you inspired me.

1112
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:18,325
I love women.
I want to help women.

1113
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,794
Oh, come off it,
everybody hates women.

1114
00:54:19,827 --> 00:54:21,328
Women hate women,
and men hate women.

1115
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,563
It's the one thing
we can all agree on.

1116
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:24,031
-Is that true?
-It's complicated.

1117
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,733
-Hate is a strong word.
-Wake up, Mom!

1118
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,436
- I am wide awake,
Sasha!

1119
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:35,743
Mom, where did you learn
to drive like this?

1120
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,311
-There was this guy.
-Was it Dad?

1121
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:40,313
Yeah, yeah, it was...
It was Dad.

1122
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,669
Okay, duck.

1123
00:55:01,702 --> 00:55:03,070
You look so pretty.
- Don't look at me.

1124
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:04,304
Okay, sorry.

1125
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,478
I can't hold them off forever.
Where can we go?

1126
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:14,982
Wait, I have an idea.
Can you get us to Venice Beach?

1127
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:16,551
Sure can.

1128
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:19,120
Ah! I love Rollerblades.
Where are we going?

1129
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,988
- Barbie Land.
- What? Mom!

1130
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,857
Are you really gonna let Barbie

1131
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,492
take you
and your tween daughter
to an imaginary land?

1132
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:27,728
Yes, and you wanna know why?
Because I never
get to do anything.

1133
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:29,997
I didn't even go on that cruise
I won at your school raffle

1134
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,033
because I didn't have
enough vacation days
and your dad's allergic to sun.

1135
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:34,434
-Oh.
-What about Dad?
We can't just leave him!

1136
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:35,903
He'll be fine.

1137
00:55:35,937 --> 00:55:37,138
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1138
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,506
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1139
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:39,707
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

1140
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:42,777
Yeah, yeah. He'll be fine.

1141
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,078
Ready for fun?

1142
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:45,478
-Yes!
-Great!

1143
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:47,849
Here we go!

1144
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:49,617
Come on and feel the magic.

1145
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,719
Where are we?

1146
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,054
How did we get
into these clothes?

1147
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,622
How did we get
into this vehicle?

1148
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,389
When I was a kid,
I lost these boots

1149
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,425
and my mom wouldn't let me
buy a whole new Barbie

1150
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,760
just to replace the boots.

1151
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:01,562
-They look so good on you.
-Why, thank you.

1152
00:56:01,596 --> 00:56:03,664
-Hey, you!
-She was always
my favorite Barbie.

1153
00:56:03,698 --> 00:56:04,999
You're my favorite human.

1154
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:07,768
Don't tell him,
but I never got a Ken.

1155
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,804
That's because Ken
is totally superfluous.

1156
00:56:09,837 --> 00:56:11,873
I didn't say that.

1157
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:14,876
Women hold
all major positions of power,
control all the money.

1158
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:16,677
Basically, everything
that men do in your world,

1159
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:17,879
women do in ours.

1160
00:56:17,912 --> 00:56:19,180
I mean,
that sounds kind of cool.

1161
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,816

1166
00:56:30,524 --> 00:56:32,093
Oh, and we have
a female president

1167
00:56:32,126 --> 00:56:35,029
and it's fun and work
and friendship and female 24/7.

1168
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:37,064
Do giant hands come in
and play with you?

1169
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:38,766
No, that's crazy.

1170
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,168
Excuse me. Have you seen
a group of women on wheels?

1171
00:56:41,202 --> 00:56:42,803
Actually, yeah,

1172
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:44,038
there was a blonde,
a brunette and a tween.

1173
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,072
They Rollerbladed
in that direction.

1174
00:56:45,106 --> 00:56:46,841
Oh, no.

1175
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:49,010
First step
is always Rollerblading.

1176
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:50,111
Excuse me, sir?

1177
00:56:50,144 --> 00:56:52,479
They've gone to Barbie Land.

1178
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,181
-Oh, no.
-And she's brought humans
there with her.

1179
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,183
This could mean extremely
weird things for our world.

1180
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:57,785
Like what?

1181
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:59,486
Nothing any of our collective
imaginations

1182
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,655
could ever dream up.

1183
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:04,025
A podcast
hosted by two wise trees.

1184
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:07,561
Or a choir
of 2,000 young fathers.

1185
00:57:07,595 --> 00:57:10,231
Not even close.
We've got to
get to Barbie Land.

1186
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:14,702
Go! Find some blades now!
Just pick a direction and run!

1187
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:18,539
I can practically feel
my heels lifting already. Yes!

1188
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:21,242
This is what I was supposed
to do. Bring you back here.

1189
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,476
-It feels right.
-It does.

1190
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:25,146
Okay, this is...

1191
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,615

So, that's our president,

1196
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:45,066
And the cheering squad
is the Supreme Court.

00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:48,169
This is so much better
than being president.

1198
00:57:48,202 --> 00:57:50,604
Something's weird today.

1199
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:52,039
Hi, Barbie!

1200
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:54,976
Oh, okay. Hi, Ken.

1201
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:59,613
-Have a brewski beer.
My big guy is thirsty.
-Ah.

1202
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,717
Anyway, uh...

1203
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,285
Wait until you see
my Dreamhouse.

1204
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:06,887
Everything I've bought and own
will totally inspire you.

1205
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:08,488
And we can
change clothes again!

1206
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,194
- That's the Capitol.
- Ah!

1207
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:14,929
-It's pink?
-Pink!

1208
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:16,163
And that's the--

1209
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:20,301
♪ <i>You think</i>
<i>That women rule the world♪</i>

1210
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:23,237
These are the Dreamhouses.
This is where I live.

1211
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,306
You can see
through the houses.

1212
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:27,641
So does each Barbie, like,
have their own house?

1213
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:29,276
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's cool.

1214
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:30,878
Where do the Kens stay?

1215
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:33,547
I don't know.

1216
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:36,050
At first I thought
the Real World was run by men.

1217
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,585
And then there was a minute

1218
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:40,187
where I thought
it was run by horses.

1219
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:43,224
But then I realized that horses
are just men extenders.

1220
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:45,760
- Oh!
- Hmm?

1221
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:47,728
Oh. I had that treehouse.

1222
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:49,830
I saved up my allowance
to buy it.

1223
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:54,335
I've never seen a car like that before.
 What happened here?

1224
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:57,104
Everything,
basically everything exists

1225
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:59,974
to expand and elevate
the presence of men.

1226
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:01,909
-That's amazing.
-That's beautiful.

1227
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:03,210
- I know.
- Barbie's here.

1228
00:59:03,244 --> 00:59:04,345
Uh-oh.

1229
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:07,615
Ken?

1230
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:09,617
What have you done?

1231
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,153
What are you wearing?

1232
00:59:12,186 --> 00:59:15,122
Don't question it.
Just roll with it, tiny baby.

1233
00:59:15,156 --> 00:59:17,091
- Tiny baby.
- Don't call me baby.

1234
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,093
What about mini-baby?
Like this mini-fridge.

1235
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:21,829
No, Ken.

1236
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:25,132
This is my Dreamhouse.
It is my Dreamhouse! It's mine!

1237
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,201
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dreamhouse.

1238
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:32,873
This shall henceforth be known
as Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1239
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:34,875
You don't have to say dojo
and house.

1240
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,243
And casa...

1241
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:38,279
But you do
because it feels good. Try it.

1242
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:40,681
- Mojo Dojo Casa--
- No, girls. Don't say it.

1243
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:42,750
Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1244
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:46,053
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

1245
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:49,056
Whoa, boss,
these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses

1246
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,292
are literally flying
off the shelves.

1247
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:55,663
The kids are clamoring
for them.
Ken is on T-shirts, mugs.

1248
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:57,798
- It's the number one tattoo.
- Oh, no.

1249
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:00,768
Warner Bros. have started
auditions for the Ken movie,

1250
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:04,705
which is already
a blockbuster hit.

1251
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,373
It's happening. That thing
we could never imagine.

1252
01:00:06,407 --> 01:00:07,975
If we don't get
my words lady...

1253
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,944
-Executive Assistant.
-My Executive Words Lady

1254
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,245
and someone
who's probably her daughter

1255
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:12,780
back here and close the portal,

1256
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:14,215
our worlds could be altered
forever.

1257
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:16,117
Well, what does it matter
if it's Barbie or Ken?

1258
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,418
The money is pouring in.

1259
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,820
Shame on you,
Executive Number Two.

1260
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:21,922
You think I spent
my entire life in boardrooms

1261
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:23,057
because of a bottom line?

1262
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,658
No! I got into this business

1263
01:00:24,692 --> 01:00:26,894
because of little girls
and their dreams.

1264
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:29,130
In the least creepy way
possible.

1265
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:32,133
Now, blade faster.
Time is running out.

1266
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,802
Look, I'm just having
some brewski beers

1267
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:37,071
at my Mojo Dojo Casa House.

1268
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:38,772
Ken!

1269
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:40,307
You can stay if you want,

1270
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,076
as my bride wife,

1271
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:44,778
or my long-term-low-
commitment-distance girlfriend.

1272
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,247
-What do you say?
-Ugh.

1273
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:48,349
Brewski beer me?

1274
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:51,218
I will not brewski beer you.

1275
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:53,854
Ha-ha-ha. That's fine.

1276
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,723
You know, now that
you Barbies aren't around
to run everything,

1277
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:57,158
we can do our hair
however we like.

1278
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:58,459
I have hats.

1279
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,929
Where are my hungry boys?
Who wants snacks?

1280
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:03,931
Barbie,
I am so happy to see you.

1281
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:05,132
Can you believe
what is happening?

1282
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,834
I know. Isn't it great?

1283
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:09,303
Anyone need a brewski beer?

1284
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:12,039
What are you doing?
You're a doctor.

1285
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:13,941
I like being
a helpful decoration.

1286
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,844
And Allan likes to help me give
all the Kens foot massages.

1287
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,078
No, I don't, I don't like that.

1288
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,047
We love it.

1289
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,315
-Ugh, so gross.
-I'm so blotto-faced
day-drunk right now.

1290
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:24,285
Ditto same-same that.

1291
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:25,886
I like not having to make
any decisions.

1292
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,222
It's like a spa day
for my brain. Forever.

1293
01:01:28,255 --> 01:01:30,090
What is wrong with them?

1294
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:31,458
We just explained to them
the immaculate,

1295
01:01:31,492 --> 01:01:33,127
impeccable seamless
garment of logic

1296
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,762
that is patriarchy,
and they crumbled.

1297
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,964
Oh, my God.
This is like in the 1500s

1298
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,799
with the indigenous people
and smallpox.

1299
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,234
They had no defenses
against it.

1300
01:01:40,267 --> 01:01:43,437
Yeah. Buckle up, babe.

1301
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:46,907
Because Barbie Land
is now Ken Land.

1302
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:49,410
And it's gonna be just like
Century City in Los Angeles,

1303
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:52,813
because they had it all
figured out in Century City.

1304
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:55,149
The minute you get
out of your car, you're like,

1305
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:57,851
"I can't believe
how great this place is!"

1306
01:01:57,885 --> 01:02:00,254
No, no, no. They don't have it
figured out in Century City

1307
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:02,356
because we failed them.

1308
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,758
No! You failed me!

1309
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:13,100
Out there, I was somebody.

1310
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:16,870
And when I walked
down the street...

1311
01:02:19,006 --> 01:02:21,809
people respected me
just for who I am.

1312
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:28,782
One lady, she even
asked me for the time.

1313
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:29,551
No way!

1314
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,151
Way.

1315
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:35,356
And if it weren't
for these technicalities

1316
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:37,925
like MBAs, medical degrees,

1317
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:42,997
and I don't know,
swim lessons, I could
have ruled that world.

1318
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,498
But I don't need
any of those things here.

1319
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:54,108
Here, I'm just a dude.
And you know what?

1320
01:02:58,412 --> 01:02:59,446
That's enough.

1321
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,881
TV remote.

1322
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:06,453
Which one is it?

1323
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:08,322
Oh, it's that one right there.

1324
01:03:10,424 --> 01:03:11,959
<i>Call me</i>
<i>Mister Ken President</i>
<i>Prime Minister, ma'am.</i>

1325
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:13,327
<i>Let's recap</i>
<i>all the amazing changes</i>

1326
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,895
<i>and innovations</i>
<i>thanks to the Kens.</i>

1327
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:17,331
<i>The Nobel Prize</i>
<i>in horses goes to...</i>

1328
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,033
<i>Ken!</i>

1329
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:21,101
<i>Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!</i>

1330
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:25,406
<i>Wow. And now</i>
<i>you're making it permanent</i>

1331
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,442
<i>with a special election</i>
<i>to change the Constitution.</i>

1332
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:29,977
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>In just 48 hours,</i>

1333
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,979
<i>all the Kens will head</i>
<i>to the polls</i>

1334
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:33,515

<i>to a government</i>

1335
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:36,016
<i>for the Kens, of the Kens,</i>
<i>and by the Kens!</i>

1336
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,057
You can't do this.

1337
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:44,526
This is Barbie Land.

1338
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,561
The Barbies worked hard
and they dreamed hard

1339
01:03:46,594 --> 01:03:49,463
to make it
everything that it is. You--

1340
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:52,933
You can't just
undo it in a day.

1341
01:03:52,966 --> 01:03:55,169
Literally and figuratively,
watch me.

1342
01:03:56,236 --> 01:04:00,407
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1343
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:04,546
this is my Mojo Dojo
Casa House, it's not

1344
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:07,549
Barbie's Mojo Dojo
Casa House.

1345
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,184
Right?

1346
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:15,956
How's that feel?

1347
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,563
It is not fun, is it?

1348
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:26,033
It's boys' night!

1349
01:04:41,315 --> 01:04:43,083
Every night is boys' night.

1350
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:50,257
Go, Ken! Go, Ken! Go, Ken!

1351
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:59,701
Barbie! Take your
lady fashions with you.

1352
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:03,237
Take your Celebrate Disco
Bell Bottoms...

1353
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:04,972
Oh!

1354
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,408
...and your Ice Capades
Pretty Practice Suit

1355
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:09,143
and Dazzling Show Skirt.

1356
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,044
These are archival.

1357
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,648
Your Pajama Jam
in Amsterdam sets.

1358
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:15,182
No!

1359
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:17,418
And your Pretty Paisley
Palazzo Pants!

1360
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:21,689
-Not the Palazzos!
-And get out!

1361
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,427
Maybe this could fit me.

1362
01:05:29,597 --> 01:05:31,198
Honey.

1363
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,300
Why did you wish me
to your messed-up world

1364
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:37,371
using your complicated
human thoughts and feelings?

1365
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:40,441
-What?
-Barbie Land
was perfect before.

1366
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:44,311
I was perfect before.

1367
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:48,015
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't trying to do anything.

1368
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,216
Don't apologize.

1369
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,553
Don't blame my mom.

1370
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:53,353
Aw, Sasha,
that's sweet.

1371
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:56,423
Maybe you wished us.
Maybe it's your fault, Barbie.

1372
01:05:56,457 --> 01:05:57,692
No,
I didn't wish anything.

1373
01:05:57,725 --> 01:06:01,061
I've never wanted
anything to change.

1374
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:06,300
Oh, honey, that's life.
It's all change.

1375
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:08,636
That's...

1376
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,370
That's terrifying.

1377
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:15,610
I don't want that.

1378
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,714
Not my life. No, thank you.

1379
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:23,183
Just, no, I don't want this.

1380
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:32,226
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait and hope

1381
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:35,062
that one of the more
leadership-oriented Barbies

1382
01:06:35,095 --> 01:06:37,064
just snaps out of it

1383
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:39,066
and does something
about this whole mess.

1384
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,603
I really understand
this feeling.

1385
01:06:41,636 --> 01:06:44,706
It's basically, like, being
a human person all the time--

1386
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:47,040
Please just leave me here.
Just leave me.

1387
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:50,812
Go back to your messed-up world
and just leave me to mine.

1388
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:53,213
- So, you're just gonna give up?
- Yes.

1389
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,486
Okay.

1390
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,154
You know,
I almost feel bad for you,

1391
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,625
but you are exactly
what I thought you were.

1392
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:05,793
Um...

1393
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,796
Let's go, honey. Let's just...

1394
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,230
Okay, how do we--
how do you expect--

1395
01:07:10,264 --> 01:07:11,633
Do everything we did
in reverse.

1396
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:17,539
Unbelievable. Come on, Mom.
She doesn't deserve you.

1397
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:25,479
This is the lowest
I've ever been.

1398
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:28,282
Emotionally and physically.

1399
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:30,852
<i>Okay, kids,</i>

1400
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,386
<i>it's time to run out</i>

1401
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:33,855

1402
01:07:33,888 --> 01:07:35,790
<i>She wears sweatpants</i>
<i>all day and night.</i>

1403
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:38,191
<i>She spent seven hours today</i>

1404
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,460

1405
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:42,664

1406
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:44,666

1407
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:47,602

1412
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:01,749
Barbie.
Barbie, wake up.

1413
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:02,784
- Hey.
<i>- Weird.</i>

1414
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:05,753
I'm like you now.

1415
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:07,755
Ugly and unwanted.

1416
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:09,657
Thanks.

1417
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:12,326
Let's get her in the back.
Come on.

1418
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:13,360
One, two...

1419
01:08:14,696 --> 01:08:15,697
- Isn't this great?
- Yes.

1420
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,397
Wait until you see the boat.

1421
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:18,666
The boat.

1422
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,836
Beautiful

1434
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:03,678
-Who are you?
-I'm Allan.

1435
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:05,546
Oh, you are Allan.
That's great.

1436
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,447
Don't tell the Kens.
I'm trying to escape.

1437
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,282
I cannot sit
on one more leather couch.

1438
01:09:09,316 --> 01:09:10,952
It's gonna break my spirit.

1439
01:09:10,985 --> 01:09:12,920
As soon as they figure out
how to build that wall sideways

1440
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:14,555
and not just up,

1441
01:09:14,589 --> 01:09:16,858
no one is gonna be able
to get in or out.

1442
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:18,726
So if we want to leave,
we better make a run for it.

1443
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,395
No, Allan. You can't go.
Having a Barbie
in the Real World

1444
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,196
is what caused all these
problems in the first place.

1445
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:25,298
Not one person would care
if Allan was in the Real World.

1446
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:28,836
In fact, it's happened before.
All of *NSYNC, Allan.

1447
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,738
Yes, even him, so come on!

1448
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:31,773
Hey, you there.

1449
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,374
What do we do?

1450
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:35,342
Just get in the car
and keep it singing.

1451
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:36,476
-Hey, man.
-What?

1452
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:38,211
Be ready for anything.

1453
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:39,446
Who are you?

1454
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,649
I'm Allan. I'm, uh,
I'm Ken's buddy.

1455
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:43,350
Yeah, all of his clothes
fit me.

1456
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,522
Get in the car!

1457
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:52,660
You want a piece?

1458
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:53,895
Wait, you don't have
a driver's license.

1459
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:54,962
This car doesn't have
an engine.

1460
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:55,863
Fine.

1461
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:01,636
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1462
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:04,271
We have to go back.
Barbie Land needs saving.

1463
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:05,773
Barbie needs saving.

1464
01:10:05,807 --> 01:10:07,642
What? You hate Barbie!

1465
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,644
But you don't. You've always
believed in what she could be.

1466
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:12,947
Yeah, well, I was wrong.
Barbie gave up. The Kens won.

1467
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,415
You have to try.

1468
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:16,951
Even if--
Even if you can't
make it perfect,

1469
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:19,419
-you can make it better.
-I can't make anything better.

1470
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:20,855
I'm the one
who ruined Barbie Land

1471
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,289
with my stupid drawings
in the first place.

1472
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:23,891
They're not stupid!
They're amazing!

1473
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:28,261
You like my drawings?

1474
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:31,498
They're weird
and dark and crazy.

1475
01:10:31,532 --> 01:10:33,433
Everything
you pretend not to be.

1476
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:38,773
I am, I am. I'm weird
and I'm dark and I'm crazy.

1477
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:43,778
Easy. Easy.

1478
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:48,616
Okay. You want some more Allan?

1479
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:52,285
We have to get out of here
right now.

1480
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,822
Shut up, Allan!
We're going back.

1481
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:56,657
Let's go get my doll.

1482
01:11:00,528 --> 01:11:02,630
I'll never get out of here.

1483
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:03,998
Where do
we find Barbie?

1484
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:05,332
There's only
one place she'd be.

1485
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:08,770
You're a writer.

1486
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,671
This is your Nobel Prize.

1487
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:11,906
-Remember winning it?
-Huh.

1488
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,541
It's useless
trying to deprogram her.

1489
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:15,076
I already did
everything I could.

1490
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:18,079
Oh, my God.
I don't even know
how I got here.

1491
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:19,747
I don't deserve this.

1492
01:11:19,781 --> 01:11:22,517
Um, I'd like to thank Ken.

1493
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,385
Thank you, Ken.

1494
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:27,354
I love you, Ken.

1495
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:28,823
The fork in my soup is this,
Barb.

1496
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:31,793
Why didn't the brainwashing
work on you?

1497
01:11:31,826 --> 01:11:34,896
My exposure
to the Real World must
have made me immune.

1498
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:37,698
Either you're brainwashed,
or you're weird and ugly.

1499
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:38,900
There is no in between.

1500
01:11:38,933 --> 01:11:40,367
Sing it, sister.

1501
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,903
Well, get ready, kids.

1502
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:43,771
Because in 48 hours,
Barbie Land becomes Ken Land.

1503
01:11:43,805 --> 01:11:45,372
Come on, gang.

1504
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:46,641
We'll find Barbie
at the top of these stairs.

1505
01:11:46,674 --> 01:11:48,441
The Kens. They've found us.

1506
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:53,648
- Ken!
- No! Get back.

1507
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:54,816
Ken. Oh. Oh!

1508
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:00,087
- Hello?
- Hmm?

1509
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:02,389
- Humans. We're fine.
- Ah.

1510
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,457
- And Allan.
- Hmm.

1511
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:07,094
Come into my Weirdhouse.
Hi! I'm Weird Barbie.

1512
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:08,896
I'm in the splits,
I have a funky haircut,

1513
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,363
and I smell like basement.

1514
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,867
Oh, my God.
I had a Weird Barbie.

1515
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,003
-Yeah, you did.
-You make them weird
by playing too hard.

1516
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,805
That's cool.

1517
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,740
That's Sugar Daddy Ken.
And Earring Magic Ken.

1518
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,374
Mattel discontinued them.

1519
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:22,577
-Sugar Daddy?
-No, no, no.

1520
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,845
I'm not a sugar daddy.

1521
01:12:23,878 --> 01:12:26,479
This is Sugar,
and I'm her daddy.

1522
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:28,783
And I have an earring.
A magic earring.

1523
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,651
These were actual Kens.

1524
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:33,120
More
discontinued Barbies.

1525
01:12:33,154 --> 01:12:35,756
Growing Up Skipper? May I?

1526
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,924
- Okay.
- Watch this.

1527
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:40,728
-Her boobs grow.
-Why would they do that?

1528
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:42,697
And Barbie Video Girl.

1529
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,833
I have a TV in my back.
You know whose dream that is?

1530
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:48,102
Nobody. Nobody's dream.

1531
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,037
And that's Barbie Barbie,
of course.

1532
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,405
She's not dead. She's just
having an existential crisis.

1533
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:53,841
Okay, come on.

1534
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:56,376
Hey.

1535
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:58,079
What's wrong?

1536
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:05,920
I'm not
pretty anymore.

1537
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:09,523
What? You're so pretty.

1538
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:13,060
I'm not
Stereotypical Barbie pretty.

1539
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:14,762
<i>Note to the filmmakers.</i>

1540
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:15,963
<i>Margot Robbie is</i>
<i>the wrong person to cast</i>

1541
01:13:15,997 --> 01:13:17,064
<i>if you want to make this point.</i>

1542
01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:19,567
But you're beautiful.

1543
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,135
It's not just that. I'm not...

1544
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:24,805
smart enough to be interesting.

1545
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:27,008
You're so smart.

1546
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,043
- I can't do brain surgery,
I've never flown a plane.

1547
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:31,879
I'm not the president.

1548
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:35,683
No one on the Supreme Court
is me.

1549
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:42,455
I'm not good enough
for anything.

1550
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,866
It is literally impossible
to be a woman.

1551
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:57,104
You are so beautiful
and so smart,

1552
01:13:57,138 --> 01:14:00,741
and it kills me that you don't
think you're good enough.

1553
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:05,913
Like we have to always
be extraordinary.

1554
01:14:05,947 --> 01:14:09,951
But somehow,
we're always doing it wrong.

1555
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:14,689
You have to be thin
but not too thin,

1556
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:16,857
and you can never say
you want to be thin.

1557
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,993
You have to say
you want to be healthy,

1558
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:22,697
but also you have to be thin.

1559
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,599
You have to have money,
but you can't ask for money

1560
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,134
because that's crass.

1561
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,739
You have to be a boss
but you can't be mean.

1562
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:34,575
You have to lead,
but you can't squash
other people's ideas.

1563
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:36,077
You're supposed to love
being a mother,

1564
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,279
but don't talk about your kids
all the damn time.

1565
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:40,047
You have to be
a career woman

1566
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:43,517
but also always
be looking out
for other people.

1567
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:46,654
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane,

1568
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,623
but if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining.

1569
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:52,093
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

1570
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,594
that you tempt them too much

1571
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,129
or that you threaten
other women

1572
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,897
because you're supposed to be
a part of the sisterhood

1573
01:14:56,931 --> 01:14:58,699
but always stand out.

1574
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:01,235
And always be grateful.

1575
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,137
But never forget
that the system is rigged,

1576
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,772
so find a way
to acknowledge that

1577
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:06,841
but also always be grateful.

1578
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:08,843
You have to never get old,

1579
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,779
never be rude,
never show off,

1580
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:14,015
never be selfish,
never fall down,

1581
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:16,017
never fail, never show fear,

1582
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,918
never get out of line.

1583
01:15:17,952 --> 01:15:20,621
It's too hard,
it's too contradictory,

1584
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:23,657
and nobody gives you a medal
or says thank you.

1585
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,092
And it turns out, in fact,

1586
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:26,293
that not only
are you doing everything wrong

1587
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,896
but also
everything is your fault.

1588
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:37,638
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

1589
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:41,575
and every single other woman

1590
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:45,913
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us.

1591
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:51,152
And if all of that

1592
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:54,955
is also true for a doll

1593
01:15:56,223 --> 01:16:00,227
just representing a woman...

1594
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:05,332
then I don't even know.

1595
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:12,606
Wait.

1596
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:16,143
I did write a book.

1597
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:18,245
It's like I've been in a dream,

1598
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,282
where I was somehow
really invested

1599
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:24,118
in the Zack Snyder cut
of <i>Justice League.</i>

1600
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:28,923
But what you said
broke me out of it.

1601
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:30,791
Really?

1602
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:31,926
Yeah.

1603
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,894
You're back. She's back.

1604
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,163
By giving voice
to the cognitive
dissonance required

1605
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:37,865
to be a woman
under the patriarchy,

1606
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,967
-you robbed it of its power.
-Yes.

1607
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:42,970
Wow, I just said all of that.

1608
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:45,639
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

1609
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:48,909
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

1610
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:50,978
We have to stop the Kens.

1611
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:53,247
And you need to say
all of those things
to the other Barbies.

1612
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,748
-That's the key.
-Got it.

1613
01:16:54,782 --> 01:16:56,016
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

1614
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,685
away from their Kens?

1615
01:16:57,718 --> 01:16:59,120
We have experience
with a world like this one.

1616
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,721
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

1617
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:02,756
What do you think?

1618
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:07,128
- Wow.
- Thanks.
I built it.

1619
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:08,362
Okay, here's the deal.

1620
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:10,064
It's not just about
how they see us,

1621
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:11,866
it's about
how they see themselves.

1622
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,835
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

1623
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:17,805
First we have to get
the Barbies
away from their Kens.

1624
01:17:17,838 --> 01:17:21,041
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

1625
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:22,309
-That should be you.
-Cool.

1626
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:31,919
<i>Distract them</i>
<i>by appearing</i>
<i>helpless and confused.</i>

1627
01:17:31,952 --> 01:17:34,188
<i>Kens cannot resist</i>
<i>a damsel in distress.</i>

1628
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:36,790
<i>You have</i>
<i>to make them believe</i>
<i>that you're complacent.</i>

1629
01:17:36,824 --> 01:17:38,726
<i>That they have the power.</i>

1630
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:41,195
<i>And when their guard is down,</i>
<i>you take the power back.</i>

1631
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:46,267
The influence that Porsche 356

1632
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,402
has had on the motoring world
as a whole,

1633
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:49,803
it can't be overstated.

1634
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:52,039
Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

1635
01:17:52,072 --> 01:17:54,308
I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

1636
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,210
Honey, you can only use
the Select tool

1637
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,811
if the layer is highlighted.

1638
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:58,879
Let me show you.

1639
01:17:58,913 --> 01:18:00,281
My tiny head is just swimming

1640
01:18:00,314 --> 01:18:02,249
with technical jargon
like color bands...

1641
01:18:02,283 --> 01:18:05,085
-Oh! Hi.
-...and magnetic lassos
and bit maps.

1642
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:07,254
Do you think that you and your
strong arms can explain...

1643
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,323
- Oh! What's happening?
- Allan, go around!

1644
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:10,291
Ahh!

1645
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:13,127
-Oh, but what about Ken?
-No, no, no!

1646
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,930
- No, but I love him!
- Come on, Allan!

1647
01:18:15,963 --> 01:18:18,332
Hey!
What's gonna happen to Ken?

1648
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:19,867
Just listen.

1649
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,202
You have to be their mommies

1650
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:22,903
but not remind them
of their mommy.

1651
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:25,039
Any power you have
must be masked under a giggle.

1652
01:18:27,808 --> 01:18:28,809
What happened?

1653
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,277
One minute I was president,

1654
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:33,147
and the next I was cutting
a Ken steak for him.

1655
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,216
Welcome back, Madam President.

1656
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:38,786
Then we'll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies
to our cause.

1657
01:18:38,819 --> 01:18:40,988
<i>They can be</i>
<i>the new decoys.</i>

1658
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:42,957
<i>You can tell him</i>
<i>that you've never seen</i>
The Godfather.

1659
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,492
<i>And that you'd love them</i>
<i>to explain it to you.</i>

1660
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:48,229
Ooh, are you guys
watching <i>The Godfather?</i>

1661
01:18:48,262 --> 01:18:49,463
<i>The Godfather.</i>

1662
01:18:49,496 --> 01:18:51,165
I've never seen it.

1663
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,000
Oh, my God.
You've never seen
<i>The Godfather?</i>

1664
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,202
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

1665
01:18:55,236 --> 01:18:56,870
and a triumph for Robert Evans

1666
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,372
and the architecture
of the '70s studio system.

1667
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,840
Can you
start the movie over

1668
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:01,242
and just talk
through the whole thing?

1669
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,143
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

1670
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,845
without damaging their egos.

1671
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,247
Because if you say yes to them,
you're a tramp,

1672
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,215
but if you say no to them,
you're a prude.

1673
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,352
I don't wanna touch a foot.

1674
01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:12,786
No, you don't.

1675
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:15,055
Another one,
be confused about money.

1676
01:19:15,089 --> 01:19:17,491
I just have all my money
in a savings account.

1677
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:19,193
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

1678
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:20,427
corporate bonds, CDs.

1679
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:22,263
No one has CDs anymore.

1680
01:19:22,296 --> 01:19:25,065
Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute
when you're confused.

1681
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:26,900
But no, not music.

1682
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:29,303
CD stands for
Certificate of Deposit.

1683
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:31,939
Stephen Malkmus
really harnessed
the acerbic talk-singing

1684
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:33,474
of Lou Reed
with post-punk influences

1685
01:19:33,508 --> 01:19:35,476
such as Wire and The Fall.

1686
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,411
What am I wearing?
I would never choose this.

1687
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:40,014
Because you're a physicist.
Do you want some pants?

1688
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:41,081
Yeah.

1689
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,351
Welcome back, Barbie.

1690
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:47,354
Gee, I am so awkward
and don't feel pretty at all,

1691
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:49,290
and will anyone ever like me?

1692
01:19:49,323 --> 01:19:51,258
<i>Or distract them</i>
<i>with the old standby.</i>

1693
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,427
<i>Wearing glasses so they can</i>
<i>discover that you're pretty.</i>

1694
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,296
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

1695
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:03,404
There. Now we can see
your beautiful face.

1696
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:05,573
And then there's pretending
to be terrible

1697
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:07,174
at every sport ever.

1698
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:09,209
Here, let me show you.

1699
01:20:09,243 --> 01:20:11,045
Here, let me show you.

1700
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:13,280
-Here, let me show you.
-Here, let me show you.

1701
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:15,517
Here, let us show you.

1702
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:17,951
We'll do this
until every single Barbie

1703
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:20,555
is deprogrammed and ready
to take back Barbie Land.

1704
01:20:20,588 --> 01:20:21,623
-Yes!
-Yes!

1705
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:23,057
Yeah!

1706
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:31,932
Hey! Tomorrow the Kens vote
to change the Constitution,

1707
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:33,334
so we have to get there first.

1708
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:34,968
The final stage of our plan,

1709
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:37,237
to turn the Kens
against each other.

1710
01:20:37,271 --> 01:20:39,507
Now that they think
they have power over you,

1711
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,909
you make them question whether
they have enough power

1712
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:43,310
over each other.

1713
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:45,547
What if this doesn't work?

1714
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,947
What if he doesn't...

1715
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,983
like me anymore?

1716
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:54,221
-He likes you.
-He was really upset.

1717
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,291
Because he likes you.

1718
01:20:57,324 --> 01:20:59,059
And because he knows deep down

1719
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:01,195
that you don't like him
the same way.

1720
01:21:01,228 --> 01:21:02,996
It still doesn't mean
I want to hurt him.

1721
01:21:04,331 --> 01:21:06,200
He took your house.

1722
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:07,502
He brainwashed your friends.

1723
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:09,470
He wants to control
the government.

1724
01:21:09,504 --> 01:21:11,004
True.

1725
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:13,207
- Girl.
- Yeah.

1726
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,042
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1727
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:17,378
It's like I'm a woman already.

1728
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:19,046
Welcome.

1729
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:20,481
Is this what it's like?

1730
01:21:20,515 --> 01:21:22,449
It's time.

1731
01:21:22,483 --> 01:21:23,651
I'm ready.

1732
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:25,886
Thank you.

1733
01:21:26,554 --> 01:21:27,488
Here I go.

1734
01:21:34,328 --> 01:21:36,497
Hi.

1735
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:41,603
Ahh!

1736
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:48,108
Oh, hey.
You've caught me reading.

1737
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:50,144
Oh.

1738
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,478
-I've been thinking.
-Mm-hmm.

1739
01:21:51,513 --> 01:21:53,480
- Ken Land.
- Kendom.

1740
01:21:53,515 --> 01:21:55,115
-Kendom.
-Kendom Land.

1741
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,450
-Land of the--
-Land of the free and the men.

1742
01:21:56,483 --> 01:21:58,218
Right. Well, this place is...

1743
01:21:58,252 --> 01:21:59,521
Kendom Land.

1744
01:21:59,554 --> 01:22:01,121
...really great.

1745
01:22:01,155 --> 01:22:03,490
And the Kens really
are just better at ruling

1746
01:22:03,525 --> 01:22:05,459
than the Barbies ever were.

1747
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:08,095
Well, we just took
patriarchy and you know,
made a patriarchy.

1748
01:22:08,128 --> 01:22:10,297
-Yeah, well, I was thinking...
-Yes?

1749
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:14,201
I'm ready to be
your long-term-distance

1750
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:16,303
low-commitment
casual girlfriend,

1751
01:22:16,336 --> 01:22:17,672
if you'll still have me.

1752
01:22:19,574 --> 01:22:21,041
Would you just hold on
for one second?

1753
01:22:21,074 --> 01:22:22,109
Oh, okay.

1754
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:28,550
Sublime!

1755
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:34,589
I don't know. I'm gonna
have to think about that.

1756
01:22:34,622 --> 01:22:35,489
Oh.

1757
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:38,225
Please?

1758
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:42,496
Okay.

1759
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,465
Come on in.
I'll play the guitar at you.

Sorry. One sec.

1788
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,580
That's a beautiful song
that you're playing.

1789
01:24:38,613 --> 01:24:40,180
Did you write it?

1790
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,149
Yes. You want to sit here

while I stare uncomfortably
into your eyes

Does the title of
long-term-distance casual

1806
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:16,684
low-commitment girlfriend
mean nothing?

1807
01:25:16,718 --> 01:25:18,151
What do we do?

1808
01:25:18,185 --> 01:25:20,622
We beach every individual
one of them off.

1809
01:25:20,655 --> 01:25:21,556
No.

1810
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,158
We go to war.

1811
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:26,861
-Against the Barbies?
-No, against the Kens.

1812
01:25:26,894 --> 01:25:28,428
-But we are the Kens.
-The other Kens.

1813
01:25:28,462 --> 01:25:29,797
We should probably
call them something else

1814
01:25:29,831 --> 01:25:31,298
so it doesn't get confusing.

1815
01:25:31,331 --> 01:25:32,533
No, because we'll know
what we mean.

1816
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:33,801
But when we're
on the battlefield

1817
01:25:33,835 --> 01:25:35,603
and you say
"Ken at four o'clock,"

1818
01:25:35,637 --> 01:25:36,938
how will I know if you mean
us Kens or the other Kens?

1819
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:38,706
Because, my dudes,
we attack at ten o'clock

1820
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,942
and take advantage
of the morning waves.

1821
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:43,611
But not so early 'cause we're
gonna want to sleep in.

1822
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:45,178
Right.

1823
01:25:45,212 --> 01:25:46,413
But what will we fight with?
We have no guns.

1824
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:48,583
Tennis rackets and volleyballs.

1825
01:25:48,616 --> 01:25:50,250
And slap fights.

1826
01:25:50,283 --> 01:25:51,318
And beach offs.

1827
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:53,253

-Huh? Yeah?

1890
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,761
Weren't we supposed
to vote today?

1891
01:31:00,795 --> 01:31:02,863
-What?
-To change the Constitution.

1892
01:31:02,897 --> 01:31:05,633
-Oh, it was today, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

1893
01:31:10,604 --> 01:31:12,640
Okay, ladies, let's do this.

1894
01:31:12,673 --> 01:31:16,210
All those in favor of letting
Barbie Land be Barbie Land,

1895
01:31:16,243 --> 01:31:17,878
say "Aye."

1896
01:31:17,912 --> 01:31:19,113
Aye!

1897
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,029
I'm so happy.

1898
01:31:35,062 --> 01:31:38,165
Go, Barbie!
Go, Barbie!
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1899
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:42,003
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1900
01:31:53,714 --> 01:31:55,282
Is it just my imagination,

1901
01:31:55,316 --> 01:32:00,321
or did these Mojo Dojo
Casa Houses just get dreamier?

1902
01:32:00,354 --> 01:32:03,024
That's because they're
Dreamhouses, mother....

1903
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:04,692
That's right.

1904
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:06,694
We've reinstated
the Barbie Land Constitution

1905
01:32:06,727 --> 01:32:08,229
to what it should be.

1906
01:32:08,262 --> 01:32:11,065
And restored all the Barbies'
brains and autonomy.

1907
01:32:11,098 --> 01:32:12,033
Yes!

1908
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:17,605
And we seriously disinfected
those houses.

1909
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:18,639
What do we do?

1910
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,776
Kens!

1911
01:32:23,811 --> 01:32:25,913
-Who are we attacking, sir?
-No...

1912
01:32:28,082 --> 01:32:29,116
No...

1913
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:34,588
Don't look at me!

1914
01:32:35,356 --> 01:32:37,191
Is he crying?

1915
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:38,959
Just give us a minute.

1916
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:45,900
Ken.

1917
01:32:48,335 --> 01:32:49,737
Are you okay?

1918
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,272
Yeah. Totally.

1919
01:32:51,305 --> 01:32:53,107
It's okay
if you're crying.

1920
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,643
You know, I cried too.
It's actually kind of amazing.

1921
01:32:55,676 --> 01:32:58,045
I'm a liberated man.
I know crying is not weak.

1922
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:00,181
Okay.

1923
01:33:01,715 --> 01:33:02,750
You wanna sit up for a minute?

1924
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:10,157
This, uh...

1925
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:12,026
It was hard running stuff.

1926
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,096
I didn't love it.

1927
01:33:15,930 --> 01:33:17,264
I get it.

1928
01:33:21,902 --> 01:33:23,904
And those mini-fridges
are so small.

1929
01:33:23,938 --> 01:33:25,873
- Mm-hmm.
 -You could only fit a six pack in them.

1930
01:33:25,906 --> 01:33:29,176
And the freezers
are basically useless.

1931
01:33:31,045 --> 01:33:32,780
To be honest, when I found out

1932
01:33:32,813 --> 01:33:34,248
that patriarchy wasn't
about horses,

1933
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:35,916
I lost interest anyway.

1934
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:38,319
That's okay.

1935
01:33:43,457 --> 01:33:46,193
I always thought this
would be our house.

1936
01:33:49,063 --> 01:33:50,197
Oh.

1937
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:56,737
Ken.

1938
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:59,273
-I think I owe you an apology.
-Huh?

1939
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:01,275
I'm really sorry
I took you for granted.

1940
01:34:01,308 --> 01:34:03,811
Oh.

1941
01:34:03,844 --> 01:34:06,147
Not every night
had to be girls' night.

1942
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:11,752
Thank you
for saying that.

1943
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:14,054
Thank you.

1944
01:34:16,023 --> 01:34:19,460
Oh. I didn't mean
to suggest, uh...

1945
01:34:19,493 --> 01:34:22,062
I just don't know who I am
without you.

1946
01:34:23,397 --> 01:34:25,032
You're Ken.

1947
01:34:26,033 --> 01:34:29,103
But it's "Barbie and Ken."

1948
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:33,307
There is no just "Ken."

1949
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:36,343
That's why I was created.

1950
01:34:36,377 --> 01:34:38,045
I only exist

1951
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,849
within the warmth of your gaze.

1952
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,386
Without it,

1953
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:49,223
I'm just another blond guy
who can't do flips.

1954
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:03,737
Maybe it's time
to discover who Ken is.

1955
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:06,073
- Okay. I think I get it now.
- Okay.

1956
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:09,476
No, no, no!
This isn't the answer.

1957
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:13,314
I feel so stupid.

1958
01:35:13,347 --> 01:35:14,882
- No.
- No.

1959
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:17,251
- I look so stupid.
- Yeah.

1960
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:19,820
I look so stupid!

1961
01:35:19,853 --> 01:35:23,090
- No!
- So cool. You look so cool.

1962
01:35:23,123 --> 01:35:25,492
Okay. Ken,
you have to figure out

1963
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:27,328
who you are without me.

1964
01:35:28,195 --> 01:35:30,097
Why?

1965
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:31,966
You're not your girlfriend.

1966
01:35:31,999 --> 01:35:34,868
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

1967
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:36,837
- Beach?
- Nope.

1968
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,872
You're not even beach.

1969
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:42,977
Maybe all the things
that you thought made you you

1970
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:46,981
aren't... really you.

1971
01:35:51,819 --> 01:35:54,154
Maybe it's Barbie and...

1972
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:57,891
it's Ken.

1973
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:04,198
Ken is...

1974
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:06,934
me?

1975
01:36:06,967 --> 01:36:08,135
Yes.

1976
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:10,971
Ken is me!

1977
01:36:12,206 --> 01:36:13,941
And I'm Barbie.

1978
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:17,911
Ken...

1979
01:36:19,514 --> 01:36:20,515
is me!

1980
01:36:20,548 --> 01:36:21,815
Ken is me!

1981
01:36:21,849 --> 01:36:23,183
-Ken is me!
-Ken is me!

1982
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:25,520
I don't even care
about being Ken anymore.

1983
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:26,854
I just miss my friend Barbie!

1984
01:36:26,887 --> 01:36:28,422
-That's cool!
-Barbie!

1985
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:30,157
I'm right here.

1986
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:31,191
Ken!

1987
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:38,165
I want you to have it.

1988
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:40,301
Aw. That's nice.

1989
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:50,512
We were only fighting
because we didn't know
who we were.

1990
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:57,484
Ken is me!

1991
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,895
Ken is right.

1992
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:10,397
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

1993
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:12,299
-You know?
-That's my boss.

1994
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:14,536
It's... Oh.

1995
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:16,538
Midge, gosh.

1996
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:18,339
I thought we discontinued her.

1997
01:37:20,474 --> 01:37:23,143
Look,
do you know how many times

1998
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:26,480
I've wanted to stand up
in a board meeting
and just say,

1999
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:28,550
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

2000
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:30,284
-Really?
-Let's have a company retreat

2001
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:32,052
and just tickle each other.

2002
01:37:32,086 --> 01:37:34,188
- Someone get me.
Someone get me.

2003
01:37:35,657 --> 01:37:37,525
I love being tickled.

2004
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:40,595
No, no, no. Don't hug me.
Don't hug me.

2005
01:37:43,397 --> 01:37:45,432
But thanks to the Barbies,

2006
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:48,969
I, too, can now relieve
myself of this heavy
existential burden

2007
01:37:49,002 --> 01:37:53,006
while holding on to
the very real title of CEO.

2008
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,510
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

2009
01:37:55,543 --> 01:37:57,277
to exactly the way it was.

2010
01:37:57,311 --> 01:38:00,981
-Mister Mattel, I just--
-Please. Call me Mother.

2011
01:38:01,014 --> 01:38:02,349
No, thank you.

2012
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:04,151
I don't think
that things should go back

2013
01:38:04,184 --> 01:38:05,653
to the way that they were.

2014
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:09,256
No Barbie or Ken should be
living in the shadows.

2015
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:10,592
Or Allan.

2016
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:12,960
-Hey.
-Me?

2017
01:38:12,993 --> 01:38:14,662
-Yeah.
-Oh. Hello.

2018
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:16,096
I just want to say,

2019
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,398
I'm sorry
we called you Weird Barbie

2020
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:19,066
behind your back
and also to your face.

2021
01:38:19,099 --> 01:38:21,335
That's okay. I'm owning it.

2022
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,237
Would you like a job
in my cabinet?

2023
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:25,339
May I please have sanitation?

2024
01:38:26,407 --> 01:38:28,008
It's yours.

2025
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,577
- Yeah, thank you.
- All right.

2026
01:38:29,611 --> 01:38:31,311
-Madam President.
-Oh.

2027
01:38:31,345 --> 01:38:34,281
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

2028
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:38,385
Oh, I can't do that.
But maybe a lower circuit
court judgeship.

2029
01:38:38,419 --> 01:38:40,354
We accept.
As long as we can wear robes.

2030
01:38:40,387 --> 01:38:42,590
<i>Well, the Kens</i>
<i>have to start somewhere.</i>

2031
01:38:42,624 --> 01:38:44,559
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>the Kens will have</i>

2032
01:38:44,592 --> 01:38:47,060
<i>as much power and influence</i>
<i>in Barbie Land</i>

2033
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:49,997
<i>as women have</i>
<i>in the Real World.</i>

2034
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:51,165
No, I don't want to.

2035
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:52,466
-Just go!
-I can't.

2036
01:38:52,499 --> 01:38:55,469
-Grow up and go.
-I have an idea.

2037
01:38:55,503 --> 01:38:57,271
Tell me your secret dream,
child.

2038
01:38:57,304 --> 01:39:00,608
Okay,
what about Ordinary Barbie?

2039
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:03,645
She's not extraordinary.
She's not president
of anything,

2040
01:39:03,678 --> 01:39:05,045
or maybe she is.

2041
01:39:05,078 --> 01:39:07,014
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

2042
01:39:07,047 --> 01:39:10,317
Because it's okay
to just want to be a mom,

2043
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:12,620
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

2044
01:39:12,654 --> 01:39:14,421
Or not a mom
who's also not president.

2045
01:39:14,455 --> 01:39:16,558
She just has a flattering top,

2046
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,091
and she wants
to get through the day

2047
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,662
feeling kinda good
about herself.

2048
01:39:23,063 --> 01:39:25,299
That's a terrible idea.

2049
01:39:25,332 --> 01:39:26,701
Yeah,
that's going to make money.

2050
01:39:26,734 --> 01:39:30,437
Oh. Ordinary Barbie.
I love it. Fantastic.

2051
01:39:30,471 --> 01:39:31,606
Okay, great.

2052
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:33,207
-Great.
-Cool.

2053
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,441
-Yes.
-We good?

2054
01:39:34,475 --> 01:39:35,643
I think we're good, right?

2055
01:39:35,677 --> 01:39:37,579
All right, let's begin the work

2056
01:39:37,612 --> 01:39:40,447
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

2057
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:42,483
Hey, what about Barbie?

2058
01:39:42,517 --> 01:39:43,718
What do you mean?

2059
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:45,319
Yeah,
what about Barbie?

2060
01:39:45,352 --> 01:39:49,423
What's her ending?
What does she get?

2061
01:39:49,456 --> 01:39:52,259
Well, that's easy.
She's in love with Ken.

2062
01:39:52,292 --> 01:39:54,729
- Aw.
- That is not her ending.

2063
01:39:57,064 --> 01:39:59,099
- I'm not in love with Ken.
- Oh.

2064
01:39:59,132 --> 01:40:00,167
What do you want?

2065
01:40:02,169 --> 01:40:03,538
I don't know. I'm...

2066
01:40:05,673 --> 01:40:08,442
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore.

2067
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:15,215
I don't think I have an ending.

2068
01:40:15,249 --> 01:40:17,284
That was
always the point.

2069
01:40:17,317 --> 01:40:20,487
I created you
so you wouldn't have an ending.

2070
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:23,323
It's you.

2071
01:40:25,693 --> 01:40:27,529
You're Ruth from Mattel.

2072
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:30,330
Baby, I am Mattel.

2073
01:40:30,364 --> 01:40:33,300
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie.

2074
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:34,569
So, you're...

2075
01:40:34,602 --> 01:40:37,639
Ruth Handler.
Inventor of Barbie.

2076
01:40:37,672 --> 01:40:38,806
What?

2077
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,374
That's so cool.

2078
01:40:40,407 --> 01:40:42,577
Her ghost keeps an office
on the 17th floor.

2079
01:40:42,610 --> 01:40:43,578
- What?
- What?

2080
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,379
You guys,

2081
01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:48,282
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

2082
01:40:48,315 --> 01:40:50,450
I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

2083
01:40:50,484 --> 01:40:52,152
with a double mastectomy...

2084
01:40:52,185 --> 01:40:54,321
...and tax evasion issues.

2085
01:40:54,354 --> 01:40:56,791
Nobody looks like Barbie,

2086
01:40:56,824 --> 01:41:00,360
except, of course, Barbie.
Take a bow, honey.

2087
01:41:02,429 --> 01:41:05,198
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore.

2088
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:11,138
Come, walk with me.

2089
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,292
Thank you.

2090
01:41:34,294 --> 01:41:35,462
Thank you, Barbie.

2091
01:41:37,565 --> 01:41:38,465
Thank you.

2092
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:50,477
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

2093
01:41:50,511 --> 01:41:53,180
I've always been
Stereotypical Barbie,

2094
01:41:53,213 --> 01:41:56,517
and I don't think I'm really
good at anything else.

2095
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:58,720
You saved Barbie Land
from patriarchy.

2096
01:41:58,753 --> 01:42:01,522
That was very much
a group effort.

2097
01:42:01,556 --> 01:42:04,491
And you helped that mother
and daughter connect.

2098
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:06,159
They really helped each other.

2099
01:42:07,528 --> 01:42:09,864
Maybe
you're Self-Effacing Barbie?

2100
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:13,668
Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore.

2101
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:26,781
You understand that humans
only have one ending.

2102
01:42:26,814 --> 01:42:31,218
Ideas live forever,
humans not so much.

2103
01:42:31,251 --> 01:42:32,587
You know that, right?

2104
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,187
I do.

2105
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:36,724
Being a human
can be pretty uncomfortable.

2106
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:39,694
I know.

2107
01:42:39,727 --> 01:42:43,798
Humans make things up
like patriarchy and Barbie

2108
01:42:43,831 --> 01:42:46,601
just to deal
with how uncomfortable it is.

2109
01:42:47,467 --> 01:42:49,269
I understand that.

2110
01:42:49,302 --> 01:42:50,605
And then you die.

2111
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:53,675
Yeah.

2112
01:42:55,743 --> 01:42:56,778
Yeah.

2113
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:07,689
I want to be
a part of the people

2114
01:43:07,722 --> 01:43:09,524
that make meaning.

2115
01:43:10,958 --> 01:43:12,894
Not the thing that's made.

2116
01:43:15,596 --> 01:43:18,533
I want to do the imagining.
I don't wanna be the idea.

2117
01:43:18,566 --> 01:43:20,702
Does that make sense?

2118
01:43:20,735 --> 01:43:22,904
I always knew that Barbie
would surprise me,

2119
01:43:22,937 --> 01:43:25,940
but I never expected this.

2120
01:43:25,973 --> 01:43:30,511
Do you give me permission
to become human?

2121
01:43:30,545 --> 01:43:32,580
You don't need my permission.

2122
01:43:32,613 --> 01:43:36,383
But you're the creator.
You... Don't you control me?

2123
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:37,852
I can't control you

2124
01:43:37,885 --> 01:43:41,354
any more than I can control
my own daughter.

2125
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:43,725
I named you after her,
Barbara.

2126
01:43:43,758 --> 01:43:47,662
And I always hoped for you
like I hoped for her.

2127
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,565
We mothers stand still

2128
01:43:50,598 --> 01:43:54,569
so our daughters can look back
to see how far they've come.

2129
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:03,310
So, being human's not
something I need to...

2130
01:44:03,343 --> 01:44:07,447
ask for or even want?
I can just...

2131
01:44:09,382 --> 01:44:11,619
It's something
that I just discover I am?

2132
01:44:13,721 --> 01:44:16,389
I can't in good conscience
let you take this leap

2133
01:44:16,423 --> 01:44:18,458
without you knowing
what it means.

2134
01:44:22,362 --> 01:44:23,564
Take my hands.

2135
01:44:30,538 --> 01:44:31,939
Now close your eyes.

2136
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:43,918

<i>of Barbie Land</i>

2153

2154
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:25,987
Okay. Thanks for the lift.

2155
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,788
You got this.

2156
01:46:27,822 --> 01:46:29,156

01:46:41,936 --> 01:46:44,639
Okay. Whew!
Let's do this.

<i>Si se puede.</i>

2164
01:46:45,806 --> 01:46:46,774
That's a political statement.

2165
01:46:46,807 --> 01:46:48,075
That's appropriation, Dad.

2166
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:50,044
Whoo-hoo!

2167
01:46:50,077 --> 01:46:51,444
