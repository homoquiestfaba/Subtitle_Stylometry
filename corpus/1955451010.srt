1
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,544
Uh...

2
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,414
Vinny went to the wrong hotel.

3
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,282
The wrong hotel?
Yeah.

4
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,419
Motherfucker, how many Caesar
palace they got in las Vegas?

5
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,622
- He'll be here. -We are
gonna start the weigh-in.

6
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,091
If pazienza is
not here by 7:00,

7
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,327
he will be disqualified.

8
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,330
Shit.

9
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,134
Ash.

10
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,204
Ash, answer the phone!

11
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,573
Hello?

12
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,408
<i>Tell vinny they're going ahead.</i>

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,310
They're going ahead.
Just hold them off.

14
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,646
- Tell them I'm coming.
- He's coming.

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,582
<i>Where's he at?</i> Where's he at?
He's on the fucking bicycle.

16
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,251
No, his weight.
What fuckin' weight's he at?

17
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,319
Where you at, vinny?
I'm comin'!

18
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,054
He's comin'.

19
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,492
139 pounds and three quarters.

20
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,694
Fuck.

21
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,596
Tell vinny that
Roger made weight.

22
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,299
- Where the fuck's your boy?
- What are you so worried about?

23
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,134
Where the hell you have to be?

24
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,970
Beating your pizza-faced,
liberace son back to Boston.

25
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:55,007
Hey! Hey! Hey!
We're from Providence!

26
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,342
He'll be here. He'll be here.
Calm down.

27
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,611
He'll be here. Don't you worry about it.
He's gonna be here.

28
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,213
He'll be here.
He's gonna be here.

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,650
He gonna make it?

30
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,388
Got a little surprise for you.

31
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,426
Get your motherfucking dick
out my face.

32
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,495
He can't take his eyes off me.

33
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,399
He still looks big.

34
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,468
This is gonna be close.

35
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,516
140 pounds even.

36
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,352
Yeah!

37
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,590
Yeah!

38
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,537
<i>Behind me the casino here
at Caesar's,</i>

39
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:34,706
<i>and, yes, the Eve
of the big fight.</i>

40
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,644
<i>Roger Mayweather
defending against vinny pazienza</i>

41
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:42,080
<i>for the wbc super lightweight
championship.</i>

42
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,217
Bottom line is that I'm willing to
die in that ring tomorrow night.

43
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,053
I don't think he's ready
to make that sacrifice.

44
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,222
Damn straight,
'cause there ain't no need to.

45
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,324
Boy thinking about dying
instead of boxing.

46
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,226
That should tell you all
you need to know.

47
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,464
Motherfucker,
tomorrow night you gone.

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,533
Yeah? I'm gonna rain on you
like a thunderstorm.

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,735
You scary.
Yeah.

50
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,338
Do me a favor. Tomorrow
you get yourself a tic tac.

51
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,101
If you're this close to me tomorrow,
I'm gonna knock you the fuck out.

52
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,751
You all right, champ?
Yeah, yeah. I'm feelin' good.

53
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,154
Yeah.

54
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,423
I know you are.

55
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,525
You need anything?
Nah, I'm good.

56
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,227
- What you doin'? You goin' to bed?
- Yeah. Big day tomorrow.

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,964
Hey, you should hit the hay too.

58
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,766
Yeah, definitely, pop.
Okay. Good night.

59
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,901
Good night.

60
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,578
Five the fever! Wally
cleaver loves the beaver!

61
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,586
Yeah.
All right. Hey, hey.

62
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,556
Blow on those.

63
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,058
Yeah!

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,728
Baby. You're up 100k,
all right?

65
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,563
Shouldn't you just
call it quits?

66
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,631
Yeah, yeah.
Just order another oj.

67
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,699
I'm not thirsty.

68
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,241
What are you doing here?
I'm splitting tens.

69
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:20,145
Don't you think you should be
getting some rest for tomorrow?

70
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,381
- It is tomorrow.
- Yeah, relax. Just go ahead.

71
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,451
All right. Yeah.

72
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,954
Okay. Yeah.

73
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,290
Mmm.

74
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,663
Too many. Too many! Yes!

75
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:39,998
Mmm!
Baby, come on!

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,435
Vinny! Vinny! God, vinny!
Yeah, baby.

77
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,605
Yeah. Yeah! Too many!

78
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,640
Oh.
He's an animal.

79
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,256
Who splits tens
on a $20,000 hand?

80
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,690
You shut up.

81
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,682
Come on, vinny! Come on!

82
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,222
Oh, solid right hand
inside by Mayweather.

83
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,558
Pazienza stopped in his tracks.

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,693
Got his attention
pretty good right there.

85
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,063
What are you doing?
Get in there!

86
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,101
Solid right hand
right on the eye.

87
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,304
That hurt him.
I question, though,

88
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,840
whether we'll ever see
pazienza in the ring again

89
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,441
after taking a beating
like this.

90
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,443
Knock him down!

91
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,078
Right back.

92
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,014
I'm telling you,
he's got a lot of heart.

93
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,852
- More action after the bell.

94
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,688
I can take that all day!
You got nothing! Come on!

95
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,922
Come on!

96
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,657
I got it, I got it.
I'm fine.

97
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,392
I got it, I got it.

98
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,562
I got this. I got it.

99
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,665
<i>Give us your score.</i>

100
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,803
<i>Okay, I've got it eight rounds to
three, 107-101, favor Roger Mayweather.</i>

101
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,873
<i>I think he's winning
the fight big...</i>

102
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,475
<i>Good right hand there.
Best right hand of the fight.</i>

103
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,944
<i>- Right on that eye.
- Why let it go any farther?</i>

104
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,448
<i>Well, because he's a fighter.</i>

105
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,318
<i>- He wants to finish the fight.
- That's true.</i>

106
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,188
- What's going on? -Nothing, ma.
He's still in his corner.

107
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,023
<i>I'm stopping that fight.</i>

108
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,359
<i>I'm not waiting for a doctor
to make the decision.</i>

109
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,694
You're not gonna win on points.

110
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,564
You gotta knock him out.
Vinny, you gotta knock him out.

111
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,233
Hey, champ, champ.
You all right?

112
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,535
Yeah. Yeah, fine, pop.

113
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,203
Okay. You got this.

114
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,639
You got this.
Now let's bury him!

115
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,874
Come on!

116
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,312
Two hands, vinny!

117
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,615
Oh! God...

118
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,452
His eye. Work that cut.

119
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,934
You've got ketosis.

120
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:07,272
- What does that mean?
- I'm just dehydrated, pop.

121
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,908
We're in the desert, vinny. I
see a lot of dehydration cases.

122
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,210
This isn't that.

123
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,547
Doc, I've been doing it this way forever.
This is how it goes for me.

124
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:18,049
Well, you can't keep doing
it like this. Yeah.

125
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,619
Thank you, doc.
Appreciate it.

126
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,128
No.
It's weird, ma.

127
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,998
It's not weird.
Don't put so much salt on it.

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not. I'm putting parsley. You would
if you didn't knock this thing over.

129
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,071
Stop crying about the
fucking elephant already.

130
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,673
There we go.
Honest.

131
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,342
I'm not crying.
Hey, you want to set the table, John?

132
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,744
All right. All right.
Go.

133
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,481
Hey, ma,
you watch the fight yet?

134
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,917
Oh, no. No, I can't
watch you get hurt.

135
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,986
Yeah, well, you know
i don't get hurt.

136
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,688
Where's the tape at?

137
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,590
It's in the vcr.
Okay.

138
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,361
Can you put that there? Will
you move this off the table?

139
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,230
I can't do two things
at once, can I?

140
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,069
<i>For the wbc
super lightweight title.</i>

141
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,608
<i>If will and want
to alone was all that mattered,</i>

142
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,645
<i>pazienza can beat this guy, but
will can only take you so far</i>

143
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,148
<i>unless you can bring
some skill along with it.</i>

144
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,618
<i>It's called an old-fashioned
"paint job" in Philadelphia.</i>

145
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,723
<i>And for about
the half-dozenth time</i>

146
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,491
<i>they scrimmage after the bell.</i>

147
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,394
<i>And Lou duva goes after
Roger Mayweather.</i>

148
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,297
<i>Now, that's one of the silliest
things he could ever have done.</i>

149
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,232
<i>Well,
then Mayweather punched him.</i>

150
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,901
<i>Lou!</i>

151
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,036
<i>You're talking about a guy
in his 60s.</i>

152
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,838
Vinny, shut it off.

153
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,641
We're eatin'.
Okay. Yeah, I'm comin'.

154
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,712
<i>That's not professional.</i>

155
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,182
<i>How'd it feel to take a shot
from a world champ?</i>

156
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,317
<i>He hits like a altar boy.</i>

157
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>What's the next move for vinny
after this fight?</i>

158
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,855
<i>I don't know
if there's gonna be a next.</i>

159
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,091
<i>Now's not the time
for an announcement,</i>

160
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,195
<i>but as far as I'm concerned, vinny
pazienza shouldn't fight no more.</i>

161
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,897
<i>Now boxing's been good to him,
and he's been good to boxing,</i>

162
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,365
<i>and that's where it should end.</i>

163
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,800
<i>Excuse me. I'm sorry.</i>

164
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,770
Come here, vinny.
I'm good.

165
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,505
Come here.
I'll have more.

166
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,273
Ridiculous.
I don't know what you expect.

167
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,755
- Be happy with what you got. -It's
gonna fall out of his head.

168
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,452
Pop, stay calm, all right?
I need to set up the next fight.

169
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,194
Vinny, Angelo. Come on in.

170
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,300
Angelo.

171
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,569
Uh, what a surprise.

172
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,704
- How you doin', vinny?
- They block the driveway?

173
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,774
We need to talk.

174
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,677
You should have called first. You know
I don't take meetings in the house.

175
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,346
Yeah, and you should have thought
before opening your fucking mouth

176
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,816
and telling the whole world
my son should retire.

177
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,350
All right, all right.

178
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,885
Come on now.
Lou, let's talk.

179
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,555
Come on.
Fine. Let's talk.

180
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,862
Vinny ain't done, Lou.

181
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,298
And even if you think he is,

182
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,267
you got no business
announcing it on hbo.

183
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,269
What the fuck.

184
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,805
Vinny'll decide when he's done.

185
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,941
I wish we'd spoken first,
but it's not a perfect world.

186
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,043
It's fine.
It's all right. Lou.

187
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,612
- I need another fight.

188
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,615
What's with the deep fuckin' breath? You
owe him another fight in his contract.

189
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,217
Pop.

190
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,185
Lookit, vinny.

191
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,020
All I'm saying is that I think

192
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,957
maybe you oughta start thinking
about more important things.

193
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,860
Your sister's getting married. You should
consider doing the same. Start a family.

194
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,462
What the fuck does that
have to do with him fighting?

195
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,165
- Pop, please. -Even when you
win, we go to the hospital.

196
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,601
Who's we?
I ain't ever seen you there.

197
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,006
Huh? Lou.

198
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,108
For fuck's sake, say something.

199
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,714
You got heart, kid, but you
wear it on your fuckin' chin.

200
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,016
I seriously think you oughta
consider hanging it up.

201
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,186
I'm not done yet.
All right? I got more in me.

202
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,622
That's not the problem.
You always got more.

203
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,460
I'm beggin' you here, Lou.
Give me another shot.

204
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,964
Just one more.

205
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,387
Fuck.

206
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,937
Rough night?

207
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,305
No, great night.

208
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,541
Rough morning.

209
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,711
You're early.

210
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,146
You're drunk.

211
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,949
No, I'm hung over.
There's a huge difference.

212
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,050
Oh.

213
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, you smell like liquor.

214
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,055
And you smell like Rhode Island.

215
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,993
What, you never had
a big night before?

216
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,661
Nah, I don't drink.

217
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,098
Yeah? Good for you.

218
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,133
Now, if we're done
with the fucking introductions,

219
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,668
I can't see shit out here.

220
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,247
This is where
you trained Tyson, huh?

221
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,584
Yeah.
That is crazy.

222
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,692
This your family?

223
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,894
Yeah.

224
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,930
You guys go to Disneyland?

225
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,434
World. In Orlando.

226
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,238
Oh, no. Not yet.

227
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,909
So, uh, why did Tyson fire you?

228
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,445
- What?
- Was it that dui thing?

229
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,981
What are you, a newspaperman?

230
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,151
Nah, I'm just asking.

231
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,487
Do you not want to be here?

232
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,289
Yeah, I'm standing here,
aren't I?

233
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,759
All right, listen.

234
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,494
Let's get real, vinny.

235
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,496
Yeah.

236
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,168
You lost three in a row,
last one a title fight.

237
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,770
You got nothing lined up
'cause you're not a draw.

238
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,774
Your own manager, on fuckin'
hbo, said you should hang it up.

239
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,844
Only reason you're standing
in my gym

240
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,480
is because Lou sent you here...

241
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,150
To put us both out to pasture.

242
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,690
So you want to get this over
with, let's get it over with.

243
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,630
You throw a hook, then go boom!

244
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,332
Move 9 to 5 and then come back.

245
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,734
You all set?
Yeah.

246
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,603
All right. This is Manny.

247
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,638
Hey.
How you doin'?

248
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,674
How are ya? You'll be
sparring with him today.

249
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,477
Okay.

250
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,745
How much you weigh?
One-ninety.

251
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,048
You know that I fight
at junior welter, right?

252
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,717
I know. Headgear's
in the locker by the wall.

253
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,050
That's enough.

254
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,587
- That's enough!

255
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,601
Get on.
Why?

256
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,838
What "why?" Why not?
Gotta know where we're starting.

257
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,974
I'm not in camp or nothing.
I haven't been training.

258
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,410
Let's see.
All right.

259
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,915
There's no point.
I'm gonna be way over.

260
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,291
You just fought at 140
two weeks ago. You eat a horse?

261
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,960
I told you,
i haven't been training.

262
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,862
Geez. That's not what
I usually weigh.

263
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,834
I'm not at my fight weight
right now.

264
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,637
Hey, vinny,
i just saw you use your weight.

265
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,472
It wasn't slowing you down.
At all.

266
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,377
I don't need to cut corners,
kev. I can make weight.

267
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,779
Maybe you're at your weight.

268
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,782
Cuttin' corners is
what you been doin'.

269
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,552
- I won my first world title...
- As a lightweight. I know.

270
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,088
First time I got laid was
in my high school parking lot.

271
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,891
You see me taking my wife there every
time I want to get my rocks off?

272
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,726
Look at you.

273
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,561
You're a different fighter.
Your body's changed.

274
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,296
You're bigger.
You hit with more power.

275
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,233
Think I should move up?

276
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,968
Hey.

277
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,172
Welterweight?

278
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,944
Junior middle? Are you nuts?
You're outta your head, kev.

279
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,513
Come on.
Nobody jumps two classes.

280
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,582
That's... no, no,
that's a huge risk,

281
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,624
which is the exact opposite of what
everybody tells me i should be doing now.

282
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,989
It's a risk.

283
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,761
This is the clock.

284
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,464
It's gonna teach you
how to move in time.

285
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,601
Jesus Christ!
What's that thing made out of?

286
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,704
Rock maple. And you don't get
to hit the clock back neither.

287
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,040
Not yet. I only want you
to avoid it for now.

288
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,711
Bend your knees.
Move your head.

289
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,880
Right, left. Move your head.
Left, right.

290
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,682
After you throw a punch,
you move your head.

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,154
You look like
a two-by-four.

292
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:42,600
Now. Come on, vinny.
Move your head. Come on.

293
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,068
Look at it. Anticipate it.

294
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,704
Punch, move. Punch, move.

295
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,778
I got this. Come on.

296
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,251
Down. Here we go.

297
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,588
That's it, that's it.
Move to the side and boom!

298
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,790
Sit down on it.

299
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,702
Bad intentions. Bad intentions.

300
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,641
Now you're moving. Bend your knees.
Keep your hands up. Good.

301
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,244
You're looking good now.
You're moving your head.

302
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,950
All right, stop.

303
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,819
Okay, that's good.
Vinny, vinny, stop!

304
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,920
What?
Stop.

305
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,730
What is that?

306
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:47,131
Huh?

307
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,532
What?

308
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,634
You fight the same way.

309
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:54,205
It's like if you're not completely spent,
then you must not have tried hard enough.

310
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,808
Yeah. I don't mind the pain.
Good, 'cause it's comin'.

311
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,910
You don't have to
send out invitations.

312
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,979
You know, you can't brawl
at this weight.

313
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,548
You have to box.
You have to defend.

314
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,218
Yeah, my offense is my defense.
Oh, yeah?

315
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,655
Where'd you come up with that gem?
Don shula's autobiography?

316
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,792
Listen to me. Some hits you
aren't being tough by taking.

317
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,329
So when I say stop, you stop.

318
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:21,999
You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.

319
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,939
Put the plate down there.
You did a very good job.

320
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,274
Everything's fine.
Everything's good.

321
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,475
I think it looks lovely.

322
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,323
Your ma religious, vin?
Yeah.

323
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,026
What do you think, kev?

324
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,765
Spiritual.

325
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,635
Yeah.

326
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,510
Christ and elephants.

327
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,482
You did perfect. The knife
goes on the outside. Oh.

328
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,918
Hey.
You made it.

329
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,420
Oh! Oh, and, honey,
you look great.

330
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,155
Thank you.
Great.

331
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,391
- And, mom, this is Kevin.
- Mrs. pazienza.

332
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,626
Thank you for taking
such good care of my boy.

333
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,629
- It's nothing. I like your elephants.
- Oh, those are mine.

334
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,531
Yeah. I love elephants.

335
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,670
Yeah, hi.
I'm, uh, vinny's sister, Doreen.

336
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,772
And this is
my retarded fiancé, Jon.

337
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,908
- Fuck's wrong with you?
- Be quiet, huh?

338
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,144
- And this is... -oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember.

339
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,413
- Hi, Shelly.
- Actually, it's Heather.

340
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,248
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- How are you?

341
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,684
- Mr. pazienza.
- No, Angelo.

342
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,186
Angelo. Nice to meet you.
Hey, sweetheart.

343
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,321
Hey, pop.
Champ.

344
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,989
Hey, how you doing?

345
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,591
Jesus, you're huge.

346
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,192
Yeah.
Where you at, 150?

347
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,361
Uh, 154. Yeah.
What are you doing?

348
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,798
No, it's a good thing. Trust me.
Kevin knows what he's doing. Yeah.

349
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
What are we having for dinner?

350
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,635
All right, everybody,
sit down. Come on.

351
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:06,537
Here, you sit over here.
Doreen, serve the salad.

352
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,439
Sorry. Sit down.

353
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,341
There you go. That's right.

354
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,309
I got it,
i got it. Sit.

355
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,978
Babe, you good?

356
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,846
What else you need?
I think I'm good.

357
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,248
Everybody, sit.
All right.

358
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,855
Settled in all right?
Oh, yeah.

359
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,390
Uh, thanks.

360
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,159
You got everything you need?

361
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,662
That mattress is brand-new
that we put in for you.

362
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,964
Oh, yeah?

363
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,432
No, I'm good.

364
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,106
So, let me ask you.

365
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,210
Who told you to come in here
with your missionary bullshit

366
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,811
and change the whole program?

367
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,715
Behind my back no less.

368
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,685
It wasn't a secret or nothin'.
If vinny didn't tell you...

369
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,120
I'll deal with vinny.

370
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,722
I'm talking to you,

371
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,091
and I'm telling you that pushing
him up two weight classes

372
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,227
is a dangerous fuckin' move.

373
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,897
How do you expect the duvas
to find him a match?

374
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,234
That's their job.

375
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,738
Vinny made this decision,
Mr. pazienza.

376
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,107
I don't know why you're so worried.
He's a great fighter.

377
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,944
Yeah, I know
he's a great fighter.

378
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,845
He was a great fighter
before he met you.

379
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,018
All right, you be first.
You be first.

380
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,288
There you go.

381
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,991
All right.
That's enough.

382
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,492
Huh?
That's enough.

383
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,160
You tired?
No, I'm fine.

384
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,296
- Yeah, let's go one more round.
- Hey, vinny. Vinny.

385
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,664
That's enough.

386
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:17,501
Kev.
Don't kev me. Come on.

387
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,470
Come back tomorrow.
Okay, see ya.

388
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:22,973
Hey, champ, kev. My office.
Both of youse.

389
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,543
All right.

390
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:33,917
Sit.

391
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,425
The fight came in.

392
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,794
Hey.

393
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:47,698
And it's a fuckin' title bout.

394
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,366
Are you serious?
Yeah.

395
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,336
- Who?
- It's the French guy. "Deal."

396
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,272
Delé? Oh, yeah, delé. Whatever.

397
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,775
He's back in.
With a title fight!

398
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,178
Kev, you hear that?

399
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,113
I got a title fight.

400
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,216
I got a title fight, baby!
Are you kidding me?

401
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,552
Come on!
Get back to work!

402
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,020
You're back in the game!

403
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,089
Come on! Yeah!

404
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,001
It's bad enough
you're promoting both fighters,

405
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,804
but you made a deal for delé to fight
rossi in Europe in three months.

406
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,238
250k.

407
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:30,908
And we both know

408
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,377
he's only worth that much
if it's a unifying title fight.

409
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,980
You need vinny to lose.

410
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,583
It's worth just as much
to us if vinny wins.

411
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,186
Make delé/rossi the undercard,

412
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,521
put vinny in the ring
with sugar ray or durán.

413
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:47,057
Durán!
That's a big fuckin' if.

414
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,130
Did you buy your tickets
to Italy yet?

415
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,166
Huh? I'll bet you did.

416
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,737
Nah. It's too soon.

417
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,506
Forget using vinny
as a stepping-stone.

418
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,508
You're making him
a fuckin' doormat.

419
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:08,178
We had options at 140.

420
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,048
At 54, our hands are tied.
You said you wanted a fight.

421
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,118
Yeah, a fight.
You're sending him to the lions.

422
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,620
I thought he was coming here to
bring us a bottle of champagne.

423
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,957
I just talked to Angelo.

424
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,593
It don't sound like nobody over
there's too upset. Just you.

425
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,962
Go home, kev.
Relax.

426
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,830
This is good.
For who?

427
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,770
You didn't finish his career
in Vegas, you're doing it now.

428
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,974
We are? We were
the ones who asked for this?

429
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,643
We were the ones who bumped him
up two weight classes?

430
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,046
We're the ones who wanted
to make a big splash

431
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,882
so that the world
could know Rooney's back?

432
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,318
I mean, this is on you, kev.

433
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,562
<i>Vinny pazienza is hoping to find
some stability and consistency</i>

434
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,099
<i>at his new 154-pound home.</i>

435
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:05,569
<i>Vinny pazienza has perhaps one last
shot to win a world championship</i>

436
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:10,073
<i>when he takes on undefeated wba junior
middleweight champ Gilbert delé.</i>

437
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,276
<i>When delé won the title
in February,</i>

438
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:15,078
<i>he coldcocked a helpless
opponent named Carlos Elliott.</i>

439
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,284
<i>Elliott left on a stretcher,
facedown with a broken jaw.</i>

440
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,486
Well, good news is
he hits like a girl.

441
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,355
<i>The Providence civic center.</i>

442
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:28,258
<i>Fighting here has been one of
vinny pazienza's greatest dreams</i>

443
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
<i>since becoming
a professional boxer.</i>

444
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,529
<i>Well, it's no longer a dream.</i>

445
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,732
<i>Coming up:
Vinny pazienza, the homecoming.</i>

446
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,104
Gilbert is cool, nice, uh...

447
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,273
Well, you know
he's a very fine guy.

448
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:48,278
He's a fine guy, but, uh,
he's a rough, rough, rough guy.

449
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,181
What does that mean?
Does he got rough hands?

450
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,983
My mom owns a salon in cranston.

451
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,818
He can get a manicure
if that's the problem.

452
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,827
Gilbert says, uh, he can, uh,

453
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:07,164
kick your Italian ass
in any country you like.

454
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,569
Yeah, well, not this one, Gilbert.
All right?

455
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,006
You're stepping in front of Providence.
You're stepping in front of my people.

456
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,509
I've worked really hard to get here, and
I'm not going anywhere without that belt.

457
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,288
He wishes you the best of luck.

458
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,901
Hey!
Come on.

459
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,614
Come on, kev. Turn the music up.
I'm feeling good.

460
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,683
I want you fresh for tomorrow.
Come on.

461
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,919
- All right, all right.
- Come on, Jon.

462
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,488
He asked me to hold the bag.
You want me to say no?

463
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,393
Come on, man.

464
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:11,395
What?

465
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:12,529
This fight...

466
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,099
We gotta be careful.

467
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,602
Yeah. Kev, you bumped me up
two weight classes.

468
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,405
It's the night before the fight.
You're telling me to be careful?

469
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,506
No kiddin'.

470
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,779
What are you doing? How is
this supposed to help anybody?

471
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,814
I could ask you the same question.
It's 9:30.

472
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,283
I mean, come on.

473
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,423
Kev, look. I get it. You need
this win as much as I do.

474
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,092
You're damn right
i need this win.

475
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,828
But this isn't about me.
It's about you.

476
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,298
You're all in, all the time.
Scares the shit out of me.

477
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,002
What you want me to do? Only be half in?
A quarter in?

478
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,171
You want me to smoke
a cigarette between rounds?

479
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,341
I want you to understand the difference
between a risk and a gamble.

480
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,477
Yeah, risks, gambles, whatever.
No, not whatever.

481
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,080
This, what we do here,
this is calculated. Okay?

482
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,215
We weigh the odds.
We make a choice.

483
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,053
This ain't Blackjack, vinny.

484
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,325
It ain't orange juice
and tit jobs and sunglasses.

485
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,593
This is it.

486
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,895
This is fucking it!

487
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,069
Do you think I'm gonna
lose this fight?

488
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,407
No.

489
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,410
Good. Me neither.

490
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,756
<i>They come from
opposite ends of the spectrum.</i>

491
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:24,995
<i>Suave, smooth gentleman from
Paris, the champion, Gilbert delé.</i>

Come on, champ!

496
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,415
You be first, vinny.
You be first.

497
00:36:01,093 --> 00:36:02,492
Come on, vinny!

498
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,127
Come on. Let's go.

499
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,730
<i>No punches thrown.</i>
Come on, vin.

500
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,775
Oh!

501
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,414
Push off the ropes!

00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,353
<i>He nails pazienza upstairs.</i>

503
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,762
Get off the ropes!
Push off the ropes, vinny!

504
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,984
Come on. What are you doing?

505
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,605
There you go.

506
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,748
<i>Golden opportunity for

507
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,617
Doreen, why you so quiet?

508
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,489
Come on! Come on!
Fuck is he doing?

509
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:12,095
I'll be here all day. I love it.
I can do this all day.

510
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,463
I'll see you right after this.

511
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,000
Come on!
What are you doing, champ?

512
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,002
Stop playing around!

513
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,005
Come on!
Give me the water.

514
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,342
This isn't the game plan,
all right?

515
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,944
Why you going
toe-to-toe with this guy?

516
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,247
Hey, vinny, look at me.

517
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,450
You don't move,
you're gonna get hurt.

518
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,851
All right?
You're gonna get hurt.

519
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,592
Don't let the fillies
get the better of you.

520
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,494
You don't have to slug
with this guy, all right?

521
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,531
What?

522
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,301
What is it? He doesn't
hit like a girl at all.

523
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:53,169
Jesus Christ.

524
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,606
He actually hits pretty hard.

525
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,541
Vinny, move your head.

526
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,711
All right? Come on!
Vinny, kick his fuckin' ass!

527
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,021
There you go. There you go.

528
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,898
There you go, there you go.
Now you're movin'.

529
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,636
Oh, yeah!

530
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,076
Yeah, that's vinny. Yes!

531
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,213
Stay on him, champ!
Come on!

532
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,257
Vin, stay on him.
That's it. Yes!

533
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Come on!

534
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,272
Whoo!
Yeah!

535
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,342
What are you doing? Come on!

536
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,712
What?

537
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,215
Come on, vinny! Come on!
Finish him off!

538
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,023
No way!

539
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,157
<i>Could be the knockout!</i>

540
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,425
Neutral corner.

541
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,836
Nine, ten.

542
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,709
Ma, he did it!

543
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,878
Ma, he just did it!

544
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,381
He knocked him out!
He knocked him out? Oh, my god!

545
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,057
Champ!
Vinny! How ya doin'?

546
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,925
Oh!
Vinny!

547
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,661
- Oh, my god!
- Whoo!

548
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,196
Oh, my god, he did it!

549
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,132
Yeah!

550
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,001
- Stuck it out, vinny.
- Yeah.

551
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,271
I did it with dogged determination
and persistent perseverance.

552
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:11,274
I'm back on top.
How do you feel, champ?

553
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:14,244
Like I should be on a box of wheaties
doin' a gatorade commercial.

554
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,714
I feel like I should be going
to Disneyland or something.

555
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,182
I'm so happy.

556
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,615
So what? You bulk up.
No big deal.

557
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,116
It's durán.

558
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,018
You have to fight him
at super middleweight.

559
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,787
Yeah, you think
i can handle him?

560
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,156
I'd rather you fight
where you naturally live.

561
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,959
Don't want you to have to
starve yourself or bulk up.

562
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,094
But, yeah.
You can handle him.

563
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,363
"Handle him"?
He's gonna murder him.

564
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,799
You're too fuckin' nervous,
Kevin. You know that?

565
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,901
Yeah, you're not nervous enough.

566
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,004
Yo.

567
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,806
- Hey, hey, you got it?
- She's outside.

568
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,274
Nice.

569
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,376
Where you goin'?

570
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,346
We're just going to dunkin'.
Yeah, grab some coffee.

571
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,181
- All right.
- Okay.

572
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,684
You be back for dinner.

573
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,587
He just got this new car, pops. I
might be a little late for dinner.

574
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,842
Does this mean
we're not going to ac?

575
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:28,111
Nah, I gotta be back tonight.
Let's just do foxwoods.

576
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,748
Hey, so did you figure out
your next fight?

577
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,817
Gonna skip the rematch with delé and
go in straight to something bigger.

578
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:35,819
How big?

579
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,787
Like durán big.

580
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,190
Holy shit. How much?

581
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,325
Jimmy!

582
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,508
Vinny. Vinny.

583
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,311
Vinny?

584
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,379
Fuck!

585
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,415
Hey. Hey!

586
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,819
Call a fuckin' ambulance!
Just call...

587
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,967
You see the way he hits now?
Like a fucking bull.

588
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,003
Come on. Deal.

589
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:04,440
Hey, so quiet tonight, Anthony.
I almost forgot you were there.

590
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,809
I came to play cards, not to
hear about your fuckin' kid.

591
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,244
Yeah, fuck you!

592
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,348
Hey, Angelo!
Vinny's on TV!

593
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,151
Jesus Christ already.

594
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,021
<i>Good evening. Rhode Island's
own pazmanian devil</i>

595
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:22,025
<i>is in Kent county memorial hospital
tonight with a fractured neck.</i>

596
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,527
<i>News watch 10
has obtained these photographs</i>

597
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:28,131
<i>taken at the accident scene
not long after it happened.</i>

598
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:32,468
<i>They show the car in which vinny pazienza
was riding, as well as the other car...</i>

599
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,506
Here at Kent county hospital as
friends and family are gathering

600
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:40,476
to see what actually happened in
the accident involving pazienza.

601
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:42,612
Kent county hospital,
I'm Ted wayman.

602
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,920
Champ?

603
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,926
Champ.
No, honey, he can't.

604
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,763
They got him all drugged up
'cause he couldn't breathe.

605
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,300
What happened to him?

606
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,371
He got hit by a car.

607
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,907
No, wh-what happened to him?

608
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:15,111
Angelo, sit down.

609
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,497
Champ?

610
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,300
Pop?
Yeah, I'm here.

611
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,370
Pop?
Yeah.

612
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,173
Yeah?

613
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,909
Your breath is killin' me.

614
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:22,712
Oh! Thank you, god.

615
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,784
How you feel?
Like I should be on a box of wheaties.

616
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,564
Why am I in this thing?

617
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,034
Why?

618
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,905
You were in an accident.

619
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,174
Your neck's broke.

620
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,676
What are you talking about?

621
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:54,877
No, it's not.

622
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,750
Pop, i...

623
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,287
What are you talking about?
Ma, stop crying.

624
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,721
I'm gonna get the doctor.

625
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,492
I feel fine.

626
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,360
You're not fine, vinny.

627
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:15,164
The break on the c3 is less than an
eighth of an inch from your spinal cord.

628
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,167
You don't need to be a radiologist
to see this is a problem.

629
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,002
Vinny, you're seriously injured.

630
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,238
This is going to be
a long road to recovery.

631
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,475
How much time?

632
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,277
How much time, what?

633
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,213
How much time till
i can fight again?

634
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,181
- Vinny...
- What?

635
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,384
Doc, how much time
till I can fight again?

636
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,855
This is not the time to be talking
about... ma. Please, let him answer.

637
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:41,991
I can't say with any certainty
you're going to walk again.

638
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,961
What are you talking about?
I can feel everything.

639
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,863
I feel fine. Look.
Nurse.

640
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:48,831
I'm moving my toe.
Look, I can feel that.

641
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,500
- Vinny, calm down. Calm down.
- I feel all this stuff.

642
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,469
I can move everything.
What are you talking about?

643
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,137
I feel that!

644
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,506
- I feel fine!
- Vinny! Vinny!

645
00:47:57,508 --> 00:48:00,476
Lift my leg if you want me to.
I feel fine, doc.

646
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,712
- Stop.
- Feel my hand right there.

647
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:05,581
What you talkin' about? Kev,
tell 'em I'm gonna fight again.

648
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,551
You tell 'em!
Kevin, just tell them...

649
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,539
How you feeling, vinny?
Fine.

650
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:33,542
Listen. I want to talk to you
one more time about your options

651
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:35,244
before we proceed tomorrow.

652
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,746
No need.

653
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,181
Well, if I install the halo,

654
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,083
there's no guarantee
that it will work.

655
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,020
The halo relies solely
on your body healing on its own.

656
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:46,455
Well, that's good,
because I heal fast.

657
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:49,625
Not that fast. It'll be six months
till you're really out of danger.

658
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,228
Until then, one bump, one fall,

659
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,098
any kind of movement and
your spinal cord could sever.

660
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,201
Any doctor in the world would be
telling you that spinal fusion

661
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:02,605
is really the preferred procedure
with this severe of an injury.

662
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:07,043
You already told me all this. You
and my mom would get along great.

663
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:11,580
If you let me do the fusion, i can
guarantee you'll be able to walk again.

664
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,149
That's not enough for me.

665
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,552
I need to be able
to fight again.

666
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,254
I need you to understand
the risk...

667
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,922
I understand.

668
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,390
I don't think you do.

669
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,194
You're not fusing my neck.

670
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,673
I want you to count backwards
from ten, vinny.

671
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,509
Didn't they tell you
I'm a boxer?

672
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,912
Eight, seven... not sure
if you know this, but...

673
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,349
Six, five...

674
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,051
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Four, three...

675
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,320
Two...

676
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,888
Where's my ma?

677
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,694
Okay, let's lift the head.

678
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,156
Okay.

679
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,370
- Careful.
- You okay?

680
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,873
- That's him.
- Let's go, guys!

681
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:55,611
Come on. Let's go!

682
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,379
Come on, Kevin.
Get in the car.

683
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,315
Let's go.

684
00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:00,716
Come on.

685
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,351
- There he is.
- Get outta here.

686
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,155
Get outta here.
Come on, come on.

687
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,157
Get outta here.

688
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,960
Come on. Hey.
Get outta here.

689
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,863
You're gonna get run over
by the car. Come on!

690
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,871
Here. Nah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

691
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,611
Ow!
Christ!

692
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,980
Come on. Let me help you! Let
me help you, for Christ's sake!

693
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:33,215
Dad, get off me! Stop.

694
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,085
Come on, champ.
Come on.

695
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,389
All right?

696
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,093
Yeah.

697
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:47,196
Here, vinny.
Nah, I'm not getting in that thing again.

698
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,064
Come on.
Nah, put it away.

699
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,602
It's a, uh...
It's a craftmatic.

700
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,199
We got your room all
set up down here in the den.

701
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:32,134
Yeah, I saw that.

702
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:34,937
Brought your posters
down and everything.

703
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,138
Thanks, Jon.

704
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,944
- What do you need?
- Where's the parm?

705
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:43,178
I got it.

706
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,351
I appreciate what you guys are
doing, but I'm not handicapped.

707
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,555
We left the wheelchair
in the car.

708
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:57,293
We just want to make sure that
you don't hurt yourself, vin.

709
00:54:57,295 --> 00:54:58,961
What are you tryin'
to prove gettin' up?

710
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,596
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

711
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,898
If I would've asked you
to get the parm a week ago,

712
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,700
you would have told me
to go fuck myself. Hey!

713
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,738
All right. Yeah, that's fair.
There's your parm.

714
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,608
Vinny,
I've got two color appointments.

715
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,610
Then I'm gonna come home
and make you lunch.

716
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:16,612
- Thanks.
- Okay.

717
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,148
Get some rest, champ.

718
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,250
I thought the kids
were gonna be by today.

719
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,444
<i>Just curious. You kind of
wonder about these things.</i>

720
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:50,546
<i>Time may be running
out for the Red Sox.</i>

721
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,721
You like that?
Yeah, I do.

722
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:00,823
Mm-hmm? Yeah, it's like
a little jungle gym.

723
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:02,891
Yeah, swing around on it.

724
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,727
- Yeah?
- -Go crazy.

725
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,662
I don't want to hurt you.
You won't hurt me.

726
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,163
Hey!

727
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,032
Give me a kiss.
Ow!

728
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,001
What? Yeah.
Come on.

729
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:16,305
Mmm. Vin?

730
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:17,673
What?

731
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:20,075
My fuckin' hair's caught
in your fuckin' thing!

732
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,477
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

733
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,412
Ow!
Yeah, I got you.

734
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,347
We don't need to kiss.
Look at my hair now!

735
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,049
No, you look good.
I'm sorry.

736
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,651
No. I can't do this.

737
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:32,755
Yeah, we don't have to kiss.
We'll figure something else out.

738
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,356
Where you going? Come here. No.

739
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,425
Come here.

740
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:39,695
That's not nice. You can't just
come over and tease me like that.

741
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:41,697
Vinny... I'm all...
you know I'm right.

742
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,065
I gotta tell you.
What?

743
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,099
That thing?
Yeah?

744
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,934
It's freakin' me out.

745
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,770
I don't know what
you want me to do.

746
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:49,705
Call me when
it's like a sweater.

747
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,607
Are you serious?
Yeah.

748
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,176
You rest.
Yeah.

749
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,211
You need to rest. Yeah, I know.
I've rested plenty.

750
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:58,747
I need to not rest.
Yeah, don't come back.

751
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,083
- All right.
- You kiss me like that.

752
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:03,619
Fuck.

753
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,897
<i>For some time.</i>

754
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,767
<i>Midnight madness
became march madness.</i>

755
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,470
<i>Welcome to the Providence
basketball redemption tour.</i>

756
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:59,842
<i>Early season wins in Alaska...</i>

757
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,011
Hey, kev. Hey.
Vinny.

758
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,915
This is how you're
spending your birthday?

759
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,584
Yeah, you know.

760
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,285
Come on.

761
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,488
Get dressed.
I'm taking you out.

762
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,922
I don't wanna.

763
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,758
Come on.

764
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,926
Nah.

765
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,763
Let's go. Come on. Mm-mm-mmm.

766
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:24,299
Mm-mm-mmm.
Oh! Yeah.

767
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:28,103
Mmm! Yeah.

768
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,038
Let's go! Come on!
Gonna have fun tonight.

769
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,541
Do the elevator.
We'll do the elevator.

770
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:34,610
Look at that.
Come on.

771
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:37,646
Mm-mm-mmm. God, kev,
you're scarring me. Stop.

772
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:39,848
Come on. Come on.
I can't...

773
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,784
I can't unsee what I just saw.
Get up. There you go.

774
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,620
Oh. Good to see you.
Happy birthday, kid.

775
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:47,055
Thank you.
I almost forgot.

776
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,305
All right, now hold on. Yeah.

777
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:04,806
All right, come on.

778
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:08,877
There you go.
Kev, come on.

779
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,847
What's with the moping? Come on.
Get me outta this thing!

780
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:15,217
My god. Why couldn't you
drive a minivan?

781
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,719
Oh, my god. This...

782
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,354
All right.

783
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:21,490
Hey, what...
Why are we going here?

784
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:23,825
What? I'm gonna know
everybody in here.

785
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:26,929
You won't know anyone. It's a Tuesday.
Only skanks and hos work Tuesdays.

786
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:28,230
Oh, you may know everyone.

787
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,871
Surprise!

788
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:39,775
Hey.
Vinny!

789
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,978
Happy birthday.

790
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,416
He had no idea!

791
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:49,585
Why do they call it an island?

792
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,954
It's not an actual island.
It's named after an island.

793
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:54,423
- Yes, rhodes.
- Yes, the island of rhodes.

794
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,592
Yes. See? Like Cape Cod.
I mean nantucket.

795
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,428
- Hey!
- That has nothin' to do with it.

796
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,598
Here you are, champ.
This is it.

797
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,266
Huh?

798
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,534
Vinny!

799
01:00:05,536 --> 01:00:07,536
This is it.

800
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:10,172
- Yeah.
- Vinny!

801
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,909
Oh.

802
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,210
- Yeah.
- Look at that.

803
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:16,712
- Huh?
- Beautiful.

804
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:18,280
Really nice.

805
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,282
"Wba junior
middleweight champ."

806
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,018
All right.

807
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,788
Uh, yeah, thanks, guys.

808
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,424
It really means a lot to me

809
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:32,260
everybody showing up here
and supporting me.

810
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:35,130
I just want to say thank you.
It really means a lot.

811
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,398
And to vinny!
Yeah!

812
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,138
<i>- Salute! Salute!</i>
- To vinny!

813
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,810
What's the cake like?

814
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,082
<i>This whole thing's a machine.</i>

815
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:58,253
When the machine runs,
it feeds everybody.

816
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:01,016
When it's down, when it ain't runnin',
nobody eats. Do you understand?

817
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,794
The machine...
It don't stop for nobody.

818
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,997
Not for me, not for Don
King, not even for you.

819
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,833
We know you still have three
months to defend your title.

820
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,137
We're asking you
to give that up now, vin.

821
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:18,040
Defending your title in march
is just not a possibility.

822
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:22,310
Sometimes you gotta cut your losses
to count your gains. Am I right?

823
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:25,013
You got your belt. Everybody
knows you're the champ.

824
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,582
It ain't personal.

825
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,919
Hey.

826
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,255
Happy birthday.

827
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,956
Thanks.

828
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,803
What'd those two dum-dums
want from you?

829
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:49,504
Ah, nothin'.

830
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,840
Huh?
Nothin'.

831
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,375
You all right? Yeah. I'm fine.

832
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,444
What's up?

833
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,579
Hey.

834
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,315
We're not done here, vinny.

835
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:04,386
We're not?
No.

836
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,689
We just need to, you know,
figure out what's next for you.

837
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,791
There's a whole world
outside the ring.

838
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:13,929
You know, kev...

839
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,492
I'm getting pretty sick of people
talking about me like I'm dead.

840
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,170
Like I died in that car wreck.

841
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,973
Like it's just over for me.

842
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,644
Kev, I'm gonna fight again.

843
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,516
No, you ain't, vinny.

844
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,455
That's what everybody
here knows.

845
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,324
They're afraid to say it
to your face.

846
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,829
You're not gonna fight again.
It's over.

847
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,166
You gotta let it go.

848
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,644
Make sure my folks
get home all right.

849
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,472
Twin river.

850
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,919
Jesus, vinny.
Hey. I know.

851
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,288
And I can't even park
in the handicap spot.

852
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,757
How you feeling, honey?
Ah, I'm feelin' good.

853
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,926
Yeah. Thank you.
You look good.

854
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:52,328
Good to have you back,
Mr. pazienza.

855
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,168
Hey. Hey, guys,

856
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,536

01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:04,206
I'm vinny paz.
Oh, yeah? Hi.

858
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:06,441
- Can you take this off the table?
- Yeah. Sure.

859
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:20,789
Twenty-two.

860
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,735
Easy. Easy, Kevin.
Easy, easy, easy.

861
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:36,705
Your cab's coming. Wait right here.
I don't want a cab!

862
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,974
I know you don't, but you're gonna get one.
Just stand here...

863
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,876
All right! I'm not
gonna get in the car!

864
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,578
Stay away from that car, Kevin!

865
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,947
Don't go in that car!
Kevin, don't do it!

866
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,951
- Yeah, right.
- Come on back.

867
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,490
Ah, Jesus Christ!

868
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:57,759
Come on.

869
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,629
Hit me.

870
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,406
I'm sorry, vinny.

871
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:23,919
Yeah.

872
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,882
It's coming up right up here.

873
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,140
- Vinny?
- What?

874
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,113
What are you doing down there?

875
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,949
I don't know.

876
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,480
Come on, pazman.

877
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,483
Let's go.

878
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,306
Ow!

879
01:08:31,308 --> 01:08:32,841
Fuck!

880
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:56,097
Ah.

881
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,495
Let's go. Come on.

882
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,131
Come on!

883
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,734
Come on, vinny.
Come on, paz.

884
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,236
Come on.

885
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,086
Come on.

886
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:56,824
Come on.

887
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,526
Come on, paz. Let's go, baby.

888
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,282
Let him sleep.
He was probably up readin'.

889
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,688
Readin'? Why are you
this stupid?

890
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,656
<i>Three seconds to go
in the third.</i>

891
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:32,393
<i>It has been all so far.</i>

892
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:36,164
<i>- The crowd erupts in Providence.</i>

893
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,602
- Hey.
- Hey.

894
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:43,304
What you watching? Just watching
the fights a little bit.

895
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,874
So, you get any action
at county or what?

896
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:48,776
Fuck off.

897
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,578
Jesus.
When'd you get out?

898
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,280
Nah, I never went in.

899
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:55,116
I got released,
after twelve hours.

900
01:10:55,118 --> 01:10:59,387
Friggin' lost my license. On probation.
Fucking stupid.

901
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:02,557
- I'm glad you came over.
- No, I should've come by sooner.

902
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,262
Be right back. Gonna say
hi to your mom. Hold on.

903
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:09,931
Let me, uh... let me talk to you
about something real quick.

904
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,466
What?

905
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,603
I need your help.

906
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,438
What happened?

907
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,707
You in trouble?
What, gambling?

908
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,242
Nah, nah. You need money? What?

909
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:22,677
Nah, none of that stuff.

910
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,083
Vinny, come on. What? Say it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

911
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:30,885
I know. I'm just
gonna show you.

912
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:34,522
Vin, come on.
What, you buy a new Jean jacket?

913
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,163
I need you to start
training me again.

914
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,367
Fuck you.

915
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,370
Right?

916
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,243
Stop it.
I'm serious.

917
01:11:55,245 --> 01:11:57,245
I see that.

918
01:11:57,247 --> 01:12:00,148
Come on. Sooner or later, you got
to start accepting that maybe...

919
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,050
Look, I already started, kev.

920
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,553
Started what?
With just the bar.

921
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,157
Now, I've been going real slow,

922
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,326
and I haven't rushed through
anything, just like you taught me.

923
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:13,027
Vinny, vinny, ho, ho, ho, vinny.

924
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,962
Vinny, no. No!

925
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:17,131
What? What are you doing?
This is insane.

926
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:21,202
You looked in the mirror lately?
You see that thing on your head?

927
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,940
You heard what the doctor said.
You're risking your life here.

928
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,308
What life?

929
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,743
Upstairs?

930
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,848
No, I can't do it.

931
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,485
- This is a fucking hail Mary at best.
- No, it's... no, it's no...

932
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:40,555
It's a gamble.
Yeah, I know that.

933
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:43,825
But if there was a time to
roll the dice, this is it.

934
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:47,528
- You just don't know how to give up.
- No, I do.

935
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,897
Trust me, I do. I know
exactly how to give up.

936
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,368
You know what scares the shit out
of me, kev? It's that it's easy.

937
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:58,906
Something goes wrong
and I'm involved,

938
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,375
I couldn't live with that.

939
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,053
Whose turn? Doreen, it's your play.
Come on.

940
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:14,322
Doreen.
What?

941
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:16,391
It's your turn.
I know it's my...

942
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:19,026
Give me a second. I gotta
figure out what I'm doing.

943
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,094
Doreen.
What?

944
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:22,430
Come on. You're up.
Oh, my god.

945
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,898
Your turn.
I know it's me.

946
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,501
I gotta figure out something to do.
Put this down there.

947
01:13:26,503 --> 01:13:28,536
You're awfully quiet
tonight, Kevin.

948
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:30,538
- The nine. Oh.
- I'm fine, Mrs. pazienza.

949
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,706
Jon?
It's your turn.

950
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,174
Yeah. Uh...

951
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:34,609
Isn't vinny doing great?

952
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,712
Put that there.

953
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,414
He's doing great.

954
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,815
It's you, vin.

955
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,185
What's this?
This is all...

956
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:46,421
Kev, you think drinking's
such a good idea right now?

957
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:52,126
You're gonna lecture me
on moderation?

958
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:54,429
- Balls on this kid.
- Yeah, vin.

959
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,830
Yeah, since forever.

960
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,936
All right. Kevin, you're welcome
to stay here on the couch.

961
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,138
- Maybe you shouldn't be driving.
- No, I'm fine.

962
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:06,240
- Ma, he can't drive. He
lost his license. -Jesus.

963
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,075
Vinny!

964
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,645
- Louise? -There we go.
Okay, I got my card.

965
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:13,114
All right. Kevin, your turn.
Come on. Kevin, you're up.

966
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,716
- I'm done.
- What do you mean? No, no.

967
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,044
Kev, what are you doing?

968
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,481
Go upstairs.

969
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,050
I'm comfortable.

970
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,887
I don't think i could
make it up the stairs.

971
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,860
Where's the bench press?

972
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:00,495
I threw it in the garbage.

973
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,498
Why did you do that?

974
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:09,237
Leave it. You're a big
dummy, you know that?

975
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,207
Bench...

976
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:15,309
Good old bench-pressing.

977
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:17,745
How's that a good idea? You
should be doing shoulder work.

978
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,382
At least that would help
with your injury.

979
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:25,019
This way, you're gonna just look
like some ital on venice beach.

980
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,524
You put me in a hell of a spot.

981
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,297
Had to decide if it'd be worse to watch
you kill yourself or... Help you do it.

982
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,774
That's, like, the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

983
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,610
Sit down, asshole.

984
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,549
There you go.
Give me 50 of those.

985
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,121
There you go.
Straighten up the back.

986
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,296
You get cable with that thing?
Yeah.

987
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,108
Is this making too much noise?
Nah. We're good.

988
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,878
Come on.

989
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,780
Vinny?

990
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:28,282
Vinny, I gotta get
the Christmas box!

991
01:16:28,284 --> 01:16:30,351
Get that box
right there. Yeah, ma!

992
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:32,520
Yeah, kev's bringing it up to you.
Oh. All right.

993
01:16:32,522 --> 01:16:34,188
Here you go, Mrs. pazienza.
Yeah, he's got it.

994
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:36,123
All right.
Thank you.

995
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:38,359
What are you two
doing down there?

996
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:40,661
We're just going through
some of vinny's old things.

997
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:55,876
Ten more.

998
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,751
Come on. Keep...

999
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,588
What, you're not even counting.

1000
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,391
Five, six...

1001
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:12,293
How you feelin'?
Huh? All right.

1002
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:21,736
Hey, what happened to you?

1003
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,341
Oh, yeah, i slipped coming out
of the bathroom yesterday.

1004
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,917
Aaah!

1005
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:56,671
I like the peppers.

1006
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,339
They're good?
They're good.

1007
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,312
One day you're fightin'
and callin' each other names.

1008
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:07,214
Now you're gigglin'
like a bunch of schoolgirls.

1009
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:10,518
What the hell's the matter with you two?
I don't know, pop.

1010
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,720
- Just having a good day, i guess.
- Well, knock it off.

1011
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,228
You don't mind the
construction site on his face?

1012
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,664
Construction doesn't
last forever.

1013
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:27,034
You know, I'm actually kind of into it.
It's like braces times a thousand.

1014
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,140
I think this might be
the one, vin.

1015
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:01,035
Come on.
Do it again.

1016
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,870
Come on.
Baby, come on.

1017
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:03,971
Oh, my god.

1018
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,653
Get out of my house.

1019
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,774
You've been training under
my roof without telling me?

1020
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,512
Pop, listen... right
under my fuckin' nose.

1021
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,681
You were doing this
the whole time?

1022
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,583
Yeah.

1023
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:54,488
It's been the only thing that's kept
me alive these last few months.

1024
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,457
You lied to me, vinny.

1025
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:58,025
I lied to you?
Where were you tonight?

1026
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,661
Fuck you just say to me?

1027
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,003
I'm sorry, pop.
I didn't want you to worry.

1028
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,366
Vinny, what are you doing? We
gotta get the show on the road.

1029
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,335
Yeah, I know.
I told her I'm good.

1030
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,338
You have to be given a sedative
for me to remove the screws.

1031
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,707
No. Let's just do it.

1032
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:50,177
Vinny, I can't do this without
giving you an anesthetic.

1033
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,779
Listen... it would be
excruciatingly painful.

1034
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:54,281
Listen, doc. I've never
done drugs in my life.

1035
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:58,052
I've never taken a hit. Not a bump.
Not a drag on a joint. Nothin'.

1036
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,753
So I'm not gonna start now.

1037
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:01,922
Just take 'em out.

1038
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:03,958
You ready?

1039
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:08,562
Yeah, let's do it.

1040
01:21:08,564 --> 01:21:11,332
Holy shit, doc! You're
going the wrong way!

1041
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:12,399
I'm not, vinny.

1042
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,535
Listen.

1043
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:16,537
You sure? Feels like you
screwed it in deeper.

1044
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,572
- What do you say
we give you a sedative?

1045
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,541
No, I'm good.
Come on. I'm good.

1046
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:27,047
Oh, shit, doc! It's lefty loosey!
Do you know what you're doing?

1047
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,183
Y-yes, I know.
Thank you.

1048
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:32,086
It's the calcification around
the threads breaking free.

1049
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:34,154
It's like a rusty bolt
with loctite on it.

1050
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:37,992
Okay.

1051
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,229
All right. Let's go.

1052
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,777
Okay. Breathe.

1053
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,786
Okay, there we go. There we go.
All right.

1054
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:39,954
Okay.

1055
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,158
Piece of cake.

1056
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,193
Whoo!

1057
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,041
Okay, got it.

1058
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:15,389
Hey.

1059
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,429
Hey.

1060
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,532
I think I'm gonna be all right.
Yeah?

1061
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,001
Yeah.

1062
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:28,869
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1063
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,704
- Thank you so much for helping.
- You're welcome.

1064
01:23:30,706 --> 01:23:31,872
Hey.

1065
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:34,708
Thanks, doc.
Yeah.

1066
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,443
Thank you.
Thank you, doc.

1067
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:37,578
Get him out.

1068
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,414
Fuck me.

1069
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:14,648
Good. Good.

1070
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:20,721
How's that weight?
Mm-hmm.

1071
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:21,822
All right?

1072
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,406
<i>Sorry, vinny, it's impossible.</i>

1073
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,208
<i>I can't get anyone to
insure a fight with you.</i>

1074
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,876
Listen to me, Lou.

1075
01:24:42,878 --> 01:24:46,113
I've been busting my ass. Only
one thing got me through that.

1076
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:48,182
- Come on.
- <i>I don't care who it's with,</i>

1077
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,950
<i>where it happens,
how much money it's for.</i>

1078
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:52,219
<i>None of that.</i>
Come on, vinny.

1079
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,922
<i>I made the calls, vinny.
No one will fight you.</i>

1080
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:57,858
<i>No one wants to be the one to
send you back to the hospital.</i>

1081
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,727
<i>I don't want to be
the one to say it...</i>

1082
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,697
Then don't, 'cause I worked
too hard to hear it.

1083
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,798
<i>Vinny...</i>

1084
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,067
<i>to have any shot
at catching the Yankees.</i>

1085
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:42,503
<i>The Red Sox play three
in Detroit starting tonight.</i>

1086
01:25:42,505 --> 01:25:45,506
<i>And let's face it. At six back,
they need a minor miracle...</i>

1087
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:46,974
<i>Probably a major miracle...</i>

1088
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:48,575
<i>To win this wild card race.</i>

1089
01:25:48,577 --> 01:25:50,911
<i>Thanks, Joe. The dream lives on.</i>

1090
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:55,249
<i>Vinny paz anxiously awaiting the chance
to once again pursue his boxing dream.</i>

1091
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:58,352
<i>In the meantime, the pazman is doing
all he can to keep his body in shape</i>

1092
01:25:58,354 --> 01:25:59,953
<i>as we discovered today.</i>

1093
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,522
<i>There was always
something ironic</i>

1094
01:26:01,524 --> 01:26:04,424
<i>about seeing the pazmanian
devil wearing a halo.</i>

1095
01:26:04,426 --> 01:26:07,127
<i>But the irony is gone,
replaced by iron.</i>

1096
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:09,396
<i>Vinny pazienza
is pumping iron again.</i>

1097
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,035
Hey.
Hey.

1098
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,138
What'd you do?
Hey.

1099
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,040
I didn't know it was
gonna get this crazy.

1100
01:26:20,042 --> 01:26:22,109
Come on. We'll make it work.
Let's go.

1101
01:26:23,646 --> 01:26:24,845
No idea.

1102
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,313
Whoa.

1103
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:28,148
Hey, everybody.
How we doin'?

1104
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,551
Vinny, how you feeling?
Are you feeling good?

1105
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:32,085
Good to see you guys.

1106
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,821
Yeah.

1107
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,124
Getting that right there?
All right, vinny. Come on.

1108
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:39,026
Okay, thank you, guys.
I really appreciate it.

1109
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:40,627
Give 'em a little show. Okay.

1110
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,429
All right.
The champ is here.

1111
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,467
Hey, vinny, how you feeling?

1112
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:50,704
How am I feeling? I'm feeling
like a two-time world champion.

1113
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,807
What do you guys think? Feel like I'm
moving faster, hitting stronger?

1114
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:56,176
Looking good. When's
the next fight? Uh...

1115
01:26:56,178 --> 01:26:58,579
I don't know, but it's gonna
be... it's gonna be huge.

1116
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:01,882
- What's your weight class gonna be?
- Uh, super heavyweight.

1117
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:05,085
Uh, I don't know. It's a good question.
Kev keeps fattening me up.

1118
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:07,354
Can we get footage in the ring?
It'd be great for this piece.

1119
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,189
Yeah.

1120
01:27:09,191 --> 01:27:12,392
Love to, but we didn't set up a
sparring partner for today's work.

1121
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:13,560
All right?
Kev.

1122
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,162
You wanna see me spar? Yes!

1123
01:27:15,164 --> 01:27:17,497
You guys wanna see me spar?
Come on.

1124
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:19,766
Kev, seriously, find somebody.
I'm fine.

1125
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:23,503
And they said I'd never walk again.
Said I'd never box again.

1126
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:25,305
Hey, dino.
Go a couple of rounds?

1127
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,841
What do you mean no?

1128
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,444
Here I am six months later.
Had screws in my head.

1129
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:33,180
Got these scars. Chicks dig
scars though, right, Cindy?

1130
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,416
- José.
- Hey, time flies.

1131
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,218
José, let's go.
Get in the ring.

1132
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,021
Coming at his head...
Bah! Come on. Come on.

1133
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:42,990
Kev, how we doing?

1134
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,325
I don't know, vinny.

1135
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:48,695
Yeah.
What?

1136
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:53,300
Nobody wants to spar with me?
Let's do it another day.

1137
01:27:53,302 --> 01:27:55,736
Nah, come on.
Hey, Tommy. Come here.

1138
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:58,138
Tommy, I need you to spar with me.
Nah, I can't.

1139
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,172
Why?

1140
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:03,477
I just can't.

1141
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,046
Come on.

1142
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:08,615
Tommy. What...

1143
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,020
What, nobody wants
to spar with me?

1144
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,992
Hey.

1145
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:20,594
I'll spar with you.
Yeah?

1146
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:22,796
Yeah. Good. You're
doing a good thing.

1147
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,498
How tall are you?
Six foot.

1148
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,166
Oh, my god, you are huge.

1149
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:27,534
Come on.
You can do it.

1150
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:29,636
Come on.

1151
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:38,045
Come on, ray. What are you doing, ray?
Let's go.

1152
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,080
Come on.

1153
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,954
Come on. What are you doing?
Hit me.

1154
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:49,323
I-i can't hit you, man.

1155
01:28:49,325 --> 01:28:50,524
Why? We're not
dancing, bitch.

1156
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,295
Whoa.

1157
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,566
Are you okay?

1158
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:04,805
Yeah, I'm good.

1159
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:05,972
Thank you.

1160
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:07,607
Yeah.

1161
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:08,909
All right, champ.
Way to go.

1162
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:23,523
<i>If all goes well at the
doctor's office on the 14th,</i>

1163
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:26,360
<i>it won't be long until vinny's
back here in the ring,</i>

1164
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:30,230
<i>bobbing and weaving and sparring
his way to fighting form</i>

1165
01:29:30,232 --> 01:29:34,134
<i>as one of the most courageous comebacks
in boxing history continues.</i>

1166
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:37,204
<i>The familiar desire and
determination are still there.</i>

1167
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,139
<i>The halo has brought
a whole new appreciation...</i>

1168
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:40,707
I can sell this.

1169
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:42,744
<i>Come on.</i>

1170
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,113
This is too soon.

1171
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:50,917
Is this ma?
No.

1172
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:54,321
I mean, yeah, we talked about it. How many
times you think we had that conversation?

1173
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,759
No, this is different.
This is... me.

1174
01:29:58,761 --> 01:30:00,660
You don't think I'm ready?

1175
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:04,331
I think you're in great shape.

1176
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,632
Then what is it?

1177
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,271
This whole thing...

1178
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:13,740
The accident...

1179
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,743
It woke me up.

1180
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,845
I got a taste of what
it'd be like...

1181
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:20,814
Yeah, pop. That's what
it did for me.

1182
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:22,983
I got a taste.

1183
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:26,286
When I was lying on the cot...

1184
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:30,991
That's all I was thinking about was
what am I gonna do after this?

1185
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,161
Am I gonna train kids
at the gym?

1186
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,564
You know, bartend at night?

1187
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:40,333
Talk about how i... how I
used to be a fighter...

1188
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,669
Used to be world champ.

1189
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,175
Nah, this-this
is what I do.

1190
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:51,778
And I don't know how
not to do it.

1191
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,051
Okay.

1192
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:07,627
Look, I know you think I've been
doing a bang-up job all these years,

1193
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,130
but that ain't exactly true.

1194
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:12,933
I let you put yourself
in harm's way.

1195
01:31:12,935 --> 01:31:15,268
- I-i pushed you to it.
- No, you didn't.

1196
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,603
I did. No, you didn't do that.

1197
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:19,306
I... I did. Right?

1198
01:31:19,308 --> 01:31:23,477
And... I know it's a little late
to be making a change, but...

1199
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:24,945
What change?

1200
01:31:24,947 --> 01:31:26,313
I can't...

1201
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:28,582
Be in your corner for this one.

1202
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:31,585
Or any of them.

1203
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:35,722
I can't be part of you
getting hurt no more.

1204
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,393
Why are you doing this
right now?

1205
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,232
I should've done it
a long time ago.

1206
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:56,409
All right. Come on.

1207
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,948
Vinny.
You got a second?

1208
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,517
Yeah.
What's up, Lou?

1209
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:06,119
I got a hell
of an offer for you.

1210
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,622
I don't need a hell of an offer.
I need a fight.

1211
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:11,658
Underpromise, overdeliver.
Here comes the good news.

1212
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,194
First off, we've been trying to
get you a fight this whole time.

1213
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:16,463
Obviously, the recent press
coverage... save it, Dan.

1214
01:32:16,465 --> 01:32:19,799
What are you bringing us, Lou?
Roberto durán.

1215
01:32:19,801 --> 01:32:22,969
Ibc world super
middleweight title.

1216
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,840
$1.6 million.

1217
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:29,075
Biggest payday of your career.

1218
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:38,885
So we're good?

1219
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,322
It's up...
It's all up to kev.

1220
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,860
1.6 million.

1221
01:32:46,862 --> 01:32:49,596
Let's get it on. Yeah,
let's get it on.

1222
01:32:49,598 --> 01:32:51,598
All right.

1223
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,133
Come on.
Let's get a fight.

1224
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:54,834
Come on.

1225
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:04,077
Come on. Don't let
tension screw you.

1226
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:17,857
<i>Vinny was the man, the junior
middleweight champion of the world.</i>

1227
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:21,695
<i>When a brutal car accident left him
inches away from complete paralysis,</i>

1228
01:33:21,697 --> 01:33:24,464
<i>doctors said
he'd never box again.</i>

1229
01:33:24,466 --> 01:33:26,800
<i>Doctors told him, "you'll never
walk again, let alone fight."</i>

1230
01:33:26,802 --> 01:33:28,122
<i>He said,
"doc, I'm gonna fight."</i>

1231
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:31,304
<i>Doc said, "you're crazy.
He can't even walk."</i>

1232
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:32,572
<i>It's a fascinating story.</i>

1233
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:33,940
<i>Vinny pazenia.</i>

1234
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:35,609
<i>Pazenia?</i>

1235
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,745
<i>Let's say hello to him.</i>

1236
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,947
<i>Pazienza! Pazienza!</i>

1237
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,149
Oh, my god. Yeah, look at him.

1238
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:44,818
Oh!

1239
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:48,288
Oh, he looks so handsome.

1240
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,823
<i>You broke your neck.</i>

1241
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:51,992
<i>Obviously. I see you wearing
that brace there. Then what?</i>

1242
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:55,328
<i>The doctors told you you'd never even
walk again, let alone fight again.</i>

1243
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,231
<i>Never fight again, but now I'm
about to fight Roberto durán.</i>

1244
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:01,067
<i>- Yeah. -June 25th at the
mgm on pay-per-view.</i>

1245
01:34:01,069 --> 01:34:04,270
<i>We're a bit more than 48 hours away
from the showdown in las Vegas</i>

1246
01:34:04,272 --> 01:34:06,740
<i>between vinny pazienza
and Roberto durán.</i>

1247
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:10,577
<i>Durán's record, 93-9,
64 knockouts.</i>

1248
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:12,946
<i>A crushing combination
by Roberto durán.</i>

1249
01:34:12,948 --> 01:34:14,914
<i>It's scheduled for 12 rounds,</i>

1250
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:17,450
<i>and, uh, it should be
one heck of a fight.</i>

1251
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:19,486
<i>The duel in the desert.</i>

1252
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:21,921
<i>Durán. Pazienza.</i>

1253
01:35:04,332 --> 01:35:07,867
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's mano a mano.

1254
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:14,340
Twelve rounds of boxing for the ibc
super middleweight world title.

1255
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:18,478
Tonight's main event is sanctioned
by the Nevada athletic commission

1256
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,715
and the honorable
governor Bob Miller.

1257
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:26,820
First,
introducing the principals.

1258
01:35:26,822 --> 01:35:30,590
Boxing out of the blue corner,
wearing the red trunks,

1259
01:35:30,592 --> 01:35:35,161
weighing in
at an even 165 pounds.

1260
01:35:35,163 --> 01:35:37,530
From cranston, Rhode Island,

1261
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:41,735
this man is a former
two-time world champion.

1262
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:45,839
The pazmanian devil,

1263
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:48,675
vinny pazienza!

1264
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:53,913
And his opponent,
boxing out of the red corner,

1265
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,883
this man needs no introduction.

1266
01:35:56,885 --> 01:36:00,854
Wearing the black trunks
with the solid gold trim,

1267
01:36:00,856 --> 01:36:04,090
he weighed in at a fit
and fighting-ready

1268
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:07,861
165 and a half pounds.

1269
01:36:07,863 --> 01:36:12,132
Ninety-three wins,
with 64 coming by knockout.

1270
01:36:12,134 --> 01:36:15,802
He's a four-time world champion.

1271
01:36:15,804 --> 01:36:21,407
<i>¡el hijo de la república
de panamá!</i>

1272
01:36:21,409 --> 01:36:24,410
From Panama City, Panama,

1273
01:36:24,412 --> 01:36:26,713
<i>manos de piedras,</i>

1274
01:36:26,715 --> 01:36:28,448
the hands of stone,

1275
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:32,685
Roberto...

1276
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,789
Durán!

1277
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:43,596
These are dramatic moments
for vinny pazienza.

1278
01:36:43,598 --> 01:36:45,832
He has made it back
from a broken neck,

1279
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:48,902
doctors telling him
he might never walk again.

1280
01:36:48,904 --> 01:36:50,770
<i>He wore the halo for six months.</i>

1281
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:54,774
<i>The metal brace screwed
into his skull in four spots.</i>

1282
01:36:54,776 --> 01:36:58,411
<i>That he's standing in this ring
is a minor miracle in itself.</i>

1283
01:36:58,413 --> 01:37:01,181
<i>That and the fact that he's
jumped three weight classes</i>

1284
01:37:01,183 --> 01:37:04,717
<i>from where he won his first title,
that makes this a long shot at best.</i>

1285
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:08,988
All right, gentlemen.

1286
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:11,624
Went over the rules in the dressing room.
I want a good, clean fight.

1287
01:37:11,626 --> 01:37:14,594
Obey my commands at all times
and protect yourselves.

1288
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:17,197
Now tap gloves
and come out fighting.

1289
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:21,134
<i>And what is on everyone's mind
is will the neck of pazienza</i>

1290
01:37:21,136 --> 01:37:23,837
<i>hold up in a 12-round
championship fight?</i>

1291
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,672
<i>He's only sparred up until now.</i>

1292
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:29,142
<i>And these are, after all,
the hands of stone</i>

1293
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:30,577
coming at him tonight.

1294
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:37,650
Angelo pazienza
is not in vinny's corner tonight

1295
01:37:37,652 --> 01:37:40,854
for the first time
in his son's boxing career.

1296
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:19,225
- Stay! Stay!
- <i>And down goes pazienza!</i>

1297
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:25,231
He took a huge shot
on that damaged neck.

1298
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:29,435
Durán putting pazienza
on the canvas in round 1.

1299
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:33,373
Four...

1300
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:35,008
Five...

1301
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:37,377
Six.

1302
01:38:37,379 --> 01:38:41,014
Pazienza refuses to take
the entire count.

1303
01:38:41,016 --> 01:38:43,349
Not wise,
but certainly consistent.

1304
01:38:47,722 --> 01:38:50,256
How are you feeling, huh?
You gave him a free shot.

1305
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:52,725
- How's the neck?
- I'm good.

1306
01:39:02,703 --> 01:39:05,805
Every time he's gonna throw that left hook.
You're under it, back with a left.

1307
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:07,640
Move. You're bigger,
you're stronger, you're faster.

1308
01:39:07,642 --> 01:39:10,576
All right?
The guy can't even move.

1309
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:13,079
Everything off the jab. Everything
off the jab. All right?

1310
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:14,314
Put your punches together. Yeah.

1311
01:39:14,316 --> 01:39:15,949
Let's go. All right.

1312
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:18,117
Go kill him.

1313
01:39:21,156 --> 01:39:23,623
You can see it already.
Pazienza's moving well,

1314
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:26,826
but durán's catching vinny
on the way in.

1315
01:39:26,828 --> 01:39:29,729
- He can't even get close.
- Combination by durán.

1316
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,699
Move your head, vinny!
Move your head!

1317
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,034
Ooh!
Oh, god.

1318
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:42,909
Vinny, what are you doing?
Keep your hands up!

1319
01:39:42,911 --> 01:39:44,344
Give me defense!
Hey!

1320
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,913
Combination for pazienza.

1321
01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:48,648
Right hand from durán.

1322
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,988
Durán with a big right hand!

1323
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:58,591
Vinny, why you
going toe-to-toe with him?

1324
01:39:58,593 --> 01:40:01,928
And it's all durán here
in the early going.

1325
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,798
Don't slug with this guy.

1326
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,701
You're a better boxer.
Everything off the jab.

1327
01:40:08,703 --> 01:40:11,371
On to round 4.

1328
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:13,940
It's been all Roberto durán. Good
right hand there by pazienza.

1329
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,942
There you go. Follow it up.
Follow it up.

1330
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:19,846
Keep moving.
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1331
01:40:19,848 --> 01:40:24,017
Pazienza shaken by that right
hand delivered by durán.

1332
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:31,691
Use the ring! Use the ring, damn it!
What's he doing?

1333
01:40:34,061 --> 01:40:36,562
I can't watch this.
Come on! Jab!

1334
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:39,932
<i>Roberto durán
taking this fight over.</i>

1335
01:40:43,804 --> 01:40:46,005
Watch out for the hook.
Watch out for the hook.

1336
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:52,211
Every single time he's looking
for that left hook. I told you.

1337
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,913
Move away from it.
All right?

1338
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:32,585
Come on!

1339
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:35,655
As pazienza tries to get his
rhythm going in this fight.

1340
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,423
Call it.

1341
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,959
Call the fight,
for Christ's sake.

1342
01:41:39,961 --> 01:41:41,527
Not yet.

1343
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:43,729
Hey, come on!
He's dying out there!

1344
01:41:43,731 --> 01:41:44,997
Come on!

1345
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:46,666
Go sit down.

1346
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:00,646
It's all right. Just relax.
Relax. Relax, huh?

1347
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:04,851
Take a breath.

1348
01:42:08,922 --> 01:42:09,989
What'd my dad say?

1349
01:42:12,259 --> 01:42:14,026
Don't matter what he said.
All right? Okay.

1350
01:42:14,995 --> 01:42:17,296
Hey, vinny, listen to me.

1351
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:20,166
If he didn't think you could win this
without him, he'd be in the corner.

1352
01:42:20,168 --> 01:42:21,601
Yeah.

1353
01:42:21,603 --> 01:42:24,237
Vinny, we started this
in a basement.

1354
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:27,240
In a fucking basement!

1355
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:39,051
<i>Now go out there
and show me how you do things.</i>

1356
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:44,023
<i>Show me how you live.</i>

1357
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,161
<i>Show me how you fight.</i>

1358
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:52,765
Show you how I fight?

1359
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:55,568
Yeah. Show me
who the fuck you are.

1360
01:43:03,977 --> 01:43:06,445
Again, pazienza back
into the corner.

1361
01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:09,282
Durán misses!

1362
01:43:09,284 --> 01:43:12,185
Big overhand right
from pazienza.

1363
01:43:12,187 --> 01:43:13,953
There you go.
There you go.

1364
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,224
Move it. Move. Move.
You got him, vinny.

1365
01:43:18,226 --> 01:43:20,526
There you go.
Can you give him something?

1366
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,129
Get him scared.
Get him scared.

1367
01:43:23,131 --> 01:43:25,731
Go to the body, vinny.
Give him a 5-6. 5-6!

1368
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,003
Pazienza turning things
around in the seventh round.

1369
01:43:31,005 --> 01:43:34,073
5-5-1, vinny.
5-5-1. Go upstairs!

1370
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,510
Oh, my god.
The kid listened to me!

1371
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,281
That's how
you fight. Huh?

1372
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:45,151
That's how you box.

1373
01:43:45,153 --> 01:43:47,486
You're a fucking animal, vinny.

1374
01:43:47,488 --> 01:43:51,224
What a round for vinny pazienza.

1375
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:55,027
And now, this is the
pazienza we've seen before.

1376
01:43:55,029 --> 01:43:57,763
The brawling, powerful pazienza.

1377
01:43:57,765 --> 01:44:01,167
Pazienza able to land
to the chin of durán.

1378
01:44:01,169 --> 01:44:02,101
Go! Go!

1379
01:44:02,103 --> 01:44:03,302
You hear them? Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:06,339
You got him. Go!

1381
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:08,908
Pazienza with a wicked shot

1382
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,277
to the side of durán's head.

1383
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,380
These are huge moments
for vinny pazienza.

1384
01:44:14,382 --> 01:44:16,349
Delivering combinations.

1385
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:19,518
Use the jab. Nice, vinny! Put it together!
Put it together!

1386
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,189
Left hand landed by pazienza.
Another left by pazienza.

1387
01:44:23,191 --> 01:44:24,857
And a right by pazienza.

1388
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,597
<i>I don't think any of us thought
we were gonna be here now.</i>

1389
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:34,367
<i>A wild 11th round
with pazienza making</i>

1390
01:44:34,369 --> 01:44:37,403
<i>what looks like an improbable
comeback in this fight.</i>

1391
01:44:37,405 --> 01:44:40,139
<i>It is a street fight
at this point.</i>

1392
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:42,074
<i>Pazienza does not look good.</i>

1393
01:44:42,076 --> 01:44:44,877
<i>He's bleeding from everywhere.</i>

1394
01:44:44,879 --> 01:44:49,849
<i>If vinny pazienza came in with
one plan, he's got another now.</i>

1395
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:54,487
Last round.
All in, vinny.

1396
01:44:54,489 --> 01:44:56,188
All fucking in.
You hear me?

1397
01:44:56,823 --> 01:44:58,257
Now finish it.

1398
01:44:58,259 --> 01:45:00,693
That's what you do best.
You finish, all right?

1399
01:45:01,728 --> 01:45:03,129
Three minutes,

1400
01:45:03,131 --> 01:45:04,530
you're champion of the world.

1401
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,234
Three minutes.

1402
01:45:08,236 --> 01:45:10,569
Three minutes.
Yeah. Let's go.

1403
01:45:15,777 --> 01:45:17,977
<i>And here we go
with the final round.</i>

1404
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:19,578
Round 12.

1405
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:26,451
- Come on, vinny. You got this guy.
- Come on.

1406
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:37,129
Beautiful combination
by pazienza.

1407
01:45:37,131 --> 01:45:39,165
Move your feet.
Move your feet. There you go.

1408
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:42,668
Pazienza stumbling following
that right hand by durán.

1409
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,274
Vin! Vin!

1410
01:45:48,276 --> 01:45:49,775
Come on!

1411
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:56,148
This crowd that was booing
vinny pazienza

1412
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:59,251
at some moments early in
the fight, on its feet.

1413
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:05,024
Come on!
This is it! This is...

1414
01:46:05,959 --> 01:46:07,093
Come on!

1415
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:14,367
<i>I cannot believe
they're both still standing.</i>

1416
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:19,372
Come on, vinny!

1417
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:25,111
It is all over.

1418
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,948
It goes the distance.

1419
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:46,465
<i>And it's in the hands
of the judges.</i>

1420
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:52,605
Ladies and gentlemen,

1421
01:46:52,607 --> 01:46:57,042
after 12 action-packed
championship rounds of boxing,

1422
01:46:57,044 --> 01:47:01,514
I give you the scoring
by the judges as follows.

1423
01:47:01,516 --> 01:47:07,219
Judge Chuck giamba
scores the bout 114-114.

1424
01:47:07,221 --> 01:47:10,222
Judge Dave moretti
and judge Jerry roth

1425
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:15,528
both score the bout
115-113 for the winner

1426
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:21,066
and the ibc super middleweight
champion of the world,

1427
01:47:21,068 --> 01:47:26,539
vinny "the pazmanian devil"...

1428
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:28,707
<i>Pazienza!</i>

1429
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:54,126
People are calling this one of the most
unlikely comebacks in sports history.

1430
01:48:54,128 --> 01:48:56,295
What do you attribute it to?

1431
01:48:56,297 --> 01:48:59,765
Um... yeah, I don't know.
I had a lot of help.

1432
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:02,902
But you've also had
a lot of adversity.

1433
01:49:02,904 --> 01:49:05,538
You've had issues
with management,

1434
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:07,273
conflicts of interest.

1435
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:13,946
Yeah, well, the boxing world looks...
looks shiny from the outside.

1436
01:49:16,349 --> 01:49:20,152
It's filled with promises that...
most of 'em turn out to be lies.

1437
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:22,788
You can't rely on anyone.

1438
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:27,259
So what would you say
the biggest deception was?

1439
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:29,128
What was the biggest lie
you were told?

1440
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:34,800
It's not that simple.

1441
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:37,269
Why not?

1442
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:39,638
No, that's the biggest lie
i was ever told.

1443
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:42,641
"It's not that simple."

1444
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:47,112
And it's a lie they tell
you over and over again.

1445
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:50,816
What's not simple?

1446
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:52,384
Any of it.

1447
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,720
All of it.

1448
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:58,123
It's how they get you
to give up.

1449
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:01,126
They say,
"it's not that simple, vinny."

1450
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:05,831
So what's the truth?

1451
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:10,469
That it is.

1452
01:50:12,772 --> 01:50:17,009
That if you just do the thing that they
tell you you can't, then it's done.

1453
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:20,679
And you realize
it is that simple.

1454
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:23,716
And that it always was.

1455
01:51:21,676 --> 01:51:25,511
I feel like I should be
on a box of wheaties tomorrow,

1456
01:51:25,513 --> 01:51:27,279
doing gatorade commercials,

1457
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:28,814
going to Disneyland.

1458
01:51:28,816 --> 01:51:30,382
I'm just so happy.

1459
01:51:30,384 --> 01:51:34,053
There's no one in the history
of sports, to my knowledge,

1460
01:51:34,055 --> 01:51:36,155
has ever come back
from this type of injury.

1461
01:51:36,157 --> 01:51:38,857
I didn't want him to box.
I wanted him to be a...

1462
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,192
Anything but boxing.

1463
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,694
He's a fighter.

1464
01:51:41,696 --> 01:51:44,897
And fighter...
You don't make fighters.

1465
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:47,366
Vinny's a born fighter.

1466
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:49,268
<i>Lou duva is looking
at a suspension.</i>

1467
01:51:51,237 --> 01:51:53,138
<i>That's not professional.</i>

1468
01:51:59,245 --> 01:52:03,182
And Dr. cotter had a tear in his eye.
I could tell he felt for me.

1469
01:52:03,184 --> 01:52:07,219
Then he said, "son, I'm sorry to
say, you're not gonna box again."

1470
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:11,690
And I looked at him, and I said, "no, Dr.
Cotter. You're wrong."

1471
01:52:11,692 --> 01:52:13,926
I am gonna box again.

1472
01:52:13,928 --> 01:52:16,595
"See, you don't understand
what kind of man I am."

1473
01:52:32,545 --> 01:52:36,682
This halo portion goes around
the person's head...

1474
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,151
And is placed...

1475
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,153
Much like this.

1476
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:48,594
It's held in place by these rather...
Medieval devices

1477
01:52:48,596 --> 01:52:49,695
called screws.

1478
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:00,105
This fight was for the people of Rhode
Island and believers that believed in me.

1479
01:53:00,107 --> 01:53:02,975
I think you all came out. For the
believers, i wanna thank you.

1480
01:53:02,977 --> 01:53:05,611
I proved something to you. I
wanted to make you people proud.

1481
01:53:05,613 --> 01:53:08,147
And for the nonbelievers,
i just wanted to tell you,

1482
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:11,383
it's time to realize that the pazmanian
devil is no fictitious character.
