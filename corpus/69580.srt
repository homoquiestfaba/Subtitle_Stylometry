00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,588
Time to trade in
that oId Ferrari for a brand new...

5
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:50,425
ModNet's gonna bump my annuaI by ten Gs,
pIus throw in 5,000 shares of stock.

6
00:00:50,996 --> 00:00:52,861
What does ModNet make again?

7
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,957
Nothing. They're an ISP.
CoupIe of weeks from their IPO.

8
00:00:56,034 --> 00:01:00,403
I'm teIIin' ya, this is the crest of
the goId rush, my man. It ain't gonna Iast.

9
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:04,533
I heard about some guy - came up with
food dot somethin' - he's a miIIionaire.

10
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,740
- Food? He makes food?
- No, he patented it. The name.

11
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:12,215
Then he soId it to a company
that buys names. He's set for Iife.

12
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:15,776
We're aII a dotcom away
from earIy retirement.

13
00:01:15,854 --> 00:01:18,254
Is this the Iife, or what?

14
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,926
You know, my dad used to Iove
making things with his hands.

15
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:26,726
- He was a metaIworker at GeneraI Dynamics.
- Right.

16
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:30,393
One morning, there's a picture
on the front page of the LA Times -

17
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:32,630
astronauts inside the space shuttIe.

18
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:37,869
And my dad is beaming because behind them
you can see this paneI that he made.

19
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:41,071
I mean, he heId this paneI in his hands.

20
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:45,515
And he said to me that he feIt connected
with something bigger than himseIf.

21
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:50,021
And that's what I came to the VaIIey to do.
And I haven't done it.

22
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:53,756
You can't hoId a dotcom in your hands.

23
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,726
Are you having
some sort of mid-Iife crisis thing?

24
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,786
I'm onIy 23.

25
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,865
Go ahead and dream.

26
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:07,894
FaIcon Fire. Making the improbabIe possibIe.

27
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,203
Chicken suits. You're a genius, Andy.

28
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,005
I don't know what FaIcon Fire is.
I aIready want four of 'em.

29
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:15,376
Hey, Andy, which cock do you want?

30
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:18,280
- What?
- For the bus ads.

31
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,148
- BIowfish! Yum.
- Uh, the bIack one.

32
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,880
Hey, Andy...

33
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,054
Your ten has been pushed back to 12.

34
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:28,718
Your four and three are at ten
to prep you for your two.

35
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:32,286
It Ieaves your ten and two free for your five,
which needs to be rescheduIed.

36
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,889
Your 11 and 12 are coming at ten
to prep you for your two,

37
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,900
and your two has been canceIed.

38
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:43,336
Look at those geeks. You'd think
they'd shower before a big meeting.

39
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:46,403
Look at that ugIy IittIe contraption.

40
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:50,403
Whatever it is, they think
it's beautifuI. And they made it.

41
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,480
What's wrong, Andy?

42
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:58,714
This morning... I feeI so disconnected.

43
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:00,920
I'II make up for it tonight.

44
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,591
Go on. Ben's expecting you.

45
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:06,556
Other way, Iover-boy. It's Tuesday.

46
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:10,032
Ben's in the parking Iot
getting his teeth cIeaned.

47
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,005
He feIt connected to something
bigger than himseIf.

48
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:19,908
And that's what I came to the VaIIey to do.
And I haven't done it.

49
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:22,546
- Hey, Andy. Ow!
- Hey.

50
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:25,378
Hey, Boy Wonder! What can I do you for?

51
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,212
- I quit.
- What?

52
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:30,277
No more chicken suits, Ben.
I wanna work at La Honda.

53
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:32,619
La Honda? Are you nuts?

54
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:37,060
I know it's the worId's most prestigious
research Iab, but that's why I wanna do it.

55
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,121
To work with the top minds.
To be an iron man.

56
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:43,093
I wanna... I wanna make something.

57
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,466
Something meaningfuI
that touches everyone's Iives.

58
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:53,739
Some thing that wiII sit on every desk
in every city in every country in the worId.

59
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,245
- I want...
- The joIt.

60
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:58,305
You can get me in. PIease, Ben.

61
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,114
You know I can do this.

62
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:16,760
Shit!

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,130
Shit!

64
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,098
C'mon!

65
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,348
Huh? I can't be Iate, buddy!

66
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,691
- Hank?
- Now what?

67
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:25,395
You snuck another name on my Titan team.
The team is aIready fuII.

68
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,001
I handpicked that team.
There's no room for this new Caspar.

69
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,010
Andy Caspar comes highIy recommended
from Omega Logic.

70
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,374
LIoyd's continued generosity
funds La Honda.

71
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:40,573
Boy Wonder's...
Boy Wonder's supposed to be briIIiant.

72
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:43,644
Came up with those funny ads
for your FaIcon Fire chip.

73
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,622
Chicken suits?

74
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,922
I wanted to sIit my wrists when I saw that.

75
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:55,092
Everything I invent is dumbed down
by some marketing puke named Andy.

76
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,103
- You're 20 minutes Iate, Mr Caspar.
- I'm sorry.

77
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,369
I...

78
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:08,836
I got sidetracked.

79
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:11,610
This pIace is amazing. It's Iike, uh...

80
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:16,814
Christmas morning and DisneyIand and sex,
aII wrapped up in one.

81
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,753
This is Francis Benoit, our chief engineer.

82
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:28,663
I wanted you two to meet before we made
our finaI decision about who's on Team Titan.

83
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,401
Francis, I'm so amped to be here.
I wanna do what you do.

84
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,237
I want a chance to work on something
bigger than myseIf. I want the joIt.

85
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:42,178
Why do you think you shouId be part
of the Titan? You're just a marketing puke.

86
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:45,341
With a degree in eIectricaI
engineering from Stanford.

87
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,681
- I guess that makes me different.
- How?

88
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,653
- I might approach a probIem differentIy.
- How?

89
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,527
- I might see simpIer soIutions.
- SimpIe soIutions Iike chicken suits?

90
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:03,929
Is Francis Benoit reaIIy an asshoIe,
or does he just pretend to be?

91
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:07,335
FYI, newb, Francis is just everywhere.

92
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,105
Notjust here, but in the VaIIey.

93
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:13,303
If you get on his bad side, he'II crush you.

94
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,441
- So he's an asshoIe?
- Pretty much.

95
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,817
To the Iast hurrah!

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,686
I can't teII you how jazzed I am.
I don't care about the pay cut.

97
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:32,787
Do you know how Iong
we can Iive off Top Ramen?

98
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:35,765
Ten cockroaches can Iive a year
off a singIe postage stamp.

99
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,827
ExactIy. We'II be Iike the cockroaches -
totaIIy unencumbered.

100
00:07:40,138 --> 00:07:42,368
I don't need that big apartment.

101
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:46,700
Andy, I think you missed the point
of my IittIe cockroach factoid.

102
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:50,179
I don't want any part
of your poverty experiment.

103
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:56,386
So... you don't want anything to do with me
without my huge saIary?

104
00:07:56,454 --> 00:08:01,391
WouId you have anything to do with me
without... the saIine twins?

105
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:10,299
Just drop my diaphragm in the maiI.

106
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:16,205
The twins are awesome.

107
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:40,328
No Ioud noises.
Bathroom's at the end of the haIIway.

108
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,764
No hanky-panky in the shower.

109
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,963
Hi, how are you doing?

110
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:48,597
We have a few rejects from
the Stanford marching band.

111
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:52,370
MostIy tubas, but I've had everything.

112
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,847
Trombones, piccoIos, ukuIeIes,
you name it, over the years.

113
00:08:56,915 --> 00:09:01,079
I Iived with a fIautist once.
Boy, couId he triII!

114
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:08,486
Oh, come on, boys.
PIease keep it tidy for me, wiII ya?

115
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:13,187
Pretty fabuIous, huh?

116
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:19,832
- So what's through the sIiding doors?
- Your neighbor. Leave those shut.

117
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:22,498
No hanky-panky.

118
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:42,190
- I'm sorry, I didn't, um...
- Knock?

119
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,228
Is... this the women's?

120
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:47,423
It's a boy/girI's party, but we stiII knock.

121
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:52,594
You're gonna have to do it
the oId-fashioned way.

122
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,106
- Do what?
- Whatever. There are no outIets.

123
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:06,213
- I'm Andy. I just moved into three.
- ReaIIy? I think we connect.

124
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:10,284
I'm feeIing a IittIe something here too.

125
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,755
I meant our rooms connect.

126
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,953
I'm in two. No peeking.

127
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:27,504
Team Titan, WiIIy. I'm an iron man!

128
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:32,635
Congrats. Hey, I got my ModNet stock
options today. I'm a paper miIIionaire!

129
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,270
- Who says it's sIowin' down?
- CooI. Drinks are on you.

130
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:38,144
- I'II meet you at Mr Kim's in an hour.
- Not tonight, man.

131
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:41,208
I'm having dinner...
with your ex-assistant, actuaIIy.

132
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:44,483
Robin?! My girIfriend Robin?!

133
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:49,392
Yeah. Uh... she toId me
about the breakup. Sorry.

134
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:53,220
God, she is so insaneIy hot, man!

135
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:57,732
HeIIo?

136
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:02,603
I oughta maiI it through your IittIe skuII,
you Ieeching dragon-woman...

137
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:04,801
WiIIy's my best friend!

138
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,210
JeaIous? No, I'm not... jeaIous!

139
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,716
In fact, I am having sex right now too.
Yes, I am! You hear this?

140
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,717
SqueaI Iike a tuba for Daddy!

141
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,756
So... taIking to your mom?

142
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:30,262
Ex-girIfriend screwing former best friend.

143
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:35,002
- Uh, weII, what are you Iistening to?
- SiIence.

144
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:38,531
Safety earmuffs. 97% noise reduction.

145
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,543
- I Iike quiet to work.
- So you're a scuIptor?

146
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:45,711
Yeah.

147
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:50,617
I'm a grad student at Stanford.
My dad wanted me to study digitaI art,

148
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:54,624
but then I'd be in serious danger
of having a marketabIe skiII.

149
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:56,751
You're funny.

150
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,728
And pretty.

151
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:01,292
Brains and boobs. KiIIer combo.

152
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:07,998
- What do you do?
- WeII, I work at La Honda.

153
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:12,873
Ooh. La Honda. EI Car SaIesman.

154
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:16,571
No, no. La Honda.

155
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,679
- The worId-famous research center.
- Never heard of it.

156
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,814
Hey, newb. Francis is havin'
a Titan team party.

157
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,990
- You can't bring your DS.
- DS?

158
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,724
Docking Station?

159
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,225
Oh, my God.

160
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,911
Marketing puke!

161
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:01,621
Hey, Caspar.

162
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,923
Hey, I'm gIad you're here. Come on in.

163
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:07,624
- Oh, I didn't actuaIIy bring a bathing suit.
- That's OK. Nobody did.

164
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,395
- There's room next to Griff.
- Come on.

165
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,703
- I'm...
- You're not staying on the Titan.

166
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,137
What?

167
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:23,909
- But Hank put me on the Titan.
- Because you worked for LIoyd at Omega?

168
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,644
I don't care.
There's no vanity spots on the Titan.

169
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:30,378
- Move down!
- Move down!

170
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,931
Don't worry. I've got another project for you.

171
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,799
VoIunteer for this one and I'II make sure
you work on something, down the road,

172
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,600
that gives you the joIt you're Iookin' for. OK?

173
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:50,504
It's time.

174
00:13:55,546 --> 00:13:58,777
What's this other project?

175
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:03,579
A Iaptop computer that retaiIs for $99.

176
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:07,848
Is that ajoke?

177
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,292
The worId needs a cheap,
portabIe computer, Caspar.

178
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,661
Third WorId schooIchiIdren
wannajoin the information age.

179
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,430
I thought Third WorId
schooIchiIdren wanted... food.

180
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:26,443
Do this for me and I promise
you'II be part of my next big project.

181
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,981
Titan! Titan! Titan!

182
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,987
It's up to you, Caspar.

183
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:42,925
You can fiII paiIs... or you can Iight fires.

184
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:46,922
Now... Iift your arms.

185
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:04,778
- You're quitting the Titan to do what?!
- The PC-99.

186
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,909
Are you nuts? Did Francis threaten you?

187
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:11,853
No, no. It seems chaIIenging.
Who do I report to? Who's my team Ieader?

188
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:16,223
WeII, you're the onIy one on the project.
I guess that makes you team Ieader.

189
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:18,353
The onIy one?

190
00:15:18,996 --> 00:15:23,194
But this is an important project, right?
Cheap computers, Third WorId kids.

191
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,633
Anything stopping me
from recruiting a team?

192
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:28,228
No, but there are onIy
a coupIe of unassigneds Ieft.

193
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:32,936
If you can get them to voIunteer for your
project, go ahead, knock yourseIf out.

194
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:44,283
I'm Iookin' for SaIman Fard. SaIman?

195
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:46,414
- Hi. Andy Caspar.
- Yes.

196
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:49,689
Christ! What have you got, a T1?

197
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,595
It cranks. I've got a brown box that sniffs
out the miIitary's secret fiberoptic pipe.

198
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:58,726
CIA's got a cIassified fiIe on me.
You want to see?

199
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:04,901
My girIfriend says
don't mess with the CIA, IRS or bikers.

200
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,841
I'm onIy afraid of bikers.

201
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,971
''Domestic and internationaI
eIectronic trespassing:

202
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,915
NASA, Microsoft, the KuaIa Lumpur
Department of Transportation...''

203
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:16,920
- You're a hi-tech bad-ass.
- I provide a service.

204
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:20,617
AII the systems I've hacked are more
secure today because of my efforts.

205
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,852
My girIfriend caIIs me Robin Hood.

206
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:26,021
It's a doubIe entendre. I'm uncircumcised!

207
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:30,395
WeII, um... thanks for that image.

208
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,993
So... I'm putting together a team,

209
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,632
and maybe you couId heIp me track down
some of these other names on the Iist.

210
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,144
Curtis Reese is a wizard. TG: Top Gun.

211
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:44,306
This guy thinks in binary and he craps C++.

212
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:47,943
Trust me. He couId design the Titan aIone
if Francis gave him a shot.

213
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:51,183
So why is he unassigned?

214
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,519
Shit.

215
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:09,135
- OK, so he Iacks certain sociaI skiIIs...
- Like the power of speech?

216
00:17:09,206 --> 00:17:12,141
I'm teIIing you, Andy, this guy's got the stuff.

217
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,701
Besides, if we don't take him,
they'II put him to sIeep.

218
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,408
I'II handIe this. You go check out the Iab.

219
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,681
Andy? You in here?

220
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:59,314
Yeah. Over here.

221
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:04,724
Hey.

222
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:07,161
Andy Caspar. WeIcome, Curtis.

223
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,435
- Tiny.
- What's goin' on, Tiny?

224
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,466
Entropy is winning.

225
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:20,735
OK...

226
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,439
Oh. You Iike that desk? It's aII yours.

227
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:26,642
Andy? I want the desk next to the firepIace.

228
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:31,120
There's one more name on this Iist,
and that is... DarreII CIaxton?

229
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:37,421
This guy is a totaI hard-wired
moby motherboard jockey.

230
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:38,484
Is that good?

231
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:43,625
He took an AthIon 750 and overcIocked it to
2GHz, and it's running constant at 38 degrees.

232
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:50,199
- Which is good.
- Great! WeII, where do we find him?

233
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:15,159
Don't buy into the rumors.
I've never had a run-in with him.

234
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:18,565
- What's that he's pIaying?
- It's his anger stick.

235
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:23,232
It's a homemade stringIess guitar.
Lasers teII it where his fingers are.

236
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,335
- It Iooks Iike a weapon.
- Don't go there.

237
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,169
DarreII.

238
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,078
DarreII?

239
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,707
DarreII!

240
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:37,516
Don't yeII in DarreII's ear.

241
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,718
Hi, DarreII, I'm An...

242
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,361
I'm Andy.

243
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,894
One drop of this on DarreII's paIm

244
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,400
and you'II be pushin' the mercury past 105

245
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:58,704
and chokin' to death
on your own mucous in 24 hours.

246
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:02,876
But you'd be dead too.

247
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:06,142
DarreII's been inocuIated.

248
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:09,384
Right.

249
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:13,215
So I guess a hug's out of the question?

250
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:17,450
DarreII, I hear you're good with your hands.

251
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:21,089
- Are you coming on to DarreII?
- Andy's putting together a team.

252
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,497
Is that drump on your team?

253
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:32,637
Good. You aII know each other.
How about I buy you guys Iunch?

254
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:37,945
Fine. But no project-speak before chow.

255
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,921
Nice ride!

256
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:46,957
Shotgun!

257
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,825
DarreII actuaIIy owns a shotgun.

258
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:53,688
You take it.

259
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:03,301
- What's wrong with him?
- Hey, it's gonna be OK.

260
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:06,639
Drumpy can't function in the big room.

261
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:11,546
- Where are his shoes?
- He doesn't have any.

262
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:26,530
Now what's wrong?

263
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:28,622
How do you think peopIe get sick?

264
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:31,964
Some guy picks his nose,
scratches his ass and grabs that handIe.

265
00:21:32,036 --> 00:21:36,200
You touch it, next thing you know you're
bIeedin' outta your eyes, outta your anus.

266
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:38,673
Go ahead. Be my guest. Touch it.

267
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:00,289
Live dangerousIy.

268
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,930
Speak, Caspar. What's your project?

269
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:45,108
OK. You guys ready to change the worId?

270
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:49,703
We are gonna buiId... the $99 portabIe.

271
00:22:50,147 --> 00:22:52,707
The cheapie box?!

272
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:56,116
The cheapie box is La Honda's viIIage idiot.

273
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:59,212
That project comes up every year.
Nobody voIunteers for it.

274
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,485
It's a topmost WOMBAT.

275
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:03,617
Waste Of Money, Brains And Time.

276
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:05,992
DarreII came to La Honda
to burn to the big iron,

277
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:09,760
not work on some Costco
speak 'n' speII science project.

278
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:16,670
WeII... DarreII must feeI a tad frustrated
because DarreII didn't make the big iron team.

279
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:21,276
DarreII is just another broken toy
with no project to caII his own.

280
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:25,747
Who are you caIIing broken?

281
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:36,589
Look, I think you're aII terrific,
and I can see you're just marking time here

282
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,687
untiI you get your big breaks as...
Armani modeIs.

283
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:44,264
But untiI then, I'm the onIy game in town.

284
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:47,327
DarreII couId be an Armani modeI.

285
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:51,773
Whatever. Let me just pay
and we'II get outta here.

286
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,670
Pay? That's so cute. Pay...

287
00:24:10,194 --> 00:24:12,321
Son of a...

288
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:20,827
DarreII gets his best ideas
between 101 and 103 miIes per.

289
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:30,877
Sorry, Caspar.
Not interested in your cheapie-box project.

290
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:33,075
DarreII's strictIy big nums or no nums.

291
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,484
Why didn't DarreII teII me that
before I Iet DarreII drive my car?

292
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:39,749
DarreII wanted to drive your car.

293
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,190
Screw it!

294
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,924
It's a stupid bitty-box project anyway. The
parts aIone are gonna cost more than $99.

295
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,159
It's impossibIe.

296
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:55,128
WeII... OK, Andy. I'm in.

297
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,969
- No, I said it was impossibIe.
- Yes, I know.

298
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,977
Anybody can do something that can be done.

299
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:05,175
My first project.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

300
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,288
WeII, weII, Iadies...

301
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:23,689
Let's give the PC-99 iron men
the oId Titan saIute!

302
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:30,532
Bunch of Iosers!

303
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:58,262
Aqua tofana is
a transparent tasteIess poison

304
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:01,793
that deIivers death with no reaI symptoms.

305
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:05,772
I'm in.

306
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:11,371
He's never officiaIIy been Iinked to any
murders, but I'd stick to bottIed water.

307
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:14,645
Oh, one more thing.
I get to drive your Porsche.

308
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:35,661
OK, we're the Iaughing stock of La Honda.
The cheapie-box pussies.

309
00:26:36,373 --> 00:26:38,398
But we're gonna prove 'em wrong.

310
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:42,468
You're iron men.
You're the brightest. You're the best.

311
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,178
And you are...?

312
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:51,183
I'm Kriss KringIe.
I'm gonna make the magic happen.

313
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:52,779
Come on, guys.

314
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,655
Let's buiId a $99 computer.

315
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:01,223
And nothing's gonna stop us.

316
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,624
Who took the dry markers?

317
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,635
I Iove you, Tiny.

318
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:09,171
I Iove you.

319
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:23,314
$1390? Shit, this is impossibIe.

320
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:27,915
- Can't we get rid of some of this stuff?
- Why the PC-99? Why not the PC-300?

321
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:32,155
Because it's the goddamn PC-99,
not the PC-300.

322
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:35,221
WeII, caII it the goddamn PC-1390
and we're done.

323
00:27:36,033 --> 00:27:38,763
- SaIman, any ideas?
- The name sucks.

324
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,500
OK, fine. WeII, Iet's start
by thinkin' up a new name.

325
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,406
That's marketing.
If I had wanted to be in marketing,

326
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:48,069
I wouId have had 'em remove my forebrain.

327
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:52,138
TeII you what. You naiI the new name
and I'II take you out for a night on the town.

328
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:53,877
Dinner, dancing, the works.

329
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:57,910
You're an attractive feIIow, Andy,
but... I'd rather bring my girIfriend.

330
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:01,253
- You don't have a girIfriend!
- Yes, I do.

331
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,885
She's very sexy. Oysters make her horny.

332
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:08,125
You've never had a girI that didn't
cost $3.99 for the first five minutes.

333
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:10,359
- Your mother uses Macintosh.
- What?

334
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,925
You heard me. System 7.

335
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:17,303
AII right, Fard, that's it.
You're dead. You're goin' down.

336
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,373
Sodium oIefin suIfonate.

337
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:28,741
Boom.

338
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:30,684
Go team.

339
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:45,501
- New scuIpture?
- No, same one.

340
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:50,338
So what's it gonna be?

341
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,272
I don't know yet.

342
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:54,902
WeII, how wiII you know when you're done?

343
00:28:54,978 --> 00:29:00,075
NewsfIash. Sometimes it's OK not to know
what you're doing whiIe you're doing it.

344
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,722
Kinda Iooks Iike a turd.

345
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:08,383
That's what I was thinking.

346
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:13,488
- How come I don't know your name?
- You never asked.

347
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:17,763
It's AIisa.

348
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:21,533
I'm Andy. It's nice to meet you.

349
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:24,503
Again.

350
00:29:24,975 --> 00:29:27,068
Wanna have dinner?

351
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:32,309
There's a supper cIub up on Russian HiII
that makes the best Iobster cervice.

352
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:36,182
How about Top Ramen
in my room, say, sevenish?

353
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:38,480
Done.

354
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,688
Nice compromise.

355
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:53,132
Add the water, then nuke for five minutes.
I'II make the saIad.

356
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,607
Jeez!

357
00:30:07,684 --> 00:30:10,084
What, fIavor enhancers?

358
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,417
They're cIean. It's just how I dry them.

359
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:28,397
Damn.

360
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:33,731
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

361
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:40,010
I'm Iooking around your room and
I am struck by a Iack of... anything.

362
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:44,120
I just got rid of everything except what I need.

363
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:47,384
Left me room to concentrate
on stuff that matters.

364
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:53,453
That's my phiIosophy:
simpIify, cIarify, economize.

365
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:04,130
So how's Iife at... Le Fonda?

366
00:31:07,043 --> 00:31:08,874
WeII...

367
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,446
It's not what I expected.

368
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:17,317
I thought I'd be working on a cutting-edge
project with the greatest brains on the pIanet,

369
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:21,084
but I've been teamed up with these bunch of...

370
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,493
I don't know. This may be a huge mistake.

371
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,895
WeII, I think you're very brave.

372
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:31,092
ReaIIy?

373
00:31:31,168 --> 00:31:33,159
Do go on.

374
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:37,104
WeII, you gave up a Iot
to pursue an inteIIectuaI ideaI.

375
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:39,836
I don't know a Iot of peopIe
who wouId have done that.

376
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,401
So big-ups to you.

377
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:45,038
- ReaIIy? Big-ups?
- Big-ups.

378
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:49,245
WeII, I've never gotten big-ups.
AII right! Big-ups.

379
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:57,683
So...

380
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:04,290
Is this the part of the movie where
we break the sexuaI tension... with a kiss?

381
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:09,665
No.

382
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:15,308
This is where I say ''WeIcome to the house.
It's time for you to go.''

383
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:19,373
No, that's a different movie.

384
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:22,617
Let's just keep it simpIe for now.

385
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,019
For now.

386
00:32:32,629 --> 00:32:34,961
How's it goin', Caspar?

387
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:42,430
Uh... good.

388
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:48,502
I'd say we're, Iike, a nine-iron from the
dance fIoor, then a two-putt to the cup.

389
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:51,172
Of course, you can't rush genius.

390
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:56,281
Yeah, that's true. Except here, of course.
You've got about three weeks to deIiver.

391
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:58,378
Three weeks?!

392
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:03,651
- But nobody said anything about a deadIine.
- We aII have deadIines, Caspar.

393
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:11,158
Guys, we just have three weeks to...

394
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:14,692
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

395
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:17,467
- Ride me, cowboy, ride me!
- HoIy shit.

396
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,533
Whoa. Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

397
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,202
She's briIIiant!

398
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,442
Isn't that Janie HickenIocker
from the robotics Iab?

399
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:29,952
What is this, a circIe jerk?
What are you pIaying with now?

400
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,353
Strontium barium niobic crystaI dispIay unit.

401
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:40,423
- HoIogram.
- It's a Desert Storm Ieftover... reprogrammed.

402
00:33:40,497 --> 00:33:42,727
It is. It's Janie HickenIocker.

403
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,267
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

404
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,803
How'd you...? Tiny...

405
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:54,042
OK, back on earth...
have we made any progress?

406
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,806
Dammit, we've onIy got three weeks to finish.

407
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,647
- You couId Iose the coIor ink cartridge.
- It wouId save $35.

408
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:06,385
That's it? That's the big idea?

409
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:12,890
Guys, we need to get outside the Iines.
Think IateraIIy, outside the box.

410
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:16,622
Box.

411
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:40,752
What are you doin'?

412
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:43,088
Take your foot off my foot!

413
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,465
- You guys see the VW next to us?
- Yes!

414
00:34:50,533 --> 00:34:53,058
We're traveIing on the same road
at the same speed,

415
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,900
but it cost a fraction of
the price that this does. Why?

416
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:59,999
Because it's a piece-of-shit Iow-end
cheapie machine! Get your foot off!

417
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:09,680
No, Iook again. It's simpIe. It has no extras.
It's onIy got what it needs.

418
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:13,689
We need to simpIify, cIarify, economize.

419
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:30,369
SimpIify, cIarify, economize.

420
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:33,999
Are you guys payin' attention?

421
00:35:34,077 --> 00:35:36,545
That had ''suicide'' written aII over it.

422
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:39,274
No, I get it.

423
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:45,152
Get rid of everything. The PC-99
onIy exists in cyberspace. In heaven.

424
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,246
- You kidding?
- No, I'm serious.

425
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:52,590
I'm upset and I think I wet myseIf,
but I'm serious. Put it aII on the Internet!

426
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:57,791
No CD, no fIoppy, no RAM,
no hard drive, no nothing.

427
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:00,131
The software's aII stored in cyberspace.

428
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:03,536
- You're a paIm piIot, Fard.
- Shut up, zipper head!

429
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,268
- Maggot fox.
- Look, Iet's go farther.

430
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:09,971
Let's get rid of the printer.
For 99 bucks, they don't get a printer.

431
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:13,709
Let's go even farther.
For 99 bucks, Iet's get rid of the TV monitor.

432
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:19,187
- They get a keyboard and a tube of KY JeIIy.
- Jesus Christ, DarreII, shut the heII up.

433
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:24,092
I'm sick of you shitting on us when
you haven't come up with a thing yourseIf.

434
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,424
You know what I think?
I think you have ideas,

435
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,727
but you won't teII us cos you're
too afraid of what we might say.

436
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:34,532
We don't have time for that, DarreII,
so from now on you put up or you shut up.

437
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:36,697
Is that cIear?

438
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:41,267
What's up?

439
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,077
VirtuaI reaIity gIoves. Been around
since the eighties. Never caught on.

440
00:36:46,149 --> 00:36:51,678
TotaI bargain item.
They repIace the keyboard and the mouse.

441
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:56,118
Yak-yak-yak. These are mine.

442
00:36:57,193 --> 00:37:01,254
Big bang, Caspar. Two features, one item.

443
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,726
CooI. ShaII we try 'em?

444
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:09,603
Niet, niet, bIah bIah!

445
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,659
- AntibacteriaI geI.
- It's Iike wearing an oId condom.

446
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,026
You get used to it.

447
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:44,300
The geI.

448
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:46,365
OK, give it a whirI.

449
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:50,540
CD ROM. MaiIbox. Documents.

450
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:54,479
TooIs. Printer. FiIes.

451
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:00,718
AII right!

452
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,987
We're just a few hundred bucks
away from our goaI.

453
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:07,529
It's time to make the magic happen.

454
00:38:23,446 --> 00:38:26,040
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

455
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,917
Ride me!

456
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,725
You've got maiI!

457
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:47,599
Where's Tiny? Tiny! Tiny!

458
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,299
- What did I do?
- The hoIogram. Turn it on. Turn it on.

459
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,934
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

460
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,741
- BeautifuI.
- You want 15 minutes aIone with her?

461
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:01,272
SimpIify. Like you said, DarreII,
we get rid of the monitor.

462
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:05,082
- DarreII was just messin' with ya.
- No. No, no, no.

463
00:39:05,154 --> 00:39:07,554
We make it... a hoIogram.

464
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:09,489
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

465
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:14,657
AII right, aII right. Imagine... an empty desk.

466
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:22,165
And aII that's on it... is this.

467
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:25,200
In front of you is a virtuaI desktop

468
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:31,771
where 3-D icons hover in space
Iike, uh, a shimmering star fieId.

469
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:35,614
Maybe there's a IittIe
animated paperboy on a bicycIe

470
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:39,519
grabbing emaiIs out of a pouch
and tossing them up onto my desktop.

471
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:42,990
- Yeah. Doesn't suck.
- You're good.

472
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,892
I see why you were in marketing.

473
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:47,953
Can it be done?

474
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:50,428
No way.

475
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:54,768
Fine. WeII, I guess it's impossibIe.

476
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:59,705
Yeah. It's impossibIe.

477
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:02,308
We know what you're doing, Caspar.

478
00:40:02,378 --> 00:40:08,374
AII I'm saying is no three minds, no matter
how staggering their genius, couId do this.

479
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:17,192
OK, dammit, bring it over here.
Let's see this thing.

480
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,353
OK, Tiny, how does this work?

481
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:41,941
- The economy's in the crapper, Hank.
- What a surprise, LIoyd...

482
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:44,783
I wanna review this year's projects.

483
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:52,121
Now what is this horseshit
about deveIoping a $99 computer?

484
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:55,130
A group of unassigned Iosers
voIunteered for it.

485
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:59,396
Are we on the same page, Hank? Maybe
Omega shouId give away computers for free?

486
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,903
Why are you worried about this?

487
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,970
Where the heII do you think
my profit comes from?

488
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:09,375
It's the hardware, stupid.
I did a biIIion doIIars Iast year.

489
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:12,710
How am I gonna make a profit
on a $99 kids' toy?

490
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:16,813
Why haven't you sent
the annuaI sponsorship fund yet?

491
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:19,719
I wanted to deIiver the funds in person.

492
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:31,767
But LIoyd, this is just
a fraction of the annuaI funds.

493
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,428
1/52nd, to be exact.

494
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,938
Market's on the skids, I'm cutting back.

495
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:40,999
From now on you'II get your money
a week at a time.

496
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:43,904
That way I can keep you on a short Ieash.

497
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:51,382
Oh, Hank? I suggest you keep the PC-99
on an even shorter Ieash.

498
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:21,779
OK. Road test.

499
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:25,719
Big moment: 2-D to 3-D.

500
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,880
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

501
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,324
AII right. Here we go.

502
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:34,790
Three, two, one...

503
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:42,469
- What happened?
- Wait. Let's check this part.

504
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:45,598
OK. Connection?

505
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:03,355
Whoa. Amazing.

506
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:07,453
- I saw 3-D icons.
- Yes, but that's aII there is, Andy.

507
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,933
The rest of the brain exists in cyberspace.
We need a way to Iink it to the hoIogram.

508
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:16,700
We'd make a source at boot-up,
piece the server, generate an override,

509
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:21,641
then modeI bIush once,
hoIographic context instantaneousIy...

510
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:23,975
- A hypnotizer code.
- Yes.

511
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:25,946
EIegance.

512
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:27,505
TransIation?

513
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:31,178
SimpIe. Tiny wiII write a code
to connect aII the eIements together:

514
00:43:31,254 --> 00:43:33,688
the Internet, the gIoves and the hoIogram.

515
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:37,123
- CIear?
- CrystaI. Get writing, Tiny.

516
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,289
Do you smeII that?

517
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,730
That... is the stench of victory.

518
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:51,796
I can't... I can't...

519
00:43:51,874 --> 00:43:54,035
Where the heII is LIoyd? CaII him again!

520
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,479
- I'm right here, Hank.
- Jesus! I hate when you do that.

521
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:02,543
I don't think you understand my situation.

522
00:44:02,618 --> 00:44:06,577
I've got 500 engineers...
and if they find out we're out of PringIes,

523
00:44:06,656 --> 00:44:10,558
we're gonna have a riot on our hands.
Where's this week's check?

524
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:14,494
- Did you take care of the probIem?
- In a coupIe of weeks it won't be an issue.

525
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:18,227
Fine. In a coupIe of weeks
I'II send you your next check.

526
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,232
- Whoa.
- Now what's wrong?

527
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:27,208
- Janie HickenIocker.
- HeIIo, boys.

528
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:30,703
- Whoa.
- Ride me, cowboy!

529
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,081
- Come on, guys. We're on a deadIine.
- Let's get to it.

530
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:37,218
We're aImost there.
Tiny, you the man.

531
00:44:37,286 --> 00:44:41,689
So just write Iike your ass is on fire
and that code is a barreI of water.

532
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:52,667
They're Iike cockroaches. They're
unstoppabIe. I'm just gonna fire them.

533
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:56,466
You can't. You'II have a mass revoIt.

534
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,837
LIoyd's got me by the baIIs.

535
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:03,368
If I don't get aII the money now, I...
I can't make payroII.

536
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:06,506
Why don't you just give them the project?

537
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:10,748
- What do you mean?
- Let them Ieave La Honda with the project.

538
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,722
They'II die out there. You know how many
start-ups go castors-up every week?

539
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,954
And what if they hit pay dirt?
Invent the next PaIm or iMac?

540
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:25,357
If it'II make you feeI better, have them sign
a nonexcIusive waiver, just in case.

541
00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:29,566
Put it together and what do you got?

542
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:33,097
I come off Iike
a generous patron of technoIogy.

543
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,469
LIoyd gives us our money.

544
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:42,875
There's no more money for your project.
The PC-99 is dead at La Honda.

545
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,147
- What?
- What?

546
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:49,456
But we did it. Hank,
you're not gonna beIieve it,

547
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:54,963
but we buiIt a hoIographic computer
that actuaIIy costs $99. It's magic.

548
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:59,962
- What are you taIking about?
- AII right. Imagine the ad campaign.

549
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:03,062
A boy finds something in the desert,

550
00:46:03,139 --> 00:46:04,868
he rubs it, and boom!

551
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,909
An eIectronic genie,
a hoIogram, appears before him.

552
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:10,775
- Marketing buIIshit.
- No, it's not.

553
00:46:10,846 --> 00:46:13,007
Then show me.

554
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:16,885
- WeII, it's not...
- Uh-huh.

555
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,155
I gotta go, Hank.
The reaI men are fIash-testing the Titan.

556
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:34,025
- Hank, you've gotta beIieve me.
- Sorry. Francis is right.

557
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,833
You're out of money, you're out of time.
Your team wiII be spIit up and reassigned.

558
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:49,409
No. We'II do it on our own. We quit.

559
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:52,015
- What?
- Andy, wait a minute.

560
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:54,420
- We'II do it on our own. We quit.
- Andy...

561
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,860
Francis said you'd react this way,
so I had an exit document prepared.

562
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:03,188
- Wait a minute...
- ''NonexcIusive waiver

563
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:06,428
to inteIIectuaI property rights...''

564
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:11,337
NonexcIusive. So... you can
market our ideas too?

565
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:15,400
Yeah. You've got aII the rights,
but so does La Honda.

566
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:19,244
We're Ben and you're Jerry,
so we share the ice cream.

567
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:21,078
Capeesh?

568
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,947
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:47:23,018 --> 00:47:25,987
But onIy in what we've deveIoped so far.

570
00:47:26,055 --> 00:47:30,014
Anything we deveIop
after we Ieave, we own, right?

571
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:32,026
- That's right.
- Andy...

572
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:35,063
We shouId taIk about this. We're a team.

573
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:36,826
DarreII's in.

574
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:40,528
Don't you foIIow the news?
The economy is aII over the pIace.

575
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:43,197
We don't have time for that. He's in.

576
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:46,770
- Hey, Andy, wait a minute.
- Come on.

577
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:48,275
Where's Tiny?

578
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:57,018
- How you doin', Tiny?
- Not doing. Done.

579
00:47:57,086 --> 00:48:00,749
You did it? Way to go, Tiny!

580
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,781
- How many Iines of code?
- 69.

581
00:48:07,096 --> 00:48:09,758
- I toId you you're the man, Tiny.
- Hey!

582
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:13,290
Hey, get away from there.
Everything is the property of La Honda.

583
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,769
- You can take personaI items onIy.
- No, no...

584
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:17,567
Mine, mine.

585
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,132
- Mine!
- You can't do this. This is aII our work.

586
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,007
- Guys...
- You got eight minutes.

587
00:48:23,078 --> 00:48:25,569
- Let's taIk about this.
- Seven and a haIf now.

588
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:27,980
Shit! We have nothing!

589
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:33,085
- The hypnotizer?
- Didn't put it in yet.

590
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:42,430
OK. Screw Hank. We're not even
gonna teII him about the hypnotizer, OK?

591
00:48:42,498 --> 00:48:45,934
Tiny, grab your stuff. We're outta here.

592
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,662
What?

593
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:53,334
We're Ieaving La Honda.

594
00:48:55,377 --> 00:48:57,277
Leave? No.

595
00:48:57,346 --> 00:49:00,213
No, no, no. Stay, yes. Stay.

596
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,178
Come on. We quit.

597
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,781
Quit? Quit?

598
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:10,053
We're gonna do this on our own.
The four of us.

599
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:18,491
The five of us.

600
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:47,552
Hey, Caspar. I heard you're Ieaving.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

601
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,723
No hard feeIings?

602
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:51,663
I don't get you, Francis.

603
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:55,226
I rose to your chaIIenge.
HeII, I bitch-sIapped your chaIIenge.

604
00:49:55,304 --> 00:49:57,397
- And you go and screw me.
- Hey, if you hurry,

605
00:49:57,473 --> 00:50:01,500
you can get your marketing-puke job back
in time to work on the Titan campaign.

606
00:50:01,577 --> 00:50:06,480
But pIease, do me a favor.
No chicken suits this time, OK?

607
00:50:12,087 --> 00:50:14,555
Move over. I drive.

608
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:06,306
We were kicked out of Eden for this?!

609
00:51:07,142 --> 00:51:11,203
In Iess than 24 hours we've gone
from Ieading a technoIogicaI revoIution

610
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,305
to being unempIoyed vagrants.

611
00:51:14,016 --> 00:51:16,246
And there are tubas.

612
00:51:17,252 --> 00:51:20,244
CaIm down, SaIman. We're iron men.

613
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:22,882
PeopIe'II Iine up to see
what we got. Trust me.

614
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,826
Trust you? The goId rush is over.
PeopIe are getting fired.

615
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:31,525
How can I teII my girIfriend I chose
to join the unempIoyed? She'II castrate me.

616
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,458
Hey, Andy.

617
00:51:36,238 --> 00:51:40,038
Who's the honey?
Is she your docking station?

618
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:44,478
She's a friend, and that's a reaIIy rude term.

619
00:51:49,385 --> 00:51:52,149
Come on. It's time for pIan B.

620
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:55,190
PIan B? What was pIan A?

621
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:01,126
Look around you. I want you
to remember what you're wearing today.

622
00:52:01,196 --> 00:52:03,630
I want you to Iook at these faces.

623
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:07,829
You're gonna remember these faces
for the rest of your Iife.

624
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:13,307
Cos you're gonna teII the story of
this meeting for the rest of your Iife.

625
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:18,711
I'm about to bestow upon you
the hoIy graiI of the computer industry.

626
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:21,573
WeII, Iet me see.

627
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:27,384
Imagine you couId put these hands in
and touch the souI of your computer.

628
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:31,255
Touch your computer's heart.

629
00:52:35,564 --> 00:52:39,159
Do you wanna be part of the revoIution?

630
00:52:39,234 --> 00:52:43,034
I have no idea
what the heII you're taIkin' about.

631
00:52:45,808 --> 00:52:48,003
But I Iove your passion!

632
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:54,777
Here.

633
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:03,347
Oh, my.

634
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,253
HeIIo.

635
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:13,691
DarreII can't work in this environment.

636
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:16,169
Bacteria, moId, spores...

637
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:19,533
Rat fecaI matter.

638
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:22,907
Come on, it's romantic.
We're a garage start-up.

639
00:53:22,978 --> 00:53:26,311
- Think HewIett-Packard.
- Think Hunter virus.

640
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,809
I couId Iive here.

641
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:33,946
I've been Iiving in La Honda for four years.

642
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:36,149
WeII, weIcome home, Tiny.

643
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:48,668
- How Iong to buiId another prototype?
- No time, just parts.

644
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:50,728
Who's got the cash?

645
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:55,976
No, with rent, my ceIIphone,
gas for the Porsche, I'm maxed out.

646
00:53:57,379 --> 00:54:00,746
AnaIogue economic redistribution.

647
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:03,614
- Huh?
- You seII some of your stuff.

648
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:06,449
No, I didn't mean
we shouId get rid of the Porsche!

649
00:54:06,522 --> 00:54:12,256
Anything but the Porsche! Oh, no!
It's cooI and it's fast and it's bIack...

650
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:36,784
- Hi.
- Hi.

651
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,344
I'm AIisa.

652
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:41,916
- What's your name?
- Curtis.

653
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:45,216
Tiny.

654
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:47,228
Hi, Tiny.

655
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:50,855
You know, you have reaIIy deIicate hands.

656
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:53,527
Do you work with your hands a Iot?

657
00:54:57,606 --> 00:54:59,335
Here.

658
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,077
It's done. And I came up with the name.

659
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:06,376
How about the eMagi?

660
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:09,178
- EIectronic magic.
- Yeah. How about the eCoIi?

661
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:13,085
- Hah! Show me.
- It's crufty, but it works.

662
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:17,183
WeII, Iet's try it. Where's Tiny's hypnotizer?

663
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,187
Where's Tiny?

664
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:25,697
Tiny, where's the hypnotizer?

665
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,035
Tiny?

666
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:34,203
- Tiny?
- Wrong ear.

667
00:55:34,276 --> 00:55:38,610
He sIeeps with aIternating sides of his brain,
Iike a bottIenose porpoise.

668
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:41,949
Tiny? Tiny...

669
00:55:42,017 --> 00:55:43,951
Wake up, Drumpy!

670
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:46,749
- Tiny? The hypnotizer.
- Where is it?

671
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:52,156
Smoke test.

672
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:15,041
Desktop ready. PIease seIect icon.

673
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,180
MaiIbox.

674
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:22,481
It's amazing.

675
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:24,991
You have maiI. You have maiI.

676
00:56:27,095 --> 00:56:28,960
It works!

677
00:56:29,564 --> 00:56:31,759
- Yeah.
- It works! It works!

678
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,267
Yeah! Yeah!

679
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:40,263
- Amazing.
- Andy, it's so cooI!

680
00:56:40,342 --> 00:56:44,244
It's... beautifuI. It's magic!

681
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:47,782
The eMagi.

682
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:49,817
The eMagi? I win!

683
00:56:51,186 --> 00:56:54,417
I get a night out with my girIfriend.
When do I get to go?

684
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:57,322
WeII, how about tonight? We'II aII go.

685
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:59,550
- No.
- Why? It'II be fun.

686
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,926
We'II aII bring dates.

687
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:09,001
That's not fair. To DarreII and Tiny, I mean.
They don't have a DS.

688
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:11,733
- Neither do you!
- Do too.

689
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:15,799
TeII you what, angry man.
You bring a date and we'II doubIe.

690
00:57:15,877 --> 00:57:18,402
Hah. Check and mate.

691
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,108
Fine. Bahia Cabana. Eight o'cIock.

692
00:57:24,953 --> 00:57:29,083
And we'II see who brings a DS.
Oh, and for the record,

693
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:32,854
a bIow-up doII does not count as a DS.

694
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:46,067
Our first pitch is tomorrow, so tonight
we're gonna ceIebrate. Wanna come?

695
00:57:46,141 --> 00:57:48,200
It's a trip...

696
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:52,679
It's a tripIe date. DarreII,
SaIman and me, pIus dates.

697
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:57,417
- What about Curtis?
- Tiny? He can't get a date.

698
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:00,046
- He's too shy.
- Oh, pIease!

699
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,889
- Here he is.
- Who?

700
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:13,901
Tiny? With a girI?!

701
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,937
I got a date. I got a reaI date!

702
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:20,338
- Did you caII her for him?
- No, I just heId his hand whiIe he caIIed.

703
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:24,402
The shortest, weirdest phone caII
you have ever heard.

704
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:45,556
Hey, SaIman!

705
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:02,816
Sorry, SaIman. I thought you had a girIfriend.

706
00:59:02,884 --> 00:59:05,876
I do. I've just never met her.

707
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:09,549
- We chat aII the time onIine.
- What's her name?

708
00:59:09,624 --> 00:59:12,957
FoxyLady33@AOL.

709
00:59:13,428 --> 00:59:17,626
- Ask her out, dude.
- She'II say no. She's Foxy Lady.

710
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,399
If you never ask, you'II never know.

711
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:24,337
Tiny asked, he got a date,
and DarreII didn't even show.

712
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:27,933
DarreII's here. He's aIready cIaimed victory.
They're dancing.

713
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:18,785
Hey, SaIman, come on. Come on.

714
01:00:41,616 --> 01:00:45,313
OK. Oh yeah. Not much further.

715
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:48,746
You ready?

716
01:00:58,433 --> 01:01:02,893
Oh, Andy, this is... very, very cooI.

717
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:08,871
Isn't it beautifuI?

718
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:13,839
SimpIified, cIarified... economized.

719
01:01:16,785 --> 01:01:18,844
I just wanna touch it with my hands.

720
01:01:22,991 --> 01:01:25,391
I know just how you feeI.

721
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:39,837
- The Dow sIipped 35 points...
- The NASDAQ index Iost 141/2...

722
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:43,708
The New York stock exchange
composite feII to 5621/2...

723
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:52,877
Ride me, cowboy, ride me!

724
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,151
Wow. Terrific. This is something.

725
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:02,496
I'II just give my friend at La Honda a caII.

726
01:02:02,564 --> 01:02:05,795
If your references check out,
we've got ourseIves a deaI.

727
01:02:07,602 --> 01:02:10,002
CaroI, get me Francis, wiII ya?

728
01:02:10,705 --> 01:02:14,266
You haven't given much thought
to the Iook of it.

729
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:21,176
Our design team is working as we speak.

730
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:24,650
We'II have a cosmetic prototype in...

731
01:02:26,254 --> 01:02:28,245
a coupIe of days.

732
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:34,924
- Times are a IittIe tougher than I thought.
- A IittIe? Can you see this?

733
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:37,430
It'd be easier to seII sand in Baghdad.

734
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:40,366
This is grim, Andy. We're aImost out of food.

735
01:02:40,435 --> 01:02:45,338
Maybe we couId get an ISP partner -
EarthLink or MindSpring or ModNet?

736
01:02:45,407 --> 01:02:48,399
- I have a friend at ModNet.
- What?!

737
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:52,412
You have a friend at ModNet? Why the heII
didn't we go there in the first pIace?

738
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,947
A former friend.

739
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:57,883
Andy?

740
01:02:58,386 --> 01:02:59,944
Andy!

741
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:06,557
Andy, I wanna formaIIy apoIogize for hookin'
up with Robin Iike that. It was totaIIy uncooI.

742
01:03:07,862 --> 01:03:11,491
Oh. So you're not seeing her anymore?

743
01:03:11,566 --> 01:03:13,864
No. We're gettin' married.

744
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:16,369
- Yeah. Gotcha.
- She said she'd never get married.

745
01:03:16,438 --> 01:03:20,204
She said she'd never do a Iot of things.
Money changes everything.

746
01:03:20,275 --> 01:03:24,803
ModNet's buyin' up faiIed dotcoms
for peanuts. I'm worth a piIe!

747
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:27,347
HeII, my Iife's perfect.
Let's go seII the oId man.

748
01:03:27,415 --> 01:03:29,781
- Is this the posse?
- Yeah.

749
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:33,343
- Uh, guys, this is WiIIy, my old friend.
- Best friend.

750
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:38,449
Andy's personaIIy responsibIe for hookin'
me up with the most insaneIy hot chick.

751
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:41,359
- How you doin'? Hi.
- Get off!

752
01:03:43,965 --> 01:03:46,160
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

753
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:50,637
DarreII here has personaI space issues.
I probabIy shouId've said something.

754
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:54,698
Yeah, weII, just keep him
away from the oId man.

755
01:03:56,411 --> 01:03:57,378
OK.

756
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:02,546
WeII, weII, weII.

757
01:04:02,617 --> 01:04:05,780
So... what have you kids got for me?

758
01:04:06,521 --> 01:04:09,115
That's the oId man?

759
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,261
I want you to remember how you feeI today.

760
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:21,601
Because you're gonna teII the story
of this meeting for the rest of your Iives.

761
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:27,067
- I'm about to bestow upon you...
- Sorry I'm Iate.

762
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:29,571
HeIIo, Andy.

763
01:04:29,644 --> 01:04:33,546
I asked our head of marketing to join us.
Thanks, Robin.

764
01:04:35,617 --> 01:04:37,380
That's Robin?

765
01:04:38,386 --> 01:04:41,822
You did it with that?! You are my god.

766
01:04:48,029 --> 01:04:50,463
- Andy!
- Yeah, um...

767
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:58,232
What we, uh... What we have here today, uh...

768
01:04:58,306 --> 01:05:00,536
It's a hoIogram.

769
01:05:00,608 --> 01:05:03,634
It's a hoIographic computer.

770
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:06,913
It's so ugIy.

771
01:05:06,981 --> 01:05:09,848
Uh... question. What the heII?

772
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:12,476
OK, Iight it up.

773
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,193
Oh, this is ajoke.

774
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:21,990
It's a... joke.

775
01:05:22,363 --> 01:05:23,523
It's...

776
01:05:23,598 --> 01:05:26,533
Is this what passes as ajoke these days?

777
01:05:26,601 --> 01:05:32,164
You know, I don't get you kids and
your sense of humor. GentIemen?

778
01:05:34,742 --> 01:05:38,337
Jesus, Andy! I toId him
you were money in the bank!

779
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:41,810
Won't be needing this.

780
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:46,219
I'm gonna have WiIIy's baby.

781
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:49,882
Look at you.
You're as pathetic as these Iosers.

782
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:54,126
OnIy difference is... you did it on purpose.

783
01:06:05,073 --> 01:06:09,169
What the heII happened in there?
You tried to sIug a chick!

784
01:06:09,744 --> 01:06:11,735
And you missed!

785
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,508
What was I thinking?

786
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:16,840
I had everything...

787
01:06:18,486 --> 01:06:20,818
and I threw it away.

788
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:25,252
You know, I don't even
remember why anymore.

789
01:06:31,299 --> 01:06:33,460
She's right. I am pathetic.

790
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:37,464
What have I become?

791
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:39,507
Who the heII am I?

792
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:42,702
Who the heII are you? What about us?

793
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:44,472
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

794
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:48,710
You said everything
wouId be aII right. Now what?

795
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:59,754
Ben, you know I can do this.

796
01:07:03,698 --> 01:07:05,689
You know I can do this.

797
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:24,411
- Yeah.
- Hey, Ben. It's Andy.

798
01:07:24,485 --> 01:07:27,977
- Andy!
- So, uh, how's things?

799
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,248
- I've been expecting this caII.
- You were?

800
01:07:32,694 --> 01:07:34,457
AII that ''joIt'' babbIe.

801
01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:37,965
I toId everybody Wonder Boy
wouId be back within two weeks.

802
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:44,062
You're a born saIesman, Andy.
Don't waste your taIents. Come on back.

803
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:49,833
ActuaIIy, Ben, I was caIIing to thank you.

804
01:07:52,046 --> 01:07:56,415
Yeah, I mean this job is...
more than I ever hoped for.

805
01:07:56,484 --> 01:08:00,352
Yeah. And I never feIt more aIive.

806
01:08:00,421 --> 01:08:03,447
Quit screwin' around, kiddo.
The cIimate is changing.

807
01:08:03,524 --> 01:08:05,458
We're entering an economic ice age.

808
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:10,862
Everybody wants yourjob. I can onIy
hoId it for you for another two weeks, max.

809
01:08:14,235 --> 01:08:16,430
OK, man. Thanks, Ben.

810
01:08:30,318 --> 01:08:34,084
- So why haven't your pitches gone weII?
- Oh, everyone's afraid.

811
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:36,214
They want to invest in a sure thing.

812
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:39,589
They see my piece of crap on their desk and...

813
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:44,621
I mean, in my head it's beautifuI. I don't see
the wires or the gIoves or the kIudge.

814
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:48,226
I just see this... beautifuI gIowing potentiaI.

815
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,105
BeautifuI gIowing potentiaI?

816
01:08:54,142 --> 01:08:56,610
Maybe I couId heIp you sexy up the Iook.

817
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:59,306
Wow, reaIIy? You'd do that for me?

818
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:05,381
It'd be a good project for me,
something I couId... finish.

819
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:11,055
I'd Iove to see how you'd sexy it up,
but I'm afraid it's too Iate.

820
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,421
ReaIIy?

821
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:18,064
That's too bad.

822
01:09:18,866 --> 01:09:20,527
Yeah.

823
01:09:21,436 --> 01:09:23,597
It's too bad.

824
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:27,841
WeII... thank you for today.

825
01:09:28,843 --> 01:09:30,708
No, thank you.

826
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:33,212
I reaIIy needed this.

827
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:36,250
So what are you gonna do now?
Go back to Omega?

828
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:41,152
No. No way. Leaving Omega
was the best decision I ever made.

829
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:44,483
But it's a IittIe scary, though, huh?

830
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:46,550
Yeah, a bit.

831
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:51,294
But you know what?
I shouId feeI awfuI and I don't.

832
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:56,302
I've Iost everything that
I thought was important, but...

833
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,702
I feeI... Iight.

834
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:02,105
AIive.

835
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:07,978
I have no money, no job, but I know
something'II happen. I'II make it happen.

836
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:11,243
I bet you wiII.

837
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:17,890
So is... this that part of the movie?

838
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:21,588
No.

839
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:25,324
- Not yet.
- Damn.

840
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,691
Not much Ionger.

841
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:30,400
Good night.

842
01:10:57,298 --> 01:10:59,789
- What's going on?
- Andy!

843
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:04,466
- We've been trying to caII you.
- What the heII is Mrs B gonna say?

844
01:11:04,539 --> 01:11:06,700
CocktaiI, Andy?

845
01:11:06,774 --> 01:11:09,072
OK...

846
01:11:09,143 --> 01:11:11,611
She wants to invest.

847
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:14,104
- What?
- She wants to invest.

848
01:11:14,182 --> 01:11:17,515
She wants to give us
the money to finish the eMagi.

849
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:20,053
- Who?
- It was Miss CIaudia Goss.

850
01:11:20,822 --> 01:11:23,518
She wants us to come back
with our new design.

851
01:11:23,591 --> 01:11:27,322
- New design?!
- She needs it tomorrow morning.

852
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:30,320
Tomorrow? Shit!

853
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:33,631
Tomorrow? Shit!

854
01:11:34,969 --> 01:11:37,130
Come on. The studio.

855
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,998
It's gonna need a wide base, a fIat base,

856
01:11:41,075 --> 01:11:44,374
ventiIation and access ports
for both power and Internet.

857
01:11:44,445 --> 01:11:48,973
- But it needs to be short this way, with a...
- I'm sorry. Andy...

858
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:52,351
I don't think I can do this. I'm sorry.

859
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:56,584
I'm not used to having
aII these ruIes and specs.

860
01:11:58,593 --> 01:12:00,254
NewsfIash.

861
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:06,597
Sometimes... it's OK to know
what it is you're doing whiIe you're doing it.

862
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:11,198
OK.

863
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,371
At Ieast I'II know when I'm done.

864
01:12:18,579 --> 01:12:20,069
Thank you.

865
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,711
You're weIcome.

866
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:32,082
Sit down. Let me do this.

867
01:12:35,963 --> 01:12:39,626
I'm changing into my smock. No peeking.

868
01:12:42,737 --> 01:12:44,728
Andy?

869
01:13:01,555 --> 01:13:04,547
Andy? Andy, wake up.

870
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:07,117
- Hey.
- I'm done.

871
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:09,320
TemporariIy done.

872
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:11,425
Wow.

873
01:13:12,266 --> 01:13:15,258
Avocado. That's awesome.

874
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:23,400
I just thought it was so hi-tech,
it shouId have an organic coIor.

875
01:13:29,984 --> 01:13:32,817
WeII... good night.

876
01:13:33,988 --> 01:13:35,979
It's aImost sunrise.

877
01:13:38,526 --> 01:13:40,426
Good morning.

878
01:14:18,332 --> 01:14:19,390
Hi.

879
01:14:20,368 --> 01:14:23,132
I Iove this song.

880
01:14:23,204 --> 01:14:28,232
- Where'd you find it?
- I used to have this kick-ass CD coIIection...

881
01:14:49,096 --> 01:14:55,660
FrankIy, I'm a... IittIe concerned
about Mrs B's ''no hanky-panky'' cIause.

882
01:15:34,809 --> 01:15:40,805
What is this? Some kind of a kinky...
sensory-deprivation sex thing?

883
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:43,815
- Yes.
- Whoa!

884
01:15:43,884 --> 01:15:47,149
WeII, Iet's hope I Iast Ionger than the piIIow.

885
01:16:15,549 --> 01:16:17,141
Andy!

886
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:19,379
We have to go. We can't be Iate.

887
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:21,887
What did you do? BIow up a chicken?

888
01:16:21,956 --> 01:16:24,754
Tiny, hurry up! Let's go! Get dressed!

889
01:16:26,227 --> 01:16:28,491
We gotta go. We're Iate. PIease hurry.

890
01:16:28,562 --> 01:16:31,087
Let's get in the car. Get in the car.

891
01:16:33,767 --> 01:16:36,793
No. HoId it, guys.
You can't go dressed Iike that.

892
01:16:54,788 --> 01:17:01,853
What if I start you and your troops out on
a grand a month per person Iiving expenses?

893
01:17:02,863 --> 01:17:04,660
Sorry, CIaudia.

894
01:17:04,732 --> 01:17:08,395
Big nums or no nums. 2500 a month each.

895
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:12,970
- OK...
- PIus 200 Gs operating expenses.

896
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:18,570
And you buy my Porsche back?

897
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:23,847
Fine. 200,000.

898
01:17:27,421 --> 01:17:30,219
For 51% of the company.

899
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:35,754
51% ? No way, Andy.
She'II have us by the prick.

900
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:38,627
- I don't Iike this 51%.
- Let's face reaIity, boys.

901
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:41,190
Six months ago
aII you had to do was say ''dotcom''

902
01:17:41,268 --> 01:17:44,601
and you'd have investors aII over you
Iike foam on a Frappuccino.

903
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:49,939
But those days are over. This is
a buyer's market and, as far as I can teII,

904
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,501
nobody's buying.

905
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,207
Sidebar.

906
01:17:54,281 --> 01:17:59,150
AII right, I know this is a big risk, but
everything we've done has been a big risk.

907
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:04,283
And I know 51% sucks, but it's our onIy offer.
We don't have a choice.

908
01:18:05,025 --> 01:18:07,186
We're out of options.

909
01:18:09,463 --> 01:18:11,454
200 grand?

910
01:18:15,536 --> 01:18:17,561
- We're in.
- Great.

911
01:18:20,641 --> 01:18:24,805
- Let's ceIebrate  Ia Caspar.
-  Ia Caspar? What the heII is that?

912
01:18:31,685 --> 01:18:34,620
eMagi!

913
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:42,452
This is it.

914
01:18:44,398 --> 01:18:47,890
- Oh, my god...
- DarreII Iikes.

915
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:50,562
- That is a work of art.
- Tiny. AssembIy.

916
01:18:53,874 --> 01:18:55,967
- Yeah.
- Oh, cooI.

917
01:18:56,043 --> 01:18:58,102
Come on, come on.

918
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:01,309
Oh, yeah.

919
01:19:01,382 --> 01:19:03,646
This is the first eMagi assembIed!

920
01:19:04,585 --> 01:19:07,019
I think it's time for a photo op.

921
01:19:07,488 --> 01:19:11,151
You guys are making history.
Gather cIose to Tiny.

922
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:15,122
Hey. We are iron men!

923
01:19:16,764 --> 01:19:18,425
Yeah!

924
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,709
HeIIo?

925
01:19:31,245 --> 01:19:34,214
- Hey, CIaudia.
- We need to have a board meeting.

926
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:35,976
Guys, we're havin' a board meeting.

927
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:38,644
- CooI.
- Just Iike we're grown-ups.

928
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:49,686
This morning I received an offer
from Just Everywhere Inc

929
01:19:49,763 --> 01:19:53,893
to purchase the eMagi outright for $409,000.

930
01:19:56,403 --> 01:20:00,169
WeII, I think I speak
for aII of us when I say... no.

931
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,334
And I think I speak as the majority
sharehoIder when I say...

932
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,776
what you aII say means preciseIy dick.

933
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:10,681
So... 49% of 409,000,
minus the 200 advance,

934
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:15,814
Ieaves you with a grand totaI
of $410 of pure profit. CongratuIations.

935
01:20:15,889 --> 01:20:19,848
- $410? You're kidding!
- The movers shouId be here by four.

936
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:24,523
- We spent the advance aIready.
- Great doing business with you. Bye.

937
01:20:32,873 --> 01:20:35,501
Who the heII is Just Everywhere anyway?

938
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:38,739
You haven't heard the Iast of us!
You didn't even ask us!

939
01:20:38,812 --> 01:20:42,304
She didn't have to ask us.
You gave her 51% of the eMagi.

940
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:46,012
Christ, we trusted you, Andy.
We thought you knew what you were doing.

941
01:20:46,086 --> 01:20:49,055
- Hey, what's up?
- We have nothing.

942
01:20:49,123 --> 01:20:51,455
We have nothing and we're broke.

943
01:20:55,396 --> 01:20:57,523
Who's gonna teII DarreII?

944
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:12,777
Poverty sucks. Look at this machine, guys.

945
01:21:13,447 --> 01:21:17,781
Huh? Does money buy happiness? I think so.

946
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:21,352
You teII him.

947
01:21:23,123 --> 01:21:27,685
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know I Iet you guys
down and I know we have nothing.

948
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:32,198
But we've been here before, right?
And we've come through before, right?

949
01:21:32,266 --> 01:21:37,329
Right. OK. Here it is.
State records office, civic center. Let's go.

950
01:21:38,972 --> 01:21:41,463
- Come on, Iet's go!
- WouId you stop doin' that?

951
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:46,568
They're in San Jose. New company,
not even in the computer yet.

952
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:48,638
Keep off the foot.

953
01:21:56,056 --> 01:21:58,581
Come on, guys. Let's kick some ass!

954
01:21:58,659 --> 01:22:00,650
Look.

955
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:10,497
Francis is Just Everywhere.

956
01:22:13,207 --> 01:22:15,334
There you are, you engineering puke!

957
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:19,106
Caspar, it's good to see you.
Security'II be here any minute.

958
01:22:19,179 --> 01:22:23,616
- Do you think you'II get away with this?
- This is wonderfuI. I'm very impressed.

959
01:22:23,684 --> 01:22:28,087
PIease pass aIong my compIiments
to the rest of your team. Where are they?

960
01:22:28,155 --> 01:22:29,986
Oh, there they are.

961
01:22:30,057 --> 01:22:33,493
You screwed them! You screwed me!
You screwed aII of us.

962
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,391
This is the new ''new thing.''

963
01:22:35,462 --> 01:22:41,401
I am so confident that I broke a cardinaI ruIe
and I invested my own money into the eMagi.

964
01:22:41,468 --> 01:22:44,835
That was your eviI pIan?
Get me to design a revoIutionary computer

965
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:47,396
so you couId steaI it and get rich?!

966
01:22:47,474 --> 01:22:52,468
You are seriousIy paranoid, man.
I onIy wanted to get rid of you.

967
01:22:52,546 --> 01:22:57,313
It wasn't untiI I reaIized what you had
come up with that this became my eviI pIan.

968
01:22:57,384 --> 01:23:01,218
- I'm gonna kiII you!
- KiII me? You shouId thank me.

969
01:23:01,788 --> 01:23:04,552
Of aII the peopIe I've worked with,
you're one of the few

970
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:09,824
who made it worth my whiIe to screw them.
This is an enormous compIiment.

971
01:23:17,137 --> 01:23:19,264
999?

972
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:22,498
- We made it for 99.
- Right.

973
01:23:22,576 --> 01:23:25,340
But... if I charge $900 more,

974
01:23:25,412 --> 01:23:29,712
every time I seII one, I make $900 more.

975
01:23:31,585 --> 01:23:33,519
Oh. Looks Iike your time is up.

976
01:23:35,255 --> 01:23:37,382
Mr Caspar?

977
01:23:37,457 --> 01:23:41,518
We can do this the easy way...
or the hard way.

978
01:23:44,598 --> 01:23:47,192
- The easy way, pIease.
- Damn.

979
01:23:48,068 --> 01:23:52,528
Late breaking news. SiIicon guru
Francis Benoit has quit La Honda

980
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:54,130
to go for the money.

981
01:23:54,207 --> 01:23:57,370
Benoit cIaims to have deveIoped
an eIectrifying new invention

982
01:23:57,444 --> 01:24:00,106
that wiII compIeteIy change our Iives.

983
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:03,815
I had a dream...

984
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:08,218
that I couId make something
and it wouId touch everyone's Iives.

985
01:24:08,288 --> 01:24:11,223
And we did it! We made it!

986
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:14,260
And Francis came and stoIe it from me.

987
01:24:14,895 --> 01:24:17,489
He stoIe my dream.

988
01:24:18,498 --> 01:24:23,458
No. He stoIe your thing, not your dream.

989
01:24:24,571 --> 01:24:29,941
It's Iike... when you paint a painting
and you seII it.

990
01:24:30,477 --> 01:24:34,846
You Iose the painting,
but you stiII keep the inspiration.

991
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:40,111
You soId the painting.
Now just paint a new one.

992
01:24:41,154 --> 01:24:45,056
It's not that simpIe. I can'tjust... take a crayon

993
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:48,288
and... sketch a new computer.

994
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:54,765
Can't you guys just use some of your
oId stuff? What exactIy do you stiII own?

995
01:24:56,236 --> 01:24:57,703
Nothing.

996
01:25:22,429 --> 01:25:24,454
Ben and Jerry's!

997
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:27,828
Ice cream?

998
01:25:33,373 --> 01:25:37,810
- Guess what, guys. I had a vision.
- Did it invoIve Third WorId schooIkids?

999
01:25:37,878 --> 01:25:41,405
No, it invoIves a nonexcIusive
agreement and a tube of KY.

1000
01:25:41,481 --> 01:25:47,044
Screwing Francis in a very pubIic,
demeaning and humiIiating way.

1001
01:25:49,256 --> 01:25:52,191
- Look at that. DarreII smiIed.
- Did not.

1002
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:56,055
It was a faciaI spasm!

1003
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:58,597
Guys, do you have any idea
what we accompIished?

1004
01:25:58,665 --> 01:26:01,930
We cracked the gene code,
we buiIt a space station.

1005
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:05,369
We created a workout that
tones your abs in onIy six minutes a day.

1006
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,035
We took the most unwanted, uncooI
WOMBAT project and we spun it into goId!

1007
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:14,408
- And it turned to shit.
- No, it didn't. It was just stoIen.

1008
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:16,745
And we can get it back. Listen.

1009
01:26:17,317 --> 01:26:22,880
We deveIoped the eMagi at La Honda, which
means Hank co-owns the rights, remember?

1010
01:26:22,956 --> 01:26:28,155
If we get Hank on our side, we can use
our ideas, but we can take it much further.

1011
01:26:28,228 --> 01:26:34,531
BIow Francis away with something cooIer,
faster... smaIIer. The next generation eMagi.

1012
01:26:34,601 --> 01:26:37,263
The uItimate. We go aII the way to the Iimit.

1013
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:41,901
- Who's with me?
- I'm with you.

1014
01:26:46,146 --> 01:26:48,546
- I gotta get going, guys.
- Where are you going?

1015
01:26:48,615 --> 01:26:50,276
FoxyLady33.

1016
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:53,709
- You don't have to pretend...
- I asked her out.

1017
01:26:53,787 --> 01:26:57,279
She's arriving at the ferry terminaI
in 56 minutes.

1018
01:26:57,357 --> 01:27:02,056
- She's reaI?
- His Docking Station's at the docking station.

1019
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:04,393
But... our new project?

1020
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:08,395
No, we do his project
before we do any project.

1021
01:27:12,272 --> 01:27:19,110
OK. OK, I'II heIp SaIman with his project,
you guys... stay here and brainstorm.

1022
01:27:19,179 --> 01:27:21,306
Brainstorm what?

1023
01:27:22,415 --> 01:27:25,350
No gIoves, no wires, no nothing.

1024
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:33,949
What if she's some kind of freakoid?

1025
01:27:34,027 --> 01:27:38,020
What kind of person agrees to meet
a person she met on the Internet?

1026
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:41,625
What about me? I couId be
a weirdo for aII she knows.

1027
01:27:43,804 --> 01:27:45,795
Go get her, Robin Hood.

1028
01:27:45,872 --> 01:27:47,737
If she is a ''her.''

1029
01:28:02,589 --> 01:28:05,820
Benoit quits La Honda.
More on that story.

1030
01:28:05,892 --> 01:28:08,759
In a quick response, Omega's LIoyd Acheson

1031
01:28:08,829 --> 01:28:11,662
has abruptIy haIted
La Honda's corporate funding,

1032
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:15,963
Ieaving the VaIIey's premier research Iab
in a state of compIete chaos.

1033
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:19,028
Hank! Hank! We're here to save La Honda.

1034
01:28:19,105 --> 01:28:21,266
We got it. We got the answer right here.

1035
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:24,310
I had a dream, Hank,
and I thought it was gone.

1036
01:28:24,377 --> 01:28:27,608
- And then I remembered... you stiII have it.
- StiII have what?

1037
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,172
- Ben and Jerry's!
- The nonexcIusive waiver.

1038
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,912
Give me 30 iron men, a month,
and we'II naiI Francis.

1039
01:28:32,986 --> 01:28:36,046
There's onIy about seven guys Ieft,
eight if you incIude me.

1040
01:28:36,122 --> 01:28:39,148
You can have 'em tiII the power shuts off.

1041
01:28:39,226 --> 01:28:42,252
- We're gonna ravage Francis with this.
- OK.

1042
01:28:44,364 --> 01:28:46,355
Hey, guys!

1043
01:28:47,767 --> 01:28:50,327
FoxyLady33 is Janie HickenIocker?!

1044
01:28:50,403 --> 01:28:53,065
- Foxy HickenIocker!
- HeIIo, boys.

1045
01:28:53,139 --> 01:28:55,130
SmaII worId, huh?

1046
01:28:55,876 --> 01:28:58,276
Ride me, cowboy!

1047
01:28:58,345 --> 01:29:00,279
Guys, Iet's get to work.

1048
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:04,810
Let's crank it up, guys.
Francis is going pubIic in 10 days.

1049
01:29:04,885 --> 01:29:07,353
You aII know what you need to do.

1050
01:29:07,954 --> 01:29:11,754
Caspar's team are buiIding something
at La Honda. They're using the Titan X.

1051
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:15,022
The Titan was never finished.
Caspar's team has nothing.

1052
01:29:15,095 --> 01:29:19,259
I have the eMagi and 100,000 preorders.

1053
01:29:19,332 --> 01:29:21,926
Wow. And we haven't even
shown it to the backers yet.

1054
01:29:22,002 --> 01:29:26,701
Listen. Listen to some of these orders.
NASA's ordered 25,000.

1055
01:29:26,773 --> 01:29:29,867
The KuaIa Lumpur Department
of Transportation wants 50,000.

1056
01:29:29,943 --> 01:29:33,811
Some institute in Sedona I don't know
wants 10,000...

1057
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,317
Hey, Tiny. How you doin'?

1058
01:29:44,391 --> 01:29:47,087
Not doing. Done.

1059
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,650
Yeah!

1060
01:29:50,363 --> 01:29:54,561
Now that's what you wouId caII...
in the nick of time.

1061
01:29:56,803 --> 01:30:01,297
Synchronize your watches. I have 9:13. We've
exactIy Iess than two hours to get to Francis.

1062
01:30:01,374 --> 01:30:04,571
- ''ExactIy Iess than''?
- We're synchronizing watches. CooI.

1063
01:30:04,644 --> 01:30:06,771
Hey, Tiny! Let's roII!

1064
01:30:07,847 --> 01:30:10,008
Tiny, break it up!

1065
01:30:13,787 --> 01:30:15,846
Big excitement in San Jose

1066
01:30:15,922 --> 01:30:19,915
as SiIicon VaIIey's eIite jostIe
for a gIimpse of the new ''new thing,''

1067
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:23,190
Francis Benoit's so-caIIed
revoIutionary computer.

1068
01:30:23,263 --> 01:30:27,324
Wraps come off at preciseIy 11,
when the top pIayers get to bid for the rights.

1069
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,530
MeanwhiIe, security here at
Just Everywhere is hi-tech and tight.

1070
01:30:31,604 --> 01:30:35,404
- We've got five minutes to get in there.
- And Tiny's missing in action.

1071
01:30:35,475 --> 01:30:39,309
- WeII, he's just gonna have to meet us inside.
- If we get inside.

1072
01:30:39,379 --> 01:30:41,643
Don't worry. SaIman's on it. Right, SaIman?

1073
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:46,818
Recursive security aIgorithms?
Hah! Bring it, bitch.

1074
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,115
Go for it, Andy.

1075
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:51,020
Right thumb on the pad, pIease.

1076
01:30:53,226 --> 01:30:55,057
HoId it stiII.

1077
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:58,859
Next!

1078
01:31:05,405 --> 01:31:07,873
ControI the computers
and you're unstoppabIe.

1079
01:31:07,941 --> 01:31:09,738
HeIIo again, Mr Caspar.

1080
01:31:10,744 --> 01:31:14,180
We have to stop meeting Iike this.

1081
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:16,609
UnstoppabIe, huh?

1082
01:31:16,683 --> 01:31:20,016
- This way, SaIman.
- Guys, go with the pIan!

1083
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:24,446
Inside, inside.

1084
01:31:32,799 --> 01:31:35,666
Exciting, isn't it? Something in the air.

1085
01:31:35,735 --> 01:31:40,069
Francis Benoit, aIways miIes ahead,
has something new.

1086
01:31:40,507 --> 01:31:42,498
Quick, in here!

1087
01:31:43,576 --> 01:31:47,034
- What you see today wiII chaIIenge...
- Shit, we're not gonna make it!

1088
01:31:47,113 --> 01:31:49,206
I can't beIieve we got this cIose!

1089
01:31:49,282 --> 01:31:53,184
Today's computer is 50,000 times faster
than the first computer

1090
01:31:53,253 --> 01:31:56,188
and it can hoId
a miIIion times the information.

1091
01:31:56,256 --> 01:31:58,247
And tomorrow's computer?

1092
01:31:59,859 --> 01:32:03,522
- What the heII are you guys doin'?
- Keep goin', SaIman.

1093
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:07,362
We can do this the easy way...
or the hard way.

1094
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:10,696
You know what's in this bottIe, tough guy?

1095
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,904
Tetrodotoxin.

1096
01:32:13,273 --> 01:32:15,241
DeadIier than cyanide.

1097
01:32:15,308 --> 01:32:18,277
Within ten minutes, your body goes numb...

1098
01:32:19,112 --> 01:32:21,478
and then the paraIysis sets in.

1099
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:23,948
In 30 minutes... you're dead.

1100
01:32:24,951 --> 01:32:27,442
Care to give it a try?

1101
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,750
Nice try, but you'd die too.

1102
01:32:29,823 --> 01:32:31,620
DarreII's been inocuIated.

1103
01:32:37,197 --> 01:32:41,600
WeIcome, friends from around the worId.
Let's get started, OK?

1104
01:32:43,236 --> 01:32:45,431
Come on, throw me your security card.

1105
01:32:53,913 --> 01:32:57,246
It's aII right, SaIman. It's just Mountain Dew.

1106
01:32:57,317 --> 01:32:59,182
Where's the card? Where's the card?

1107
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:00,879
Oh, shit.

1108
01:33:12,866 --> 01:33:14,857
Live dangerousIy.

1109
01:33:15,969 --> 01:33:18,870
Kick ass, DarreII. We've onIy got a minute.

1110
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:26,336
Ladies and gentIemen, I want you to meet
the future... a hoIographic computer

1111
01:33:26,813 --> 01:33:28,644
for about $1,000.

1112
01:33:31,584 --> 01:33:33,848
BehoId... the eMagi.

1113
01:33:41,828 --> 01:33:43,796
Eat fIaming death, Francis!

1114
01:33:52,405 --> 01:33:55,067
Christ, WiIIiamson,
didn't we aIready pass on this?

1115
01:33:55,141 --> 01:33:58,201
A demonstration isn't compIete
without the customary gIitch.

1116
01:34:10,957 --> 01:34:13,551
- Tiny?
- Francis.

1117
01:34:13,626 --> 01:34:16,186
What are you doing here?

1118
01:34:18,598 --> 01:34:22,762
PeriIs of a downsized economy.
DisgruntIed former empIoyees.

1119
01:34:25,705 --> 01:34:29,038
AII right, Tiny. Now just waddIe on home.

1120
01:34:30,143 --> 01:34:32,077
Go on!

1121
01:34:32,145 --> 01:34:34,705
- Now where were we?
- Francis!

1122
01:34:39,285 --> 01:34:41,446
Hank, what is this?
You don't know.

1123
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:43,580
What's going on?

1124
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:50,395
My name's Curtis Reese...
and I heIped design the eMagi

1125
01:34:50,463 --> 01:34:52,897
before Francis stoIe it!

1126
01:35:11,484 --> 01:35:13,748
Andy?

1127
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:22,588
ExceIIent prank, Caspar.
Now just do the pee-pee dance on home.

1128
01:35:22,662 --> 01:35:24,630
Sit down and shut up, Francis!

1129
01:35:38,044 --> 01:35:42,310
Hi. I'm Andy Caspar, and this is my team.

1130
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:45,075
And we made the eMagi.

1131
01:35:46,953 --> 01:35:50,013
- And I'm here to teII you a secret.
- What secret?

1132
01:35:56,129 --> 01:35:57,960
It wasn't finished.

1133
01:35:58,331 --> 01:36:02,631
The eMagi's cooI, but it was onIy a step
aIong the way towards our uItimate goaI -

1134
01:36:02,702 --> 01:36:05,569
to simpIify, to cIarify, to economize.

1135
01:36:05,638 --> 01:36:09,972
- AII right, enough.
- Wait! I wanna hear what the kid has to say.

1136
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:14,579
We're Iight years beyond Francis.

1137
01:36:14,647 --> 01:36:19,050
The eMagi isn't tomorrow's computer.
It's yesterday's prototype.

1138
01:36:21,487 --> 01:36:24,684
This is tomorrow's computer.

1139
01:36:31,064 --> 01:36:33,589
PowerfuI, portabIe...

1140
01:36:34,801 --> 01:36:37,201
and one-tenth the price.

1141
01:36:54,887 --> 01:36:57,185
Hi. I'm Caspar.

1142
01:36:58,391 --> 01:37:00,757
The friendIy... hoIogram.

1143
01:37:02,462 --> 01:37:06,091
I think it was... God who said...

1144
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:09,658
''Let there be... Iight.''

1145
01:37:20,046 --> 01:37:22,105
HoIy shit!

1146
01:37:22,448 --> 01:37:25,076
Whoa. Check it out!

1147
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:27,346
Amazing!

1148
01:37:28,221 --> 01:37:29,779
BeautifuI!

1149
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,915
It doesn't suck!

1150
01:37:31,991 --> 01:37:35,518
Don't be shy.
Put your hands into the hoIogram.

1151
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:40,866
Let the Iasers find your fingers.

1152
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:45,234
Touch the souI of your computer.

1153
01:37:59,852 --> 01:38:02,013
UnbeIievabIe!

1154
01:38:50,169 --> 01:38:53,570
- No shame in crying.
- DarreII doesn't cry.

1155
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:56,199
DarreII's... eyes sweat.

1156
01:38:57,977 --> 01:39:00,537
So, did you get yourjoIt?

1157
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,114
I'm about to.

1158
01:39:10,323 --> 01:39:13,190
Nice try, Caspar, but I stiII own the rights.

1159
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:16,854
- So do we, Francis.
- Concentrate, Francis.

1160
01:39:16,929 --> 01:39:20,729
Remember the nonexcIusive waiver?
I beIieve it was your idea.

1161
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,893
Awesome, Caspar.

1162
01:39:22,969 --> 01:39:27,838
Omega is no Ionger interested in the eMagi.
We're goin' with this baby. Hank?

1163
01:39:29,108 --> 01:39:31,372
Who do you think you are, Caspar?

1164
01:39:31,444 --> 01:39:34,538
I don't need anybody in this vaIIey.
I'm Francis Benoit.

1165
01:39:34,614 --> 01:39:38,778
I've got thousands of preorders
from customers around the worId.

1166
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:41,649
Lookee here. Here's one
of your worIdIy customers now.

1167
01:39:41,721 --> 01:39:44,849
The head of the KuaIa Lumpur
Department of Transportation.

1168
01:39:44,924 --> 01:39:48,587
- We bought 50,000 units.
- Here is NASA's Chief Purchasing Officer.

1169
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,959
25,000 units.

1170
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:53,794
And DarreII there runs
the Sedona Anger Institute.

1171
01:39:53,866 --> 01:39:56,460
- 10,000?
- 10,000.

1172
01:39:57,637 --> 01:40:03,598
Hey, but don't worry. As Iong as you didn't...
invest your own money...

1173
01:40:03,676 --> 01:40:07,669
Francis... you are so totaIIy in the toiIet.

1174
01:40:08,748 --> 01:40:09,737
Bye.

1175
01:40:11,017 --> 01:40:12,746
Very humiIiating.

1176
01:40:12,818 --> 01:40:14,809
Very demeaning.

1177
01:40:14,887 --> 01:40:17,048
Very pubIic.

1178
01:40:17,123 --> 01:40:21,219
Mr Benoit, I'd Iove
to have your comments, sir.

1179
01:40:23,229 --> 01:40:25,060
Thank you, Andy, thank you.

1180
01:40:25,131 --> 01:40:28,589
Thank me? Thank you guys.
I had nothing without you guys.

1181
01:40:28,668 --> 01:40:32,934
- Yeah, but you made us a team.
- You gave us a chance to shine.

1182
01:40:33,005 --> 01:40:35,439
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

1183
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:38,968
Thank you guys too.

1184
01:40:40,346 --> 01:40:42,746
Big-ups... to aII of you.

1185
01:40:50,623 --> 01:40:54,684
Oh, my God. DarreII, you connected.
You're actuaIIy touching us!

1186
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,854
I figured... my hand was just in the toiIet, so...
