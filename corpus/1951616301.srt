00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,046
<font color="#b9de12"><i>What do you expect</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>when you make them bait?</i></font>

5
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,227
<font color="#b9de12">You know, some people make a living</font>
<font color="#b9de12">playing those computer games.</font>

6
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,860
<font color="#b9de12">Sitting at a computer console playing</font>
<font color="#b9de12">first-person shooter games 24 hours a day</font>

00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,100
<font color="#b9de12">does not make you an athlete,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">it makes you a college applicant reject.</font>

8
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,272
<font color="#b9de12">Go on, move! Move! Move! Move!</font>

9
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,539
<font color="#b9de12">God, I always wondered what it'd be like</font>

10
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,344
<font color="#b9de12">sitting in a Trojan horse</font>
<font color="#b9de12">all day and all night.</font>

11
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,947
<font color="#b9de12">They just couldn't stay away</font>
<font color="#b9de12">from the fabled pot of gold.</font>

12
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,817
<font color="#b9de12">Move! Move!</font>

13
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,892
<font color="#b9de12">God. It looks like they got Sharon.</font>

14
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:40,660
<font color="#b9de12">I told her to leave.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">If she wants to be bait, I say let her be bait.</font>

15
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,435
<font color="#b9de12">You got our full payment up front, right?</font>

16
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,940
<font color="#b9de12">- What's she doing here anyway?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- She likes Vash.</font>

17
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,770
<font color="#b9de12">She's whacked.</font>

18
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,846
<font color="#b9de12">You know, the other day, her eyes</font>
<font color="#b9de12">were rolling in the back of her head.</font>

19
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,347
<font color="#b9de12">She was complaining of a headache.</font>

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,976
<font color="#b9de12">You know, so I asked her,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you know, if I could get her something,</font>

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,885
<font color="#b9de12">you know, like a glass of water.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She sends me to the damn pharmacy.</font>

22
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,822
<font color="#b9de12">Cost me over a hundred bucks.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Hasn't paid me back yet.</font>

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:10,191
<font color="#b9de12">That is nothing. I went to the pharmacy</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to get Denise's nebulizer. $160.</font>

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,122
<font color="#b9de12">- Is Tave in position?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,058
<font color="#b9de12">You know, I'm telling you</font>

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,434
<font color="#b9de12">your son is one of the best</font>
<font color="#b9de12">computer game players I've ever seen.</font>

27
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:24,102
<font color="#b9de12">Last summer, he spent 10 hours a day,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">every day, playing that damn game.</font>

28
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,078
<font color="#b9de12">If you had kids,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you'd change your tune, trust me.</font>

29
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,582
<font color="#b9de12">All right, I can see them all now.</font>

30
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,447
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe baby, let's open this Trojan horse.</font>

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,750
<font color="#b9de12">All right, Tave, we're moving.</font>

32
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,747
<font color="#b9de12">Rule number one, people?</font>

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,883
<font color="#b9de12">- We do not take a bullet...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- For a client.</font>

34
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,983
<font color="#b9de12">Amen.</font>

35
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,793
<font color="#b9de12">Combination!</font>

36
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,559
<font color="#b9de12">You know what I'd like to see?</font>

37
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
<font color="#b9de12">They've got steering wheels</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for the driving games, right?</font>

38
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,496
<font color="#b9de12">Like, joysticks that vibrate</font>

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,264
<font color="#b9de12">and all kinds of stuff</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for the flight sim games.</font>

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,034
<font color="#b9de12">What they need is a gun or a rifle</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for these first-person shooter games.</font>

41
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,632
<font color="#b9de12">I'm sure they have them.</font>

42
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,112
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, you'd have to aim, reload.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Have sensors so you can duck and stuff.</font>

43
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,714
<font color="#b9de12">And then maybe a foot pedal</font>

44
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,548
<font color="#b9de12">to control your movements</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and where you face, instead of a mouse.</font>

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,645
<font color="#b9de12">Any women play</font>
<font color="#b9de12">these first-person shooter games?</font>

46
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,053
<font color="#b9de12">Not you too, huh?</font>

47
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,524
<font color="#b9de12">I'd say less than 5%.</font>

48
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,261
<font color="#b9de12">So it's just a bunch of pale-skinned guys,</font>

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,526
<font color="#b9de12">sitting around, whose only meaningful</font>
<font color="#b9de12">relationships are with their DSL?</font>

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,624
<font color="#b9de12">Right? Is that what it is?</font>

51
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,568
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, those losers.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- All right. This hallway is clear.</font>

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,899
<font color="#b9de12">Thank God.</font>

53
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,206
<font color="#b9de12">- There's nothing here.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- She's right. There's nothing here!</font>

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,074
<font color="#b9de12">All right, all right.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We'll start beating her hand.</font>

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,084
<font color="#b9de12">I don't have the combination!</font>

56
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,620
<font color="#b9de12">You don't have to have it! No.</font>

57
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,218
<font color="#b9de12">You don't know what you're up against.</font>

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,418
<font color="#b9de12">It doesn't matter.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">They're gonna kill us anyway, Sharon.</font>

59
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:52,427
<font color="#b9de12">Sharon. Sharon Careington,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">here in the flesh.</font>

60
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,592
<font color="#b9de12">Your daddy is gonna get real pissed off.</font>

61
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,476
<font color="#b9de12">One guard, four hostages.</font>

62
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,989
<font color="#b9de12">So much for surprise.</font>

63
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,630
<font color="#b9de12">You know, Mabe, his son, Robert, is good.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">He's real good.</font>

64
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,693
<font color="#b9de12">See, that's exactly why I can't wait</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for you to get married and have kids.</font>

65
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,673
<font color="#b9de12">People running around cyberspace,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">killing each other with guns, is not real.</font>

66
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,074
<font color="#b9de12">At least if he makes a mistake online,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">he lives another day.</font>

67
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,476
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, hey, come on now, I shushed her.</font>

68
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,242
<font color="#b9de12">- She didn't shut up.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- What? I should shoot her?</font>

69
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,220
<font color="#b9de12">Move it! Sit down! Move! Move! Move! Move!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Sit down! Don't look up!</font>

70
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,051
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, my God, they're gonna kill us all.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Look at this.</font>

71
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,921
<font color="#b9de12">Look at this. They're lining us up.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">They're gonna kill us all one at a time.</font>

72
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,051
<font color="#b9de12">Somebody say something,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">do something to these people.</font>

73
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,461
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, my God, my wife.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I have a wife and a little girl at home.</font>

74
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,663
<font color="#b9de12">I just ordered a sports car.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Haven't even driven it yet.</font>

75
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,734
<font color="#b9de12">I love my car.</font>

76
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,783
<font color="#b9de12">You guys are getting sloppy.</font>

77
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,385
<font color="#b9de12">All right, Tave,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you and Mabe take care of these people.</font>

78
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,220
<font color="#b9de12">We'll clean up the last little bit.</font>

79
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,920
<font color="#b9de12">Please don't kill me yet.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I just bought a new HDTV.</font>

80
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,658
<font color="#b9de12">My wife hasn't finished her boob job.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Please don't shoot me.</font>

81
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,030
<font color="#b9de12">The other day, Robert was</font>
<font color="#b9de12">the last member of his team, right?</font>

82
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,592
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- His instincts were great, man.</font>

83
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,230
<font color="#b9de12">He was up against four pretty good players,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">he took each one of them out,</font>

84
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,740
<font color="#b9de12">the last one with a wall shot.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">He won the game.</font>

85
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,236
<font color="#b9de12">Precisely my point. It's a game.</font>

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,576
<font color="#b9de12">It's not just a game, man.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You can make a living in the CPL.</font>

87
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,714
<font color="#b9de12">- All right, freeze! Freeze!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Move that! Move it! Move in there!</font>

88
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,811
<font color="#b9de12">Move back! Move back! Move back!</font>

89
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,549
<font color="#b9de12">- Don't listen to him! Shoot!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- What did I say?</font>

90
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,286
<font color="#b9de12">- What did I tell you?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You bastard. My father will have you killed.</font>

91
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,989
<font color="#b9de12">You shut up, bitch!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Drop your gun right now!</font>

92
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,928
<font color="#b9de12">- Drop it right now!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Robert spent so much time...</font>

93
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,228
<font color="#b9de12">- Drop the gun right now!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">...on that game.</font>

94
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,893
<font color="#b9de12">I'm just starting to get a little bit jealous.</font>

95
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,096
<font color="#b9de12">Just think of all the hand-eye coordination</font>
<font color="#b9de12">he's getting</font>

96
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,071
<font color="#b9de12">- from the hours spent on the mouse.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Right.</font>

97
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,630
<font color="#b9de12">Drop your gun right now!</font>

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,472
<font color="#b9de12">I'm telling you guys!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Drop your gun right now!</font>

99
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,208
<font color="#b9de12">- You're a dead man! Don't listen to him.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You shut up!</font>

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,613
<font color="#b9de12">You got those SS109's?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">All I have are these soft 7.62's.</font>

101
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,742
<font color="#b9de12">- Oh, no.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Oh, yeah.</font>

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,046
<font color="#b9de12">- No.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes.</font>

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,144
<font color="#b9de12">- No.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes.</font>

104
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,552
<font color="#b9de12">Put your gun down right now!</font>

105
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,887
<font color="#b9de12">- Or I'll shoot her right now!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- We haven't been paid yet.</font>

106
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,621
<font color="#b9de12">Shoot the bastard! Now! I order you!</font>

107
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,290
<font color="#b9de12">She is ordering us.</font>

108
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,197
<font color="#b9de12">- Drop your gun right now!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Shoot!</font>

109
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,901
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe, come on in, bring your med kit.</font>

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,786
<font color="#b9de12">You tell him what...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Don't, don't let him tell you what to do.</font>

111
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,956
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, the MVP Award?</font>

112
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,660
<font color="#b9de12">How can you call him a little girl</font>
<font color="#b9de12">when you're the one who screamed?</font>

113
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,599
<font color="#b9de12">- You know what? I didn't just...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You're the one who screamed.</font>

114
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,967
<font color="#b9de12">You won't let it go. And you.</font>

115
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,199
<font color="#b9de12">You know how much coffee I had to drink</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to talk that fast?</font>

116
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,433
<font color="#b9de12">I will tell you one other thing.</font>

117
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,806
<font color="#b9de12">The next time I send you inside</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you are going in as a deaf mute.</font>

118
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,402
<font color="#b9de12">- Robert De Niro you ain't.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Okay, deaf mute.</font>

119
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,840
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Welcome to Billings Laboratories.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>How may I direct your call?</i></font>

120
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,016
<font color="#b9de12"><i>I'm sorry. Mr. Billings isn't taking any calls.</i></font>

121
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,555
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Would you like to speak</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>with his assistant, Monica?</i></font>

122
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,686
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Emily, I want you in on the test.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>But no one else. And it'll be Lab C.</i></font>

123
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,206
<font color="#b9de12">- Why not the main lab?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Magnetic shielding issues.</font>

124
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,177
<font color="#b9de12">I don't give a damn about shielding.</font>

125
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,680
<font color="#b9de12">I just don't want</font>
<font color="#b9de12">the mongrels watching this.</font>

126
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,716
<font color="#b9de12">That's how rumors get started.</font>

127
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,348
<font color="#b9de12">Power levels are ready.</font>

128
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,419
<font color="#b9de12">Distance to target would be</font>

129
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,152
<font color="#b9de12">thirty-six inches.</font>

130
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,119
<font color="#b9de12">- Everything's set.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- What did you tell them?</font>

131
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,598
<font color="#b9de12">That you wanted to</font>
<font color="#b9de12">run some tests yourselves.</font>

132
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,034
<font color="#b9de12">And no, they don't think it's ready yet.</font>

133
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,867
<font color="#b9de12">- But you did finish the...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes, Dad. It's ready.</font>

134
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,342
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah. Well, we'll see.</font>

135
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,350
<font color="#b9de12">Initiating pre-sequence.</font>

136
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
<font color="#b9de12">- Power to 80.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- 80.</font>

137
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,819
<font color="#b9de12">Initiating primary trigger.</font>

138
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,021
<font color="#b9de12">Now.</font>

139
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,648
<font color="#b9de12">The hole's diameter is two inches.</font>

140
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:03,829
<font color="#b9de12">Depth is 4.5 inches.</font>

141
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,725
<font color="#b9de12">4.5 inches?</font>

142
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,028
<font color="#b9de12">It's three inches more than...</font>

143
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,171
<font color="#b9de12">- We did it!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- We?</font>

144
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,191
<font color="#b9de12">- It doesn't seem very warm.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It's not supposed to be.</font>

145
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:38,728
<font color="#b9de12">It doesn't split. It separates the quarks,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">destabilizing the atom.</font>

146
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,790
<font color="#b9de12">But a destabilized atom...</font>

147
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,390
<font color="#b9de12">The quarks come together,</font>

148
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:47,201
<font color="#b9de12">held by gluon to create stable atoms</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and thus stable molecules.</font>

149
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,434
<font color="#b9de12">You see, what my father found was that</font>

150
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,877
<font color="#b9de12">by neutralizing the gluon he could</font>
<font color="#b9de12">create a concentrated particle beam.</font>

151
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,276
<font color="#b9de12">Where the hole is now, it didn't explode?</font>

152
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,843
<font color="#b9de12">It separated, Emily.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">It separated at the most basic level.</font>

153
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,950
<font color="#b9de12">The atoms ceased to bond.</font>

154
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,187
<font color="#b9de12">So it worked?</font>

155
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,058
<font color="#b9de12">- Three inches deeper than I expected.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- And we should be able to increase that.</font>

156
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,159
<font color="#b9de12">- Well, the client will be thrilled.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No, they won't be.</font>

157
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,736
<font color="#b9de12">And, as head of my security team,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I'll need you at the meeting.</font>

158
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,343
<font color="#b9de12">Brice, I'm sure that he knows</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that he couldn't have done this without you.</font>

159
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,583
<font color="#b9de12"><i>There are some shielding problems</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>with the power supply.</i></font>

160
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,890
<font color="#b9de12">You wanted this portable. We're gonna need</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to redesign some elements.</font>

161
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,793
<font color="#b9de12">We're 40% over budget in development</font>

162
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,934
<font color="#b9de12">and now you want us to go back,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">back to the drawing board?</font>

163
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,167
<font color="#b9de12">You'd be more unhappy if you took</font>
<font color="#b9de12">possession of something that doesn't work.</font>

164
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,937
<font color="#b9de12">Yes, but we expect results.</font>

165
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,478
<font color="#b9de12">We'll eat some of the overages ourselves.</font>

166
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,078
<font color="#b9de12">We'll talk again in a month.</font>

167
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,386
<font color="#b9de12">Dr. Billings, I think you need to understand</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that these people that I represent</font>

168
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,321
<font color="#b9de12">are very serious people.</font>

169
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,949
<font color="#b9de12">Look, I went to work for you guys</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to give you my absolute best.</font>

170
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,924
<font color="#b9de12">That's what I'm gonna do.</font>

171
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,491
<font color="#b9de12">Yes, you are. I'll be in touch.</font>

172
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,666
<font color="#b9de12">Brice. Take the prototype and hide it.</font>

173
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,978
<font color="#b9de12">Clean the computer as well.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You try and help some people...</font>

174
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,962
<font color="#b9de12">Emily didn't inform me</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you were coming down, sir.</font>

175
00:13:55,267 --> 00:14:00,466
<font color="#b9de12">Let's see.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Is Emily my boss? Or am I Emily's boss?</font>

176
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,604
<font color="#b9de12">Of course, sir.</font>

177
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,390
<font color="#b9de12">You're out of water again.</font>

178
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,110
<font color="#b9de12">I brought you your candy bar.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">It's one of one of your favorites. I'll...</font>

179
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,816
<font color="#b9de12">I'll just leave it here for you.</font>

180
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,516
<font color="#b9de12">Now I need you to do me a favor.</font>

181
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,793
<font color="#b9de12">I need you to watch this crate for me.</font>

182
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,196
<font color="#b9de12">It's very important.</font>

183
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,900
<font color="#b9de12">Can I count on you, Shawn?</font>

184
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,848
<font color="#b9de12">- Trouble?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It's gone. The crazy bastard.</font>

185
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:31,052
<font color="#b9de12">Hey. It's gone.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">And the computer's been wiped clean.</font>

186
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,262
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know. If you don't put together</font>
<font color="#b9de12">something tonight, we're screwed.</font>

187
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,935
<font color="#b9de12">- What did you find?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Nothing. Just Brice's entry.</font>

188
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,569
<font color="#b9de12">And I talked to the guard.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">He complained about Brice.</font>

189
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,473
<font color="#b9de12">I wouldn't worry about that. Take a look.</font>

190
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,106
<font color="#b9de12">- I don't see anything.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You see that?</font>

191
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,744
<font color="#b9de12">There's a record of something there.</font>

192
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,317
<font color="#b9de12">- I do see it. Somebody changed something.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Somebody on the inside.</font>

193
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,522
<font color="#b9de12">Well, I will find him.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I'll get my team right on it.</font>

194
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,463
<font color="#b9de12">In the meantime,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you'll bring in some outside help.</font>

195
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,001
<font color="#b9de12">- Sir, my security department...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Is compromised.</font>

196
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,068
<font color="#b9de12">Put them somewhere else.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You had a break-in at the Fort Worth plant.</font>

197
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,042
<font color="#b9de12">You get your people on that today.</font>

198
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
<font color="#b9de12">- Sir...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- I don't want them here.</font>

199
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,417
<font color="#b9de12">I've been watching you, Emily.</font>

200
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,954
<font color="#b9de12">There is only four people</font>
<font color="#b9de12">who know that this thing works.</font>

201
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,022
<font color="#b9de12">Well, I haven't said anything.</font>

202
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,393
<font color="#b9de12">I know. Keep it that way.</font>

203
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,029
<font color="#b9de12">Now, I'm gonna need</font>
<font color="#b9de12">some serious protection,</font>

204
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,129
<font color="#b9de12">more than your staff can handle.</font>

205
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,940
<font color="#b9de12">Get me that guy we gave the Malaysian</font>
<font color="#b9de12">operation to several years ago.</font>

206
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,170
<font color="#b9de12">He was good.</font>

207
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,243
<font color="#b9de12">What was his name?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Bash, Basher, something.</font>

208
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,679
<font color="#b9de12">- Vasher. With a <i>"V."</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, yeah, that's him.</font>

209
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,018
<font color="#b9de12">What do we tell him?</font>

210
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,520
<font color="#b9de12">That a stalker took a dump in my bed,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">left life-threatening notes.</font>

211
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,326
<font color="#b9de12">Hell, you can tell him I'm being chased</font>
<font color="#b9de12">by werewolves, I don't care.</font>

212
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,593
<font color="#b9de12">Okay.</font>

213
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,194
<font color="#b9de12">- I'll tell him to pack the wooden stakes.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Silver bullets.</font>

214
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,402
<font color="#b9de12">- Sir?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, it's silver bullets with werewolves.</font>

215
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,638
<font color="#b9de12">Right.</font>

216
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,847
<font color="#b9de12">Am I the only one that knows this shit?</font>

217
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,044
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah. He asked for you.</font>

218
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,717
<font color="#b9de12">No, not by me.</font>

219
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,013
<font color="#b9de12">I wouldn't say that.</font>

220
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,522
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- Well, let me think about it.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- Well, don't take too long.</i></font>

221
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,994
<font color="#b9de12"><i>You start tonight.</i></font>

222
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,129
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- Can you wire the first half today?</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- I'm sure accounting can do that.</i></font>

223
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,058
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Fine, I'll tell them.</i></font>

224
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,940
<font color="#b9de12">We move fast,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">we drop everybody who gets in the way.</font>

225
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,006
<font color="#b9de12">Except Billings, of course.</font>

226
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,372
<font color="#b9de12">- What about...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- That's not gonna be a problem.</font>

227
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,308
<font color="#b9de12">Questions?</font>

228
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,985
<font color="#b9de12">He's bringing in</font>
<font color="#b9de12">some private contractors as well.</font>

229
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,351
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, that's why we've got to move quick.</font>

230
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,653
<font color="#b9de12">The good news is</font>
<font color="#b9de12">they're having trouble paying some bills.</font>

231
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,188
<font color="#b9de12">Looks like I'm gonna need</font>
<font color="#b9de12">my Fed suit again.</font>

232
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,926
<font color="#b9de12">The Careington job is done. Over.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">It's time to move on.</font>

233
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,987
<font color="#b9de12">I'll file it under Mosul,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Houston and Santa Clarita.</font>

234
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,260
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, Santa Clarita was not my fault.</font>

235
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,970
<font color="#b9de12">Honey, could you go see if your mom</font>
<font color="#b9de12">needs your help in the kitchen?</font>

236
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,335
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, shortcake.</font>

237
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,140
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, it's bad. Real bad.</font>

238
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,841
<font color="#b9de12">I was hoping Careington</font>
<font color="#b9de12">would pay the balance.</font>

239
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,416
<font color="#b9de12">- They still might.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You don't have a family.</font>

240
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,915
<font color="#b9de12">You know, you're the best tactical guy</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I've ever seen.</font>

241
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:33,094
<font color="#b9de12">I mean, in that realm, you are the man,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">but nobody, nobody's great at everything.</font>

242
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,032
<font color="#b9de12">Nobody does everything A plus.</font>

243
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,163
<font color="#b9de12">- Let me handle the business.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No, that's my job.</font>

244
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,567
<font color="#b9de12">- So, let me help.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No.</font>

245
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,812
<font color="#b9de12">Emily called.</font>

246
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,882
<font color="#b9de12">- Emily Johanson? I thought...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>

247
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,781
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, she called anyway.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She has a job for us.</font>

248
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,052
<font color="#b9de12">- Wants us to do bodyguard work.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- That's not our style.</font>

249
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,956
<font color="#b9de12">That's what I told her, "No <i>thanks."</i></font>

250
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,996
<font color="#b9de12">She works over at Billings.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Billings Lab, right?</font>

251
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,190
<font color="#b9de12">- Yep.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- That billionaire guy?</font>

252
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,765
<font color="#b9de12">- Yep.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Does it pay a lot?</font>

253
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,104
<font color="#b9de12">What's the point?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We don't do bodyguard work.</font>

254
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,300
<font color="#b9de12">It pays a lot.</font>

255
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,512
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, Robert! Robert!</font>

256
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,348
<font color="#b9de12">Wait, wait. Hold, hold, hold.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You guys aren't going out now are you?</font>

257
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,412
<font color="#b9de12">We talked about this already.</font>

258
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,549
<font color="#b9de12">- You said it was okay.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No we didn't.</font>

259
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,593
<font color="#b9de12">You, me and Denise were supposed</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to all go out together.</font>

260
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,152
<font color="#b9de12">Look, I'll be back home later tonight.</font>

261
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,564
<font color="#b9de12">You said it was okay already.</font>

262
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,967
<font color="#b9de12">Thanks. Let's go, guys.</font>

263
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,130
<font color="#b9de12">Bodyguarding isn't one of your three rules.</font>

264
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,243
<font color="#b9de12">- Don't take a bullet...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- For a client.</font>

265
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,040
<font color="#b9de12">- Always...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Plan.</font>

266
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,981
<font color="#b9de12">And don't go against the U.S. government.</font>

267
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,153
<font color="#b9de12">You're right.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Bodyguarding isn't one of the three.</font>

268
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,887
<font color="#b9de12">Well.</font>

269
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,357
<font color="#b9de12">The time for planning isn't great,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">but the other two seem to fit.</font>

270
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,335
<font color="#b9de12">I've already sent Tave ahead.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Building maintenance.</font>

271
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,304
<font color="#b9de12">So we start tonight. They pay up front?</font>

272
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,976
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, <i>dinero,</i> dollars and cents.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Come on, brother, I need it.</font>

273
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,210
<font color="#b9de12">Two weeks. That's not gonna cut it.</font>

274
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,985
<font color="#b9de12">Are you in or not?</font>

275
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,329
<font color="#b9de12">Dig it.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">All right, I've got to collect a few things.</font>

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,894
<font color="#b9de12">I'll swing back by here in one hour.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Have Mabe meet us here then.</font>

277
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,264
<font color="#b9de12">- Thanks, Dad!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You're welcome.</font>

278
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,462
<font color="#b9de12">- Bye, Mr. Hatem!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Bye, Amanda.</font>

279
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,473
<font color="#b9de12">What's up with Mom?</font>

280
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,735
<font color="#b9de12">Go enjoy your friends, sweetie.</font>

281
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,636
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Agent Kilmer, FBI.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>I've got an offer you're gonna want to hear.</i></font>

282
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,964
<font color="#b9de12">Eugene. Here's yours, John.</font>

283
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,767
<font color="#b9de12">- And you must be Mabe.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah. Hi.</font>

284
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,105
<font color="#b9de12">Hi. Well, let me get you guys situated.</font>

285
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,875
<font color="#b9de12">Billings works until 9:00 most evenings</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and then heads home.</font>

286
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,007
<font color="#b9de12">Most of the employees leave at 5:00 to 5:30.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Monday's a holiday.</font>

287
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,983
<font color="#b9de12">Should be a real quiet night.</font>

288
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,543
<font color="#b9de12">We have a central room</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for security operations.</font>

289
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,818
<font color="#b9de12">Some parts of the facility</font>
<font color="#b9de12">are under pretty tight lock and key.</font>

290
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,018
<font color="#b9de12">Now, I will always cover Billings</font>
<font color="#b9de12">when he's moving.</font>

291
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,426
<font color="#b9de12">When he's not, I lead the first shift</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and you guys cover the other two.</font>

292
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,988
<font color="#b9de12">- You were once Secret Service, right?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes.</font>

293
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,190
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah.</font>

294
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,030
<font color="#b9de12">Does he stay in his office while he's here?</font>

295
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,003
<font color="#b9de12">Yes, usually.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">And when he's not, I will let you know.</font>

296
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
<font color="#b9de12">One will be in advance</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and the other behind.</font>

297
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,941
<font color="#b9de12">Now, this is the security operations.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I always have somebody here.</font>

298
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,573
<font color="#b9de12">They've been instructed</font>
<font color="#b9de12">on what they can provide you with.</font>

299
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,948
<font color="#b9de12">I'll need the building schematics</font>
<font color="#b9de12">as well as a floor plan of the Billings' house</font>

300
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,044
<font color="#b9de12">and the routes getting to and from.</font>

301
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,055
<font color="#b9de12">Absolutely. Judd can help you.</font>

302
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,449
<font color="#b9de12">Eugene?</font>

303
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,696
<font color="#b9de12">So, what kind of threat are we looking at?</font>

304
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,795
<font color="#b9de12">Nothing much.</font>

305
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,035
<font color="#b9de12">Billings is just spooked out</font>
<font color="#b9de12">by some threatening letters.</font>

306
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,638
<font color="#b9de12">You don't feel the need for extra protection?</font>

307
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,204
<font color="#b9de12">Well, that answers the question</font>
<font color="#b9de12">about the last time.</font>

308
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,472
<font color="#b9de12">Okay. I guess I deserve that.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I'm not good at that confrontation stuff.</font>

309
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,340
<font color="#b9de12">Bullshit, Vash!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You confront just fine when it suits you.</font>

310
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,777
<font color="#b9de12">I deserve to know why.</font>

311
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,417
<font color="#b9de12">I don't suppose it would help to say</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that I made a huge mistake,</font>

312
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,854
<font color="#b9de12">that I was selfish?</font>

313
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,858
<font color="#b9de12">No, no. It doesn't help.</font>

314
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,987
<font color="#b9de12">Not a bit.</font>

315
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,132
<font color="#b9de12">Can we start over?</font>

316
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,998
<font color="#b9de12">What, wipe the slate clean? A fresh start?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Make believe it didn't happen?</font>

317
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,201
<font color="#b9de12">Any of those happy clichés? Hell, no.</font>

318
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,337
<font color="#b9de12">You can pretend that the injury</font>
<font color="#b9de12">isn't there, but I still have the scars.</font>

319
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,875
<font color="#b9de12">All right. That's fair.</font>

320
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,985
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know how, but apparently</font>
<font color="#b9de12">we're gonna have to work together now.</font>

321
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,092
<font color="#b9de12">You do look great, Em.</font>

322
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,687
<font color="#b9de12">Mr. Vasher? Ted Billings.</font>

323
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,855
<font color="#b9de12">- Don't know if you remember me.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Of course I do, sir.</font>

324
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,195
<font color="#b9de12">This is my son, Brice.</font>

325
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:20,226
<font color="#b9de12">He's got an I.Q. higher than me</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and still stupid. Got that from his mother.</font>

326
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,405
<font color="#b9de12">Well, let's sit down.</font>

327
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,009
<font color="#b9de12">I know this is probably just a milk run</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for somebody like yourself.</font>

328
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,912
<font color="#b9de12">The truth is</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I think someone's coming after me.</font>

329
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,883
<font color="#b9de12">What do you base that on, sir, the threats?</font>

330
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,750
<font color="#b9de12">No. Somebody's got it out for me.</font>

331
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,985
<font color="#b9de12">I'm sure it's just some kind of harmless nut,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">but they can be the worst kind.</font>

332
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,922
<font color="#b9de12">Probably one of the union leeches</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that lost his job.</font>

333
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,795
<font color="#b9de12">"Each according to his abilities,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">each according to his <i>needs."</i></font>

334
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,493
<font color="#b9de12">You know who said that?</font>

335
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,127
<font color="#b9de12">- Abraham Lincoln?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No. Lenin.</font>

336
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,171
<font color="#b9de12">I thought he wrote,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">"lmagine all the <i>people..."</i></font>

337
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,509
<font color="#b9de12">Not that one, dumb shit.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">The first leader of the Soviet communists.</font>

338
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,717
<font color="#b9de12">Yes, sir. Do you have any specific</font>
<font color="#b9de12">union leech in mind? You have a name?</font>

339
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:10,152
<font color="#b9de12">What does it matter?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">They're all part of the same damn mafia.</font>

340
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,853
<font color="#b9de12">Just keep me safe for the next few weeks.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Can you do that?</font>

341
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,688
<font color="#b9de12">That's affirmative, sir.</font>

342
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,363
<font color="#b9de12">Mr. Billings, about this wire...</font>

343
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,662
<font color="#b9de12">Mr. Vasher, I don't do the accounting.</font>

344
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,967
<font color="#b9de12">That's why</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I have an accounting department.</font>

345
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,669
<font color="#b9de12">If you have a question for them,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">pick up the phone and call them.</font>

346
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,534
<font color="#b9de12">Anything else?</font>

347
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,079
<font color="#b9de12">- No, sir.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Real good.</font>

348
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,649
<font color="#b9de12">I'll be here till 10:00. Then I'm going home.</font>

349
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,618
<font color="#b9de12">- Why are you playing with him?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Why do you say that?</font>

350
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:51,628
<font color="#b9de12">You have a political science degree, Vash.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Abraham Lincoln.</font>

351
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,998
<font color="#b9de12">If somebody's really after him, he's done for.</font>

352
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,761
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah? And I thought you were the best.</font>

353
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,134
<font color="#b9de12">I am, as long as I have all the information.</font>

354
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,038
<font color="#b9de12">I'll call down to accounting for you.</font>

355
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,641
<font color="#b9de12">By the way, it's Karl Marx,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">not Vladimir Lenin.</font>

356
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,948

<font color="#b9de12">- Haskell.</font>

357
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,083
<font color="#b9de12">What the hell's Haskell?</font>

358
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,350
<font color="#b9de12">The old warehouse?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">There's no security there.</font>

359
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,091
<font color="#b9de12">Dad, sometimes the best hiding place</font>
<font color="#b9de12">is just right out in the open.</font>

360
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,492
<font color="#b9de12">Hell, no!</font>

361
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,432
<font color="#b9de12">What were you thinking? You go get it.</font>

362
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,900
<font color="#b9de12">No, never mind.</font>

363
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,207
<font color="#b9de12">I'll get it tonight</font>
<font color="#b9de12">after the conference call with Malaysia.</font>

364
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,270
<font color="#b9de12">Take it to the house.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You pick me up in the garage at 9:00 p.m.</font>

365
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,480
<font color="#b9de12">Hey! You taking your medication?</font>

366
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,015
<font color="#b9de12">I will put you back.</font>

367
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,659

<font color="#b9de12">for birth control.</font>

368
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,587
<font color="#b9de12">Brice.</font>

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,928
<font color="#b9de12">Milk run, huh?</font>

370
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,897
<font color="#b9de12">So, has... Hi.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Has anyone talked to you about the...</font>

371
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,878
<font color="#b9de12">- About what?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It's really more of an office legend.</font>

372
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,339
<font color="#b9de12">Legend?</font>

373
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,283
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, a couple of mysterious deaths,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">unexplained.</font>

374
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,217
<font color="#b9de12">But... Gotta run.</font>

375
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,296
<font color="#b9de12">You know, for such a high level of access,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">there sure are a lot of closed doors.</font>

376
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,631
<font color="#b9de12">Well, that's the thing about this place.</font>

377
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,193
<font color="#b9de12">Left hand doesn't know</font>
<font color="#b9de12">what the right arm is doing.</font>

378
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,295
<font color="#b9de12">Hand.</font>

379
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,833
<font color="#b9de12">Right hand, left hand.</font>

380
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,202
<font color="#b9de12">Never mind.</font>

381
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,473
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe, after you get this set up,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you can head on home.</font>

382
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,605
<font color="#b9de12">You've got first shift tomorrow.</font>

383
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,515
<font color="#b9de12">Meet at Billings at 6:00 a.m.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and relieve Hatem and myself.</font>

384
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,416
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know</font>
<font color="#b9de12">what the hell I'm doing with Tave yet.</font>

385
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,114
<font color="#b9de12">Copy that. All right, here's your PDA.</font>

386
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,417
<font color="#b9de12">It's got all the files on it</font>
<font color="#b9de12">from the Billings house.</font>

387
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,393
<font color="#b9de12">At least the latest that's on file</font>
<font color="#b9de12">with the Planning and Zoning Commission.</font>

388
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,193
<font color="#b9de12">All right, great. I'll leave this here.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I'll call Tave and have him come pick it up.</font>

389
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,358
<font color="#b9de12">All right.</font>

390
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,536
<font color="#b9de12">Listen, Judd. It is Judd, right?</font>

391
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,138
<font color="#b9de12">What's this about an "office legend"?</font>

392
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,408
<font color="#b9de12">Billings' son Brice</font>
<font color="#b9de12">mentioned something about it.</font>

393
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,606
<font color="#b9de12">He thinks something's wandering around</font>
<font color="#b9de12">killing people.</font>

394
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,416
<font color="#b9de12">Good.</font>

395
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,665
<font color="#b9de12">Shawn, did you</font>
<font color="#b9de12">take the motorcycle out again?</font>

396
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,358
<font color="#b9de12">- How are you?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Fine.</font>

397
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,252
<font color="#b9de12">It clears out pretty early around here,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">doesn't it?</font>

398
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,490
<font color="#b9de12">Yes ma'am.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">After 5:30, there's not many people left.</font>

399
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,294
<font color="#b9de12">I'll be back bright and early, that's for sure.</font>

400
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,227
<font color="#b9de12">Thank you, ma'am.</font>

401
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,892
<font color="#b9de12">Thanks.</font>

402
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,005
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, sorry, no I.D., no appointment.</font>

403
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,980
<font color="#b9de12">I'm just here to kidnap and torture Billings</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to get some information.</font>

404
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,409
<font color="#b9de12">I took care of the stairwell cameras.</font>

405
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,388
<font color="#b9de12">- The doors are locked from the inside.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Got it.</font>

406
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,760
<font color="#b9de12">Remember, when I give you the signal,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">kill the power.</font>

407
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,114
<font color="#b9de12">He's in the power room. Let's go.</font>

408
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,424
<font color="#b9de12">Some of these floors</font>
<font color="#b9de12">have very little security.</font>

409
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,527
<font color="#b9de12">We don't need it on every floor.</font>

410
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,669
<font color="#b9de12">I'll be walking the halls.</font>

411
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,775
<font color="#b9de12">Enjoy your trip.</font>

412
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,543
<font color="#b9de12">He's on a conference call right now</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that should be finishing up at any time.</font>

413
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,781
<font color="#b9de12">He also said something about</font>
<font color="#b9de12">running an errand on the way home.</font>

414
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,482
<font color="#b9de12">- Where?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- He hasn't mentioned it to me yet.</font>

415
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,482
<font color="#b9de12">You know, in the meantime,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I can cover Billings.</font>

416
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,256
<font color="#b9de12">So if you guys want to take a break,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">feel free.</font>

417
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,393
<font color="#b9de12">- A break?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>

418
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,526
<font color="#b9de12">There's an employee lounge one floor down</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and on the other side of the building.</font>

419
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,502
<font color="#b9de12">- It's really nice.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- A break.</font>

420
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,464
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, yeah. A break, Vash.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She said we could take a break.</font>

421
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,773
<font color="#b9de12">- I'm not hungry.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Vash, go take a break.</font>

422
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,646
<font color="#b9de12">You really dig this corporate stuff, huh?</font>

423
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,081
<font color="#b9de12">They say if you can win the rat race,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you get to call your own shots.</font>

424
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,518
<font color="#b9de12">I've heard that winning the rat race</font>
<font color="#b9de12">makes you number one rat.</font>

425
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,488
<font color="#b9de12">- Break time.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a break.</font>

426
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,149
<font color="#b9de12">Break time. Break time.</font>

427
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,940
<font color="#b9de12">That was harsh, Vash.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She was just trying to be nice.</font>

428
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,040
<font color="#b9de12">You know...</font>

429
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,630
<font color="#b9de12">Okay, kill the lights.</font>

430
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,899
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Killing the computers,</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>exterior and elevators.</i></font>

431
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,239
<font color="#b9de12">Killing the main now.</font>

432
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,517
<font color="#b9de12">Bob?</font>

433
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,988
<font color="#b9de12">- Great.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- What the hell was that?</font>

434
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,189
<font color="#b9de12">Tave, check power.</font>

435
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,069
<font color="#b9de12">- What's going on?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- I don't know.</font>

436
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,785
<font color="#b9de12">Shots fired.</font>

437
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,060
<font color="#b9de12"><i>What the hell was that?</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>What's going on out there? I lost the call!</i></font>

438
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,565
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Get that call back right now</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>and turn on the lights!</i></font>

439
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,038
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Turn on the damn lights!</i></font>

440
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,336
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Is anyone out there?</i></font>

441
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,794
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Get the phone and the lights back on.</i></font>

442
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,961
<font color="#b9de12">Sounds like he's okay.</font>

443
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,601
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, we've got to get him out of here.</font>

444
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,368
<font color="#b9de12">Emily, you'd better make damn sure</font>
<font color="#b9de12">it's safe up here.</font>

445
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,000
<font color="#b9de12">Let me check this out.</font>

446
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,900
<font color="#b9de12">John.</font>

447
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,215
<font color="#b9de12">Okay, regroup in the garage.</font>

448
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,620
<font color="#b9de12">Looks like the power's been turned off.</font>

449
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,957
<font color="#b9de12">Computers and elevators</font>
<font color="#b9de12">are still on-line though. Stand by.</font>

450
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,347
<font color="#b9de12">I've got a bad feeling about this.</font>

451
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,447
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, but why didn't they snatch Billings?</font>

452
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,328
<font color="#b9de12">Maybe they didn't want to tangle with us?</font>

453
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,857
<font color="#b9de12">How do you like me now, bitch?</font>

454
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,606
<font color="#b9de12">Power's gonna be out for a while.</font>

455
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:33,250
<font color="#b9de12">Tave, call Mabe and get her moving.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Truck, full kit. I don't like this stairwell.</font>

456
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,916
<font color="#b9de12">Well, the elevators might still be on.</font>

457
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,085
<font color="#b9de12">What about the stairwell</font>
<font color="#b9de12">on the other side of the building?</font>

458
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,150
<font color="#b9de12">Sir!</font>

459
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,654
<font color="#b9de12"><i>I'm not coming out until I know it's safe.</i></font>

460
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,927
<font color="#b9de12">I'm telling you, Emily,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">this is no pissed-off union worker.</font>

461
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,128
<font color="#b9de12">We've got one body in the stairwell,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">clean as a whistle.</font>

462
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,465
<font color="#b9de12">Sir, we need to get you out of here.</font>

463
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,666
<font color="#b9de12">All right, let's move.</font>

464
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,844
<font color="#b9de12">I'm in the parking garage. Move in.</font>

465
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,139
<font color="#b9de12">Elevators are still on.</font>

466
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,744
<font color="#b9de12">That's nice, but I still want to use</font>
<font color="#b9de12">the other stairwell.</font>

467
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,011
<font color="#b9de12">I don't wanna get stuck in a box.</font>

468
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,250
<font color="#b9de12">Sir, come on.</font>

469
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,250
<font color="#b9de12">That other stairwell</font>
<font color="#b9de12">will be around this way to the left.</font>

470
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,860
<font color="#b9de12">You remember that time</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you wore that little black dress</font>

471
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,419
<font color="#b9de12">- when we went to that restaurant on top of...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Vash, please.</font>

472
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,524
<font color="#b9de12">It was the last time</font>
<font color="#b9de12">we were on a dark floor together.</font>

473
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,972
<font color="#b9de12">We really had something, Em.</font>

474
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,973
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah. Yeah, we did.</font>

475
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,742
<font color="#b9de12">You know, you get to the point in your life</font>
<font color="#b9de12">when you can look back</font>

476
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,311
<font color="#b9de12">and see the biggest mistake you ever made.</font>

477
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,452
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, make war, not love.</font>

478
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,403
<font color="#b9de12">You almost got shot, son.</font>

479
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,281
<font color="#b9de12">- Get him out of here!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Mr. Billings.</font>

480
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,852
<font color="#b9de12">Our garage is closed right now.</font>

481
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,121
<font color="#b9de12">I got three, maybe four targets</font>
<font color="#b9de12">with automatics.</font>

482
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,413
<font color="#b9de12">Damn it.</font>

483
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,684
<font color="#b9de12">- Copy that.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Look, we've got to get him out of here.</font>

484
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,524
<font color="#b9de12">- Negative. Parking garage is O.B.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- What does that mean?</font>

485
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,894
<font color="#b9de12">The parking garage is hot, sir.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We cannot go down there right now.</font>

486
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,061
<font color="#b9de12">No, no, no. This is crazy.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We'll take the other stairwell.</font>

487
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,569
<font color="#b9de12">Look, we don't know what we're up against.</font>

488
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
<font color="#b9de12">We might walk into something</font>
<font color="#b9de12">we're not equipped to handle.</font>

489
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,207
<font color="#b9de12">Well, too late for that. Stairwell C.</font>

490
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,204
<font color="#b9de12">Tave. Sitrep, stairwell C.</font>

491
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,248
<font color="#b9de12">Negative. Leads to the same parking garage.</font>

492
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,976
<font color="#b9de12">Sir. Sir!</font>

493
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,384
<font color="#b9de12">You know,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">maybe we should all just stick together?</font>

494
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,942
<font color="#b9de12">Sure, why not?</font>

495
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,986
<font color="#b9de12">Miss, stay in there</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and keep the door shut, please.</font>

496
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,243
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, good. You're gonna make me do this.</font>

497
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,356
<font color="#b9de12">You okay?</font>

498
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,793
<font color="#b9de12">Sun Tzu says to pitch the battle</font>
<font color="#b9de12">on the field of your choice.</font>

499
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,192
<font color="#b9de12">All right, get the men,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">regroup down the road.</font>

500
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,464
<font color="#b9de12">Mr. Billings?</font>

501
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,059
<font color="#b9de12">Sir?</font>

502
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,499
<font color="#b9de12">Emily?</font>

503
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,904
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Well, whoever that was is gone now.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Situation?</i></font>

504
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,878
<font color="#b9de12">Tave did a firefight, then a lower stairwell.</font>

505
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:09,441
<font color="#b9de12">Billings bolted at the fourth floor offices,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Emily pursued and I'm trying to locate them.</font>

506
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,026
<font color="#b9de12">Parking garage is clear.</font>

507
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,074
<font color="#b9de12">Easy. What's going on? Who are you?</font>

508
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,844
<font color="#b9de12">That's exactly what I want to know.</font>

509
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:47,822
<font color="#b9de12">Brice Billings. My father told me</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to pull the limo around at 9:00.</font>

510
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,425
<font color="#b9de12">I'm already late, so...</font>

511
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:05,072
<font color="#b9de12">Call them all in. Billings will probably go</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to where he's keeping it.</font>

512
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,041
<font color="#b9de12">We'll take care of business there.</font>

513
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,412
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, we'll hear from the inside.</font>

514
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,850
<font color="#b9de12">Look, if you catch up to him,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you hold him till I get there, you got it?</font>

515
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,079
<font color="#b9de12">Right.</font>

516
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,857
<font color="#b9de12">- Hey, how's it going? You good?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, yeah, I'm good. How about you?</font>

517
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,826
<font color="#b9de12">- I've been better.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, you got it.</font>

518
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,920
<font color="#b9de12">- Rally point. Hold this position.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah, you got it.</font>

519
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,343
<font color="#b9de12">- Lose something?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- He ran away.</font>

520
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,539
<font color="#b9de12">That's what we should be doing.</font>

521
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,380
<font color="#b9de12">Not me, Vash. This is my job.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I've got to find him.</font>

522
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:52,010
<font color="#b9de12">Em, what's so important</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that people are willing to die here tonight?</font>

523
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,485
<font color="#b9de12">- Oh, you're bleeding.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>

524
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,893
<font color="#b9de12">Here, go take off your jacket and your shirt.</font>

525
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,429
<font color="#b9de12">What's going on?</font>

526
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,197
<font color="#b9de12">Next-generation weapons.</font>

527
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,640
<font color="#b9de12">For the Department of Defense?</font>

528
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:20,775
<font color="#b9de12">Let's just say Billings fulfills a niche market.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">He got in early and he knows what he wants.</font>

529
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,450
<font color="#b9de12">What market?</font>

530
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,148
<font color="#b9de12">When Black Ops needs technology,</font>

531
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,214
<font color="#b9de12">they can't just pop down to</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Electronics-R-Us for what they need.</font>

532
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,693
<font color="#b9de12">Wait a second.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">These are government Black Ops people?</font>

533
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,492
<font color="#b9de12">No, no.</font>

534
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,828
<font color="#b9de12">There might be other groups that want to</font>
<font color="#b9de12">get their hands on some of this technology.</font>

535
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,370
<font color="#b9de12">Other groups?</font>

536
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,270
<font color="#b9de12">Your shirt.</font>

537
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:59,277
<font color="#b9de12">So, you have a boyfriend now?</font>

538
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,421
<font color="#b9de12">Sorry.</font>

539
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,365
<font color="#b9de12">I never figured</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you'd stick out this corporate thing.</font>

540
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,059
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah? Why's that?</font>

541
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:16,029
<font color="#b9de12">- You were the most idealistic person I knew.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Young and stupid, you mean?</font>

542
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,607
<font color="#b9de12">I learned from you,</font>

543
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:22,372
<font color="#b9de12">if you don't have your own agenda,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you get sucked into somebody else's.</font>

544
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,710
<font color="#b9de12">Some people's agendas can be good.</font>

545
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,115
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah? Well, now who's the idealist?</font>

546
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,986
<font color="#b9de12">That's a very funny thought coming from</font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Mr.</i> "I'll Do Whatever I <i>Want."</i></font>

547
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,648
<font color="#b9de12">Well, maybe I've changed.</font>

548
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,661
<font color="#b9de12">Or, at the very least,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">in the process of changing.</font>

549
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,295
<font color="#b9de12">When you left me</font>

550
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,899
<font color="#b9de12">you left something behind.</font>

551
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,508
<font color="#b9de12">That didn't survive.</font>

552
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,396
<font color="#b9de12">I'm sorry.</font>

553
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,174
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, hey, John,</font>

554
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,546
<font color="#b9de12">we are down one "Over the Hill"</font>
<font color="#b9de12">40th birthday party balloon.</font>

555
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,284
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Copy that. Down one balloon.</i></font>

556
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,419
<font color="#b9de12">We need to find Billings.</font>

557
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,759
<font color="#b9de12">That shouldn't be too hard.</font>

558
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,191
<font color="#b9de12">Where would I hide</font>
<font color="#b9de12">if I were a narcissistic son of a bitch?</font>

559
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,394
<font color="#b9de12">Vash.</font>

560
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,664
<font color="#b9de12">I would look</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for the darkest corner of the room</font>

561
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,537
<font color="#b9de12">and try to find the darkest place there.</font>

562
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,879
<font color="#b9de12">Mr. Billings, the place is secure.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We can leave now.</font>

563
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,752
<font color="#b9de12">How can you be so sure?</font>

564
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,085
<font color="#b9de12">Hey. Mabe's moving.</font>

565
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,649
<font color="#b9de12">Coordinate with our route to his house.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Which route we taking?</font>

566
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,628
<font color="#b9de12">Just follow us.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You'll be told when you need to know.</font>

567
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,857
<font color="#b9de12">"Need to know" was about an hour ago.</font>

568
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,957
<font color="#b9de12">Em?</font>

569
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,299
<font color="#b9de12">Leave the cell phone at home</font>
<font color="#b9de12">next time, man.</font>

570
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,711
<font color="#b9de12">You need to level with me.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">What's really going on?</font>

571
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,342
<font color="#b9de12">Nothing. Billings is getting a bit antsy.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I don't want him to just go off again.</font>

572
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,650
<font color="#b9de12">Look, I don't think</font>
<font color="#b9de12">we're dealing with just one thing here.</font>

573
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,716
<font color="#b9de12">And one is professional.</font>

574
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,929
<font color="#b9de12">Is there any chance that</font>
<font color="#b9de12">this group is part of the U.S. government?</font>

575
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,055
<font color="#b9de12">No.</font>

576
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,201
<font color="#b9de12">Fair warning, if it is, we're out of here.</font>

577
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,706
<font color="#b9de12">Fine. Look, we'll take him to his house.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">It's a fort.</font>

578
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,009
<font color="#b9de12">What's going on?</font>

579
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,749
<font color="#b9de12">Well, it seems a pretty well-armed group</font>
<font color="#b9de12">is a little pissed at your dad.</font>

580
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:25,055
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, and there's that ninja wanna-be</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that attacked us upstairs.</font>

581
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,023
<font color="#b9de12">Someone attacked you?</font>

582
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,564
<font color="#b9de12">Cut the crap. What do you know?</font>

583
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,731
<font color="#b9de12">It's my brother.</font>

584
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,502
<font color="#b9de12">- Your brother?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes, my brother.</font>

585
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,172
<font color="#b9de12">He has a disease. Porphyria.</font>

586
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:49,007
<font color="#b9de12">Makes him insane,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">madness of King George, all that stuff.</font>

587
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,548
<font color="#b9de12">My father</font>

588
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,253
<font color="#b9de12">keeps him locked up.</font>

589
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:02,422
<font color="#b9de12">Your brother. Well, you better lock him up</font>
<font color="#b9de12">tighter before he gets himself killed.</font>

590
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,492
<font color="#b9de12">Or kills someone.</font>

591
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,166
<font color="#b9de12">What's up?</font>

592
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,206
<font color="#b9de12">So, she's telling you that this has</font>
<font color="#b9de12">nothing to do with Uncle Sam, right?</font>

593
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,272
<font color="#b9de12">That's what she's saying.</font>

594
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,181
<font color="#b9de12">I figure we should walk away on this one.</font>

595
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,121
<font color="#b9de12">Come on, man, don't play.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You got any proof?</font>

596
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,385
<font color="#b9de12">No.</font>

597
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,895
<font color="#b9de12">- It's just a feeling.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- I hear you.</font>

598
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,057
<font color="#b9de12">- Who was that?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Kilmer and his thugs.</font>

599
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,297
<font color="#b9de12">No, I mean that maniac</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that attacked us up there.</font>

600
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,695
<font color="#b9de12">How the hell would I know?</font>

601
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,204
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, Mabe, when we get to Billings' house,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I need you to run me a blood sample.</font>

602
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,577
<font color="#b9de12">Also, I need a report</font>
<font color="#b9de12">on a disease called porphyria.</font>

603
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,310
<font color="#b9de12">All right, thanks.</font>

604
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,971
<font color="#b9de12">What's up with you, man?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I've never seen you this nervous.</font>

605
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,846
<font color="#b9de12">We should walk, Vash.</font>

606
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:09,649
<font color="#b9de12">Those same headlights have been with us</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for a few miles. They're gaining.</font>

607
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,787
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, they probably were waiting for us</font>
<font color="#b9de12">right outside of Billings.</font>

608
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,307
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- We've got company.</font>

609
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,216
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Can you handle it?</i></font>

610
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,183
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, but it'd be nice to know</font>
<font color="#b9de12">where we're going.</font>

611
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:40,481
<font color="#b9de12">Not over the phone.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Just tell him to keep following.</font>

612
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,190
<font color="#b9de12">Can you just keep following?</font>

613
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,386
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Probably not.</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>You're not heading to his house are you?</i></font>

614
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,429
<font color="#b9de12">- Just do your best.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No, bullshit!</font>

615
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,591
<font color="#b9de12">Billings starts leveling with me,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">or all bets are off. We're gonna walk.</font>

616
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,031
<font color="#b9de12">We don't...</font>

617
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,696
<font color="#b9de12">You listen up.</font>

618
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:59,072
<font color="#b9de12">This is a terrorist group that wants</font>
<font color="#b9de12">a very serious piece of technology I have.</font>

619
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:03,201
<font color="#b9de12">I will not risk national security</font>
<font color="#b9de12">over an unsecured line.</font>

620
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,414
<font color="#b9de12">Just follow us and keep the bastards off me.</font>

621
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,548
<font color="#b9de12">John, don't scratch my car.</font>

622
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,919
<font color="#b9de12">- Want me to take care of them?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah. What are you waiting for?</font>

623
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,258
<font color="#b9de12">No, no, no! Don't! Don't!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">They might be government!</font>

624
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,797
<font color="#b9de12">Fine. Stand down.</font>

625
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:47,987
<font color="#b9de12">Left! Left!</font>

626
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,156
<font color="#b9de12">Go, man.</font>

627
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,129
<font color="#b9de12">Are you throwing this fight, John?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Are you throwing this fight?</font>

628
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,931
<font color="#b9de12">Up here. Up here.</font>

629
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,643
<font color="#b9de12">- I think they went this way.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No, they did not, Vash.</font>

630
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,537
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, who's driving here, me or you?</font>

631
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,986
<font color="#b9de12">You better hope they went this way.</font>

632
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,916
<font color="#b9de12">Tave! Tave, give me the phone!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Give me the phone back!</font>

633
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,565
<font color="#b9de12">She's not answering.</font>

634
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,007
<font color="#b9de12">John, you'd better tell me</font>
<font color="#b9de12">why you sandbagged us.</font>

635
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,349
<font color="#b9de12">What're you doing? Lose them!</font>

636
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:23,110
<font color="#b9de12">You took money, John. You sold us out.</font>

637
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,887
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, he came to my house.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">What was I supposed to do?</font>

638
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,059
<font color="#b9de12">- Why?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It wasn't gonna hurt us.</font>

639
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:37,527
<font color="#b9de12">No! No! Not good enough!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You're gonna tell me why!</font>

640
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,363
<font color="#b9de12">Maggie said she's leaving me.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She's taking my kids away from me, Vash.</font>

641
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,996
<font color="#b9de12">- What?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- My wife!</font>

642
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,572
<font color="#b9de12">She's walking out on me</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and she's taking my children away from me!</font>

643
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,305
<font color="#b9de12">I had to do something, Vash!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Nobody else is.</font>

644
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,677
<font color="#b9de12">How? How could you do this?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">How could you do this, John?</font>

645
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:57,310
<font color="#b9de12">Look, it's not just the Careington job.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">The Rodgers case. The Monterey job.</font>

646
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,713
<font color="#b9de12">- You son of a...</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Vash, enough!</font>

647
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,757
<font color="#b9de12">- Come on! Let it go!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You're a piece of shit, John!</font>

648
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,452
<font color="#b9de12">- Do you hear me? You're a piece of shit!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Come on!</font>

649
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,686
<font color="#b9de12">Get off me, Tave!</font>

650
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:14,301
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, you know, for you,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">this whole thing we do</font>

651
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,430
<font color="#b9de12">is a noble, noble, grand cause, Vash.</font>

652
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,998
<font color="#b9de12">But the rest of us, we have to pay bills!</font>

653
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,777
<font color="#b9de12">I have bills to pay.</font>

654
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,184
<font color="#b9de12">You don't cover my ass.</font>

655
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,927
<font color="#b9de12">You don't.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You'd leave me hanging out there.</font>

656
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,767
<font color="#b9de12">Come on.</font>

657
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,180
<font color="#b9de12">I'm telling you, Tave. I'm telling you, man.</font>

658
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,621
<font color="#b9de12">You know when we met each other</font>
<font color="#b9de12">in Desert Storm, we hated each other.</font>

659
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,857
<font color="#b9de12">Veteran sergeant</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and a green lieutenant, right?</font>

660
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,626
<font color="#b9de12">So we solved it the old-fashioned way.</font>

661
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,228
<font color="#b9de12">We took our discussion out behind</font>
<font color="#b9de12">this house that was there before Abraham.</font>

662
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,006
<font color="#b9de12">And it took everything that I had,</font>

663
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,909
<font color="#b9de12">but I finally made that asshole</font>
<font color="#b9de12">see it my way!</font>

664
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,219
<font color="#b9de12">You know, in the olden days,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you strike an officer, it meant death.</font>

665
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:44,389
<font color="#b9de12">But instead, that bastard saved my life</font>
<font color="#b9de12">three different times.</font>

666
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,327
<font color="#b9de12">And now this, man...</font>

667
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,832
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know what to...</font>

668
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,844
<font color="#b9de12">Come on.</font>

669
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,956
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe baby, get me an analysis on these.</font>

670
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,126
<font color="#b9de12">Sure.</font>

671
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:48,006
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Locator's a little weak. We need to move fast</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>before we lose the signal.</i></font>

672
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,316
<font color="#b9de12">- Well, the blood will prove it.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Prove what?</font>

673
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,724
<font color="#b9de12">She's not talking to you. Just drive.</font>

674
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,890
<font color="#b9de12">Porphyria.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">The blood doesn't produce enough heme.</font>

675
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,230
<font color="#b9de12">It causes all sorts of problems,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">including mental instability.</font>

676
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,669
<font color="#b9de12">Mental instability?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">What do you mean, like, insanity?</font>

677
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:10,931
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah.</font>

678
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:16,167
<font color="#b9de12">Yup, it looks like your friend</font>
<font color="#b9de12">from the Billings building has it.</font>

679
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,214
<font color="#b9de12">Sir, wouldn't we be safer at your house?</font>

680
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,453
<font color="#b9de12">That's where we'll go</font>
<font color="#b9de12">after we pick up the device.</font>

681
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,999
<font color="#b9de12">It's got a lot of normal elements.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">But there's some...</font>

682
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,200
<font color="#b9de12">There's some traces of chlordane</font>
<font color="#b9de12">in it as well.</font>

683
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:53,610
<font color="#b9de12">- Chlordane? What's that?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It's a pesticide.</font>

684
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,778
<font color="#b9de12">Hold on.</font>

685
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,953
<font color="#b9de12">Looks like it's a pesticide. Was discontinued</font>
<font color="#b9de12">by the U.S. government in 1976.</font>

686
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,756
<font color="#b9de12">Could a porphyria patient</font>
<font color="#b9de12">possibly use that as a treatment?</font>

687
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,821
<font color="#b9de12">No, I wouldn't think so.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I should think it'd make it worse.</font>

688
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:13,265
<font color="#b9de12">So, a factory, an old warehouse</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that manufactured it, that's the site.</font>

689
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,929
<font color="#b9de12">- That's where he could be staying.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It's possible, yeah.</font>

690
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,565
<font color="#b9de12">Tave, where's the locator taking us?</font>

691
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,406
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Towards the southeast part of town.</i></font>

692
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,002
<font color="#b9de12">Bingo. The industrial section.</font>

693
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,851
<font color="#b9de12">I think this porphyria guy</font>
<font color="#b9de12">hasn't given up on Billings.</font>

694
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,593
<font color="#b9de12">- I don't like this.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- We'll get the device and get out of here.</font>

695
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,799
<font color="#b9de12">Give me a hand.</font>

696
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,338
<font color="#b9de12">Brice, grab the other side.</font>

697
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,082
<font color="#b9de12">No, Shawn, I can do this myself.</font>

698
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,581
<font color="#b9de12">- Who are you talking to?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- My brother.</font>

699
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,988
<font color="#b9de12">- You don't have a brother.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yes, I do!</font>

700
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,360
<font color="#b9de12">- Brice, get this off of me.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Shut up!</font>

701
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,069
<font color="#b9de12">Don't do it!</font>

702
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,265
<font color="#b9de12">- Okay. It's just a cell phone.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Don't do it!</font>

703
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,067
<font color="#b9de12">- It's just a cell phone. Okay.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Put it down! Put it down!</font>

704
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,810
<font color="#b9de12">Put it down!</font>

705
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,245
<font color="#b9de12">Put it down!</font>

706
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,714
<font color="#b9de12">- Brice!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Shut up!</font>

707
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,578
<font color="#b9de12">- Come here. Come here.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Okay.</font>

708
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,315
<font color="#b9de12">You see, Shawn?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I told you I could have her.</font>

709
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:48,428
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, I'm on Highway 26</font>
<font color="#b9de12">moving toward the industrial section.</font>

710
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:49,725
<font color="#b9de12">Move in.</font>

711
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,533
<font color="#b9de12">I gotta take this.</font>

712
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,862
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah?</font>

713
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,775
<font color="#b9de12">The battery's already dying on this locator.</font>

714
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:07,674
<font color="#b9de12">The best I can do is this area here.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">It's maybe within a block or two.</font>

715
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,975
<font color="#b9de12">Okay, cross-reference that section</font>
<font color="#b9de12">for any of Billings' holdings.</font>

716
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,611
<font color="#b9de12">You know, I'm not getting this.</font>

717
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,418
<font color="#b9de12">Billings has another son who wants</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to get even for something?</font>

718
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,857
<font color="#b9de12">What does that have to do</font>
<font color="#b9de12">with Kilmer and his thugs?</font>

719
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,416
<font color="#b9de12">Maybe nothing.</font>

720
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,791
<font color="#b9de12">- Mabe, you got that file on Billings?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah. It's right here.</font>

721
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,368
<font color="#b9de12">It says here Billings only has one son.</font>

722
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:40,147
<font color="#b9de12">All right, I've got it. It's 1400 South Haskell.</font>

723
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,843
<font color="#b9de12">It's an old warehouse and factory.</font>

724
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,287
<font color="#b9de12">They used to make pesticides</font>
<font color="#b9de12">with chlordane.</font>

725
01:13:56,231 --> 01:14:01,032
<font color="#b9de12"><i>I've been noticing</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>the looks you've been giving me</i></font>

726
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:09,370
<font color="#b9de12">We'd make such a great team.</font>

727
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,979
<font color="#b9de12">You know what, Brice?</font>

728
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,711
<font color="#b9de12">You're right. I have been looking at you.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You don't need the gun.</font>

729
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,015
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, that's good.</font>

730
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,526
<font color="#b9de12">All right, here's the latest copies</font>
<font color="#b9de12">of the floor plan on file with the city.</font>

731
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,826
<font color="#b9de12">That's probably 20 years old.</font>

732
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,764
<font color="#b9de12">They're gonna be pissed</font>
<font color="#b9de12">you're not working for them anymore.</font>

733
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,869
<font color="#b9de12">They're gonna take back</font>
<font color="#b9de12">more than their money.</font>

734
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:48,873
<font color="#b9de12">Maggie's packing the kids up right now.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She won't even tell me where she's going.</font>

735
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,418
<font color="#b9de12">You know, man, I'm no marriage counselor,</font>

736
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,154
<font color="#b9de12">but it seems to me this relationship needs</font>
<font color="#b9de12">more than just a quick infusion of cash.</font>

737
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:02,163
<font color="#b9de12">You're right. You're no marriage counselor.</font>

738
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,300
<font color="#b9de12">Is it too late, bro?</font>

739
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,998
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know.</font>

740
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,175
<font color="#b9de12">Hey.</font>

741
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:23,376
<font color="#b9de12">I'm not giving you any reason</font>
<font color="#b9de12">to take other money ever again.</font>

742
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,353
<font color="#b9de12">We're almost there.</font>

743
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,589
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, copy.</font>

744
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,197
<font color="#b9de12">There's only one child.</font>

745
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:14,361
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know what Brice's been feeding you,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">but he has no brother.</font>

746
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,523
<font color="#b9de12">You want to stay here with Mabe</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and the truck?</font>

747
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,792
<font color="#b9de12">Hell, no.</font>

748
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,592
<font color="#b9de12">All right, then.</font>

749
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,402
<font color="#b9de12">Let's do this.</font>

750
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,633
<font color="#b9de12">- You like that?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Yeah.</font>

751
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,847
<font color="#b9de12">Brice!</font>

752
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,452
<font color="#b9de12">Vash.</font>

753
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,760
<font color="#b9de12">I'm sorry, Dad. Let me give you a hand.</font>

754
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,730
<font color="#b9de12">Shut up!</font>

755
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,103
<font color="#b9de12">Get off!</font>

756
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,904
<font color="#b9de12">- Oh! My leg!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- "Oh, my <i>leg."</i> Shut up!</font>

757
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,288
<font color="#b9de12">Comfy? Good.</font>

758
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,890
<font color="#b9de12">Come on.</font>

759
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:57,301
<font color="#b9de12">You don't know how to do this!</font>

760
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,099
<font color="#b9de12">What is my I. Q?</font>

761
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,973
<font color="#b9de12">- What is my I. Q?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- 182!</font>

762
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,339
<font color="#b9de12">One hundred and eighty-two!</font>

763
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:13,115
<font color="#b9de12">Do you really think</font>

764
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,881
<font color="#b9de12">you could have succeeded without me?</font>

765
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,451
<font color="#b9de12">I'm gonna wait here for Kilmer.</font>

766
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:48,956
<font color="#b9de12">You guys secure the perimeter.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Nothing leaves that building.</font>

767
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,822
<font color="#b9de12">You know what I learned, Dad?</font>

768
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,068
<font color="#b9de12">I learned that porphyria</font>

769
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,738
<font color="#b9de12">is treatable. Yeah.</font>

770
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,715
<font color="#b9de12">You can't cure it. No, no, no, no.</font>

771
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,150
<font color="#b9de12">But you can at least treat it!</font>

772
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,683
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, but you knew that, didn't you?</font>

773
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,195
<font color="#b9de12">- Please, Brice, no.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- You knew that</font>

774
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,059
<font color="#b9de12">and you still locked him away</font>
<font color="#b9de12">in the basement.</font>

775
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,865
<font color="#b9de12">- Son, you have no brother.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Look at him!</font>

776
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,903
<font color="#b9de12">God, Dad.</font>

777
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,302
<font color="#b9de12">All those years,</font>

778
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:46,137
<font color="#b9de12">locked away in a basement.</font>

779
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:52,179
<font color="#b9de12">You think that some food</font>
<font color="#b9de12">and some freaking board games is enough?</font>

780
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:56,517
<font color="#b9de12">I gave you everything you needed.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You were a difficult child to raise!</font>

781
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,719
<font color="#b9de12">Your son, Dad! Your son!</font>

782
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,126
<font color="#b9de12">You treated him</font>

783
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,400
<font color="#b9de12">like an animal.</font>

784
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,233
<font color="#b9de12">- Is there anyone else in there with him?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- I don't know.</font>

785
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:18,075
<font color="#b9de12">- Does he have any other weapons?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It all happened too quick, Vash.</font>

786
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,243
<font color="#b9de12">Tave, threats unknown.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Find out what you can.</font>

787
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,650
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Copy that.</i></font>

788
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,523
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe, you've got company. Lock it down.</font>

789

<font color="#b9de12"><i>Truck is going out.</i></font>

790
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,303
<font color="#b9de12">Vash, I see five on the street.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Our friends are back.</font>

791
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,306
<font color="#b9de12">Mabe, we've got two down at the truck.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">The other two are trying to flank.</font>

792
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:32,253
<font color="#b9de12">John, Mabe might have</font>
<font color="#b9de12">more than she can handle.</font>

793
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,866
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- Tave, anything inside?</i></font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Stand by.</font>

794
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,377
<font color="#b9de12">Just Billings.</font>

795

<font color="#b9de12">- Bye, bitch.</font>

796
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,019
<font color="#b9de12">I count four down, plus a second SUV.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Might have two more.</font>

797
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,262
<font color="#b9de12">You're lucky it didn't go through. Easy.</font>

798
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,860
<font color="#b9de12">- Easy.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- It feels like it did.</font>

799
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,027
<font color="#b9de12">Easy.</font>

800
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,702
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, Mabe took one.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">She got hit in the vest.</font>

801
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,935
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Get her back to the truck.</i></font>

802
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:06,207
<font color="#b9de12">Just give me a minute. I'll be fine.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, Christ, it stings like a bitch.</font>

803
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:09,016
<font color="#b9de12">When was your first job with us?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Remember?</font>

804
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,177
<font color="#b9de12">You remember your first job? Where was it?</font>

805
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:15,746
<font color="#b9de12">Oh, God. Cardiff, Wales.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You were there. You know.</font>

806
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:19,386
<font color="#b9de12">You didn't like me being there.</font>

807
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,624
<font color="#b9de12">You didn't like the idea</font>
<font color="#b9de12">of having an Irish girl on your team.</font>

808
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,664
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah. Can you blame me?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">All right, easy, easy.</font>

809
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,261
<font color="#b9de12">I mean, you Irish and all.</font>

810
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:34,135
<font color="#b9de12">You never lose your temper.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Just a little tough to get you riled up.</font>

811
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,437
<font color="#b9de12">- I know.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- All right.</font>

812
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,604
<font color="#b9de12">- All right.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Go back to the truck.</font>

813
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,547
<font color="#b9de12">- Lock yourself in.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- I want to stay here.</font>

815
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,349
<font color="#b9de12">Fine.</font>

816

<font color="#b9de12">Brice!</font>

817
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:55,952
<font color="#b9de12">Stop, please!</font>

818
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,836
<font color="#b9de12">I had no help. No choice.</font>

819

<font color="#b9de12">- Where is who?</font>

820
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:14,971
<font color="#b9de12">- You got a son nobody one knows about?</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- No, just Brice.</font>

821
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,118
<font color="#b9de12">He had a disease. I didn't know what to do.</font>

822
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,921
<font color="#b9de12">He'd have been laughed at</font>

<font color="#b9de12">I did it for him, not to him.</font>

824
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,995
<font color="#b9de12">I even gave him personal tutors.</font>

825
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,566
<font color="#b9de12">He's smart!</font>

826
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,830
<font color="#b9de12">I did good.</font>

827
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,529

<font color="#b9de12">You know, Vash,</font>

837
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,712
<font color="#b9de12">I never did get to answer your question</font>
<font color="#b9de12">about a boyfriend.</font>

<font color="#b9de12">- Let's go see if this thing works.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">- Sounds good.</font>

839
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,595
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, you're in pain. Come on.</font>

840
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,571

842
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:06,481
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, that's fair</font>
<font color="#b9de12">after you shot me three times.</font>

843
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:10,354
<font color="#b9de12">She shot you twice, he shot you once.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I haven't shot you yet.</font>

844
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:14,124
<font color="#b9de12">I was a political science major, asshole.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Not a math major.</font>

845
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,457
<font color="#b9de12">Sit down.</font>

846
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:19,459
<font color="#b9de12">I've got an FN 5.7 there.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">That's armor-piercing.</font>

847
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,399
<font color="#b9de12">You'd be dead</font>
<font color="#b9de12">if I would've capped your ass.</font>

848
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,369
<font color="#b9de12">You're gonna wish I was.</font>

849
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:31,369
<font color="#b9de12">You should have let your partner</font>
<font color="#b9de12">take my money.</font>

850
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,605
<font color="#b9de12">Then we would have been done</font>
<font color="#b9de12">with all of this.</font>

851
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,646
<font color="#b9de12">Is it too late to change my mind?</font>

852
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,649
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, I think it is.</font>

853
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,422
<font color="#b9de12">Well, all right, then.</font>

854
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,200
<font color="#b9de12">Never saw your agenda.</font>

855
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:59,065
<font color="#b9de12">That's fascinating,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">because you were the one that taught me</font>

856
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,007
<font color="#b9de12">in the personal agenda department, Vash.</font>

857
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,507
<font color="#b9de12">Emily, I was wrong.</font>

858
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:23,089
<font color="#b9de12">Vash. Did you ever think</font>
<font color="#b9de12">that the only way to be truly free</font>

859
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,064
<font color="#b9de12">is to die?</font>

860
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:06,138
<font color="#b9de12">Brice, my son. I'm so sorry.</font>

861
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:11,169
<font color="#b9de12">No, no.</font>

862
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,455
<font color="#b9de12">Emily.</font>

863
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:29,495
<font color="#b9de12">You got him.</font>

864
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,556
<font color="#b9de12">Armor-piercing.</font>

865
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:48,077
<font color="#b9de12">Tave! We've got a man down! Damn it, Vash.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You broke rule number one.</font>

866
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:51,446
<font color="#b9de12">I didn't take bullet for a client.</font>

867
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,351
<font color="#b9de12">John!</font>

868
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:31,485
<font color="#b9de12">I don't know who's the bigger monster.</font>

869
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,525
<font color="#b9de12">That freak</font>

870
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,759
<font color="#b9de12">or the one that created him.</font>

871
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,931
<font color="#b9de12">Why'd you do that?</font>

872
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:52,104
<font color="#b9de12">I'm okay. I'll be okay.</font>

873
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:57,982
<font color="#b9de12">John. Your family.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">You got to take care of your family.</font>

874
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,450
<font color="#b9de12">Robert's got to turn pro.</font>

875
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:06,223
<font color="#b9de12">Yeah, let him play, I know.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">I know. He's just a kid.</font>

876
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,818
<font color="#b9de12">You're right, I'm wrong.</font>

877
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:11,194
<font color="#b9de12">And Mr. Billings, about that wire transfer.</font>

878
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:15,827
<font color="#b9de12">Tave! Mabe! Get in here!</font>
<font color="#b9de12">We've got a man down!</font>

879
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:25,439
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, don't you go anywhere. Don't you go.</font>
<font color="#b9de12">Don't you go. Don't you go.</font>

880
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,504
<font color="#b9de12">Don't you go anywhere.</font>

881
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,812
<font color="#b9de12">Get down.</font>

882
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:05,412
<font color="#b9de12">We got five.</font>

883
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,990
<font color="#b9de12">- Don't get so cocky, you hack.</font>
<font color="#b9de12"><i>- Just trying to earn a paycheck.</i></font>

884
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,083
<font color="#b9de12">Hey, you got paid on the last job,</font>
<font color="#b9de12">didn't you?</font>

885
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,422
<font color="#b9de12"><i>Copy that.</i></font>
