1
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:16,578
Here we are
in beautiful Ibiza, Spain.

2
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,078
Beautiful sand.

3
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:20,578
Beautiful waves.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,976
My favorite shorts.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,009
And my favorite girl
who is about to get...

6
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,076
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,976
Hey!

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,777
Come on, give it to me.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,777
No! Stop! Come on!

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,076
Mitch!

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,076
This is great!

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:35,576
I'm serious.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,344
Oh. Oh, my God.
That is so cute.

14
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,875
Honey, this is like...

15
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,442
Let me film
for just a couple minutes.

16
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,608
It's like
we're honeymooners.

17
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,608
Oh, my God!

18
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:46,409
♪ Honeymooners ♪

19
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,475
"Honeymoon"?

20
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,475
Yeah.

21
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:49,941
We're not married.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Katrina Harper...

23
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,341
You're my best friend
in the whole world.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,406
Oh, my God. Babe, stop it.
You're gonna make me...

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,139
If you get emotional,
you're gonna kill me.

26
00:01:09,173 --> 00:01:11,473
I'm trying to
get through this, babe.

27
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,639
I love you,
more than anything.

28
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:17,806
Will you marry me?

29
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:21,104
Oh, my God!

30
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,839
Yes!

31
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,839
Yeah?

32
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,405
Yes, Mitch Rapp.

33
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:25,705
I'll marry you.

34
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,805
Sorry, it's hard one-handed.

35
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,904
You like it?
It was my mom's ring.

36
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:37,704
I love it.

37
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,003
I love you.

38
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,103
I'm still...

39
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,103
Are you filming?
Oh, my God!

40
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,869
Yeah, I'm still recording.
I'm trying to get this.

41
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,635
Come on, Mitch!

42
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,369
This is why I was filming now.
You see, now you get it.

43
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:57,468
Smile.

44
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,401
I'm gonna get drinks.

45
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:04,467
Okay.

46
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:04,467
Yeah?

47
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:05,532
Don't be too long.

48
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,767
I won't, I won't.

49
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:07,867
I love you.

50
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:08,934
I love you.

51
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,966
I'll be back.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,399
Engagement drinks
in the water, people.

53
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,500
Whoo-hoo!

54
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:22,733
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

55
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,899
Very sweet, thanks.
Babe, we're getting applause.

56
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,732
I love you.

57
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:29,998
Thank you.

58
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,397
Hola. Como estas?

59
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,697
What can I get you?

60
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,862
Um, can I just get
two drinks, please?

61
00:02:47,897 --> 00:02:49,963
Dos bebidas,
if that's right...

62
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:51,664
Um, I just got engaged,
so something special.

63
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:52,796
It can be anything, though.

64
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,062
Oh, you lucky guy.

65
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,527
Oh, can they be kinda
strong too? Is that cool?

66
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,430
Thank you, man.

67
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,128
Oh, whoa.
Maybe not that strong.

68
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,526
Katrina!

69
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:49,924
Katrina!

70
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:03,856
Katrina?

71
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:07,623
Katrina!

72
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,755
Mitch!

73
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,655
Mitch!

74
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:19,588
Mitch!

75
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:20,688
Mitch!

76
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,422
Katrina!

77
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,443
We're gonna
fucking set your shit
on fire, man!

78
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:25,543
Fuckin' burn,
motherfucker, burn!

79
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:27,344
To our brothers
across the globe...

80
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:30,743
Come join our fight
against American imperialism.

81
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:33,608
They will pay for the murder
of our families,

82
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:37,608
our friends,
and all children.

83
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,975
Hold it,
hold it, hold it.

84
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:47,469
All right, stop!
Come on, man!

85
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

86
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:54,901
Let him go, let him go.
Let him go, let him go!

87
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,568
Break it up. Let him go!

88
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,734
What the fuck
is your deal, man?

89
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:01,368
That's it.
You're done, Rapp. Get out.

90
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,967
He keeps doing this shit.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,999
Get out!

92
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:09,434
Have a nice
fucking day.

93
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,766
You were out of line.

94
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,733
Back to work.
Keep moving.

95
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:04,094
Get outta there!

96
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,461
You're gonna get
yourself killed,
you dumbass!

97
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:06,062
What's up
with this guy?

98
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,027
Fuck!

99
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:45,524
Rapp, why I gotta
tell you again?

100
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:47,623
Sorry, Mr. Nazir.
I didn't realize
it was past 10:00.

101
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:48,824
I'll try to keep it down.

102
00:09:48,857 --> 00:09:50,356
Yeah, enough with
the sports.

103
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,557
Copy that. All right.
Thanks, Mr. Nazir.

104
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,288
He's up again.

105
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:14,977
Assalam-alaikum.

106
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,277
Walaikum-assalam.

107
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,433
Why have you come?

108
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,267
To help Adnan al-Mansur
achieve his people's destiny.

109
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:15,998
Inshallah.

110
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:21,032
I wanted to look
in your eyes.

111
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:23,531
I don't trust you.

112
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:25,266
I'm prepared to die a martyr.

113
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,031
What can I do
to earn your trust?

114
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,893
No!

115
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,992
Step away, now!

116
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,293
Come on!

117
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,525
The fuck off me!

118
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,825
He's dead, it's over.

119
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,958
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.

120
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,558
Area's secure.

121
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:40,057
You wanted
to kill them all,
and then go on killing.

122
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:42,424
Pretty extreme,
don't you think?

123
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,890
No, I don't think
that's extreme at all.

124
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,624
I think people like that
deserve to die

125
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,757
in the worst ways
you can imagine.

126
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,822
What do you remember
about your parents' death?

127
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,922
Car crash.

128
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,356
I was in Massachusetts.

129
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,888
They were in Tunisia
at the time.

130
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,422
I was 14.

131
00:15:58,556 --> 00:15:59,822
That's what I remember.

132
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,054
You started having
discipline problems.

133
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,355
Got yourself kicked out of
three boarding schools.

134
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:09,287
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I wonder
what that was about.

135
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:12,554
Let's talk
about what happened
after that day on the beach.

136
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Again? Are you kidding me?

137
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,586
Yeah, again.

138
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:22,653
You gave up everything
after that, didn't you?

139
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,819
Your grad studies
at Brown University.

140
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,653
I must have
lost interest.

141
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,653
In everything?

142
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,454
No, not everything.

143
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,318
See you later,
Dr. Frain.

144
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:48,619
See you tomorrow,
same time?

145
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:54,651
I like the new look.

146
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,916
Irene Kennedy,
CIA Deputy Director

147
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,417
in charge
of Counterterrorism.

148
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,883
I know who you are.

149
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,650
Any idea how long
you been here?

150
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,049
30 days.

151
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,750
Enough time for you
to figure out
a couple things.

152
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,316
Yeah, yeah. I've figured out
a lot about myself.

153
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,382
It's been
a very reflective time.
Thank you.

154
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:21,814
You wouldn't have made it
through the next 20 seconds
there alive.

155
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,515
I guess we'll never
know now, will we?

156
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,913
You told Dr. Frain
you thought you were
gonna kill Mansur

157
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,614
and wipe out his whole cell.

158
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,847
For starters.

159
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,648
Mmm-hmm.

160
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:35,314
You had
an even bigger agenda,
didn't you, Mitch?

161
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,313
What did you think,

162
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,813
you were gonna jump
from cell to cell
taking out terrorists?

163
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,280
Righting the world's wrongs?

164
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:42,946
Got to Mansur, didn't I?

165
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,380
I mean, it's more
than you accomplished.

166
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:47,512
I'm gonna let you in
on something.

167
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:50,379
Our people here,
they don't know
what to do with you.

168
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,812
A lot of them think we should
just throw you in a supermax.

169
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,678
Me?

170
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:57,845
I like your agenda, Mitch.

171
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:01,543
I can help you with it,
if you throw in with us.

172
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:03,510
We can teach you
how to play
with the big boys.

173
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,377
Yeah, let me
stop you right there.

174
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:08,011
You don't think I considered
that 18 months ago?

175
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,677
Joining the CIA?

176
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,475
I made the decision to
pursue Mansur on my own

177
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,576
'cause I knew
I could get it done.

178
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,743
What you need to understand
is that I'm the only way.

179
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,442
To get what you want.

180
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,808
Why the hell
would I trust you?

181
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,643
Because I believe in you.

182
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,375
And I'm all you've got.

183
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,508
What's been confirmed is

184
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,041
the enriched plutonium
has been stolen

185
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,973
from a decommissioned
Russian nuclear facility.

186
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,040
If they get their hands
on a nuclear trigger

187
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:42,841
and a physicist to build it,

188
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:45,407
they'd be able to arm it
and detonate it at any time.

189
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:47,907
Tom?

190
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,938
He's testing
through the roof.

191
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,038
Might be the best
I've ever seen.

192
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:03,372
We've had him
under surveillance
for six months.

193
00:19:03,406 --> 00:19:04,872
Martial arts,
gun skills.

194
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,904
I've surveilled dozens
of these vigilantes.

195
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,305
This one is different.

196
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,038
Yeah, well, I've gone
over these, Irene.

197
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:13,371
He's noncompliant,
he's oppositional.

198
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,371
He got us
into Mansur's cell.

199
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,370
That's a hell of a lot more
than we ever managed.

200
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:18,636
All right,
Orion is an elite unit, Irene.

201
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,004
A secret unit.

202
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:22,637
Reports to you, me,
and no one else.

203
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,802
I don't want
to be responsible

204
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:25,270
for that kind of mistake.

205
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:26,737
Now, that's Hurley talking.

206
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,701
Yeah, well, he's called me
twice about this.

207
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:31,669
This kind of psych profile
scares the hell out of him.

208
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,503
As far as he's concerned,

209
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,502
you're sending him
a Section 8
with an ax to grind.

210
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:37,368
What happened to that kid
on the beach,

211
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,735
it changed him.

212
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:40,569
You can't train that
into someone.

213
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:43,434
His psych profile is exactly
what I've been looking for.

214
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,034
Polygraph?

215
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,301
Flying colors.

216
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,601
All right.
Good luck with Hurley.

217
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, Irene.

218
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,466
We'll have fresh intel
on the Russian

219
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,300
plutonium situation
in two hours.

220
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,766
Stay by your phone.

221
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,799
Yeah.

222
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:16,264
You can take
the blindfold off.

223
00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:26,631
So, what do I need to know
about this guy?

224
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:27,796
Stan Hurley.

225
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,896
He's a warrior.

226
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,497
Ex-Navy SEAL.

227
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,630
My daddy served with him
in the Persian Gulf.

228
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,828
Did you go through
this program?

229
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,828
I went through
a program. Not this one.

230
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,860
It's not like becoming
a spy or Special Ops,

231
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,228
none of those things.

232
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,860
Good.

233
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,559
So, what are
your goals, Mitch?

234
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:27,325
My goals?

235
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:28,992
My goal is to have them
lie awake at night,

236
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,491
knowing I'm coming for them.

237
00:22:00,722 --> 00:22:02,922
I thought you were supposed
to be on the patch.

238
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,021
You saw those tests.

239
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,021
Yeah, I saw them.

240
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,522
He's off the charts.

241
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,621
I've seen
off the charts before.

242
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:14,287
And he's got
none of the bad habits

243
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,321
he'd have to unlearn
if he had military training.

244
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,586
Unlearn?

245
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,453
Come on, Stan.

246
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,319
You drop one of
your Navy SEALs
in an urban setting,

247
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:24,586
you can spot the boot camp
on them a mile away.

248
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:25,619
We're not fighting the...

249
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,286
Cold War? Yeah, I know.

250
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,786
You keep telling me that,
Miss Deputy Director.

251
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:32,519
Oh, wow.
"Miss Deputy Director."

252
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,352
Your daddy
would agree with me.

253
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:37,886
I'll be checking in with you
every 48 hours.

254
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:43,417
I'm on a plane to London
in the morning.

255
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,484
And go back on the patch,
for God's sake.

256
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:50,616
Don't prove me wrong.

257
00:22:58,716 --> 00:22:59,916
She ain't coming back.

258
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,249
Hey.

259
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:07,516
Eyes front and center.

260
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:09,748
Sorry.

261
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:11,848
"Sorry"? Do I look like one of
your college professors?

262
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:13,782
You talk to me,
you call me "sir," son.

263
00:23:14,615 --> 00:23:15,748
Yes, sir.

264
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,714
What the fuck
you doing here?

265
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,614
Did you have
some bad things
happen to you,

266
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:28,614
some shitty things
happen to you?

267
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:31,579
Now you wanna kill
those mean old terrorists.

268
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:32,713
Go get some bad guys.

269
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,579
What makes you think
you can make it

270
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,813
through my selection process?

271
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,512
Permission to speak, sir?

272
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,379
Sure, go ahead
if you got something
to say.

273
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:41,312
Like this is all
a big mistake
and you wanna go home.

274
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:42,778
You wanna go home? Good.

275
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:43,812
Get the fuck out of here.
I'll drive you myself.

276
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:45,711
Not at all, sir.

277
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:46,779
I was gonna suggest
we maybe speed
this whole thing up?

278
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,812
My guess is,
if you and I go hand-to-hand,

279
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,612
you could probably figure out
inside of 20 seconds

280
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:52,943
whether or not I have
what it takes to make it

281
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,478
through your
selection process.

282
00:23:55,444 --> 00:23:56,744
So, what do you think?

283
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,977
We got an empty cot,
empty footlocker.

284
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,809
They're both yours
as long as you can last.

285
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:12,710
Sounds good.

286
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,475
Follow me.

287
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:16,742
See you out there.

288
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,009
Heard a lot about you,
by the way.

289
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,676
Excited to see
what you got.

290
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:34,707
Kill me.

291
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,873
People think you can slice
a man's throat like this.

292
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:46,273
That's only in the movies.

293
00:24:46,306 --> 00:24:47,738
Right there.

294
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,638
Do it.

295
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:51,906
No noise. No mess.

296
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:01,239
Victor, you're up.

297
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:16,270
What the fuck, man?

298
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:18,237
Who grabs a fucking blade?

299
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,335
Come on, you fuckin' pussy.
Let's go!

300
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:48,267
You gotta have eyes
in the back of your head.

301
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,966
You flinch, you die.

302
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,733
Orion is about the mission.

303
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,899
It ain't about you.

304
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,564
You go down out there,
you're a ghost,
you don't exist.

305
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:11,898
There's nobody,
nobody coming back for you.

306
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,965
You're about to be captured.

307
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:24,964
Bye-bye.

308
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,796
We now know
15 kilos of plutonium-239

309
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,662
went missing
during the Russian breach.

310
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,729
It's enough to build
a full-scale nuclear weapon.

311
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:43,861
But that would likely
require the resources
of a nation-state.

312
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,728
As Iranian Chief
of General Staff,

313
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,694
I share your concern.

314
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:50,660
We have been monitoring
the situation as you have.

315
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,694
I'm afraid
we too are in the dark.

316
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,727
For Iran, of course,

317
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:57,794
a nuclear weapon
is off the table.

318
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:00,428
We have a treaty.

319
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:03,794
You have countrymen who are
not too happy about that.

320
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:07,392
We monitor your
nuclear enrichment program
pretty closely,

321
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,226
but black market
plutonium-239 from Russia...

322
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,960
Would be difficult
for inspectors to detect.

323
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,593
Ms. Kennedy, yes?

324
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:17,458
Mmm-hmm.

325
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:21,224
I assure you
as Minister of Defense

326
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:26,458
that we in Iran
recognize how much
the spirit of comity

327
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:29,924
between our nations
would be compromised

328
00:27:29,957 --> 00:27:31,823
if we were to acquire

329
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:33,990
weapons-grade plutonium
from any source.

330
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:36,591
Yes, it would.

331
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:39,257
Same goes for
your clients outside Iran,

332
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,823
Hezbollah. Hamas.

333
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:43,623
The Houthis.

334
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:47,455
Nuclear weapons are a danger
in any hands, Director.

335
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,422
Wasn't that your pretext
for your invasion

336
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:50,989
of our neighbor to the west?

337
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,522
One that cost
500,000 Iraqi lives

338
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:54,889
and left
a wake of destruction

339
00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,821
from which our region
has never recovered.

340
00:27:56,855 --> 00:28:00,322
General Rostami, we came only
to tell you what we know.

341
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,755
Is that a threat?

342
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:08,654
Of course not,
Minister Behruz.

343
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,387
Gentlemen,
I very much appreciate
you meeting with us.

344
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,853
Not at all.

345
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,319
I only wish we could
offer more insight.

346
00:28:15,354 --> 00:28:16,353
Thank you.

347
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:30,818
I don't trust
General Rostami.

348
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,586
We need to keep this quiet.

349
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:35,652
How ready is Orion?

350
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:38,585
I'll check in with Hurley.

351
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:43,984
Why is there
no one on watch?

352
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,716
You're all dead.

353
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,950
Yeah, yeah.
I got it, I got it.

354
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:52,949
You're dead.

355
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,317
What?

356
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,282
You wanna say something
to me? Say it.
Go on, say it.

357
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:03,616
You got 30 seconds!

358
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,348
These are your targets.

359
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,280
Memorize them.

360
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:17,814
It's your responsibility
to be able to identify them.

361
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,680
You shoot a combatant,
you get a point.

362
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:22,713
You miss, you get a shock.

363
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:25,680
You shoot a noncombatant,
you get a bigger shock.

364
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:28,214
Combatant shoots you...

365
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:29,713
Let's just say
you're gonna feel it.

366
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:31,746
Ready?

367
00:29:34,412 --> 00:29:35,412
Go.

368
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:16,842
What's Hurley doing?

369
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,842
He's fucking
with his head.

370
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,836
Fuck!

371
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,504
Fucking AR bullshit.

372
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:35,401
Shall we?

373
00:31:36,235 --> 00:31:37,367
Okay.

374
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:38,868
That's clever.

375
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,434
Raw plutonium.

376
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,967
Highly enriched,
as promised.

377
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,566
Let's hope.

378
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:57,167
Wow,
that's a beautiful sound,
gentlemen.

379
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,299
May I?

380
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,866
Okay.

381
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:04,499
Wire the money.

382
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:05,932
That, I can do.

383
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:09,865
This is a cell phone.

384
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:29,496
Okay.

385
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,690
It now appears
that all seven victims

386
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:19,358
were shot with
a single weapon,

387
00:33:19,391 --> 00:33:21,324
believed to be a Glock 29.

388
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:22,824
Traces of
weaponized plutonium

389
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:24,391
were detected
inside the van

390
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,958
where the bodies
of three Russians

391
00:33:25,991 --> 00:33:28,424
and two Warsaw
police officers were found.

392
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:30,456
The Russian government
has confirmed

393
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,290
that the chemical footprint
of the plutonium
in question

394
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:35,290
is a match to the plutonium
that was stolen

395
00:33:35,324 --> 00:33:36,557
from the decommissioned

396
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,688
processing facility
in Tobolsk.

397
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:41,689
Security footage is being
analyzed by Polish police,

398
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,855
now working in
conjunction with Interpol,

399
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,922
to identify the shooter
and his connection

400
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:47,622
to the missing plutonium.

401
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,688
The identity of the shooter
remains unknown...

402
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:23,685
Hi, excuse me.

403
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,186
How can I help you?

404
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,186
Question.

405
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,613
May I help you?

406
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:15,780
No, thanks.
I'm okay.

407
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:38,678
Ow! Ow! Ow!

408
00:35:36,712 --> 00:35:38,678
Hey! Hey! Hey!

409
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:40,179
Rapp! God damn it!

410
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:41,278
You have to
stay under control.

411
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:42,511
Dickhead!

412
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,178
Asshole doesn't know
when to quit.

413
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:46,178
You're kidding me, right?
I just saved your ass.

414
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,443
You've gotta know when
the mission's been
accomplished, Rapp.

415
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:48,944
Sir, he's a fucking...

416
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:48,944
Which he did.

417
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:52,277
Never assume your target
is the only target.

418
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:54,277
The enemy dresses
like a deer
and he kills like a lion.

419
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:55,477
And that's what
we gotta do.

420
00:35:58,443 --> 00:35:59,910
We just gotta
do it better.

421
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,542
All right.

422
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:05,175
You're an asshole.

423
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:23,740
We got a problem.

424
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,307
Six weeks ago,
there was a breach

425
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:27,508
at a decommissioned
Russian plutonium facility.

426
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,640
I'm aware.

427
00:36:30,674 --> 00:36:33,274
What you don't know
is 15 kilos of plutonium
went missing.

428
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:34,739
Weapons-grade.

429
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,672
That's a shit-ton
of plutonium.

430
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:37,906
And it just changed hands.

431
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:43,905
I wanna show you something.

432
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,173
Take a look at this.

433
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,604
Does that face
bong a gong for you?

434
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:52,172
Or is it just me?

435
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,937
It can't be him.

436
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,471
Our drones took him out
after the embassy bombing
at Bamako.

437
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:04,370
We never got
a positive ID.

438
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,403
That's our mad dog
out there.

439
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,669
All right.
Let's say it's him.

440
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:14,403
It's him, Irene.

441
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,769
This gives us a chance
to kill two birds
with one stone.

442
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,267
Hamdi Sharif.

443
00:37:21,302 --> 00:37:23,801
He's an arms dealer
working out of Turkey.

444
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:26,668
Four days ago, he purchased
a Russian-designed
nuclear trigger.

445
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,634
And he's gonna be selling it.

446
00:37:28,668 --> 00:37:30,267
Sharif's got
the honey.

447
00:37:30,302 --> 00:37:32,501
Now we just wait
for the bee.

448
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:34,701
We go in,
we fuck up their deal.

449
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:38,867
And we take 'em both out.

450
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,199
You're going to Istanbul.

451
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,399
We have an agent in place.

452
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,566
She'll meet you
at the airport.

453
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,333
All right.

454
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,666
Annika Ogden. We've had her
on the ground over there

455
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:53,797
for five years.

456
00:37:53,832 --> 00:37:55,266
I want Rapp on the team.

457
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:57,532
Really?

458
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,732
He's ready, Stan.

459
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:01,164
Actually, Irene,
he's not ready.

460
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,497
But he will be.

461
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,497
You wanted to see me, sir?

462
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,530
Yeah. Shut the door.

463
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,164
We're shipping out.

464
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:19,396
Set those down there.

465
00:38:21,796 --> 00:38:22,796
You like movies?

466
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:24,662
Sure.

467
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,530
I got something
for you.

468
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:29,662
What the fuck is this?

469
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:31,396
Yeah, I thought so.

470
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,729
You thought so?

471
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:33,729
Yeah.

472
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:35,795
Why are you
even alive, Rapp?

473
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:39,429
You ever
asked yourself that?

474
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:44,660
Why you? You know,
of all those people?

475
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,361
You're special, I guess.

476
00:38:46,394 --> 00:38:47,560
Oh, my God!

477
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:49,926
You want me to turn it up?

478
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,893
I'll marry you!

479
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,893
Take it!

480
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:54,926
You're a fucking coward,
you know that?
Turn that shit off.

481
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,926
What do you think?
It's my mom's ring.

482
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,560
You gonna turn it off?

483
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,893
Katrina!

484
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,593
Am I supposed to
feel sorry for you?

485
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:08,525
I don't.

486
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:23,391
You made a big mistake.

487
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:25,524
You let emotion
cloud your judgment.

488
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:30,890
Never, ever
let it get personal.

489
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:32,357
You understand?

490
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,155
Yeah, I got it.

491
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:50,621
Be ready to go by 5:00.

492
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,888
See you at 4:30.

493
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:03,154
You know what
you're gonna do here?

494
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:05,218
No, sir.

495
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:05,218
Correct. You don't.

496
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,720
So keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

497
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:07,785
And wait for my orders.

498
00:40:38,517 --> 00:40:42,783
Hamdi Sharif, a real-estate
mogul/arms dealer.

499
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,117
He's like Santa Claus
for terrorists.

500
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,483
Scumbag.

501
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:49,382
Spare me
your junior-year-abroad

502
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,150
moral opinion,
would you, Rapp?

503
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:53,482
Not really an opinion, sir.
Sharif's a piece of shit.

504
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:54,882
It's not a crusade.

505
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,915
This mission is practical.
Don't make it...

506
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,248
Personal?

507
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,581
Exactly.

508
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:00,581
Yes, sir.

509
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,381
Victor, you're with me.

510
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:04,481
Rapp, you and Annika
are eyes on.

511
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:07,747
Sharif has a routine.

512
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:09,381
Let's see if anything
breaks his pattern.

513
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,347
Got it?

514
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,347
Yes, sir.

515
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,380
All right, we got 48 hours.

516
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:15,745
Quick, clean.
No footprint.

517
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,679
This town's ready
to blow as it is.

518
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:03,443
Where the hell
are you going?

519
00:42:26,806 --> 00:42:28,507
That was
fucking reckless, Rapp.

520
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,206
I took
the initiative, sir.

521
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,339
He could've been made.

522
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,339
Well, I wasn't.

523
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,706
Here we go.

524
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:36,305
11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

525
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,472
A meeting at a restaurant
on Akbiyik Street.

526
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:41,371
That's right before Sharif
goes to see his mistress.

527
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:42,838
That breaks his pattern.

528
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:44,404
I'll tell you
what'll break his pattern.

529
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:45,872
When that fucking assistant
tells his boss

530
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,304
he lost his goddamn phone.

531
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:49,570
He won't.

532
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:52,370
He's too afraid of Sharif
to let him know
he screwed up.

533
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,370
All right. We go tomorrow.

534
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:55,670
What's the mission, sir?

535
00:42:55,704 --> 00:42:57,470
Eliminate the target.
Eliminate the recipient.

536
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:58,637
Obtain the package.

537
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,370
And what's
the package?

538
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:01,436
We'll know it
when we see it.

539
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:04,803
You're lead.

540
00:43:04,837 --> 00:43:06,103
You're backup.

541
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:41,666
He thinks we're married.

542
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,565
Don't think too much.

543
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:52,232
You'll lose your nerve.

544
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:54,466
No, I don't think so.

545
00:43:56,331 --> 00:43:57,865
It'll be your first time.

546
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:00,530
Yeah, not in my mind.

547
00:44:21,363 --> 00:44:24,362
Lead, your friend's
arriving now.

548
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,462
Copy.

549
00:44:34,794 --> 00:44:37,761
And he brought a shitload
of military protection.

550
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:46,194
I'll take care
of the MPs.

551
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:56,259
Oh, come on, now, honey.
Don't be mad.

552
00:44:56,926 --> 00:44:58,159
No, no, no.

553
00:44:58,193 --> 00:44:59,626
I had a few. Yeah, I did.

554
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,159
I'll make it up to you
when I get home.

555
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:02,492
You know that.

556
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:17,791
Call it in. Call it in,
or I'll cut
your fucking throat.

557
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,487
Lead, you're a go.

558
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:51,186
Survey 2, get in place.

559
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,487
Be careful in there.

560
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,487
I got it.

561
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:54,454
Pardon.

562
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:22,246
Target's gone. Target's gone.

563
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:24,646
Get back!

564
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:26,279
Lead?

565
00:47:26,879 --> 00:47:28,112
Dead.

566
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:31,312
Mission terminated.

567
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:34,344
Exfil to secure location.
Confirm.

568
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:38,744
Survey 2, you better let me
hear you fucking confirm.

569
00:47:38,777 --> 00:47:41,811
God damn it,
this is a fucking mess.
We're out of here.

570
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,239
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

571
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,239
I'm gonna hurt your boss.

572
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:12,701
Shit.

573
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,100
Hurry up!

574
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:33,434
Come on, come on, come on.

575
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:44,632
Come on.

576
00:51:40,122 --> 00:51:41,255
No, please.

577
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:44,487
Please, don't. Don't.

578
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:48,387
No.

579
00:52:03,524 --> 00:52:04,992
You disobeyed
a direct order.

580
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:06,627
No, I made a decision
to pursue the target,

581
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,262
and I completed the mission.

582
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,197
And, sir, isn't that
what I'm here to do?
Isn't that my job?

583
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,166
Your fucking job is to do
what I fucking tell you
to do!

584
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,602
What, you prefer
I leave him alive, then,

585
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,237
let him go?
That piece of shit?

586
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:22,510
Stan?

587
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,745
Good, you're here.
I wanna show you something.

588
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:25,780
Wait here.

589
03:53:06,616 --> 03:53:08,384
Look at that.
That's the kind of bullshit

590
03:53:08,417 --> 03:53:09,685
that could shut us down.

591
03:53:09,719 --> 03:53:11,788
Kid can't even follow
a fucking order.

592
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,687
Victor got made.
Rapp didn't.

593
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,020
Why does this kid give you
such a fucking hard-on?

594
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:35,019
Don't talk to me like that!
I'm your superior.

595
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:36,119
My superior, Irene?

596
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,553
Your superior,
God damn it.

597
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:41,152
Do you have any idea
how long I spent looking

598
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:43,052
for someone with
that kid's talent and balls?

599
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,152
Rapp stays.

600
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:46,652
You're
giving me an order?

601
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:47,918
That's an affirmative.

602
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:51,085
Can you give us a minute?

603
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:56,284
Look at this.

604
00:52:58,151 --> 00:53:00,050
The trigger
must have been
in that car.

605
00:53:04,116 --> 00:53:06,149
Look at him.

606
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,483
Lookin' at me.

607
00:53:08,582 --> 00:53:10,548
Everything he did there,

608
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:12,049
I taught him how to do it.

609
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:13,682
Stan.

610
00:53:13,716 --> 00:53:16,182
I should've left him
in the Navy.

611
00:53:16,215 --> 00:53:17,282
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

612
00:53:17,316 --> 00:53:18,448
Stan, listen to me.

613
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:19,981
The only thing
that matters now

614
00:53:20,015 --> 00:53:21,448
is that fucking lunatic
has everything he needs

615
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:22,548
to build a nuclear weapon.

616
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:28,414
He's got a trigger.
Now he needs to buy
a physicist.

617
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,947
We just have to figure out

618
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:31,547
where they're gonna
build this thing.

619
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,313
Ben.

620
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:37,279
That computer our boy Rapp
lifted from Sharif's house,

621
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,546
there's evidence
of a $2 million transfer
to a bank account in Rome.

622
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:42,312
Cash prepped
for withdrawal.

623
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:43,412
Rome.

624
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,470
Your money.

625
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:12,037
I've been
reading up, Minister.

626
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:15,203
You Iranians probably
all learn this growing up,

627
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:17,336
or at least you did
before you signed
that treaty.

628
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:21,869
But me, I had no idea
about these fun facts.

629
00:55:24,036 --> 00:55:25,536
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

630
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:31,201
Inside three miles,
apparently you just vaporize.

631
00:55:31,235 --> 00:55:33,401
Some folks don't.

632
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:35,400
They get all
black and charred,

633
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:39,901
and dense as lead,
and no one knows why.

634
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:43,332
Inside five miles,
everything is sucked
into a void,

635
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:45,566
hotter than
the core of the sun.

636
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,100
How about that?

637
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:56,165
You'll get the rest
of your money
when the job's done.

638
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,465
Where is my physicist?

639
00:56:01,498 --> 00:56:04,131
He'll pick up his money,
then we'll pick him up.

640
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:09,264
We'll need an extra day
to configure the weapon,
then it's all yours.

641
00:56:09,298 --> 00:56:11,464
Kill as many Jews
as you want.

642
00:56:15,297 --> 00:56:18,463
Do you practice
Salah, brother?

643
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:22,029
I receive my payment,
complete the project.

644
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,563
That's my practice, brother.

645
00:56:25,596 --> 00:56:26,862
Very well.

646
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:01,025
Who was that guy?

647
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:03,059
In Istanbul.

648
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:08,092
It seemed like
he was a step ahead
of us.

649
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:13,157
Hey, you gonna
fill me in here
or what?

650
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:15,223
There's some bad people
planning on doing
some bad things,

651
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:16,423
and it's our job
to stop them.

652
00:57:19,423 --> 00:57:21,289
You still haven't said
anything about Victor.

653
00:57:21,323 --> 00:57:23,990
Victor's gone.
Victor doesn't exist.

654
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:32,056
What is it you think
we do here, Rapp?

655
00:57:35,355 --> 00:57:37,255
I think we kill people
who need to be killed.

656
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,288
And who do you trust
to tell you?

657
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:39,655
I follow orders.

658
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,488
No, you follow orders
when they suit you.

659
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:43,021
This whole thing
is pretty much

660
00:57:43,054 --> 00:57:45,987
just a means to an end
for you, isn't it?

661
00:57:46,021 --> 00:57:47,420
A lot's happened
in my life, sir.

662
00:57:47,453 --> 00:57:49,453
Really? Huh.

663
00:57:47,453 --> 00:57:49,453
Yeah.

664
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:50,952
So you think
you were sent here

665
00:57:50,987 --> 00:57:53,254
as an outlet
for your self-pity,

666
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:56,386
and your anger,
and all your guilt. Right?

667
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,919
Patriotism exists

668
00:57:59,953 --> 00:58:03,986
because people like you
and people like me
need a higher cause.

669
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:06,318
Something bigger than us.

670
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,119
That stink coming outta you

671
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,051
you like to call "revenge,"
the rest of us call "shit."

672
00:58:11,084 --> 00:58:12,584
And as soon as
it starts to feel good,

673
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,418
that's when you stop
being a professional.

674
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:15,885
And then what are you?

675
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,116
Tell us something good,
darling.

676
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,016
We're in their system.

677
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:32,115
The moment that transfer
from Sharif's account
is picked up,

678
00:58:32,149 --> 00:58:34,082
we'll know it.

679
00:58:34,116 --> 00:58:37,015
Boy, you just smile,
and the Red Sea parts.

680
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,381
Works in the Med, too.

681
00:58:40,415 --> 00:58:42,648
I'll bet it does.

682
00:58:56,446 --> 00:59:00,112
Cash withdrawal
from Sharif's account.
$2 million, U.S.

683
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:41,609
There's our physicist.
Let's go.

684
01:00:30,271 --> 01:00:32,570
Welcome to the Boscolo
and enjoy your stay.

685
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:34,304
Thank you very much.

686
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:34,304
Thank you.

687
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:45,001
He's in 1448.

688
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:46,836
And we're next door.

689
01:01:16,366 --> 01:01:17,398
Code in.

690
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,899
Victor-Charlie 1109.

691
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:20,498
Confirmed.

692
01:01:20,531 --> 01:01:22,897
Suite 1448.
We're in 1449,
right next door.

693
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:25,997
All right.
We'll grab the physicist,

694
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:28,197
and we'll take out whosever
coming for him.

695
01:01:28,231 --> 01:01:29,865
Signal every 15 minutes.

696
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:12,459
Hey.

697
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:24,991
I know what happened
to you.

698
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:27,525
I'm sorry.

699
01:02:34,491 --> 01:02:36,192
I understand you.

700
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,925
More than you know.

701
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:54,155
I know what it's like
to lose people you love.

702
01:02:59,188 --> 01:03:01,520
We're gonna get
these fuckers.

703
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
Fuck!

704
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:20,853
Where the hell are you?

705
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,617
Hurley...

706
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,250
Where is he?

707
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,117
I don't know
what you're talking...

708
01:04:04,282 --> 01:04:05,482
Where is he?

709
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:07,381
He outside?

710
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,276
Please, no.

711
01:04:58,109 --> 01:04:59,109
Please.

712
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:03,475
Hurley,
what the fuck?

713
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:04,942
I thought you were eyes on,
why didn't you spot 'em?

714
01:05:04,976 --> 01:05:07,241
They were already
in the damn hotel.

715
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:08,875
Local mafia's
working with 'em.

716
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:21,274
I'll tell Kennedy
we have the physicist.

717
01:05:24,907 --> 01:05:26,973
What the hell
just happened
out there, huh?

718
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,039
That's twice now this guy's
blown up our entire op.

719
01:05:29,073 --> 01:05:31,439
What's the target?
Huh? What's the target?

720
01:05:31,472 --> 01:05:33,106
I don't know, mister.

721
01:05:31,472 --> 01:05:33,106
Yeah, you do.

722
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,406
Huh?

723
01:05:35,439 --> 01:05:36,872
Do you think I'm stupid?

724
01:05:36,905 --> 01:05:38,205
He's an American.
He said your name.

725
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:39,605
Did you train this guy?

726
01:05:39,638 --> 01:05:43,071
You like to smoke?

727
01:05:39,638 --> 01:05:43,071
Oh, Jesus Christ!

728
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:44,937
Are you a smoker?

729
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:44,937
I don't...

730
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,369
Wait!

731
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,369
Bad habit.

732
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:49,104
Wait, stop! Wait, wait!
I know something.

733
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,571
What do you know?

734
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,571
I know something.

735
01:05:50,604 --> 01:05:54,269
There is a man... There is
a man they call Ghost.

736
01:05:54,303 --> 01:05:58,203
Ghost. I think it was
an Iranian man said it.

737
01:05:58,237 --> 01:05:59,603
Uh-huh. Where are they
building the bomb?

738
01:05:58,237 --> 01:05:59,603
I just...

739
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:01,069
Where are they building it?

740
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:01,069
...took the money.

741
01:06:01,103 --> 01:06:02,870
Where are they building it?

742
01:06:02,903 --> 01:06:04,802
All right, here.
Take some time
to think about it.

743
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:08,170
Ghost. Is that his name?

744
01:06:09,468 --> 01:06:11,868
Why is this guy after you?

745
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,468
Something personal, sir?

746
01:06:13,501 --> 01:06:15,235
They're building a nuke.

747
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:20,267
Hotel Navona.

748
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,100
Clean yourself up.

749
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,100
Wait.

750
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:25,199
Don't go.

751
01:06:25,234 --> 01:06:27,333
America's president
has ordered the Sixth Fleet

752
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:29,599
out of the U.S. Naval base
in Naples, Italy.

753
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:32,233
The Sixth Fleet is now
southwest off the coast...

754
01:06:33,499 --> 01:06:34,832
Let me help you.

755
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,065
No, it's okay.
I'm fine.

756
01:06:36,099 --> 01:06:37,332
You're not.

757
01:06:55,497 --> 01:06:57,298
How are you holding up?

758
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:03,397
I was afraid today.

759
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,261
I thought
we were going to die.

760
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:08,529
Yeah, I'm either
always afraid
or never afraid.

761
01:07:08,562 --> 01:07:10,196
I don't know which.

762
01:07:27,061 --> 01:07:28,828
There you go.

763
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,094
Just relax now.

764
01:07:40,892 --> 01:07:42,891
We'll search for
Ghost tomorrow.

765
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,390
You scared me.

766
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,322
Who are you?

767
01:08:02,357 --> 01:08:03,924
What do you mean?

768
01:08:03,957 --> 01:08:05,923
You said "Ghost."

769
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,323
What about him?

770
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,323
I never told you that name.

771
01:08:08,356 --> 01:08:09,556
Hurley did.

772
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:11,489
Yeah, I think
you're full of shit.

773
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,189
Mitch.

774
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,189
Who are you?

775
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,790
Mitch, what's wrong with you?

776
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,790
Who do you work for?

777
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:16,889
I'm CIA.

778
01:08:16,922 --> 01:08:18,888
Now don't fucking lie to me!

779
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,255
I'm not lying!

780
01:08:21,488 --> 01:08:23,588
You're Iranian, aren't you?

781
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,087
Get the fuck away from me!

782
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:37,086
Are you working
with the Iranians?

783
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:41,153
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth!

784
01:08:53,618 --> 01:08:55,385
You Iranian intelligence?

785
01:08:55,418 --> 01:08:57,484
Are you Iranian intelligence?

786
01:09:06,082 --> 01:09:08,048
What do you know
about Ghost?

787
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:29,815
We're gonna need
the decryption device.

788
01:09:35,848 --> 01:09:37,314
You were right, Mitch.

789
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:39,947
This Iranian mole
is a tough nut
to crack.

790
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,380
All I could get from her
was her handler.
Azad Ashani.

791
01:09:42,413 --> 01:09:43,511
Happens to be
a friend of mine.

792
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,912
I'm gonna go
pay him a visit.

793
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,312
Okay, I'm going with you.

794
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,312
No.

795
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:48,945
I need you to stay here.

796
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:50,512
Kennedy's on her way
with the CIA team

797
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:51,945
and a Mossad team.

798
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,211
She's gonna ask me
where you went.

799
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:54,878
What the hell
am I supposed to say?

800
01:09:54,912 --> 01:09:56,179
That's right, she is.
And you're gonna be smart,

801
01:09:56,212 --> 01:09:57,211
and you're gonna
keep your mouth shut,

802
01:09:57,245 --> 01:09:58,912
and you're gonna
cover my ass.

803
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:24,975
I still have it.

804
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:29,342
Very nice.

805
01:10:31,142 --> 01:10:34,008
I am always happy
to meet you, Stan...

806
01:10:36,007 --> 01:10:38,940
But never happy why.

807
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:41,507
Well, maybe next time
we'll meet for pizza.

808
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,807
Your girl's tough,
by the way.

809
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,438
Go easy on her.

810
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:48,773
She's my niece.

811
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:51,339
Yeah.

812
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,238
What have you got for me?

813
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:04,504
The men behind all this
are General Rostami,

814
01:11:04,538 --> 01:11:07,104
our military
chief of staff,

815
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:10,004
and our defense minister,
Behruz.

816
01:11:10,038 --> 01:11:12,204
Both are very powerful,

817
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:16,370
and both are very angry
about the nuclear treaty
we made with you.

818
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:18,269
They have been
trying to acquire

819
01:11:18,303 --> 01:11:21,169
nuclear materials
for the past two years.

820
01:11:21,203 --> 01:11:22,903
And they are the ones

821
01:11:22,936 --> 01:11:25,368
who hired the mercenary
called Ghost.

822
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:31,335
Rostami is now in Tehran,
but Behruz is here in Rome.

823
01:11:31,368 --> 01:11:36,301
Annika has been tracking
his movements
through his cell phone.

824
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,468
And they're
building it here?

825
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,201
I wish I knew.

826
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:41,967
We have their physicist.

827
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,933
They can't build it
without him.

828
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:44,033
But...

829
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:48,133
The mercenary asked Behruz

830
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:51,000
to use one of ours,
an Iranian.

831
01:11:51,033 --> 01:11:54,799
Behruz agreed.
That was rash.

832
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,533
It means
they are in a hurry.

833
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,331
And the target's Israel?

834
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:03,498
I wish I had
better information for you.

835
01:12:11,598 --> 01:12:13,165
Where the hell is Hurley?

836
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:15,030
You gotta tell me
what's going on here. Now.

837
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,030
That guy he trained,
who the hell is he?

838
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:18,897
That's not something
you need to know
right now.

839
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,963
What are you covering up?

840
01:12:20,996 --> 01:12:22,996
When you've got a level-5
security clearance

841
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:24,463
and 20 years' experience,
talk to me.

842
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:26,395
Until then,
shut up and do your job.

843
01:12:31,462 --> 01:12:34,495
I want her cell phone
decrypted and scanned.

844
01:12:34,528 --> 01:12:36,328
Local PD pulled a body
from the harbor an hour ago.

845
01:12:36,361 --> 01:12:37,895
Gunshot to the chest.

846
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:40,028
Iranian intelligence officer,
Azad Ashani.

847
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:42,293
Christ!

848
01:12:42,328 --> 01:12:44,327
That's the guy
Hurley went to meet.

849
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,094
Stupid son of a bitch!

850
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,861
All right, so what do we do?
We gotta go after him.

851
01:12:47,894 --> 01:12:50,094
There's a fucking nuke
in play, Rapp.

852
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:53,393
That's the mission,
and the only mission.

853
01:12:53,426 --> 01:12:55,160
This is now a joint
CIA-Mossad operation,

854
01:12:55,194 --> 01:12:56,460
whether we like it or not.

855
01:12:56,493 --> 01:12:57,993
Can you get the Director
on the phone?

856
01:12:58,026 --> 01:13:00,092
So you're just gonna
write him off then?

857
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,958
That's the plan?

858
01:13:01,992 --> 01:13:04,159
Stan Hurley is
the closest thing
to family I've got.

859
01:13:04,193 --> 01:13:05,325
And if he were
standing here right now,

860
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:06,992
his only question would be,

861
01:13:07,025 --> 01:13:08,458
why are we wasting our breath
talking about him?

862
01:13:10,325 --> 01:13:11,525
You're through here.

863
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,091
You're going home,
that's an order.

864
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:16,491
Now, sit down
and shut up.

865
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:10,118
Why are you helping me?

866
01:14:10,152 --> 01:14:12,085
Your handler Ashani
was killed.

867
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,951
Hurley was with him.
Something happened.

868
01:14:13,985 --> 01:14:14,985
I'm going after him.

869
01:14:17,585 --> 01:14:19,052
I need your help.

870
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:22,183
We gotta go.

871
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,081
Stan.

872
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,148
I've looked forward to this.

873
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:54,080
I'm sure you have, Ronnie.

874
01:14:55,414 --> 01:14:57,148
I wanna show you something.

875
01:14:57,181 --> 01:14:58,214
All right.

876
01:15:11,046 --> 01:15:12,780
Savages. Right, Stan?

877
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:17,178
But you know something?
I don't blame them.

878
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:19,544
I blame you.

879
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:21,111
Never would've happened

880
01:15:21,144 --> 01:15:22,310
if you would have
followed orders, Ronnie.

881
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:24,344
"You go down out there,
you're a ghost.

882
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,878
"You're a John Doe.

883
01:15:25,911 --> 01:15:28,344
"You get captured?"

884
01:15:28,377 --> 01:15:30,510
Oh, you remember.
That's very gratifying.

885
01:15:30,544 --> 01:15:31,543
Thank you.

886
01:15:31,577 --> 01:15:33,244
You made me proud
today, Ron.

887
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:37,310
You should've come for me.

888
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:40,275
Ten men would've died.

889
01:15:40,309 --> 01:15:41,842
You put 10 men's lives
in danger,

890
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:43,876
'cause you couldn't follow
a fucking order.

891
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:45,175
Fuck you.

892
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:45,175
Fuck orders.

893
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:46,909
Fuck the mission!

894
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:46,909
Fuck you.

895
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,275
This was me.
I was your boy,
I believe that.

896
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:50,408
You made me believe that.

897
01:16:01,007 --> 01:16:02,939
Ashani had their people
tracking Minister Behruz's

898
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:03,873
secure cell phone.

899
01:16:05,506 --> 01:16:07,207
So, we find Behruz,
we find Hurley.

900
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,305
Mitch!

901
01:17:06,467 --> 01:17:08,433
Oh, yeah,
look at that.

902
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:10,134
Did you learn that
in Aleppo?

903
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,466
No.

904
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,734
You always told us
what to expect, Stan.

905
01:17:19,032 --> 01:17:20,465
Now,

906
01:17:20,499 --> 01:17:21,866
where's the rest of
your team?

907
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:24,899
Come on, Ronnie, really?

908
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,765
Don't call me that.
Where's the rest of
your team?

909
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:28,965
Your new boy out there,
he on my tail?

910
01:17:28,998 --> 01:17:32,431
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.
There's your first mistake.

911
01:17:32,464 --> 01:17:35,430
You never start
with a real question.

912
01:17:35,464 --> 01:17:37,764
You start slow.

913
01:17:37,798 --> 01:17:39,264
You get inside
your subject's head.

914
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:43,196
Stan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

915
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:46,063
There's your
second mistake. Number two.

916
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,529
You don't say,
"one more time."
You already...

917
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,763
Damn!

918
01:17:53,896 --> 01:17:56,995
Now, what's that
third mistake, Stan?

919
01:17:57,028 --> 01:17:58,960
Huh? What is it?

920
01:17:58,995 --> 01:18:00,894
Go ahead! Go ahead!

921
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:03,394
I got nine more! I like this.

922
01:18:03,427 --> 01:18:05,827
I like it.
Go ahead, bring it on!

923
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:06,928
You motherfucker!

924
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,259
Ronnie wants to know
if I got a team outside.

925
01:18:12,294 --> 01:18:13,427
Right, Ron?

926
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,027
If it's safe
to move your bomb.

927
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:18,960
Are we being followed?

928
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,192
Where's the new me?

929
01:18:22,226 --> 01:18:24,793
I've done my research.
I know all about him.

930
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,292
"The new me..."
Oh, you mean Mitch?

931
01:18:27,325 --> 01:18:29,992
You know, Mitch,
he's unpredictable.

932
01:18:30,025 --> 01:18:31,258
You never know about Mitch.

933
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:32,859
He might be here,
he might be there.

934
01:18:32,892 --> 01:18:34,458
He's like you, but you're
a real Section 8.

935
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:35,524
Enough.

936
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:37,891
Schizo mom.

937
01:18:35,558 --> 01:18:37,891
Where are they?

938
01:18:37,924 --> 01:18:39,391
Loser dad.

939
01:18:37,924 --> 01:18:39,391
Where are they?

940
01:18:41,557 --> 01:18:42,890
God!

941
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:47,790
Where's the rest of
your team?

942
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,256
Half-wit mom, psycho dad...

943
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,490
Where's the rest of
your team?

944
01:18:50,523 --> 01:18:52,022
You're pond scum.

945
01:18:50,523 --> 01:18:52,022
Where are they?

946
01:18:52,056 --> 01:18:54,256
Pond scum!
You're fucking...

947
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:06,288
I'm sorry
about your handler.

948
01:19:07,155 --> 01:19:08,888
Ashani was my uncle.

949
01:19:11,155 --> 01:19:12,855
I'm sure
it was Minister Behruz

950
01:19:12,888 --> 01:19:15,754
and General Rostami
who had him killed.

951
01:19:15,787 --> 01:19:18,453
They want nuclear war
with Israel.

952
01:19:18,486 --> 01:19:20,319
We tried to stop them.

953
01:19:20,353 --> 01:19:23,219
My brother and father
both died fighting them.

954
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,053
Corviale. Turn here.

955
01:19:32,552 --> 01:19:34,885
You know what
my real mistake was?

956
01:19:35,885 --> 01:19:38,184
I trusted you.

957
01:19:38,218 --> 01:19:41,218
You made me feel like
I was the Second Coming.

958
01:19:42,451 --> 01:19:45,018
And you acted like my father.

959
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:51,451
I trusted you and I trusted
the United States Navy.

960
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:03,415
U.S. of A. does it,
it's gotta be good.
Right, Stan?

961
01:20:04,182 --> 01:20:05,482
Except

962
01:20:05,516 --> 01:20:08,882
nobody told me the business
y'all are really in.

963
01:20:12,148 --> 01:20:14,013
You create monsters.

964
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:15,346
That's just what you do.

965
01:20:16,547 --> 01:20:19,114
Those people
who did this to me,

966
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,313
you think
they're barbarians?

967
01:20:22,013 --> 01:20:23,213
Bullshit.

968
01:20:31,012 --> 01:20:33,112
Where's the decryption
I asked for?

969
01:20:33,146 --> 01:20:35,846
Rapp grabbed her smartphone
before we could get
any of it.

970
01:20:35,879 --> 01:20:38,011
And we can't find him.

971
01:20:38,045 --> 01:20:39,846
Surveillance cameras
picked up Rapp

972
01:20:39,879 --> 01:20:41,912
taking out our agents
five minutes ago.

973
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:47,011
What the hell are you doing?

974
01:20:55,244 --> 01:20:57,176
There's not a single thing
happening here

975
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:58,409
that you didn't make happen.

976
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:03,976
God bless fucking America,
huh, Stan?

977
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:06,742
Hoorah!

978
01:21:08,075 --> 01:21:09,775
Hoorah!

979
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,907
I can tell you
where Mitch is...

980
01:21:12,941 --> 01:21:15,475
What's that
third mistake, Stan?

981
01:21:15,508 --> 01:21:16,507
Mitch...

982
01:21:16,541 --> 01:21:17,840
I can't hear you.

983
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:19,940
Fuck!

984
01:21:25,406 --> 01:21:26,506
Third mistake,

985
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:29,107
never get too close.

986
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,072
Finish your
personal business here.

987
01:21:31,106 --> 01:21:32,773
Your work is done.

988
01:21:32,806 --> 01:21:34,206
The bomb is armed.

989
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,506
Timer is set up?

990
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,506
Yes.

991
01:21:35,539 --> 01:21:36,939
He's playing you.

992
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:39,172
Bomb's not for you,
it's for him.

993
01:21:39,205 --> 01:21:40,772
It was his plan all along!

994
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,168
Dead zone.

995
01:22:14,201 --> 01:22:16,468
We're not getting
any signals here.

996
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,001
Come on. Come on.

997
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:29,834
Wait a second.

998
01:22:54,164 --> 01:22:55,963
What are you gonna do
with it?

999
01:22:55,997 --> 01:22:57,363
No, Stan.

1000
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:00,130
"What are we gonna do
with it?"

1001
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,396
Why are we in Rome, Ronnie?

1002
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,029
I like Rome.

1003
01:23:08,063 --> 01:23:09,163
It's good food.

1004
01:23:14,028 --> 01:23:17,295
Never, ever thought
I'd die in the field.

1005
01:23:18,528 --> 01:23:20,728
Ain't it crazy?

1006
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:23,761
I always figured it would be,
I don't know,

1007
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:28,128
some cabin in the woods
with my dog.

1008
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:29,861
Me?

1009
01:23:29,894 --> 01:23:32,127
I think I want water.

1010
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,260
There's just something
peaceful about dying at sea.

1011
01:23:40,127 --> 01:23:41,260
All right.

1012
01:23:43,793 --> 01:23:45,092
Let's get it over with.

1013
01:23:45,126 --> 01:23:47,224
No, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1014
01:23:47,259 --> 01:23:48,325
I ain't gonna kill you.

1015
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,724
You're gonna live to see

1016
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,725
the crown of
your creation, Stan.

1017
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:56,891
Thousands of Americans
are gonna burn.

1018
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:59,723
All because of you.

1019
01:24:01,224 --> 01:24:02,857
Enjoy the show.

1020
01:24:04,524 --> 01:24:05,957
Get ready.

1021
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,119
Go.

1022
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,246
Please help me.

1023
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,046
Annika.

1024
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:21,976
Whoa!

1025
01:27:33,936 --> 01:27:35,670
We've got
an explosion detected.

1026
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:37,735
Here.

1027
01:27:37,768 --> 01:27:39,834
A half click
off the Fiumicino waterways.

1028
01:27:40,901 --> 01:27:42,234
It's underground.

1029
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,068
Delta One, go!

1030
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,068
Let's go.

1031
01:27:44,101 --> 01:27:45,834
Get a chopper
out there.

1032
01:28:17,364 --> 01:28:19,098
You're not supposed
to be here, Rapp.

1033
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:21,064
Yeah, what are you
gonna do, fire me?

1034
01:28:21,098 --> 01:28:23,698
There's another passage
down there.
He's got the nuke.

1035
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:25,864
You gonna be good?

1036
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:25,864
Go. Go!

1037
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:07,192
Put the gun down.

1038
01:29:07,226 --> 01:29:08,960
Or she's dead.

1039
01:29:10,991 --> 01:29:13,025
I want to see
my family, Mitch.

1040
01:29:14,025 --> 01:29:16,924
No, Annika, you don't.

1041
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:18,358
I want to see my family.

1042
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:20,457
Come on, Mitch.
Be nice.

1043
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,124
She wants to live.

1044
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:24,057
She wants to see her family.

1045
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:25,758
Put the gun down.

1046
01:29:29,024 --> 01:29:30,024
Annika!

1047
01:31:27,278 --> 01:31:29,010
The bomb can't be stopped.

1048
01:31:29,044 --> 01:31:30,711
Just like you couldn't stop

1049
01:31:30,744 --> 01:31:33,044
that beautiful girl from
dying on the beach.

1050
01:31:37,943 --> 01:31:38,943
Irene.

1051
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:41,977
The bomb's on a boat.

1052
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:43,309
Hurley?

1053
01:31:43,342 --> 01:31:44,909
How do you know?

1054
01:31:44,943 --> 01:31:47,143
Ronnie wanted to die at sea.

1055
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:53,341
Is the Sixth Fleet
out on maneuvers?

1056
01:31:56,008 --> 01:31:57,040
Oh, my God.

1057
01:31:57,075 --> 01:31:58,374
Bring up ISR feeds.

1058
01:31:58,408 --> 01:31:59,940
Get me eyes in the sky
over the coastline

1059
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:02,907
and put the Sixth Fleet
on nuclear alert.

1060
01:32:02,941 --> 01:32:04,974
Tom.

1061
01:32:05,007 --> 01:32:07,674
The target is
the Sixth Fleet
and it's 25 miles offshore.

1062
01:32:14,906 --> 01:32:16,439
It's a shame.

1063
01:32:16,473 --> 01:32:20,973
The last thing your girl saw
was you not saving her.

1064
01:32:32,805 --> 01:32:33,971
General quarters.

1065
01:32:34,004 --> 01:32:35,903
All hands,
man your stations.

1066
01:32:35,937 --> 01:32:38,903
This is not a drill.
I repeat,
this is not a drill.

1067
01:32:38,937 --> 01:32:41,770
Inbound, small vessel-borne
nuclear device.

1068
01:32:41,804 --> 01:32:43,204
Man decon stations.

1069
01:32:48,203 --> 01:32:50,770
Didn't Hurley teach you
anything, little brother?

1070
01:32:56,436 --> 01:32:59,036
To never make it personal.

1071
01:33:10,133 --> 01:33:11,433
This isn't personal.

1072
01:33:19,332 --> 01:33:20,399
Shit.

1073
01:33:21,999 --> 01:33:25,265
The bomb has a timer
and a release trigger.

1074
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,899
We take out his boat,
it'll detonate.

1075
01:33:27,932 --> 01:33:29,898
If it goes off
above the waterline...

1076
01:33:29,932 --> 01:33:32,797
Disaster. There'll be fallout
all over the mainland.

1077
01:33:36,198 --> 01:33:37,831
USS Flynn...

1078
01:33:37,864 --> 01:33:39,198
Prepare to engage.

1079
01:33:50,129 --> 01:33:51,429
The boat
is turning, sir.

1080
01:33:51,463 --> 01:33:53,130
Who's driving that boat?

1081
01:33:56,462 --> 01:33:57,662
Rapp.

1082
01:34:00,796 --> 01:34:01,894
Go.

1083
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,828
Sir?

1084
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:03,828
Go!

1085
01:34:11,261 --> 01:34:14,027
What are you doing? Hurley.

1086
01:34:14,061 --> 01:34:16,160
Hurley?

1087
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:17,694
Trying to get
our boy to throw the bomb
in the water.

1088
01:34:17,727 --> 01:34:20,293
Flynn, you are clear
to fire when ready.

1089
01:34:20,326 --> 01:34:23,259
Do not fire, Commander.
The boat is turning.

1090
01:34:23,293 --> 01:34:26,259
If we don't engage,
that guarantees detonation.

1091
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:27,425
I understand there's a risk,

1092
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,992
but this is the best chance
we've got.

1093
01:34:29,025 --> 01:34:31,025
Shit! God damn it!

1094
01:34:39,024 --> 01:34:40,890
There he is.

1095
01:34:40,924 --> 01:34:42,990
Get me on that boat's
marine bandwidth.

1096
01:34:46,857 --> 01:34:47,857
Rapp!

1097
01:34:48,457 --> 01:34:50,124
Rapp!

1098
01:34:50,157 --> 01:34:52,757
Can you hear me?
Pick up the radio!

1099
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:55,689
Throw the bomb overboard!

1100
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:57,889
No way, sir, I gotta get
further away from the fleet!

1101
01:34:57,923 --> 01:34:59,289
Rapp!

1102
01:34:59,322 --> 01:35:02,088
For once in your life,
take a goddamn order!

1103
01:35:02,122 --> 01:35:03,989
The Sixth Fleet is
about to blow you to hell!

1104
01:35:15,121 --> 01:35:17,087
Command,
Delta Two,

1105
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,787
the bomb's in the water.

1106
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,985
Commander, hold your fire!
The bomb's in the water.

1107
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:22,953
Flynn, hold fire!

1108
01:35:22,987 --> 01:35:24,020
Hold fire!

1109
01:35:24,054 --> 01:35:25,621
Hold fire!

1110
01:35:55,450 --> 01:35:57,416
Got less than 30 seconds.

1111
01:36:01,283 --> 01:36:02,382
All right, go!
Get outta here!

1112
01:36:22,981 --> 01:36:23,981
Jesus.

1113
01:37:04,309 --> 01:37:06,142
Brace for impact.

1114
01:37:06,176 --> 01:37:07,643
Sir, yes, sir!

1115
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:14,376
Holy shit.

1116
01:37:54,904 --> 01:37:56,104
Hold on!

1117
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,303
Brace!

1118
01:38:51,432 --> 01:38:53,166
You shouldn't have
come for me.

1119
01:38:55,132 --> 01:38:57,198
Don't get used to it, son.

1120
01:38:59,297 --> 01:39:01,931
Hurley...

1121
01:39:01,964 --> 01:39:04,264
Looks like we're gonna
be all right up here.

1122
01:39:05,097 --> 01:39:06,097
I think.

1123
01:39:10,763 --> 01:39:13,695
Damage control central.
Report.

1124
01:39:13,729 --> 01:39:15,062
Pressure is normalizing.

1125
01:39:15,096 --> 01:39:17,262
We have multiple
hull breaches.

1126
01:39:17,295 --> 01:39:19,096
Radiologicals, Eisenhower?

1127
01:39:19,129 --> 01:39:20,962
Low... Low levels.

1128
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:24,662
Initiating countermeasure
wash-down.

1129
01:39:24,695 --> 01:39:26,395
Commander,
any casualties?

1130
01:39:26,428 --> 01:39:28,361
The Flynn took
some serious damage.

1131
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:30,327
The casualty reports
aren't in yet,

1132
01:39:30,361 --> 01:39:33,361
but if it had gone off
above the waterline,
I don't think we'd be here.

1133
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:34,961
Eisenhower,

1134
01:39:35,994 --> 01:39:38,127
my prayers are with you all.

1135
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:01,891
Hurley, is Rapp there?

1136
01:40:02,858 --> 01:40:04,024
Hold on a minute.

1137
01:40:09,124 --> 01:40:10,323
Yeah, go ahead.

1138
01:40:10,357 --> 01:40:11,991
You okay, Mitch?

1139
01:40:12,024 --> 01:40:13,756
Oh, yeah. I'm fantastic.

1140
01:40:18,856 --> 01:40:20,889
You saved
a lot of lives today.

1141
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:24,222
Took some losses, too.

1142
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:30,982
What the hell
are you looking at?

1143
01:41:31,016 --> 01:41:32,816
You look like a mummy.

1144
01:41:32,849 --> 01:41:34,182
Yeah.

1145
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:36,247
Well...

1146
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:38,381
A mummy doesn't have to
write up reports.

1147
01:41:38,414 --> 01:41:40,913
Dictate them.
You should be good
at that.

1148
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:44,714
Iranian official,
General Rostami,

1149
01:41:44,747 --> 01:41:46,713
the leader of the minority
opposition in Tehran,

1150
01:41:46,747 --> 01:41:49,080
claims that he has proof
that a secret group

1151
01:41:49,114 --> 01:41:51,347
of assassins
within America's CIA

1152
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,112
are responsible for
last week's nuclear event.

1153
01:41:54,146 --> 01:41:55,979
With the Iranian
presidential election

1154
01:41:56,013 --> 01:41:57,713
just two weeks away,

1155
01:41:57,746 --> 01:42:01,079
General Rostami continues
to rise in popularity.

1156
01:42:01,112 --> 01:42:02,712
They say
General Rostami is

1157
01:42:02,746 --> 01:42:04,379
gonna be
the next President
of Iran.

1158
01:42:04,412 --> 01:42:06,212
Yeah.

1159
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:08,078
He didn't even have to
blow up Israel
to get there.

1160
01:42:08,112 --> 01:42:10,078
He's gonna be
a major pain
in the ass, too.

1161
01:42:10,111 --> 01:42:12,677
Where's Rapp?
I can't reach him.

1162
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,345
How the hell do I know
where Rapp is?

1163
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,911
I'm a mummy in a hospital.

1164
01:42:15,944 --> 01:42:18,210
Rostami has full support
for restarting

1165
01:42:18,244 --> 01:42:20,077
Iran's nuclear program.
