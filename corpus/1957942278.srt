1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,481
Grandma.

2
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:16,618
Hey, what are you hiding
behind your back?

3
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,185
Aren't you the smart one?

4
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,454
Grandma brought
you girls a present.

5
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,828
<i>Snakes on a Train?</i>

6
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:28,763
I thought
they were on a plane.

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,165
Well, it's the funny snake movie
you girls wanted to see

8
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:37,070
when you came to visit,
with that actor who, um...

9
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,840
eh, is in everything.

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,576
- We love it. Thank you.
- Aww.

11
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,445
Oh, so welcome,
my sweethearts. Ohh.

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,250
So Grandma is gonna
go take a nap, so enjoy.

13
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,351
- We will.

14
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,820
Bye.

15
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:54,421
You think she forgot

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,423
the reason Dad wouldn't
let us see the other one

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,625
is 'cause it's R-rated?

18
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,877
So what's this one rated?

19
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,214
Is that
the first-place prize winner

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,482
you girls are building there?

21
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,284
- I hope so.
- Better be,

22
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,353
because we play to win,
right, Quinn?

23
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,354
Uh-huh.

24
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,656
That-a-girl, Maddie.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,424
Now I want the both of you

26
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,627
to watch your fingers playing
with those magnets, okay?

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,729
Oh, don't worry. We're not
gonna get our fingers pinched.

28
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,664
Yeah, we're being super careful.

29
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,566
We don't want to end up
in the emergency room.

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,901
Right.

31
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,269
Okay, but your grandma's
upstairs sleeping,

32
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,171
so please keep it down in here.

33
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,707
Don't wake her up. Okay?

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,474
I'm gonna go bring
her luggage upstairs.

35
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,647
Quick. Turn it back on.

36
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,415
Eww.

37
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,218
- He's cutting into his arm.
- Eww, that's so gross.

38
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,387
Shh. Don't want to wake Grandma.

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,222
You're too young to see this.

40
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,223
Quit it!

41
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,792
I want to see what happens!

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,705
So how does
your experiment work?

43
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,408
Okay, so see
how the penny won't stick?

44
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,210
But then...

45
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,279
But when we turn the hanger into
a conductor by magnetizing it...

46
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,751
Ah.

47
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:33,821
You built
a ferromagnetic apparatus.

48
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:37,290
Aren't you girls
only in the fifth grade?

49
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,358
Brilliant.

50
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,628
Nice.

51
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,830
First-place winners
of this year's

52
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:47,535
Jefferson School Science Fair,
Madolyn and Quinn Ramsey.

53
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,805
Congratulations.

54
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,839
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

55
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,413
<i>Station,</i>
<i>this is Houston.</i>

56
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,248
<i>We did not copy your last.</i>

57
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,718
Station, I repeat,
confirm thrusters.

58
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,586
This is an actual.

59
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,822
Station,
Control computers are online.

60
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,525
Confirming satellite
relay status.

61
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,860
Maybe it's just
another software glitch.

62
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:17,431
ISS installed an OPNAV assembly
for Moon imagery collection.

63
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,901
That onboard camera system
should be live.

64
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,636
Patch in. We may be able to see

65
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,970
if the station
has started shifting course.

66
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,572
Got it.

67
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:28,375
Space Track
at emergency threat level.

68
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,912
Object on course to station,
critical radius.

69
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,648
230 kilometers and closing.

70
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,616
Station, this is Houston.

71
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,284
Near-Earth object on approach.

72
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,986
I repeat,
confirm thruster engageme--

73
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,357
Station, we did
not copy your last.

74
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,393
N.E.O. on approach!

75
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,564
I have OPNAV camera system
on three-second delay.

76
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,865
It was too early
to move Ramsey

77
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,800
off the TOPO console to FDO.

78
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,837
There's no change
in the OPNAV POV.

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,706
They aren't moving.

80
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,474
CapCom, why can't they hear us?

81
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,509
<i>We have incoming.</i>

82
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,013
<i>Critical systems failure!</i>

83
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,548
My God.

84
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,351
We've lost ISS.

85
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,877
OTC, This is the U.S.S.
<i>Colossus</i> in position alpha.

86
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,044
Awaiting COMEX.

87
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,714
<i>Copy that. Initiating COMEX.</i>

88
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,684
General quarters.
General quarters.

89
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:44,952
This is a drill.

90
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,054
All hands,
man your battle stations.

91
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:50,357
COMEX order initiated.
COMEX order initiated.

92
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:55,495
Commence
enemy-hunting exercises.

93
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,765
We play to win.

94
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,774
This can't be right.

95
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:10,945
Target submarine no longer
maintaining safe depth,

96
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,780
and it's on approach.

97
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,117
What do you mean, "on approach"?

98
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,785
Colombian Navy understands

99
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,987
the rules
of our warfare exercises.

100
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,657
<i>Mayday!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

101
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,692
<i>It's a creature!</i>

102
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,695
Did he just say, "creature"?

103
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,431
Scanners showing a very large...

104
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,534
unidentified object...

105
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,839
coming at us at 50 knots.

106
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,007
Whatever it is,
Captain, it is--

107
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,077
it is no Colombian Naval sub.

108
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,412
Get a target lock,
and ready missiles.

109
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:49,382
All hands, this is
Lieutenant Commander Webb.

110
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,786
This is not a drill.
This is not a drill.

111
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,855
General quarters.
General quarters.

112
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,923
All hands,
man your battle stations.

113
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:57,424
Condition red.

114
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,661
Inbound unidentified
submerged hostile.

115
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,131
Up and forward, starboard side.

116
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,867
Down and aft on the port side.

117
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,802
Approaching outer marker range.

118
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:09,904
Target up, Captain.

119
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,405
Sink it...

120
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,742
immediately.

121
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,421
Confirm detonation battery.

122
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,027
Bogy incoming, starboard.

123
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,830
All stations, open fire!

124
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,831
Open fire!

125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,801
Sit report.

126
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,837
Commander,
the hull's been breached.

127
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,171
We're going down.

128
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,876
All hands...

129
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,979
this is
Lieutenant Commander Webb.

130
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:54,715
Abandon ship without delay.

131
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,183
Abandon ship.

132
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,854
I want everyone accounted for.

133
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,929
<i>Abandon ship.</i>

134
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,964
<i>I repeat, abandon ship.</i>

135
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,006
What is that thing?

136
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,908
Jesus Christ,
look at the size of it!

137
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,843
Looks like
a goddamn piranha fish.

138
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,479
Get to the boats, port side. Go!

139
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,849
Starboard is FUBAR.

140
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,084
Move it.

141
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,186
Captain, it's eating
the goddamn ship.

142
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,188
I said, "Move it."
That's an order.

143
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:50,738
Get off my ship!

144
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,219
Yes, Mr. President.

145
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,888
That is my understanding
at this time.

146
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:12,193
But NEOWISE,
Mauna Kea, and CNEOS

147
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,096
all missed this thing
before it was too late.

148
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,231
And I certainly
do share your concern

149
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,600
about the loss of further...

150
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,903
sensitive near-space assets.

151
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,709
I have the ISS Flight Director

152
00:08:28,743 --> 00:08:31,112
in my office at this moment
for debrief.

153
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,083
Yes, sir.

154
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,658
Quinn, what the hell
happened up there?

155
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,961
How can every department
that NASA tasked

156
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,963
to find these things
miss this one?

157
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:53,234
Space Track was able
to locate the N.E.O.

158
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:57,738
with enough time to warn ISS to
maneuver out of its trajectory.

159
00:08:57,772 --> 00:08:59,073
So why didn't it?

160
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,609
Communication
between Houston and the ISS

161
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,645
was interrupted,
but that happens on occasion.

162
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,180
- We lost a relay satellite--
- Look...

163
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,816
I understand it's not uncommon
to lose contact

164
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,952
with the space station,
but to do so

165
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,256
moments before the impact
of a near-Earth object?

166
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,059
Quinn, that's not a coincidence.

167
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:21,595
We don't yet know what it is.

168
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,631
NASA, ESA, CSA,

169
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,366
they've all launched
separate investigations.

170
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,934
Does anyone have any idea

171
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,769
where this thing
originated from?

172
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,705
I have been answering
questions about this

173
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,141
for nine hours straight
at NASA HQ.

174
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,310
If I knew anything else,
I would tell you.

175
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:42,249
What we do know
is CNEOS confirmed...

176
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:44,085
that it just...

177
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,753
came out of nowhere.

178
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,323
Tell me how something this large
appears out of thin air.

179
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:53,060
I get daily briefings
from the DIA on new

180
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:56,897
and emerging counter space
capabilities of foreign nations,

181
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,667
and each and every one of them
pose a serious threat

182
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,137
to the United States
and its allies' interests.

183
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,905
Space is quickly becoming

184
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,008
the next theater
of combat operations.

185
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:12,746
We may have a national
security matter on our hands,

186
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,415
and I expect
complete cooperation

187
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,317
from you and everyone
in your department.

188
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,653
What, you don't think I want
to know what happened up there?

189
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,322
After all of the criticism I got

190
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,757
for being the youngest
Flight Director in history

191
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,126
to lead Mission Control?

192
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,963
Sure made history, all right.

193
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,301
Quinn, no one's
blaming you for anything.

194
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:39,974
Ramsey.

195
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,010
Yes, sir.

196
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,112
What--Is everything okay?

197
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,215
I need to clear
the room, please.

198
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,950
I'll arrange
your travel back to Houston

199
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:51,252
as quickly as possible.

200
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,288
Thanks, Dad.

201
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,758
I can get myself home.

202
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,732
Yes, sir. Sorry.

203
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,806
We've got to stop
scheduling tastings

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,341
with wedding caterers
on our lunch break.

205
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,910
My meeting with
the Office of Investigation

206
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,244
is in five minutes, and I still

207
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,879
haven't printed out
the spreadsheets.

208
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,048
Well, at least we didn't spend
an hour and a half

209
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,383
bickering over where to eat.

210
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,151
- Ha! That was funny.
- Was good, right?

211
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,853
I just thought of that
off the top--

212
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,254
Not to mention accurate.
Did you drop off

213
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:28,956
the rent check this morning
before you left?

214
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,457
Yes. Check dropped off.
Hey, I got time.

215
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,326
I can help you prep
for your IO meeting.

216
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,861
Fine.

217
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,963
Knew there was a reason
I decided to marry you.

218
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:37,965
What's that reason again?

219
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,166
Just so--Just so--For me.

220
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,108
Yeah. Good.

221
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,847
Cool. Thank you.

222
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:58,252
All right. Let's look here.

223
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,221
That...

224
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:01,822
Hey, hon...

225
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,424
are these
the viewership data metrics

226
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:07,795
for, um, Q2 on the Dbop
streaming service platform?

227
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,464
- Yeah. OI plans
to review the data

228
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,801
related to this indie film
company called The Asylum.

229
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,036
They're infamous
for crappy monster movies.

230
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,172
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. What--

231
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,174
What are you
talking about, "crappy"?

232
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,876
Honey, they made <i>Sharknado.</i>

233
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,278
The <i>Sharkna</i> movies.

234
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,046
It's money.

235
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,314
I'm talking about

236
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,316
potential
statistics manipulation.

237
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,452
- Huh.
- Or does it reflect

238
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,320
organic consumer behavior?

239
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:36,558
They had 81 films
on the Top 100 list

240
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,826
on the Dbop platform
this last quarter.

241
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,194
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,929
It's all coming from
their streaming network,

243
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,330
The Asylum Movie Channel.

244
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,932
Oh, my gosh.
I've seen all these.

245
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,368
<i>Mega Shark</i>
<i>vs. Giant Octopus.</i> Great.

246
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,436
<i>Planet of the Sharks,</i> classic.

247
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,507
<i>San Andreas Mega Quake.</i>
I cried twice.

248
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,975
<i>Triassic World.</i>
<i>Sharknado</i> movies, of course.

249
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,910
<i>Elvis Lives!</i>
I mean, these are great.

250
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,879
When are you
watching this stuff?

251
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:03,384
Uh, usually when you--
after you go to bed, so...

252
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,587
Maybe you're the reason
for the, uh, trend.

253
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,954
Started in the first quarter

254
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,490
with 61 titles
on the top 100 list.

255
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:11,526
What? By what metric?

256
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,093
Two minutes viewed?
Ten minutes viewed?

257
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,929
No, all the Asylum movies
saw the biggest increase

258
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,565
in millions of minutes viewed,

259
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,534
more than any other
film or TV content

260
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,235
in the whole six-month period.

261
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,203
No, no, this has
gotta be like a--

262
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,239
like a marketing gimmick, right?
Like a publicity stunt.

263
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,241
I mean, you know
what kind of films they make.

264
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,376
Um, they made
a sequel to <i>Titanic.</i>

265
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,912
No, they made
two sequels to <i>Titanic.</i>

266
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,549
It's a--It's a publicity stunt.
I wouldn't put it past them.

267
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,183
Oh, I thought the same thing,

268
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,019
but that would explain
a spike in one or two films.

269
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,487
This is different.

270
00:13:40,522 --> 00:13:42,956
If they're
profiting off of this,

271
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,626
then it's
some get-rich-quick scam,

272
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:48,563
but they are no strangers
to, uh, lawsuits.

273
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,297
Hmm. Okay, it says here

274
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:54,468
an average 74% increase
in repeat viewings,

275
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:58,872
60% increase in combined
hours watched for Q2.

276
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:02,042
I mean, either this content's
more popular than ever,

277
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:04,612
or it's fraudulent statistics.

278
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:07,081
- Hmm.
- Oh. I gotta go.

279
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,182
They're waiting.

280
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,316
- Okay. Bye.
- Thank you. Love you.

281
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,984
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

282
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,386
Who the heck's been
watching <i>MegaBoa</i>

283
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,988
and <i>6-Headed Shark</i>
that many times in a row?

284
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,624
Break a leg.

285
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:17,925
Why did--

286
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,226
I get if it's <i>Bachelor Night.</i>

287
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,928
That movie was...

288
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,030
Actually that movie
was a work of art, actually.

289
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,936
Hey.

290
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,672
How'd it go?

291
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,574
Ah, about as well
as you can expect.

292
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,108
A marathon
of closed-door sessions

293
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:35,577
with NASA leadership to go.

294
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:37,612
But I have news.

295
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

296
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,082
JPL and the Planetary
Defense Coordination Office

297
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,384
reviewed footage from all

298
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,153
of their ground
and space-based telescopes.

299
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:49,957
Now, PDCO found
something we missed.

300
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,259
There was
a second object in orbit,

301
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,994
small enough
that nobody would tell,

302
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,029
but on the same trajectory,

303
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,532
and dropped out of sight
just seconds

304
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,967
after the asteroid
was picked up by Space Track.

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,236
Does that--
How big are we talking here?

306
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,072
PDCO believes it's
about 1.6 meters across,

307
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,574
but no one would see it,
because it approached

308
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,175
on the daylight side
of the Earth

309
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,443
from the direction of the sun.

310
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,145
So what else
do they know about it?

311
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,582
Well, PDCO says it's definitely
an artificial object.

312
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:17,050
Now, it was dwarfed in size
by the asteroid,

313
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,086
but it wasn't
some piece of space junk

314
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,656
or a defunct satellite
that fell out of trajectory.

315
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,691
Look, we wouldn't
have even seen the thing

316
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,660
if it hadn't come
so damn close to the Earth.

317
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:28,996
JPL and the PDCO
are both positive

318
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,132
that the smaller object
preceded the second one,

319
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,968
impacting com satellites
in our constellation.

320
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,103
Wait. Wait a minute.

321
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,306
PDCO believes
that the second object

322
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,708
made impact with our satellites?

323
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:41,975
Yes.

324
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,745
Okay, that might fit
the timeline

325
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,446
for Mission Control
losing contact

326
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,482
and the asteroid
making impact with ISS.

327
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:50,217
Yeah.

328
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,493
What is that?

329
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,335
What is that?

330
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,711
What is...

331
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:19,747
Oh.

332
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:21,482
Honey, d-did you see it?

333
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,383
No. I just got out
of my meeting.

334
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,386
There's--There's a drone
hovering over Manhattan.

335
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,288
It's making this--
this weird noise.

336
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,091
There it is. I see it.

337
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,359
Oh, wow.

338
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,361
It's putting on
some kind of light show.

339
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,574
It's coming back.

340
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,141
It's coming back this way!

341
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,097
Is that a...

342
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,298
I...

343
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,137
Aaron, honey,
we gotta get out of here.

344
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,673
- Come on.
- Yeah. Okay, okay.

345
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,552
Come on. We gotta go.

346
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,689
I understand. We're evacuating
the building right now.

347
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,861
Sir, we need to get you to
a secure location immediately.

348
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,697
That was the director
of the Secret Service.

349
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,731
He just informed me--

350
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,399
The Capitol is down.

351
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,768
Article One, Section Two

352
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,771
designates you
as the acting president.

353
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,506
I got <i>Marine One</i> waiting.

354
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,240
I need to get you
to Mount Weather.

355
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,176
Sir, we need to leave now.

356
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,849
- Dad.
- Quinn.

357
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,585
They're moving me
to a secure location.

358
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,452
Dad. This is Jerry Ford,

359
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,622
CapCom for my team
at Mission Control.

360
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,756
Sir.

361
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,158
Tom, we have to go.

362
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,459
- We have to go.
- Okay.

363
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,706
Okay.

364
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:25,873
We're clear. Take off.

365
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,910
The director
of the Secret Service

366
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,879
said that there's been sightings
of UAVs on the National Mall.

367
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:35,415
I saw it. W-We both did.

368
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,384
I-It flew over
Virginia Highlands Park

369
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,486
and into Washington, D.C.

370
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,191
I-It was cylindrical in shape,
about five feet across,

371
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,226
made an awful humming sound.

372
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,362
And then there was
some red light or beam

373
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,430
that came out of it,
projected on everyone,

374
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,899
and then it just disappeared.

375
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,433
We thought
it was gonna kill us,

376
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,936
and who knows? It might.

377
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:58,606
I mean, Lord knows what level
of radiation that thing had.

378
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,376
How does that correlate with
the intel we've gathered so far?

379
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,477
The same.

380
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,478
There have been
similar sightings

381
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:06,179
over Los Angeles, New York,

382
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,449
Chicago, Houston, London, Paris.

383
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,619
But what the heck
are they doing here?

384
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,860
Jesus.

385
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,261
I mean,
look at that son of a bitch.

386
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:51,759
Something like
those creatures down there...

387
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,362
attacked the U.S.S. <i>Colossus</i>

388
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,832
off the coast of Colombia.

389
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,668
That's privileged information.

390
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,370
Ship was destroyed, sunk.

391
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,875
She's listed as missing,
presumed...

392
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:09,610
No. No, no, no.

393
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:10,945
She's too much
of a control freak.

394
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,246
She's not gonna die
without dictating

395
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,516
exactly how and
when it happens, down--

396
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,884
Quinn, that's enough!

397
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:19,620
I won't have you
mocking her like this.

398
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:30,665
I stood by hoping that
the two of you would reconcile,

399
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:33,668
because it wasn't
my place to be involved,

400
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,937
but if you have
unresolved issues,

401
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,239
that doesn't give you
an excuse to act like this.

402
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,274
Sir...

403
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:44,946
it's time to take
the oath of office.

404
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,346
They can witness.

405
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,952
Wait. He could do that here?

406
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:52,385
Without the Chief Justice?

407
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,489
Yeah. LBJ did it
on <i>Air Force One</i>

408
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,290
when JFK was assassinated.

409
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,327
The Constitution, Article Two,

410
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,998
does not stipulate
who administers it.

411
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:17,344
I, Thomas Ramsey, do solemnly
swear to faithfully execute

412
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:21,516
the office of the President
of the United States of America,

413
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,586
to preserve, protect,
and defend the Constitution

414
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,522
of the United States
of America,

415
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,056
so help me, God.

416
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,559
All right.

417
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,766
That's it. Th-That's the drone,
like the one before.

418
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:05,026
Oh, my God.

419
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,928
It took out both choppers.

420
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:11,098
We've been hit!

421
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:14,401
Oh, crap. That sound
means we're going down.

422
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,736
- Brace for impact.
- How do you know?!

423
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,505
Look, I've flown
enough of these things

424
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:18,840
to know when we're going down.

425
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:19,841
Brace for impact, sir.

426
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,554
Jerry didn't make it.

427
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,447
Quinn, don't move.

428
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,555
Quinn, don't move. Don't move.

429
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,062
<i>You always did suck</i>
<i>at hide-and-go-seek, Quinn.</i>

430
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,899
Madolyn?

431
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,700
Is that you, Madolyn?

432
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,876
That fight must have
damaged both the robots.

433
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,444
It's not responding
to any more of my commands.

434
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:32,780
Stupid thing
just crapped out on me.

435
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,550
Dad, are you okay?

436
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,652
- I'm--
- Is anything broken?

437
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,787
I'm fine. What happened?

438
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,155
The Navy said you were missing.

439
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,124
I-I saw the footage!

440
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,626
Yeah, I...

441
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,230
- Uh...
- Hey.

442
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,463
Hey.

443
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,134
Sorry.

444
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,505
Glad you're still alive.

445
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,107
Thanks.

446
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,142
- Yeah.
- Same.

447
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:04,145
Lieutenant Commander Webb.

448
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:06,681
You were 48 hours away

449
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:08,683
from being declared
officially dead.

450
00:24:08,716 --> 00:24:11,585
And I was prepared
to go down with my ship, sir.

451
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:12,787
I don't remember what happened.

452
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,922
I just got thrown overboard

453
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,624
and was picked up
by a fishing trawler

454
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,559
some nine miles out
from where we sank.

455
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,161
Ended up in Cali, Colombia,

456
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:21,896
and took a short flight
over to Bogota,

457
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,966
which was soon under attack
by that thing.

458
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,701
That robot?

459
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,503
Yeah.

460
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:32,640
The Colombian military
took it down, and, uh...

461
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,976
I snuck in and took it.

462
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,511
I had heard reports
that D.C. was under attack,

463
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,846
and I had seen firsthand

464
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,848
what one of those creatures
could do to my ship,

465
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,817
so I decided
I needed an upgrade.

466
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,454
You know, those things can fly.

467
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,823
Nearly killed myself trying.

468
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,058
That looks like our ride.

469
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,807
Mr. President, welcome
to High Point Special Facility.

470
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:09,043
I'm Special Agent Lucy Taggart
of the Secret Service.

471
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:11,779
I've been assigned lead
of your protective detail.

472
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:14,281
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff,
Nick Forster,

473
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,283
Lieutenant Commander
Madolyn Webb,

474
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,552
and Dr. Quinn Ramsey of NASA.

475
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,288
Mr. President. Greg Stern,
Federal Protective Services.

476
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:24,225
On behalf of my entire team
and department, welcome.

477
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:26,093
Thank you.

478
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:29,296
How many citizens can we
accommodate in this facility?

479
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,598
Several thousand, sir.

480
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,867
Very good.
I want to open this site

481
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,835
to displaced citizens
from the surrounding counties.

482
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,604
Sir, this facility--

483
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:39,640
It's a high-end military and
civilian relocation center,

484
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,675
and it's a FEMA command center,

485
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:44,078
but, Nick, it doesn't
mean a good goddamn

486
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:49,083
if we can't provide shelter and
aid to those who need it most.

487
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:51,685
Now, we've got plenty
of room here, right, Greg?

488
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,686
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

489
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,788
I'm gonna turn this over

490
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,022
to the Federal
Protection Services

491
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:56,590
to work out the details.

492
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:57,925
Yes, sir.
I'll work with Agent Taggart.

493
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,260
We'll get it done for you, sir.

494
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,294
Very good.

495
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,025
I apologize, Dr. Ramsey.
I can't let you in.

496
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:33,327
The president's on the phone
with the German chancellor.

497
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,296
Where's the Joint Chief?

498
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:43,771
This has been a day
of unprecedented challenges

499
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:45,339
that we don't
even understand fully,

500
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:49,076
concerning the terrestrial
and marine organisms.

501
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,379
Now, as of an hour ago,

502
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:54,982
some have been destroyed,

503
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:58,719
but several are still causing
catastrophic damage

504
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,222
and, so far,
thousands of casualties.

505
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,959
We just found out
10 minutes ago,

506
00:27:04,992 --> 00:27:10,064
a giant snake tried to eat half
a subway train in Tokyo, Japan.

507
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,199
Sir, excuse me.

508
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,001
A snake attacked a train?

509
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:17,905
Exactly. Shut down
the whole metro system.

510
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:22,743
Thousands are trapped in trains
and--and stations in Tokyo.

511
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,287
Aaron, we can't just sit here

512
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,356
and eavesdrop on--
on radio chatter.

513
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,191
Honey, what do you think
I'm trying to do?

514
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:39,093
All right, look,
we can't blindly drive around

515
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:40,995
looking for a safe place.
There's just--

516
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:42,396
There is no safe place.

517
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:44,999
There's no safe place
in New York.

518
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,934
I mean...

519
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:49,870
not while there's
a giant monster out there. I--

520
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:52,339
Ohh. I mean, everything
we own is in a backpack.

521
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,141
- We need a plan, Aaron.
- Okay.

522
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:55,776
No, honey, don't panic.
Hey, don't panic.

523
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,011
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

524
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,479
We're gonna get
through this together.

525
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,347
You're acting like this is
just another Friday night.

526
00:28:00,381 --> 00:28:04,285
There--There is
a giant crocodile,

527
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:06,820
a-and a massive shark
just attacked New York,

528
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,322
L.A., Washington.

529
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,025
I mean, a giant snake in Japan?

530
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,127
I can't believe these words
are coming out of my mouth.

531
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,395
Honey, don't panic.

532
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:15,763
We will get through this
together.

533
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:16,797
We just need a plan.

534
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,898
We're gonna figure...

535
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,134
We're gonna...

536
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,772
Aaron, what is it?

537
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:30,010
Honey, do you have
the spreadsheets on you?

538
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,845
Yeah.

539
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,847
How--How does
that have any bearing

540
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,482
with our situation right now?

541
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:37,885
Just, uh--Just--Just--

542
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,155
No, this--No, no, no.

543
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,456
This can't be right.

544
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:44,858
Um...

545
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:49,163
<i>Crocosaurus,</i>
<i>Mega Shark, MegaBoa.</i>

546
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:51,832
Oh, my God. This--
This can't possibly be real.

547
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,068
What--What is happening? Um...

548
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,869
Okay, um, honey,

549
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:58,405
uh, just promise me
you won't freak out, okay?

550
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,441
You're--
You're scaring me.

551
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,142
- Okay, okay, just--
- What is happ--

552
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:05,412
All of the monsters
that we're seeing

553
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,481
are from the movies
on this list.

554
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:10,918
I know, I know, but they're
all appearing right here,

555
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,853
even in this order so far.

556
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,422
And this is happening right now.

557
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:18,492
Eh, no.

558
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:19,994
Y-Yes. Yes. Okay--

559
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:21,395
- No, that--
- I know you're freaking out.

560
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,430
- You sound insane, honey.
- I'm freaking out.

561
00:29:23,464 --> 00:29:25,065
Th-That's crazy.

562
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:27,234
We have to tell somebody, okay?
We have to go now.

563
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,570
We have to tell somebody
what's happening,

564
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,905
because this is on the list.

565
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:33,841
Okay, okay. I know.
I know it sounds nuts.

566
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,342
- Ugh.
- I know it sounds crazy,

567
00:29:35,376 --> 00:29:38,946
but I think this is the play,
so just can--can I drive?

568
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:41,583
No. No, absolutely not.

569
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,518
Where--Where do you
think we're going?

570
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:44,918
Can I...

571
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,154
No. I'm driving.

572
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,322
All right.

573
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:53,861
While our understanding
of these creatures is limited,

574
00:29:53,894 --> 00:29:55,195
Lieutenant Commander Webb here

575
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:57,599
has engaged them
on two separate occasions.

576
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,966
Lieutenant Commander.

577
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:03,904
Thank you, Admiral.

578
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:07,341
First thing to know is
that they are vulnerable.

579
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,109
They can be defeated.

580
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:12,146
They also seem to come
in two different forms,

581
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,016
organic, which appear
to be gigantic mutations and--

582
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,153
crocodile, an octopus, a snake,

583
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:21,455
like what attacked D.C., Tokyo,

584
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,891
and my ship
in the Colombian sea.

585
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,359
The other is synthetic,

586
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:30,130
which so far, appear to be
in the form of giant robots,

587
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,965
one of which
I was able to commandeer.

588
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,300
Hold up.

589
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,403
You piloted a giant robot?

590
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:37,605
Like, for real?

591
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:41,175
Yeah. When I fought
the other one, yeah.

592
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:44,011
So who was
piloting the other one?

593
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:47,915
Nobody. Seemed to be running on
some sort of advanced AI system.

594
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:50,150
Let me
get this straight.

595
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,621
We're under attack
by mutant fish,

596
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:56,624
wildlife, and Skynet?

597
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,526
At the same time?

598
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,529
Yeah. Why not just pick one?

599
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:05,032
It took just one
of those creatures

600
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,634
to sink a U.S. Navy warship

601
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:09,103
and kill 99 of my men and women.

602
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,640
The organics have shown

603
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:15,577
incredible aggression
and strength

604
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,581
unlike anything the military
has ever faced before.

605
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,516
The synthetics,
on the other hand,

606
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,984
I believe that they
can be reprogrammed.

607
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,392
This is Dr. Ramsey from NASA.

608
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,261
Excuse us.

609
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:39,366
I collected blood samples
from the mega piranha

610
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,268
off of Madolyn's uniform.

611
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:45,072
It appears to be
extraterrestrial.

612
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,076
These things are aliens?

613
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:52,112
The drone. Um, every time
one of those creatures attacked,

614
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,649
a drone was seen flying nearby.

615
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:56,584
So are we to assume
that those drones

616
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,586
are extraterrestrial as well?

617
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,422
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

618
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:04,526
A-A Navy chopper
shot one of the drones down.

619
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,394
I-I need to go there,
and hopefully it's still intact.

620
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,264
Quinn, I will send
an extraction team instead.

621
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:12,332
No, no, no.
I-I need to go there.

622
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,735
I need--I need to look at it.

623
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:16,437
I need to see how it works.
I need to figure it out.

624
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,606
A-An extraction team isn't
gonna know what to look for.

625
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,308
You don't know
what you're looking for.

626
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,043
You run Mission Control.

627
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:25,345
What do you know
about alien tech?

628
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,414
The extraction team
will bring back

629
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,082
whatever there is to bring back,

630
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,752
but I've got a call
in 10 minutes

631
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:32,453
with the Japanese
Prime Minister

632
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:34,689
to reassure him
that our alliances

633
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:37,525
and cooperation
on global security

634
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,028
extend naturally to the possible
invasion from another world.

635
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,030
- Excuse me.
- Under--Understood, sir.

636
00:32:48,335 --> 00:32:50,738
How would you know
anything about me, Madolyn?

637
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:55,275
You don't know the first thing
about me or what I'm capable of.

638
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,078
Which is just how you wanted it.

639
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,715
Wrong. It's how you wanted it.

640
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:02,584
Oh, I got the message

641
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:04,017
- loud and clear.
- Mm.

642
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:05,419
You didn't have time
for me anymore.

643
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:08,523
Okay, why is that, exactly?

644
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:11,626
I mean, is it because
I stopped letting you dictate

645
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:14,596
when we were gonna hang out,
how, where?

646
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,363
Okay. Yeah, sorry.

647
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,799
I was just trying
to have a relationship

648
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,266
with my only sister.

649
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,134
And one of us
had to make the effort.

650
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,704
How?

651
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:26,039
By--By making fun of everything
I've ever cared about?

652
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:29,176
That is really, really
making an effort, Madolyn.

653
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,645
Ah, the Fourth of July weekend.

654
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,514
That--That's what you're
talking about, right?

655
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,415
Oh, you love to bring that up
when you want to make a point.

656
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:39,521
Okay, Quinn, yes,
I was lashing out.

657
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:41,455
I was upset.

658
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:46,426
Everything with you
has to be a competition.

659
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,696
I mean, it happened
even when we were younger.

660
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,431
Who got the best grades,
who was better at sports.

661
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:53,801
And you know what?
You never grew out of it.

662
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:56,203
I'm your sister.

663
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:58,305
We were supposed to be a team.

664
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:06,614
You are the person
I shared all my secrets with,

665
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,248
and we would watch--

666
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,552
we would watch
scary movies together

667
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:12,386
that we were too young for. I--

668
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,222
Right.

669
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,359
Best friend?

670
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,260
Yeah, sure.

671
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,431
You know what? I'm done.
I'm done with this.

672
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:28,101
It's--It's obvious that
you and I have grown apart,

673
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:29,771
a-and this is what it is.

674
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,207
Wait, what did you say?

675
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,745
I said we've grown apart.

676
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,212
Yeah, I got that.

677
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,882
I'm talking about
when we were kids,

678
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,750
the movies
that we used to watch.

679
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:47,154
That's where I remember it from.

680
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:49,189
What? Remember what?

681
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,658
The snake attack,

682
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,459
the one in Tokyo.

683
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,696
What are you talking about?

684
00:34:54,729 --> 00:35:00,434
A gigantic snake tried
to eat a subway train in Tokyo.

685
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,469
Okay, when did this happen?

686
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:08,241
It was called
<i>Snakes on a Train.</i>

687
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,778
I know, Quinn. Thank you.

688
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:15,349
The Asylum Movie Channel?

689
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,384
Yeah, why don't you click on it?

690
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,620
Okay.

691
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:26,460
Can you--Slow down.
You're going too fast.

692
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,429
Oh, these are
some interesting titles--

693
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:31,566
<i>Aquarium of the Dead,</i>

694
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,701
<i>Android Cop,</i>

695
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:36,303
<i>Airplanes vs. Volcano.</i>

696
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:38,506
Oof. I wonder
what that one's about.

697
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,876
Guessing a plane
fights a volcano.

698
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,478
My money's on the volcano.

699
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,680
Smart.

700
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,550
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

701
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:50,585
That one. Uh, it's...

702
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:53,220
<i>Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus.</i>

703
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,889
That--That looks exactly

704
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:57,391
like what attacked
the National Mall.

705
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,660
- Does it?
- Yeah.

706
00:35:58,693 --> 00:35:59,694
Hmm.

707
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:02,530
Quinn...

708
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:05,767
that's what attacked my ship.

709
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,480
Simultaneous targets
progressing as expected.

710
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,754
Humans. They are as naive
as they are arrogant.

711
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:33,628
And resilient.

712
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,731
The human impulse for
aggression cannot be ignored.

713
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:39,667
But lacking intelligence.

714
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:41,903
The Chamber of Xeli
verified these chronicles

715
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:45,405
depict human culture
and their mythology,

716
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:48,810
stories of the Earth's
fantastic myths and behemoths

717
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:51,713
rooted in human historical fact.

718
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:53,581
- Hmm.
- Look.

719
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:54,949
Earth was once dominated

720
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:57,719
by an empire
of prehistoric beasts,

721
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:00,922
which then gave the uprise
to an empire of sharks,

722
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:02,924
according
to these human chronicles.

723
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,860
Target next weapons package
to highly populated coordinates.

724
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,361
Targets are ready and assigned.

725
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,770
Maybe it's best
to temper your zeal

726
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,905
for this simple act
of annihilation,

727
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:20,942
or else you may be
called out of stratagem

728
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:22,744
by the Superior.

729
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:26,047
There is nothing simple

730
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,683
in what I'm about
to inflict upon them.

731
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,423
The Superior has summoned you.

732
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:00,447
My review of the vessel's
operations records

733
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,016
show that you have
not yet commenced

734
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,018
Ontogenesis conversions.

735
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:08,321
The approved stratagem
must not be diverted from.

736
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:10,558
We can ill afford deviations
of the stratagem

737
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,492
at a time when victory
is most critical

738
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,427
to the preservation of our race.

739
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:18,933
My Superior, the humans
possess defense capabilities.

740
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,334
They have yet
to engage against us.

741
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:25,372
You were not my first choice.

742
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,608
Your reputation
as a headstrong commander

743
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,510
with a tendency
towards the sadistic

744
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:32,547
has made you a poor candidate
for this campaign,

745
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,415
despite
your qualified war record.

746
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:39,486
But the Chamber of Xeli
has shown favor in you,

747
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,590
so I shall remind you only once.

748
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:46,727
The humans must be spared
at all possible opportunities,

749
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:48,930
or we shall not survive.

750
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:49,997
Is that understood?

751
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,801
Understood, My Superior.

752
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,738
Commence the Ontogenesis phase
on stratagem,

753
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,708
or I shall reassign the command
structure of this vessel.

754
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,027
Well, there's no one around.

755
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:21,829
It's looking shady.

756
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,398
Maybe he's sleeping.

757
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:26,968
Maybe.

758
00:39:31,505 --> 00:39:32,773
All right, who are you,

759
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:34,575
and how'd you find
your way up to my room?

760
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,678
Uh, Field Agent Wilson.

761
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,780
Uh, this is Farmer.

762
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,682
We'd like to speak with you.

763
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,851
Um, those creatures,

764
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,187
they're similar
to the ones that--

765
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,889
You starred in the movies.

766
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:49,857
Uh, we're just hoping

767
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:51,759
you can shed some light
on the subject.

768
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,861
Yeah, sure.
Come on in. I know stuff.

769
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:55,462
- Come on. Come on in.
- O-Okay.

770
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:56,764
- Okay.
- Yeah.

771
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,606
The things that
have been attacking us,

772
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,442
they--they're creatures
from a series of movies

773
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:13,080
from a film studio
called The Asylum.

774
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:16,183
You want
to run that by me again?

775
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:20,154
All right. See this?

776
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,524
This is what happened to
the U.S.S. <i>Colossus,</i> all right?

777
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:25,026
Get a good look.

778
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,595
This is actual size.

779
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,697
But now these things are here.

780
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,731
How is that possible?

781
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,199
We think
it has something to do

782
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,201
with the unidentified drones
that have appeared

783
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:36,137
at each of the incidents.

784
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,806
So then where are
the drones coming from?

785
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,107
Who's sending them?

786
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:43,177
A-A shark this big
has attacked several vessels

787
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,846
and Navy bases
on the Eastern Seaboard.

788
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,015
Navy intelligence seems to think

789
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:51,719
that, uh, it's part of
just being territorial, right?

790
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,789
Everything's been focused around
Virginia Beach and Norfolk.

791
00:40:54,822 --> 00:40:56,958
It's like it's
protecting a boundary.

792
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:59,660
That's only
about three hours from here.

793
00:40:59,694 --> 00:41:02,163
I mean, maybe that's where
the drones are coming from.

794
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:04,632
How do we kill that?

795
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:23,818
So where we're going
is an honest-to-God

796
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:26,787
top-secret federal facility.

797
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:28,522
I kid you not.

798
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:31,292
In fact, they probably won't
even let us in the place.

799
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:34,128
They're probably gonna tell us
that there's nobody there.

800
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,098
But you know what?
Do not believe them.

801
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,700
I was up for the part
of a double agent

802
00:41:39,734 --> 00:41:41,736
in a Chris Nolan film.

803
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:44,005
You know Chris Nolan?
Good director, man.

804
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:46,140
Good friend, too.

805
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,075
Anyway, so you know
how I like to--

806
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:50,211
I like to get into the part,
you know,

807
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:52,279
so, uh, I tried
to break into this place.

808
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,914
Uh, what happened?

809
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:55,683
Oh, they caught me.

810
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:58,319
But that's cool, because
I used it in the audition.

811
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:01,622
You know, you gotta
set the stakes really high.

812
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,658
As long as we're not driving
for five hours for no reason.

813
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:08,129
Not a waste of time, kids.
I'm telling you.

814
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,864
But this is the real deal.

815
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:11,599
Yeah, yeah.
It is a real place.

816
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:13,567
They even shoot
a lot of episodes of TV here.

817
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,703
They shot the second season
of <i>Z Natio</i> here,

818
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,705
which is
a great show by the way. Um...

819
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,207
Yeah. You see?
Boyfriend here gets it.

820
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,681
- Um...
- May I help you?

821
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:29,350
We're from the FCC,

822
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:31,819
and I know this is
gonna sound odd,

823
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:33,154
but we have information

824
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,890
that we think might be
of use, at least we hope.

825
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:37,958
What kind of information?

826
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:40,594
Uh, information
about the Dbop streaming app

827
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:42,329
for The Asylum's
movie channel.

828
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:44,665
You said you're from the FCC?

829
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,167
You have any credentials
to back that up?

830
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,868
Yeah. Yeah.

831
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,336
Oh. Yeah.

832
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,038
Just one second.

833
00:42:58,179 --> 00:42:59,180
Field Agent, huh?

834
00:43:00,948 --> 00:43:03,117
- Yeah, New York office.
- Mm-hmm.

835
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,754
Okay, um...

836
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:09,723
so this is the list
of all The Asylum titles.

837
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:11,392
I mean, there's been, like,

838
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,894
a 74% increase in--
in repeat viewings

839
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:16,797
and 60% increase
in the combined hours viewed.

840
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,133
- Okay, okay, hold on.
Relax, okay?

841
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,936
Sir, it's like she said.

842
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,105
We may be able to be
of some service to you

843
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,273
in this time
of national emergency.

844
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:31,011
We didn't drive five hours
to waste your time or ours.

845
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:32,113
Okay.

846
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,147
Officer Stern.

847
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,816
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

848
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,751
These, uh, individuals

849
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,787
say they have
some information for us.

850
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,322
They did actually mention

851
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,991
the movie studio
by name, though.

852
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,329
That one, Secret Service.

853
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,264
President must be here.

854
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:51,732
How do you know?

855
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:52,967
Look at her right hand.

856
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,735
See that scar?

857
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,670
That's from a rubber bullet.

858
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:58,072
They have to train with them.

859
00:43:58,105 --> 00:44:00,374
They get shot with them
in Secret Service training.

860
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,676
They try to shoot at the limbs,

861
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,912
you know, so as
not to cause any damage.

862
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:07,715
Yeah, I got one.

863
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:10,017
Same scar, yeah.

864
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,052
Yeah, we were
up for the same role,

865
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,054
me and Clint,
<i>In the Line of Fire.</i>

866
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:16,690
I started training early.

867
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,960
Yeah. They--
They went with older.

868
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,897
That's how it is
in Hollywood sometimes.

869
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,298
You're that actor.

870
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,433
Yeah, I thought
I recognized you.

871
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,335
Can I help you?

872
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,738
I think we
may be able to help you.

873
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:34,909
These FCC agents have
put together a-a line of clues

874
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,411
that I think
may give you an idea

875
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:40,214
of what's causing all these
problems that you're having.

876
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:42,016
Okay.

877
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:45,219
They do have active FCC I.D.s.

878
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:46,954
Run it through cross-check.

879
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,189
Corporal, run this for me.

880
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,957
We're being attacked

881
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:52,793
by monsters
from movies on this list.

882
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,329
The creatures
that attacked us

883
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,465
have been following
the order on this list.

884
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,234
There's a list? What order?

885
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,402
Yeah, look at this list,

886
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:03,370
The Asylum titles
from the top down.

887
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:04,939
We know
about their movies,

888
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:07,474
but do you know
about their order?

889
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:11,245
These creatures and events
have happened already.

890
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:12,413
Okay. <i>Asteroid-a-geddon.</i>

891
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:13,480
Remember that one?

892
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:15,883
It's a--It's a big asteroid

893
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,419
collides with the
International Space Station.

894
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:20,454
Okay. Uh, all right.

895
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:21,922
<i>Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus.</i>

896
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:23,257
It's self-explanatory.

897
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,159
Uh, two attacks, both attacks,

898
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:26,327
one in New York and L.A.

899
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,895
Washington, D.C.

900
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,830
That's-- <i>Megaboa.</i> Yeah.

901
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,865
On the news, it said
one showed up in Japan.

902
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,172
<i>Asteroid-a-geddon.</i>

903
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:41,308
An asteroid collides with
the International Space Station

904
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:42,343
and its satellites.

905
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,411
So why didn't it just hit us?

906
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:48,983
I mean, you only need one
asteroid to wipe out humanity.

907
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,186
Is there any way
to determine...

908
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,822
who watches these?

909
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:57,124
That might give us a clue
in who's behind all this.

910
00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:00,261
And by the way, we still have

911
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:02,429
a gigantic prehistoric shark
on the loose.

912
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,367
The way to kill a mega shark

913
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,935
is with a mecha shark.

914
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:09,803
I ought to know.
I was in the movie.

915
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,272
That's how we did it.

916
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:12,806
A mecha shark?

917
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,942
Yeah. Yeah, a mecha shark.

918
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:16,377
It's a giant submarine,

919
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,513
all equipped
with special weapons,

920
00:46:18,546 --> 00:46:19,514
special tactics.

921
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:21,415
That's how we did it.

922
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:23,484
Oh, hey, guys...

923
00:46:23,518 --> 00:46:25,819
this next title on the list...

924
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,023
we got a new problem.

925
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,294
Six of them, actually.

926
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:45,205
Continue on your present course
headed northeast, three miles.

927
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,907
When those creatures
cross paths,

928
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,242
they're gonna
turn on each other.

929
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:50,244
Yeah, and if this
doesn't work, then what?

930
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:52,547
That poor pig
is gonna be lunch.

931
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:33,954
Humans successfully
lured the weapons

932
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,289
to clash with one another.

933
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:37,559
How is this possible?!

934
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:39,226
The humans
were too well prepared

935
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:41,128
for our next weapon
and our attack stratagem.

936
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:43,130
They anticipated it,
and they lured it

937
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,231
and used it against us!

938
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,534
But that is contrary to reason.

939
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:49,036
It would suggest
advanced knowledge

940
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,539
of the stratagem
on their part.

941
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:54,007
I find that explanation
unfathomable.

942
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:58,946
We must engage as if
the humans have gathered

943
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:01,549
sufficient intelligence
in our next stratagem.

944
00:48:03,618 --> 00:48:06,487
Come on, Quinn. Think about it.

945
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:11,225
A massive asteroid
strikes the ISS and sat-coms.

946
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:14,027
Why go through all the trouble
to attack Earth

947
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,996
when that space rock
could have just hit us,

948
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,264
wiped us all out?

949
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:20,067
Okay, but none
of the NASA trajectory models

950
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,036
had Earth
anywhere near its path.

951
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,007
I mean, that's pre- or post-ISS.

952
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,375
What does that mean?

953
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:30,177
It means that the asteroid

954
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,347
was always aimed
at ISS and the satellites.

955
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,348
There was no other path.

956
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:36,083
Yeah, but why not?

957
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:40,555
Okay, PDOC said that there
was a second object

958
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:44,224
that was going along
the same path as the asteroid.

959
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:47,327
Okay, but the asteroid
doesn't hit Earth,

960
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:49,597
which is then under attack.

961
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:52,366
Okay, why not?

962
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:55,169
If the drones
are connected to the attacks,

963
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:57,070
I ask you again, Quinn,

964
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,173
why didn't it just hit us?

965
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,544
I don't know. I don't know.

966
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:04,178
I don't know, Madolyn.

967
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,449
I mean, maybe--maybe it was
never meant to kill us.

968
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:10,083
Uh, yeah, those creatures

969
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,085
have already killed
thousands of us.

970
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,353
Okay, yeah, I know.

971
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:15,122
And look at the rest of us.

972
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,524
We're all in hiding.

973
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:19,493
Easier to kill.

974
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:27,334
Maybe we don't know the true
face of our attacker yet.

975
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:30,204
I mean, without that, we won't
be able to establish motive

976
00:49:30,237 --> 00:49:31,739
or intent for these attacks.

977
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,541
Maybe...

978
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,109
Maybe there's a reason
we're not all dead yet.

979
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,078
I bet you five bucks
you're wrong.

980
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:40,615
"Bet you five bucks..."

981
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:43,383
No, I am not gonna
bet you five bucks.

982
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,720
God, what--Spare me.

983
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:48,422
Spare me the stupid saying
you used to say all the time.

984
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:50,558
What was it? "Play to win."

985
00:49:50,592 --> 00:49:52,727
Is that--something like that.

986
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,796
It's not stupid. That's...

987
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:56,430
It's not stupid.

988
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:59,199
Oh, no, it totally wasn't.

989
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:00,702
You know,
I used to get so mortified

990
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:02,570
when you would
just say it in gym class.

991
00:50:02,604 --> 00:50:05,673
You thought you were so cool.

992
00:50:05,707 --> 00:50:08,175
You were so not.

993
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:11,345
Whatever, Quinn.

994
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:23,056
Uh, did you--
did you bring that?

995
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,592
Of course not.

996
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:26,528
I haven't seen
that thing in years.

997
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:28,830
Thought it got thrown away

998
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:31,365
when Dad moved to Washington.

999
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,801
I would never throw that away.

1000
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,435
Give me that.

1001
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,804
This stays on my desk.

1002
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:39,239
When we had to evacuate,

1003
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:43,711
this is one of the few
personal items I took with me.

1004
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:48,415
You know, this was--this is one
of the proudest days of my life,

1005
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:54,722
watching you two girls develop
and construct that project.

1006
00:50:54,756 --> 00:50:56,758
You thought out
all the precious details,

1007
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,794
and you worked together...

1008
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:02,262
not just like sisters,

1009
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:05,365
but more like,
I don't know, best friends

1010
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,401
that loved each other.

1011
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:11,806
I remember that that was
the ferromagnetic apparatus.

1012
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,074
Yeah, with the penny
and the coat hanger.

1013
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,812
Everybody was so impressed
at the complexity

1014
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:20,582
of the project that
two little girls would choose.

1015
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:28,221
You know, I think it was
my idea to build it first.

1016
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,727
- Quinn.
- I doubt that.

1017
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,862
Yeah, but who can really
remember at this point?

1018
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:40,233
What's going on?

1019
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:41,536
- Sir.
- Sir...

1020
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,236
we should take you
and your family

1021
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,405
to an underground bunker
beyond Main Support Command.

1022
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,407
There's been a sighting
of an unidentified aircraft

1023
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,810
operating at a low altitude.

1024
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:50,645
I suggest we take
precautionary action

1025
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:53,815
until the UAS is confirmed
and controlled.

1026
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,182
Let's go.

1027
00:51:55,215 --> 00:51:57,150
- Sounds like a good idea to me.
- Hup!

1028
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:13,166
Was that another one
of those drones?

1029
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,335
No, that's something bigger,
much bigger.

1030
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:16,504
Well, did the extraction team

1031
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:18,438
pick up the drone
we shot down yet?

1032
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,674
Not as of yet.

1033
00:52:19,707 --> 00:52:21,509
All armed personnel
on the facility

1034
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,243
- are on high alert.
- Hmm.

1035
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:26,848
Sir, with all due respect,
we're gonna need something

1036
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:30,484
a whole lot stronger
and more effective.

1037
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:32,587
Quinn, I want you
to draft a full report

1038
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,321
of the blood analysis
you conducted.

1039
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:38,660
We have to get that info to
the intel agencies as soon as--

1040
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:41,194
Quinn and Madolyn?
What happened?

1041
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:43,665
Please, sir,
remain inside the bunker.

1042
00:52:43,698 --> 00:52:46,901
Officer Stern and I
will locate them.

1043
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,235
We'll find them, sir.

1044
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:51,706
We have a problem.

1045
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,473
Both of the robots
were destroyed in the fight.

1046
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:56,544
Yeah, but we only need one
to get back online.

1047
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,513
Okay. I guess--

1048
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:01,716
I guess the one
that wasn't bashed in the head

1049
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,785
by <i>Marine One</i>
might be our best bet.

1050
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,987
Yeah, well,
the one I was piloting

1051
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,456
just shut down on me,
though, after the fight

1052
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,324
without warning, just kaput.

1053
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,696
So these really aren't built
for close-quarter combat.

1054
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:17,999
Well, yeah, we smashed
each other pretty good,

1055
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:19,534
but I didn't think it was enough

1056
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:21,234
to, like,
shut down the whole rig.

1057
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:25,540
Huh. I wonder if
the artificial synthesis

1058
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:27,675
that--that we found
in the blood on your jacket,

1059
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:32,580
I wonder if the robots share
the same molecular structure.

1060
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,949
What do you mean?
The artificial synthesis

1061
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:36,584
creates a vulnerability
of some sort?

1062
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,887
Yeah, I-I mean, it could
trigger a breakdown

1063
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,924
at the cellular
or molecular level.

1064
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:45,660
O-Okay, wait.
What's breaking them down?

1065
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:48,963
Okay, guys, guys, look. I think,
I mean, at this point...

1066
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:52,800
it's aliens.

1067
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,301
Am I right?

1068
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,937
I'm sure we all noticed
those weird drones

1069
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,371
hovering above the city, right?

1070
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,842
I mean, guys, come on.

1071
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,745
Giant monsters
straight out of the movies,

1072
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:06,514
huh, with
extraterrestrial blood

1073
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,549
and unstable DNA? I mean...

1074
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,819
If I'm following
you guys correctly,

1075
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:14,655
which I think I am,
I think it's just--it's aliens.

1076
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:15,757
I mean, you said it yourself.

1077
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,693
Anytime these drones
appear, right,

1078
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:20,494
one or two or more
of these creatures attack,

1079
00:54:20,528 --> 00:54:22,630
and I--Honestly, I think

1080
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:25,800
it would be safe to assume
that, um, it's these drones

1081
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,002
that are creating
these creatures.

1082
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,304
Creating them how?

1083
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:32,573
That's a good question.

1084
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:35,442
Um, I think--Think of it
like a 3-D printer.

1085
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:37,078
Okay, same idea,

1086
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:41,582
but you need
the correct data file, right?

1087
00:54:41,616 --> 00:54:44,685
And without it,
anything that you're printing

1088
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,088
will essentially--
will have weaknesses

1089
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:49,056
and, um, will fall apart.

1090
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:52,093
Aaron, you don't
actually think

1091
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:54,629
aliens are watching
these movies?

1092
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:56,463
I mean, that's the only thing
that explained

1093
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:57,799
the insane jump in viewership,

1094
00:54:57,832 --> 00:54:59,934
A-And it really
does support your idea

1095
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,804
of, you know,
artificial synthesis, right?

1096
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,439
Okay, so, uh...

1097
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:11,478
when someone or something,
right, streams a movie,

1098
00:55:11,512 --> 00:55:15,448
so the Dbop app sends
a signal to determine...

1099
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,052
what kind of device you're
watching the movie on, right?

1100
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,921
So, for instance,
let's say, I don't know,

1101
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:23,758
you're watching something
in 4K or standard def, right?

1102
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,459
The signal
will stream your movie

1103
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,962
in the proper resolution.

1104
00:55:29,063 --> 00:55:31,132
But if these are aliens,

1105
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:34,969
then they'd have,
like, 16K technology by now,

1106
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:38,005
the highest resolution
in the universe.

1107
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,540
Yes, and you're right, honey.

1108
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:41,642
And let's assume
that they do have that.

1109
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:46,514
But the Dbop app
cannot broadcast in 16K,

1110
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:47,882
and most importantly,

1111
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:51,586
it won't recognize
this new alien technology.

1112
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:57,490
So that means if the signal
doesn't recognize the device,

1113
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,160
it automatically defaults

1114
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:02,763
to load on the poorest
connection quality.

1115
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:06,634
We're talking about a streaming
at poor-quality resolution.

1116
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,435
Let me get this straight.
You're saying

1117
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:14,809
that the--the aliens are
3-D printing these creatures

1118
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:18,411
in low-resolution data
from the Dbop app?

1119
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:20,480
Yes, the lowest
resolution quality

1120
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:21,949
that's visible
on the streaming service.

1121
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,151
And that's what's causing them
to break apart?

1122
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:25,152
Mm-hmm.

1123
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:27,454
That might explain

1124
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,156
the accelerated decomposition.

1125
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,958
So...

1126
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:33,460
the robots are in pieces?

1127
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:36,631
Okay, so if--
if the decomposition

1128
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:41,102
happens at the same rate
of speed as the blood...

1129
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:42,603
But I won't know for sure

1130
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:44,839
until I can see
how those drones operate.

1131
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:48,876
Well, there's gotta be some way

1132
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,545
to at least get
one of them back online.

1133
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:53,514
But it's gonna be
pointless to do that

1134
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,849
unless we can figure out a way

1135
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:56,884
to keep the robots
from--from collapsing

1136
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,519
once we get them back online.

1137
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,490
Electromagnets.

1138
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:06,560
Strong enough to attract
a few thousand pounds of weight

1139
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:08,663
and keep the robot
from collapsing in on itself

1140
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:11,532
when it tries to stand or walk.

1141
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:12,967
And when it tries to fight,

1142
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,502
we'll have to account
for the weight bearing,

1143
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:19,640
impact absorption,
stress-pressure rates,

1144
00:57:19,674 --> 00:57:21,008
punch-speed acceleration.

1145
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,877
Otherwise, it's gonna
be useless in battle.

1146
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,046
Yes, ma'am.

1147
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:26,747
You know, I think
this is the first time

1148
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:28,749
we've agreed on anything
in 10 years.

1149
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:32,186
Oh, I think it's been longer
than that, like 15, maybe.

1150
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:34,889
No, no, no, no. I think
it's probably not that long.

1151
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:37,058
Ah, of course
you would think that.

1152
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:39,226
Well, agree to disagree.

1153
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,695
Apparently
that's what we do best.

1154
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,196
All right!

1155
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:43,931
Let's get to work.

1156
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:55,609
We shot the drone down
on our way here.

1157
00:57:55,643 --> 00:57:57,812
I'm not sure how much of it
is still gonna be intact,

1158
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:00,648
but we need to get
all the pieces we can.

1159
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,883
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm.

1160
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,919
Dr. Ramsey.

1161
00:58:04,952 --> 00:58:06,854
I've come to take you
to the president's bunker.

1162
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,790
No, absolutely not.
We're--We're on our way

1163
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:11,859
to find
some very important tech.

1164
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,260
It's not safe
out there, Doctor.

1165
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:15,763
Then come with us
i-if that's gonna make you

1166
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:18,099
or my father feel better.

1167
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:20,968
Look, I have them.
We could always use more.

1168
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:22,770
There's safety
in numbers, right?

1169
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:26,941
Fine. You know what?

1170
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:28,709
Tell my father
you couldn't find me

1171
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:31,946
or--or that I refused
and I left the facility.

1172
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:32,980
It's up to you.

1173
00:58:34,648 --> 00:58:35,950
Lieutenant Commander Webb's
already departed.

1174
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:37,251
Her team is en route.

1175
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,121
Last chance, Officer.

1176
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:42,623
Do you want to ensure my safety?

1177
00:58:42,656 --> 00:58:43,657
We're moving.

1178
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:47,595
All right. Let me gear up.

1179
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,865
Madolyn...

1180
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:53,534
we're on our way
to recover the drone.

1181
00:58:57,605 --> 00:58:59,106
Copy that, Quinn.

1182
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,075
We're about half a mile
out from the site.

1183
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,345
Be careful out there.

1184
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:05,746
<i>You do the same.</i>

1185
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,722
You got a 20
on Quinn and Madolyn?

1186
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,991
I've been informed
they both left the facility.

1187
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,359
The Lieutenant Commander's
assembled a team

1188
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:20,795
to prepare one of the robots.

1189
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:23,197
Dr. Ramsey went
to get the drone.

1190
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,001
I thought we were sending
the extraction team for that.

1191
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:30,137
We called it off to fortify
the defenses of this facility,

1192
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:34,241
but Dr. Ramsey
thought differently.

1193
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,043
Operation MechaShark

1194
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,746
is in the final stages
of preparation.

1195
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:41,048
Now, the Navy is
almost done retrofitting

1196
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:43,984
active duty and
declassified submarines.

1197
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:45,219
Megalodon is dead.

1198
00:59:45,252 --> 00:59:47,788
No, my mission failed.

1199
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:51,959
Conventional weapons are not
adequate against these things,

1200
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:55,129
and we have to assume there's
going to be another attack.

1201
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,912
No signs of any wreckage yet.

1202
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,116
You sure we're
in the right area?

1203
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:17,184
Yeah. I got
some metal over here.

1204
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:19,386
I'm not sure, but it looks
like it's from the chopper.

1205
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,255
No, that's--
that's from the wreckage.

1206
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:22,857
We're definitely
in the right area.

1207
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:25,860
Hey, hey, get down.
Get down. Get down.

1208
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,332
That's a ship.

1209
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:39,039
They have the drone.

1210
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:40,875
And they look...

1211
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,176
human.

1212
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,253
Damn it. Drone's airborne.

1213
01:00:52,286 --> 01:00:53,954
We're too late.

1214
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:57,057
All right,
let's get back to the facility.

1215
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:58,092
On me.

1216
01:01:19,046 --> 01:01:21,749
Quinn, I'm gonna need...

1217
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:24,752
Where is she?

1218
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:27,221
Damn it.

1219
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:29,089
Put a leash on that girl...

1220
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,457
Come on.

1221
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:10,097
Well, this definitely
isn't one of ours.

1222
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:12,132
That looks good, Gretchen.

1223
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:15,369
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1224
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,539
Now, we've got to keep
these electromagnets strong,

1225
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:19,240
keep the voltage up,
drive high amounts

1226
01:02:19,273 --> 01:02:20,908
of current through it
at all times, okay?

1227
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,376
Okay.

1228
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,378
- Hey, honey.
- I need this.

1229
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:28,749
Yeah.

1230
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:32,520
Hey, hey. Hey. One of--

1231
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,154
One of those drones is back.

1232
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:35,789
The--The beam's
a different color.

1233
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,791
All right, come on.
We can't let it see us.

1234
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:39,159
Let's go.

1235
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:50,137
Oh, man. That's one of the ones
Quinn was trying to retrieve.

1236
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,273
We gotta get
this electromagnetic rig

1237
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:55,075
on this hunk of junk, or we're
gonna be in big trouble.

1238
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:57,945
Quinn, are you there?
I need you to respond.

1239
01:02:57,978 --> 01:02:59,480
Quinn, respond. Over.

1240
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:03,884
Agh!

1241
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:07,888
Wait, wait.
Go this way!

1242
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,890
- We better get out of here.
- This way! Follow me!

1243
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:10,924
Let's go!

1244
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,794
Get away! Come on!

1245
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:16,930
Come on! Go! Keep going!

1246
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:20,267
They usually don't do that.

1247
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:22,303
This way. Go. Come on.

1248
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:31,412
Okay.

1249
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,381
This place looks deserted.

1250
01:03:34,415 --> 01:03:35,583
Okay. Listen.

1251
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:36,884
We--We have to watch out

1252
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:40,020
for mass coronal
ejections, okay?

1253
01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:43,023
Because I doubt the locals
wanted to hit the zoo

1254
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:45,527
with those giant creatures

1255
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,395
wreaking havoc
for 24 hours, right?

1256
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,099
What the hell was that?

1257
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,368
- Let's keep moving.
- Okay.

1258
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:58,072
Damn it! They're in!

1259
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,575
Let's keep moving.
Keep moving.

1260
01:04:11,352 --> 01:04:13,120
Jeez!

1261
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:19,426
The animals are on the loose!

1262
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,595
Something's wrong with it. Wait.

1263
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,331
Get it off, babe!

1264
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,667
- Help me.
- Oh, my God!

1265
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,501
Aaron! No!

1266
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:30,337
No! No!

1267
01:04:30,371 --> 01:04:32,106
No!

1268
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:34,141
- Oh, my God.
- No!

1269
01:04:37,545 --> 01:04:39,046
- He's dead.
- I--

1270
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,447
- I'm not leaving him.
- We've gotta go.

1271
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:42,149
- We gotta go!
- No!

1272
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:47,020
If we don't go, we're all dead.

1273
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,564
Officer Stern, Corporal McKee.

1274
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:32,132
Where are the others?

1275
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,036
Private, where's Dr. Ramsey?

1276
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,309
My mistake.

1277
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:44,546
Uh, Dr. Ramsey's
already returned.

1278
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:01,596
There's still no word
from Madolyn or Quinn.

1279
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:04,599
Nothing yet, Tom.

1280
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,367
But I know
Special Agent Taggart

1281
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:10,270
is in contact with
Officer Stern and his team.

1282
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,479
Madolyn, do you copy?

1283
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:55,415
Okay, now that we've got
all the batteries secured

1284
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,785
to the frame, we're gonna
have to manually rewire

1285
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:00,622
all the components
of the robot that fell apart.

1286
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:02,189
Okay?

1287
01:07:03,457 --> 01:07:05,325
Madolyn, do you copy?

1288
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:17,170
<i>I'm on a transport ship</i>

1289
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:19,641
<i>about three miles offshore.</i>

1290
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:28,148
Madolyn, come in.

1291
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,585
Split up.

1292
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:32,319
Find the evacuees.

1293
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,288
Proceed with
the Ontogenesis phase.

1294
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,490
Find their president.

1295
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:38,158
The humans trust him.

1296
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,794
They'll follow him.

1297
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:41,361
I'll alert the mother ship

1298
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,263
of the stowaway in transport.

1299
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:54,107
What is it, Agent?

1300
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,543
It's time to go from here.

1301
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:08,690
They're aliens, sir.

1302
01:08:08,723 --> 01:08:11,659
We're under attack by some
sort of extraterrestrial race.

1303
01:08:11,693 --> 01:08:14,294
We encountered them when
we were looking for the drone.

1304
01:08:14,328 --> 01:08:17,832
Now they've injected something
into Stern and Taggart here.

1305
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:19,701
It'll rip
their circulatory systems

1306
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,836
from their bodies
and turn them into...

1307
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:23,671
that.

1308
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:24,839
What--Wait, what do you mean?

1309
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:26,273
You're saying that they

1310
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:28,576
turned their blood
into an alien creature?

1311
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,345
Why did they look
like Taggart and Stern?

1312
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,648
These things
can shape-shift, sir.

1313
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:36,818
Son, give me that gun.

1314
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,254
Oh, no. I'm not one of them.

1315
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,524
I've been bluffing
the whole time.

1316
01:08:43,558 --> 01:08:45,325
I've got them to trust me.

1317
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,762
Good, good.
You did--You did good.

1318
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,229
Now give me the gun.

1319
01:08:49,262 --> 01:08:51,164
Do it now!

1320
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,432
Yes, sir.

1321
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:00,173
President's the key to all this.

1322
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:02,309
If they can transform you
into an alien,

1323
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:04,746
they're gonna turn
everyone in the human race

1324
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:08,181
into one mega alien race.

1325
01:09:08,215 --> 01:09:09,917
That's not gonna happen.

1326
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:12,687
Dr. Ramsey's
on their transport.

1327
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,789
They've got Quinn hostage?

1328
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:17,592
She's trying to radio
Lieutenant Colonel Webb,

1329
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,793
but no response.

1330
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,830
Quinn, can you hear me?

1331
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:25,566
<i>Quinn?</i>

1332
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,802
Dad, listen to me.

1333
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:29,871
We are underwater.

1334
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:33,306
The mother ship
is in the Atlantic Ocean.

1335
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:52,894
Quinn, can you hear me?!

1336
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:56,229
We need to mobilize
our attack immediately, sir.

1337
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:57,732
I can't
until I know where she is.

1338
01:09:57,765 --> 01:09:59,567
Mr. President, if we don't act,

1339
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,602
it's gonna be too late.

1340
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:03,805
And your daughter
is inviting us.

1341
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:06,373
If she's on that alien ship
I can't!

1342
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:07,809
I can't do it, Nick!

1343
01:10:07,842 --> 01:10:09,677
Tom, the lives
of millions of people

1344
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:12,312
hang in the balance here.

1345
01:10:12,345 --> 01:10:14,816
If Quinn understood that,

1346
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:16,818
she understood the sacrifice.

1347
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:22,023
Now, Naval intelligence has
detected an active volcano

1348
01:10:22,056 --> 01:10:25,660
under the surface
of the ocean in that area.

1349
01:10:25,693 --> 01:10:28,596
Let's load those mecha sharks
with GOTA explosives,

1350
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:31,364
and we can trigger the volcano.

1351
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:32,834
And what good will that do?

1352
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:34,001
It's a failsafe.

1353
01:10:41,776 --> 01:10:43,443
Sir, I'm waiting
for your decision.

1354
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:48,883
Deploy.

1355
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:51,953
Yes, sir.

1356
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:53,788
We gotta get
the president out of here.

1357
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:56,724
There's no telling how many
people turned into those things.

1358
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:59,861
The evacuees we brought in,
there's hundreds of them.

1359
01:10:59,894 --> 01:11:01,529
They infiltrated
the FPS facility.

1360
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:03,296
This whole place
is gonna go under.

1361
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,333
Mount Weather's compromised.

1362
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,335
It's no longer safe
for the POTUS to be here.

1363
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:09,670
- We have to get him out.
- No.

1364
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:11,471
We can still save
the evacuees.

1365
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:13,574
The FPS may still be stopped.

1366
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:15,475
Come on.

1367
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:30,024
All right, let's do this.

1368
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,864
Robot's online.

1369
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:39,332
So far, so good.

1370
01:11:39,366 --> 01:11:40,968
Here goes.

1371
01:11:46,373 --> 01:11:49,043
The Ontogenesis phase has begun.

1372
01:11:49,076 --> 01:11:52,713
We started transforming humans
into more of our own kind.

1373
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:54,882
They have returned
from the shelter facility,

1374
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,984
where hundreds more await,

1375
01:11:57,018 --> 01:12:00,353
including their president.

1376
01:12:01,556 --> 01:12:02,757
You two have done well.

1377
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:05,760
Humans have cowered in fear

1378
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,829
from the might of our campaign.

1379
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:11,566
Now we begin to repopulate

1380
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,901
and return our dying species

1381
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:17,470
to the proud and noble race
it once was.

1382
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:19,472
Witness Xelitian power

1383
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:21,943
regain our dominance
in the galaxy.

1384
01:12:24,745 --> 01:12:27,949
Quinn, I got this sucker
up and running.

1385
01:12:27,982 --> 01:12:29,684
It's working.

1386
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:30,518
What's your 20?

1387
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,389
Madolyn, is that you?
Where are you now?

1388
01:12:36,423 --> 01:12:37,692
<i>I got the robot back online.</i>

1389
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,894
<i>Dad, are you okay?</i>
<i>Where's Quinn?</i>

1390
01:12:39,927 --> 01:12:40,995
Sir, wait. Don't.

1391
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,730
She could be
one of them by now.

1392
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:43,965
Don't be absurd, Private.

1393
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:45,600
She's my daughter.
She'd die first.

1394
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:46,601
Sir, he's right.

1395
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:48,368
We can't risk it.

1396
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:53,774
I don't know where she is.

1397
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:02,750
That screaming, the evacuees.

1398
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:04,484
We're too late.

1399
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:07,588
The FPS has reached
the safety area.

1400
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:09,023
We have to try and help 'em.

1401
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:11,926
Sir, the transformation
is hideous and quick.

1402
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:14,762
If we go down there,
we'll suffer the same fate.

1403
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:16,864
We have to get you out
of Mount Weather immediately.

1404
01:13:16,898 --> 01:13:18,733
There's hundreds of evacuees.

1405
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:21,802
And hundreds of aliens.

1406
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:24,437
If they breach the perimeter,
if they get out of here...

1407
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:25,840
they're out.

1408
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:29,710
Thousands, millions
will be turned.

1409
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:32,113
There won't even be
a human race anymore.

1410
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:34,882
We have to destroy
Mount Weather.

1411
01:13:38,185 --> 01:13:42,123
Maddie, bring that robot
to Mount Weather on the double.

1412
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:44,592
Help!

1413
01:13:46,227 --> 01:13:48,763
One of the weapons
is back online.

1414
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:49,864
What?

1415
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:53,000
Moving towards
Mount Weather facility

1416
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:56,003
and all the new spawn
growing within.

1417
01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:22,229
There's another one
of those drones flying over us.

1418
01:14:22,263 --> 01:14:24,699
I'd rather
take my chances out there

1419
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:26,634
- than what's in here with us.
- No!

1420
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,936
We can't let what's in here
with us get out there,

1421
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:29,971
not by any means.

1422
01:14:34,075 --> 01:14:36,544
All right,
you ugly son of a bitch.

1423
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:37,578
Let's go.

1424
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:25,726
- Tom--
- I am not deserting my post.

1425
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,095
If they get me,

1426
01:15:28,129 --> 01:15:31,565
then Madolyn can wipe
them all out with her robot.

1427
01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:45,813
It's failing.

1428
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,227
Whoa.

1429
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:01,262
Sh--

1430
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:03,664
Madolyn. Ma--

1431
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:05,599
Here they come.

1432
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:07,101
There's no way
we're gonna get home.

1433
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:12,673
We'll get as many
as are in this clip.

1434
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,397
Dad!

1435
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,865
Dad, do you copy?

1436
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,102
Dad, the robot's all messed up.

1437
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,171
Dad, do you copy?

1438
01:16:44,205 --> 01:16:45,206
Are you there?

1439
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:10,965
Oh, h-hang on. Hang on.

1440
01:17:10,998 --> 01:17:11,999
Hang on. Hang on.

1441
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:15,669
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

1442
01:17:15,703 --> 01:17:16,904
I'm unarmed.

1443
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:18,005
Hey, look. Look, look, look.

1444
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:20,074
I'm from NASA.

1445
01:17:20,107 --> 01:17:22,042
I'm from NASA. I'm from NASA.

1446
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:24,044
Hey, whoa. Hey, look.

1447
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:25,146
Look. Look, look.

1448
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:27,314
Ho oh oh.

1449
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:28,983
No, look!

1450
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:30,951
It's a radio.

1451
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,220
See? It's harmless.
It's harmless.

1452
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:36,857
See?

1453
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:38,325
It's a trophy. I-I won this.

1454
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:40,995
I-I put it in my bag
by accident,

1455
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:43,731
a-and I wanted
to keep it safe, so...

1456
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:44,765
Yeah.

1457
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:15,062
No! No!

1458
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,363
No!

1459
01:18:22,403 --> 01:18:24,471
Yes.

1460
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:55,269
Okay.

1461
01:18:56,804 --> 01:18:57,938
Okay.

1462
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,003
Easy. Easy.

1463
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:30,404
There's no time.
There's no time.

1464
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,172
Take cover! Take cover!

1465
01:19:33,974 --> 01:19:35,342
Dad, take cover!

1466
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,316
That's--That's not my dad.

1467
01:19:46,887 --> 01:19:49,524
Oh, man.
They're all getting out!

1468
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:18,919
Alien spaceship
fights a tornado.

1469
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,588
I'll let you know
who wins, Maddie.

1470
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,192
I love you.

1471
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:01,995
Quinn!

1472
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,263
Quinn.

1473
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:05,899
Quinn, are you okay? You okay?

1474
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,240
You, um...

1475
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:19,313
You owe me five bucks.

1476
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:26,320
The--The asteroid,
it was never meant to hit Earth.

1477
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:28,690
They needed us,

1478
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:33,160
humans, to repopulate
their species.

1479
01:21:35,597 --> 01:21:37,464
Yeah, those things, they, um...

1480
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:42,035
they got into the facility,

1481
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:44,405
and they turned everyone into...

1482
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:47,074
whatever.

1483
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:50,978
Dad?

1484
01:21:52,614 --> 01:21:53,615
Mm-mmm.

1485
01:21:57,084 --> 01:22:01,221
But he kept them from turning
any more of us into one of them.

1486
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:03,457
He was a hero,

1487
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:05,693
and he saved our lives.

1488
01:22:10,197 --> 01:22:13,233
We can't let that be in vain.

1489
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:15,035
He would have--

1490
01:22:15,068 --> 01:22:18,305
He would have already started
helping rebuild the world.

1491
01:22:19,406 --> 01:22:21,074
Do you think
that we could do that

1492
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,309
as friends, instead of rivals?

1493
01:22:27,147 --> 01:22:29,349
I know that was my idea.

1494
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:34,221
Peace.

1495
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:39,326
Honestly, Quinn,
I don't even know anymore.

1496
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:41,462
Okay.

1497
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,331
Fine.

1498
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:47,334
Agree to disagree.

1499
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,236
Oh, my God.

1500
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:55,577
Let's get up.

1501
01:22:57,411 --> 01:23:00,548
What are you doing
fighting aliens?

1502
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:04,017
Just--

1503
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:05,252
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1504
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:06,386
All right.
