1
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,334
Mind yourself.

2
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,643
Oh, my God, Tara.

3
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:24,872
Your water's broke.

4
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,079
Her water.

5
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,079
Tara!

6
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,756
Marry me! I'm your man!

7
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:18,231
Thirty flooded acres!

8
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,597
Go away and leave us alone.

9
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,501
- I'm talking to Tara.
-Go away, Mick.

10
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,130
Who else'll have you now?

11
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,368
- Huh?
-Home, now. Sleep it off.

12
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,611
How are they?

13
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,643
Fine, thank you, Sergeant.

14
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,752
It's Mick and the sergeant
at it again.

15
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,728
They're like tomcats.

16
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,197
They'll only
come near me at night.

17
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,468
At least we've a man
on our side from now on.

18
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,427
Aren't you the lucky lad, Jimmy?

19
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,835
This dump is going
to be all yours one day...

20
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,031
if you're not careful.

21
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,470
Oh, Tara.

22
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,005
I couldn't bear to touch it,
the poor wee thing.

23
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,055
Mrs. Ryan.

24
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,722
I'm only here
because I feel sorry for you.

25
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,857
You can spare your sorrow
for yourself.

26
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,889
What can we do for you?

27
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,198
A button. A fairly big one
that's fairly small...

28
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:05,433
with four holes,
as opposed to two.

29
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,998
I'm making my niece a dress.
She's emigrating.

30
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,170
Lucky bitch.

31
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,072
What about this?

32
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,547
It's the latest fashion,
you know.

33
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,208
She's my niece, not a trollop.

34
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,814
- Would this do?
-Sixpence.

35
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,429
God love us.
Poor wee bastard.

36
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,761
Shut your gob.

37
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,893
Who's the father?

38
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,700
There'll be no luck about
this place until you own up.

39
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,100
If everyone around here
owned up to their sins...

40
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,508
there'd be a queue at
the confession box a mile long.

41
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,284
Come on! Pull!

42
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,672
Holy God. Why me?

43
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:21,646
Since you gave up the drink,
has it been any easier?

44
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,550
Worse. Far worse.

45
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,419
Drink's an anesthetic.

46
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,722
It takes away the feelings
for a while, the pain.

47
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,989
And the joy.

48
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,655
I can't remember.

49
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:40,827
God sees your suffering
and understands.

50
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,632
Then why can't she?

51
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,730
You're not the only man
who wants to marry her.

52
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,572
Is it Mick you're talking about?

53
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,738
If he so much as
lays a finger on her...

54
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,304
I'll strangle him with me--

55
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,782
Don't commit murder
in your heart, man.

56
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,477
May God forgive me, Father...

57
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,919
but that's the way I feel
sometimes.

58
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,236
Mick has blown his brains out!
Come on!

59
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,753
The rain drove him crazy.

60
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,592
- Why?
-'Cause his cows was dying.

61
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,427
He had no wife, that's why.

62
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:21,492
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

63
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,767
Give us a hand, you two.

64
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,247
You should've seized the gun off
of him, Sergeant.

65
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,157
The state he was in.
Revoked his license!

66
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,786
Leave me be.

67
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:03,238
Scandal is a contagion.

68
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,144
And one sinner...

69
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,548
can infect an entire community.

70
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,780
Tara Maguire...

71
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,948
name the man who wronged you...

72
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,014
or the whoremaster
will bring down...

73
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:22,154
yet more corruption and disaster
on the heads of us all!

74
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,159
Tara?

75
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,463
Tara!

76
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,903
Tara, my dear child...

77
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:34,602
trust in your neighbors
and your friends...

78
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,166
and in the Lord!

79
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,347
She's not a leper.

80
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,821
You're flying
in the face of the parish...

81
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,345
and Mick's suicide
was the last straw.

82
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,950
That's one mortal sin
they can't nail on me.

83
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,360
I wish to God
I was in Dublin or London.

84
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,124
With a baby
tucked under your arms?

85
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,531
You wouldn't last five minutes.

86
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,371
- Leave it there.
-Don't be stupid.

87
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,958
Own up.
Whose baby is it?

88
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,228
Ask your husbands.

89
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,866
He's my baby! Mine!

90
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,928
Look!

91
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,871
"Murder in the Red Barn."

92
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,377
- Will there be guns in it?
-Is it a cowboy?

93
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,243
There's guns in it, all right...

94
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,838
and an axe...

95
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,873
and a boy and a cow.

96
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,114
I wonder what "The Nun's Story"
will be about.

97
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,815
It's about a nun.

98
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:34,053
What do you get
if you win the raffle?

99
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,323
The first prize...

100
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,228
is a pound of butter
and a packet of tea.

101
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,562
We have a double bed.

102
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,192
Could sleep three easy.

103
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,759
Is that right?

104
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,396
“The Crappy Boy.“

105
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,203
“The Crappy Buy.“
Come here to me, you.

106
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,699
Did you not wash behind
your ears this morning, lad?

107
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,743
How much is six pence?

108
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,148
For you, three pence.
Only for you, though.

109
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,517
What is that?

110
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,643
I bet those flowers
are for Tara.

111
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,394
Morning, Father.

112
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,266
Morning, Father.

113
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,705
Just like all the other men
in this place.

114
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,708
Scared to death of the priest.

115
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:32,303
Scared to death of you,
more like.

116
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,946
I could have gone...

117
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,576
to the ecclesiastical
outfitters in Dublin, Tara...

118
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,315
but I'd rather
you had the money.

119
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,652
If you're not too proud
to take it, that is.

120
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,182
What's your inside leg, Father?

121
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,888
I don't understand
your question.

122
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,055
Here, hold this.

123
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,525
Up higher. That's it.

124
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,504
You still angry at me?

125
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,033
You read me from the pulpit,
and I'll never forgive you...

126
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,567
but I need your money.

127
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,178
He looks like a tough
wee customer right enough.

128
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,549
I'll have it within the week.
Do you want the same--

129
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:15,317
Exactly the same, if you please.

130
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,619
Change is a dangerous thing.

131
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,252
Change of fashion,
change of heart, of mind...

132
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,160
change of religion...

133
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,598
it's all a sign
of these shallow times.

134
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,027
Mick's death
could've been avoided, Tara.

135
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,597
He killed himself
over bad money...

136
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,041
and rotten land,
not for my sake.

137
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,874
But the sergeant,
now, there's a man...

138
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,777
who could be relied on
by anyone.

139
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,144
Indeed.

140
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,173
He's just the person to set you
on the straight and narrow.

141
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,686
What do you say?

142
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,485
I'll be needing half the cash
in advance, by the way.

143
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:54,050
Tara, don't drive another soul
to drink and despair.

144
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,570
What the hell are you doing?

145
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,511
Woodwork, sir. It's me hobby.

146
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,605
I wish I had the time
for woodwork.

147
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,584
If ever you do, sir,
I'll lend you me tools.

148
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,679
Let me smell your breath.

149
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,523
Get out on patrol-now.

150
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:34,500
You're supposed to be
a policeman, not a carpenter.

151
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,099
Tara...

152
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:50,439
up to your old tricks again?

153
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,775
What do you think?

154
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,214
Once a smuggler,
always a smuggler.

155
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,944
It's food, that's all.

156
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,885
And a suit for Father Malone.

157
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,857
It's time he changed out of
sackcloth and ashes anyway.

158
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,325
Would you look at the two of us?

159
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,896
The lawbreaker and the lawmaker.

160
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,607
I'm earning a bit extra
for me and the baby.

161
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,277
You trying to make life
more difficult for us?

162
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,147
There's nothing I want less.

163
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,811
Let me go, then.

164
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,651
What's happened to your hand?

165
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:46,427
Just a little nick,
cleaning me bicycle.

166
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,504
Marry me, or I'll go mad.

167
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,607
I'd go mad if I did.

168
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,079
Let me look after
the two of you.

169
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,819
We don't need looking after.

170
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,223
You will.

171
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,262
Splendid. Splendid!

172
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:33,232
Do you know, I can smell money.

173
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,869
Vonnie, dream's over.
Back to reality.

174
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,121
How are youse?
Youse are welcome.

175
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,214
Youse are welcome here, too!

176
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,227
Thank you, Seamus.
Thank you, Gerry.

177
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,389
- I've got a piano.
-So have I.

178
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,860
You can give them
all the Shakespeare you want.

179
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,869
They won't know the difference.

180
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,997
- You coming to the show?
-Yeah.

181
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,803
Yeah, of course.

182
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,143
In front of the children.
Vonnie.

183
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,049
Looks like
the last place God made.

184
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:24,415
Isn't that what you said about
the place we were last week?

185
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,916
- I was wrong.
-Will you shut up, Vonnie?

186
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,759
You're always grousing.

187
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,332
Let's get this show
off the road.

188
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,579
I got first tabs on her.

189
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:48,138
You can have the sister.

190
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,217
With a bit of luck, man...

191
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,947
we'll have a great time, huh?

192
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,965
If these chancers on the green
cause you any trouble...

193
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,494
you've only to say the word.

194
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,905
They're only trying
to scrape a living...

195
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,875
same as the rest of us.

196
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,671
Ah, Sergeant.
Complimentary tickets...

197
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,613
for yourself...
and your family?

198
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,118
I'll be there every night...

199
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,381
on duty.

200
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,747
What do you think you're doing?

201
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,150
Hello. I'm Tom Casey.

202
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,119
I'm from
the Department of Agriculture.

203
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,350
We're investigating
these chickens...

204
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:04,754
for the old epidemic...

205
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,158
and I can see you don't believe
a word I'm saying.

206
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,561
I was stealing
one of your chickens.

207
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,859
Right.

208
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,534
I'd better call
Sergeant Hegalty, then.

209
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,936
No, no. Wait a minute.
I'll pay you for it.

210
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,598
Ten bob.

211
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,702
What? You must be joking.
It's not worth two bob.

212
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,236
Sergeant! Sergeant!

213
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,875
Wait a minute.
Will you hold your horses here?

214
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,444
Wait till I see
what I have for you here. Now...

215
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,286
- Five bob do it?
-No.

216
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,588
For now.
I'll owe you the rest.

217
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,589
I'll give it to you
after the show tonight.

218
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:53,102
I want the five bob you owe me
before the show.

219
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,702
You must think
I'm a terrible idiot.

220
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:03,114
Oh, no, no, no.
I can see you're not.

221
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,480
Good.

222
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,657
Hope you taste better
than you look.

223
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,068
You bloody chancer.
We don't want more trouble.

224
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,663
He flew right under me jacket,
I'm telling you.

225
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,401
Behave yourself this year,
or I'll tell John-Joe.

226
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,777
You can talk.

227
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,647
At least it'll bring
a bit of custom into the shop.

228
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,380
We made five bob already.

229
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,756
Would you?

230
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,321
I would.

231
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:04,570
My mother, she said
put your shirts back on.

232
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,376
It's not decent half-naked.

233
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,883
Tell her to come over here
herself, will you?

234
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,459
One, two, three.

235
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,485
Up. There she goes.

236
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,613
What's the new sergeant
like here?

237
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,984
He's nice.
He's after Tara Maguire.

238
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,581
Is he, by Christ?
Who's after the sister?

239
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,989
Blacksmith.

240
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,221
So you're out of luck there
as well.

241
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:10,105
It's a woman driving.

242
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,379
I hate hanging around
on these jobs.

243
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,144
The place is crawling
with customs men.

244
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,778
Relax, Richie.

245
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,812
If they put you in jail,
I'll bake you a cake.

246
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,633
Do you know what this is?

247
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,433
Sure. Wireless with pictures.

248
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,235
Is this more cloth
for His Holiness?

249
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:15,570
'Tis.

250
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,542
Let's hope he gets
another year in Purgatory...

251
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,773
for saying Mass
in smuggled clothes.

252
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:28,417
Come on, Tara.
Just for old times' sake.

253
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,558
One extra.

254
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,428
For a man named Cassidy.

255
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,523
He'll be passing your way.

256
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,126
What is it?
Second-hand false teeth?

257
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,568
Razor blades.

258
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:49,866
I hear you're marrying
the sergeant.

259
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:52,708
Good move, Tara.

260
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:54,645
Where'd you hear that?

261
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,149
Father Malone.

262
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:59,277
He told
the wife's sister's auntie.

263
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,277
If you believe all you hear,
you'll eat all you see.

264
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:12,756
Smuggling with a baby.
That's a new one.

265
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,859
Best to start 'em young,
like gamecocks.

266
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:35,054
You coming to the show tonight?

267
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,680
Didn't we see it last year?

268
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,383
Might be even better this year.

269
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:40,893
That wouldn't be hard.

270
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,494
Jesus.

271
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,833
That's not another one of mine,
is it?

272
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,101
Sure. Hasn't he tattoos
all over his bum?

273
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,873
Your razor blades.

274
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,974
Thanks.

275
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,883
They're cheaper in the north.

276
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,650
I use them in an act.

277
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:15,558
Razor blades, my foot.

278
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,400
We'll definitely
have to go now...

279
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,665
see the old armchair
up on the stage.

280
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,468
Why are you always
following me around?

281
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,064
Because you're
as slippery as an eel.

282
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,166
And remember, I know what
happened to you in Dublin.

283
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,904
Nobody knows
what happened in Dublin...

284
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,878
so shut your gob.

285
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:41,549
Hope he doesn't
electrocute himself.

286
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,926
Look at him now.

287
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:11,917
Good man, eh? Good man.

288
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:15,615
It's not the first time
he's stole electric.

289
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,531
I'd be lost without you, Tom.

290
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,163
Ba njaxed.

291
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,003
You're banjaxed with me,
Freddie.

292
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,474
So what's the difference?

293
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,069
'Tis I, Hamlet the Dane!

294
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:41,836
Romeo!

295
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:45,476
Romeo!
Wherefore alt thou, Romeo?

296
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:48,180
Is this a padre
that I see before me?

297
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,780
How are you, Freddie?
Good to see you.

298
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,552
How long are you here for
this time?

299
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,116
Well, a week or two...

300
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,594
depending on the box office.

301
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,290
Grand. I'll announce it
from the pulpit.

302
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,695
You'll pack out, Freddie.

303
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:01,496
We'll make the usual donation.

304
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,002
Grand.

305
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,630
One thing, mind. Legs.

306
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,334
No unseemly display of flesh.

307
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,843
Is that clear?

308
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,239
Of course, Father.

309
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,475
Grand.

310
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,619
Are we late?

311
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,255
Not at all.
They can't start without us.

312
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:34,528
Next, please. Sixpence.
Thank you.

313
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:37,727
Come on, boys.

314
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:52,917
Down by the Sally Gardens

315
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:59,119
My love and I did meet

316
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:10,263
Sir, we never had anything
to do with insurrection.

317
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:13,294
We're a law-abiding family, sir,
and always have been.

318
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,068
Well, now, honest to God, sir.

319
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,940
I cannot believe a word
coming out of her lying lips.

320
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,809
No. Now, you can, sir.

321
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,472
I told me son...

322
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:24,141
that if he ever wanted
to fight for his country...

323
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,811
there was no use in him coming
to me for the old gun.

324
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,320
I have it well hidden, sir.

325
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,846
In the thatch.
Out of harm's way.

326
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,718
Can you speak
somewhat slower, man?

327
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,729
I can hardly understand
a word the damn fool says.

328
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,097
Will you shut up, you idiot?

329
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,035
Don't worry, sir.
if I hear anything...

330
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,801
coming out about
the rising of the moon...

331
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,434
'twill be the first thing I do
is let you know...

332
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:51,807
and that's God's truth, sir!

333
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,370
I have to agree with that.
That's God's truth, sir.

334
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,781
Only one son of mine
ever bore arms...

335
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,477
and that was me first born,
you know, Douglas.

336
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:03,182
He was shot a while back,
the yeoman of Wexler.

337
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,658
Easy, easy!

338
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,126
What's the damn fool saying?

339
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,185
He's a bit soft
in the head, sir...

340
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,822
since the mule kicked him.

341
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,423
That's why he rambles on.

342
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,866
I think we can proceed, sir.

343
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,869
I have searched
the premises thoroughly.

344
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,234
The only thing to be caught...

345
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,603
in this godforsaken hole
is the cold.

346
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,268
You'd catch more than that
if you knew where to look.

347
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,639
- What did he say?
-No idea, sir.

348
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,745
You're next.

349
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,445
Our hearts are broke
with the murder...

350
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,385
mayhem, and general debauch.

351
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,118
Rebellion
is a hanging offense, madame!

352
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:42,185
Nonetheless, I compliment you
on your choice of armchair.

353
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,161
Fit for the king himself.

354
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,826
Captain Williams,
let us proceed--

355
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,595
Where is the damn boy?

356
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:53,162
I saw him going out
that way, sir.

357
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:56,300
Maybe to join
his regiment of friends.

358
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,208
God bless him.

359
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,307
Watching without paying.

360
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,839
I caught you.

361
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,374
We're even, so.

362
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,443
You wouldn't have the loan
of a few pounds, would you?

363
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,080
I'll give it back to you
before Christmas.

364
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:13,057
Are you Tara or Brigid?

365
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,288
Tara.

366
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,227
The one with the baby?

367
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:21,028
Aw, Christ.
Of all the luck.

368
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,700
I've sworn to capture
every Croppy Boy...

369
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:30,470
that dares show his face...

370
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,978
and the rest
I'll hunt down like foxes!

371
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:34,480
And furthermore...

372
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,743
there will be scaffolds
on every hill...

373
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,648
from here to Sligo!

374
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,019
The battalion has returned.

375
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,526
It's raining buckets, Captain.

376
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:06,641
Tara.

377
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:13,175
Tara, it's me, Brendan.

378
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,324
Can I touch?

379
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:24,796
For a quid.

380
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,068
Come back tomorrow night.

381
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,369
The show's always different.

382
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,973
That tire's as bald as an egg.

383
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,543
Shouldn't be on the road.

384
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:49,611
Dear, oh, dear.

385
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,454
I just simply hadn't noticed.

386
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,186
Oh, Tom.

387
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:57,419
Did you enjoy the show, Sarge?

388
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,433
Do you have the insurance
documents for these vehicles?

389
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,094
We do, of course.
We have the death certificate...

390
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,833
birth certificate,
dog license. The lot.

391
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,840
Right away, showman.

392
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,844
Actor, if you don't mind.

393
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,470
This isn't a circus.

394
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:14,946
As near as, damn it.

395
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,642
Oh, now,
my dear sergeant...

396
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,651
let's be Christian about this.

397
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:22,950
Bear with me while I take off
my tatters and greasepaints...

398
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,717
and we'll have
a drink together...

399
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,281
to celebrate a successful
first night.

400
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm not a drinking man.

401
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,991
Oh? You surprise me.

402
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,829
I want those documents now.

403
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:37,063
I'll post them to you
first thing in the morning.

404
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:40,333
You'll have them
by the end of the month.

405
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,170
I'm only joking, Sergeant.

406
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:07,555
Tara, it's Sergeant Hegalty.
He wants to talk.

407
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,966
You're looking grand, Tara.
Lovely.

408
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,070
What's that
you brought with you?

409
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:26,075
It's a...it's a crib.

410
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:32,221
I made it for you and the baby.

411
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,360
I can't take it.

412
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,303
I only want him to sleep
in my crib, that's all.

413
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,306
No.

414
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,401
Please, try to understand.

415
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,073
I can't put him in there.

416
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,603
Why?

417
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,382
Look at it, won't you?

418
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,410
It's beautiful.

419
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,621
You know why.

420
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,821
I don't like
what you're trying to do.

421
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,757
It won't eat him.

422
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,934
It's wood.

423
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,637
That's all it is.

424
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,771
Please!

425
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,243
Wood.

426
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,511
Leave us alone.

427
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,109
Nqw!

428
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,692
It's only wood.

429
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,824
I can wait.

430
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:56,407
At least it can keep him
warm for an hour.

431
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:27,965
Seven...

432
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:36,880
Cassidy.

433
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,405
Dear boy.

434
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,382
Thank you so much.

435
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,913
Now my little princess.

436
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,890
Bravo.

437
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,222
Thomas?

438
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,862
Well-earned, well-earned.

439
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,265
Here we are.
Thank you so much indeed.

440
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,565
Thank you for
a lovely performance last night.

441
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,368
There we are. That's it.

442
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,168
- And what about Timmy?
-it's my job.

443
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:09,203
That last pile...it's my son's.

444
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:12,649
He doesn't qualify yet
for a share.

445
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:16,052
I was ten years on the road
before I got a penny.

446
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,250
And you did it all
on a one-wheeled bicycle.

447
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,917
Will you play fair, Freddie?

448
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,426
Play fair?

449
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,691
This time last year,
you were in the gutter, lad.

450
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,960
This time this year,
we're all in the gutter.

451
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,729
Where's the gold you owe us
from the Fair of Muff?

452
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,429
It's like getting blood
out of a turnip!

453
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,564
But just think!

454
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:35,835
I mean,
the price of petrol...

455
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:38,343
running repairs
on the tent, income tax.

456
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,538
Income tax?

457
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:41,239
That's the best one yet!

458
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,509
You do all right, Rachel.

459
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,607
No one asks you
to share your perks.

460
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,913
How dare you?

461
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:50,786
Unhand me, or I'll evict you
from your parts!

462
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,154
Holy God,
every week the same.

463
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,023
We're all
in the same leaky boat.

464
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,893
I'm warning you, Freddie,
I'm ready to jump overboard.

465
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:02,425
In all of my years...never!

466
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,231
Ingrates!

467
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:07,330
I could've gone to England,
made a fortune...

468
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,398
but I stayed here
to preserve the genius...

469
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,570
of our Irish theater!

470
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,603
I promise to make stars of you!

471
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,116
We're not
peasants in the fields!

472
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,017
Dead souls in factories!

473
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,487
We are actors!

474
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,537
Tom...

475
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,913
I realized years ago...

476
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,409
there's no crock of gold
in this life.

477
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:59,550
There's just two magic hours
up here, every night.

478
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,491
Ah, Freddie.

479
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,494
We're only dreaming.

480
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,896
Give up that dream, Tom,
and you're finished.

481
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,299
Maybe we're finished anyway.

482
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,395
Tom, when I retire...

483
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,304
all this can be yours.

484
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,680
I'd better go get
a needle and thread, then.

485
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,668
Hello?

486
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,197
Hi.

487
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,539
How do you do?

488
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:57,813
Listen, I'm truly sorry
I put me foot in it yesterday.

489
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,284
I had no notion
you were married.

490
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,377
Since when?

491
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,920
I didn't want an old husband.

492
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,619
I just wanted a baby.

493
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,425
Liar. You didn't even
want a baby...

494
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:14,091
till the baby started
wanting you.

495
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,226
He's no fool, that baby.

496
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,599
Look, I'm only here for a week.

497
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,734
What are you doing
for the rest of the day?

498
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,369
Cheek!

499
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,937
Clear off, you buck idiot!

500
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,348
Hey! This is me Sunday shirt!

501
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,818
Give us a break, will you?

502
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,411
I'll break your head,
that's what.

503
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,358
Are you mad? Get out of here!

504
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,589
Get out!

505
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:49,030
You're the idiot.

506
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,365
I'll see you
in the front row tonight.

507
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,338
Let you in for half price,
if you're lucky.

508
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,456
Are you stone mad entirely?

509
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:16,961
Will you leave me alone?

510
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,394
Never.

511
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,798
I'm staying here all day
and all night...

512
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,198
until you come out
for a walk with me.

513
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,931
Go away and take
a running jump for yourself.

514
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,274
Take a running jump, huh?

515
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,905
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

516
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,314
Stop that, or you'll be sorry.

517
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,909
Where's the man
that's going to stop me?

518
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,282
In there with you?

519
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,632
I'm sure
it's not the first time...

520
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,695
you've seen a man
without his trousers, huh?

521
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,168
How are they from behind?

522
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,306
Try the jacket.

523
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,155
Yeah, that's grand.

524
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,486
Grand.

525
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,389
That's a...

526
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,490
a nice lipstick
you're wearing, Tara.

527
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,332
Unusual.

528
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,700
How are you, Jimmy?

529
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,367
How are you?

530
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,878
He's great. Lovely.

531
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,345
That's five pound you owe me.

532
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,577
If you're
not getting married...

533
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:50,452
that child ought to go to
St. Jude's Orphanage in Dublin.

534
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,785
The nuns there
will look after him...

535
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,951
body and soul,
better than you can, Tara.

536
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,518
I could bury him alive.
How would that suit you?

537
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,928
You can't fly
in the face of God, my girl.

538
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,797
Sergeant Hegarty...

539
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,030
you could redeem that man.

540
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,596
We can only redeem ourselves.

541
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,273
What is it you're after?

542
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,018
I heard about the daddy.

543
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,490
What did you hear?

544
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:02,289
Heard he killed himself...

545
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:04,557
after the baby was born.

546
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:09,327
Lord God, that must've been
terrible for you, Tara.

547
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:36,995
What are you collecting
the feathers for?

548
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,125
A hat I'm making.

549
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,998
Oh? Going somewhere special?

550
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:49,538
- Look at her.
-She's gorgeous.

551
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:52,566
Look at that hat on her.

552
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,391
Stop this!

553
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:52,665
Stop!

554
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:59,207
I distinctly requested...

555
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:01,713
that no short skirts
were to be worn.

556
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,737
Yes, but the flesh
is well covered.

557
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:06,978
There'll be some Shakespeare
after the interval, Father.

558
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,213
Will there?

559
00:48:08,253 --> 00:48:12,781
Weak minds are easily twisted
by wanton imaginings.

560
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:15,293
Why do you think
God gave actresses legs?

561
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,818
Keep God out of this, showman.

562
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,661
Jeez, anyone would think
we were dancing naked.

563
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,496
You're worse than tinkers.

564
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,570
Interval!

565
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:30,871
You can do all your fighting
outside of the tent!

566
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,604
But this is
better than the show!

567
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,107
Father, I've got
lovely chocolates and...

568
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,985
Come on, move out! Come on!

569
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,815
Come on.

570
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,727
Oh, hello.

571
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:53,225
I didn't think you'd come.

572
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,296
Are you enjoying it?

573
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,496
It's a great gas so far.

574
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,775
What's this?

575
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,414
Tell me, are you long at it?

576
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,921
No. No, believe it or not...

577
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,514
it's me first time on the road.

578
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,547
Thought as much.

579
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,532
It'll be me last time,
you know.

580
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,897
The way I'm thinking...

581
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,834
soon as this season's over...

582
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,837
I'm going back to America.

583
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,862
- America?
-Yeah.

584
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,968
Excuse me, my dear.

585
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,808
That's a splendid hat.

586
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,813
I made it meself.

587
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:46,681
Do you sing, as well?

588
00:49:46,718 --> 00:49:48,812
Thomas, "Othello" tonight.

589
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,014
"Othello"?

590
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,818
We must keep the Vatican happy.

591
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,484
I'll see you later.
I don't know the lines yet.

592
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,220
Don't worry.
I'll prompt you.

593
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,033
What's all this?

594
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,199
Play actors, sir.

595
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,436
The IRA exploded a bomb
this evening.

596
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,103
Nobody from
this district, sir.

597
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,704
The boys around here
couldn't blow up a balloon.

598
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:18,717
And I've had reports of
a rash of smuggling going on.

599
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,219
The border's miles long.
You might as well try...

600
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,516
and stop the wind
from crossing over and back.

601
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,613
This is your last chance,
Hegalty.

602
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:27,647
Next time,
it won't be a transfer.

603
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,558
You'll be cashiered.

604
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,945
It's a waste of time, Sergeant.

605
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:54,043
There's not
an IRA man for miles.

606
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,455
To hell with all men.

607
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,082
And women.

608
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:12,225
...thicken other proofs
that do demonstrate thinly.

609
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,034
I'll tear her all to pieces.

610
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:17,167
Tell me but this...

611
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,439
have you not sometimes
seen a handkerchief...

612
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:25,575
spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand? Huh?

613
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:28,278
I gave her such a one...

614
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,845
'twas my first gift.

615
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,687
I know not that...

616
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,214
but such a handkerchief--

617
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,125
I am sure
it was your wife's--

618
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:40,893
did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

619
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:53,842
O, now, forever...

620
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:57,212
farewell the tranquil mind!

621
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,807
Farewell content!

622
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,842
Farewell the plumed troop...

623
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,480
and the big wars
that make ambition virtue!

624
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,422
O, farewell!

625
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,585
The spirit-stirring drum...

626
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,720
the ear-piercing fife...

627
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:14,493
and all quality, pride,
pomp and circumstance...

628
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:17,524
of glorious war! Farewell!

629
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:21,402
Othello's occupation's gone!

630
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,978
What are you going to do
when you grow up, huh?

631
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,890
What am I going to do
when I grow up?

632
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,558
If I grow up.

633
00:53:20,131 --> 00:53:22,566
Here.

634
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,570
There you are, now.

635
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:28,573
We can tell your <i>mammy</i>
you're on the wireless.

636
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:36,943
There's the smile.

637
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,142
Give us a kiss.

638
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:40,913
Put him down
before you drop him.

639
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:43,546
He's fine.

640
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:47,422
Well, are you coming or not?

641
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,426
Why should I?

642
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,021
Come on.
Make hay while the sun shines.

643
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,014
Will you look at this?

644
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,079
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

645
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,236
My own first cousin

646
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:39,744
That did me betray

647
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:42,474
And for one fair guinea

648
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:46,211
Swore my life away

649
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:51,552
As I was mounted
on the platform high

650
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:56,459
My aged father was standing by

651
00:54:56,494 --> 00:55:01,432
My aged father did me deny

652
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,332
And the name he gave me

653
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:08,362
Was The Crappy Boy

654
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:11,706
I'd stand in the snow
listening to you.

655
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:15,303
With a voice like that,
you should be somewhere else.

656
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,584
Sure. Didn't he go
all round America last year?

657
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,782
Well, halfway around there.
Halfway round.

658
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:28,224
What happened?
Did your bicycle get a puncture?

659
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,252
Well, I was
in a nightclub there...

660
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:33,229
and I drank a drink
they had there...

661
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:36,564
called a Screwdriver.

662
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,332
By God, it'd make poteen
taste like holy water.

663
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:41,998
And that was in Philadelphia.

664
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,100
And I woke up the next day,
I was in San Francisco.

665
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,769
I'm telling you,
that's the only way to travel.

666
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:50,247
That settles it.
I'm going meself next year.

667
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,477
I wish you would.

668
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,516
Go away.

669
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,991
Come on...

670
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,691
while the day's in it.

671
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,483
- See you.
-Yeah, all right.

672
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:14,229
Tara, you're too fast for me.

673
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:16,290
You don't do it right.

674
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,399
I nearly burst into laughing
when he led you and Jimmy...

675
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:22,497
up the hayfield
on that old donkey.

676
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,635
The Blessed Virgin wasn't in it.

677
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:28,839
He's the maddest fella
ever I met, I tell you.

678
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:34,079
And best of all,
he's been to America.

679
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:35,347
What would you say
if your little sister...

680
00:57:35,386 --> 00:57:37,354
ended up in Boston?

681
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:39,914
Tara, easy now.

682
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,655
You don't know who he is
or where he comes from.

683
00:57:43,694 --> 00:57:46,720
You're a terrible woman
for galloping ahead of yourself.

684
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,735
I'm late. I'm late.

685
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,499
Oh, here.

686
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,815
Who are you waiting on?

687
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,786
What's it to do with you?

688
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,795
It's everything to do with me.

689
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,821
Steer clear, man.

690
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,857
She's spoken for.

691
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,666
Is that right?

692
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:29,002
She said nothing to me about it.

693
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,474
She wouldn't. She's frightened.

694
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:34,672
Frightened of you?

695
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:38,273
Frightened of the truth.

696
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,283
What truth?

697
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,652
The baby's mine.

698
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,288
Ask her.

699
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,108
Quiet.
You're waking the dead.

700
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,735
Back in your box.

701
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,673
What are you doing here,
sitting in the dark?

702
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,980
What's eating you, man?

703
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:20,082
I can't wait to see
the back of this dump.

704
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:21,888
Did her ladyship stand you up?

705
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:25,453
You're safer counting on
racehorses than on women.

706
00:59:25,496 --> 00:59:29,023
I left a wife in Tralee
30 years ago.

707
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,160
Never regretted it.

708
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:35,160
A woman, a baby,
and a mystery man for a father.

709
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:36,502
It's dynamite.

710
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,204
They say the paramour blew
his head off with a shotgun.

711
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,407
And maybe she drove him to it.

712
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:47,315
She won't drive me,
I'm telling you.

713
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:49,149
Where the hell are we next week?

714
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,449
Tullyvin.

715
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:51,955
The crack'll be mighty, eh?

716
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:54,117
"The crack'll be mighty."

717
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:56,286
How many times
have I heard that before?

718
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:58,455
"The crack'll be mighty."

719
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:00,088
Will you look at us?

720
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,565
We're nothing but
a bunch of cut-price tinkers...

721
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,092
married to the road
and a bottle of booze.

722
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,606
I'm packing this in.

723
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,337
You really need to go careful
in this life.

724
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,937
You give up one kind of magic,
you find you need another.

725
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,883
Rather a waste. I was hoping
you'd bring the girl along.

726
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,511
There's bags of sewing
to be done.

727
01:00:22,553 --> 01:00:24,885
And if she can sing as well...

728
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,617
I could sack Vonnie.

729
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:49,606
Tara.

730
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:52,772
Brendan?

731
01:00:58,088 --> 01:00:59,715
I've told him the truth.

732
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,725
You're lying.

733
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,489
Why?

734
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:06,826
Why do you think, woman?

735
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:10,232
If you won't have me,
you'll have nobody.

736
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,131
Let me go.

737
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,536
I'll never let you go.

738
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,973
You're destroying my life,
Brendan.

739
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,908
I love you.

740
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,672
I love you.

741
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:24,204
Get your hands off her.

742
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:27,309
Now, one of youse is a liar.

743
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:30,321
Which is it?

744
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,515
Tara?

745
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:34,286
You're out of your depth here.
Clear off.

746
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:36,918
I'm not asking you!

747
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,758
I'm asking her.

748
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,331
Tom...

749
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,733
Brendan, you're crucifying me.

750
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:53,642
We lay together
not fifty yards from here.

751
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:56,442
You offered yourself to me.

752
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,915
Show me the man
that could've refused.

753
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:02,783
I've kept your secret
from that night on...

754
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,879
because you begged me to.

755
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:02,408
It was
a beautiful summer's evening.

756
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:05,882
I was walking in the orchard.

757
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,949
When he first came here
from Dublin...

758
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:18,826
he was the most powerful man
I'd ever seen.

759
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,830
I didn't know then...

760
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:23,162
the way drink
had nearly ruined him...

761
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,726
nor the danger burning in him.

762
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:30,168
I was nervous of him...

763
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,699
but flattered...

764
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,905
so I laid down with him
on the grass.

765
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,815
A few weeks later,
I knew I was pregnant.

766
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,749
I was in turmoil.

767
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:46,720
When I told him,
he begged me to marry him.

768
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:49,988
I couldn't.

769
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,758
He promised
he'd keep the secret.

770
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,731
Then just before
the baby was born...

771
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:02,671
he started coming to me...

772
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:06,233
always in the dead of night...

773
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,267
like a hunter.

774
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,508
Then you should marry him, so.

775
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:15,351
I don't love him.

776
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:18,355
How could I spend my life
locked up in that barracks?

777
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:25,185
Him of all people.

778
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,230
To hell with it.

779
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,727
To hell with you, then!

780
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:07,680
It's our last night here
tomorrow night.

781
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,027
Where are you heading?

782
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:20,969
Tullyvin, then on to Dublin.

783
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:23,871
Could you give me a lift
to Dublin?

784
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:29,542
If I got you as far as Dublin,
you'd never get rid of me.

785
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:49,490
You've never been married?

786
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,729
No.

787
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:56,239
For who'd have me?

788
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:03,339
Maybe some poor soft idiot
with another man's child.

789
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,981
You know, kids don't scare me.

790
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,515
And if he's lonely,
I know how to get him...

791
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:16,254
a brother or sister
to keep him company.

792
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,903
This is Heaven.

793
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:35,913
And I never thought I'd make it.

794
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,414
It's not bad on a good day...

795
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,575
but it's no good on a bad day.

796
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:43,519
California...
now, that's the place for us.

797
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:47,046
The sun shines there
24 hours a day.

798
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,024
Dreamer.

799
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:51,756
It's a lucky woman
who catches a dreamer.

800
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:55,322
Why did you come back here, Tom?

801
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,959
From America.

802
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:01,266
Fate, I suppose.

803
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:19,789
Holy"-

804
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:24,057
Look out, we're sinking!

805
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:43,639
Let's go. I'm frightened.

806
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,198
Tara, come here.

807
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,542
No. We mustn't be
caught together, Tom.

808
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,575
Down by the lake.

809
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:55,051
Then into the hay with them.

810
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:58,646
Naked to the world. Aye.

811
01:10:58,688 --> 01:11:01,214
Her hair spread out.

812
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:06,719
Her hair spread out.

813
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,204
That's what you call the aerial.

814
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,141
Higher! Higher, man!

815
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:03,168
Up in the air,
where the pictures are!

816
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:09,047
A pint and a small one.

817
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,019
Huh?

818
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,421
Don't make a song and dance
about it.

819
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:32,504
There.

820
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:33,703
Look at that.

821
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,939
Holy God.

822
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,846
Didn't I tell you so?

823
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,984
Like a hound out of Hell.

824
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:05,304
Can you hear me,
creature of the darkness?

825
01:14:05,341 --> 01:14:07,537
Yes, master.

826
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:10,137
Raise the needle.

827
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,980
Approach the subjects.

828
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:16,714
Flesh to flesh.

829
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:19,245
You powers
of light and dark...

830
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:21,451
invest this vestal creature...

831
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:25,792
with a gift that raises
mind above base matter.

832
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:29,493
For you,
there can be no rest...

833
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:34,834
until you have sewn
flesh unto flesh.

834
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:36,635
Begin!

835
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:42,874
Sew, creature, sew.

836
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,607
It's a fake.

837
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,479
It's candle wax or putty.

838
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,109
I wouldn't count on it.

839
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,347
No blood.

840
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:56,450
Light shall battle dark,
and dark shall be defeated!

841
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,725
Mrs. Smith?

842
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,193
I can see.

843
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,500
I can see!

844
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,703
That man is a miracle worker.

845
01:15:13,743 --> 01:15:15,677
I can see!

846
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:18,010
Nonsense. It's only a trick.

847
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:20,175
Mercy.

848
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:21,980
Sergeant,
will you do something?

849
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:24,214
Keep order, man.

850
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,724
She can see.

851
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:37,327
Thank you, sir. Bless you...

852
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:40,997
and reward you forever.

853
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:47,633
There'll be queues
at the box office...

854
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,145
for weeks to come.

855
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:52,478
He might have
a cure for the lumbago.

856
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,643
All out! All out!

857
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:57,051
See the greatest show
on earth!

858
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,350
Come along, everybody!

859
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,551
Come along, that's it!

860
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:03,491
Here we go!
The greatest show on earth!

861
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:05,255
I'm going
to shake his hand.

862
01:16:05,295 --> 01:16:07,059
Freddie P. Fitzgerald!

863
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:09,758
As seen on screen and radio!

864
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,825
Come on!
Come along, everybody!

865
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:14,667
Touch the healer!

866
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:18,038
Touch the greatest healer
in the world!

867
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:27,209
Brigid,
did you find me other shoe?

868
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:39,356
I've come to see you
on official business.

869
01:16:39,395 --> 01:16:42,023
That's...that's mine.

870
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:43,260
Give it back.

871
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,961
No. It's evidence.

872
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:47,595
I've committed no crime.

873
01:16:47,637 --> 01:16:49,628
Your playboy has.

874
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:52,369
Last winter, he served
three months in Mountjoy Jail.

875
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:55,378
Liar. Last winter,
he was in America.

876
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:57,209
He's the liar.

877
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:00,307
I telephoned Dublin Castle,
and they checked up on him.

878
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:03,547
Three months
for bigamy and desertion.

879
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:10,923
You'll be going nowhere, girl...

880
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,189
not with my child.

881
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,457
Your child?

882
01:17:13,496 --> 01:17:15,521
Marry me.
We could put in for a transfer.

883
01:17:15,565 --> 01:17:17,556
We could set up house in Dublin,
if that's what you want.

884
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,931
Please leave us alone.

885
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,527
I can see the fright
in your eyes, girl.

886
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,935
Believe me...

887
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,463
you're not half as afraid of me
as I am meself.

888
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:27,738
Brendan...

889
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:30,371
I have no feelings for you.

890
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:32,313
You don't have to love me.

891
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:34,339
I love you.

892
01:17:34,384 --> 01:17:36,512
Can't you see?

893
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:39,988
I just need you about the place.

894
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:41,923
I can't let you escape...

895
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,255
not with that fella.

896
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:47,355
Are you blind, woman?
He's a criminal.

897
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,229
A foul, dirty criminal.

898
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:51,700
Get out of my house.

899
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:53,759
God forgive me
for telling you...

900
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:56,966
but you must be saved.

901
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:18,721
There is a rational explanation
for everything on this earth...

902
01:18:18,761 --> 01:18:23,130
unless God and the Church
declare otherwise.

903
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,999
What happened
to Mrs. Smith last night...

904
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:30,871
it was the cataracts
on her eyes falling off.

905
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:35,811
The artist
has a kind of power...

906
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,074
for good or ill...

907
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:41,846
but God's power is paramount.

908
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,318
There will be
an immediate procession...

909
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:45,753
of the Blessed Sacrament
throughout the village.

910
01:18:45,788 --> 01:18:48,723
The hour of The Playboys
is past!

911
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:51,853
Henceforth, dear brethren...

912
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,988
frequent not dens of iniquity...

913
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:57,159
nor palaces of sin!

914
01:19:00,036 --> 01:19:02,198
Let's go!

915
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:26,753
What the hell
are you playing at?

916
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:31,094
Don't move, you two!

917
01:19:34,137 --> 01:19:36,162
You put the heart across me!

918
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,640
Where did
you get the explosives?

919
01:19:38,674 --> 01:19:39,835
You could've
got yourselves killed!

920
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,037
The truth, boy!

921
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,102
The Playboys, sir!

922
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:45,240
We took it out of the caravan
when he wasn't looking.

923
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:46,476
Which one?

924
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:49,410
Which one?

925
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:08,834
- You're a liar.
-Huh?

926
01:20:08,871 --> 01:20:10,999
You've never been to America
in your entire life.

927
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,237
Last winter, you were in jail
in Dublin for bigamy.

928
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:17,973
What?

929
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:19,175
Who told you that?

930
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:21,650
Who do you think?

931
01:20:21,684 --> 01:20:23,482
Tom, if you think
I'm going to gamble away...

932
01:20:23,519 --> 01:20:25,317
my future
and my baby's future...

933
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:27,345
on a chancer like you,
you're mad!

934
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,654
I picked the wrong man
once before.

935
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,524
I'm not making
the same mistake again.

936
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:33,029
Wait, Tara.

937
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:35,190
Wait until I give you
the truth of it.

938
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:38,428
It was me brother
who committed the bigamy.

939
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,094
I just took the blame
for him.

940
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:41,331
Why?

941
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,236
So he could go back
to the wife and the kids...

942
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,673
the ones he left behind
in America.

943
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,005
You're full of cock and bull.

944
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:50,013
Tara, all you have to do
is ask anyone in Dublin.

945
01:20:50,046 --> 01:20:51,605
I'm not in Dublin.

946
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,927
Is it Joe Cassidy you're after?

947
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:13,232
No. The other bloke.

948
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,106
Hold it. Hold it.

949
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:02,845
You're under arrest, man.

950
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,080
What's he done?

951
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,782
Possession of explosives,
offenses against the state.

952
01:22:06,822 --> 01:22:08,790
Aw, codswallop!

953
01:22:08,824 --> 01:22:11,794
Have you and the whole parish
gone mad entirely?

954
01:22:11,827 --> 01:22:13,727
March.

955
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,128
I know why you're doing this.

956
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:20,397
Oh, yeah?

957
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:21,961
Out with it, then.

958
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,404
Come on, man.

959
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,207
You have the guts?

960
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:30,974
No one knows better
than yourself, Sergeant.

961
01:22:31,013 --> 01:22:32,242
John-Joe, no.

962
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,612
It's about time he owned up.

963
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,710
There's your secret.

964
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:44,116
Move, you.

965
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:05,613
Your days are numbered, boy.

966
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:09,209
You'll be locked up
for ten years.

967
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:14,287
Conspiring to cause
an explosion...

968
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,959
membership of
an illegal organization...

969
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:25,256
endangering the lives
of innocent children.

970
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:32,035
He's your baby, Sergeant.

971
01:23:46,589 --> 01:23:50,753
You're not fit to touch
the hem of her garment.

972
01:24:03,773 --> 01:24:06,242
You and the other fella are
not wanted in me house anymore.

973
01:24:06,275 --> 01:24:08,676
It's too risky altogether.

974
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,203
Go away, you,
you dirty dog!

975
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:18,488
What are we going to do
without Tom?

976
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:21,115
We're banjaxed.

977
01:24:21,157 --> 01:24:23,888
He isn't an IRA man, is he?

978
01:24:23,926 --> 01:24:26,725
Freddie, he's no more
an IRA man than I am.

979
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:46,149
This afternoon,
the entire company...

980
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:48,310
will visit
the nearest picture house.

981
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:52,378
Good thinking, Freddie.
We're not beat yet.

982
01:24:56,592 --> 01:25:00,085
Can't you wait downstairs?
Father!

983
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:02,393
Now you listen to me, Tara.

984
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,229
My only concern...

985
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,257
is for the salvation
of that child's soul.

986
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:08,134
You must marry the sergeant.

987
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:11,003
He's the natural father.

988
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,134
Do you know what
I'm going to tell you?

989
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:16,270
You still owe me two quid
on that suit.

990
01:25:31,193 --> 01:25:32,718
Out of my way.

991
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,869
Tara!

992
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:38,222
Come on. Come on!

993
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:52,300
- Beautiful.
-Oh, dear.

994
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,332
I wish I could see it
all over again.

995
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,209
You will tonight
when you're in it.

996
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:59,078
Will we get away with it,
I wonder?

997
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:00,775
A civil war
in this neck of the woods?

998
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:03,080
It'll go like a bomb.

999
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,585
Clearly, Vonnie must play
Scarlett O'Hara.

1000
01:27:07,623 --> 01:27:12,083
Rachel shall take the part of
the long-suffering Melanie.

1001
01:27:12,127 --> 01:27:14,858
In the regrettable absence
of poor Tom...

1002
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:18,697
I myself will portray
Rhett Butler.

1003
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:24,628
Freddie...

1004
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,707
you're too old.

1005
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:36,251
Cassidy...

1006
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:39,084
will portray
the part of Rhett Butler.

1007
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:40,714
I, myself...

1008
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:45,851
will play...

1009
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,226
as cast.

1010
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,202
She's a little beauty, Tara.

1011
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:02,438
If she ever left...

1012
01:28:02,478 --> 01:28:06,039
this place would be
as dead as a doornail.

1013
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:43,812
Will they fetch enough
over the border...

1014
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,514
to pay our way to America?

1015
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:47,954
Will you hold your horses?

1016
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,981
You and me
aren't through customs yet.

1017
01:28:50,025 --> 01:28:52,756
If you get caught,
your brother will take the rap.

1018
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:57,255
Wait a minute, now.
It's the God's truth I told you.

1019
01:28:57,299 --> 01:29:00,132
He was desperate to see
his wife and kids in America.

1020
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:02,433
I had to help him out.

1021
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:06,840
Besides that, he slipped me
200 quid for me pains.

1022
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,809
You lying bigamist.

1023
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,108
Tonight only!

1024
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:15,242
The world famous film
of "Gone With The Wind!"

1025
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:17,514
Performed in person...

1026
01:29:17,553 --> 01:29:19,715
live on stage...

1027
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:22,122
with The Playboys!

1028
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:24,148
Adventure!

1029
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:27,754
War! Romance!

1030
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,286
Did you see that?

1031
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,687
What's Cassidy
doing in the priest's car?

1032
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:55,690
That's the least of our worries.

1033
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,284
When did you last see the truck?

1034
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:03,162
This is the customs patrol.

1035
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,599
We're banjaxed.

1036
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:07,830
We're banjaxed.

1037
01:30:26,555 --> 01:30:29,388
Let me do the talking.

1038
01:30:33,295 --> 01:30:36,265
Customs.
Anything to declare?

1039
01:30:36,298 --> 01:30:38,426
Detective Constable
Freddie Fitzgerald...

1040
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:39,764
Enniskillen.

1041
01:30:39,802 --> 01:30:42,567
We're transporting
a load of pigs.

1042
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,629
Can I see your identification?

1043
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:39,328
Rats...

1044
01:31:44,867 --> 01:31:47,461
the place is crawling with them.

1045
01:32:36,485 --> 01:32:38,180
Would you look
at the two of them?

1046
01:35:14,843 --> 01:35:17,813
It looks like somebody
is enjoying themselves.

1047
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:25,243
Laughing eyes and curly hair

1048
01:35:25,287 --> 01:35:27,415
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

1049
01:35:27,456 --> 01:35:29,550
Fare thee well, fare thee well

1050
01:35:29,591 --> 01:35:31,821
Fare thee well, my fairy fay

1051
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:34,227
We're gain' to Louisiana
Eur to see my Susyanna

1052
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:36,321
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

1053
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:38,594
A grasshopper sit-tin'
on a railroad track

1054
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:40,863
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

1055
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:43,064
Pickin' his teeth
with a carpet tack

1056
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,767
Singin' polly wolly doodle
all the day

1057
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:47,935
Act spontaneous, can't you?
improvise.

1058
01:35:47,976 --> 01:35:49,137
There's Tom.

1059
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:52,044
Thank God.
Cassidy's disappeared.

1060
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,174
There's half a packed house
waiting out there.

1061
01:35:54,216 --> 01:35:56,708
- What are they waiting for?
-"Gone With The Wind."

1062
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:59,312
Here, quick.
You're playing Clark Gable.

1063
01:35:59,354 --> 01:36:01,482
I can't play
everything myself, can I?

1064
01:36:01,523 --> 01:36:03,013
I haven't even seen the film!

1065
01:36:03,058 --> 01:36:04,958
It's the same as "Othello."

1066
01:36:04,993 --> 01:36:07,018
Boy meets girl
with a war going on.

1067
01:36:07,062 --> 01:36:09,258
If in doubt,
pretend to be wounded.

1068
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:11,265
Where's that bastard Cassidy?

1069
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,324
IRA business, I expect.

1070
01:36:13,368 --> 01:36:14,529
He is an idiot.

1071
01:36:14,569 --> 01:36:15,832
We'll still be on the road...

1072
01:36:15,871 --> 01:36:17,635
when their little squabble
is long forgotten.

1073
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:19,140
Come on, get dressed.

1074
01:36:19,174 --> 01:36:20,471
Bring those clothes, quickly.

1075
01:36:20,509 --> 01:36:23,501
Ashley...

1076
01:36:23,545 --> 01:36:25,206
Ashley!

1077
01:36:26,848 --> 01:36:29,909
I'm going to marry Melanie.

1078
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:35,156
Kiss me, Ashley.

1079
01:36:42,664 --> 01:36:45,929
You're not a gentleman, anyway.

1080
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:49,267
And you're not a lady, either.

1081
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:56,839
Oh, lawdy, lawdy.

1082
01:36:57,913 --> 01:36:59,347
Lawdy, lawdY!

1083
01:36:59,381 --> 01:37:02,078
Is you warm enough,
Miss Scarlett?

1084
01:37:06,955 --> 01:37:10,220
Why is all of them
fighting all the time?

1085
01:37:10,258 --> 01:37:12,852
They are fighting
for our freedom.

1086
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:16,257
The freedom to be slaves?

1087
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:19,494
Do I come on yet?

1088
01:37:19,534 --> 01:37:21,366
Strictly speaking, no...

1089
01:37:21,403 --> 01:37:24,338
but you may as well trot across.

1090
01:37:56,404 --> 01:37:59,032
I wasn't doing anything!

1091
01:37:59,074 --> 01:38:01,304
Jesus.
I thought it was <i>me</i> mummy.

1092
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:03,243
Sergeant?

1093
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:08,242
She won't leave without you,
me boyo.

1094
01:38:08,283 --> 01:38:12,015
For God's sake, man,
what are you--Jesus!

1095
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:15,547
You go away! Go away!

1096
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:20,928
So the saucy rebels said,
and 'twas a handsome boast

1097
01:38:20,962 --> 01:38:25,058
Had they not forgot, alas,
to reckon with the host

1098
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:28,832
While we were marching
through Georgia

1099
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,895
Hurrah, hurrah

1100
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:32,839
We bring the jubilee

1101
01:38:32,874 --> 01:38:34,865
Hurrah, hurrah

1102
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:36,844
The flag that makes you free

1103
01:38:36,878 --> 01:38:41,076
So we sang the chorus
from Atlanta to the sea

1104
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:45,417
While we were
marching through Georgia

1105
01:38:45,453 --> 01:38:47,512
To be quite honest, honey...

1106
01:38:47,555 --> 01:38:50,991
I don't give a twopenny damn.

1107
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:10,374
He's stolen the baby!

1108
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:13,814
Sergeant Hegalty,
he's stolen the baby!

1109
01:39:14,983 --> 01:39:16,883
There he is, Tara! There!

1110
01:39:19,888 --> 01:39:21,856
Sergeant!

1111
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:24,291
Hand him over. Come on, man.

1112
01:39:24,326 --> 01:39:26,226
Move an inch,
and you'll be sorry.

1113
01:39:26,261 --> 01:39:27,490
Hand him over.

1114
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:29,463
You'll all be sorry.

1115
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:32,432
You'll be
sorry most of all, Tara.

1116
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,959
I love you.

1117
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:38,039
Please.

1118
01:39:38,073 --> 01:39:39,302
Please.

1119
01:39:39,341 --> 01:39:41,241
Brendan, whosoever harms
one of my little ones...

1120
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:43,836
shall be cast into
everlasting fire.

1121
01:39:54,022 --> 01:39:57,014
For God's sake,
lads, will you stop it?

1122
01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:58,548
Right.

1123
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:06,233
Yeah. That's it.
Come on.

1124
01:40:13,742 --> 01:40:15,904
If the passion of the people
could be bottled...

1125
01:40:15,944 --> 01:40:17,969
we could all of us
sail to the moon.

1126
01:40:25,854 --> 01:40:28,482
Come on! Get in there!

1127
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,082
Come on, Sarge.

1128
01:40:32,494 --> 01:40:33,791
Come back to him.

1129
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:36,126
Come back, come back.

1130
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,861
Stop it, Brendan. Stop it!

1131
01:41:01,956 --> 01:41:04,254
Come on, Sergeant.
Get up, get up.

1132
01:41:05,427 --> 01:41:07,987
- Get up!
-Hit him, Tom!

1133
01:41:08,029 --> 01:41:09,258
Get up!

1134
01:41:09,297 --> 01:41:12,756
If I was sober, you'd be dead.

1135
01:41:13,802 --> 01:41:16,863
You'd be dead if I was drunk.

1136
01:41:16,905 --> 01:41:19,567
Give it up, Sarge.

1137
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:36,281
Help me, can't you?

1138
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:59,590
We came lighthearted.

1139
01:43:59,634 --> 01:44:03,696
Lighthearted we shall depart.

1140
01:44:36,804 --> 01:44:38,397
Thank you.

1141
01:44:42,277 --> 01:44:44,439
Good luck.

1142
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:56,256
Allow me.

1143
01:44:57,992 --> 01:45:00,188
Fair lady, you're in the way.

1144
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:51,136
I'm only going
as far as Dublin, mind.

1145
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:53,273
That's what
I said when I joined.

1146
01:46:21,209 --> 01:46:22,973
Good-bye!

1147
01:46:29,784 --> 01:46:31,218
Bye!
