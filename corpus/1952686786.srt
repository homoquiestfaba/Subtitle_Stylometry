1
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,205
There's a battle on the boards....

2
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,791
....with both teams really
digging for the puck.

3
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,419
Now it squirts loose,
and the Ice Wolves have it.

4
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,130
And the puck is cleared out of their zone.

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,926
And here they come!

6
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,971
Oh! What a hit!

7
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,806
Come on, boys,
use the body!

8
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,893
Take him wide, take him wide!
Rapton's flying up the ice.

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,811
Take him to the outside! Here we go.

10
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,190
He shoots! Nice save by Drah.

11
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,318
Oh! What a hit!
Oh!

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,028
What action, eh, Hank?

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,823
The Ice Wolves are just getting hammered.
Oh, no.

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,492
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

15
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,160
Ha-ha. There's a familiar chant, Jim.

16
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,370
Thompson.
And the coach is calling for...

17
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,998
...the big defenseman,
Derek Thompson.

18
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,251
And here comes
the Tooth Fairy.

19
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,170
Find a dark jersey
and hit it!

20
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,616
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

21
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,888
Ohh!
Ohh! That is an incisor!

22
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,059
I got the tooth.
I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!

23
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,565
And the Tooth Fairy,
Derek Thompson, has struck again.

24
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,326
You can't handle the tooth.
And that's the tooth...

25
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,413
...the whole tooth,
and nothing but the tooth.

26
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,290
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.

27
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,003
Open the door for the Tooth Fairy.

28
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,965
Penalty on number 14, Derek Thompson.

29
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,927
Five-minute major for boarding.
Yeah!

30
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,890
Who's the Tooth Fairy?
Am I the Tooth...? I'm the Tooth Fairy!

31
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,268
Stop it. Stop it.

32
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,521
Yeah, no, I'm not scared,
you know. I play hockey.

33
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,232
We'll go out, have a good time,
see what we make of it.

34
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,109
What's going on out here?
Come here.

35
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,153
I want you to meet
the future of our franchise.

36
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,779
Ah, new kid.
Yeah.

37
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,281
He's not gonna be here long...

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,033
...till he gets snapped up
by the Kings.

39
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,035
But listen, while he is here...

40
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,787
...your job on the ice is
to take care of him.

41
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,373
Okay. All right.
Nothing else matters, right?

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,625
Mick?
Yeah.

43
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,586
Derek, Mick Donnelly,
our first-line center. Mick, Derek.

44
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,754
He's your bodyguard.

45
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,631
What's up?
Welcome to pro hockey.

46
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,799
Yeah, is there an old-timers'
game today?

47
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,135
I didn't realize you were even
still playing, man.

48
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,386
I used to be a big fan.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,599
All right. See you later, man.

50
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,310
So I guess
that's my bodyguard.

51
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,645
Crazy.
He's a big one.

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,521
Yeah, he's a big guy.

53
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,109
Hello, Mr. Thompson!
Mr. Thompson.

54
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,987
Tooth Fairy!

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,657
Can I have your autograph?

56
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,660
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
What's your name, buddy?

57
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,371
Gabe. I'm the third-leading scorer
in my hockey league.

58
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,623
Our team won
the Mighty Mite's Championship.

59
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,000
Wow, that's fantastic.
Good for you, Gabe.

60
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,921
One day, I'm gonna play hockey
in the big leagues just like you used to.

61
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,469
You work pretty hard at hockey, do you?
Uh-huh. I play almost every day.

62
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,097
And I drive him almost every day.
Ah. Uh-huh.

63
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,556
How old are you?
I'm 8.

64
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,309
Ah, you're 8. You're 8.
Okay, well, here's the deal, Gabe.

65
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,187
So you're 8 and you're the
third-leading scorer in your league...

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,605
...behind two other 8-year-olds.

67
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,190
Well, one's 9.

68
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,401
Mm-hm. Okay.
Well, see, Gabe...

69
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,486
...somewhere in this
country, there's a 7-year-old

70
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,322
playing against 12-year-olds,
and he's outscoring them.

71
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,201
He's killing them, making them wanna
get run over by a Zamboni and die.

72
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,787
There are a bunch like
that kid in every rink.

73
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,247
When the time's right...

74
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,458
...those kids will battle it out and only
a handful of them will get signed.

75
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,502
Now let's say you do make the NHL.

76
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,046
You won't...

77
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,091
...but let's say you do.
You hit the show right out of college.

78
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,052
But the show hits you right back.
Before you can say "slap shot"...

79
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,931
...you're down to the minors with
a blown-out shoulder and nowhere to go.

80
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,685
Listen, lower your expectations.

81
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,230
That's how you're gonna be happy.

82
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,067
Tck. There you go, Gabe.

83
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,203
I want to suck your blood.

84
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,247
What? What are you looking at?

85
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,001
And laughing at?
Why aren't you afraid?

86
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,212
Because those are french fries.
No.

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,048
I can't eat French fries.

88
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,051
French fries are fatal to vampires.

89
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,890
Hey, I have an idea.

90
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,267
Can't talk. Still dead.

91
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,148
Mommy, my tooth came out.
Hey. Yay!

92
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,901
Oh, congrats.

93
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,237
The tooth fairy's gonna visit me tonight.
You bet. Let's see.

94
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,616
Oh, you are such a big girl.

95
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,951
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the Tooth Fairy.

96
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,954
I thought you said you were a vampire.

97
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,457
You got some
inconsistent mythology.

98
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,504
I have a lot of homework.
Can I be excused?

99
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,005
Yeah.

100
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,720
Mommy, it's time for you to go now
so Derek can start babysitting.

101
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,224
Not just yet.
Wanna go put your jammies on?

102
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,560
I wonder if it would help...

103
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,479
...if Randy and you had some
one-on-one time.

104
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,274
Sure, I could do that. So long as
I don't have to be alone with him.

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,572
Well, Rene's here.
Oh, a little ketchup.

106
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,865
Ooh.

107
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,159
Hmm.
Uh-oh.

108
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,163
Oh, tooth fairy.
You know what? I got it.

109
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,082
Look, I put on my pajamas.

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,418
Dracula's back from the dead.

111
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,627
Aah!

112
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,839
And your french fries
are not powerful enough.

113
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,261
What do you guys think of Donnelly?
Man, that kid is fast.

114
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,432
You mean the next Gretzky.
I love him already, like a long-Iost brother.

115
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,768
Can we just play?
It's to you.

116
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,646
Uh, I'm a little short.
He's a little short.

117
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:24,860
But this autograph that says
"The Tooth Fairy"

118
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,071
is worth 10 bucks on eBay.
Ten of these is 100 bucks, so I'm in.

119
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,782
No, you gotta pay.
It's not a socialist game, Castro.

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,661
Hey, it's me. I'm good for it.

121
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,956
I'll be right back.

122
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,125
He took his cards.
Is this guy serious?

123
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,711
Just fold so we can play.
Who takes the cards?

124
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,589
Derek, don't the kids have, like,
a piggy bank or something?

125
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,354
I'm home!
Hello, gorgeous.

126
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,689
Hey.
Hi, guys.

127
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,692
Uh, hey, Vinnie's? Some brews?
Let's do it, boys. Come on.

128
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,068
All we have
is juice box here.

129
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,323
Know what, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna
hang out, but I'll walk you guys out.

130
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,370
Mommy! Mommy!

131
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,706
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

132
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,750
What happened, honey?
My tooth is gone.

133
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,336
Well, that's because
the tooth fairy took it.

134
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,714
But there's no money. I looked.

135
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,009
Oh. Let's look together.
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

136
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,011
Ha, ha! The vampire has returned.

137
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,096
Not a vampire moment.

138
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,226
It's not anywhere.
Well, uh...

139
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,311
...I bet they took it
to weigh it...

140
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,605
...on the toothometer
to see what it's worth...

141
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,607
...before they bring
the money. Right?

142
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,276
Sure.
That's how the whole tooth thing works.

143
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,696
No. That's not how it works.

144
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:56,284
You put the tooth under your pillow,
the tooth fairy flies into your room...

145
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,453
...when you're sleeping,
takes the tooth...

146
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,957
...and leaves a dollar. Where is it?

147
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:06,044
Okay. You tell me when to stop
when the tooth fairy has been here.

148
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,798
Because I have 5, 10. I even got a 20.
Derek.

149
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,967
Stop.

150
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,221
Okay, Tess, you're a big girl now.

151
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,390
You're 6. Let's get this
out of the way.

152
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,767
There's no such thing as a too...
Sha-bang! Oh!

153
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,312
Here it is.
How did it get down there?

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,649
Oh, you must have rolled over
in your sleep and it fell on the floor.

155
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,824
I forgot. People forget.

156
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,494
So your big idea to handle it was to
tell Tess there is no tooth fairy?

157
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,998
Come on. The reason why there are
so many unhappy people in the world:

158
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,166
They're clinging to some version
of what if.

159
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,501
Okay, so dreams are bad?

160
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,337
If they lead to unrealistic
expectations, then yes.

161
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,922
This is ridiculous.
I know.

162
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,174
I'm going to bed.
No. Carly.

163
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,510
And you...

164
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,345
...are leaving.
Are...?

165
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,973
Don't get all dramatic.
I'm her mother.

166
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,143
I get to say when her childhood
fantasies end, not you.

167
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,220
What?

168
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,977
"Disbelief in fairy. Summons."

169
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,148
What? What?

170
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,000
Pbbt!

171
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,100
Yes.

172
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,569
Thompson? Derek Thompson?

173
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,823
Yes. Yes, God. It's me.
Is that you, God?

174
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,658
You're Thompson?

175
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,827
You're God?

176
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,621
No, I'm Tracy. I'm your
caseworker. What is this?

177
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,458
How disappointing.

178
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,918
Come with me, please.

179
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,214
No, thank you. Thank you.
Fairy Krishnas.

180
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,841
What are you wearing?

181
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,178
l... I don't know what I'm
wearing. What are you wearing?

182
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,347
Who is this guy?
Dream killer. I don't like your sort.

183
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,184
What'd I do? Why am I here?

184
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,227
Where am I?
No one likes your kind here.

185
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,645
No one likes your attitude.

186
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,064
The way you show up
acting strange. "Why am I here?

187
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,943
What are these giant wings?"
Hey, hey! Do we have a problem?

188
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,113
Yeah, we have a problem. You just
said, "Do we have a problem"...

189
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,990
...which has given us a problem.
Right.

190
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,200
Tracy, right?
Yeah.

191
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,910
Ah, what a pretty
girl's name you have.

192
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,119
Heh-heh.
Don't laugh at that.

193
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,830
That's strike two.
You don't wanna get to strike three.

194
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,209
Oh, yeah? What happens after strike three?
Strike four.

195
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,127
Yeah.

196
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,881
We'll get your uniform sorted out
and then we can get you registered...

197
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,467
and begin your training.
Training for what?

198
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,010
Ooh, "Training for what?"

199
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,971
You, Mr. Thompson,
are gonna spend some time...

200
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,349
...as a tooth fairy.

201
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,478
Ah.
Yeah.

202
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,523
"As a tooth fairy."

203
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,068
Someone get him, please.
Calm down, everyone.

204
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,071
He's relatively harmless.

205
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,907
Everyone all right?
Really? What are you, fairy patrol?

206
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,410
I'm 230 pounds of man. It's gonna
take more than eight fairies to get me.

207
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,247
Get your fairy hands off me.
Is this fairy etiquette?

208
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,040
All right. Okay.

209
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,084
Where were we?
Help! Wake me up!

210
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,087
I'm in a nightmare! Please!
Please, help me!

211
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,923
The nightmare's just beginning, buddy.
Ooh.

212
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,885
You want a shot at the title?

213
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,263
Is that it? You feeling lucky...

214
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,889
...punk?
Hey.

215
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,061
Maybe I am. Hold these, baby.

216
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,273
I can't see anything, give them back.
That... It was a stupid idea.

217
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,942
Oh, yeah. You want
a piece of this, huh?

218
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,110
I'm ready to go.

219
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,404
Hey.

220
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,406
You just made a big mistake.

221
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,075
No. Ooh!

222
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,869
Please. You got a magic wand.

223
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,121
You gonna pull a rabbit out of the hat?

224
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,956
Fairy fight!

225
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,459
Let's not get carried away.
Ooh! Now I got one too.

226
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,629
I'm gonna introduce you to the
Hammer brothers, Sledge and Jack.

227
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,799
Who do you want?
Who do you wanna meet?

228
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,385
Oh! I can't see. Can't see.
Oh, dear.

229
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,929
It looks like you picked
on the wrong fairy.

230
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,890
Ah! Ow! Ah!

231
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,808
I can see. Oh, magic wand.

232
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,312
Oh! Oh, my gosh,
the magic wand go bang-bang.

233
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,606
What is going on here?

234
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,909
I'll tell you what's going on.
The sugar-dumb fairy showed up.

235
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,410
He was gonna introduce me...

236
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,913
...to the Hammer brothers.
They're still in town.

237
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,957
Stop it!
You're behaving like leprechauns.

238
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,251
He has got such
a major attitude problem.

239
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,504
Oh, I'm well aware of his
attitude, believe me.

240
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,007
Hello, Mr. Thompson.
Hi.

241
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,760
Sorry about the foul-up
with your outfit.

242
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,346
Budget problems.
Tracy will take care of it.

243
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,514
Who, him? Yeah, sure.
Mm-hm. Great.

244
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:38,436
You, sir, are guilty
of disseminating disbelief.

245
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,729
Killing dreams.

246
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,774
Committing first-degree murder
of fantasy...

247
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,193
...which by fairy law...
Wait, is this because...

248
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,820
...of what happened with Tess? Listen...
Excuse me.

249
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,366
I hadn't finished speaking. Did I look
as though I had finished speaking?

250
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,534
Don't know.
Everybody's got British accents.

251
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,872
You just interrupted me again while I was
admonishing you for interrupting me.

252
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,541
Do I not look official enough?

253
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,211
I don't understand...

254
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,172
...why policemen or firemen
don't get interrupted...

255
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,882
...but you add
a pair of wings...

256
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,218
...and suddenly all manners
go out the window.

257
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,680
Shouldn't you be more in awe
of somebody with wings than without?

258
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,142
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

259
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,188
I could just fly up into the air
and do something crazy.

260
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,399
Maybe I breathe fire.

261
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,067
You don't know.

262
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,907
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
I didn't mean it.

263
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,743
That is better.

264
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,996
In order to pay your debt
to humanity...

265
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,833
...you are hereby ordered
to serve time as a tooth fairy.

266
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,752
The normal sentence
is one week...

267
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,589
...but because you have the nerve,
the unmitigated gall...

268
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,551
...to actually call yourself
a tooth fairy...

269
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,762
...thus make a mockery
of everything we stand for...

270
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,017
I'm sentencing you
to two weeks' tooth-fairy duty.

271
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,227
Ha, ha. No, no, no.
It's unfair. No.

272
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,605
Interrupting.
Interrupting again. Unbelievable.

273
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,276
Take him away. See that he's properly
outfitted and get him into flying school.

274
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,861
Uh... I'm sorry, what?

275
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,574
Oh, but first,
you get to meet Jerry.

276
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,454
Excuse me, Fairy Godmother?
I have one last question.

277
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,249
Does this tutu make my butt look big?

278
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,879
Yes.

279
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,672
Huge.

280
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,091
Ooh!

281
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,594
Egg on the face.

282
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,970
No, don't. No.

283
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,472
Come on.

284
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,520
All right.
Good. You got the male version.

285
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,107
Give us a spin so I can see.
How about I give you a spin with my fist?

286
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,942
What does that mean?
It's a threat.

287
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,820
It sounds like you're gonna...
I'll punch you in the nose.

288
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,406
You should have said that. Clearer.
What's that? Aww.

289
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,367
That is just pathetic.
Just like a child.

290
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,119
Chicken is fine.

291
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,996
I don't hate your chicken.

292
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,582
I like your chicken. I hate your brisket.

293
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,168
Yeah, I'm coming. Goodbye.

294
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,505
Never marry a leprechaun.
Oh, the dream-popper.

295
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,924
Hey. Did it make you feel good
to lie to that kid?

296
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,760
I didn't lie.
You told the kid there was no tooth fairy.

297
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,178
Right.
Liar.

298
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,722
Look, I'm sorry l...
"Sorry" is a beginning.

299
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,017
Now, if you're gonna be a fairy,
you gotta be ready.

300
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,936
Although...

301
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,687
Come here.
Hm?

302
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,231
Yeah.

303
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,192
Dude, there is a pill.

304
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,027
I mean, an amazing pill.

305
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,156
You take this pill,
you don't have to do any of this.

306
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,909
Really?
No, I was just kidding.

307
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,245
You're mad. You believed,
then I took it away.

308
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,413
Be mad at me, I don't care.
I have tenure.

309
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,957
Come on, walk with Jerry.
Pbbt!

310
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,919
Okay, here's your tool pouch.
Waterproof. A lot of compartments.

311
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,463
You can get a lot of stuff
in there. You dig?

312
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,923
Yeah.
Okay. This...

313
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,466
Pbbt!

314
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,261
This is your wand. Tooth detector,
radar jammer.

315
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,929
Keeps picking up Radio Caliente.

316
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,223
I don't know what that's about.
What's that?

317
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,683
Magic generator button.

318
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,270
Does whatever you want it to do.
But you have to believe or it won't work.

319
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:11,107
So it's pretty much useless
to humans. And this.

320
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,693
You don't ever wanna lose this.

321
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,404
What is it?
Well, it looks like an iPod adapter.

322
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,365
Right, so, what is it?
It's an iPod adapter.

323
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,284
What's it for?

324
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,161
Listening to your iPod.

325
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,914
You get a free iPod.
Did you not ask for your free iPod?

326
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,457
No. Really?
I'm just kidding.

327
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,209
Yeah, why do you
keep doing that?

328
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,045
I'm not well. I actually
just have a few months to live.

329
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,048
Oh, you're kidding.
Of course. Would I share that with you?

330
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,136
I just met you. Plus, you lie to kids.
Come on, we got business to do.

331
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,597
Invisibility spray.

332
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,016
Use it, nobody can see you
except other fairies.

333
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,603
And this, dude, trust me.

334
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,315
Shrinking paste.
You put a little on your tongue...

335
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,067
...you shrink down
to about 6 inches tall.

336
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,737
You wanna do it?
Come on, let's do it together.

337
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,114
Come on, we'll jump
into each other's hands.

338
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,784
I don't wanna jump into your hands.
Really? Come on. Let's get small.

339
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,287
Sometimes when I'm home
with the wife, right...

340
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,788
...I'll take a double hit.

341
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,583
I get down to that big.
My feet dangle in the inkwell.

342
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,461
Then when she's out,
I walk all over her body.

343
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,964
When she wakes up, there's footprints
all over. She goes, "What is this?"

344
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,426
I go, "Hey, I don't know."
See, when you're married a long time...

345
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,969
...you do stuff like this.

346
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,096
All right, let's see. What else?

347
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,724
Oh! Would you like a mint?
I made them myself. Here.

348
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,269
Hmm.
Taste them. Come on. Really good.

349
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,646
Go ahead. Taste it.

350
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,981
Yeah, sure. Great.
Help yourself.

351
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,151
These are good.

352
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,653
Yeah, these are good.

353
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,327
Dog-bark mints. Comes in very handy.
For what?

354
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,663
Cats, mailmen,
dogs that come up behind you.

355
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,624
Or if a kid you lied to comes after you.
How many times...

356
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,335
...I gotta say I'm sorry about that?
Six times.

357
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,091
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

358
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,051
I'm sorry. I'm...

359
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,137
I'm sorry, I was just kidding.
I can't believe you did this.

360
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,099
Did you play without a helmet
or something? What is with you?

361
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,686
It's like your brain is in a penalty box,
I'm telling you. And you got...

362
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,605
...the eyes of a shark,
but, like...

363
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,483
...deader. All right, listen.

364
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,902
Cat Away. Important.
If you're not a cat person...

365
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,655
...this thing will come in very handy.
Yeah. Ah!

366
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,866
I almost had a senior fairy moment.
Don't you move.

367
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,040
This is my greatest invention ever.

368
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:38,296
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

369
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,880
Yeah, right. Come on.

370
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,799
That's how it works.
How what works?

371
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,345
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

372
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,222
That's how it works.
How what works?

373
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,310
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

374
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,520
That's how it works.
How what works?

375
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,730
Never gets old.

376
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,443
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.
But you gotta learn to use your wings.

377
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,404
"Use my wings." You know
how ridiculous you sound right now?

378
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,947
Who's your hobbit friend
over here?

379
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,202
Wait. You stay here, okay?
You have to learn from the best.

380
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,415
And some dang fool
accused this guy of being the best.

381
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,542
Me and flying
is just not gonna happen.

382
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,336
I've got an old
hockey injury...

383
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,379
...so I probably got a bad, uh, wing.

384
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,424
That's one I never heard before.
Mm. How's it going?

385
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,260
What's up, man?
Want me to turn He-Man into Peter Pan?

386
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,805
Don't get me started, homey.
What is that? Your secret fairy jiving?

387
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,100
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said I've got a bad wing. I can't fly.

388
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,228
Ha, ha!
Put me down!

389
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,272
D.O.D.?
Yeah.

390
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,441
I'm cranking this baby up.
Put me down.

391
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,613
I think you're ready
to practice the F.O.A.!

392
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,323
F.O.A.?

393
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,741
What's F.O.A.?

394
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,577
Flying object avoidance.

395
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,622
I throw something at you,
you get out of the way, okay?

396
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,415
Oh, you better not
throw anything at...

397
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,460
You wanna get in
on this, Tracy?

398
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,712
Put me down! Aah!

399
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,882
Imagine these are your responsibilities
and you're avoiding them.

400
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,135
Bring it on!
Wimbledon!

401
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,057
It's Hammer brother... Ohh!

402
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,145
Raise your right hand, repeat
after me. I, fill in your name.

403
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,152
I, Derek Thompson.
Swear to uphold and perform.

404
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,655
Swear to uphold and perform.

405
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:34,161
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations.

406
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:40,668
Of a tooth fairy.

407
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,176
Of a tooth fairy.
And that I will not drink and fly.

408
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,430
Drink and fly?

409
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,765
Okay, no, that's serious. That's serious.

410
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,100
Uh...

411
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,269
That I will not drink and fly.

412
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,856
Welcome aboard. These coupons
are redeemable at the gift shop.

413
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,525
Oh, maybe I could have
a fairy bumper sticker.

414
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,236
All right, I concede. It's real.

415
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,447
Fairies do exist.
It's too late.

416
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,199
Your sentence begins tomorrow.
No, no, no.

417
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,704
No. There's gotta be a way
to postpone this, like jury duty.

418
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,790
I'm sure up here you have fairy duty
or whatever it is you have.

419
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,961
I've got a coach breathing down my neck.
I gotta patch things up with my girlfriend.

420
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,176
The interrupting thing. I'm sorry.

421
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,720
Any assignment you miss,
you get another week.

422
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,014
Huh. Hm.
And if you fail your terms of service...

423
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:39,560
...or tell anyone you're a tooth fairy,
your time will be extended indefinitely.

424
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,146
Oh, really? I'm not leaving.
Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

425
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,647
No.

426
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,233
Oh.

427
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,630
I'm sorry.

428
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,633
For what?

429
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,260
What I said last night.

430
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,138
Which part?

431
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,434
All the parts that
deeply offended you.

432
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,938
Okay? Everything I've ever said...

433
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,942
...or thought. Even before I met you.

434
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,529
Hm?

435
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,782
Hmm?

436
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,125
Wanna come in?
Heh. Oh, yeah.

437
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,337
You can spend
that one-on-one time with Randy.

438
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,468
Heh. Yeah.

439
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,305
Let me go to my car and get something,
and I'll be right back.

440
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,474
Me and Randy.

441
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,977
All right. Yeah.

442
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,371
I didn't know you could shred.
What do you want?

443
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,665
I brought you a present.
Guess what it is.

444
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,959
Is it a puppy?

445
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:31,547
No, wise guy, it's not a puppy.
It's one of my hockey sticks.

446
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,842
And now, after signed, "Your pal...

447
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,594
...the Tooth Fairy"...

448
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,347
...now it's worth a lot of money.
There you go.

449
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,853
Okay. I'm just gonna
leave it right here.

450
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,692
I bet you get a lot of chicks
with that guitar.

451
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,485
Can we stop this now?
Tck. Stop what?

452
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,988
You're just like
my mom's past boyfriends.

453
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,199
Pretending to be nice to me to impress her.
No, you're wrong.

454
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,827
I'm much better-Iooking
than your mom's past boyfriends.

455
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,540
Big-boy pound
for trying to break the ice.

456
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,711
No? It's going away.
I have to get back to practice.

457
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,214
How about you come over to my place,
I could break out my old drum kit...

458
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,551
...you could bring your guitar,
and we could have a jam session.

459
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,721
How about I just go tell my mom
you're actually pretty cool...

460
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,016
...and you stop trying to bond with me?
I'll take that deal.

461
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,062
So you'll never believe what Randy said
about you after you left.

462
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,815
He said that you were
actually pretty cool.

463
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,151
Well, I am pretty cool.

464
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,528
I'll say.

465
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,909
Well, whatever you're doing is working.
So why don't you keep it up?

466
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,916
Whoo.

467
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,923
Hm. Who's "T"?
I have no idea. I don't know.

468
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,884
What I do know is I would love
for you to close your eyes...

469
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,095
...because I have
an amazing surprise.

470
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,347
Really? Okay.
Oh, yeah.

471
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,932
Close your eyes.
Okay.

472
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,267
All right. Be right back.

473
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,231
Is my surprise 6-foot-3
with dark-brown eyes?

474
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,275
Oh, you'll find out shortly.
I love surprises.

475
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,071
Get ready.

476
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,787
Oh, I know you're right
in front of me.

477
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,914
Keep your eyes closed.
Okay.

478
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,961
Don't look. Everything's okay.
Oh! Oh!

479
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,130
Don't peek.
Okay.

480
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,469
I need some air.
What?

481
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,388
I'm not feeling well.
Should I come...?

482
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,889
No! No.

483
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,976
Can you give me some Pepto?
Of course, where is it?

484
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,603
It's upstairs in the bathroom.
It's way...

485
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,398
...upstairs.
Oh, my gosh.

486
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,985
Hello?
Hello.

487
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,154
Who is this?
It's me. It's Tracy.

488
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,614
Tracy who?
Tracy, your caseworker.

489
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,908
Your first assignment
has just fallen asleep...

490
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,412
...so get yourself over quick
to 663 Shelter Cove.

491
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,748
I thought that was a dream.
Think again.

492
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,916
Derek?
Oh, no! No.

493
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,335
Where are you?
Bushes. Don't come any closer.

494
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,672
You can't see me like this.
It'll ruin your romantic image of me.

495
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,425
Oh, honey. You are so sick.

496
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,469
Oh. Whew. Mm-hm.

497
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,345
Yeah.
I checked the entire bathroom.

498
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,722
I couldn't find anything.

499
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,016
Look underneath the sink.
Underneath the sink.

500
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,810
Way back deep
underneath the sink.

501
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,146
Okay.
Hello?

502
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,565
You heard the rules.
You can't miss an assignment.

503
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,193
Plus those wings will stay
until you get that tooth.

504
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,861
Oh, man.

505
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,697
You could clean up a little.

506
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,418
My wing.

507
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,505
Ah!

508
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,387
Delicate. Well done.
I can't believe this is happening.

509
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,224
It is happening, so get in
the house and fetch the tooth.

510
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,892
No, no. I'm not going anywhere.

511
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,894
Why don't you go in?
Uh, it's not my job.

512
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,231
That doesn't make sense. You're a fairy.
You go in and get the tooth.

513
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,733
I'm not a winged fairy.
I'm a caseworker fairy...

514
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,652
...which involves more responsibility.

515
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,488
There's a lot of filing and putting stuff
in envelopes. It's tricky.

516
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,366
Ah. So you're saying
you're not good enough.

517
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,660
I'm not.
And they stuck you behind a desk.

518
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,328
No, I'll tell you what they did.

519
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,581
There's a lot of wing discrimination
in the workplace. Very funny.

520
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,209
How you gonna get the tooth?
Maybe I'll wing it.

521
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,254
Brilliant. How are you gonna get in?
On a wing and a prayer. Ha, ha, ha.

522
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,215
This is very funny stuff.
Which wing of the house...

523
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,384
...should I start with? Ha, ha, ha.
Want another week?

524
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,928
No. No, no.
I don't want another minute of this.

525
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,098
So, what do you suggest, Einstein?
I can't fly, so do what?

526
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,184
How about you shrink yourself down
and slide under the door?

527
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,271
Just shrink and slide in.
Yeah, that's what anybody would do.

528
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,730
It is, actually, okay?

529
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,444
Is this gonna hurt?
Let's hope so.

530
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,783
Come on.
And how do I get big again?

531
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,911
It's automatic. From the moment
you shrink, you start to regrow.

532
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,998
It normally takes about an hour.
Come on.

533
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,420
I can't believe this.

534
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,463
Eat it.
Shut up.

535
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,300
Down the hatch.

536
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,929
Yum, yum, in Derek's tum.

537
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,687
Nice?

538
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,566
Oh, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

539
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,113
Ooh, not so brave now, little wee man.

540
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,158
No, no, no!

541
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,161
Wing jokes aren't so funny now.
The shoe's on the other foot.

542
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,706
Okay. Okay.
You should shoe me some respect.

543
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,291
I'll shoe you some respect.

544
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,210
When I get bigger, I'm gonna slap
the glasses off your face!

545
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:05,839
You "shoe-dn't" upset me.
Is that the best you got?

546
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,008
Mm. Just take the money.

547
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,677
Hey, watch it!
Don't throw money!

548
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,181
Eh.

549
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,022
My wing. My wing.

550
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,110
Money's heavy.
Money's heavy.

551
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:23,834
I hate this. I can't believe...
Oh, my wing. My wing.

552
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,112
Okay.

553
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,741
No, no. Shh, shh, shh!

554
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,952
I'm the tooth fairy. Shh!

555
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,164
The tooth fairy. No, no, no. Shh!
Aagghh!

556
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,376
It's okay, buddy, we're coming.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

557
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,212
What's going on? What is it?
Darling, we're coming.

558
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,340
What's going on? Are you okay?
Ow.

559
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,510
Honey, what's the matter?
I saw something.

560
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,721
What did you see?
It was a little tiny man.

561
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,142
Hope you're not hungry.

562
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,146
Nice kitty.
Don't hurt me, kitty.

563
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,383
I'm the tooth fairy! Ah!

564
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:22,095
Disappear! Kitty, be gone!

565
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,302
Derek?

566
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,929
Carly?

567
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,555
Come cuddle with me.

568
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,766
No.
What?

569
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,811
Going to bed. Still not well.
Hey.

570
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,065
I'll call you when I'm bigger.
I mean better.

571
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,277
Hello, fans. I'm Steve Levy
coming to you from the wolf den...

572
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,781
...here in Lansing, Michigan,
home of the Lansing Ice Wolves.

573
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,576
We are about to see
the potentially historic debut...

574
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,620
...of an 18-year-old phenom.

575
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,624
Mick Donnelly is just about set
to take the ice for the first time.

576
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,417
You pumped up for
your first game?

577
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,169
Yeah, pops,
I'm super pumped.

578
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,005
It means one less game
until I'm out and into the bigs.

579
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,590
I'm done being generous.

580
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,676
This is my kingdom.
You're in my kingdom.

581
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,136
I'm the king.
You know what you are?

582
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,264
You're like one of those
little guys in tights...

583
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,224
...who run around the court
in a poofy wig.

584
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,442
Mick the Stjck!
Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick!

585
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,053
Looks like you've been dethroned.

586
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,729
This is it. Final minute regulation time.

587
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,356
The Ice Wolves lead
the Roughnecks two to one...

588
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,984
...and the kid Donnelly
has lived up to the hype.

589
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,736
He's still working on that hat trick.

590
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,239
The puck comes back to the Roughnecks.

591
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,158
There's a quick shot. Nice save.

592
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,703
The puck goes into the corner,
and Donnelly's picked it up. Oh!

593
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,955
Now he puts on the brakes
and spins out of trouble.

594
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,750
Whoa! Look at him fly, Jim.

595
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:01,421
He fakes another defender,
and here he comes.

596
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,256
Donnelly's rushing up the ice.

597
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,508
Oh-ho-ho!
Look at those moves.

598
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,928
He's going through the Roughnecks
like they're a bunch of rented mules.

599
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,431
Donnelly circles around
the Roughneck goal.

600
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,768
He looks out front to pass.
Now he kicks it off the board.

601
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,776
Now Donnelly clears himself
off the boards and takes a pass in the slot.

602
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,195
He looks to shoot!

603
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,615
Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick!

604
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,454
No, not now.

605
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,082
Oh! Whoa!

606
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,584
Ohh!
Ohh!

607
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,713
What a bone-crushing open-ice hit
to Donnelly. And he's down.

608
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,924
Thompson was gonna clear Lembeck out...

609
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,469
...and suddenly instead, he just dropped
to the ice. No one even touched him.

610
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,981
Hey, Thompson. You cost me a hat trick
and an interview on ESPN.

611
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,818
Hey! Get over here.
I wanna talk to you.

612
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:13,618
Hey! What are you doing?
Get out here.

613
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,580
No, no, I'm very busy right now.
No autographs. I'm busy.

614
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,250
Fine. I'll wait.

615
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,168
What are you guys
talking about?

616
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,671
Whoa!
What the heck?

617
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,340
What's he wearing?
Check out Thompson's feet, boys.

618
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,675
Whoa, Derek!

619
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,681
He looks like a little girl hockey player.

620
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,849
Disappear.

621
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,310
No, no, no. Either you come out
or we're coming in.

622
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:40,854
Yeah.

623
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,107
One.
This is not good.

624
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,692
Two.

625
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,154
Three! Aah!

626
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,833
What happened? Why are you late?
Where have you been?

627
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,461
Don't talk to me. Shut up.
Why are you wet? Ugh!

628
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,089
And I hate this job.
What's that smell? That's intense.

629
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,884
I can't breathe.
That's too much.

630
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,887
It's making my eyes hurt.

631
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,972
Hello.
Hi.

632
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,893
What the...?
Mom, I'm home.

633
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,564
Where's the kid?

634
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,574
Be nice. Be respectful.
I just came out of a toilet.

635
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,368
Do you think I care? Ah, mama
fairy. There is your tooth.

636
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,873
You do whatever it is you do
here in fairy world with your teeth.

637
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,375
Mr. Thompson,
according to your caseworker...

638
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,086
...you're not exactly embracing
the tooth-fairy spirit.

639
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,380
Really? Is that what my caseworker said?
No.

640
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,424
You called her.
Let me tell you something.

641
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,092
My caseworker here
has wing envy.

642
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,427
Not true.
It is true.

643
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,721
I am a giant fan of all
the administrating.

644
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,473
You hate this job.
I live for it.

645
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,684
No, you don't. You hate this.
Will you two stop it?

646
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,104
Just look at what you
have done to this family.

647
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,609
Who are you?
Who are you?

648
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,196
I don't know.
Am I home yet?

649
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,533
Ah-ah-ah!

650
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,580
It's not funny.
See the dog? His eyes were like that:

651
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:26,417
You overdid it.
Fairy Godmother, who is your supervisor?

652
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,254
Who's above you? Gandhi?
Who do I talk to?

653
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,465
I wanna file a complaint now.
You have another assignment.

654
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,426
Are you kidding me?
Sometimes there's a double-header.

655
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,096
Tell me where the tooth is
so I can get it and go home.

656
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:42,433
Oh, no, not until the child falls asleep.
Till then, I'm afraid you have to wait.

657
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,400
Come on. I saved you a seat.
Okay.

658
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,574
One kid falls asleep in the afternoon.
Another kid's up all night.

659
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,354
Oh, I love a cup of tea.

660
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:33,151
Mm. Good tea?
Refreshing.

661
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,340
Oh, bull...

662
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,388
Hi. You feeling
any better?

663
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,516
Yeah, a little bit.
How about you guys come on up?

664
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,727
Hi, Derek.
Hi, gorgeous.

665
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,230
Actually, I have a really
big favor to ask.

666
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,858
Tess and I just got
a last-minute invitation...

667
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:17,487
To a beauty makeover party!
Nice.

668
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,364
A beauty makeover party.

669
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,283
I was wondering, because you're
getting along so well now...

670
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,411
...if Randy can hang out
with you for a little while.

671
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,708
Please?

672
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,213
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

673
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,216
Super, thank you.
I'll make it up to you.

674
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,678
Be good. Have fun.
Bye.

675
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,765
That's awesome.

676
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,120
I can see hockey's been
really good to you.

677
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,545
Do you wanna hang with me or do
you wanna go get a beauty makeover?

678
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:23,094
Pretty cool stuff in here, huh?
Yeah. Whatever.

679
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,388
Why don't you take one down,
see how it sounds?

680
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,306
I don't want to.

681
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,434
No, here. Give it a shot.

682
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,644
Please. Don't.
Give it a shot.

683
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,730
Let's see how it sounds.
Go ahead.

684
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,031
That sounds great. Uh, I'm gonna go
check out the drums and the sticks.

685
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:49,120
In the meantime, you just keep practicing
because all that is just awesome.

686
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,682
Hi, Randy.
Hey, what's up?

687
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,185
You sound pretty good.
Thanks.

688
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,146
You gonna play in the talent show?
Kelly!

689
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,023
There you are.

690
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,858
Why you talking
to emo boy?

691
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,612
Don't be a jerk, Ben.
Your dad's waiting. We have to go.

692
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,948
Bye, Randy.
Bye.

693
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,536
Don't think about talking to her.
You got it, loser?

694
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,830
Okay.
You should put this away...

695
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,123
...because you stink.

696
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,921
What are you doing with Randy's guitar?
I don't know.

697
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,341
So you should give it back to him.
Okay.

698
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,720
Now you can get out of here.
Beat it.

699
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,523
Oh-ho-ho!

700
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,734
You are in trouble now.
We'll see.

701
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,279
Oh, I know we'll see.
Can you beat two pair?

702
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,989
Call me and find out.

703
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,408
Ooh. Big boy puts in
all his big-boy Doodles.

704
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:14,247
Look of that. Me too. I'm not scared
because it's aces over kings. Ha, ha, ha!

705
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,500
Flush.
No.

706
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,337
Yes. Look at all these Doodles,
and they're all mine.

707
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,713
Nice.
Mmm. Yeah.

708
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,341
I'm gonna enjoy these.
Don't rub it in.

709
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,179
Can I ask you something?

710
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,313
It's about your body
and how it's changing, isn't it?

711
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,732
What?
Everything that's happening to you...

712
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,609
...and your body now is natural.

713
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,444
Are you growing...?
Ew, ew. No. No.

714
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,446
Do you have a funny feeling...?
Stop.

715
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,991
You'll start to grow...
Ew! No. Stop talking.

716
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,120
Okay, okay. Well, you...
That wasn't what I was gonna ask at all.

717
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,788
Okay.
It wasn't even close.

718
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,876
Okay. All right. Big-boy pound
for not wanting to talk about puberty.

719
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,423
Ew. Ugh. Oh.
Right? Yes, thank goodness.

720
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,466
Believe me, I don't wanna
talk about it either.

721
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,762
All right. What's up, seriously?

722
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,306
All right. Well...

723
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,143
...there's this talent show
coming up at my school and...

724
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,352
Okay.

725
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,189
My mom thinks I should play in it,
and I'm kind of...

726
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,984
I don't know.

727
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,613
Well, maybe you should play in it.

728
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,989
Yeah?
Yeah.

729
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,285
Yeah, you will be great. I heard
you play. You're really good, man.

730
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,955
And the chicks,
they love guitar players.

731
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,457
Mm-hm. Heh.

732
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,835
We're back!
Hey, baby. We're up here.

733
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,588
Don't tell your mom
I said that about girls.

734
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,091
Hi, boys. How'd it go?
Hi.

735
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,260
Well, your son cheats.
Does not.

736
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,514
He absolutely does, and you look...
Gorgeous!

737
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:57,975
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

738
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,270
You guys hungry?
How about we get supper?

739
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,189
Love to.

740
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,610
Where's your coat, hon?

741
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,406
Oh, no.

742
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,034
Uh, you guys gotta go.
Is someone hurt?

743
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,453
No, not hurt in a way
that you have to be worried.

744
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,164
Both of you look beautiful.
I'll call later. I'm sorry.

745
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,041
Okay...
Bye.

746
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:27,004
Shrinking paste? Nope, not
that again. Amnesia dust? No.

747
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,423
Flying? Ha.
Bad wing, forget it.

748
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,719
Oh, hey, and by the way, your
all-purpose magic generator button.

749
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,055
It doesn't work. It's broken.

750
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,182
Here's an idea, brain-box.
Why don't you...?

751
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,768
Don't touch my pouch.
All right. That was too much.

752
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,646
What do you want?
Get out the magical invisibility spray.

753
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,481
Okay? That's relatively
idiot-proof.

754
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,650
Yeah, I know that.

755
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:55,074
Ignore my last comment.

756
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,753
Hey, what a surprise. It doesn't work.
Your stuff stinks.

757
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,881
Nice.

758
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,591
Shame it wears off.

759
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,895
Earthquake.
Uh-oh.

760
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,480
Did you hear that?
Yes!

761
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,525
Ghosts!

762
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,527
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

763
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,782
Are you lost? Can we help you?

764
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,619
How would you like a little amnesia dust?

765
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,545
Where am I?
Just go to the white light, my friend.

766
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,464
Just go
to the white light.

767
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,592
Nice doggy.

768
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,970
Don't hurt me, doggy.

769
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,432
What is this?

770
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,978
It's a long and delightful story.
Where's the tooth?

771
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,773
Can I get a little help here?

772
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:12,151
That'll be all.

773
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,242
You might just be
the worst tooth fairy ever.

774
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,745
By the way, I need some more stuff.
Stuff?

775
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,831
Stuff. The magic powder, the gunk.
I need some. Notify Q.

776
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,251
No. No more stuff.
Well, that's brilliant.

777
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,545
I have a week and a half left.
How am I supposed to do that?

778
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:35,174
Sorry, we're running very low on funding.
And would you like to know why?

779
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,760
No, not really.

780
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,305
Because children aren't believing
as they used to.

781
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,016
Oh, it's not just us.

782
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:49,522
It's unicorns, leprechauns, dragons,
all those departments. Completely gone.

783
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,857
If this trend continues...

784
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,652
...Tooth Fairyland will cease to exist.

785
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,740
No child will ever again receive
a visit from a tooth fairy. Ever.

786
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,034
No more visit from the tooth fairy.

787
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,036
So what?

788
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,457
You really don't get it, do you?

789
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,835
You don't see
that children's fantasies...

790
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:14,296
...their abilities to imagine, are important?

791
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,049
Why, it nourishes their very souls.

792
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,802
It's the foundation
that allows them to dream.

793
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,555
Dreams are bad. They're bad.

794
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:24,723
They're useless.

795
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,769
You're done.
For the week.

796
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,396
No, for the night.

797
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,273
Unless you wish to stay for fairyoke.

798
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,568
Oh, my. No.

799
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,865
Fairyoke. Like karaoke
isn't bad enough.

800
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,618
Psst.

801
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,455
Me?

802
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,333
I got what you need.

803
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,588
What's that?
The goods...

804
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,381
...the stuff, package...

805
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,716
...the bag, the bomb...

806
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,428
...the juice, the bing, the bang,
the Frisco special...

807
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,929
...pink lady, little drummer boy...

808
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,390
Uh, who are you?
Ziggy.

809
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:09,393
You can call me whatever you want.
Zigman, Zigmeister...

810
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,354
Please stop talking.
You know, they want you to fail.

811
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,857
What?
Think about it.

812
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,067
You fail, they tack on more time.

813
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:21,030
It's like credit-card debt, man.
They just wanna keep you paying forever.

814
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,950
Yeah?
You really wanna play that game?

815
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,537
So, uh...?
A thousand bucks.

816
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,208
Thousand bucks? You're killing me, Ziggy.
How bad do you want this to end?

817
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,630
Can I write you a check?

818
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,806
Oh, my goodness.

819
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,977
You can see me?

820
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,605
Oh, man.
This better work.

821
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,899
Oh, no.
What is that?

822
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,818
Aah! What are you doing?

823
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,332
What did Ziggy give me?

824
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,418
Big head! Really big head!

825
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,836
Aah!

826
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,006
Just stay calm.
911? 911?

827
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,759
I just need the tooth.
There's an alien on my porch.

828
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,105
You are amazing.

829
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,942
Lily is ticked off because she had to send
another fairy to clean up your mess.

830
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,153
I learned my lesson.
Never buy black-market stuff.

831
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,657
I can't go another two weeks without it.
Yes, you can, friend.

832
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,451
You just have to surrender
to a higher power...

833
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,997
...and take it one day at a time.
Hello?

834
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,624
Caseworkers decide
who can see us and who can't.

835
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,168
Which you'd know,
if you ever paid any attention...

836
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:02,047
...ever listened to anything I say,
but no. You're always, "Yap, yap, yap."

837
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,384
Ha, ha! Shut up.
Hey. My friend.

838
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,636
You really need
to get yourself cleaned up.

839
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,888
If you want,
I can give you a pamphlet.

840
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,641
Oh, and FYI,
your sentence has been extended.

841
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,810
Lily tacked on another week,
so well done.

842
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:19,356
Great. Just what I need.
I think it is what you need, friend.

843
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,859
Listen, I can give you
fresh supplies right now.

844
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,611
On one condition:
From now on, you follow the rules.

845
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,490
You embrace the fairy spirit.
And you start listening to old muggins here.

846
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,660
Fine. I'll be the best
tooth fairy ever.

847
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,167
You keep running out on me
to see l-don't-even-know-who.

848
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,795
And then you never call,
and when I do finally hear from you...

849
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:47,051
...it's to bail you out of jail.
What's going on with you?

850
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,430
I wanna tell you, but I can't.

851
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,932
Why not?
l...

852
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,602
I just can't.

853
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,689
Tsk. I know what this is.

854
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,275
This is you acting out.
You're afraid of commitment.

855
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,444
You're nervous about us
getting serious.

856
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,906
Yes. That's it.

857
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,242
You know me so well. I'm nervous
about how serious we're getting.

858
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,578
What?
Mmm. Um...

859
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,163
Mm-hm.

860
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:23,796
You're a woman. And frankly,
you wouldn't understand.

861
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,465
What?
Whoa. Ugh.

862
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,467
No. I...

863
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,471
No, I'm not nervous
about us getting serious.

864
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,307
I wouldn't even think about
getting serious with you.

865
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,476
What?
Ooh. Mm-mm.

866
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:46,068
I freaked.
And, Carly, I love you so much.

867
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,488
I'm scared of messing up
and I'm scared of losing you.

868
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,240
Aww.

869
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,828
I understand.

870
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,455
I'm so glad you could
share that with me.

871
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,500
Where can I get some of that?

872
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,170
What are you doing?
Are you oiling up your abs again?

873
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,548
I'm coming!
Hurry up.

874
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,341
Hey, I've been stepped on...

875
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,135
...flushed, bitten and arrested.

876
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,888
Will you stop complaining?
You promised to embrace the fairy spirit.

877
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:18,350
Oh, I'm embracing
the fairy spirit, all right.

878
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,477
But I'm doing it...

879
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:26,024
...my way.

880
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,694
Hmm, I'm not sure that's in the rules.

881
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,029
Oh, yeah.

882
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,646
Shh.

883
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,357
I'm just here for the tooth, sir.

884
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,109
Just the tooth.

885
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,405
I'll take my glove away. Shh.

886
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,743
That's it.

887
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,913
Now, just hand over the tooth.

888
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,248
Nice and easy.

889
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,921
Let it go.

890
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,756
I said, let it go.

891
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:36,094
Very good. You have a good night, sir.

892
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,435
Hey.

893
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,773
Who are you?

894
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,943
I'm the tooth fairy.

895
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,863
Oh, yeah.

896
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:05,374
You got it? Let's go. All right, Mick,
how's life in Lansing so far for you?

897
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,793
It's been good.
I'm the new blood of the team.

898
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,463
Some of these wolves are getting
long in the tooth, if you know what I mean.

899
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,550
When you say "long in the tooth,"
that would be a reference...

900
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,468
...to Derek Thompson,
the Tooth Fairy.

901
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,804
It's not a rivalry, you know.
I respect my elders.

902
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,597
Has Thompson taken you under his wing?

903
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,474
No, man, his wings are tattered.

904
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,644
My wings are new and ready to fly,
and I like to do my own thing.

905
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,354
A confident, young hockey player.

906
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,398
Good luck this afternoon.
Thank you.

907
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,943
The Ice Wolves dump
the puck and look to make a line change.

908
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,112
Mick, get ready!
Finally.

909
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,656
Hey, good luck out there, buddy.
Okay.

910
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,866
No, I mean it.
I think you're gonna do great.

911
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,786
You're the bestest hockey player ever.
Whatever.

912
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,163
Mick, change, change!
Hit him, hit him!

913
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,082
Yeah.
Come on, Floyd.

914
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,293
Donnelly jumps into the play...

915
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,129
...and takes a cross-ice pass.
The Ice Wolves...

916
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,508
...charge across the blue line. Big scrum
in front of the net as these two rivals...

917
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,303
...start to get a little feisty
with each other.

918
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,365
Oh, yeah. Heh-heh-heh.

919
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,701
All right. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.

920
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,788
The puck goes into the corner,
where Nubin chases it down.

921
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,625
What's the matter with him?
What's up with Donnelly?

922
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,376
Get in there, Donnelly! Get in there!

923
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,173
The puck squirts loose.
Now Donnelly picks it up...

924
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,675
...skates to the point,
looking to set up a play.

925
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,178
Bring it up. Bring it up.
Hi.

926
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,680
Oh! Donnelly takes a terrible fall.

927
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,891
What happened there, Jim?
Who hit him?

928
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,018
Someone hit him?
Anyone know who hit him?

929
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,437
What is going on?

930
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,028
What is he doing?
Stop it.

931
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,114
Is he laughing?

932
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,247
Donnelly, you okay, kid?

933
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,334
What?

934
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,004
Are you trying to test me, kid?
Get off the ice!

935
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:19,549
Listen, you wanna play games?
You can head over to the daycare center.

936
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,468
Get out of here. Right now.
Move it.

937
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,142
So, what'd I miss?

938
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,525
Why you bark?

939
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,289
I'm not gonna be ready.
I'll get up there and blow it.

940
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,709
You'll be fine.
We just gotta keep practicing.

941
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,545
Everyone's gonna laugh at me.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

942
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,422
Well, maybe they will...

943
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:02,884
...or maybe you'll blow
the roof off the place, huh?

944
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,888
Man, you're good. But you're
not gonna find out if you quit.

945
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,058
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

946
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,145
Yeah? When was the last time
you took a shot?

947
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,237
Listen, when I first started,
I was a scorer.

948
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,115
First-round draft pick of the Devils,
playing in the bigs.

949
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,660
So, what happened?
I busted my shoulder one night in Chicago.

950
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,788
They sent me down to the minors
to recover, and it took forever.

951
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,415
I got so angry and frustrated.

952
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,334
One night, I got into it
with some meathead from New Haven.

953
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,004
Knocked out a couple of his teeth,
crowd went crazy...

954
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,383
...and they started calling me
the Tooth Fairy, and it stuck.

955
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,637
And I haven't scored in years.

956
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:56,980
But I've got more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league. Yeah.

957
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,275
But, like, isn't your shoulder
all healed now?

958
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,444
It's just not the same.

959
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,322
But how do you know?
You don't even try.

960
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,326
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

961
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,208
I'll tell you what. I will if you will.

962
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,841
Okay. I'll take that deal.

963
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:29,596
Hey.

964
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,724
All right. Thank you.

965
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,060
And another tooth.

966
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,610
Hey. That must be good.

967
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,738
That moment
when you hand over the tooth.

968
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:50,575
Not that I'm interested. Just
wondering, you know, how it felt.

969
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,829
Why don't you find out?
We've been through this. I'm not winged.

970
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,748
Okay. Explain to me one more time.
Why can't you have wings?

971
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,544
Do you know nothing about fairy evolution?
Fairy evolution. Who wrote that...

972
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,671
...Charles Darwing? Ha-ha-ha.

973
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,089
Inspired. Brilliant.

974
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,926
Um, according to fairy evolution,
some fairies can grow wings and some can't.

975
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,845
And I'm one of the unlucky ones.

976
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:13,181
Tracy, you don't have to have
wings to be a tooth fairy.

977
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,602
Hey, remember, you've got all of this.
That is true.

978
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:22,858
Somewhere in there, you gotta show them
your strengths. Speed, agility, flexibility.

979
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,277
Right.
And how am I gonna do that?

980
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,614
Around the cones, around the cones.
Quick feet, quick feet.

981
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,790
No. Come back. Come back.

982
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,711
Where you going?

983
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,629
Look at the size.
Get over the fence.

984
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,757
It's 3 feet high.
You're 8 feet tall. Go back.

985
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,139
Ah! A dinosaur!
No, it's not.

986
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,348
What the heck? Aah!

987
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,399
Come on. Over the fence.
Ah! Oh!

988
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,985
I'm all right. I'm okay.
I'm okay.

989
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,112
You okay?
No. Good night.

990
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,827
Aah! It's a child!
Why'd you hit the kid?

991
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,080
They've got matching robes.
It's my worst nightmare.

992
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,003
Don't drop me.
Yeah.

993
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,671
I got it. I got it.

994
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,466
I'm there. Ah! I'm not there.

995
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,184
You look like a beautiful
reindeer with your legs.

996
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,977
You're prancing,
you're prancing.

997
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,315
Not on the kid, on yourself.

998
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,858
Amnesia dust.
Amnesia dust.

999
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:03,875
Yeah!

1000
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,880
Dust, dust, dust. Up.

1001
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,393
You sound great. You're gonna
kill them tomorrow night.

1002
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,145
So, what do you think?

1003
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,152
Wow. Nice.

1004
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,739
That is bigtime.
Randy Harris. Talent show.

1005
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:38,076
I like that slot too.
You think I could be a famous rock star?

1006
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,620
Like Clapton or Hendrix
or Stevie Ray Vaughan?

1007
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,915
You want it straight?
Yeah.

1008
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,583
Okay.

1009
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,756
You're getting pretty good, right? So let's
say you keep working at it really hard.

1010
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,884
Then let's say you become
the best 13-year-old guitarist...

1011
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,345
...in your neighborhood.
Here's the deal.

1012
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,723
Remember there are
a lot of neighborhoods...

1013
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,766
...with a lot of
13-year-old guitarists.

1014
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,477
But somewhere, there's a
12-year-old who's shredding it.

1015
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,980
I mean, he is killing that guitar.

1016
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,445
Yeah?

1017
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,616
You know what? Yeah. It's possible.

1018
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,703
Cool.

1019
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,164
Go get them.

1020
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,959
Late in the third period,
Ice Wolves down four to three...

1021
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,380
...to the Arrows. Donnelly is getting
a breather, but having another great game.

1022
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,176
The Arrows leading scorer, Crosley,
takes the pass, and he is on the move.

1023
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,427
Mickey, your line's up.

1024
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,929
All right, old man.
Got a fresh pair of Depends on?

1025
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:42,599
Ah, you never know, kid.
I just might surprise you.

1026
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:47,103
Ice Wolves dump the puck into
the Arrows' zone, change lines on the fly...

1027
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:49,606
...as the coach throws Donnelly
back in the game.

1028
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,487
Allegheny's got the puck in their own zone.
They're crossing the blue line.

1029
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,405
Change! Change!

1030
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,160
And here comes Thompson off the bench,
replacing Goff.

1031
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,167
Ohh!

1032
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,336
Thompson knocks Crosley
flat on his back...

1033
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:14,714
...and kicks the puck in the neutral zone,
where Browley picks it up.

1034
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:19,094
Thompson jumps back into the play
as Donnelly weaves around Crosley.

1035
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:23,848
Now Thompson takes a pass right on
his stick as Donnelly flashes into the play.

1036
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:27,018
It's a two-on-one with Thompson
of all people leading the rush.

1037
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,311
Pass it!

1038
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,481
Donnelly's screaming for
the puck, but Thompson won't give it up.

1039
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,150
Pass.
Pass it! Pass it!

1040
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Pass!

1041
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,779
Thompson looks to pass.

1042
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,864
No, he fakes the pass.

1043
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,826
He's got the top shelf wide open.

1044
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:45,787
Mickey's open! Pass it!
Pass.

1045
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,375
No!

1046
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,172
What a hit on Thompson.
What is he thinking?

1047
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,804
The Arrows have numbers,
coming up the ice.

1048
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,390
They shoot, they score!
Damn it.

1049
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,894
Jim, it looked like
Thompson was actually gonna shoot...

1050
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,521
...and he just choked.

1051
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:30,582
You're not a hockey player.
You're a sideshow attraction!

1052
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:35,044
You know what? Why don't you watch
tomorrow's game from the bench?

1053
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,671
You bum.

1054
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,632
Come on, boys. Come on now.

1055
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,261
Here we go. Here we go.
Come on, let's start up.

1056
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,185
Oh, great.

1057
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,322
Hey, honey. How was your game?

1058
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,782
Uh, not good.
Derek, guess what.

1059
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,410
I have another loose tooth.
Good for you, honey.

1060
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:09,579
What's the matter, hon?
Everything.

1061
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,249
Nothing. You know, forget it.
Can we go practice now?

1062
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,252
Can we skip today's session?
I just don't have it in me.

1063
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,504
The talent show is tomorrow.
You'll be fine.

1064
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,882
I need one more run through...
No, you don't.

1065
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,969
No, I do need it. I just need a little
more practice. Just so I can get it down.

1066
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:28,973
It doesn't matter what you do in the show.
You'll never be a famous rock star.

1067
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:32,769
You'll just be another kid with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give it up.

1068
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,145
Derek.
Look, I'm sorry...

1069
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,481
...but it's for his own good. Trust me.

1070
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,610
No!

1071
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,495
Come on, Tess.
Tess, let's go.

1072
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,914
What is wrong with you?
Look, I had a bad day.

1073
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,916
Had a bad day?
I had a bad day, okay?

1074
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,918
No. No, that is not okay.

1075
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,671
You are never gonna
speak to my children again.

1076
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,923
We are done.

1077
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,259
Carly.

1078
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:09,138
You know what your problem is, Derek?
You can't say "what if."

1079
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:14,185
And you never will.

1080
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:38,710
Okay. Okay.

1081
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:43,548
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1082
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,219
Who wants to hear
some good news?

1083
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:50,471
I do. Come on.

1084
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,060
Why are you here?
Lily gave me this.

1085
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,603
Huh?

1086
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:02,066
Only a permit, but I'm on the way.
You should be on your way out.

1087
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,152
I'm going to bed.
It's thanks to you.

1088
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,780
We've gotta celebrate. I know a place
where the hot fairy godmothers hang.

1089
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:11,284
Are you out of your mind? I just lost
everything that's important to me.

1090
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:15,079
My girlfriend, those kids,
and I probably hung up my skates for good.

1091
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:18,583
All because, like an idiot,
I bought into your tooth-fairy garbage.

1092
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,084
Look where it's gotten me.

1093
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,213
You make one effort
and it doesn't work out...

1094
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,257
...and suddenly
you're just gonna give up?

1095
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,594
It's not supposed to be that easy,
and you know it.

1096
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:37,852
I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that you don't have wings.

1097
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,772
So that means you can't fly.

1098
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:45,943
That also means that you can
never, ever, ever be a tooth fairy.

1099
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,947
What happens if you try to escape
out a 10-story building? I'll tell you what.

1100
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,493
Splat, just like that.

1101
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,586
You know what's really sad?

1102
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,464
The person you hurt the most
with all your dream-killing...

1103
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,717
...is not Randy or Carly or even me.

1104
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:11,469
It's you.

1105
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,098
Get out.
Fine.

1106
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,474
Good.

1107
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,604
Fine. Ooh-hoo.

1108
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,272
I'm going to bed.

1109
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,818
One twenty-four left in the third period...

1110
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,737
...with the Ice Wolves
still trailing one to nothing.

1111
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:33,491
And Derek Thompson is still
completely in the coach's doghouse.

1112
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:37,161
I don't think he's seen a second of ice time.
Here we go, here we go.

1113
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:40,415
As he has all game,
Andreas Petrenko, the Mute Brute...

1114
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,126
...continues to replace Thompson
on the first line.

1115
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,879
Face-off won by the Lumbermen.

1116
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,507
Ohh! What a hit!

1117
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:52,969
Donnelly steals the puck, and now
he's rushing up the ice short-handed.

1118
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,013
Only Coletta can get back.
Let's go, Mick. Let's go, Mick.

1119
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,352
This is classic.
Every move Donnelly makes...

1120
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,271
...Coletta's got an answer.

1121
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,523
Donnelly shoots to his left.

1122
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,693
Oh! He's got Coletta out of position
and Donnelly moves around him.

1123
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,945
He's got the defenseman beat.
He shoots!

1124
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:13,531
Oh! Hits the crossbar.

1125
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:17,869
What happened?
They blew the whistle.

1126
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,955
Back behind the play, Jim,
Petrenko got sucker-punched...

1127
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,874
...and I don't think he's getting up.

1128
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,384
Thompson.

1129
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:37,763
Go.

1130
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,400
All right, here we go.

1131
01:14:49,568 --> 01:14:51,861
The Ice Wolves have
less than a minute to score...

1132
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,238
...and send this game into overtime.

1133
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,658
Off the face-off,
it's Plattsburgh with the puck.

1134
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,411
And they start their drive
as the clock winds down.

1135
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,872
I don't know.
It looks to me like Thompson...

1136
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,999
...is just going through the motions
out there.

1137
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,711
Oh, my!
Thompson just got leveled.

1138
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,756
How could that not be a penalty?
He just got crushed.

1139
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:19,931
I think the Tooth Fairy
just got a taste of his own medicine.

1140
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,086
Look at Thompson, Jim.

1141
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,423
He looks like he's got
some jump back in those legs.

1142
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,302
Thompson's rushing across
the ice, and I don't think it's to make friends.

1143
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,636
Well, this is gonna hurt.

1144
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:42,179
Oh!

1145
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:45,516
No! He pulled up, Jim.
He didn't throw a check.

1146
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:46,851
Incredible!

1147
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,147
He steals the puck and now is barreling
down the ice. Look at him go.

1148
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,274
Ellis can't keep up with Thompson.

1149
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,027
He's making moves
we haven't seen in a long time.

1150
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,194
Who is that guy?

1151
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,073
Thompson only has one
defender to beat.

1152
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,160
Oh! He takes the stick to the face.

1153
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,496
I think he's going down.
No, he stays on his feet.

1154
01:17:07,664 --> 01:17:09,624
He's gonna shoot!

1155
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:12,918
He shoots!

1156
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,884
He scores!

1157
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,556
Yeah!

1158
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,686
Yeah. All right, nice shot.

1159
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,361
Hi-ya! Whoo!

1160
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:41,364
Derek Thompson has not
taken a shot in nine years.

1161
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:46,077
In one of the most amazing shots
I've ever seen, it ties it up at one all.

1162
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,914
Call me the Mayor of Shockville.
Let's do it again.

1163
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,084
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

1164
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,086
Hey, old man.

1165
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,213
Not bad.

1166
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,053
Yeah, Derek.
Nice shot, dude.

1167
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,514
Way to go.

1168
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:12,561
And here we go.

1169
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:17,483
We're under 20 seconds as both teams
head to the center line for a face-off.

1170
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,991
Oh, no.

1171
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,039
The Ice Wolves win the drop.

1172
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,291
There's a cross-ice pass
to Thompson, who ices it.

1173
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:38,462
Why would he do that?
I have no idea, Jim.

1174
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,214
No, I can't leave now.

1175
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,425
This is my last chance to
actually play the game...

1176
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,051
...to go out the way I came in.

1177
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:47,138
I could cover for you.
After what I've seen, you deserve it.

1178
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:49,557
Thompson, what are you doing?
Who's he talking to?

1179
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,143
Aren't you a trainee?
Isn't that breaking the rules?

1180
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,103
Please, I've learned
from the best.

1181
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,606
But I do think you should look
at the address before you decide.

1182
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:06,031
It's Carly's house.

1183
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,118
Hey, 14. Come on. Let's go.

1184
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,162
Thompson, get back in the game.

1185
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:15,249
I can go. Lily does not have to know.
But I'll know.

1186
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:18,961
This is my house to take care of.

1187
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:45,154
Let's do this.
How? You can't fly.

1188
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,198
Good time to learn.

1189
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,283
I knew you had it in you.

1190
01:19:58,376 --> 01:20:00,211
Go get them.

1191
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:10,888
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.

1192
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,535
No need to panic.
It's just a giant amnesia gun.

1193
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,413
It's painless.
You won't remember a thing.

1194
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:25,379
Don't you forget about me

1195
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,131
You will.

1196
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,801
Good luck finding your cars.

1197
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:55,451
Psst.

1198
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,077
Tess?

1199
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,747
Derek.

1200
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:02,583
Hi, honey.
Hi, Derek.

1201
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:07,004
I like your costume.

1202
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:10,966
I have to tell you something.

1203
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,010
I was wrong.

1204
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,889
The tooth fairy is real...

1205
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,099
...and it's me.

1206
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,060
I know.

1207
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:25,189
No, honey, I'm not talking about
the hockey Tooth Fairy.

1208
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,526
I'm the real tooth fairy.

1209
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,445
No, you're not.

1210
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,710
You are the real tooth fairy.

1211
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:50,547
It'll just be our secret, okay?
Okay.

1212
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,471
Wow.

1213
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:35,759
Randy?

1214
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,597
What are you doing here?

1215
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,183
I have to talk to you.

1216
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,520
Go away.

1217
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,441
Listen, those things
I said yesterday?

1218
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,609
I was wrong.

1219
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:56,113
I don't care.

1220
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,949
You gotta keep playing guitar.

1221
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,993
You're really good.

1222
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,789
And nothing you love doing that much
could ever be a waste of time.

1223
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,793
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,181
Well...

1225
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:27,102
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

1226
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,813
I smashed my guitar, remember?

1227
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,983
Tonight is the talent show.

1228
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,363
Hold on one second.

1229
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,299
Maybe this'll help.

1230
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,842
Whoa!

1231
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:00,469
It's awesome.

1232
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,013
How...? How did you do that?

1233
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,849
All-purpose magic generator.
Wha...?

1234
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,729
What are you wearing?
You'll find out.

1235
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:14,566
In the meantime, put some clothes on.
We can still make the talent show, okay?

1236
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,777
Come on.

1237
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,491
Derek?

1238
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,829
Mommy, Derek is the tooth fairy.

1239
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:40,175
You rented a fairy costume
to make it up to Tess.

1240
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:44,805
Yes. Heh-heh. That's what I did.

1241
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:50,352
Hey, Mom. Derek got me a new guitar,
and he's taking me to the talent show.

1242
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,563
What time is it? You'll never make it.

1243
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:55,190
It's gotta...
Don't worry about that. We can make it.

1244
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:58,902
You, that way. You guys, go up and get
dressed, and we'll see you over there.

1245
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,737
Mmm.

1246
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:02,990
Oh, yeah.

1247
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:05,325
Where's your car?
No car. Let's go.

1248
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:08,912
Hang on!

1249
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,918
How is this happening?
It's okay. It's okay.

1250
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:16,712
Yeah, but, like, how is it possible?

1251
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,882
It all started one night. I got
a summons underneath my pillow.

1252
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:22,759
What the heck is a summons?
A summons is like an invitation.

1253
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,095
I got an invitation to Fairyland.
Fairyland?

1254
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:28,348
It's where I got these wings.
I met this guy up there named Tracy.

1255
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,393
He looks like a walking toothpick
with the eyes of a big tuna.

1256
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,729
By the way,
I can shrink myself down to 6 inches.

1257
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:36,398
Heh. Whoa. Heh-heh.

1258
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,400
Pretty good.

1259
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,782
What?

1260
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:51,413
I'm sorry, buddy,
but I've already broken enough rules.

1261
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,468
Randy, there you are.
We've been looking all over for you.

1262
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,012
Get in there and tune up. Come on.

1263
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,932
Ahem. Another tooth.
Thank you.

1264
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:12,184
You're welcome.
I've got a concert to get to.

1265
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:15,729
No, you skirted quite a few rules
tonight, Mr. Thompson.

1266
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,940
But I took care of Carly,
I dusted Randy...

1267
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:21,485
...and Tess, she's only 6,
so pretty soon she'll forget.

1268
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,738
And even if she doesn't,
at least now she'II...

1269
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:26,198
She'll always...

1270
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,494
Always what?

1271
01:27:34,999 --> 01:27:38,168
She will always believe...

1272
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,837
...like I will.

1273
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:46,677
I get it. Dreams are good.
For everyone.

1274
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:49,846
Oh.

1275
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,600
Mr. Thompson...

1276
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:59,773
...I hereby relieve you
of tooth-fairy duty.

1277
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:07,030
Ha, ha. You're good.
She's a pro.

1278
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,825
Congratulations.

1279
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,702
Put that away.

1280
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,412
Hmm?

1281
01:28:15,498 --> 01:28:16,540
Um...

1282
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,668
Um... Ah...

1283
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:22,713
l... I tend not to do
the whole physical contact thing.

1284
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,881
Oh, you like me.
I know you like me.

1285
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,718
You do the whole
distant administrator demeanor thing...

1286
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:30,804
...which I understand,
but somewhere in there, you like me.

1287
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,390
Ha, ha, ha. I like you, ooh.

1288
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,685
Well...

1289
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:38,478
...let's not get frisky.

1290
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,066
I really gotta go.
Yeah. Could you wait just one second?

1291
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,152
Tracy, I need another word with you.

1292
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:48,488
Uh, what's this about?

1293
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:51,658
Anybody that can rehabilitate
Mr. Thompson...

1294
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,077
...more than deserves...

1295
01:28:54,245 --> 01:28:55,412
...these.

1296
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:06,173
Are these...?

1297
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,508
It's your wings, Tracy.

1298
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:09,843
Wear them with pride...

1299
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,721
...every time you collect a new tooth.

1300
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,807
Ha-ha-ha! You're a tooth fairy, buddy.
I got my wings.

1301
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:17,434
You got your wings.
Ha!

1302
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:19,770
Here. You need this.

1303
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,856
Little bag.
I don't know why I'm speaking like this.

1304
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,151
Ah.

1305
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,446
No? Uh... Um...

1306
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,074
Thank you, milady.

1307
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:36,536
This is great and I'm proud of you.
You're the tallest tooth fairy in the world.

1308
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:39,247
But I gotta go.
Somebody's gotta poof me down.

1309
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:43,710
Tracy, would you like to do
the honors or shall I?

1310
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:48,465
Oh, so honors? Oh, a gift. Yeah.
I'm afraid not.

1311
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,303
You're not gonna remember anything
that happened in Fairyland.

1312
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:57,432
Why?
Because that's just the way we do it.

1313
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,896
I'll never forget you.

1314
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,735
I can't believe you
showed up at the rink.

1315
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,406
It's just the way we do things.

1316
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,995
Thank you, Tracy, for everything.

1317
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,668
You big four-eyed giraffe.

1318
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,336
Go back to the zoo.

1319
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,257
Oh. And you get that head back
to Easter Island.

1320
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,345
Hammer brothers are still in town.

1321
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,097
Let me meet those guys.

1322
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:43,019
You're my man.
And you are my fairy.

1323
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:46,606
Could we e-mail or something?
We should be able to e-mail each other.

1324
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:50,152
Do you blog? I'd love to read your blog.
I do blog. Wanna read my blog?

1325
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,821
Do you Facebook? I could poke you.
I'd love to be poked!

1326
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:54,781
Oh!
Yes.

1327
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:12,382
Oh, there you are. I couldn't find you.
Hi.

1328
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,719
Yeah, I was just at... I was...

1329
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,391
I am so excited.
Ha, ha, ha. Me too.

1330
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:25,228
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1331
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:27,731
Hi, honey.
Hi, Derek.

1332
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:35,780
Good job, Timmy!

1333
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:38,366
Keep it going
for our last performer of the night...

1334
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:40,952
...Randy Harris!

1335
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,169
Randy!
Whoo!

1336
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:07,604
Whoo!

1337
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,949
Go, Randy!
Yeah!

1338
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:34,649
Whoo!

1339
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,073
Way to go, Randy!
Great job!

1340
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:54,753
Yay, Randy! That's my kid!

1341
01:33:57,506 --> 01:34:00,800
Hey, I was just wondering.
What if we got married?

1342
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:06,306
Huh?

1343
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:08,725
What if we got married?

1344
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:12,896
Did you hear what I said?

1345
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,524
I said "what if."

1346
01:34:19,528 --> 01:34:21,237
Yes.
Yeah?

1347
01:34:30,289 --> 01:34:31,539
We're getting married.

1348
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,501
Yeah! Whoo!

1349
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,885
We're getting married.

1350
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,446
Good evening, everybody.

1351
01:35:03,614 --> 01:35:07,283
Welcome to Staples Center,
the home of your Los Angeles Kings.

1352
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:11,162
Now let's introduce tonight's
starting lineup for the Kings.

1353
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:16,960
At right wing, number 13, John Zeiler.
Hey, excuse me. Hey, dude! Dude!

1354
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:20,964
Hey, big daddy. Just wanna
shake your hand. I don't want anything.

1355
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,967
Excited to see you back in the NHL
right where you belong.

1356
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,469
Look at you now, huh?
Do I know you?

1357
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:29,639
No, I'm just excited to see you
because I believe in you, man.

1358
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:33,476
I believe in you, big daddy.
I believe in you, Derek Thompson.

1359
01:35:33,644 --> 01:35:36,813
In goal, number 32, Jonathan Quick.

1360
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,734
And starting at left wing...

1361
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,778
...number 40, Derek Thompson.

1362
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,657
Yes!
I got you a few of your favorite things.

1363
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,826
Oh, thank you, Jerry.

1364
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:52,495
It's not every day the boss
asks me to go off-campus.

1365
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:54,831
It's about time I got you
out of that basement.

1366
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,374
That's cool.
Did you see him?

1367
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,334
Yeah, we're fine.
Oh, I miss him.

1368
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:02,839
Oh! Yes! Knock him on his bum.

1369
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:06,009
Ha, ha, ha.
It's like a whole new you.

1370
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,928
I don't know why you like this.
You can't even see the ball.

1371
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:11,848
It's called a puck.
Yeah, but you can't even see it.

1372
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:14,350
I mean, something that small
moving that fast...

1373
01:36:14,518 --> 01:36:16,811
...it'd be so much better
to get closer to it.

1374
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,688
You know what I mean?

1375
01:36:19,982 --> 01:36:21,107
Jerry.
I'm gonna do it.

1376
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:22,609
You're not.
I'm gonna do it.

1377
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,402
No. No, Jerry.
I gotta do it.

1378
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,654
I gotta do this.
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.

1379
01:36:26,822 --> 01:36:28,239
Mm-hm.

1380
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:30,283
I'm just kidding,
I gotta do it.

1381
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,829
This is gonna be cool.

1382
01:36:35,664 --> 01:36:37,332
I love my job!

1383
01:36:40,002 --> 01:36:41,085
Huh?

1384
01:36:44,256 --> 01:36:45,965
Yahoo!

1385
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,386
Whoa!

1386
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,764
That was a rush.

1387
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:31,052
Thank you.

1388
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:57,328
I don't know why I'm speaking like this.

1389
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:26,649
Kitty, be gone!

1390
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:33,239
I hate this job.

1391
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:21,454
Good luck finding your cars.

1392
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:58,116
My wing. My wing.

1393
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:07,000
Fairy coming through.

1394
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:24,726
Ah! Ow!

1395
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,714
Ohh!
Ohh!

1396
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:25,453
I got the tooth!
I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!

1397
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:26,454
I got the tooth!
I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!
