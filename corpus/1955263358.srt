2
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,118
Mr. Rom.

3
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,326
Opa.

4
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:29,667
We found it.

5
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:40,265
Captain Moulle.

6
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:46,504
Form your lines.

7
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,725
Maxim ready, sir!

8
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,691
Steady.

9
00:03:09,265 --> 00:03:11,074
Wait.

10
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,425
Fire!

11
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,691
Stand your ground!

12
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:37,913
Chief Mbonga, I presumed.

13
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,706
How do you know my name?

14
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:44,415
You're the man I came to see.

15
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:03,739
These are what you came for.

16
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:11,461
What would you do for them?

17
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,995
Whatever is necessary.

18
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:20,823
There is one thing
I desire above all else.

19
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,302
Bring it to me.

20
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,428
Bring him to me.

21
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:29,325
And you shall have your diamonds.

22
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:35,587
All I need is a name.

23
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:57,112
THE LEGEND OF
TARZAN

24
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:16,209
His Serene Highness,
King Leopold of Belgium.

25
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,695
has extended an invitation
to Lord Greystoke,

26
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,687
to take a loyal tour
of the Congo free state.

27
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,511
To visit the schools
and churches he's built.

28
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:30,411
To acknowledge his success
of his anti-slavery initiatives

29
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:33,475
and to open trade discussions.

30
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:45,131
Lord Greystoke, let me
explain the Africa situation.

31
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:50,938
King Leopold controls the Congo.

32
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:56,370
He's defaulting on his loans and needs
a business partner to fill the gap.

33
00:08:56,395 --> 00:09:02,371
Your invitation is a perfect opportunity for
her majesty's government to get involve.

34
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:07,387
Consider the jobs we would create
for the poor natives of the Congo.

35
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,775
Ah.

36
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:14,208
- And I thought the civil war was long.
- Dr. Williams, you are a guest here.

37
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:17,725
Prime Minister, if you are
not going to say it,

38
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,987
... allow me.
You, are Tarzan.

39
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:25,684
Lord of the apes,
King of the jungle.

40
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:27,923
Me, Tarzan.
You, Jane.

41
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:31,802
Tarzan.
Tarzan...

42
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,242
King Leopold is inviting you
because you are a celebrity.

43
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,872
He wants to show you the
schools and churches he built.

44
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:40,150
You woo and aww
in front of the newspapers

45
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:44,491
and he's validated by
Africa's favourite son.

46
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:48,672
England pays his debts.
We make money.

47
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:51,467
- Ham sandwich, easy.
- Mm-hm.

48
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:54,393
So.
Your majesties.

49
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:57,623
Can we get this
show on the road?

50
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,221
No.

51
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,900
- No?
- God's sake, why not?

52
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,209
Well, I've already seen Africa.

53
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,873
And it's hot.

54
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:24,653
Excuse me.
Did you say hot?

55
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:31,250
Please send my apologies
to the Serene Highness.

56
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,109
And my name isn't Tarzan.

57
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,615
It's John Clayton the third.

58
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,806
Son of John and Alice Clayton.

59
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,157
Fifth Earl of Greystoke.

60
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,496
A member of the House of Lords.

61
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,878
Mr. Clayton.

62
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,640
Lord Clayton.

63
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:02,513
My apologies. George Washington Williams,
Diplomatic Envoy for the United States.

64
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,938
- I was sent by President Harrison.
- To do what?

65
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:06,517
Join up with the Queen's emissary.

66
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:10,523
You know, America was the first country
to recognize King Leopold's claim on Congo.

67
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:13,151
You don't want to lose
your place at the trough.

68
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:14,654
Look.

69
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,598
I need your invitation
to get in.

70
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:21,057
I'm afraid my intentions aren't exactly

71
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:24,214
what I expressed to your
government on my end.

72
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,524
And what exactly do you want,
Dr. Williams?

73
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:34,556
Leopold has spent the last 7 years
getting control of the Congo.

74
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,231
He used up his entire fortune
building that railroad of his

75
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,374
and shut off access to
99% of the country.

76
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,515
Why?

77
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,631
Because he wants to be the
first monarch in history

78
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:46,150
that doesn't want people
to see his good deeds?

79
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,998
I don't buy it.

80
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,231
Tell me this, Lord Clayton.

81
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:56,247
How does a bankrupt king
keep the whole of the Congo working?

82
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,516
Slavery?

83
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,738
I hope I'm wrong,
but I need to know.

84
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,926
And for the sake of
your friends back home...

85
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,514
You do too.

86
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,197
Accept Leopold's invitation
and take me with you.

87
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,990
You know Africa of
the beaten path.

88
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:20,103
The languages, the people,
the customs.

89
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:22,587
If we find anything amiss,
I need

90
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:26,299
someone to tell the world
that they will believe.

91
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:39,169
I'll make all the arrangements.
I'll see you in Liverpool.

92
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,503
My family.

93
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,470
I've done all I can
to protect them.

94
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:26,887
We have been surrounded by
predators since the shipwreck.

95
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:31,131
The jungle consumes everything.

96
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:35,896
It preys on the old, the sick,
the wounded, the weak.

97
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,330
But never the strong.

98
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:45,019
Today I buried my Alice.

99
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,955
My dear Alice.

100
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,847
Now I fear for my child.

101
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:56,195
God help us.

102
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:58,952
God help him.

103
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,399
The most dangerous beast
in Africa is so powerful,

104
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:21,338
it can snap a crocodile's back
with a single bite.

105
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,495
Anyone?

106
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:28,985
Is it a hippopotamus?

107
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,253
Yes, preciously.
Well done, Mary.

108
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,306
Now.

109
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:40,558
Can anyone tell me what my
favourite bird sounds like?

110
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,819
Anyone?

111
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,935
How did you live
in the jungle?

112
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,405
Look at his hands!

113
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,741
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

114
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,975
I grew up running
on all fours.

115
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:15,534
It changes the bone structure.

116
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,976
Do you swing on things inside?

117
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,310
Like when you go upstairs.

118
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,971
Oh, I never take the stairs.

119
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:29,941
I usually take the curtains.

120
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:34,711
Is it true,
you mom was a monkey?

121
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,970
Of course not.
My mother is Alice Clayton.

122
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:45,675
I can't wait to see Wasimbu again.

123
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,236
- How many children would he have now?
- Jane.

124
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:49,459
We know about Keko.
She's what? Four?

125
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:51,021
- Everyone will have children.
- Jane.

126
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:53,346
I mean, 8 years just
feels like a lifetime.

127
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:54,934
This isn't a holiday.

128
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,153
How many corsets
does a diplomat bring?

129
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,003
I can't take you.

130
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:02,690
- I say zero.
- Four.

131
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:05,004
I suppose a British lady
should faint at least twice

132
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,519
to justify the silly title.

133
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,280
- It isn't safe there.
- Of course it's not safe there, John.

134
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:13,431
You take a nap in the wrong place,
you got a 50-50 chance of being eaten.

135
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,166
Ladies.
Albert.

136
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:26,972
You can't possibly still think
there's a danger, John.

137
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:32,629
You haven't spoken
his name in years.

138
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,399
Talk to me.

139
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:41,281
Mbonga is not my concern.

140
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,011
You are.

141
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:45,550
We lost a baby.

142
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:48,599
The last thing you
need is more stress.

143
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:52,927
Yes.
Well.

144
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:55,966
Thank you for the reminder.

145
00:17:56,817 --> 00:18:00,116
Oh, in case you forgot.
We both grew up there.

146
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,464
So perhaps I will fulfill
your duties for the Queen

147
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:06,346
and you can stay here
hypothesizing coconuts

148
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,288
and playing ping pong.

149
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,152
- I want to go home.
- This is our home.

150
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,816
Trying to keep me
here won't work.

151
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,879
COLONIAL OFFICE
- JOHN CLAYTON -

152
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,556
John, my son.

153
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:48,063
You are the heir to Greystoke,
our future.

154
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,499
England is your home,
not this wretched place.

155
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:56,943
If I don't survive,

156
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,587
I pray that someone will save you.

157
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,580
Promise me you'll stay with
the Kuba the whole time.

158
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:52,902
Not a chance, Jane.

159
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:57,116
Kickback of the Colt 
is very nasty.

160
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:59,699
As a matter of fact,
that's why they went out of style.

161
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:03,725
Pretty little ladies like you kept 
knocking themselves in the face with it.

162
00:24:04,031 --> 00:24:07,829
I bet I can hit that log
over there, first try.

163
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,079
Jane.

164
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,462
He's known them
since they were cubs.

165
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:14,224
BOMA WELCOMES JOHN CLAYTON III

166
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:37,348
Force Publique, move aside.
Force Publique, move aside!

167
00:25:38,194 --> 00:25:39,821
I want port of entry.

168
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:42,837
I want port of disembarkation
for every passenger.

169
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,540
Yes, sir.
These are the last.

170
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,622
- Sir.
- Thank you.

171
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:56,137
[John Clayton]
[George Washington Williams]

172
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,769
Excuse me, sir.
The ledger.

173
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:07,764
Yes, thank you.

174
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:41,220
Mr. Frum.

175
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:45,924
Champagne.
The music.

176
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,968
The entire operation just fell apart.

177
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:51,101
- Have faith, Mr. Frum.
- Faith is for missionaries.

178
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,074
He gave you the slip.

179
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,622
Make sure the rest
goes down below.

180
00:26:57,693 --> 00:27:00,907
Our invitation has been snubbed,
Mr. Frum.

181
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:02,790
They jumped ship
further up the coast

182
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:05,962
and they are on their
own little tour home.

183
00:27:05,987 --> 00:27:09,980
So from Boma up to here
will take me 3 days.

184
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:14,753
I shall deliver Tarzan and return.
A week's delay.

185
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:17,455
You are not in position to ask
for anything, Mr. Rom.

186
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,435
Your king's payment
was due 3 months ago.

187
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,796
Yes.

188
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:32,379
I manipulated my firm
to keep this deal alive.

189
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:35,456
Ah. You agree because you will
get stinking rich so don't get droughty

190
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:39,037
- Now you must but us more time.
- I already bought all the time...

191
00:27:39,198 --> 00:27:40,567
Look, it's really very easy.

192
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,444
You say aloud to the arriving fleet
and tell them payment must be made

193
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:46,371
in Boma for security reasons.

194
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,988
Opa better not be a myth.

195
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:11,123
Bring me the rest
and you'll have your mercenaries.

196
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,698
But, if you fail to
make good this time,

197
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:16,584
my firm will go to the
barter parliament for compensation.

198
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:20,208
Your king will lose this land and
who do you think he will blame?

199
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:22,300
Leon Rom.

200
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,749
Tarzan, you look funny!

201
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,790
Muviro!
Muviro!

202
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:21,407
Jane!
Thank goodness.

203
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:33,680
Keko.
How are you?

204
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:58,604
Wasimbu?
Oh my god.

205
00:30:01,896 --> 00:30:05,104
Jane Porter,
welcome home.

206
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:18,410
As is custom, no one has
entered until you returned.

207
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,624
This is where Jane grew up.

208
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:34,258
Her father taught English
in the village.

209
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:20,093
Well, I'm not going to drink some
foam and a couple of

210
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,587
you know what it is
you won't tell me.

211
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:31,403
That's sweating everybody, huh.
Mm-hm.

212
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:54,711
They are singing
the legend of Tarzan.

213
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,471
For many moons he was
thought to be an evil spirit.

214
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,535
A ghost in the trees.

215
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:15,551
They speak of his power over
the animals of the jungle.

216
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,710
Because his spirit came from them.

217
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,632
He understood them.

218
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,085
And learned to conquer them.

219
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:45,141
His ape mother, Kala,
loved him as her own.

220
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:50,386
And his ape brother, Akut,
treated him with kindness and respect.

221
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:59,118
He considered all men
to be his enemies.

222
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:03,090
Since other tribes would hunt
his troop as a rite of passage.

223
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,792
Chief Muviro knew what he was.

224
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,082
He was good to him.

225
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:22,260
Since no man ever
started with less.

226
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,854
John?

227
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,872
(Bird chirping.)

228
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:00,980
(Bird chirping.)

229
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,749
Blue bottom Rufous Towhee.

230
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,107
Mating call.

231
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,083
Be still my beating heart.

232
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:24,903
Mandrill.

233
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:28,649
Also a mating call.

234
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:41,875
Cheetah.
Mating call.

235
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:54,721
Seven. Six.
Five. Four.

236
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:56,781
Three.

237
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:02,252
Two.

238
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:14,185
I know you took my handkerchief.

239
00:35:15,432 --> 00:35:17,909
We're from America.
My father's a professor.

240
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:21,161
So I didn't grow up
believing in spirits.

241
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,655
Hello.

242
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:34,668
You're welcome to have it.

243
00:35:36,472 --> 00:35:38,831
Will you speak to me?

244
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,250
Um.

245
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,388
You must know that this is
uh, very peculiar.

246
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:17,523
I'm not sure my father would
find this very appropriate.

247
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:20,075
But um.

248
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:25,263
You must make an effort
to embrace customs of...

249
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,560
Oh!
I don't think so, wild man!

250
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:32,439
No, no, no.
Wait!

251
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:00,203
I speak many languages.

252
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:05,281
Kneel!

253
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,431
A Kuba chief, never kneels.

254
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,727
- Down, all of you!
- Get down!

255
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,578
Hold him still!

256
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:59,188
Tighter!
Tighter!

257
00:39:01,303 --> 00:39:05,121
He ain't so tough.
We got a little monkey boy.

258
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:23,730
Some legend, Mr. Rom.
Chief Mbonga will be disappointed.

259
00:39:28,155 --> 00:39:30,404
Wind up 10 of the strongest.

260
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:32,873
- We'll need porters.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:35,045
These go right to you, sir?

262
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:38,807
You're coming, men.
You're coming with me!

263
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,315
John!

264
00:40:01,888 --> 00:40:03,765
- Stop it, woman.
- Get off me. John!

265
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:07,127
Must have been something
the first moment you saw her.

266
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:11,472
After all the Negroes and baboons.

267
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:17,238
John!

268
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:46,567
Quickly!

269
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:50,096
Don't look at me.
Never look at me.

270
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:52,857
- Move, woman!
- Get your hand off me!

271
00:41:07,177 --> 00:41:09,238
Mr. Rom, we'll bring him back.

272
00:41:09,263 --> 00:41:11,501
Go!
Go.

273
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:20,568
Get the Maxim ready!
Hurry!

274
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:31,442
Focus fire on the boilers,
below the chimney.

275
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:36,675
Pull away!

276
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,036
Where do you think you are going?
Stay back!

277
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:54,188
I need you to scream for me.

278
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:57,892
Like a damsel?

279
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,171
No matter.

280
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,679
He's Tarzan,
you're Jane.

281
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,490
He'll come for you.

282
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,272
John!
John!

283
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,275
John!
John!

284
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,217
- They came for me quickly.
- This was not done by you.

285
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,043
You know they were.

286
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:17,372
We've heard of Whites that
come and fight for money.

287
00:43:17,396 --> 00:43:19,214
Do not wear Belgium colors

288
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:21,543
Called Force Publique.

289
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:24,076
The man I interviewed in
Belgium told me about them.

290
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,615
Did anyone mention
a man named Rom?

291
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:30,317
Nobody gave up any names.
But, Leon Rom.

292
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,511
He's king Leopold's envoy to Congo.

293
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:36,403
Any other revelations?

294
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,467
Not from me.

295
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:41,242
Why did you say
they came to get you?

296
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:52,237
The boat is traveling upstream.
It will slow it down.

297
00:43:52,261 --> 00:43:54,503
We should get to
Boma's mountains before them,

298
00:43:54,528 --> 00:43:57,450
if we take this route
through the Mangani lands.

299
00:43:57,475 --> 00:43:58,878
How do you know
where they are going?

300
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,796
This route is longer

301
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:02,913
But it is where they are
building the railroad.

302
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:05,140
We can ride it
part of the way.

303
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,776
Good.

304
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:10,411
John.

305
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:12,556
John.

306
00:44:14,128 --> 00:44:15,463
John.

307
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,115
Fine!
I'm still coming with you.

308
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:20,809
You can't keep up.

309
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:22,873
I might not be able to
keep up with Tarzan

310
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:24,713
but I sure as hell
can keep up with you.

311
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:27,822
It is not wise.
Falling behind means certain death.

312
00:44:27,847 --> 00:44:29,993
I spent over half
my life in the wild.

313
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:32,386
Besides, nobody here is
better than me with a rifle.

314
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,500
That one right there.
He'll still be choked out

315
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:36,844
redder than the cardinal's ass
if it wasn't for me.

316
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,658
And that's the truth...

317
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:40,326
You really think I care
about my life?

318
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,222
Get your mitts off me.

319
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,715
- If you would just...
- If I just what?

320
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,398
Left you in England
in your castle!

321
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:52,102
They have my wife
and their families.

322
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:48,128
Whoever you are,
we're here by royal invitation.

323
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:50,918
As guest of King Leopold.

324
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:55,298
Lady Clayton, I orchestrated the invitation.

325
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,587
You were not included.

326
00:45:58,945 --> 00:46:01,211
Now was Dr. Williams.

327
00:46:03,624 --> 00:46:08,000
A tribe of savages is trying
to tear your husband apart

328
00:46:08,025 --> 00:46:10,791
and maybe butcher him
and eat him.

329
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:13,026
And I'm going to
deliver him to them.

330
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:14,695
And once I'm dispatch with him,

331
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,846
Dr. Williams will not be left
as a witness, that's clear.

332
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,976
Which begs the question.

333
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:25,795
Where does that leave you?

334
00:46:32,481 --> 00:46:35,739
You'll notice none of
the natives are smiling.

335
00:46:42,812 --> 00:46:44,734
That one's your friend?

336
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,926
They all are.

337
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,789
You do know that the right
side of your mustache is just

338
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,055
a little lower than the left.

339
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:47,396
John!
John!

340
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:12,820
Different kind of wilds.

341
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,107
How are we suppose to catch
a train going 40 miles an hour?

342
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,411
Gravity.

343
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:47,498
SHIT!

344
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:50,785
Ahhhhh!

345
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,978
Climb on my back.

346
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,702
Alright, legs too.

347
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:11,273
Don't think for a second
you're saving my life.

348
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:44,545
Give me the keys
to the chains.

349
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:02,569
- Are you the commander?
- Don't tell him anything.

350
00:52:04,197 --> 00:52:08,113
Those are some mighty big
earlobes you got there, son.

351
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:15,796
You think that was
a lucky shot?

352
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,916
I'm just an engineer
for the bridge.

353
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:28,367
And how many men have been
enslaved to build your bridge?

354
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:32,919
800, plus this group of natives.

355
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:36,865
Please, I'm here to build bridges
for Monsieur Rom's army.

356
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,808
I have no part in that.

357
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:40,975
What army?

358
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,302
The railroads, combine
with the navigable rivers,

359
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:55,739
put 60% of Congo
within 3 days of a fort.

360
00:52:57,168 --> 00:53:00,142
Forts are done.
But the army has not come.

361
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:01,575
Where are they?

362
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,329
I don't know.

363
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,517
They were supposed
to be here months ago.

364
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:08,022
But, they said the king
has yet to pay for them.

365
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:09,693
How many are there?

366
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,613
20,000.

367
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,271
And they are not regular soldiers.

368
00:53:17,743 --> 00:53:19,629
They are mercenaries.

369
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:22,251
Long to enjoy
killing for a living.

370
00:53:22,276 --> 00:53:24,499
20,000 men.
50 forts.

371
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:28,911
That's 400 blood thirsty bastards
arm with a Maxim gun

372
00:53:28,936 --> 00:53:31,341
and repeating rifles at each one.

373
00:53:31,366 --> 00:53:35,505
He'll end up enslaving the entire
country to get what he wants.

374
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:37,998
People won't stand a chance.

375
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:40,953
What is Mr. Rom's part in this?

376
00:53:40,978 --> 00:53:42,532
It's his plan.

377
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,978
He's in charge of all of it.

378
00:53:46,908 --> 00:53:49,964
They expected he would be name
Governor-General Rom soon.

379
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,662
No, no, no.
Wait!

380
00:54:05,574 --> 00:54:07,711
Wait, please!

381
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:58,651
Shut it!
Clucker.

382
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:09,397
Now, if you do anything

383
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:11,694
unladylike in there,

384
00:56:12,406 --> 00:56:14,112
He drowns.

385
00:56:33,207 --> 00:56:35,460
Enjoying your peek show?

386
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:41,908
Of course I know you can
see me, Lady Clayton.

387
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:58,134
- Are you a religious man, Mr. Rom?
- Oh. Oh.

388
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:00,764
Madagascar spider silk.

389
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:08,002
My priest purchased it for me
in Jerusalem when I was nine.

390
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:11,135
Sounds like you and
your priest were awfully close.

391
00:57:11,991 --> 00:57:13,421
Why?

392
00:57:20,748 --> 00:57:22,155
I want you to know,

393
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,441
I think your husband had
no right to bring you along.

394
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:28,709
- I brought myself, Mr. Rom.
- Yes, of course.

395
00:57:28,734 --> 00:57:30,995
But he was supposed
to be the only casualty.

396
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,754
Aside from the entire country of
people you're enslaving of course.

397
00:57:36,804 --> 00:57:38,651
Would you pass the pepper?

398
00:58:10,893 --> 00:58:13,785
It can also serve
as a necklace.

399
00:58:25,757 --> 00:58:28,167
On my last visit to Europe,

400
00:58:28,192 --> 00:58:31,371
I attended a few lectures
at the Sorbonne.

401
00:58:31,396 --> 00:58:34,175
The king of France
got a soft clap.

402
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:39,237
Henry Morton Stanley, a bastard
orphaned by birth, got a standing ovation.

403
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,110
You know.

404
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:44,504
People love a good story.

405
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:49,702
Yeah, few are born
blue bloods like your husband.

406
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:55,824
But everyone can relate to
a low born scrapper who

407
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:59,568
rescued his king from bankruptcy
and saved the honor of his nation.

408
00:58:59,593 --> 00:59:02,636
That is a man who will
never be forgotten.

409
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:09,600
My king's army is due in 6 days.

410
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:13,344
All I have left to do is deliver
Tarzan to chief Mbonga.

411
00:59:16,547 --> 00:59:19,097
I doubt you recognize the name.

412
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:24,774
I'm aware of his obsessive
desire to kill your husband

413
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,682
but I have yet to
discover the cause:

414
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:29,495
"What did Tarzan do?"

415
00:59:31,016 --> 00:59:33,423
Killed his only son.

416
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:38,252
- Oh.
- Mm.

417
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:43,692
And get ready because
that is nothing

418
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:46,715
compare to what
he will do to you.

419
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:55,641
Your husband's wildness disturbs me
more than I can easily express.

420
00:59:56,754 --> 00:59:59,261
Whereas your spirit.

421
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:14,925
My knife, please.

422
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,035
Slowly.
Your friend won't float.

423
01:00:30,149 --> 01:00:31,743
Thank you.

424
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:44,193
Lady Clayton's finished.

425
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:50,912
A normal man can do the impossible
to save the woman he loves.

426
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:54,529
My husband is no normal man.

427
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,514
You cannot go alone.

428
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:28,053
They consider a 
seven a raid.

429
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:30,406
None of us will survive.

430
01:01:32,577 --> 01:01:35,810
This says it's against the law
to pay natives to work.

431
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:39,368
This is ledger of all
the slaves taken so far.

432
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,234
Slave labor.
Diamonds everywhere.

433
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:45,432
Rom is going to make his monarch
the richest king in the world.

434
01:01:45,457 --> 01:01:48,011
Dr. Williams, you have your evidence.

435
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,527
I'll take care of Rom.

436
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:58,135
I have no choice.

437
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:00,528
I'll lose 2 days going around.

438
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:03,068
- Go around what?
- Mangani.

439
01:02:03,093 --> 01:02:05,450
Those gorillas you used to live with?

440
01:02:05,725 --> 01:02:07,077
They are not gorillas.

441
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:10,998
Gorillas are gentle.
Mangani are not.

442
01:02:17,788 --> 01:02:19,737
I've never left a friend in trouble.

443
01:02:19,762 --> 01:02:22,983
Or a partner in the lurch.
I'm not about to start now.

444
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,179
Stop calling me Doctor.
My name is George.

445
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:29,659
We'll keep your proof safe, George.

446
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:31,084
I know.

447
01:02:31,523 --> 01:02:33,257
Meet us in Boma.

448
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:37,546
- If we don't make it back.
- We will... with your family.

449
01:02:37,571 --> 01:02:40,130
Get the books to my
grandfather in London.

450
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:44,129
- Still not waiting for you.
- Tell me something I didn't know.

451
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:58,631
What I wouldn't give
for a horse right now.

452
01:02:59,928 --> 01:03:02,464
Why the people don't ride zebras?

453
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:04,862
The horses kick to escape.

454
01:03:04,887 --> 01:03:07,538
Zebras continue until you are dead.

455
01:03:07,731 --> 01:03:09,267
Zeebra. Zehbra.
Tomayto. Tomahto.

456
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:12,141
It's nearly impossible to take the
wild out if something born to it.

457
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,520
That seem to work with you.

458
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:18,886
Look.
I feel foolish for asking, but...

459
01:03:19,027 --> 01:03:21,147
Can you really talk to animals?

460
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:25,568
You're an educated man, Dr. Williams.
You tell me.

461
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:38,466
Hey.
Hey, pretty lady.

462
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:42,854
That's a male.

463
01:03:43,126 --> 01:03:45,476
He's warning us to stay clear.

464
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,754
You're trying to tell me
those things are deadly?

465
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,858
If you get too close
it will knock you to the ground

466
01:03:51,883 --> 01:03:54,910
and disembowel you
with those 3 inch talons.

467
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,960
No ostrich is going to kill me.

468
01:03:58,383 --> 01:04:00,226
You can try and ride him.

469
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:03,132
Ha ha.
You like that, wouldn't you.

470
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:09,606
Oh.

471
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:22,525
Damn.
That is one odious aroma.

472
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,570
- Woo, god.
- Keep your voice low.

473
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,299
That them?

474
01:04:37,528 --> 01:04:39,479
You don't want to do that, George.

475
01:04:39,504 --> 01:04:43,360
Kill one and the rest won't stop
until they torn you to pieces.

476
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:46,764
So how do you
want to play this?

477
01:04:46,977 --> 01:04:50,785
Their leader will come down
and we'll fight.

478
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,007
You're going to fight one of those?

479
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:55,724
Oh I wish.

480
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:57,924
I have to fight Akut.

481
01:04:58,796 --> 01:05:00,796
He's my brother once.

482
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:03,451
And now he will consider
me a deserter.

483
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:07,308
Whatever happens,
do not interfere.

484
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:10,686
- Understand?
- Mm-hm.

485
01:05:15,892 --> 01:05:17,585
Christ almighty.

486
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:22,044
That's Akut?

487
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,730
You sure you don't want
me to shoot him?

488
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,566
Promise me.

489
01:05:42,713 --> 01:05:43,925
.

490
01:06:54,415 --> 01:06:56,367
Get on your knees and bow.

491
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,889
Right now!

492
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,088
Expose your most vulnerable part.

493
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,100
You want me to
lick his nuts too?

494
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,205
If you want to live.

495
01:07:21,935 --> 01:07:25,089
- George.
- I wasn't gonna.

496
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,756
Oh, you looked like you would.

497
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:49,015
- Is he coming back?
- No.

498
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,432
It's quite decisive.

499
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:54,493
This bite is infected, you're
going to have problems.

500
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,814
And there's this.

501
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:03,203
Now you know,
I was not going to lick his...

502
01:08:03,228 --> 01:08:05,891
- You looked like you are.
- Well, I wasn't.

503
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:13,981
You aren't going anywhere 
until we get this stitch up.

504
01:08:19,076 --> 01:08:20,806
Are you eating them?

505
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:23,784
- Taste like bacon.
- Eww.

506
01:08:23,798 --> 01:08:26,269
You get us a nice fat snake,
I grow up on that.

507
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:29,590
Snake's a good meat.
I ain't eating no damn ant.

508
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:31,853
Well, suit yourself.

509
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:34,193
And when you are finished,

510
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:37,467
chew the flowers until poultice and 
wipe it on the cut with a rub.

511
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,229
That will hold.

512
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:46,538
Are you aware that you always seem you're 
going to do something right before you do it?

513
01:08:46,563 --> 01:08:48,639
Yeah?
Well.

514
01:08:48,664 --> 01:08:51,457
That's only since I've been
saddled with your company.

515
01:08:54,205 --> 01:08:55,536
How is it?

516
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:57,348
It's manageable.

517
01:08:57,853 --> 01:08:59,358
Pain.

518
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:03,857
I get too much 
experience with it.

519
01:09:11,187 --> 01:09:13,925
The Civil War was dark fighting.

520
01:09:15,145 --> 01:09:17,538
But I was proud 
to be part of it.

521
01:09:19,373 --> 01:09:21,147
It changed me though.

522
01:09:22,133 --> 01:09:26,454
Afterward, I was a walking
talking powder keg.

523
01:09:28,737 --> 01:09:32,352
Joined up to fight 
Maximilian down in Mexico.

524
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:37,801
Then, worked as an Indian fighter.

525
01:09:38,686 --> 01:09:40,989
Did both those for the money.

526
01:09:43,421 --> 01:09:45,433
I was young.

527
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:47,982
That's no excuse.

528
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:54,994
Mexico was bad.

529
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:59,229
But what we did 
to the Indians...

530
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,549
I'm not better than those Belgians.

531
01:10:40,223 --> 01:10:42,147
My old friend.

532
01:10:58,181 --> 01:11:01,872
The Tekes say an elephant's eyes
speak the greatest language.

533
01:11:04,832 --> 01:11:08,113
What else can make you feel 
so much without a word?

534
01:12:27,919 --> 01:12:32,184
Is Mr. Rom ready for some
more scintillating conversation?

535
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:36,140
He was the only reason you
weren't serviced.

536
01:12:36,141 --> 01:12:37,709
Serviced?

537
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:40,614
Is that what your 
mother would call it?

538
01:12:46,721 --> 01:12:48,660
Shut your mouth!

539
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:04,961
Stop the boat!
Stop the boat!

540
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:07,190
Turn it around!

541
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,584
Stop shooting!
You'll hit the girl!

542
01:13:43,275 --> 01:13:45,247
That woman.

543
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:17,222
Wait!

544
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:20,901
They'll follow my tracks!
Go get help!

545
01:14:20,926 --> 01:14:22,235
Go!

546
01:15:53,413 --> 01:15:56,103
Promise you won't hurt them?

547
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,441
No! 
Stop!

548
01:16:31,905 --> 01:16:34,380
Please, stop!

549
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,759
John!

550
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:46,977
Stop! 
Stop it!

551
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:56,362
Stop it! 
Please!

552
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:01,032
Please! 
Please!

553
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:03,667
- Come on.
- Move out!

554
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:56,909
What was that?

555
01:18:57,629 --> 01:18:59,106
Tarzan.

556
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:02,367
Although it sounded 
different than I thought.

557
01:19:03,092 --> 01:19:04,435
Better.

558
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:20,424
Schmidt-Rubin.

559
01:19:25,947 --> 01:19:27,744
John!

560
01:19:29,405 --> 01:19:31,067
John!

561
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:32,670
Stop!

562
01:21:55,854 --> 01:21:57,472
John!

563
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:08,212
Now you feel my pain!

564
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:16,634
I'm not your enemy.

565
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,278
Rom is buying an army
with your jewels.

566
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:21,172
- They cannot touch us!
- You know nothing!

567
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:24,937
Your lands are full of diamonds!
He'll come back for them.

568
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:57,400
Your chief is under my knife!

569
01:23:57,425 --> 01:23:59,731
You are under my knife!

570
01:24:00,898 --> 01:24:02,381
Finish it.

571
01:24:02,774 --> 01:24:04,080
Finish it.

572
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:05,659
STOP!

573
01:24:12,538 --> 01:24:15,573
Your son killed the only person 
who ever cared about me.

574
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:16,952
It was an animal.

575
01:24:16,977 --> 01:24:20,151
She was my mother.

576
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:24,846
How was he to know?

577
01:24:26,223 --> 01:24:29,330
My son was just a boy!

578
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:31,626
Not like you!

579
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,717
Where was your honor?

580
01:24:39,895 --> 01:24:41,122
I...

581
01:24:48,703 --> 01:24:50,366
I had none.

582
01:24:52,632 --> 01:24:54,183
I had none.

583
01:25:33,377 --> 01:25:36,320
Can we please just stop this?

584
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:40,046
We won't get all of you, 
or you us.

585
01:25:40,071 --> 01:25:41,915
But Rom will.

586
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:43,957
He'll wipe you out.

587
01:25:44,155 --> 01:25:48,327
Every last one of you.
Like you never even existed.

588
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,516
You think that's impossible?

589
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,418
You are looking at a man
that had seen it happened.

590
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,287
Rom's got the diamonds.
There's a thousand men down there.

591
01:27:32,312 --> 01:27:35,647
And 20,000 more on the way.
We're screwed.

592
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:38,727
- Where are you going?
- To get some friends.

593
01:27:57,489 --> 01:28:01,767
Landing station!
Prepare to land!

594
01:28:56,235 --> 01:28:59,492
It doesn't matter.
He's too late.

595
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,611
Run! Run!

596
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:13,365
Fall back!

597
01:29:39,151 --> 01:29:40,584
Bring her!

598
01:30:09,626 --> 01:30:11,578
Grab the diamonds!

599
01:30:11,994 --> 01:30:13,392
Run!

600
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:17,000
John! 
No!

601
01:30:17,383 --> 01:30:18,776
John!

602
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:22,414
John!

603
01:30:46,927 --> 01:30:49,865
Get to the boat!
Go!

604
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,303
We're coming! 
Hold on!

605
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:51,041
John?

606
01:32:02,286 --> 01:32:04,068
That's the payment.

607
01:32:06,178 --> 01:32:08,809
Lower the skiff and don't dally.

608
01:32:15,055 --> 01:32:16,526
Did you see him?

609
01:32:16,551 --> 01:32:18,172
Is he down there?

610
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:28,482
1886 model Maxim machine gun.

611
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:33,546
This is way better than
my Walker Colts.

612
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:56,500
Mr. Rom!

613
01:33:58,597 --> 01:34:03,246
Mr. Frum, you portly coward!
Come and get your diamonds!

614
01:34:09,472 --> 01:34:12,015
Farewell, sweet lord.

615
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:16,309
Take Tarzan with you.

616
01:34:17,779 --> 01:34:20,163
The future belongs to me.

617
01:34:42,725 --> 01:34:44,243
What was that?

618
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,398
Mating Call.

619
01:35:35,557 --> 01:35:37,148
Tarzan!

620
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:38,979
Tarzan!

621
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,588
John!

622
01:35:42,705 --> 01:35:43,948
John...

623
01:37:02,722 --> 01:37:05,305
We are not going to go 
into that mess for free.

624
01:37:07,903 --> 01:37:09,727
Raise the anchor.

625
01:37:53,235 --> 01:37:55,873
Ain't this a hell of a day?

626
01:38:05,859 --> 01:38:08,111
Nice outfit there, Jane.

627
01:38:10,783 --> 01:38:13,572
You look like you're 
about to give me a hug.

628
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:15,998
I wasn't.

629
01:38:17,006 --> 01:38:18,808
Look like you were.

630
01:38:44,805 --> 01:38:49,042
An open letter to His 
Serene Majesty, Leopold the 2nd,

631
01:38:49,067 --> 01:38:51,662
King of the Belgians.

632
01:38:51,948 --> 01:38:56,223
Every charge I'm about to bring against 
your Majesty's personal government of Congo

633
01:38:56,248 --> 01:38:58,720
has been carefully investigated.

634
01:38:58,745 --> 01:39:03,801
We have witnesses, documents,
letters and official records

635
01:39:03,826 --> 01:39:05,678
to bring to your attention.

636
01:39:05,703 --> 01:39:10,393
And to verify our claims
of your systematic abuse

637
01:39:10,418 --> 01:39:13,799
and enslavement of the Congolese people.

638
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:20,808
George Washington Williams.
July 18, 1890

639
01:40:31,783 --> 01:40:34,528
They are singing
the legend of Tarzan.

640
01:40:41,861 --> 01:40:45,418
For many moons he was
thought to be an evil spirit.

641
01:40:46,856 --> 01:40:49,130
A ghost in the trees.

642
01:40:55,107 --> 01:40:58,990
They speak of his power over
the animals of the jungle.

643
01:41:00,646 --> 01:41:03,291
Because his spirit came from them.

644
01:41:06,214 --> 01:41:08,332
He understood them.

645
01:41:16,201 --> 01:41:19,168
And learned to be 
as one with them.

646
