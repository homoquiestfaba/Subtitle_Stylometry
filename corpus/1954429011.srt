1
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:34,929
Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes

2
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:16,709
Caesar

3
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,714
They're close

4
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,302
koba

5
00:02:27,873 --> 00:02:28,948
Everybody! Take your positions

6
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,434
Now, Father?

7
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,919
son, stay.

8
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,018
stay back

9
00:05:07,257 --> 00:05:10,183
Thank You, Koba.

10
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:29,989
my son

11
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,065
Think before you act, son.

12
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,906
Done feel bad, Blue Eyes...

13
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,895
scars make you strong.

14
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,127
come meet your new brother.

15
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:24,751
another son?

16
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:33,973
makes me think how far we've come

17
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:36,702
seems long ago.

18
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:46,596
still think of them?

19
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,318
humans?

20
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,089
sometimes.

21
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,440
Didn't know them like you did.

22
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:01,706
Only saw their bad side.

23
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,790
Good, Bad... doesn't matter now.

24
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:12,301
Humans destroyed each other

25
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,409
apes fight too..

26
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:16,749
but we are family

27
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:28,087
wonder if they are really all gone.

28
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,523
Ten winters now...

29
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:34,240
Last two... no sign of them.

30
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,189
They must be gone.

31
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:12,178
That bear wouldn't get me blue eyes. I'm quick!

32
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,151
Shut up, Ash!

33
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,439
they shot Ash! Shot my son!

34
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,420
Rocket, Wait..

35
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:26,045
koba

36
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,226
follow them

37
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:55,368
Must attack them now!

38
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:57,968
Before they attack us!

39
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,378
We dont know how many there are.

40
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,209
How many Guns they have?

41
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,941
Or why they came up here?

42
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:14,108
They shot your son, Rocket!

43
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:19,530
Dont you want to fight?

44
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,568
I follow Caesar.

45
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:25,381
Koba's right!

46
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,498
They almost killed you, Ash.

47
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:43,477
If we go to war...

48
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:47,109
We could lose all we've built

49
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:51,351
Home!

50
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,708
Family!

51
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:04,969
Future!

52
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,192
I will decide by morning.

53
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:30,193
Caesar

54
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,039
For years I wan prisoner in their lab...

55
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,322
They cut me

56
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:40,534
tortured me

57
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,099
you freed me.

58
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,963
I would do anything you asked.

59
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,651
But we must show strength!

60
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,938
We will, Koba!

61
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:39,655
If they get power, they'll be more dangerous!

62
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:40,937
Why help them?

63
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:43,083
They seem desperate...

64
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,888
If we make them go, they will attack.

65
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:49,759
LET THEM!

66
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:52,298
we'll destroy them while they are weak.

67
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,989
And how many apes will die?

68
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:01,472
we have one chance for peace..

69
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:06,006
Let them do their human work, then they'll go

70
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,330
Human Work?

71
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,141
Human work.

72
00:38:18,323 --> 00:38:20,257
Human work.

73
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,676
Human! work!

74
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:04,698
Koba says, Apes should hate humans..

75
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,105
Enough!

76
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:09,474
From Humans, Koba learned hate...

77
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,739
But nothing else..

78
00:41:57,805 --> 00:42:01,497
You sound sick... You ok?

79
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,837
Just need rest..

80
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:15,651
You worry about humans...

81
00:43:16,873 --> 00:43:17,872
Where's Koba?

82
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:22,059
Still angry.

83
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:27,851
said he was going hunting...

84
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:36,227
Look! Humans below...

85
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:50,948
Why are we here?

86
00:43:52,587 --> 00:43:54,186
Caesar, trusts humans...

87
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:56,550
Koba, does not..

88
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:19,331
Enough guns here to kill every Ape...

89
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:21,374
Must warn Caesar.

90
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,100
Who knows what humans are really doing up there?

91
00:54:36,488 --> 00:54:37,487
Father, No..!

92
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,047
I will not help!

93
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:46,285
Just came from city.. Humans very dangerous!

94
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:48,283
Where's Caesar?

95
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,746
with the Humans...:(

96
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,711
You are my son...

97
00:59:42,254 --> 00:59:43,853
I need you to listen...

98
00:59:55,919 --> 01:00:00,228
You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?

99
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:06,175
Neither will you...

100
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:20,455
Your father doesn't trust me now

101
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:25,349
You need to protect him.

102
01:00:27,747 --> 01:00:29,013
His love for humans

103
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,665
makes him blind.

104
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,508
I know.

105
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:37,485
As long as they are here

106
01:00:38,882 --> 01:00:42,404
I fear for Caesar's life

107
01:08:50,179 --> 01:08:51,244
Feeling better?

108
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:41,409
Human Gun!

109
01:11:23,556 --> 01:11:27,225
Go! Get them!

110
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,441
Females and young stay in the woods...

111
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:46,707
We go to the city!

112
01:11:54,027 --> 01:11:56,359
We Will Avenge Your Father's Death.

113
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:33,063
Humans Escaping! Capture them!

114
01:24:35,302 --> 01:24:39,286
Followed the Humans here! They are escaping everywhere

115
01:24:39,918 --> 01:24:41,517
We must catch them all!

116
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,626
Go ahead Ash...

117
01:25:11,282 --> 01:25:12,614
...make Humans pay.

118
01:25:17,732 --> 01:25:19,465
Caesay wouldn't want this.

119
01:28:32,946 --> 01:28:34,766
Maurice...?

120
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:37,569
Koba said...

121
01:28:38,386 --> 01:28:41,532
.. we're too loyal to your father.

122
01:28:43,335 --> 01:28:47,815
Protect yourself!

123
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:19,487
for now.

124
01:34:28,972 --> 01:34:29,971
I'm so sorry.

125
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:34,505
For everything

126
01:34:45,857 --> 01:34:48,396
But KOBA betrayed you.

127
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:27,649
on the Human Tower

128
01:35:30,657 --> 01:35:32,122
Loyal Apes around him.

129
01:35:36,907 --> 01:35:37,906
Prisoners

130
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,879
Maurice

131
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:43,268
Rocket

132
01:35:49,033 --> 01:35:50,032
Koba killed Ash

133
01:35:56,728 --> 01:35:58,260
Fear makes other follow

134
01:36:01,127 --> 01:36:03,623
But when they see you alive

135
01:36:04,883 --> 01:36:07,660
They will turn from Koba

136
01:42:07,019 --> 01:42:10,250
Koba sent for females and young

137
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,514
They are on their way

138
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,198
Mother too
