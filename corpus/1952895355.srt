1
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:25,046
Man, let me tell you something.

2
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:30,277
In South Africa in 1983...

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,381
there was three things you
definitely didn't want to be-

4
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:36,289
young...

5
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,317
black...

6
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,521
and radical.

7
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:52,103
We say there will be
no education without liberation!

8
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:54,610
Stand up now with dignity!

9
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:56,703
March forward!

10
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,805
We are raising
our clenched fists!

11
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:01,715
Mayibuye! Afrika!

12
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,048
Away with the government!

13
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:05,111
Away with the regime!

14
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:07,953
We say,
"Away with Bantu education!"

15
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,482
We say, "Away with exploitation
and unemployment!"

16
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,995
We say,
"Away with matchbox houses!"

17
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,690
- Amandla!
- Away!

18
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:16,096
- Amandla!
- Away!

19
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,693
- Amandla!
- Away!

20
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:23,297
All I want is the names.
That's all I want.

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,537
You're a young little boy.

22
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:30,478
How old? How old?

23
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:32,538
Thirteen?

24
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:35,107
Fourteen?

25
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:39,986
You should be out on the street
kicking a ball around...

26
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:42,514
playing soccer.

27
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:46,794
Not this!

28
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:52,800
Now listen to me,
you little kaffir.

29
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:59,205
Next time, next time...

30
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:01,176
I'll pull the trigger.

31
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,941
There was never a next time.

32
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,917
I was smuggled
out of the country...

33
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:10,613
before my next birthday...

34
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:12,451
and ended up living
in the Bay Area...

35
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,617
San Francisco,
but that's another story.

36
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,093
It was fourteen years
before I set foot...

37
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,562
in the land of my birth again.

38
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:23,088
I came back to bury my father...

39
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:25,601
in the beautiful hills
of the Transkei.

40
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:29,571
The thing is,
I left as an African...

41
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,471
and came back an American.

42
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,866
Ernie!

43
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,895
How you doing?

44
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,930
Oh, man.

45
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,737
How you doing?

46
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,573
Look at you.

47
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,944
Damn, man. You was this big
last time I seen you.

48
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,912
What's up?

49
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:58,011
Never mind. Come.
We have to get you changed.

50
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:00,352
No. This is what I'm wearing.

51
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,483
- What?
- This is it.

52
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
OK. Come.

53
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:06,787
I like the little hook-up, man.

54
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,299
That's where we buried Father.

55
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,098
He died asking for you.

56
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:19,635
Come.

57
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,984
Here. Take this.

58
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:30,781
What?

59
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,014
Take it.

60
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,421
I can't do that.

61
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,925
You have to.

62
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,428
You're firstborn.
Now take it.

63
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,235
Give me that.

64
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:06,906
I bet you don't get
that kind of beer...

65
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,145
where you come from.

66
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,984
I come from here.

67
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,820
I mean America.

68
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:19,559
No, thank you.

69
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,723
Don't tell me
you're a vegetarian now.

70
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:34,604
He's studying to be a doctor
of literature, old man...

71
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:38,080
African literature.

72
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:40,742
He's a big shot,
but in the meantime...

73
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:43,581
he's trying to keep
lowlife kids out of trouble.

74
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,247
Isn't that so, Vusi?

75
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:49,590
I don't deal
with lowlifes, Ernest.

76
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,561
I deal with young kids that
got problems like me and you.

77
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:57,699
Every month he's been
sending us dollars.

78
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,964
He's rich.

79
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:02,938
Gets his money from trying
to help American children...

80
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:05,463
with their drug problems...

81
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,976
but then his conscience
tells him...

82
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:11,242
he must study African literature
so he can keep in touch...

83
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,441
with our beautiful,
rich culture...

84
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,384
something he knows
nothing about anymore.

85
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,387
Ain't nothing changed.

86
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:22,551
You still as full of shit
as you was when I left.

87
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,992
How many times did I tell you
to come to America...

88
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:27,155
take advantage,
get an education?

89
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:29,187
There are more important
things to do-

90
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:31,564
the struggle.

91
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,592
But then you wouldn't know
anything about that...

92
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,604
living in
your cozy democracy...

93
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:36,969
twenty thousand miles away.

94
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:42,839
Boy, I was in the struggle...

95
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,847
when you were still
pissing in your pants.

96
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,441
Bullshit!

97
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,610
You were a little kid
when you left.

98
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,416
Those were games
we were playing.

99
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:53,820
I mean, look at you.

100
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,222
He even sounds
like a fucking American.

101
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,318
"Oh, I was in the struggle. "

102
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,921
What bullshit!

103
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:04,797
Look. I'm here. I'm back home...

104
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,995
and we really don't even need
to argue about this.

105
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:08,435
Well, you can't.

106
00:09:08,471 --> 00:09:10,234
You're the one who went away...

107
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,434
away from all the fighting
and the struggling.

108
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:15,706
Look, they was gonna kill me!

109
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:18,305
Not you, me!

110
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:21,180
So don't tell me about
running away from the struggle.

111
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,068
The days of beating
are over, old man.

112
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:26,772
You know, I didn't see Steven
around the fire.

113
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,408
Where is he?

114
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:32,080
We haven't heard from him
for a long time.

115
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,214
Is he all right?

116
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,425
We hear from other people...

117
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,587
that he has a job
in Johannesburg.

118
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,029
I'm worried about him.

119
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:45,397
My heart tells me
something is wrong.

120
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,528
You must go and find him
and bring him home.

121
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,767
I wish I could.

122
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:55,539
I got a flight that leaves
tomorrow morning...

123
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:58,775
and exams and...

124
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:01,579
There's no way
I could stay here in Africa.

125
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,642
I gotta go back home.

126
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:08,123
Vusi, son, you are the head
of the household now.

127
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:11,388
Steven is my last born.

128
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,520
You have to go and find him.

129
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:15,087
You have to.

130
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,021
I'm about to get out of here.

131
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,896
I just came to say bye.

132
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:27,562
Why did you
have to hire a BMW?

133
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:30,697
Why not a Toyota or something?

134
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,537
What's wrong with a BMW?

135
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:35,442
I hate them.
They're for the rich...

136
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:37,378
the exploiters.

137
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:39,040
Is there anything
you don't hate?

138
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,981
I don't hate fighting the Boer.

139
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,951
I don't hate my AK-47.

140
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:46,648
I don't hate grenades,
my limpet mines.

141
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,021
Why do you keep all that shit?
For what?

142
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:52,050
Because if the new
South Africa treat the poor...

143
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,154
like the old South Africa,
then they will need them.

144
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,558
Maybe you need to go back
to be a soldier, man.

145
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:00,762
What for?

146
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:03,599
There's peace.

147
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,336
Everybody's talking about peace,
but where's justice?

148
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,435
Where's my justice?

149
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:10,945
You'll come back.

150
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,143
Affirmative action will give
you a nice car, a nice job.

151
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,242
What about me?

152
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:20,016
An old M.K. soldier.
Nobody needs me.

153
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:24,356
What you need to do
is get yourself back in school.

154
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,623
See, that's how you fight
a war-with education.

155
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:28,027
Just fuck off!

156
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:29,861
Wait a minute.
Let me tell you something.

157
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,560
You're my brother,
and I love you...

158
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,060
and you can cuss me all day,
but never put your hands on me.

159
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:44,068
Tell Mother I'll send word
as soon as I find Steven.

160
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,920
I bet you won't even look!

161
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:55,321
You'll run away
like the coward that you are.

162
00:13:55,358 --> 00:13:57,690
Well, I'm the one
that's going to look for him.

163
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:00,059
You the one that let him go.

164
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,868
I couldn't blame Ernest.

165
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,370
He was a soldier without a war.

166
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:13,535
Victory had come so sudden,
he didn't know what to do.

167
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:17,342
He was lost, but so was
my little brother Steven...

168
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,111
and I had to find him...
somewhere in Johannesburg.

169
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,981
Guess what they tried
to get me to do.

170
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,988
- What?
- Sacrifice a bull.

171
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:29,150
- You mean kill it?
- Yeah.

172
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:30,488
Did you do it?

173
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,551
No. Ernest did. My brother.

174
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:34,961
Did it suffer?

175
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:37,192
No. It was real quick,
like sudden death.

176
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:39,633
- Real quick.
- Yuck.

177
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,637
What you mean, yuck?
That's the ritual here.

178
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:46,129
- It's the tradition.
- I don't care.

179
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:48,666
What I need you to do
is call the professor...

180
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,010
and tell him my mother's
sick or something.

181
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:53,538
What's wrong with her?

182
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,049
She ain't sick...

183
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:58,076
but he's not gonna understand
the reason I have to stay.

184
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,111
You can't afford
to miss your exams.

185
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,556
I know, but I'm the eldest.

186
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,525
How are you gonna find him?

187
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,926
I don't even have
any phone numbers on him.

188
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:09,624
All I got is two addresses-

189
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,963
one in the city
and one in Soweto.

190
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,992
What are you gonna do?

191
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:17,005
I'm gonna try the one
in the city tonight.

192
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,008
I should be on the plane
first thing in the morning.

193
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,532
All right. Be careful.

194
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:24,910
- OK. All right?
- OK.

195
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:28,348
- I'll call and let you know.
- All right. Bye.

196
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:32,543
Shit.

197
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,870
It's Vusi, man!

198
00:15:57,947 --> 00:16:00,814
Shut up already.
I'm trying to sleep.

199
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,340
He's not there, OK?

200
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:04,750
If he was,
he'd answer the fucking door.

201
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,278
Do you know him?

202
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,622
Sort of. I see him around.

203
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,217
When was the last time
you seen him?

204
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,252
Who are you, a cop?

205
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,923
No. I'm his brother.

206
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,900
Oh, my God. You must be
the one from America.

207
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:21,061
You know where I can find him?

208
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:24,038
No. I haven't seen him
for a couple of days now.

209
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,772
Do me a favor.

210
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:32,110
When you see him...

211
00:16:32,148 --> 00:16:35,083
give me a call.

212
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:39,110
I'm at the Garden Court,
room seven-twenty-five.

213
00:16:40,823 --> 00:16:43,587
Why should I?

214
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:46,322
Now, come on.
Nothing's for free.

215
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:49,593
I'm not giving you nothing.

216
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,965
If he calls...

217
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:55,095
tell him to get in contact
with his family.

218
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:57,196
Something's happened.

219
00:17:00,276 --> 00:17:02,403
OK. If I see him, I'll call.

220
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,239
Thank you.

221
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,745
My name's Vusi.

222
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:14,119
I know. I'm Karen.

223
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:37,878
- What do you want?
- Is Steven here?

224
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:43,514
Could you tell me
the last time you seen him?

225
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,521
I know no one
by the name of Steven.

226
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:49,088
Shit.

227
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,867
- Get out.
- What?

228
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,170
Come on. Out!

229
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:15,974
Give me your money,
or I'll fucking kill you.

230
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,747
Oh, man. Come on.

231
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,981
On your knees... boy.

232
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:28,990
Your money.

233
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:30,965
Nice jacket.

234
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,434
Where'd you get it?

235
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:38,233
San Francisco.

236
00:18:41,176 --> 00:18:42,370
Cool!

237
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:45,107
I love it, and I want it.

238
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,978
Now, take it off.

239
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:03,829
I'll have the shirt, huh?

240
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,636
Why y'all doing me like this?

241
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:21,115
I thought we was brothers.

242
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,640
Brothers?

243
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,984
You're not my fucking brother.

244
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,318
You got that?

245
00:19:32,428 --> 00:19:34,589
Come on.
Let's kill this bastard.

246
00:19:36,765 --> 00:19:38,926
Come on, guys. Let's go.

247
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,102
Wait!

248
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,266
Can I at least have the spear
on the dashboard?

249
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,409
What is this?
A curio to take home?

250
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,043
It's my father's.

251
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,457
You want it?

252
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,456
Sure, you can have it.

253
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,767
See you, brother.

254
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:24,871
Man, living in exile's
not an easy thing.

255
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:27,006
You dream of coming home.

256
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,916
Every single night,
you dream of coming home...

257
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,715
but I got to tell you...

258
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:34,188
I never dreamt of this.

259
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,824
Room seven-twenty-five.

260
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,995
And your name is, sir?

261
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:50,470
Madlazi. V. Vusi.

262
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:54,306
Address-four-seventy-five
Jefferson Drive...

263
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,937
Bay Area,
San Francisco, California.

264
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,504
Now, can I have my goddamn key?

265
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,016
There's no need to be rude.

266
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:10,387
Sorry. I had a bad day.

267
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:13,759
Is there anything else
I can do for you, sir?

268
00:21:13,796 --> 00:21:15,525
No. That's it.

269
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:24,361
You wouldn't happen to have
any Scotch tape back there?

270
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:25,930
Sticky tape?

271
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:32,006
Thank you.

272
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:38,943
Baby, look, do not worry.
I'm fine.

273
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:40,648
What do you mean, don't worry?

274
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:42,657
All they did was took the car.

275
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,057
At least you're OK.
Did they take anything else?

276
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,061
They took my fucking shirt.

277
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:50,553
- Your shirt?
- Yeah. I can't believe it.

278
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:53,363
I come all the way out here
to get carjacked.

279
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:54,892
Sounds like here.

280
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,963
I could have kept my ass
at home to get carjacked.

281
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:00,338
This isn't funny.

282
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,400
I know it ain't funny, but...

283
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,207
Sounds serious.

284
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:07,010
I don't know about
this new South Africa.

285
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,679
I'll definitely be on the first
flight tomorrow morning.

286
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,689
- L.A.X.?
- No. The one out of Miami.

287
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:17,586
Hold on. Somebody's at my door.

288
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:25,827
Come on in.

289
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,034
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. I'll call you tomorrow.

290
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,974
- What time?
- I'll let you know. Bye.

291
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:38,069
What have we got here?

292
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:43,642
The Summit Club.

293
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,978
Where's the Summit Club?

294
00:22:47,022 --> 00:22:48,956
It's in Hillbrow.

295
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:52,154
You want a woman.

296
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:53,627
No. I'm all right.

297
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,501
Summit Club?

298
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,470
Go on! Get 'em off!

299
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:17,217
Take it off!
Go on, get it off!

300
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:34,926
Got your note.

301
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,201
Cool. Do you want a drink?

302
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,639
Yeah. Let me get a beer.

303
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:41,609
Get us a beer and a vodka.

304
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,377
You're a stripper.

305
00:23:46,915 --> 00:23:48,075
I do whatever.

306
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:55,854
When I was here last,
you'd never have...

307
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,325
black people and white people
in the same club.

308
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,828
It was all, you know, separated.

309
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,989
Well, this is
the new South Africa.

310
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:09,829
Anyway, last night
around two in the morning...

311
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,635
I'm awake, and I start hearing
these sounds...

312
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:14,733
coming from Steven's place.

313
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:16,437
First I think it's him...

314
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:18,673
but then I hear things
being broken-crashing...

315
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:21,274
and I just know I'm not
going near his front door.

316
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,553
So what you saying?

317
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:27,020
Well, just that.

318
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,488
I don't know
if he was there...

319
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:30,889
but whoever was there
was fucking heavy.

320
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:32,985
They were pissed off.
Trashing the place.

321
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:36,255
You call the cops?

322
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:38,528
Come on. Do I look dumb?

323
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:43,036
Anyway, I thought
I should let you know...

324
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,561
'cause this afternoon
when I got up-

325
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:46,164
I sleep late-

326
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:48,608
I knocked on his door.
Nothing.

327
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:51,636
Wait a minute.
What the hell's going on?

328
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,205
You're his brother.
You tell me.

329
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:57,480
Karen, you're up next.
You go whack 'em, huh?

330
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,646
- OK, I'm coming.
- So soon?

331
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:04,317
Isn't she the cutest, huh?
Look at those tits.

332
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,452
I'll be there now, Herb, OK?

333
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,593
Would you mind waiting for me
in the pool hall?

334
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,500
No, I don't mind.

335
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:17,630
Thanks. It's just over there...

336
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:20,233
and don't let those hookers
talk you into anything.

337
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:30,340
Hi, baby.

338
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:33,744
Come. Let's go upstairs.

339
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,154
For what?

340
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,350
You know.

341
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,757
No, I don't.

342
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:41,160
OK. Buy me a drink,
and I'll show you.

343
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:42,959
Buy me a drink.

344
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:45,125
You buy me a drink.

345
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,692
Look, you're wasting your time.

346
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:52,070
There's two things
I never, ever buy...

347
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:55,133
water... and pussy.

348
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,111
Why's that?

349
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,774
Because they both come free.

350
00:26:00,816 --> 00:26:02,545
Go ahead.

351
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:23,095
You're the one I love, babe.

352
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:42,052
I thought I told you
not to watch.

353
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,251
- I wasn't watching you.
- You were.

354
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,418
No, I wasn't.

355
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,360
I was trying to get the hell
out of there.

356
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:48,919
Don't flatter yourself.

357
00:27:01,843 --> 00:27:04,403
Why did you start
stripping, anyway?

358
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:07,643
For the money.
And I like dancing.

359
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,815
That's not dancing.

360
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:18,519
That's shaking your ass
on-stage for money.

361
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,927
Well, maybe I'll become
a ballerina one day.

362
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:25,628
Yeah, maybe, huh?

363
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,537
I'm going to try again.

364
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,065
He's not there.

365
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:40,207
Come on. I can get in
through the window.

366
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:41,545
Window?

367
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,483
Come on.

368
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:46,316
Excuse the mess.

369
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:49,721
There's some vodka in
the kitchen if you want some.

370
00:27:49,758 --> 00:27:52,090
I'm cool.

371
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,757
What the hell you doing?

372
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,926
The window's open. Look.

373
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:02,334
You're about to climb
out on the outside?

374
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,701
Hey, it's easy.
I've done it before.

375
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:06,104
Go around to the front door.
I'll let you in, OK?

376
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:16,780
Crazy.

377
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:56,414
Open the door.

378
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:00,054
Get off!

379
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:12,969
Fuck you!

380
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:14,305
You dick!

381
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,905
Who the hell was that?

382
00:29:20,949 --> 00:29:23,179
I'll tell you in a minute.

383
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:36,363
I hate them!

384
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:38,195
Fucking hell.
They know he's a DJ.

385
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,895
They know he loves his records
more than anything.

386
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:42,403
Fuck them!

387
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,405
Who?

388
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:47,670
Who the hell was that
in the hallway?

389
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:52,237
The cocaine boys.
The West Africans.

390
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,078
Cocaine boys?

391
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:57,983
Wait a minute.

392
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,384
What's going on?

393
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:04,551
Steven had a deal
with a guy called Muki.

394
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:06,856
What kind of deal?

395
00:30:06,895 --> 00:30:08,920
He got coke on credit
and was selling it.

396
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:11,660
He wanted to make a quick buck.

397
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:19,006
Listen,
he wanted to go to California.

398
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,066
We were gonna come find you.

399
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,578
Who is "we"?

400
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:26,443
Him and me.

401
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:30,451
It figures.

402
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:31,952
I'm sorry.

403
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:33,818
Where is he?

404
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:35,186
I don't know.

405
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:41,594
Where is he?

406
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,290
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

407
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,026
You think I'm playing with you?

408
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:47,193
Do you think
I'm playing with you?

409
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:48,930
You are taking me
to my brother right now!

410
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,905
Get the fuck off!
I don't know where he is!

411
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,498
Yes, you do!

412
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:58,778
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,474
I shouldn't have pushed you.

414
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:04,318
It's just this whole trip.

415
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:07,913
It's just stressing me
the fuck out.

416
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:10,424
That's OK.

417
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,925
Why don't you come next door?
I'm gonna go change.

418
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,825
Then we're gonna go
look for him.

419
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:15,227
Where?

420
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:17,128
The clubs.

421
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,797
I didn't know you was
a fucking crackhead.

422
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,302
That's my business.

423
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:37,201
You got my brother hooked
on that shit, didn't you?

424
00:33:37,238 --> 00:33:39,433
The last time I looked,
your brother was a grown man...

425
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:42,102
and a grown man doesn't get
hooked if he doesn't want to.

426
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,873
Wait! Let me tell you something.

427
00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,643
Until we find Steven,
your business is my business.

428
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,809
Get the fuck in the car.

429
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:52,012
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Get your ass in the car!

430
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:57,013
Not so fast.

431
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:58,889
What you doing with this kaffir?

432
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:00,326
You can fuck off, too.

433
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:03,558
- Kaffir fucker.
- Fuck you.

434
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:05,862
- What are you saying, bitch?
- Hold up.

435
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,664
We had a fucked-up day.
Come on. Let's go.

436
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:11,968
Give me one excuse!
Just one.

437
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:16,443
You stay there
like a good little boy.

438
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:17,967
You hear me?

439
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:22,305
Maybe we should fuck her.

440
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,341
How many times
have I told you...

441
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:27,582
we never fuck chicks
who fuck kaffirs, hey?

442
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:29,385
How many times?

443
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:32,621
Three, four times?
I don't know how many!

444
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:35,623
What you smiling at?

445
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:38,826
You. Some things
never change, do they?

446
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:45,366
I swear to God,
I'll blow you away!

447
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:48,341
I want him to watch this.

448
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:54,604
It's people like you that are
fucking this country up!

449
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:05,890
Thank you.

450
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:12,325
Please, man, don't shoot.

451
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,267
I ain't gonna shoot.

452
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:16,429
Guns are for cowards,
not warriors.

453
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:17,597
Come on. Let's go.

454
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,005
Hold on.

455
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:23,943
I've been waiting
for this moment all my life.

456
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,651
Come on, man. Just me and you.

457
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:34,086
My pleasure.

458
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:46,356
I thought you said
you was a warrior.

459
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:50,360
Yeah, I'm a warrior,
but I ain't no goddamn fool.

460
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,199
Come on. Let's go.

461
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:16,895
Can you do me a big favor?

462
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,800
Yeah. What is it?

463
00:36:22,837 --> 00:36:24,828
I want you to go
to a friend of mine.

464
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:28,535
Tell him I sent you.
He's at the Ambassador Hotel.

465
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:32,012
That's just here in Hillbrow
on Pretoria Street.

466
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:35,379
Tell him you want one
and give him this.

467
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:41,679
One what?

468
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,748
One gram.

469
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,421
Hell, no. Hello, no.

470
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:52,331
Come on. It's not such
a huge thing to ask.

471
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,561
Please?

472
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,929
Girl, you don't need no cocaine.

473
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:59,496
What you need is somebody
to check those ribs for you.

474
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,371
Come on.
There's nothing wrong.

475
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,343
I wouldn't be able to breathe
if there was.

476
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:04,743
Please?

477
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,770
- No.
- Please?

478
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:07,872
No.

479
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:14,984
If you can't help me,
I can't help you find Steven.

480
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:19,521
That's that.

481
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:42,244
What the hell was I doing...

482
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:45,480
scoring crack
for some crazy white girl?

483
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,080
I wasn't any closer
to finding Steven.

484
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:52,058
I should have just turned around
and got the hell out of there.

485
00:37:54,762 --> 00:37:58,823
One-sixty. She want one.

486
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:01,835
Sit down.
On the bed is fine.

487
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,599
Now, I don't know you.

488
00:38:07,642 --> 00:38:09,906
I don't know you from anywhere.

489
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:14,748
Where do you know Karen from?

490
00:38:14,782 --> 00:38:17,410
I just know her, you know.

491
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:19,079
But you're not local.

492
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,954
You talk with a funny accent.
Where you from?

493
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,823
What difference do it make
where I'm from?

494
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,487
You got the cocaine or what?

495
00:38:27,528 --> 00:38:31,191
Hey, I had an informant
come in here the other day.

496
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,859
Just like you.

497
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,063
Yeah.
He brought the cops with him.

498
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:40,931
They searched this place
inside and out.

499
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,443
They found nothing.

500
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:45,639
That's a very nice story.
I'll remember that.

501
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,648
But I'm in a hurry,
so I don't mean nothing-

502
00:38:47,682 --> 00:38:49,843
Did you see Karen now?

503
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:52,318
No. I'm just taking it
back to her.

504
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:56,346
Was she with
that Steven bastard?

505
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:02,229
Hey, I'm asking you a question.

506
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,097
No, she wasn't with Steven.

507
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:08,897
He's running shit scared,
that one...

508
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:12,269
and he's got Muki's money
with him, you know?

509
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,797
Muki says I mustn't
even sell to Karen...

510
00:39:14,842 --> 00:39:16,207
because he thinks
that Karen and Steven...

511
00:39:16,244 --> 00:39:18,303
are in it together, you know?

512
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:20,473
He's cross with her, too.

513
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:23,040
Look, you got my money.

514
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,551
I'm just trying
to get out of here.

515
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:26,712
No. If Muki hears
I've sold to Karen...

516
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:28,915
he's going to cut me off
one time.

517
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:31,925
Who's going to tell him?
I'm not.

518
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:34,621
Yeah, but because of
this terrible inconvenience...

519
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:36,323
the price is going up.

520
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:37,956
How much?

521
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,526
Say... fifty bucks?

522
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:44,703
Fifty bucks.

523
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,735
What a gyp.

524
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:53,770
Hey, I've got three rooms
in this place.

525
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:55,577
I might not be
in the plush towers...

526
00:39:55,616 --> 00:39:56,776
with Muki and the boys...

527
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:58,978
but I've got this place
sorted out.

528
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,954
Nobody fucks with me.

529
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,456
That's very nice.

530
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:05,152
You wait here.

531
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:19,262
Hey, Sam! It's me, man.

532
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:25,003
Open the door!

533
00:40:25,046 --> 00:40:27,310
Hey, come on!

534
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:34,621
Sam ain't here.
He'll be back in a minute.

535
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:35,815
Wrong door.

536
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:45,823
Hold up! Wait! Wait!

537
00:41:02,116 --> 00:41:03,276
It's Vusi!

538
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:13,151
Wait a minute.
What the fuck is going on?

539
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:16,061
I find my brother,
and he runs away from me?

540
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:19,897
Someone has some serious
explaining to do.

541
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:24,427
What's going on, eh?

542
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,096
Where have you been?

543
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:28,938
Relax. I can explain.

544
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:32,707
Relax, nothing, boet.
Inside. Come.

545
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:36,984
I told you to wait here, huh?

546
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:39,179
I think you must
just go stand by the window.

547
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,020
I can just poke you and
throw you out into the street.

548
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:45,218
Go on.

549
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:48,786
I think you need to stand
by the fucking window.

550
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:52,963
That's a nice gun.

551
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,264
Yeah. Come on.

552
00:41:55,302 --> 00:41:57,736
No problem. I'm going.

553
00:41:57,772 --> 00:42:00,935
Where can I find Steven?

554
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,409
Why?

555
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:05,241
'Cause he's my brother,
motherfucker.

556
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:07,338
Hey, I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

557
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:09,542
He hasn't come around for ages.

558
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:13,144
Bullshit! I just seen him
at the door five minutes ago.

559
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:16,281
But if he's your brother,
then why would he run away?

560
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:18,951
Shut up!
I ask the goddamn questions.

561
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:20,119
Where can I find Muki?

562
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,994
No. You don't understand.

563
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,329
You don't find Muki.
Muki finds you.

564
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:30,661
Don't you got something for me?

565
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:32,263
Well, give it here.

566
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:34,001
I will. You know what?

567
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,168
Just to show you
what a big heart I've got...

568
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:38,678
I'm going to give you
the money, too.

569
00:42:38,713 --> 00:42:41,978
You tell Karen
that this one is on me.

570
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:49,113
Clean up your goddamn room.

571
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:57,430
Did you get it?

572
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,599
Thanks.

573
00:43:08,943 --> 00:43:12,606
Well, I see you got
what you wanted.

574
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:15,809
I'm out of here, because
I definitely got what I wanted.

575
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:19,183
Come again?

576
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:22,883
I saw Steven.

577
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:24,515
Where?

578
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:26,583
At the asshole you sent me to.

579
00:43:26,627 --> 00:43:28,390
Is he OK?

580
00:43:28,429 --> 00:43:32,229
No. He didn't look right.

581
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,359
Where is he?

582
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:36,892
I don't know. He ran from me.

583
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:39,701
He's been paranoid.
This does that to you.

584
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,038
What you saying?

585
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:44,738
He's a fucking crackhead
like you?

586
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:47,009
Here's to the rush.

587
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:00,656
You didn't tell Sam
you're his brother?

588
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:05,723
You didn't.

589
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:08,257
I did.

590
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,632
Did you hear that?

591
00:44:17,545 --> 00:44:19,035
Check outside.

592
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,239
For what?

593
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,977
'Cause now they're gonna
come looking for him.

594
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:25,042
Have a look and do it casual.

595
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:26,677
Goddamn.

596
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:34,719
Nothing.

597
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:39,999
That was dumb,
telling him you're his brother.

598
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:41,558
Dumb, dumb, dumb!

599
00:44:41,602 --> 00:44:43,593
Wait a minute.
That wasn't too dumb.

600
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:46,265
You're just paranoid, remember?

601
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:48,468
Listen, man, I know this place.
You know nothing.

602
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:50,704
I know Muki. Come.
We've gotta get out of here.

603
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:52,006
Wait a minute. Relax!

604
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:53,877
Don't tell me to relax!

605
00:44:53,914 --> 00:44:56,883
Those people will kill us
just to give Steven a message.

606
00:44:56,917 --> 00:44:58,885
You still got the gun?

607
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,409
Keep your hands on it. Let's go.

608
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,684
Hey, man, where you going?

609
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:05,692
- To your hotel.
- Hell, no!

610
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:08,559
Listen, man,
they're gonna kill us. Come!

611
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:10,257
Goddamn!

612
00:45:35,322 --> 00:45:37,017
Can I get a drink?

613
00:45:37,057 --> 00:45:40,026
Do what you like.
I got to make a phone call...

614
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,789
so could you
kind of keep it down?

615
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:43,194
Sure.

616
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,398
Sorry.

617
00:46:03,017 --> 00:46:04,951
How you doing? It's me.

618
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:09,845
You know that morning flight
I was trying to get?

619
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,482
Don't tell me.

620
00:46:11,525 --> 00:46:13,186
That ain't gonna happen.

621
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:16,196
They got an afternoon flight
leaving via London...

622
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,722
and if I got to hijack it,
I'm gonna be on that one.

623
00:46:19,767 --> 00:46:21,166
Did you find your brother?

624
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:24,534
Yeah, but I didn't have
a chance to talk to him.

625
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:27,233
Great.

626
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:30,266
What are you going to do?
What about your exam?

627
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:32,370
I'm definitely gonna
make the exam.

628
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,005
No doubt.

629
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:37,213
Sorry! Sorry.

630
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:38,878
What was that?

631
00:46:38,919 --> 00:46:41,217
No. That was me.

632
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:43,086
Yeah, right, that was you.

633
00:46:43,123 --> 00:46:45,648
No, I swear. That was me.

634
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:46,990
I dropped something.

635
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:48,722
What did you drop?
It sounded like somebody-

636
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:50,787
Nobody.
I'm here by myself, I swear.

637
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:52,628
Yeah, I'll bet.

638
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,896
I'm about to go to sleep...

639
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:56,994
so I'll call you
when I get to London.

640
00:46:57,037 --> 00:46:59,198
You do that. I love you.

641
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:00,604
I love you, too.

642
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:01,835
- Bye.
- Bye.

643
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:06,407
Do you usually
lie to your wife?

644
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:10,247
She's not my wife-not yet.

645
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:12,343
Is she black or white?

646
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:14,752
Very funny.

647
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,949
I'm about to go wash up.

648
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,754
I guess I should be
a gentleman...

649
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:21,124
offer you the bed or the couch.

650
00:47:21,161 --> 00:47:23,459
I'm too wired to sleep.
You take the bed.

651
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:25,328
Good.

652
00:47:25,366 --> 00:47:28,335
That stuff's gonna kill you.

653
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:30,098
Who cares?

654
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,137
You should.

655
00:47:43,484 --> 00:47:45,008
OK. If you pull up just here.

656
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:53,255
If you see
that brother of mine...

657
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:56,091
tell him to do the right thing
and write his mother.

658
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,928
I will.

659
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:02,493
I can tell you're his brother.
I like you.

660
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:07,195
Take care of yourself.
Stop smoking that shit.

661
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:09,937
Have a safe trip.

662
00:48:09,977 --> 00:48:12,207
Hold on.

663
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:14,305
I got something for you.

664
00:48:14,348 --> 00:48:17,317
You might need this,
Miss Paranoid.

665
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:18,978
Thanks.

666
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:25,382
Now you're being paranoid.
I was just saying good-bye.

667
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:29,587
Good-bye.

668
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:45,334
We were hoping your brother
would be with you.

669
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:49,372
I'm so sick of motherfuckers
putting guns in my face!

670
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,678
What did you call me?

671
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:24,041
Don't even try it!

672
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:25,745
Stupid fucker.

673
00:49:25,786 --> 00:49:28,380
Put him in the boot.
Come on. Move.

674
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:29,411
Move!

675
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,394
Hell, no.
I ain't getting in there.

676
00:49:39,633 --> 00:49:41,965
You want to bet?

677
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:45,134
Get in.

678
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,099
You like soccer?

679
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:22,769
Not exactly.

680
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:27,971
I bring you
all the way out here...

681
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:30,950
and you tell me
you don't like soccer.

682
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:34,010
It's the most popular
game in the world...

683
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:36,352
except in, maybe, America.

684
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,053
But what do they know, anyway?

685
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:42,584
Yeah, well...

686
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:45,598
I'm kind of into
American football myself.

687
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:48,465
They wear helmets and paddings.

688
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:51,835
That's not a man's game.

689
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:55,273
Look at these South Africans.

690
00:50:55,309 --> 00:51:00,645
They are still too inexperienced
on the international scene.

691
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:05,550
They're vulnerable,
open to attack.

692
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:10,556
So I guess you just
come right on in...

693
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:12,422
and take advantage of that, huh?

694
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:16,657
Of course.

695
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:20,827
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

696
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:26,936
Don't you think South Africa
went through enough shit...

697
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:30,967
without you coming in
and fucking it up even more?

698
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,986
I like to fuck shit up.

699
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,525
It's something in me.

700
00:51:50,697 --> 00:51:54,064
Do you know how much it would
cost me to have you killed?

701
00:52:00,774 --> 00:52:04,232
Four hundred rand.

702
00:52:04,278 --> 00:52:08,339
Tomorrow, someone from
a squatter camp comes along...

703
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:13,183
and shoots you dead
with an AK-47.

704
00:52:17,157 --> 00:52:18,886
For forty-five thousand rand...

705
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:22,725
I can have your
whole family murdered-

706
00:52:22,763 --> 00:52:29,191
uncles, aunties,
cousins, your mother.

707
00:52:29,236 --> 00:52:32,672
That is how much
your brother owes me-

708
00:52:32,706 --> 00:52:35,231
forty-five thousand rand.

709
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:39,678
But then I hear about you,
and I start to think...

710
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:43,046
that maybe there's a way
out of this mess.

711
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,607
You're American, right?

712
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:48,784
Not exactly.

713
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:51,950
But you are from America.

714
00:52:51,992 --> 00:52:54,222
With the rate of exchange...

715
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:58,493
that would be
fifteen thousand dollars.

716
00:52:58,532 --> 00:53:01,160
That doesn't sound too bad.

717
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:05,160
It's not a lot of money
for an American, right?

718
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:08,265
How am I supposed to get
my hands on that kind of money?

719
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:12,574
God.

720
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:16,382
Fifteen thousand dollars.

721
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:17,940
Exactly.

722
00:53:22,956 --> 00:53:26,983
I can't get my hands
on that kind of money.

723
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:30,519
Either you come up
with the money...

724
00:53:30,564 --> 00:53:34,261
or you bury your brother.

725
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:35,893
It's up to you.

726
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:43,969
You can contact me through Sam.

727
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,001
You have two days.

728
00:53:54,888 --> 00:53:56,549
It's me.

729
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:57,716
Jesus. What happened?

730
00:53:57,758 --> 00:54:00,522
Those were Muki's men,
weren't they?

731
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,051
You OK?

732
00:54:03,096 --> 00:54:05,257
I got to raise
fifteen thousand dollars...

733
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:07,425
or they said
they was gonna kill him.

734
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:09,935
Kill him?

735
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,929
Fifteen thousand dollars?
That's a fuckload of money.

736
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:16,772
I know.

737
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,870
Look, I know where he is.
He called me.

738
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:22,541
- Where?
- He's in Sun City.

739
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:25,016
I think he's gambling
to make the money back.

740
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:27,076
How far is that from here?

741
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,554
It's about an hour,
hour and a half.

742
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:32,422
Shit. I'm gonna miss my plane.

743
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:33,687
We gonna go there?

744
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,490
What do you mean, "we"?

745
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:37,690
Don't try that on me again.

746
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:40,029
He might be your brother,
but he's my boyfriend.

747
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:41,328
If you go, I go.

748
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,767
Come inside whilst I get ready.

749
00:54:55,315 --> 00:54:56,942
Oh, shit. Look!

750
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:58,678
Fuck.

751
00:55:00,053 --> 00:55:01,714
What the hell you doing?

752
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:03,222
Look, just pretend
you're my driver.

753
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:05,724
Shit. Girl, get your ass
back in the front.

754
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:07,249
This ain't no
"Driving Miss Daisy. "

755
00:55:07,294 --> 00:55:10,889
- It's the A.W.B., man.
- Who?

756
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:13,559
A.W.B.- a local version
of the Nazi party.

757
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:30,180
Give me the gun.

758
00:55:31,718 --> 00:55:34,949
Damn. Give me the gun.

759
00:55:34,988 --> 00:55:37,388
Gimme the gun and get back
in the front seat.

760
00:55:53,406 --> 00:55:56,967
What's going on?
What's going on here?

761
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,637
Nothing. We're just
on our way to Sun City.

762
00:55:58,678 --> 00:56:00,236
Yeah?

763
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,579
And what you making
with this kaffir, eh?

764
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:07,644
No. He's from America.
I'm showing him around.

765
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:10,656
No. Hold on.
Kaffir? What's that?

766
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,987
You.

767
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:14,016
Yeah, but what does it mean?

768
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,292
Is it like warrior,
king, god, chief? What?

769
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:22,358
It means you must
watch your mouth, boy.

770
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,460
I got your boy right here.

771
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:28,338
He's from overseas.
He doesn't understand.

772
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:32,904
Can we just go now, please?

773
00:56:34,714 --> 00:56:35,976
Yeah, all right.

774
00:56:36,016 --> 00:56:37,745
Go on. Get out of here!

775
00:56:37,784 --> 00:56:38,978
See ya.

776
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:40,316
Asshole.

777
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:42,378
Did you just say something?

778
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:57,235
Hold up.

779
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,737
I think it would be easier
if you looked that way...

780
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:00,535
and I'll look back this way.

781
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:02,064
We'll meet in the bar
in about thirty minutes.

782
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:03,132
OK.

783
00:57:03,176 --> 00:57:06,339
I need a drink,
and I don't have any money.

784
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:09,738
I'm not going to buy any crack.

785
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:11,683
Here it's all just
lines in the toilet...

786
00:57:11,718 --> 00:57:13,686
and Valiums and shit.

787
00:57:19,192 --> 00:57:21,524
- Thank you.
- Thirty minutes.

788
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:39,310
Hey, babe.

789
00:57:39,346 --> 00:57:40,677
What's up with you?

790
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:43,683
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

791
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:46,345
How could you fuck with Muki?

792
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:48,354
Forty-five grand.

793
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:50,913
Forty-five fucking grand!
Are you stupid?

794
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:55,326
How much is left?

795
00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:56,920
About two grand.

796
00:57:56,963 --> 00:57:58,794
Maybe less.

797
00:57:58,832 --> 00:58:01,824
I missed the jackpot
by one seven, babe.

798
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:03,301
Fuck you.

799
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:06,629
I missed you, babe.

800
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:08,300
Fuck off.

801
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,399
What?

802
00:58:09,442 --> 00:58:11,307
You're strung out, babe.

803
00:58:12,345 --> 00:58:13,676
Do you want...

804
00:58:13,713 --> 00:58:15,908
Have you got any stuff?

805
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,746
What did you say?

806
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:20,150
You know. Have you got-

807
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:21,380
I haven't seen you
for two weeks...

808
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:23,753
and the first thing
you ask for is fucking coke!

809
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:24,848
Fuck you, man.

810
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:28,292
I was just trying to help, OK?

811
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:30,262
Your father's dead, Steven.

812
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:32,889
What?

813
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:35,059
That's why your brother's here.

814
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,966
- Yeah, in Sun City.
- Shit.

815
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:39,699
No. You're lucky.
He's gonna pay Muki the money...

816
00:58:39,739 --> 00:58:41,798
so you don't end up
with a bullet in your head.

817
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:51,178
And... my father's dead?

818
00:58:55,722 --> 00:58:58,885
I'm sorry.

819
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:00,688
I'm so sorry.

820
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:06,527
Where's boet Vus?

821
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:07,931
Come.

822
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,294
Come.

823
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:19,037
Look,
I've got about five grams...

824
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,842
of the stash left, you know.

825
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,611
You fuck. You ask me if
I've got any while you've got?

826
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:27,346
Where is it?

827
00:59:27,387 --> 00:59:29,719
If you follow me, you'll know.

828
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,504
How much you putting in now?

829
00:59:55,815 --> 00:59:58,750
Just over half a gram.

830
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:00,650
That's too much, Steven.

831
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:02,848
You're pushing it.

832
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:06,689
Maybe that's the point, babe.

833
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:39,116
Do you have a Steven Madlazi
checked in?

834
01:00:40,794 --> 01:00:44,525
- Yes. Room four-oh-seven.
- Thank you.

835
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:57,709
What the fuck is y'all doing?

836
01:00:57,744 --> 01:01:01,180
Hey, boet Vus.
What's the matter, man?

837
01:01:01,214 --> 01:01:03,444
What's this bullshit?

838
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:04,643
Take it easy, man.

839
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:07,585
You pathetic, man.
I thought you was a man.

840
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,247
I am a man.

841
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:11,780
If you hit him again,
I'm gonna hit you!

842
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:14,350
Get out of the way before
I break your little ass in two.

843
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:16,021
This is family business.

844
01:01:16,062 --> 01:01:19,361
I'm a part of this family.

845
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:21,526
You've got a lot
of catching up to do, Vusi.

846
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:26,003
Give me this shit!

847
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:28,371
Thought you was
going to help me.

848
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:32,172
Look like
you're helping yourself.

849
01:01:35,782 --> 01:01:37,340
I'm sorry.

850
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:42,049
Could you at least
pack his bags, please?

851
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,767
Look at you, man.

852
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:58,303
Our father's dead, Steven.

853
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:01,307
I know, man.

854
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:04,602
Get up, man.

855
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:06,236
I'm taking you home
to your mother.

856
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:07,303
Get up.

857
01:02:07,347 --> 01:02:08,712
Hey.

858
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:12,377
I don't think Ernest
would be cool with that.

859
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:14,283
I'm not going back, man.

860
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,344
Listen!

861
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:17,720
I'm fucking up my life for this.

862
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,884
I'm not going back.

863
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:21,826
I don't want to hear that!

864
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:24,830
Don't tell me what you can
and what you can't do.

865
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:29,268
How could you, Steven?

866
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:32,100
You know how many people died
and suffered in the struggle...

867
01:02:32,138 --> 01:02:35,130
so you can become
the future of South Africa?

868
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:37,404
You can't fall
in the same trap...

869
01:02:37,443 --> 01:02:40,742
as the black Americans
did in the Seventies.

870
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,272
They got free,
and then they got high.

871
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:47,548
Look at me.

872
01:02:47,587 --> 01:02:49,714
Don't fall asleep.

873
01:02:49,756 --> 01:02:53,351
The struggle's never over.

874
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:55,623
Never.

875
01:02:55,662 --> 01:02:58,597
Come on, man.
Get yourself together.

876
01:02:58,631 --> 01:03:00,758
Get your stuff, and let's go.

877
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:19,851
I'm sorry.

878
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:23,253
Sorry?
Is that all you can say?

879
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:25,257
Sorry, sorry, sorry?

880
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:27,191
You sound like a broke record.

881
01:03:27,226 --> 01:03:28,818
Forgive me, then?

882
01:03:28,861 --> 01:03:31,625
Don't get smart.

883
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:33,757
It's a long walk from Sun City.

884
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,504
Come on.

885
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:47,706
What?
I'm staying here with Karen.

886
01:03:47,747 --> 01:03:49,408
Oh, no, no, no.

887
01:03:49,449 --> 01:03:51,440
You ain't running
from me again.

888
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:53,748
Where would I run to, man?

889
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:55,447
I won't, OK?

890
01:03:55,488 --> 01:03:58,286
You ever ride in
the back of a trunk before?

891
01:03:58,324 --> 01:04:01,384
- Boet Vus-
- I'll look after him.

892
01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:02,951
Both of y'all could fit.

893
01:04:08,334 --> 01:04:11,633
- I like your brother.
- Yeah, right.

894
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:16,775
What's so funny?

895
01:04:17,777 --> 01:04:20,678
I was just thinking, you know.

896
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:24,308
We could just take
the money and split.

897
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,942
Go to Egypt or something.

898
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:27,247
Hey, you're crazy.

899
01:04:28,521 --> 01:04:30,614
You know, Karen...

900
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:36,651
you've stuck by me
through so much shit, man-

901
01:04:36,696 --> 01:04:39,358
Hey, I'm your friend.

902
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:41,390
I know.

903
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:45,203
Just want to say thanks, yeah?

904
01:04:51,277 --> 01:04:53,302
Cut that shit out!

905
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,282
Did you get it?

906
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,652
I was only able to get
fourteen-one.

907
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:05,281
But that's
nine hundred dollars short.

908
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:06,655
Hey, that's it.

909
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:09,456
How do you get
to the Towers Hotel?

910
01:05:09,495 --> 01:05:11,656
Turn left at the robot.

911
01:05:11,697 --> 01:05:13,562
At the what?

912
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,191
The traffic light.

913
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:17,168
Turn at the robot.

914
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:30,112
Man, Steven was in
over his head...

915
01:05:30,149 --> 01:05:32,242
but so was the country.

916
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:35,220
Drugs had taken over
where apartheid left off.

917
01:05:35,254 --> 01:05:37,848
It wasn't right.
It was no different...

918
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,358
than what was happening
in America...

919
01:05:40,393 --> 01:05:42,793
and I had to see
what I could do to stop it.

920
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:45,457
When we get in there,
let me do the talking.

921
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:01,178
And where have you been?

922
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:02,943
Sun City.

923
01:06:02,982 --> 01:06:04,711
You never learn, do you?

924
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:12,614
Nothing, man. Nothing.

925
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:25,295
And what the fuck is this for?

926
01:06:25,338 --> 01:06:28,136
I'm not from around here
so I'm kind of nervous.

927
01:06:28,174 --> 01:06:31,302
Yeah. You should be.

928
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:36,843
Come on.

929
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:12,439
You see what I am saying
about the English?

930
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:14,544
They play fast and hard.

931
01:07:14,587 --> 01:07:16,953
They wear their opponents down.

932
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:19,981
That is why they are the
bully-boys of European soccer.

933
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,626
I found this on the brother.

934
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:43,446
So...

935
01:07:45,218 --> 01:07:46,651
Give this to him.

936
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:15,173
American Express.
I like very much.

937
01:08:15,214 --> 01:08:18,308
Yeah. There's a slight
problem with that.

938
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,978
Problem?

939
01:08:20,019 --> 01:08:23,045
Yeah. It's about
nine hundred dollars short...

940
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:27,185
but I can get my hands on that
a little later this week.

941
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,225
Why did you break
all my records, man?

942
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:34,426
Shut up, Steven.

943
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:39,904
You should give me 2,000 rand
of that as compensation!

944
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:41,099
Shut up, Steven!

945
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:44,598
You shouldn't be worried
about your records.

946
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:49,440
You have no need for them.

947
01:08:49,482 --> 01:08:51,848
That was my life, man!

948
01:09:10,403 --> 01:09:12,394
Welcome home, Steven.

949
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:18,300
Don't. Don't do it.

950
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,804
You got your money.

951
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:33,386
You should be more worried
about what you have done to me.

952
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:40,797
The word is out on the street
that people can fuck with me.

953
01:09:42,835 --> 01:09:46,828
Now I can't make deals because
people are starting to think...

954
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:50,330
that they can just run away
with my money.

955
01:09:50,376 --> 01:09:54,335
Everybody in town
wants credit now.

956
01:09:56,415 --> 01:10:00,181
They all think that they can do
like Steven did.

957
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,388
So now I have to give them
a message.

958
01:10:06,992 --> 01:10:10,985
A very clear message.

959
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:19,432
Steven! Motherfucker!

960
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,705
He's bleeding on my floor.

961
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:25,108
Let me go!

962
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:26,839
Get rid of this shit.

963
01:10:28,814 --> 01:10:31,339
You want me to kill
these other two?

964
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:35,047
No. I want
the word on the street...

965
01:10:35,087 --> 01:10:36,952
what has happened
to this bastard.

966
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:39,514
Jesus Christ.
He pays you back the debt...

967
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:41,389
and you still kill him.
For fuck's sake!

968
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:43,657
Shut up, Detective Sergeant.

969
01:10:43,696 --> 01:10:45,755
I'm finished with you
today as well.

970
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:48,961
You're dead! You're dead!

971
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:11,908
What happened?

972
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:14,442
He was murdered.

973
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:18,350
Who did this?

974
01:12:19,892 --> 01:12:22,224
Who the fuck did this?

975
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:25,425
We'll get to that.

976
01:12:30,236 --> 01:12:33,296
No, Mama!
Get her out of here!

977
01:12:33,339 --> 01:12:36,308
Ernest!
Mama, you can't see this!

978
01:12:36,342 --> 01:12:37,809
Go! Go!

979
01:13:01,934 --> 01:13:03,868
This?

980
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:08,636
Thank you.

981
01:13:19,418 --> 01:13:21,978
You know this peace
we talked about earlier?

982
01:13:23,222 --> 01:13:25,986
The peace you said
you hated so much?

983
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:31,585
I didn't see no peace out there.

984
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:34,599
It was war.

985
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:38,330
It's a war out there
on our youth...

986
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:43,273
in this... new country of ours.

987
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:47,245
It's African exploiting African.

988
01:13:49,815 --> 01:13:54,650
We've been oppressed
by the white man so long...

989
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:58,316
all we know is oppression.

990
01:13:58,357 --> 01:14:01,622
Doesn't even matter
who oppresses us.

991
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:04,322
We just accept it.

992
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:07,696
This Muki...

993
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:10,964
This fellow African
that killed our brother...

994
01:14:11,003 --> 01:14:12,800
know what he said to me?

995
01:14:12,838 --> 01:14:16,569
South Africans
were inexperienced...

996
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:19,669
vulnerable, open to attack.

997
01:14:19,712 --> 01:14:23,307
Why didn't you report it
to the police?

998
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:26,284
There was a cop sitting there
when he got shot.

999
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:31,788
So, what you going to do?

1000
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:37,218
I'm going to bury Steven...

1001
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:39,560
I'm going to Jo-burg...

1002
01:14:39,598 --> 01:14:41,725
and I'm killing
that motherfucker.

1003
01:14:43,335 --> 01:14:45,166
I'm coming with you.

1004
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:47,832
We're gonna need guns.

1005
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:49,864
What do you know about guns?

1006
01:14:53,712 --> 01:14:55,703
I'm your older brother...

1007
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:58,182
the head of the Madlazi family.

1008
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:00,208
Don't ever doubt me again.

1009
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:07,584
That sounds like the young Vusi
I used to know.

1010
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:08,820
That's right.

1011
01:15:29,815 --> 01:15:33,512
First my father,
and now my little brother.

1012
01:15:33,552 --> 01:15:36,282
When the time came
to sacrifice the goat...

1013
01:15:36,321 --> 01:15:38,846
I didn't hesitate.

1014
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:41,587
Somehow I knew a lot more
blood would be spilled...

1015
01:15:41,627 --> 01:15:43,618
before this whole thing
was over.

1016
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:49,198
This is my brother Ernest.

1017
01:15:49,234 --> 01:15:50,758
Sit in the back, now.

1018
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:52,065
Yes, sir.

1019
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:25,298
- Here. Stop right here.
- Here?

1020
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:27,464
Yes, stop. Come. Follow me.

1021
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:32,700
Kind of dark out here.

1022
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:40,585
I ain't going to step
in no cheetah shit, am I?

1023
01:16:40,619 --> 01:16:42,712
There's no cheetahs here, man.

1024
01:16:42,755 --> 01:16:44,950
You're so American.
African-American.

1025
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:52,630
Here. Right here.

1026
01:16:52,664 --> 01:16:54,655
Here?

1027
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,861
Yeah, OK.

1028
01:16:56,902 --> 01:16:58,199
You want to start?

1029
01:17:05,544 --> 01:17:07,569
Can I have some help?

1030
01:17:11,216 --> 01:17:13,377
- Come on, boys.
- Shut up.

1031
01:17:13,418 --> 01:17:14,783
Sure there ain't
no dead bodies in here?

1032
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,789
- Yeah. Muki's.
- I wish.

1033
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:21,988
Damn!

1034
01:17:22,027 --> 01:17:23,654
Wow! How long have they
been here?

1035
01:17:23,695 --> 01:17:25,720
Long enough to win a war.

1036
01:17:25,764 --> 01:17:27,664
I thought all arms caches
were turned over to the police.

1037
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:29,394
Yeah, right.

1038
01:17:29,434 --> 01:17:31,868
Wow. Let me see.

1039
01:17:31,904 --> 01:17:33,235
Careful with that thing.

1040
01:17:33,272 --> 01:17:34,967
Jeez, do they still work?

1041
01:17:38,076 --> 01:17:40,601
- Cool! What a rush.
- Give me that!

1042
01:17:40,646 --> 01:17:43,206
- Let's get another.
- Watch out! No!

1043
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:45,978
Just stay on the light!
Crazy ass!

1044
01:17:46,018 --> 01:17:48,043
Careful where you point
that thing next time.

1045
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:50,054
Let's get the hell out of here.

1046
01:18:08,674 --> 01:18:10,266
Hey, open up!

1047
01:18:10,309 --> 01:18:12,038
It's me-Karen.

1048
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:13,510
Who?

1049
01:18:13,545 --> 01:18:14,807
Karen! Open up!

1050
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:17,611
Yeah, OK, I'm coming.
I'm coming!

1051
01:18:21,987 --> 01:18:23,716
I thought you were dead.

1052
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:29,689
What you doing here
so early in the morning?

1053
01:18:29,728 --> 01:18:30,854
Why? You sleepy?

1054
01:18:30,896 --> 01:18:34,059
Yeah, I'm tired. Yes.

1055
01:18:34,099 --> 01:18:35,691
I've got something
to wake you up.

1056
01:18:41,006 --> 01:18:42,371
Hi, Sam.

1057
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:56,421
Hey, how you doing?

1058
01:18:56,455 --> 01:18:58,150
Go away.

1059
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:07,292
I see you didn't clean up
your room like I asked you.

1060
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:09,266
I've been busy.

1061
01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:13,860
Look, all you got to do...

1062
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:17,637
come with us,
pretend we're your friends.

1063
01:19:18,644 --> 01:19:20,475
Just give a present to Muki.

1064
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:23,777
You can go fuck yourself
in your fucking asshole.

1065
01:19:27,252 --> 01:19:29,777
See?

1066
01:19:29,821 --> 01:19:32,016
Know what I'm talking about?

1067
01:19:32,057 --> 01:19:34,252
I don't think
this is going to work.

1068
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:35,624
We got a problem.

1069
01:19:43,702 --> 01:19:45,863
I've had this
done to me many times...

1070
01:19:45,904 --> 01:19:49,203
and I tell you, it's not fun.

1071
01:19:52,678 --> 01:19:54,737
You gonna tell us?
You gonna help us?

1072
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,907
Shock his dick.
That'll do the trick.

1073
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:59,577
I'm not touching his dick.

1074
01:19:59,618 --> 01:20:02,109
You hold his dick,
and I'll shock it.

1075
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:03,644
I don't do dicks.

1076
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:05,384
I'll do it.

1077
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,491
- How long?
- Five minutes.

1078
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:20,096
The fucking lift takes five
minutes to get to the penthouse.

1079
01:20:20,138 --> 01:20:23,164
Then we'd better hurry up.
You carry it.

1080
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,608
Look, you got to carry it.

1081
01:20:25,644 --> 01:20:28,306
Give it to Muki
and don't drop it.

1082
01:20:36,488 --> 01:20:38,820
Come here!
Get your ass back over here.

1083
01:20:40,826 --> 01:20:42,259
Don't try that shit again.

1084
01:20:43,362 --> 01:20:44,852
Leave the car running.

1085
01:20:46,665 --> 01:20:48,690
Hold up. Hold that.

1086
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:50,759
Will you please hurry up?

1087
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:52,770
Hand me that.

1088
01:20:54,473 --> 01:20:57,601
Listen to me.
Do not get out of this car.

1089
01:21:01,747 --> 01:21:03,772
Shut up and move.

1090
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:21,231
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

1091
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:24,394
Up to Muki.
I've got a present for his wife.

1092
01:21:24,436 --> 01:21:26,199
What about these two guys?

1093
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:27,899
They're my buddies.
I swear they're cool.

1094
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,406
Sure, OK.

1095
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:30,965
Sweet.

1096
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:00,870
No, no. This lift is full.

1097
01:22:00,906 --> 01:22:03,306
Please, just go away. Sorry.

1098
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:04,706
Come on. Come on.

1099
01:22:04,743 --> 01:22:06,608
Come on. Close.

1100
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:34,933
This is for Muki.

1101
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:39,944
It's heavy. What is it?

1102
01:22:39,978 --> 01:22:41,969
I've got to go.

1103
01:22:42,013 --> 01:22:43,640
Wait a minute. What is it?

1104
01:22:49,354 --> 01:22:51,083
What?

1105
01:22:54,559 --> 01:22:56,186
I can't hear you.

1106
01:22:56,228 --> 01:22:57,889
It's a fucking bomb!

1107
01:23:02,267 --> 01:23:04,167
What is it, man?

1108
01:23:15,046 --> 01:23:17,071
I think the fuse was a bit old.

1109
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,425
Yeah! Come on!

1110
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:46,269
Goddamn!

1111
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,191
Who are you?

1112
01:24:11,469 --> 01:24:14,063
What do you want?

1113
01:24:14,105 --> 01:24:18,201
We are the brothers of Steven,
and we've come to kill you!

1114
01:25:43,428 --> 01:25:44,622
Where's Muki?

1115
01:25:49,134 --> 01:25:50,567
I'm right here.

1116
01:26:15,727 --> 01:26:17,388
Damn!

1117
01:26:17,429 --> 01:26:20,193
Tried to shoot me in the back!

1118
01:26:20,231 --> 01:26:21,960
Little cheating bitch!

1119
01:26:35,847 --> 01:26:37,644
Drop the gun.

1120
01:26:42,987 --> 01:26:46,320
I said drop the fucking gun.

1121
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,884
Why should I?

1122
01:26:49,928 --> 01:26:52,294
So you can kill us both?

1123
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,991
You ready to die?

1124
01:26:54,032 --> 01:26:56,159
I'm ready.

1125
01:26:56,201 --> 01:26:57,828
Ready?

1126
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:02,299
Look like we all ready.

1127
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,680
Wait. Wait.

1128
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,246
Hold up. Take it easy.

1129
01:27:18,289 --> 01:27:20,154
Nobody got to die here.

1130
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:31,198
You fucking people!

1131
01:27:33,738 --> 01:27:36,866
You can't do anything
properly.

1132
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:40,241
Fucking South Africans!

1133
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:42,109
So...

1134
01:27:42,147 --> 01:27:46,584
now I have to punish you.

1135
01:27:46,618 --> 01:27:50,110
First... in the knees.

1136
01:27:51,322 --> 01:27:55,019
Then... in the guts.

1137
01:27:56,561 --> 01:27:58,552
So...

1138
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:02,431
who...

1139
01:28:02,467 --> 01:28:04,628
do...

1140
01:28:04,669 --> 01:28:07,069
I do first?

1141
01:28:50,415 --> 01:28:52,280
Game over, motherfucker.

1142
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:03,624
Let's move.

1143
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:06,693
Yeah, Muki was dead...

1144
01:29:06,731 --> 01:29:08,858
but not dead enough for me.

1145
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:12,358
I just couldn't turn my back
on the problem.

1146
01:29:12,403 --> 01:29:18,171
It was about family,
about blood, about home.

1147
01:29:18,209 --> 01:29:21,303
It looked like I wasn't gonna
get on that plane after all.

1148
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,846
Hey, baby, I had this idea...

1149
01:29:24,883 --> 01:29:27,249
and I wanted to know
what you think about it.

1150
01:29:27,285 --> 01:29:30,277
Why don't you go
to the airport...

1151
01:29:30,321 --> 01:29:32,721
get on a plane,
and come down here with me?

1152
01:29:32,757 --> 01:29:34,987
You want me to come
to South Africa?

1153
01:29:35,026 --> 01:29:37,586
It's about time
you saw where I come from.

1154
01:29:37,629 --> 01:29:39,620
So what do you say?

1155
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:41,757
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah?

1156
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:43,994
- Yeah.
- Cool!

1157
01:29:45,169 --> 01:29:48,570
I'm a happy man.
I'm a happy man.

1158
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:49,664
I'm happy, too.

1159
01:29:49,707 --> 01:29:51,607
This time
you call the travel agency...

1160
01:29:51,643 --> 01:29:53,201
and make the arrangements.

1161
01:29:53,244 --> 01:29:56,111
I'll do it.

1162
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:58,775
- Can't wait to see you.
- I love you.

1163
01:29:58,816 --> 01:30:00,044
Love you, too.

1164
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:01,813
- Bye.
- Bye.

1165
01:30:05,890 --> 01:30:07,949
So, what'd she say?

1166
01:30:07,992 --> 01:30:11,587
She said cool.
Wait till you meet her.

1167
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:13,028
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

1168
01:30:13,064 --> 01:30:16,591
Yeah.
So what you going to do?

1169
01:30:16,634 --> 01:30:19,467
I don't know.
There's this clinic...

1170
01:30:19,504 --> 01:30:21,665
in Hillbrow-
like a rehab center.

1171
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:24,174
I thought I might check in
there for a few weeks.

1172
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:26,904
You're not going to get clean
in no rehab center.

1173
01:30:26,945 --> 01:30:29,812
What you need is some fresh air
away from Jo-burg.

1174
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:32,179
Why don't you come
to the Transkei with us?

1175
01:30:32,216 --> 01:30:33,342
Me?

1176
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:35,978
No, him. Yeah, you.

1177
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:38,682
Yeah, you're welcome.
We can chill out.

1178
01:30:38,723 --> 01:30:39,917
Cool.

1179
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,323
Let's get the fuck
out of here.
