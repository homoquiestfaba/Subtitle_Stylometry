 Chesnia is a nation of criminals,
every day attack innocents

250
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
 citizen Russians,

 the stability is our interest.
La Paz in Chesnia is our interest

252
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,300

Oloff has not taken vacations in years and Vasket..

 Perhaps after the supper we can, not it?
- to make reservations.

 Creemos that 80%.

330
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
 What means that Nemorah finishes
mounting the most massive attack. 

331
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,500
 - in the history of the chemical war
We speak of the answer.

332
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,300
 the worse thing than we can do is nothing.
- I agree, if we left it.

333
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,400
 - to send chemical arms.
- That it follows? - Biologicas, nuclear.

334
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,400
 In agreement, as is the answer
more hard than we can send.

335
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,600
 Mandamos to the pacificadores.
- That does not solve anything.

336
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,500
 Well, they asked for recognition, so.

337
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600

00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
 - provisional,
soon we cause that the Ches request emergency aid to us.

339
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,800
 - national and we sent pacificadores.
- As we entered them?

340
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,800
 the fastest form would be to send them from Turkey.

341
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
 On airspace Arminy.
- To the devil with Russia, they no..

342
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,200
 - they are going away to complain.

343
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,600
 Hagamoslo.

344
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 Doctor Ryan who thinks?

345
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,900
 Sir president sabiduria
conventional suggests Nemorah

346
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,800
 - the Russian traditional paper
is playing, the aggressive ones desafian al..

347
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,400
 - world so that it stops them,
but Nemorah is not conventional.

348
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
 walks like a intransigente,
speaks like intransigente..

349
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,100
 If but yet respect not that is one.

350
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,800
 Acaba of destriur the capital of a country,
its respect is single yet.

351
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,300
 What so if Nemorah did not order the attack?

352
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,300
 - that so if he were a general,
or a unit of I exercise frustada by.

353
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,800
 - that could not remove the rest
from the rebels outside the city.

354
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,100
 Tiene some reason to think that I
do not order it or is guessing?

355
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
 you do not know it.

356
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,000
 I do not believe that it has done it, Sir.
- Apostaria that did not do it.

357
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,800
 That its personnel retires please by a minute.

358
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,000
 president Alexander Nemorah is going to go to the town.

359
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,900
 Disculpe Sir, can raise to him.

360
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,200
 Finally each nation has the right of defenderse..

361
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,600
 - the terrorism must finish,
the pump of Chesnia was my decision.

362
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,000
 Therefore becomes.

363
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,300
 general Phildyan Mitkin copied old Communists.

364
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,800
 Bastard.

365
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,300
 Sueltenlos- - the mataria i myself.

366
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,300
 Single desaparecelos.
- It's execution would not be good.

367
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,500
 Since our Russian friend
with this has been affected?

368
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,000
 I am not affected,
I remain devotee to our small plan.

369
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
 I am not surprised.

370
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,700
 and the American?
- She is a believer, I put to him little.

371
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,300
 - more than money in the account.
- So that '?

372
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,600
 So that vivira the sufficient
thing not to receive it.

373
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
 Where is the package?
- envio of Taifo for one week.

374
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,700
 says to Me that these things
can kill to me.

375
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,600
 I do not believe that this is good,
have changed so many things.

376
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,500
 Perhaps the new situation
suggests we use a different approach.

377
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,200
 to perhaps try to bring to Russia
a little more to Europe, a little more a..

378
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,600
 - our form to think

379
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
 Already we have discussed that,
and has been rejected.

380
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,600
 Perhaps we exceeded, perhaps our plan is.

381
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,700
 Is that?

382
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,600
 Not perfectly conceived.

383
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,400

- Around the world, all.

384
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,400

Russian Nazis, Aryan.

385
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,000
 - all working together.
- Is not that a perfect plan?

386
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,800
 I respect the decision of my friends
but in these two weeks I have myself.

387
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:33,900
 - returned incomodo, with this plan,
so I must request to them by my exit.

388
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,500
 Perhaps we help him to leave.

389
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,400
 BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

390
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,600
 Tengan taken care of with that thing,
is going to kill somebody.

391

 Hello Mase.

392

399
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
 the attack in Chesnia..

400
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
 Our forces estan in way to Chesnia,
to serve like.

401
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,600
 - pacificantes for aids to victimas
of this monstrous attack.

402
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,700
 I waited for that.
- Really?

403
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,700
 What you go to do?
- Nothing.

404
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,400
 we will not do anything.

405
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,400
 These has four hours
- they have not moved.

406
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
 So that they have not moved?
- Nemorah is very intelligent stops.

407
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,000
 - to move those tanks.
- The speech.

408
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,900
 Jack watches, Nemorah has as
19 thousand tanks there is no form of that.

409
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
 - they can compete with that.
- For that reason one is not going away them to move.

410
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,900
 Is like playing the chess,
this moving three pieces, knows.

411
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,500
 - that has many more tanks
than we and it knows that.

412
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,200
 - the only form that we must to stop
is using it nuclear weapons

413
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,900
 and does not want to risk a nuclear war by this.

414
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,900
 Creo that is sending us a message.

415
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,500
 the nonbombing to Roxny.

416
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,800

423
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,800
 That requires of much money.

424
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,100
 Single because the imbeciles of do not pay to him here,
does not mean that.

425

439
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,100
 So that it needs to do privily?

440

 Construye one of which nobody knows
it can take to Chesnia in.

442
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
 - the suitcase of its car,
would not be form to track it.

443
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800

Yet that that has sense.
