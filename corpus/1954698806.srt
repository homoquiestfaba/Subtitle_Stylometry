3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:05,871
           and sprung
             a leak.

4
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,339
             Who is
      responsible for this?

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,708
     I don't think I've ever
    seen you and masked girl

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,777
        in the same place
        at the same time.

7
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:12,544
        I'm Masked Girl.

9
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,382
          It was you!?

10
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,783
       You're Masked Girl!

11
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,585
          And you lied
         to me about it?

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,819
     I wanted to tell you--

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,654
        --but you didn't.

14
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:23,455
             Jared.

15
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,425
          I don't want
       to hear it, Corki.

16
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,294
   You know, I don't know what
   could hurt more than this.

17
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,497
   Except maybe this hangnail
    that's been keeping me up

18
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,299
         at night. but,
   that's a whole other story.

19
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,273
             Drama.

20
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,808
           And not the
          kind I teach.

00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,477
     <i> This is the all clear.</i>

00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,613
      <i> I repeat, all clear.</i>

    <i> Students, please return</i>

00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,224
        my life choices!

28
00:00:59,325 --> 00:00:59,958
         Okay, let's go.

29
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,166
             Nice going, newbie.

30
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,235
           Jared is so
         done with you.

31
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,437
            Oh yeah?

32
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,772
  We'll see who he likes better
    when my girl locks a spot

33
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,207
      on Homecoming Court.

34
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:15,707
What?

35
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,042
                   That's right!

36
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,179
 Kiss the crown goodbye, because
   Corki is going all the way.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,846
          Right, Corki?

38
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,115
               Um.

39
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,818
 She's still getting the hang of
 the whole witty-comeback-thing.

40
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,859
   Sharpen your pencil, Corki.

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,228
         Because you're
     about to get schooled.

42
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,131
        Yeah, well, maybe
    I enjoy getting schooled

43
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,267
        Because I value a
         good education.

44
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,139
           It was a good effort.

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,707
              She'll work on it.

46
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,785
        You really think
         this will work?

47
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,652
It has to.

48
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,821
If we let Valerie
tell us what to do,

49
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,791
we'll spend high school
in almost cool limbo.

50
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,227
And I am not
almost anything.

51
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,394
        Hear that, girls?

52
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,797
   It's the sound of a someone
    not making an impression

53
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,632
       on student voters.

54
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,334
          You're out of
       your league, Corki.

00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,736
         No freshman has
      ever beaten a senior

56
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,905
         and you're not

70

Deep-seeded
insecurities stemming

71
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,244
from a
perfect childhood.

72
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,479
            That makes no sense.

73
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,347
      It makes total sense.

74
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,249
       All perfect people
      are hiding something!

75
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,817
              I thought you said
               you were perfect.

76
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,586
             I'm the
     exception to the rule.

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,987
                  Don't worry
                  about Valerie.

78
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,823
   She's just jealous because
     you might actually win.

79
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,360
     But it was Masked Girl
    who was popular, not me.

80
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,496
            We're not
        giving up, Corki.

81
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,199
We just need a
brilliant campaign,

82
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,368
      which means we need a
   brilliant campaign manager,

83
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,537
           which means
           we need me.

84
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,573
         You guys really
     think I stand a chance?

85
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,807
        Of course you do.

86
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,610
     You just need a total,
        irrational belief

87
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,745
       that everything you
         do is awesome,

88
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,814
      no matter the reality
        of the situation.

89
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,282
               That's called
               being delusional.

90
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,686
       Nooooo, it's called
        being a dreamer.

91
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,554
         Or a web celeb.

92
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,855
                  Or delusional.

93
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,025
                 A little higher
                 on the left.

94
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,062
                         <i> Right.</i>

96
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,030
                             No!

97
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,367
       When I said "right"
   I mean the left is correct.

98
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,602
        This is my left.

99
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,137
    I know because it has my
      left bracelet on it.

100
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,641
             Right!

101
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,278
          I remember my
        homecoming days,

102
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,882
     when we would re-unite,
partake in gluttonous endeavors,

103
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,053
            frolic in
        the fall leaves.

104
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,456
            No one's
        listening to me.

105
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,625
          Lovely job on
      the banner, Heather.

106
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,827
           Keep it up.

107
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,162
     Mr. Stark, that's what
        the rope is for.

108
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,937
         Let's give this
           a test run.

109
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,505
Ouuu!

110
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,041
      Thank you, thank you,
        you're too kind.

111
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,911
    Of course I'll autograph
     that for you, Heather.

112
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,516
       Um, Valerie, that's
        permanent marker.

113
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,817
           Lucky you!

114
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,753
           I love it!

115
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,890
<i>This is</i>
          <i> a disaster!</i>

116
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,893
        I just received a
    last minute cancellation

117
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,795
     from the Homecoming DJ.

118
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,564
   <i> I think we have different</i>
    <i> definitions of disaster</i>

119
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,668
           Mr. Stark,
     earthquakes, monsoons,

120
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,102
           dates that
         dine and dash,

121
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:04,503
              What?

122
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,704
              What?

123
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,440
      Those are disasters.

124
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,611
But without music, how will they
   be overtaken by the rhythm.

125
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,646
    They'll just dance like--

126
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,049
        Eeeehhhh, eeeeh!

127
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,788
             --that.

128
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,590
         Please don't do
       that in my office.

129
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,826
      Just find another DJ.

130
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:28,593
              But--

131
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,128
         You can go now.

132
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,203
                  This paint job
                  is ugh,

133
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,972
                     It's really
                     something.

134
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,752
       Man, where did
        Mr. Stark go?

135
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,456
           Hey Caleb!

136
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,623
          Oh hey, Jodi.

137
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,658
         How's it goin'?

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,126
          Hey, have you
         seen Mr. Stark?

139
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,027
               No.

140
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,336
          So, listen...

141
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,806
   I've been thinking and the
    homecoming dance is soon,

142
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,676
       so, since I'm going
       and you're going--

143
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,212
   Hey, you know what, this is
      great small talk but,

144
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,847
       I really gotta go!

145
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,318
                 Corki,
                 for homecoming!

146
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,953
This is what it
takes to win.

147
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,023
   Posters, buttons an online
     campaign at warp speed.

148
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm averaging 75 new
fans an hour.

149
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,029
    And people laughed at my
    daily finger excersises.

150
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,199
   If we play this right, you
    could be crowned a queen,

151
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,701
     in a Jodi Mapa design.

152
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,302

187
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,278
                         Button?

188
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,146
      Corki for Homecoming,
       get a free button!

189
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,717
                   I'm so sorry.

190
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,052
It's okay.

191
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,324
           I mean it.

192
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,992
           I am sorry.

193
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,661
      I never meant to
         lie to you,

194
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,197
   I just couldn't let anyone
know it was me behind that mask.

195
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,166
              Why?

196
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,602
          I can't say.

197
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,471
  It's kind of like how I never
      tell anyone about the

198
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,775
 black-and-white artsy photos of
   flowers I take on weekends.

199
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,476
             You do?

200
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,844
    Let's change the subject.

201
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,881
      Too much information.

202
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,783
            Would you
         wear my button?

203
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,318
              Sure.

204
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,220
      So apology accepted?

205
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,791
        I'm a bigger man
       than most, so yes.

206
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,925
        Nobody's perfect.

207
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,360
        Even Masked Girl?

208
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,804
          Now you'll be
     looking at me all day.

209
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,305
   Especially my chin region.

210
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,918
  Mr. Stark, I've been looking
       for you everywhere.

211
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,053
          I heard your
        DJ bailed on you.

212
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,088
              Hmm.

213
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,823
      No, Come on, I've got
       tons of experience.

214
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,224
            Two years
         as a house DJ.

215
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,258
       Impressive, where?

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,260
      My family's basement,
      I went on every night

217
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,662
      and my Nana loved it.

218
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,298
   Well, DJ'ing a MacKendrick
         Prep homecoming

219
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,333
      is a different beast
      entirely, Mr. Davis.

220
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,970
  It's about striking a balance
   between old and new music,

221
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,740
      Mmm, catering to all
       tastes and styles--

222
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,341
              I'll play at least
              10% show tunes.

223
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:43,875
Twenty.

224
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,810
                        Fifteen.

225
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,179
Welcome to the prestigious
world of a high school DJ.

226
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
                            Yes!

227
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,916
Ahem!

228
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:52,951
Stop that.

229
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,352
Stop that, don't.

230
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,021
Hmph!

231
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,959
    My campaign is working--
  people are talking about you.

232
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,863
   That doesn't look like the
 friendly kind of talk we want.

233
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,864
They're nervous.

234
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,167
Probably too awestruck
to meet you in person.

235
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,669
          Hey, newbie.

236
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,270
          Nice try with
          the campaign.

237
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:17,008
That Masked-Girl-thing was cute,
    but it's so two-days-ago.

238
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,877
        Better luck when
        you're a senior.

239
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,384
                         Sun Hi!

240
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,087
                 We have to
                 get those down!

241
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,255
          Don't worry.

242
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,824
        No way that many
   people have seen them yet.

243
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,242
     Well this looks like an
    inordinately large amount

244
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,510
          of equipment.

245
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:56,014
   I'm going to make this the
best Homecoming ever, Mr. Stark.

246
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,184
      I just need access to
      the main power system

247
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,721
 so I can connect my subwoofers
   to the tactile transducers.

248
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:09,160
Caleb. I'm hearing a lot of
"Untz Untz Untz"

249
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:15,366
But I what I wanna be hearing
5-6-7-8, ta-ta, ta-ta,

250
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,336
     annnnnnddd jazz hands!

251
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,306
  You're not familiar with the
   "Caleb Sound Effect Theory"

252
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,075
          where more is
        better, are you?

253
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,376
               No.

254
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,980
  You will be, then you'll know
   I'm the man to do music for

255
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,282
   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

256
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,719
      One thing at a time,
           Mr. Davis.

257
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,955
      One thing at a time.

258
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,760
       Caleb, I'm going to
     the dance this Friday,

259
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,927
     and I'm going with you.

260
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,229
             Got it?

261
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,164
      Wow, that felt good.

262
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,966
              Jodi, I don't know
              what to say.

263
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,801
If you know
what's good for you,

264
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,970
  you'll say that you've never
     felt more excited about

265
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,938
anything in your life.

266
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,974
     I'd like to say that--

267
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,310
       But I can't be your
      date, I'm DJ-ing it.

268
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,411
        You got the gig?

269
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,746
       Pretty cool, right?

270
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,814
              Yeah.

271
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,215
      That's great, Caleb.

272
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,917
             Thanks.

273
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,920
     So technically we'll be
     at the dance together--

274
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,054
           Just not--

275
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,322
            together.

276
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,830
  Hey, let me know if you have
    any song requests, okay?

277
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,899
         Sure, will do!

278
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,005
           If that was
         any indication,

279
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,140
       it would have been
      fun dancing with you.

280
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,048
    This Homecoming election

281
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,751
    shouldn't be about cheap
      mudslinging tactics.

282
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,420
       It should be about
      character and ethics.

283
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,323
   That's why, moving forward,
   I will continue to conduct

284
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,760
        my campaign with
    integrity and positivity.

285
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,863
   Because it's the right way,
     it's the honorable way,

286
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,865
            it's the
      MacKendrick Prep way.

287
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,033
           Thank you.

288
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,242
     I see you're using the
 personal touch and reaching out

289
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,744
          to the voters
         one at a time.

290
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,052
Um Val,
there's a door there.

291
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,121
             Look on
        the bright side.

292
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,724
       No one saw her make
      fun of you this time.

293
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,625
          I'm quitting.

294
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,826
                 You can't quit!

295
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,895
  Someone needs to show Valerie
    and her peppy goon squad

296
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,730
          that how they
       behave isn't cool.

297
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,732
      I don't want to prove
      anything to Valerie.

298
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,734
         I just want to
        be a nice person.

299
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,102
        Didn't you listen
          to my speech?

300
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,804
        Of course I did.

301
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,138
          It was about
       Homecoming, right?

302
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,242
 Look, I know you mean well, but
   every time you try to help,

303
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,611
        the Spirit Squad
        just get weirder.

304
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,812
         I know, right?

305
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,814
       We're a good team.

306
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,084
              Ugh!

307
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,020
      If Caleb won't go to
       the dance with me,

308
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,922
           at least my
       dress can be there.

309
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,958
         Maybe, I should
            take you.

310
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,895
       A couple of dummies
       on the dance floor.

311
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,063
          Why did I ask
       Caleb to the dance?

312
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,834
       What are you doing?

313
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,003
         Definitely not
       hugging this dummy.

314
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,804
Hey, check this out.

315
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,973
          This dress is
         gonna be sick!

316
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,776
 It's my statement that I don't
 care about going to Homecoming.

317
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:12,877
      I'm not going either.

318
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,178
             What?!

319
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,182
     That means my statement
 about not going won't be going!

320
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,250
             Arghhh.

321
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,153
           Move over.

322
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,354
             Arghh!

323
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,093
             Selfie!

324
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,130
              Ahh!

325
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:32,997
         What'd I miss?

326
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,832
            Neither of us is
            going to Homecoming.

327
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,301
        Ugh, yes you are.

328
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,204
  We still have a shot at this
  thing, nothing is impossible.

329
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,006
         Except kissing
         your own elbow.

330
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,841
     Believe me, I've tried.

331
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,209
Good pep talk,
Sun Hi.

332
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,179
Especially the part that made me
 picture you kissing your elbow.

333
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,029
            Sad song.

334
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,331
              Yeah.

335
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,899
     It's an original piece.

336
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,869
  "Literal Interpretation of My
    Current Emotional State."

337
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,605
             Catchy.

338
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,140
      Things that bad, huh?

339
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,844
     I don't want to run for
    Homecoming Court anymore.

340
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,879
      Well, if that's what
       you think is best.

341
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,914
         Too bad though.

342
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,249
     I was coming around to
     the idea of you and me

343
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,386
          on Homecoming
         Court together.

344
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,320
            You were?

345
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,356
         Uh-oh, too much
          information.

346
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,357
           I gotta go.

347
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,197
  I talked to Jared, I'm going
      to stay in the race.

348
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,898
That's great,
Corki.

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,668
At least my
dress will be there.

350
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,003
         Oh, no, Corki.

351
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,105
     Your campaign to become
    invisible in this school,

352
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,173
    <i> didn't exactly work out.</i>

353
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,209
      I can still see you!

354
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,745
      Sun Hi, don't do it.

355
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,680
              Argh.

356
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,315
      Fine, If that's what
        you want, Corki.

357
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,351
   I guess sometimes in life,
 it's best to just admit defeat

358
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,919
         and walk away.

359
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,023
            Glad you
      finally smartened up.

360
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,924
     I'm impressed, Sun Hi.

361
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,227
           You handled
       that very maturely.

362
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,295
Our little girl
is growing up.

363
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,131
              It was bound to
              happen eventually.

364
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,103
             Or not.

365
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,247
              You.

366
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,115
Oh Valerie!

367
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,818
You match
your bathrobe!

368
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
        This isn't over!

369
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,259
   I guess the guy at the joke
      Store wasn't kidding

370
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,828
     when he said, a little
        goes a long way.

371
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,065
  Sun Hi, I told you this isn't
  how I want to conduct myself.

372
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,234
    I'm not like them, I want
    to stay true to who I am

373
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,503
       and what I believe
         no matter what.

374
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,338
          It's time you
     start respecting that.

375
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,477
                  It washes off.

376
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,478
                     Eventually.

377

Check it out, some
    Corki fans in the crowd.

409
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,551
         I'm gonna need
           more power.

410
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,354
     It'll be fun to see you
  get on the Homecoming court.

411
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,388
            You mean
         you're coming?

412
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,856
              Yeah.

413
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,992
         I don't need a
        date to have fun.

414
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,426
          Great, Jodi.

415
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,395
         Just don't plan
        on talking to me.

416
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,365
 I'll be busy getting mobbed by
 fans after my solo performance.

417
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,567
       And then Mr. Stark
    will cast me as Dorothy,

418
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,469
          and my career
        will be launched.

419
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,138
          Ah, it's good
            to be me.

420
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,541
   This could end up being an
  awesome Homecoming after all.

421
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,345
         What was that?

422
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,521
      That would be another
        safety violation.
