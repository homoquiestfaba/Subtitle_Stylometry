1
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:05,101
I'm off men,

2
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,833
Right now...
in my life.

3
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:08,402
Are you completely
in the closet?

4
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:09,838
I'm 100% straight.

5
00:00:10,236 --> 00:00:10,870
You sold the house?

6
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:12,169
I need the money.

7
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:13,877
Re-shoots.

8
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,342
Get in the car,
you're going to destiny's.

9
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:17,344
You look like
you need a good shag.

10
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:18,545
Married.

11
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:19,780
You're free to have

12
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:20,950
An affair.

13
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,449
What does the web site say?

14
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:24,619
First rule
in the "wife of" handbook

15
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:26,954
Check your jealousy
at the door.

16
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,723
Someone must
have stolen my journal

17
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,094
And is selling off
little tidbits.

18
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,697
He's figured out that
it's the hollywood ex-wife.

19
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:35,263
He pretty well
described you to a tee.

20
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:37,233
I'm the hollywood ex-wife.

21
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:43,639
When people find out,
they are going to be pissed.

22
00:00:46,608 --> 00:00:47,408
I just want to apologize

23
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:48,950
To liz's mom

24
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:51,545
And eve's mom

25
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:53,682
And my mom.

26
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm so sorry to everyone.

27
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:01,789
It was all my fault.

28
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:04,426
I was the one
who brought my stupid journal

29
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,962
To that stupid party and
left my stupid birken bag

30
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:09,162
Lying where anyone could
rifle through it.

31
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,335
I'm so sorry
for what happened.

32
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:27,381
What was that?

33
00:01:32,187 --> 00:01:32,787
Where is everyone?

34
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:34,555
I poisoned the well,

35
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:35,824
Pooped where i eat

36
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,592
And every other metaphor
that means

37
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:39,626
The people i see
every day hate my guts.

38
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,030
I'm a pariah

39
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,135
And i don't know what
to do.

40
00:01:50,504 --> 00:01:51,471
And i'm not sure i ever will.

41
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,943
It's been said that hollywood
is just high school with money.

42
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:56,476
And that kind of nails it.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,146
Popularity
is still the highest calling

44
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:00,082
To which one can aspire.

45
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,351
But now the popular kids
are the ones

46
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,787
That have three picture deals
instead of football trophies.

47
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:07,688
And the geeks are the ones
with the movie that tanked

48
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,123
At the box office
over the weekend.

49
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:11,224
Oh!

50
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:12,559
Useless!

51
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,830
But one thing
is exactly like high school.

52
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,164
Nobody likes a tattle-tale.

53
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:19,465
Excuse me.

54
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:21,002
Oh!

55
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:22,636
I overheard you confessing
last night

56
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,739
To liz in the bathroom.

57
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:25,872
Even my husband didn't know

58
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:28,874
That i had put stella
and stanley's ashes

59
00:02:30,013 --> 00:02:30,480
In my breasts.

60
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:32,711
I am so sorry.

61
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,185
Is it so crazy
to love your dogs?

62
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:36,381
No.

63
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:37,587
To mourn them
when they die?

64
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:39,221
No.

65
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,653
To want to keep them as close
to your heart

66
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:42,087
As you possibly can

67
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:43,192
Forever and ever?

68
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:44,358
Uh...

69
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:45,495
Is that so crazy, molly?

70
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:46,961
Uh...

71
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,099
Have you ever lost a pet?

72
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:55,604
Well,
obviously not.

73
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,840
You broke the confidentiality
code of starting gate.

74
00:02:58,437 --> 00:02:59,203
There's no confidenti--

75
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:01,106
It's implied.

76
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:02,544
Now i've convened
with all the committee heads

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,907
And we have voted you out.

78
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,247
Stripped
of all committee membership

79
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:06,883
Of the starter gate parent
association.

80
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:08,751
But i'm the head
of two committees:

81
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:10,514
Snow day and car pool.

82
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:11,785
No longer!

83
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,086
Carrie bergen is now
in charge of snow day

84
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,388
And leana unger
is the new car pool head.

85
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:42,716
Your vest.

86
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,099
Finally a makeup so smart

87
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:31,667
It knows your perfect shade.

88
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,034
Smart shade makeup from almay.

89
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,035
Breakthrough shade
sensing technology

90
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:38,206
Starts out white
and adjusts to right.

91
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,006
Matching your skin tone.

92
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,741
And try new
smart shade concealer...

93
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:46,645
From almay.

94
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:48,384
Mankind can wait.

95
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,618
This superhero is building his
own capital one credit card.

96
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,089
I want airline miles,

97
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:54,324
A low interest rate,

98
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:58,055
And a heroic picture
of my family.

99
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,598
Surprise!

100
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:03,798
Mmmm... guacamole.

101
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:06,067
Personalize your card
at capital one card lab.

102
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,636
Choose your rewards,
interest rate,

103
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,973
Even upload your own image
at capitalone.com.

104
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,838
Honey?

105
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,300
What's in your wallet?

106
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,875
Rton's
"more where that came from"

107
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,904
I wanna be your satisfaction

108
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,239
Be your number one

109
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,350
And just when you think
i can't love you any better

110
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:56,878
Well, i have just begun

111
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:59,581
'cause there's more
where that came from

112
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,757
There's more where
that came from

113
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:11,127
Get more for less.

114
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:51,459
It's target.

115
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:54,197
Hey.

116
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,536
What's with
the pouty face?

117
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,006
Are you upset or are you
going for a look?

118
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,508
I don't know what
to do with my face.

119
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:02,278
Okay, being despised
is a new experience.

120
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:03,574
Were you at the meeting?

121
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:05,379
Yeah, let me
tell you something...

122
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,547
There are some bitter hoes
in the p.t.a.

123
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:09,049
You're not even allowed

124
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:10,619
To show up for snow day.

125
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,121
The whole thing
was my idea.

126
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:14,553
There's never been fake snow
at starting gate.

127
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,924
I'll take pictures
for you and then meanwhile,

128
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,803
You have some fences
to mend.

129
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,091
You know
how sorry i am.

130
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,593
Aww...
not me, ma.

131
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:27,767
We're fine.

132
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:33,441
Thank you.

133
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:36,045
What kind of cupcake basket
says, "sorry i told the world

134
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,047
"you do threesomes
with fat people"?

135
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,108
One with a prius
in it.

136
00:08:41,017 --> 00:08:41,150
Hey!

137
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,249
How bout one
with a teddy bear?

138
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,421
Look everyone
knows dizzy land works

139
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,021
Out of that coffee bean
in west hollywood.

140
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,423
Let's all go kick the crap
out of him.

141
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,326
Tomorrow, 3:30 on,
i'm good.

142
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:51,787
I'll bring the crowbar.

143
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,225
Why make
a big, ugly scene

144
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:56,492
When you can fix it
with cupcakes?

145
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,433
Oh, oh.

146
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,466
How's the crush going?

147
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:02,004
Oh boring!

148
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:03,339
Do we really have
to hear more

149
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,239
About rodney's
impossible dream?

150
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:07,143
You guys ever hear
of the dl?

151
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:08,642
The dalai lama.

152
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:09,677
The daily lantern?

153
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,846
The dreaded leopard.

154
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:13,816
This isn't a game show.

155
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,585
It stands
for the down low.

156
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:18,187
It's a thing
with some black guys.

157
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,089
They consider themselves
straight,

158
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,622
But they have sex
with men.

159
00:09:23,018 --> 00:09:23,585
Sounds gay to me.

160
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:24,627
No.

161
00:09:25,324 --> 00:09:25,624
Oh, yeah.

162
00:09:26,662 --> 00:09:26,929
Shut up!

163
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,393
You're right,
it's not that interesting.

164
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,294
I'm late for work,
talk fast.

165
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:31,696
Rodney, when?
how?

166
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:32,768
Who started it?

167
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,436
Why would he think he
was straight?

168
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:36,704
You cannot breathe a word
about this.

169
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:39,004
Oh, of course not.
no.

170
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:44,243
Look who
i'm confiding in.

171
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:45,681
Me and my mates were

172
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,649
Always into a bit
of skullduggery.

173
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:48,982
Nothing serious.

174
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,583
A bit of thievery
now and again.

175
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:54,186
Mum...

176
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,059
Mum used to box me ears

177
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,460
With a hug and a wink,
if you know what i mean.

178
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:04,398
But uh...

179
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,133
When dad came home
from the r.a.f.

180
00:10:09,138 --> 00:10:10,838
Well, all bets
were off then.

181
00:10:13,174 --> 00:10:15,474
He needed somewhere
to put all his anger and rage.

182
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,847
And i guess i was
the logical choice.

183
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:21,982
It's okay.

184
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,855
I weren't much good
for my old man...

185
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,554
But i was good for that.

186
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:32,360
Oh, please.

187
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:34,095
You're kidding, right?

188
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,661
You're not really trying
to get away with this.

189
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:38,094
That whole speech was
from his movie,

190
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,201
The laddy
from nottingham.

191
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:48,774
Excellent!

192
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:50,378
You're wasting
our time, david.

193
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,416
Joan, please escort mr. shay
back to his room.

194
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,313
I knew it;
you're a fan.

195
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,686
I am a fan.

196
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,418
Julie, this is
so sudden.

197
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:01,422
With peter o'toole,
he played your dad

198
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,358
Unless you were too drunk
to notice.

199
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:10,099
Oh.

200
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:12,935
Mm-hmm.

201
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:14,737
It's...

202
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:16,805
You, kenny.

203
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,301
Where's jayden's room?

204
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,177
Right
over there.

205
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:26,646
Oh.

206
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:30,919
This is lovely.

207
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,154
Is jayden going to sleep
in a box?

208
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,057
Relax, she's not here
'til friday.

209
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:37,524
Just make sure

210
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,455
That mr. octopus is
on the bed when she comes,

211
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:42,031
Okay?

212
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:44,096
Mm-mmm.

213
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,734
You know where he is,
right?

214
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,067
Pretty sure it's not
in storage.

215
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:50,903
It's not an "it",
it's a "he"!

216
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:53,774
Oh, for god's sake,
kenny.

217
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,308
This is a tough transition
for her.

218
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:57,742
What are you going
to do

219
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,515
If you can't find
mr. octopus by friday?

220
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,612
We'll bring daddy teddy
from your house.

221
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,485
No, daddy teddy
can't leave my house!

222
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:05,080
Why not?
is he agoraphobic?

223
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,484
What are you
getting so crazy about?

224
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:10,255
I need to know
that when jaden comes here

225
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,925
That you are going
to put our daughter first.

226
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:15,929
You get distracted,
kenny, by shiny objects.

227
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,167
But mostly by yourself.

228
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:20,736
Molly, come on.

229
00:12:20,746 --> 00:12:22,364
Have i ever
let you down?

230
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:26,637
Find...

231
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:28,604
The friggin'...

232
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:34,148
Octopus.

233
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,681
Hey, i can say that it's
from both of us, right?

234
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:44,390
Oh!
trying to hide, molly?

235
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,626
I'd like to hide too,
since you told everyone

236
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:47,858
I was a chubby-chaser!

237
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,164
But you've made
that impossible.

238
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:50,599
Well, maybe
if you didn't scream.

239
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:51,665
Did you get my cupcakes?

240
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,634
What kind of a low-life
exposes

241
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:55,034
Her so-called friends

242
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:56,103
For her own
self-aggrandizement?!

243
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,139
Hi, honey!

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,340
How was school?

245
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,541
Look, i understand
that you're upset.

246
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:00,742
I'm going to go home,
i'll call you,

247
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:01,842
And we'll discuss it.

248
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:02,908
What kind of a degenerate

249
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:04,176
Are you?!

250
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,310
Can we stay calm?

251
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,344
You've got a lot of nerve

252
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:07,349
Showing up here!

253
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,981
I'll talk
to you later.

254
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:12,718
Why was
that lady shouting?

255
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,186
It was just
a misunderstanding, honey.

256
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:15,255
It's okay.

257
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,157
But she was so mad
at us.

258
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,325
She wasn't mad at you.

259
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:19,693
She was mad at me.

260
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:21,094
But mommy's going
to fix it.

261
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:25,566
Hello.

262
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,001
Are you all right?

263
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,336
I've been better.

264
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:31,605
I'm going to shut down
that web site.

265
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,806
When i'm finished
with dizzy land,

266
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,209
He's not going
to know what hit him.

267
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,910
How late is he
at that coffee bean?

268
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,046
I've just got
to figure out

269
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,112
What i'm going to do
with jayden.

270
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,082
Go home,
be with your kid.

271
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:44,152
Give you a chance
to calm down.

272
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:46,520
Tomorrow morning we'll go
when the girls are at school.

273
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:48,254
Right after drop-off.

274
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:50,122
First thing.

275
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:52,191
Okay.

276
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:53,792
Thank you.

277
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:57,095
Again.

278
00:13:58,698 --> 00:13:58,865
Damn.

279
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:05,574
Where'd it go?

280
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:11,411
You're using a knife?

281
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,214
I'll see to it
that you're not splitting

282
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,379
Any more pills at destiny's.

283
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:20,086
Ouch.

284
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:24,489
Pill cutter.

285
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:25,924
Gloves.

286
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,027
Joan, are you ready

287
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:29,295
For this?

288
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,397
David shay says
you are vital to his recovery

289
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:35,402
Because
of your refreshing honesty.

290
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,269
I want you to focus all
of your attention on him.

291
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,737
We'll divvy
up your other clients.

292
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:41,708
No way,
i'm very attached to, um,

293
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,678
What's-his-name
and the other one.

294
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:48,014
Can i persuade you
to work through the weekend?

295
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:49,417
Will you give gary

296
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:51,352
All the menial mindless tasks

297
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:52,350
For the next two weeks?

298
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:53,954
Done.

299
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,421
Hey, if anyone should
be doing menial mindless work

300
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:56,487
It's you.

301
00:14:57,457 --> 00:14:57,591
Why?

302
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:02,496
Because you are...

303
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:04,295
Menial and mindless!

304
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:08,434
Okay.

305
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:09,803
So you'll do it?

306
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:12,007
I'll think about it.
think yes.

307
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,447
I'll uh--
i'll owe you one.

308
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:27,355
Wow.

309
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,521
You're absolutely sure these
are ashlee simpson's

310
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:29,624
Blood results?

311
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:31,625
What kind of low-life

312
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:33,395
Exposes innocent people

313
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:34,491
For their own
self-aggrandizement?

314
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:35,530
Pace yourself.

315
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:37,432
Molly kagan!

316
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:39,631
The hollywood ex-wife
in the flesh.

317
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm dying.

318
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,838
Those things i wrote
were private.

319
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,806
Oh, honey, there is
no private anymore.

320
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,906
Haven't you noticed?

321
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,140
You listen to me.

322
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:51,178
Listen to me!

323
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:52,709
I am going to get
an injunction

324
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:53,748
Against you.

325
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:54,915
And then i'm going
to bring

326
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,349
Down the wrath
of god on you.

327
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:58,652
I love it!

328
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:00,220
The hollywood ex-wife
threatens me

329
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:02,322
With "the wrath of god".

330
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:04,390
It writes itself.

331
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,693
Don't type that.
why are you typing that?

332
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:09,028
"with me right now
is none other than the ex-- "

333
00:16:09,497 --> 00:16:10,997
Stop that...
stop that!

334
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,168
Molly, molly, moll--

335
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:14,736
Give it to me,
give it--

336
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:16,505
Ah!

337
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:17,706
Oh no!

338
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:24,576
Oh no.

339
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,012
Good golly,
miss molly.

340
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,493
D"mzm?o?mzm?ozmzm?ozm?o?ozmzmzm?o?ozm?ozm?o?ozm?ozmzmz

341
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:48,160
Morning kids!

342
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:49,429
Oh! pancakes.

343
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:51,098
I knew you'd be happy.

344
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,365
Bisquick shake 'n pour.

345
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,935
Just add water,
shake, and pour.

346
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:56,269
Bisquick shake 'n pour.

347
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,310
Shake, pour, make.

348
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:12,784
Making your home look like
a picture in a magazine...

349
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:14,286
With walmart's
prices on the new

350
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:15,756
Better homes and
gardens collection,

351
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:18,826
You can do anything.

352
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,060
See the entire line of

353
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,060
Better homes and gardens
furnishings,

354
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:25,731
Only at walmart.

355
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,765
Save money.
live better.

356
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:32,440
Walmart.

357
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:35,442
Something soft and smooth.

358
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:39,144
Or something natural
for a healthy look.

359
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:40,280
Chapstick.

360
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:14,137
Because healthy lips
should never go naked.

361
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,577
I went to calcutta
for three months,

362
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,110
Came back with malaria.

363
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,251
My wife never
gave me a straw.

364
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
She also never
gave you malaria.

365
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:27,317
I see.

366
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:29,324
Straw of guilt.

367
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,559
Keep your head
still.

368
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,994
Okay, i want to ask you
some questions.

369
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:35,192
Yes, i noticed you at school

370
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,068
Before you came
to writing class.

371
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,132
No, that's not what i--

372
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:43,438
Really?

373
00:20:43,448 --> 00:20:45,206
I want to make sure
that your cognitive ability

374
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,436
Is okay.

375
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:51,012
Shoot.

376
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,443
Who was
our first president?

377
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:54,382
George washington.

378
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:56,810
What's the capital
of france?

379
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:00,688
"f".

380
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,449
Who's the secretary
of the interior?

381
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:06,928
Um...

382
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:08,894
I think you
have a concussion.

383
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:11,299
Are my pupils dilated?

384
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,499
Let's see.
you're fine.

385
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:16,902
Um...

386
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,806
Just make sure you
put the ice on there

387
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:21,105
For another 20 minutes.

388
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:27,346
Ow.

389
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:31,418
Not bad for a guy
with a pulled groin muscle.

390
00:21:31,428 --> 00:21:33,585
Don't be telling anyone
where that happened.

391
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:35,056
Don't need that
on the internet,

392
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:37,325
"devon marsh sidelined by his

393
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,291
Hot, sexy wife".

394
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,599
"...who cannot
get enough".

395
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:51,967
What's that smell?

396
00:21:52,574 --> 00:21:52,974
That's j-lo.

397
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:54,105
I don't know j-lo.

398
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,310
The perfume, devon.
who you been kissing?

399
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:57,845
You must wear j-lo.

400
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,644
Don't start with me,
baby.

401
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:01,546
I might've got
some samples.

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,047
I gotta go.

403
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,450
I bet you debbie
from dodgertown

404
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:06,950
Got some samples too!

405
00:22:13,053 --> 00:22:13,187
Bye.

406
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:14,693
You're
the featured video.

407
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:16,495
I love the title,
"mohammad moll-ee".

408
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:18,063
That's your teacher?

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,500
I want to go
to school.

410
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:27,474
I really hate today.

411
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,542
I hate that i can't turn
on an electrical device

412
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:31,643
Without seeing myself
doing something stupid.

413
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,547
I hate that-that-

414
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,016
Liz has to pick up jayden,

415
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,518
Because my daughter doesn't want
to be seen with me.

416
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,917
And i don't think tomorrow's
going to be much better, either.

417
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:41,351
I've got an idea.

418
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,822
Come to destiny's
with me on the weekend.

419
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,823
Anthea owes me,
they've got a spare room,

420
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:49,363
No cell phone,
no tv, no internet...

421
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:50,563
No clogged toilet.

422
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,534
I don't have a clogged
toil-- oh.

423
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,103
No, i'm not running away.

424
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:58,940
Although now i kind
of want to.

425
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:02,143
Staying put,
i can handle this.

426
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,670
And since when
do you work weekends?

427
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:05,044
Oh.
doesn't pappy mind?

428
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:07,746
The only thing pappy minds
is the thought

429
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,383
Of having sex with me.

430
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:10,380
What do you mean?

431
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,014
He's given me up
for lent...

432
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:14,722
Or forever--
whichever lasts longer.

433
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:17,352
Can he not,
you know...

434
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:20,757
Stand me?

435
00:23:21,627 --> 00:23:22,093
Oh no, no, no.

436
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,194
No, it's not physical.

437
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,397
He'd just rather
watch charlie rose

438
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:27,900
Than sleep with me.

439
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:30,134
Which may have been going
on for years.

440
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,036
But i was too drunk
to notice.

441
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:34,339
Well, and--
so that's that?

442
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:35,470
No more sex?

443
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:37,071
No, no, no,
this is the best part,

444
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,777
He said
i can have an affair

445
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:43,680
As long as i don't
fall in love.

446
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:44,783
Good deal, right?

447
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:45,816
It's cruel.

448
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:46,986
No, it's brilliant.

449
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:49,619
He's thought long and hard
about this,

450
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,626
How to keep me
without having me.

451
00:23:53,227 --> 00:23:53,694
If i were you,

452
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:55,396
I would have sex
with the first thing

453
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,661
That walked
through that door.

454
00:23:59,127 --> 00:23:59,294
Oh...

455
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,464
What about
the second thing?

456
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:03,402
Oh...

457
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:05,471
Maybe i should've
left buster in the car.

458
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:07,241
The kids are out back.

459
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,043
Thanks for
picking her up.

460
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,871
Come on in,
you know everybody.

461
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:12,243
Is this
your clubhouse?

462
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:14,174
Is there
a secret handshake?

463
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,148
Yeah.
and no boys allowed.

464
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:19,352
Good.

465
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:20,986
Devon has been acting
a little crazy

466
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,492
Ever since he's been
on the dl.

467
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,192
Devon is
on the dl?

468
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:29,796
Yeah.

469
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:31,764
He's got a strained groin.

470
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:33,494
It happens.

471
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,967
That's
what i tell him,

472
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:35,967
Just give it a rest,
baby.

473
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:36,967
But he just--
he wants

474
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:38,272
To get
out there every night.

475
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:40,973
And you're-
you're okay with this?

476
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,577
Every player spends time
on the disabled list.

477
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:44,842
Disabled list?

478
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,477
Yeah, it's where they
put the injured ball players.

479
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,881
What did you think
being on the dl...?

480
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:54,215
Oh, oh!

481
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:59,423
You guys really don't know
anything about baseball.

482
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,958
Oh, your flowers
have just closed up.

483
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:04,965
Kenny's here.

484
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,765
I wish it wasn't
kenny's weekend.

485
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:08,767
Jayden!

486
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:10,065
Get your stuff together.

487
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:11,338
Daddy's here!

488
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,839
You want
to see something?

489
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,844
I'm going to bring
down the wrath of god on you!

490
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:19,313
Oh.

491
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:23,384
Wait one second, this is
my favorite bit right here.

492
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:25,619
Oh bang, that hurt.

493
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:29,184
You know you're all
over the web, right?

494
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:30,560
Whoa, whoa,
what's that?

495
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:31,559
Ah.

496
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:33,924
Mr. caterpillar.

497
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:37,631
But mr. octopus is
at your apartment, right?

498
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,267
Mr. caterpillar is better
than mr. octopus,

499
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:41,402
More legs.

500
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:42,863
Jayden will be fine
with it.

501
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,471
Did you
set up her room?

502
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:45,969
Yes, molly.

503
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,274
Does it have a bed
in it?

504
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:49,209
Oh...

505
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:50,811
I knew i forgot something.

506
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:52,208
I'm kidding.

507
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,745
Oh, do you think
this is funny?

508
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:55,581
It happens
to be very important

509
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:57,282
That jayden feel good
about your apartment.

510
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:58,316
That she feels safe.

511
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,920
And at home,
just like she does--

512
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:07,561
Bitch!

513
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:10,731
You're worried
about jayden at my house?

514
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,595
At least we don't have
drive-by cupcakings.

515
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:14,533
Oh don't try and
turn this around on me.

516
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,107
Why are you yelling?

517
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:22,643
Um...

518
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:28,446
Sometimes your father's tone
sounds like yelling, honey.

519
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,184
It'syourtone.

520
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:33,253
Um...

521
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:36,588
We were just uh...

522
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,192
Um, we were just talking
about mr. octopus.

523
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:42,261
Which daddy can't find
right now,

524
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:44,098
Because of the move.

525
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,765
So if you think that you're not
going to be able to sleep

526
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,734
At daddy's new house
without him,

527
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:50,668
It's-- it's totally fine.

528
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:51,704
We understand.

529
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:53,673
You're not fun anymore.

530
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,008
I want to go to daddy's.

531
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:05,849
Okay, okay.

532
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:07,854
Hop in.

533
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:12,459
Seatbelt.

534
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,244
We'll see you
sunday night.

535
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:35,447
Molly kagan,

536
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,334
Mother of the year.

537
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,077
The offer's
still open.

538
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:07,314
Take me to rehab.

539
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,889
So i got a pain reliever
for my sore shoulder.

540
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,323
For band practice...

541
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,724
Need another one
for headaches.

542
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,524
Different pains,
different pain relievers.

543
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,996
But now advil is my every pain reliever.

544
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,730
Works wherever i hurt.

545
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:43,915
I'm all advil.

546
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,119
The new coffee-mate
world cafe collection.

547
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:54,925
Italian sweet creme,

548
00:28:57,462 --> 00:28:57,762
Tiramisu,

549
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,003
Hazelnut biscotti.

550
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:05,671
Three delicious flavors

551
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,143
That'll make any moment
magnifico,so stir it up

552
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,896
With new flavors from coffee's
perfect mate.

553
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:46,132
In malibu there are more homes
for rehab

554
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:47,466
Than there are hotel rooms.

555
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:49,500
And they have better food,

556
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:51,002
Incredible views

557
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,739
And spa treatments
to die for.

558
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:56,376
Just don't expect too much
from the mini bar.

559
00:31:57,778 --> 00:31:58,411
Maybe you and pappy

560
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:00,106
Should go to counseling.

561
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,144
Why?

562
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:03,011
So i can hear more
about his feelings?

563
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:06,386
I'm sick
of his feelings.

564
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,917
Don't do anything
you'll regret.

565
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,999
Just something
he'll regret.

566
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,191
Well take a look around.

567
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:16,560
I've got to go
and search david shay's room

568
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,162
I haven't found
any contraband yet,

569
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,681
But um, he's got
the best damn dark chocolate.

570
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:41,585
You got a light?

571
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:44,021
Oh... no, sorry.

572
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:45,923
I don't smoke.

573
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:48,127
So uh, it can't
be coke or diet pills.

574
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:51,461
You don't look puffy enough
for an alchy.

575
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,196
I'm guessing

576
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,500
Valium?
painkillers?

577
00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:58,371
No, i don't really have
that kind of problem.

578
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:02,539
That's not going to go down well
at the meetings.

579
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:03,975
No, really.

580
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,544
I'm just here avoiding
my life.

581
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,113
Valium's a lot cheaper.

582
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,546
I'll rember that
for next time.

583
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:12,114
This is the one place
you can't smoke.

584
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:15,922
Which i suppose
explains the smoking.

585
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:18,993
Oh wow.

586
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:20,393
I've always wanted
to do that

587
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,525
Ever since
i saw grease two.

588
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,066
Yeah, that's almost
worth smoking for.

589
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,233
Hello, julie!

590
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:34,572
Woo!

591
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:36,008
Come have a splash.

592
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:38,643
Sorry, have to change the
batteries on your toothbrush.

593
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:41,945
What does it take?

594
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,413
Double as?

595
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,014
You're too clever
by half, julie.

596
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:49,285
Whoo!

597
00:33:57,896 --> 00:33:58,163
Yee-haw.

598
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,801
It's the last time.
i mean it.

599
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:07,236
Come on, jayden.

600
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,569
I wanna talk to you
about a little something

601
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,504
I got going,
called "blood canal".

602
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:11,644
It's going
to be huge.

603
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:13,774
I hear
it's unreleaseable.

604
00:34:14,712 --> 00:34:15,079
No, it uh--

605
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:16,446
We're reshooting
a few key scenes,

606
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,678
We're adding
an evil american president

607
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,985
For foreign.
oh, great.

608
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:22,316
But those-those scenes could use
the zach mcneill touch,

609
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,456
If you know
what i mean, huh?

610
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,654
Well, i'm really
into my novel right now.

611
00:34:26,655 --> 00:34:26,822
O- oh.

612
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:27,891
No offense, zach,
but a novel

613
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,358
Is pretty much a speck
on a fly

614
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:31,664
On a piece of crap
up an elephants ass.

615
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:33,263
None taken.

616
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:34,400
Daddy, daddy.

617
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:36,302
That boy called me pig ears.

618
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,334
And he told me i grew up
on a farm.

619
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:39,633
Well you tell him,

620
00:34:40,304 --> 00:34:41,737
That he's
a hyundai-driving loser,

621
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,376
Who's going to end
up sweltering

622
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,978
In some hell-hole in the valley,
north of ventura.

623
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:47,142
North of...?

624
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:48,714
Ah, just tell him
to go blow it out of his butt.

625
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:49,843
I can do that.

626
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,483
Good girl.

627
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,253
I'm such a better father
since the divorce.

628
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,325
The only five-star chef
who can cook without booze.

629
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:04,429
I need you out
of the pool.

630
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:05,829
God, i hate that man.

631
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,997
Can i come back next
visitor's day?

632
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,099
I'm not going
to be here.

633
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:10,335
I'm not a real addict,
remember?

634
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:12,269
You've sworn off men,
and yet your fingers

635
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:14,238
Are just tingling
to call up zach

636
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,972
And see how his head is,
placing you smack dab

637
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,474
Into the danger zone
of broken resolve.

638
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:18,709
Am i wrong?

639
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,278
I think she needs
at least another week here.

640
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:21,713
I think the best thing
for my resolve

641
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:24,448
Is watching my friends'
screwed up sex lives.

642
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,117
I'm not screwed up
about sex; felix is.

643
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,786
You're screwing someone
who's screwed up about sex,

644
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:29,555
Which makes it screwed up
once removed.

645
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,490
And i'm going
to screw somebody

646
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,125
Because pappy's screwed
up about sex.

647
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,494
Which makes it screwed up
once removed

648
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:36,559
From the husband's side.
ha!

649
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:39,396
Out!

650
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,100
It is so dreary.

651
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,100
Why can't we just have therapy
in the pool?

652
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:46,169
It's equine therapy.

653
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:47,604
Just get out.

654
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,607
Give me a laugh
and i'll think about it.

655
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,678
At least the horse's
won't bore you

656
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:54,243
With stories of how they woke up
in their own vomit.

657
00:35:59,451 --> 00:35:59,785
Excellent.

658
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,453
Head to your room to change,
and i'm right behind you.

659
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:08,060
17 days
and counting,

660
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:09,428
Then he'll be gone,

661
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:15,133
Gone from my life
forever.

662
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,567
Never to be thought of
again,

663
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,268
Until i read about how
he's offended another minority.

664
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:20,905
Never to hear
his odious accent

665
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,742
Or see him splashing
away in the pool.

666
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:30,481
He's perfect.

667
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:33,452
He's mentally repellant
yet physically attractive.

668
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:36,756
He'll shag anything.

669
00:36:37,925 --> 00:36:39,992
I certainly fall
withinthatrange.

670
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,595
And when
it's over he'll go out,

671
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,999
Take up drinking again
and he won't rember a thing.

672
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:50,097
God, i hope i didn't wear
my granny pants.

673
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:51,304
Wait, joan.

674
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,471
No, i know what you're
going to say,

675
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:54,607
He's a disgusting homophobe

676
00:36:54,617 --> 00:36:55,975
And i should have nothing
to do with him.

677
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,813
But that's exactly why
he's perfect.

678
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:08,354
I've got
to stop this.

679
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:09,451
It's her choice.

680
00:37:14,924 --> 00:37:15,491
It's a lousy one.

681
00:37:16,396 --> 00:37:16,996
Oh, what a relief.

682
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,127
I lost him.

683
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:19,460
Well you're a woman
on a mission.

684
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,031
Unfortunately,
it's a misguided one--

685
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:22,702
Like vietnam misguided.

686
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:26,301
I'm calling pappy's
bluff.

687
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,471
Is that what this
is about?

688
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:29,970
Yes.

689
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:33,608
No.

690
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:36,912
I'll do you.

691
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:39,083
I want to make mad,

692
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:42,221
Passionate, heterosexual
love on you.

693
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,354
But you're
as gay as a balloon.

694
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,522
Well i did it once
in high school,

695
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:48,724
And i don't remember
any complaints.

696
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:49,857
Now get undressed,
young lady.

697
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:54,029
Because rodney
is taking you to heaven.

698
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:56,568
All right, rodney.

699
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,836
If anyone can take the air out
of your balloon,

700
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:03,309
It's joan mcallister.

701
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:05,845
Should we get
a room or--

702
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:09,682
You know what straight women say
about men like you?

703
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,480
No.

704
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,250
It's such a shame.

705
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:17,353
So drop those boxers

706
00:38:26,396 --> 00:38:27,096
And let's make magic.

707
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:29,435
You must really hate
david shay.

708
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:32,198
Why should he be rewarded
for being a bigot?

709
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:34,768
Rewarded,
that's sweet.

710
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:37,107
Don't worry.
you're safe.

711
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:39,072
Pappy said not to sleep
with someone

712
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:43,014
I might fall
in love with.

713
00:38:46,748 --> 00:38:49,015
And i'm crossing david shay
off the list.

714
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:52,218
Okay, if-- you haven't
changed my mind.

715
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,657
All right,
you know what?

716
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,659
Just forget it really--
just--

717
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,226
So i guess we're
on the same schedule

718
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:00,866
With our kids.

719
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:02,601
It's usually not my weekend
with skylar,

720
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,737
But the ex wanted
to go to cabo

721
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:06,598
With her
new boyfriend jeff.

722
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,240
Ah.

723
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,869
Boyfriends really screw up
the schedule, you know?

724
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,077
Yeah.

725
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:13,145
You could bang out these pages
at starbucks--

726
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:14,480
Not doing it.

727
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:16,982
It's a bitch
when the wife dates,

728
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,150
Isn't it?

729
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:19,747
Molly date much?

730
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,648
Uh, there was
this homeless guy once.

731
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:22,755
You sure--
yeah--

732
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:23,988
Homeless guy?

733
00:39:24,888 --> 00:39:25,721
Blow it out of your butt.

734
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,856
And don't come around
anymore.

735
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:28,923
Everyone hates you.

736
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:31,864
That's my girl.

737
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:34,461
I've never seen any kid take
on donny spielberg before.

738
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:37,735
Donny who?

739
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:44,606
Spielberg's nephew.

740
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:45,975
No, no, no, no, no.

741
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:47,509
Jayden, out, out, out.

742
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:48,743
Why?
uh, be--

743
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,842
Do you know who
that was?

744
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,283
Come on,
out, out, out.

745
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:52,481
You're lying.
it's okay, we'll be back.

746
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:53,482
All right.

747
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:55,920
I want
to ride the horse.

748
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:58,824
I guess he didn't read
the brochure.

749
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,926
Equine therapy isn't
about riding;

750
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:04,294
It's about communicating
with your horse.

751
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,299
It's some nonsense
about basic equestrian

752
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:09,435
Ground skills,
whatever those are.

753
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:11,804
Bringing to light patterns
in our lives,

754
00:40:12,672 --> 00:40:13,305
Whatever those are.

755
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:14,840
And then all sorts
of deep,

756
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,442
Meaningful things
will happen.

757
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:18,142
Whatever they are.

758
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:19,545
What a crock of crap.

759
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:22,412
Well said.

760
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,945
Wow, you're pretty good
at that stuff.

761
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:28,217
Did you grow up
around horses?

762
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:29,419
Oh, i'm-- i'm sorry,
i didn't mean--

763
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:30,548
You want to try it?

764
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:32,551
Me?
oh, no, no.

765
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,123
I'm just
an observer.

766
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:35,694
Chicken.

767
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,862
She is really
shut down.

768
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,833
Why don't you try
lifting his hoof.

769
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,966
Yes, honey,
give it a try.

770
00:40:45,536 --> 00:40:47,803
Yeah, don't you want
your patterns revealed?

771
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:55,573
Okay.

772
00:40:57,216 --> 00:40:57,382
Okay.

773
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,051
Clear your mind
and lift it up.

774
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:03,581
It's not moving.
i wonder what that means.

775
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:06,889
Okay.
come on.

776
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:08,991
Okay, lift your paw
for ma.

777
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:10,022
It's a hoof.

778
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:11,996
Oh, right.
hoof.

779
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,573
I'm more of a dog person.

780
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:16,932
I don't have much experience
with, um, horses.

781
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,535
That's okay.
it's not about the horse.

782
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:28,908
Okay, obviously the horse
is tired.

783
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:30,180
He's been
lifting his leg all day.

784
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:34,384
Is it the horse
or is it your life?

785
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:37,589
I'm pretty sure
it's the horse.

786
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,958
The horse isn't stopping you
from anything.

787
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:41,558
You're stopping you.

788
00:41:44,394 --> 00:41:44,894
Think about it.

789
00:41:47,695 --> 00:41:48,195
Think about it.

790
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:49,599
Hate you.

791
00:41:58,075 --> 00:41:58,509
Hate you too.

792
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:03,379
Okay, we can do this.

793
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:16,559
Okay.

794
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:34,910
Okay, baby.

795
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:35,976
Kids are resilient.

796
00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:38,016
Divorce builds
character.

797
00:42:41,483 --> 00:42:43,016
I never
really apologized.

798
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:45,357
Cupcakes make
everything better.

799
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:57,703
I put some
in my boobs.

800
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:00,472
I'd like
to screw all night

801
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:02,503
And then vacuum.

802
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:21,055
I am so
getting you fired.

803
00:43:54,524 --> 00:43:55,258
Your worst symptoms...

804
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:56,461
Sinus pressure,

805
00:43:57,628 --> 00:43:58,494
Nasal congestion and pain.

806
00:43:58,504 --> 00:43:59,963
You can suffer
through them...

807
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,732
Or you can power
through them.

808
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:04,199
With advil cold & sinus.

809
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,537
It combines
2 super powers--

810
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,740
The power of advil...

811
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:11,042
Plus a strong decongestant...

812
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,408
In a power through formula...

813
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:14,244
You can get
at the pharmacy counter.

814
00:44:14,313 --> 00:44:16,780
So don't suffer through
your sinus symptoms...

815
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:18,015
Power through them.

816
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:19,985
With advil cold & sinus.

817
00:44:20,885 --> 00:44:21,218
Ask for it

818
00:44:25,257 --> 00:44:26,057
At the pharmacy counter.

819
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,380
There are some things
money can't buy.

820
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,515
For everything else there's
credit or debit mastercard.

821
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,340
Fan of the game, wherever
there's a game.

822
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:04,012
If i can give birth
without an epidural,

823
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,751
I can get
that friggin' hoof up.

824
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:08,353
Hi.

825
00:47:09,956 --> 00:47:11,756
Hey, there.
it's me again.

826
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:14,592
Hey, look,
i know--

827
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:16,700
I know that we had
some issues before.

828
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:22,662
Muchacha.

829
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:26,599
Oh, muchacho...
sorry.

830
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:28,502
How about--

831
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:31,001
How about you lift
that leg for me now?

832
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:35,009
Huh?

833
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:39,848
Almighty.

834
00:47:41,082 --> 00:47:41,782
Uh, pinch his tendon.

835
00:47:42,288 --> 00:47:43,755
The leg will come
right up.

836
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:45,751
Do you have horses
at home?

837
00:47:46,587 --> 00:47:46,954
Which home?

838
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,961
Mom and bill's
or dad and sheila's?

839
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,597
Divorce is tough.

840
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:56,828
I know.

841
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,100
Hey...

842
00:47:59,971 --> 00:48:00,438
Is this yours?

843
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:01,734
Yes.

844
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:03,904
Oh, i'm sorry.
i didn't see anything.

845
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:06,174
Good.

846
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:07,675
Is that why you came
out here?

847
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:09,247
Because of something
in the letter?

848
00:48:09,317 --> 00:48:12,417
I came out here because i like
horses a lot better than people.

849
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,183
They don't ask irritating
questions, for one.

850
00:48:16,152 --> 00:48:16,486
Okay look,

851
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:18,017
I'm really, really sorry.

852
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,288
I did see some
of the letter.

853
00:48:21,756 --> 00:48:22,456
Why are you so upset?

854
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,257
About the lyrics
to "oklahoma"?

855
00:48:25,657 --> 00:48:26,091
I mean it's--

856
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:28,032
It's kind
of a fun song.

857
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,400
Do you really want
to know?

858
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:32,437
My mom sent them
to me.

859
00:48:32,447 --> 00:48:34,272
Because instead
of telling people

860
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:38,209
That i'm drying up
in some rehab,

861
00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:41,612
She told everyone that i'm away
at musical theatre camp.

862
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,477
I have to learn the song
before i go home.

863
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:47,079
Oh, wow.

864
00:48:47,486 --> 00:48:48,719
I didn't see
that coming.

865
00:48:48,729 --> 00:48:50,122
So do you want
to say something now

866
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:51,656
About how she's just trying
to protect me,

867
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:52,916
Or how she
really loves me?

868
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:54,253
No.

869
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,993
She sounds
like an asshole.

870
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:05,000
Sometimes perspective
is the most sobering

871
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:09,372
Treatment of all.

872
00:49:09,872 --> 00:49:10,572
Okay good, he's here.

873
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:11,873
You see him?

874
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:12,909
Right there.

875
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,045
You remember what to say?

876
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:15,780
Why do i have
to apologize, daddy?

877
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:17,045
He started it.
i know,

878
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,378
But sometimes daddies
make mistakes,

879
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:19,980
And this was one
of them.

880
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,453
Hey.

881
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:24,889
I'm sorry i told you
to blow it out of your butt.

882
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:26,357
There we go,
okay.

883
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:27,959
Everybody's happy?
everybody's friends.

884
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:29,127
All right?

885
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:30,328
No need
to ever mention it again.

886
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:31,761
Like at the family seder
or anything.

887
00:49:33,227 --> 00:49:35,827
Don't worry, we don't talk
about losers at passover.

888
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:44,135
Pig ears!

889
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,781
You okay? yeah, thanks daddy.

890
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:54,519
Mm-hmm?

891
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:55,887
You're leaving.

892
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:59,424
But you haven't danced
with your inner child

893
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:01,658
In the serenity tent.

894
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,926
This place is for people
with bigger problems

895
00:50:04,097 --> 00:50:05,997
Than being banned
from snow day.

896
00:50:06,729 --> 00:50:08,796
So you're ready
to get back in the game.

897
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:11,868
Yeah.

898
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:13,768
I learned from my horse

899
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:16,574
That i need
to face the music.

900
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:18,004
Mm-hmm.

901
00:50:18,604 --> 00:50:20,004
I also learned
from my horse

902
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:22,708
That i've
got it pretty good.

903
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:24,845
And i learned
from my horse

904
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,985
That i need to be
with my daughter right now.

905
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:29,647
Did you have sparky?

906
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:32,387
You know,
you did it again.

907
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:36,056
You took care of me.

908
00:50:37,926 --> 00:50:38,026
Oh.

909
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:41,064
I wish i could
do something for you.

910
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:42,366
But i don't know what.

911
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:44,101
Nobody does.

912
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,530
There is no group
for this particular problem.

913
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:47,734
Hey.

914
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,069
I'm here for you.

915
00:50:52,274 --> 00:50:52,874
Whatever you need.

916
00:50:52,912 --> 00:50:54,445
And you do
what you need to do.

917
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:56,147
I don't even know
if i can.

918
00:50:57,949 --> 00:50:58,616
What are my options?

919
00:50:58,912 --> 00:51:01,779
We already know i'm not big
with the 80 and over set.

920
00:51:04,149 --> 00:51:04,349
You...

921
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:07,825
Are a very
desirable woman.

922
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:08,960
Aw.

923
00:51:11,263 --> 00:51:11,696
Not you, too.

924
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:19,737
Come on.

925
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:21,772
Hey,
do me a favor.

926
00:51:21,782 --> 00:51:24,405
That girl desperately needs
someone to talk to.

927
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:26,974
Oh, god.

928
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:28,145
You know how i feel
about caring.

929
00:51:30,013 --> 00:51:30,246
I know.

930
00:51:31,948 --> 00:51:34,548
But unfortunately for you,
you're really good at it.

931
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:35,783
Joan...

932
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,816
Great job
covering david shay.

933
00:51:39,484 --> 00:51:41,318
Okay, gary,
you've got your sarcastic voice.

934
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:42,960
Why?

935
00:51:43,795 --> 00:51:44,395
He just went awol.

936
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,097
Someone left the barn door open
last night

937
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:47,694
And one of the horses
is gone.

938
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:50,062
Oh, i gotta deal
with this.

939
00:52:04,717 --> 00:52:06,350
Who the hell
left the barn door open?

940
00:52:06,386 --> 00:52:08,919
I've got to go pick up
my daughter.

941
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:10,683
At her dad's.

942
00:52:11,223 --> 00:52:12,957
Don't worry,
she won't turn out like me.

943
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:22,765
You're not done yet.

944
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:30,270
Bye.

945
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:32,943
Mommy!

946
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:34,678
Hey!

947
00:52:36,714 --> 00:52:36,981
Oh gosh.

948
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,113
How are you, honey?

949
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:41,383
Daddy found mr. octopus

950
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,686
And he let me watch "the
40-year-old virgin"

951
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:46,090
And he threw a spielberg
in the pool.

952
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:49,658
You threw a spielberg
in the pool?

953
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:52,729
Yeah, the kid
was mean to her.

954
00:52:57,637 --> 00:53:00,004
I'm trying not to think
about it, though.

955
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:01,038
Whoa, whoa.

956
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:02,406
Uh, what're you doing?

957
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:05,941
Confusing messages.

958
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:07,645
You can lead a horse
to rehab,

959
00:53:07,655 --> 00:53:09,307
But you won't
let a man drink.

960
00:53:10,247 --> 00:53:11,413
Very good.
now get off...

961
00:53:11,423 --> 00:53:13,147
'cause this turf's going
to ruin my heels.

962
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:14,614
Make me.

963
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:19,454
I'd rather not.

964
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:20,555
You know, the upside
of not having children

965
00:53:20,689 --> 00:53:22,622
Was avoiding this kind
of a tantrum.

966
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:26,931
Oh!
oh!

967
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:29,967
You know...

968
00:53:38,209 --> 00:53:40,275
I've paid extra
to have you all to myself.

969
00:53:43,716 --> 00:53:45,616
You may have been
shortchanged.

970
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:50,454
I don't think so.

971
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:51,789
All right.

972
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:56,954
Here we go.

973
00:53:58,963 --> 00:53:59,730
Honey,
what's up?

974
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:01,365
I don't want to go.

975
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,167
But you were looking
forward to it.

976
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:05,500
What if people start yelling
at you again?

977
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,234
We'll get through it.
we've got each other.

978
00:54:09,107 --> 00:54:10,507
Jayden you have
two parents

979
00:54:13,076 --> 00:54:14,076
That love you unconditionally.

980
00:54:14,812 --> 00:54:17,045
And you can always come
to us no matter what

981
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:19,345
And we'll work it out.

982
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:22,483
But right now,
no running away.

983
00:54:23,154 --> 00:54:23,854
We've got to face it.

984
00:54:24,956 --> 00:54:25,623
You have to face it.

985
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:31,057
I didn't write a diary
with mean things in it.

986
00:54:32,392 --> 00:54:32,925
Not a bad point.

987
00:54:34,596 --> 00:54:35,029
You're right.

988
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:37,330
I've got to face it.

989
00:55:48,072 --> 00:55:48,639
Will you help me?

990
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:49,873
The chick
with the doggy boobs--

991
00:55:50,538 --> 00:55:52,205
She's got
a pretty good arm.

992
00:55:52,977 --> 00:55:53,510
How's your head?

993
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,839
Got the whole executive
branch memorized.

994
00:55:57,348 --> 00:55:57,448
Mm.

995
00:55:57,742 --> 00:55:58,508
You want me to peg her?

996
00:55:59,444 --> 00:55:59,610
Nope.

997
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:02,215
I'm cool.

998
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,320
Cover me.

999
00:56:11,294 --> 00:56:11,394
