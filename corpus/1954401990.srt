What's up?

00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,053
We got a new rookie.

22
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,922
Mike cherry,
in the yellow hat.

23
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,724
Boss: Gabriel, johnny,
get over here.

24
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,959
How's bobby doin'?

25
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,562
Uh, not so good, johnny.
He's still in the hospital.

26
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,896
They haven't figured out
what's wrong with him?

27
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,897
They don't know, man.

28
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,066
Whatever it is
hit him hard and fast.

29
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,835
Don't worry.
He's a tough kid.

30
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,236
They can work miracles
these days.

31
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,704
Yeah, miracles
are expensive.

Your widow gets

All you got to
remember, kid,

38
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,187
Is never step back
and admire your work.

39
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,223
Whoa!

You want to be funny,
chief? Laugh at this.

43
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,332
There's a $500
safety infraction

44
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,767
Out of your check.

45
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,537
Now you wanna earn
your wage or not?

Take a cue from this guy.

00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,441
3 years on the job,
not one sick day.

00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,776
I never get sick.

I don't care if you do,
gabriel.

00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,446
I just care
that you show up.

51
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,081
There's something wrong
with the crane.

52
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,484
You're gonna be the lucky
guys who get to go fix it.

53
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,119
As for you...

54
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,454
Wind shear's come loose.

55
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,789
Get out there
and bolt it down.

56
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,824
The average guy
on this site

57
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,192
Can do that
in 10 minutes.

58
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,461
I'm givin' you
20 minutes

59
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,229
'cause I'm such
a nice guy.

60
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,964
I'll do it.

61
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:13,999
He's not ready.

62
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,700
[wind whistling]

63
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,335
Gabriel,
you know the rules.

64
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,503
You work the minute
you get here,

65
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,604
Or you don't work.

66
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,939
Now get moving,

67
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,875
Or you'll find yourself
on the unemployment line.

68
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,844
Oh, that's right.

69
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,280
Both: There is no
unemployment line.

70
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,348
He has no safety
at all.

71
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,152
He's gonna go.

72
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,654
Tie me off.

73
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,122
Help me!

74
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,557
Hang on, mike!

75
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,691
Aah!

76
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,465
Hold on to me.

77
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,100
Uhh!

78
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,672
I gotcha.
Hold on to me.

79
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,808
I'm gonna swing you
towards the building.

80
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,579
Uhh!

81
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,013
Aah!

82
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,260
Son of a bitch.

83
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,332
Johnny!
You all right?!

84
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,100
No!

85
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,902
Can you swing
onto that cab?

86
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,341
I need to be
a little--

87
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:38,049
Get out of there,
johnny!

88
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,851
Hurry up!
It's gonna go!

89
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,119
I can't.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
Are you ok?

91
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,335
Go get johnny.

92
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,908
Oh, man.

93
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,597
You almost killed him.

94
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,799
Get out there
and bolt it down.

95
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,039
You're fired.

96
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,643
You got a problem
with that?

97
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,146
Take it up
with the union.

98
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,682
Oh, I forgot.
There is no union.

99
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,120
Tell me again
that I'm fired.

100
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,526
Tell me again
that I'm fired.

101
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,035
One last thing.

102
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,771
[coughing]

103
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,916
Hey, dad.

104
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,985
Hey, bobby.

105
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,421
How you feelin'?

106
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,956
Like a freak.

107
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,064
So when did
all this happen?

108
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:41,132
This afternoon,
I guess.

109
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,367
I was asleep.

110
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,735
Mm-hmm.

111
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,038
What happened to you?

112
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,109
Well, I figured if I'm
comin' to the hospital,

113
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,244
I might as well
look the part.

114
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,580
Huh?

115
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,248
You all right, dad?

116
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,650
We're gonna get you
out of here

117
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,518
As soon
as possible, bobby.

118
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,289
Promise.

119
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:09,127
No, I mean,
will<i> you</i> be all right...

120
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,995
[whispering]
if something should happen?

121
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,497
Hey.

122
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,069
Check this out.

123
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,339
Ohh.

124
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,509
Cray ii gamer goggles.

125
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,579
With 256 gigabytes of
gaming power because...

126
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,348
Reality has
no reset button.

127
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,950
[sighs]

128
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,785
What?

129
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,186
They're too expensive.

130
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,021
Gimme a break, will ya?

131
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,756
I worked
a little overtime.

132
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,560
Oh, man,
this is primo.

133
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,995
Evening, mr. Gabriel.

134
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,163
Hey, doc.

135
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,505
Whoa.

136
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,839
Hehhh.

137
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,341
Could I see you
for a moment?

138
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,544
Sure.

139
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,449
I'll be right back, ok?

140
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,684
Bye, dad.

141
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,553
Whoa.

142
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,958
What, uh,
was that readout?

143
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,693
According to
our diagnostic equipment,

144
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,129
Your son has
a white blood cell count

145
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,899
5 times above what
is humanly possible.

146
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,333
It's purely an equipment
malfunction.

147
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,769
What are you talking about,
the equipment's malfunctioning?

148
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,005
Well, it's not relevant.

149
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,240
We know what's wrong
with bobby.

150
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,877
Your son has contracted
ralph virus.

151
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,747
Ralph virus?

152
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,550
How's that possible?

153
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,418
Lifecorps wiped out
ralph virus.

154
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,420
We certainly thought
it was controlled.

155
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,489
There hasn't been
a new case reported

156
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,823
In over 2 years,

157
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,760
But your son shows all
the symptoms of the virus

158
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,029
Just before
it goes critical.

159
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,063
And the blood work,

160
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,065
Which I performed
personally, confirms it.

161
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,733
Then cure him.

162
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,902
The vaccine is
prohibitively expensive.

163
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,939
I give you guys everything
I make. Everything.

164
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,576
I don't set the prices
here, mr. Gabriel.

165
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,945
I only know that
the billing department

166
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,379
Informs me that
your son's account

167
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,881
Is seriously past due,

168
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,683
And unless you settle
that account,

169
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,687
I won't be allowed to
administer the vaccine.

170
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,522
Your son's not got long

171
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,724
Before his body
begins to shut down.

172
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,994
After that, the vaccine
will have no effect.

173
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,397
How long have I got?

174
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,600
Maybe 12 hours.

175
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,302
A day at the most.

176
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,909
Man: Nurse!

177
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,077

Man's voice: Lifecorps.

180
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,650
Hi.

181
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,052
Hi.

182
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,737
[clears throat]

183
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,374
I wouldn't
if I were you.

184
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,378
You're not me.

185
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,747
Ha. Suit yourself.

186
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,948
[ding]

187
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,653
Everyone wants
to cash in...

188
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,422
Nobody wants to pay.

189
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,434
See you 'round.

190
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,507
Mr. Gabriel.

191
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,222
Mr. Gabriel,
I'm honored.

192
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,057
You've got one hour
to process me.

193
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,225
That's very amusing.

194
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,428
This exam, I'm afraid,
takes some time.

195
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,429
It's very involved--

196
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,998
One hour, or I walk.

197
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:50,635
Well, then, we best get
started, hadn't we?

198
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,546
Have you run these tests
a second time?

199
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,580
Uh, not yet.

200
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,282
Lung scan complete.

201
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,983
Neurology report in.

202
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,491
Bergen: Prepare the subject
for final brain scan.

203
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,493
Nurse: 180. Steady.

204
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,861
Huh.

205
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,329
Extraordinary numbers,
doctor.

206
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,997
Would you look at that?

207
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,034
Helen: Mid-central's data
confirms our findings.

208
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,137
He's really quite
a specimen.

209
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,174
Vital organs, eyes, teeth
are of exceptionally high grade.

210
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,810
Blood, good to superior.

211
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,379
High counts on bone marrow
and pituitary.

212
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,682
The data shows he lost
his wife 6 years ago,

213
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,851
But there is no history
of depression,

214
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,586
And there's no inclination
towards suicide.

215
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,588
That doesn't mean
it isn't there.

216
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,256
One of the, uh, things

217
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,092
We haven't learned
to read, yet, is minds.

218
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,469
Ow!

219
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,470
There we go.

220
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,738
What was that?

221
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,006
Oh, it's vitamin
supplements.

222
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,576
C boosters, b-complex,
flu inhibitors, the works.

223
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,044
Even if you don't end up
signing with us,

224
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,980
You won't get a bug
all winter.

225
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,581
Don't ever stick me
with a needle again

226
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,749
And not tell me first.

227
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,451
Shh shh.
Relax, mr. Gabriel.

228
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,652
I understand.

229
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,921
Now, if you'll make your way out
to our waiting room,

230
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,625
One of our senior administrators
will complete formalities.

231
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,130
Mr. Gabriel,
dr. Helen steele.

232
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,232
I'm corporate officer
here at lifecorps.

233
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,634
You must be very
pleased to know

234
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,636
That you passed
our qualifying exam.

235
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,437
In fact, our staff
was very impressed.

236
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,438
Where's my money?

237
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,507
Sit down, please.

238
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,744
Mr. Gabriel, before we
go any further,

239
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,245
Lifecorps
wants to be certain

240
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,014
That you understand
the gravity

241
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,349
Of the commitment
you're about to make.

242
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,450
Oh, I understand.

243
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,487
You're buying my body,
you're giving me a year,

244
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,455
Then you carve me up
for parts.

245
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,224
That's about right,
isn't it?

246
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,127
Then we can safely say
that you grasp

247
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,129
The essential nature
of the contract.

248
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,264
Yeah. Look, I don't have
a lot of time to chat.

249
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,899
These are the terms

250
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,402
Of your contract
with lifecorps.

251
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,404
$300,000 for one year

252
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,439
To dispose of
as you wish.

253
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,774
For exactly one year.

254
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,011
On September 10th at,
uh, 20 minutes to 8:00,

255
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,346
When the contract
expires,

256
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,081
You will be picked up

257
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,284
By one of our
corporate limousines.

258
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,263
Where's my money?

259
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,332
There's one more thing.

260
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,100
Lifecorps requires
that you be fitted

261
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,736
With one of our
resource bracelets.

262
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,773
[beep]

263
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,178
In case I run.

264
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:50,581
You made a commitment,
mr. Gabriel.

265
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,616
We expect you
to honor it.

266
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,785
[thundering]

267
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,544
Hey!

268
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,045
[thunder]

269
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,921
Where is my son?

270
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,727
The virus came on faster
than we anticipated.

271
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,398
I'm sorry, mr. Gabriel.

272
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,834
Where is he?

273
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,904
Your son's body
had to be destroyed.

274
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,909
Where's my son?!
I want to see him!

275
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,012
Nobody can, mr. Gabriel.
He's gone.

276
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,693
The vaccine.

277
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,361
What--what about
the vaccine?

278
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,263
They wouldn't
release it.

279
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,433
I tried,
but without payment--

280
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,601
I begged them.

281
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,571
Them?

282
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,905
Who them?

283
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,074
[thunder]

284
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,963
Excuse me.

285
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,297
Excuse me,
mr. Gabriel,

286
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,665
You're not permitted
past reception.

287
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,968
We didn't expect
to see you here so soon.

288
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:24,969
You can have
your money back.

289
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:25,970
I don't understand.

290
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,338
I'm givin' it back.
I don't want it.

291
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,507
I'm anton stofeles,

292
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,109
Chief medical officer
of lifecorps.

293
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,744
Why don't we talk in
my office, mr. Gabriel?

294
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,079
I can talk just as fine
right here.

295
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,149
It's only natural
for a new member

296
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,851
To experience a period
of adjustment.

297
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,919
I understand.

298
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,588
You don't understand
anything!

299
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,925
You and your people, you had
the power in your hands,

300
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,295
And you just stood by
and watched my son die.

301
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,763
What's he
talking about?

302
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,665
It was one of
dr. Elliot's cases.

303
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,933
I was just informed.

304
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,837
Did he also inform you that
my son could've been saved?

305
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,207
You think this justifies it?

306
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,710
You think this is worth
more than my son?

307
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,012
Well, it's not!

308
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,413
[people chattering
excitedly]

309
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,683
Your money stinks.

310
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,354
Uh, mr. Gabriel.

311
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:21,091
Anton: We do still
have a contract.

312
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,761
The hell you do.

313
00:24:23,828 --> 00:24:27,598
You just took my son.
You can't take me.

314
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,874
We'll have to get an early
retrieval order on him.

315
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,810
Was he trading his life
for his son's life?

316
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,512
There are no exceptions,
helen.

317
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,247
You heard what he said.

318
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,284
A public statement
to violate his contract.

319
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,422
Man's a flight risk.

320
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,898
We'll go
to judge hickey.

321
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,168
Helen...

322
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,772
Look at what he's done.

323
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,308
The man's dangerous.

324
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,029
As you can see,
your honor,

325
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,497
Lifecorps client
james gabriel

326
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,700
Has indicated willful intention
to violate his contract.

327
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,036
I can read,
mr. Strathmore.

328
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,638
Your honor, the nature
of my client's business

329
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,374
Is such that any court decision
establishing grounds

330
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,975
For rescinding
a lifecorps contract--

331
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,244
Would hurt
their bottom line.

332
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,612
Would do violence
to fundamental principles

333
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,414
Of contract law.

334
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,649
In a case like this,
counselor,

335
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,750
A company
might have grounds

336
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,019
For discretion
based on conscience.

337
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,789
Lifecorps business is
human body parts, your honor.

338
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,825
I don't believe they deal
in conscience...Yet.

339
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,727
Well, when they do,

340
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,063
Perhaps you can be
the first in line.

341
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,400
Well, I'll take it
under advisement.

342
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,735
As far as discretion,

343
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,237
Lifecorps takes great care

344
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,273
When choosing those
who provide its product...

345
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,677
And those who might need
to receive it.

346
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,320
What lifecorps is asking
of this court

347
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,921
Is power over
life and death.

348
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,525
Life and death are secondary,
your honor.

349
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,826
We merely want

350
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,662
What james gabriel's
contracted to give us.

351
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,886
Johnny: I've never seen
a lock like that.

352
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,954
What the hell's it made of?

353
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,624
Aw, forget it, johnny.
It won't come off.

354
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,659
Can't see you wearin' that
for a year.

355
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,828
Year's a long time, man.

356
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,941
He was all I had, man.

357
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,244
He was a good kid.
Bobby.

358
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,179
Made a man out of me.

359
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,482
Had to be there for him.

360
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,084
Holdin' a job. Sheesh.

361
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:40,157
Pack his lunch.
Take him to school.

362
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,826
Gimme another hit
of that, would you?

363
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,134
You know,
when his mom died,

364
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,268
Everybody thought
I was nuts,

365
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,570
Not letting him
get adopted.

366
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,006
Who was I
to raise a kid?

367
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:00,210
A guy like me always
in some kind of trouble.

368
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,880
You did all right.

369
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,249
You were always
a standup guy.

370
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,452
You never turned your back
on no one.

371
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,255
I turned my back
on bobby.

372
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,758
I was a day late
and 300 grand short.

373
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,294
[knock on door]

374
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,295
Ruhhh.

375
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,230
[knock on door]

376
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,231
Go away.

377
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,533
[knock on door]

378
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,700
[johnny sighs]

379
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,303
[knock on door]

380
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,938
I said go away!

381
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:28,939
[knock on door]

382
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,508
Fool must be
hard of hearing.

383
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,746
Now, look...

384
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,448
Hi.

385
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,558
Aah!

386
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,027
[club music playing]

387
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,800
Got a cd coming out.

388
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,545
Uh, coffee, please.

389
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,846
You bet.

390
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,723
[beeping]

391
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:41,004
Man: No, you know,
I usually come here.

392
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,508
I like the crowd,
I like the ambiance.

393
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,843
Mind if I sit here?

394
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,547
It's a little cold
out there.

395
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,618
A little cold
in here, too.

396
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,454
Is that all
you're drinking?

397
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,064
What is it exactly
that you want?

398
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,632
You.

399
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,302
Give me a break, lady.

400
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,372
Thank you.

401
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,511
Yeah, well,
that is just so rude.

402
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,081
Gabriel!

403
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,091
[coughing]

404
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,795
Plasteel bullets.

405
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,664
High impact,
no penetration.

406
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,932
I bring you back dead,

407
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,601
Lifecorps will put
a contract out on me.

408
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,836
You're coming with me.

409
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,070
[coughs]

410
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:50,007
Maybe he'd rather
come with us.

411
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,644
[sighs]

412
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,612
That's a nice job,
alex.

413
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,980
My job, kilroy.

414
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,715
Oh, I'm truly sorry.

415
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,816
No, you're not.

416
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,918
You're right.
I'm not sorry!

417
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,588
In fact, I don't even
like you, see?

418
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,590
You take a lot of
business from me.

419
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,825
That's because you're
a lousy bounty hunter.

420
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,960
No, no, no, no, no.

421
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,929
A lousy bounty hunter
is a dead bounty hunter.

422
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,765
I'm simply patient.

423
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,167
No, you're just simple.

424
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,969
But maybe this
will register.

425
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,871
You can't have him.

426
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,047
Good-bye, alex.

427
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,686
Think about
who she is.

428
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,554
Think about who I am.

429
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,225
Now, think about
what happens

430
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,127
When I pull
this trigger.

431
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,531
That's a lot
to think about.

432
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,566
Uhh!

433
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,037
Damn it!

434
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,474
Son of a bitch!

435
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,476
What the hell's
going on here?

436
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,979
These guys are bounty
hunters, same as me.

437
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,482
Those guys in uniform
you got away from,

438
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,917
They're lifecorps
trackers.

439
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,385
What happened
to my year?

440
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,220
Well, that oughta
be obvious by now.

441
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,522
Lifecorps put out
an early retrieval on you.

442
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,690
Early retrieval?

443
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,992
That's the word
from lifecorps.

444
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,397
No live ammo.
No track darts.

445
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,232
Nothing in
the bloodstream.

446
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,934
They want you clean,
and they want you yesterday,

447
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:26,303
And I can't
figure out why.

448
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,305
Come on. We gotta
get you out of here.

449
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,677
Are you coming?

450
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,679
Or would you rather
wait around here

451
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,182
Until those 2 sleeping
beauties wake up?

452
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,784
[moaning]

453
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,597
Hold still, and don't ask me
why I'm doing this, runner.

454
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,298
My name isn't runner.

455
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,803
That doesn't change the fact
that that's what you are.

456
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,973
Come on, we got to
get out of here.

457
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,580
Don't you get it?

458
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,182
You're the prize.

459
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,553
You won't last
10 minutes out here.

460
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:22,893
You'll be safe here.

461
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,996
No one comes through that door
without an invitation.

462
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,831
Lights.

463
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,947
Are you a buddhist?

464
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,849
I used to be.

465
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,983
What happened?

466
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,786
This happened.
Any more questions?

467
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,322
Yeah. Why are you
helping me?

468
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,058
I'm obliged to protect you
'cause you saved my life.

469
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,195
You're a buddhist.

470
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,364
What's so funny?

471
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,366
All this.

472
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,068
I mean, my bounty hunter

473
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,137
Turns out to be
my bodyguard.

474
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,505
It's a little confusing.

475
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,309
Well, does the door
confuse you?

476
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,377
'cause you can walk
right back out it.

477
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,680
I don't keep
extra blankets.

478
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,849
That ought to
keep you warm.

479
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,351
Don't ask.

480
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,887
I didn't.

481
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,923
You can sleep over there.

482
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,560
I don't usually have men
sleep on my couch.

483
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,128
Where do they sleep?

484
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,965
Look, you want
the couch or not?

485
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,867
I don't mean to complain,
but as a rule,

486
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,402
I don't get blown through
too many windows.

487
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,472
So, tell me, aah,
is it bleedin' back there?

488
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,307
Unh.

Patient had a high

Condition inconsistent

502
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,313
Yeah.

503
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,714

diagnostic computer

504

On ward 9's
malfunctioning.

505
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,551
Did you do
some kind of a check--

506
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,785
I can't figure it out.

507
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,920
Just do a work-up

508
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,055
And let me know as soon
as possible. Thank you.

00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,432
Burke...

511
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,501
You got gabriel?

512
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,969
Not exactly.

513
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,170
What does that mean?

514
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:48,471
What the hell's
going on out there?

515
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,773
It means--

516
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,374
You lost gabriel.

517
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,410
I think he's
getting some help.

518
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,978
Who?

519
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,315
I have an idea.

520
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,617
Well, get the hell on it.
Bring in some trackers.

521
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:04,955
I don't tell you
how to chop 'em up.

522
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,124
You don't tell me
how to bag 'em. Yes?

523
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:10,894
Ow.

524
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,362
Hold still.

525
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,434
So why'd you sign
the lifecorps contract?

526
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,070
You don't seem the type.

527
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,406
I always wondered what
$300,000 looked like.

528
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,041
And it looks real good,

529
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,444
When you drop it
3 stories.

530
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,480
Really? Is that every
ironworker's dream?

531
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,648
Aah!

532
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,553
My kid was dyin', I couldn't
pay the hospital bills,

533
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,422
So I signed my life away.

534
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,993
Wanna hear more? It goes
downhill from there.

535
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,027
Yeah.

536
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,595
[sprays]

537
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,132
My son died.

538
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,039
And what about you?

539
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,576
You don't look like
the bounty hunter type.

540
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:02,112
I used to teach
martial arts.

541
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,413
It was spiritual.

542
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,716
It gave me purpose,
but it didn't feed me.

543
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,351
Then this guy I knew
said I had the skills

544
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,920
To make a bounty hunter.

545
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,856
Hard times make you
do hard things.

546
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,659
So, do you have
a picture of him?

547
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,161
Yeah.

548
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,739
Have you said
a prayer for him?

549
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,076
No, I guess I haven't.

550
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,917
Burke:
Proceed with caution.

551
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,852
Remember,
we want him breathing.

552
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,087
Understood?

553
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,122
Man: Understood.

554
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,129
[beeping]

555
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,751
Gabriel!

556
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:16,739
Get him!

557
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,023
Aah!

558
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,503
Aah!

559
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,347
I've killed him.

560
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,516
I've killed one
of burke's men.

561
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,688
Gabriel:
What are you doing?

562
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,855
Didn't you hear me?

563
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,691
I killed one
of burke's men.

564
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,825
I'm finished!

565
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,823
Uh, heh heh.

566
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,259
Let this be a little
lesson in leadership.

567
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,529
A simple demonstration,
cause and effect.

568
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,198
Who did this?

569
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:58,201
It's the girl.
In that apartment.

570
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:03,272
Ohh, alex.

571
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,109
Alex, alex, alex.

572
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,812
You stepped over the line.

573
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,087
Tell me about burke.

574
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,088
Why?

575
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,890
You mentioned burke.
Tell me about burke.

576
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,392
He's a contractor
for lifecorps.

577
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,726
Those were his men.

578
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,295
He's the guy who killed johnny.
He didn't give him a chance.

579
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,264
Then you know what
we're up against.

580
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,599
Do you know him?

581
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,501
Hey, you do know him,
don't you?

582
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,905
They honed in on you
like radar.

583
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,709
What are you doin'?

584
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,843
I'm looking
for something.

585
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,278
What?

586
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,356
Uh, there's
something here.

587
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,725
The vitamin shot.

588
00:44:55,793 --> 00:45:00,196
Great.
You've been implanted.

589
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,706
They're headed down
west 57th.

590
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:14,010
And you had better
deliver this time,

591
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:15,745
For your own sake.

592
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,019
They've gone public.

593
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,625
Hide your face.

594
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,302
You know someone in there
who can pop that implant?

595
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,770
If he's on duty.

596
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,986
He's here. Come on.

597
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,196
Burke: I'm sure I don't have
to remind you gentlemen--

598
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,132
Implants are not
like bracelets.

599
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,801
Scanners can tell you how
far you are from the target,

600
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,936
But they cannot indicate
what floor he is on.

601
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:17,206
Therefore, you will have
to think 3-dimensionally.

602
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,176
Pair off,
sweep the building,

603
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:24,313
And remember,
do not damage him...

604
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,983
Or her.

605
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,152
[footsteps]

606
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,856
What are you doing here?

607
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,208
This is illegal, mr. Gabriel.
You must know that.

608
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,043
That's the least
of our worries, doc.

609
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,811
Well, it's not
the least of mine.

610
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,980
[beeping]

611
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,349
It's an alpha transmitter

612
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,252
Inserted between the second
and third vertebrae.

613
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,389
Try to remove it yourself,
you sever the spinal cord.

614
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,408
I think we all want to get as
far away from this as possible.

615
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,077
What is so important
about you?

616
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,251
You took a risk, doc.
I appreciate that.

617
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,288
I wish I could've taken
a greater risk with your son.

618
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,224
Yeah.

619
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,960
Well, well, well.

620
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,229
One never knows
what one will find

621
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,431
When one is making
his rounds,

622
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,100
Does one, doctor?

623
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,770
Security. Here. Now.

624
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,941
Vitamin supplement.

625
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,377
You won't have a bug
all winter.

626
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,511
[coughing]

627
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,782
[panting]

628
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,951
You get this thing
out of me.

629
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,786
Get this thing
out of me!

630
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,625
[beeping]

631
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:22,298
You don't understand.
I'm a doctor. Tell them!

632
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,167
Look, let me talk to
your superior. Hold on.

633
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,770
Oh, god. Oh, jeez.

634
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,979
Gentlemen,
this is a mistake.

635
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:44,787
Aah!

636
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,871
Congratulations,
gentlemen.

637
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,172
Meet dr. Bergen.

638
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,974
He works for us.

639
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:09,178
At least he...
Used to work for us.

640
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,183
We've gotta get you
out of here.

641
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,217
What about you?

642
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,987
Look, I took a big chance
going after you.

643
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,089
I needed one big score
to get out of the business,

644
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,391
But I crossed
to the other side,

645
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,360
And burke's not gonna
let me cross back.

646
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:25,561
It's over for me.

647
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,203
Where are we going?

648
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,939
The price of freedom
just got higher.

649
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,731
Wait a minute.

650
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,234
That's your apartment.

651
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,802
This is nuts.

652
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,840
Look, all the money I have
is stashed in there.

653
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,376
So I either go in there
and get it,

654
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,044
Or I take you
to lifecorps

655
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,947
And hand you in
like a lotto ticket.

656
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,051
I'll give you 5 minutes.

657
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,881
You've done well
for yourself, alex.

658
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,254
You never were a very
good housekeeper.

659
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,423
Hmm.

660
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,029
Come on.

661
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,299
Where is he?

662
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,873
Why would you throw
everything away

663
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,209
For some runner?

664
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,079
Do you sleep with him?

665
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,705
You know,

666
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,041
That was careless,
killing that tracker.

667
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,643
[chiming]

668
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,013
Now I have to
bring you both in.

669
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,285
Planning on going
on a trip?

670
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,823
I mean...[scoffs]

671
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,358
Wherever you go,

672
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,426
You know I'll find you.

673
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,329
You already have.

674
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,832
Ah, mr. Gabriel,
there you are.

675
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,667
Turn around, burke.

676
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,507
That's my jacket.

677
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,509
I thought
it smelled bad.

678
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:05,481
So, uh, what's this about,
gabriel, hmm?

679
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,882
Your freedom?

680
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,418
Or is this about alex?

681
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:12,788
Is it about
your pathetic friend

682
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,191
Who was harboring
a known felon?

683
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,327
No.

684
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,330
Hmm. Well, what do you
expect me to do?

685
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,098
You want me to beg?

686
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:24,567
Get on your knees.

687
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:27,136
When pigs fly.

688
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,305
On your knees.

689
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:32,574
Go on.
Pull the trigger.

690
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,076
Do it.

691
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,884
This one's a big
disappointment, alex.

692
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,385
He can't do it.

693
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,221
I know guys just like this.

694
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,924
You don't know anything
about me.

695
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,492
James aaron gabriel.

696
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,761
Guy who can't hold a job
more than a month.

697
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:53,963
Court-martialed
out of the army

698
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,230
For assaulting
an officer.

699
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,499
Did 7 years hard labor
at leavenworth.

700
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,570
Paroled early for helping
a guard during a prison riot.

701
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,406
Stats: Dead wife,
dead kid, dead friend.

702
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,476
Current status...
Runner.

703
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,844
Miss anything?

704
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,145
Oh, yeah.

705
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:12,815
I've got the gun.

706
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,416
You want to blow
my head off, right?

707
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:19,888
I'm just gonna sit here
and make it easy on you.

708
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,824
I'm gonna count
to a hundred,

709
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,427
And when I get there,
I'm gonna blow your head off.

710
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,962
1...

711
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,698
2...

712
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,699
Gabriel, come on.

713
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,101
3...

714
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,870
In about 95 seconds.

715
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,138
Trackers.

716
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,940
5...6...

717
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:43,512
7...8...9...

718
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,664
It's just a jacket.

719
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,233
<i>Was</i> a jacket.

720
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,775
96...

721
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,410
97...98...

722
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,078
We just got
a report.

723
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,047
99...

724
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,218
Let me teach you

725
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,854
A little something

726
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,523
About etiquette.

727
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,392
Ohh!

728
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,263
Never interrupt me.

729
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,102
[sighs] ok.

730
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,105
I know a guy
who owes me a favor.

731
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,373
Come on.

732
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:47,843
[baby crying]

733
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,944
Shh shh shh.

734
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,045
Yes?

735
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,747
I'm sorry. It's
the wrong apartment.

736
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,016
It's ok, alma,
let him in.

737
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,350
Hey, mike.

738
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,753
Hey. You got famous.

739
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,421
Hi, I'm james.

740
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,457
This is a friend
of mine.

741
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,591
Hi.

742
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,362
Anton.

743
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,134
I have been talking
to the board.

744
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,268
The board.

745
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,903
Mm-hmm.

746
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,273
Without my consent.

747
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,242
Oh, I thought
you'd be relieved.

748
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,710
They want you to call off
this retrieval.

749
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,012
I mean, the public will
go mad when it finds out--

750
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,682
The public
wants a good show.

751
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,017
Do you think they're rooting
for james gabriel?

752
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,520
When he's captured,
he'll be yesterday's news.

753
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:35,457
Anton, a man risks his life
for his son's.

754
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,526
Now, we can't take that kind
of p.R. Damage.

755
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,161
I mean,
have you forgotten?

756
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,663
We are facing pending suicide
legislation in the senate.

757
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,233
Most of those old fools
are already on our books

758
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,301
Waiting for product.
They'll pass it.

759
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,838
I can't believe it.
Oh, god.

760
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,939
Helen, helen.

761
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,074
What?

762
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:56,345
You are the most brilliant
research scientist I have--

763
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,880
Have ever had.

764
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,182
I admire
your compassion.

765
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,117
And I tell you
that if I had known

766
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,685
About james gabriel's
son sooner,

767
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,454
I would have released
the vaccine,

768
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,123
But I can't change
what's happened.

769
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,593
If I allow gabriel
his freedom,

770
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,897
Scores, perhaps hundreds
of potential runners,

771
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,865
Men and women who are
confirmed as suicides,

772
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,767
Will petition
for theirs.

773
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,936
And then thousands
of people

774
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,139
Who are in need of
their organs will die.

775
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:31,280
Do you want that
on your conscience?

776
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,382
But, anton...

777
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,618
Anton...

778
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,822
You've been directed
to stop this.

779
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,758
I already have.

780
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:44,126
You have?

781
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,795
I've recalled burke,

782
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,298
And most of the trackers
are on their way in.

783
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,133
You're giving up on him?

784
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,570
Not at all.

785
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,648
[sighs]

786
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,984
Remember the good old days
when people had heat?

787
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,352
Heat costs money.

788
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,921
[laughs]

789
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,091
Coming from the guy that
gave away 300 grand.

790
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,427
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

791
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,166
Got any other
good ideas?

792
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,039
What do you think?

793
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,177
I wasn't thinking.

794
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:52,661
Ahh...

795
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,000
This has to wait.

796
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,242
We're leaving tomorrow.

797
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,779
You're home free.

798
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,281
Relax.

799
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,485
Not yet.

800
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,323
[sighs] not yet.

801
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,345
Hey, gabriel, you used
to work up there

802
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,480
On the high steel beams,
didn't you?

803
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,215
Yeah.

804
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,918
Ever afraid to fall?

805
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,788
No, I'm not afraid
of falling.

806
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,557
It's the landing
that scares me.

807
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,863
[helicopter]

808
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,478
[sirens]

809
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,381
Gabriel,
where's your picture?

810
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,185
Maybe they've given up.

811
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,853
They never give up.

812
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,890
Wow.

813
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,125
What?

814
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,763
Nothing.

815
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,799
Are you sure?

816
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,936
No. It's just that...

817
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,772
I--I must be
seeing things.

818
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,841
Maybe it's lack of sleep
or the memories,

819
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:48,844
But I look up there
and sometimes I--

820
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,813
That's bobby.

821
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,949
What are you seeing?

822
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,150
My son.

823
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,197
Bobby's alive.

824
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,832
Don't you get it?
It's a setup!

825
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,801
You're doing exactly
what lifecorps wants.

826
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,035
That was my son,

827
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,470
And if he's alive,
I'm gonna find him.

828
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,638
Don't you want
to think about it?

829
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:17,873
Nothing
to think about.

830
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,907
We have to
have a plan.

831
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,976
No, we don't.
We don't?

832
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,611
'cause you're not
going with me.

833
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:25,280
Excuse me,
this says I am.

834
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,682
You won't get past
reception without it.

835
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:36,858
We'll need
to get a lift.

836
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,631
Is it fixed?

837
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,199
There was nothing
wrong with it.

838
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,201
Then why was it
spewing out

839
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,536
Such ridiculously
high figures?

840
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,337
Must have been
a glitch.

841
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,472
Glitch?

842
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,974
No. I spent
hours on it.

843
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,310
Well, it's fine now.
I did the diagnostic,

844
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,680
Ran a comparative test--
it's 100%.

845
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,656
[monitor beeping]

846
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,821
If you think
this is over...

847
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,489
Think again.

848
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,267
[shouting]

849
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,977
Elliot: Come in.

850
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,747
Dr. Steele wishes
to see you.

851
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,882
At head office?

852
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,023
It takes two of you
to deliver this message?

853
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,925
We're here to
accompany you, sir.

854
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,727
Give me 2 minutes.

855
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:55,363
I have some papers
that she'll need.

856
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,512
The lifecorps building's
a fortress, gabriel.

857
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,514
I know. It's designed
to make sure

858
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,649
No client makes a last-minute
run for the door.

859
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,084
You're never gonna
get out of there.

860
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,253
Maybe not,
but I'll get in.

861
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,623
Advise your men--
this is a target runner.

862
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,391
They're not to use
hot loads.

863
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:24,993
We have a satellite trace
on the vehicle.

864
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,194
He's on his way, captain.

865
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,629
All right. Put 4 men
on the mezzanine

866
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,298
With sub-net guns
and secure the perimeter.

867
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,967
This is his only way in.

868
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,469
[tires squealing]

869
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,838
These guys are
a walking arsenal.

870
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,141
Look at this stuff.

871
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,476
Why do they carry
all this?

872
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,945
Some runners spend
the last year of their lives

873
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,047
Booby-trapping
their escape route.

874
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,550
Gotta be prepared
for anything.

875
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,185
Steele: Sit.

876
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,093
Rupert...
You knew that removing

877
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,061
The alpha transmitter
from mr. Gabriel

878
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,430
Was a violation
in company procedure.

879
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,632
Yes, I knew.

880
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,067
You were
the attending physician

881
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,203
For mr. Gabriel's son,
is that right?

882
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,405
That's right.

883
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,608
Is there anything
about this case

884
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,777
You feel
I ought to know?

885
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,663
[tires squealing]

886
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,264
So, let me get
this straight,

887
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,733
You're going to walk in
through the lobby,

888
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,802
Take the elevator
to the top floor,

889
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,772
Go straight to stofeles' office
and ask where your son is?

890
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,040
You got a better idea?

891
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,675
[scoffs]

892
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,477
This is not a great plan,
gabriel.

893
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,814
I know.
It needs some work.

894
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,349
Anton?
Hmm?

895
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,685
You got a moment?

896
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,154
Of course.

897
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,894
Bobby gabriel's
unique immune system

898
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:08,129
Is identified at
the annual school checkup.

The boy was purposely infected
by the ralph virus.

01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,407
This is the requisition
for the virus vaccine.

902
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,542
It was ordered on the day

903
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:24,512
That bobby gabriel
is listed as deceased.

904
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,314
Someone's been doing
their homework.

905
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,252
Tell me, anton...

906
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,755
You didn't deliberately
set up james gabriel

907
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,391
To sign that contract

908
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,893
So you could use
the both of them...

909
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:41,396
Did you?

910
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,738
Well...

911
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,176
Yes.

912
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:10,358
The board has
terminated you, anton,

913
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,027
And now I am in charge.

914
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:15,063
Where is bobby gabriel?

915
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:27,375
I posted those on the
internet with a time lock.

916
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,644
If anything happens to
that information or me--

917
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:34,082
That, dr. Elliot,
was not only disloyal,

918
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,718
But stupid!

919
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:39,154
Coming as it does on the heels
of your other transgressions,

920
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,689
I have no other choice
but to dismiss you.

921
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,691
Mr. Burke...

922
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,327
Do you have dr. Elliot's
severance package?

923
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:50,965
Yes, I do.

924
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,934
Right here.

925
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,170
Unh!

926
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,942
Now, helen...

927
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:03,678
Just a moment here.

928
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,414
I know things have
gotten...Extreme,

929
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,483
But I want you to look
at the bigger picture.

930
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,418
You're wasting
your breath.

931
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,555
The gabriels have something
in their blood

932
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,257
That could potentially
double life expectancy.

933
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,759
Think of the possibilities!

934
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:22,063
Lifecorps is nothing compared
to what you and I could do!

935
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,833
And become a mercenary?

936
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,102
Like--like this piece
of human slag?

937
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,604
No! I won't do it!

938
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,921
[cocks gun]

939
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,558
Putting a bullet
into my head

940
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,793
Won't change anything,
will it?

941
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,794
Oh, really?

942
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,930
Helen, helen...

943
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:57,599
Think of your
own mortality.

944
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:02,637
To be mentioned in the same
breath as salk and pauling.

945
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,306
My god,
you're both insane.

946
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,141
We don't have time
for this.

947
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,643
Helen, come with us.
No.

948
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:09,944
Please come with us!

949
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:13,615
All we need is the boy.
We can do without gabriel.

950
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,583
Thank you.

951
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,719
That's what
I've been waiting to hear.

952
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,087
This is burke.

953
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:20,088
Listen up!

954
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:21,089
All target restrictions

955
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:24,025
On runner gabriel,
james r. Rescinded.

956
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:27,328
Reload with hot ammunition,
shoot to kill.

957
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,397
Roger that!
Do it!

958
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:32,267
Full body armor,
visors down!

959
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,536
Anton, don't do this.
You know it's not right.

960
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,038
Excuse us,
dr. Steele.

961
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,339
Please!

962
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,110
Show me that card again.

963
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,848
Burke had a red card.

964
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,182
What?

965
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,450
When I first saw him
at lifecorps,

966
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,019
He had a red card.

967
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,187
That'd be for
the restricted floors.

968
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,423
78, I think.

969
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,563

Ohh!

973
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:09,737
Are you ready?

974
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,205
For what?

975
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,907
To leave.

976
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,843
The run's not over.

977
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:26,020
It's loaded.

978
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,036
Here we go.

979
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,822

983
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,197
Come on.

[ding]

985
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,426
Ok, which is
the restricted floor?

986
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:49,197
78. 78's always closed.

987
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,307
Burke: I think
they're in elevator 3.

988
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,342
Let's see where
they're going.

989
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,853
They're playing with us.

990
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,879
And now they're
starting to piss me off.

991
01:13:57,332 --> 01:14:00,935
Take this, take a squad,
and get down there.

992
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:11,445
[noises]

993
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:12,880
What was that?

994
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:33,701
Gabriel: Bobby?

995
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,102
Oh, my god.

996
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,107
Bobby?

997
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,445
Bobby?

998
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,050
Are you here
to take us home?

999
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:52,720
Hey, sweetie.

1000
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,655
Do you know where
bobby gabriel is?

1001
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,891
They took him upstairs.

1002
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,230
Come on.

1003
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:04,198
Stofeles must have
faked their deaths

1004
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,367
So he could
experiment on them.

1005
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,002
Yeah. I'll show him
where he can stick his--

1006
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,271
Hold it. In there.

1007
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,853
I'll get their attention.

1008
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,021
You get these kids
out of here.

1009
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,756
When you get
to the bottom floor,

1010
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,925
Start all
the elevators moving.

1011
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,526
And you?

1012
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,262
I'm gonna get
my kid back.

1013
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,198
He's got an army up there.
You don't have a chance.

1014
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,699
I've got a chance.

1015
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,716
Ok, shh. Quickly.
Come on, guys.

Be sure to push
all the buttons!

01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,160
Gabriel's in elevator 1.
He's coming up.

1023
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,967

shoot him.

Get internal security
down here.

You, get up to maintenance
and get the power back on.

What are you doing?

1047
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:46,907
I don't have 5 minutes.

01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:47,768
Not bad.

1054
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:40,654
Do it.

01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:45,592

have you both,

the possibilities.

01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,513
See if there's anything
worth salvaging.

1092
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,085
Bobby: Daddy!

1093
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,656
Can we go home now?

1094
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:43,991
You bet we can.

1095
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:46,159
Oh, yeah.

1096
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:51,698
Alex.

1097
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,668
Come here.

1098
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,244
Come here.

1099
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,861
I lied.

1100
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:23,964
I am afraid
of falling.

1101
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:26,066
I'll catch you.
