1
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,556
Fuck.

2
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,857
Come on!

3
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,673
No!

4
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,635
- Josephine!
- What?

5
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,610
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

6
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,181
Yeah, I can tell.

7
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,409
What's with the attitude?

8
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,883
I don't have
an attitude, Brian.

9
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,180
You see Hudson around?

10
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,050
- No, I ain't seen him.
- You haven't seen him.

11
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,680
Well, he punched his clock in,

12
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,452
So he's gotta be around
here somewhere.

13
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,083
I ain't nobody's babysitter.

14
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,788
Yeah, right. Seems like nobody
can find the guy, all right,

15
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,900
and if I find out you guys have been
punching his clock in...

16
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,729
people are gonna get fired,
you know what I mean?

17
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,029
I didn't check him in, Brian.

18
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,229
Yeah, whatever,
get back to work.

19
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,341
And enough of the lip.

20
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,737
Always a sweetheart.

21
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,418
That ain't nothin',

22
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,815
There's this guy around my way

23
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,148
called Tommy the Pole Hugger.

24
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,984
- Pole Hugger, huh?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,285
Tommy-- why he hug poles?

26
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,361
The motherfucker be hugging poles.

27
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,553
Shit, he be drunk as hell.

28
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,096
Yeah? Drunk?

29
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,529
I think that motherfucker
get high off of everything.

30
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,134
Every day, 2:00...

31
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,759
Every day at 2:00,

32
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,269
you can't miss him.

33
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,202
Here he come, down the street,

34
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,865
Staggering from pole to pole.

35
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,601
You gotta see him, man,
I'm telling you.

36
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,802
He can't even stand up barely,

37
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,846
but he make it from pole to pole,
all the way until he get home.

38
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,039
He'll get home, though?

39
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,411
That's some-- I'm tellin' you,

40
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,882
Some of the funniest shit
you ever saw.

41
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,213
It's funny as hell.

42
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,481
I don't even know how
he do that shit every day.

43
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,522
But shit...

44
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,094
I guess it's better to be
a drunk than to be a pervert.

45
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,873
Get out my face, Terry.

46
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,801
- Terry.
- Testy.

47
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,345
Get out of my face, Terry.

48
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,312
Get out of my business, Josephine.

49
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,541
You better hope Epstein
don't find out--

50
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,652
No, you better hope
Epstein don't find out.

51
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,117
What, you gonna tell him?

52
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,623
Next time you see me
over there with that girl,

53
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,191
why don't you just
go the other way?

54
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,191
Why don't you just try being
a little more professional,

55
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,420
and you ain't got
to worry about me?

56
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,154
Why don't you just
stay out of my business?

57
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,094
What the fuck was you
really lookin' at?

58
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,222
Uh-oh, what was
she lookin' at?

59
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,766
What you trying to see
a little something, huh?

60
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,234
There ain't much to see, I'm sure.

61
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,601
Oh, my bad, yeah...

62
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,100
Well, maybe you wasn't
looking at me.

63
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,540
Maybe you was looking
at the girl.

64
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,670
Right, right, I was
looking at the girl.

65
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,248
Yeah, I bet you was.

66
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,248
What was that, a confession?

67
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,875
Yeah, you look like
you could go that way.

68
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,190
Fucking dike.

69
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,518
What the fuck
you just call me?

70
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,422
I swear to God, Terry,
if you don't leave me

71
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,620
the fuck alone up here,
we always gotta go through this.

72
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,855
Ooh, I swear...

73
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,488
Go ahead, right here,
right here, right here.

74
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,998
Give it to me.

75
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,101
Get out,
get the fuck out, man.

76
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,224
I ain't gonna mess with her,

77
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,496
I'm just fuckin' with her, man.

78
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,266
If you mind your business,
we won't go through this.

79
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,669
I swear to God,
one more time...

80
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,743
Go ahead, go ahead, right here.
I'll give you one, go ahead.

81
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,401
Leave it, man. Leave it.

82
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,672
I'll give you a free shot,
right here.

83
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,042
You know what?
Fuck you, Terry.

84
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,581
No, fuck you.

85
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,380
What the fuck,
you like her or something?

86
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,421
No, it's work, man.

87
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,990
I don't fucking like her though, man.

88
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,558
She's weird as hell.

89
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,251
She act like she
can't be around us.

90
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,022
She over here, we over there.

91
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,460
But we cool.

92
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,657
She all by herself, man.
Fuck that.

93
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,601
Fuck her, man. And you?

94
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,693
I don't know about you, man.

95
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,033
Maybe you should be

96
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,231
fucking eating lunch with her.

97
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,137
- You think we like her?
- What?

98
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,243
You can't tell?

99
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,469
Every time I say
something about her

100
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,375
he's grabbing me, holding me,

101
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,503
saying, "Terry, don't."

102
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,377
It's not about her, it's about work.

103
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,246
Just keep it smooth, it's work--

104
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,875
But we ain't working
right now, we on break.

105
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,248
No need to argue.

106
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,151
A little bit of fun,
I'm just fuckin' with her.

107
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,552
It's fun? It's fun?

108
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,990
Yeah.

109
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,053
See how she left
up out of here?

110
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,858
Fuck her, man.

111
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,563
Is that Charlie Parker?

112
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,964
What?

113
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,334
You were humming.
Was it Charlie Parker?

114
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,236
No.

115
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,646
You know it's funny,
when I was a--

116
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,754
OK.

117
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,263
Miss...

118
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,433
Miss, did you see that?

119
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,599
Leave me alone.

120
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,990
What are you doing?

121
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,689
Somebody help me!

122
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,165
Somebody help me!

123
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,808
Help me!

124
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,428
Help!

125
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,631
Brian, Brian! Brian!

126
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,933
Yo, what are you
touching me for?

127
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,666
- He killed a guy!
- Josephine, get off me!

128
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,777
- Call the cops!
- You're fired!

129
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,558
Ah!

130
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,558
Is my lawyer here yet?

131
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,760
Not yet.

132
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,935
That's a nice necklace
you got there.

133
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,044
- That's not gold, is it?
- No, it isn't.

134
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,203
You don't look the type

135
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,246
to get fancy with the bling-bling.

136
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,778
I don't spend my money
on that stupid shit,

137
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:39,885
is that all right with you?

138
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,247
So, what you're telling me is,

139
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,911
You wouldn't spend
any money on it,

140
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,022
but you would wear it, right?

141
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,646
Is that what you're saying?

142
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,452
Can you just please go
see if my lawyer's here?

143
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,163
You holding out on me?

144
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,926
I told you everything I know.

145
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,792
You see, my problem is
that I believe you.

146
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,770
I believe that everything
you told us is true.

147
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,771
But what I don't believe
is that you gave us

148
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,307
everything that you know.

149
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,877
Your story's got
a lot of holes in it.

150
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,310
I need some more information
if I'm gonna be able to let you go.

151
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,006
If you believe me,
why am I handcuffed

152
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,174
to this fucking truck?

153
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,655
OK.

154
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,790
I'm listening.

155
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,834
Look, I told you
everything I know.

156
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,530
I was scared, I was running
for my fucking life.

157
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,333
I don't know why it happened.

158
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,237
Honey, that's the same story.

159
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,703
All right,
you're not going anywhere

160
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,507
until you start filling in the gaps.

161
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,843
Everything that you
told us is great,

162
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,976
but we need to find out
exactly what's going on.

163
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,781
So you gotta come forth,
let's do it.

164
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,818
I told you everything I know.

165
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,324
I just want to go home.

166
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,088
Look, I want to go home too.

167
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,628
But you and me,
we're not going anywhere

168
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,026
until you start
filling in the holes.

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,930
So I'll tell you
what we do know.

170
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,470
Nobody saw the young boy get killed
at the basketball court,

171
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,507
nobody saw Brian Epstein
get killed in the office here,

172
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,373
and nobody saw John Doe
get killed outside.

173
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,945
But what we do know

174
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,277
is that all three of them
were brutally murdered

175
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,614
using the same weapon
by the same person.

176
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,721
Are you that person?

177
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,686
No.

178
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,621
We interviewed some of
your co-workers earlier today,

179
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,228
and they said you had a big
disagreement with Brian Epstein.

180
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,693
Are you fucking crazy?

181
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,195
You think I did that to Brian?

182
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,197
I saw Brian get murdered.

183
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,859
The only thing you got
going for you right now

184
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,493
is that the lady
at the bus stop said

185
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,832
she saw you being
chased by somebody,

186
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,032
but she couldn't identify them.

187
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,144
- Was that Brian Epstein?
- Absolutely not.

188
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,771
You got anything else
you can give me?

189
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,849
Any information
to help me out?

190
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,918
Anything to help you out?

191
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,086
I can't even think straight.

192
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,349
I don't know anything else.

193
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,823
All right, you can go.

194
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,992
What's up, baby?

195
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,502
Hey.

196
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,501
How you feel?

197
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,576
What's up?

198
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,808
What's up?

199
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,216
I'm so scared.

200
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,018
I know, baby, I know.

201
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,956
Don't worry about it.

202
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,424
You feel better now? No?

203
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,055
Just tired.

204
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,168
Come on, let's go in the room.

205
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,530
Tell Papi everything.
What's up?

206
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,598
What's on your mind?

207
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,368
Don't cry, baby.
Don't cry, please.

208
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,373
I saw Brian get killed.

209
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,533
I feel so bad because

210
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,077
I know we had
our problems...

211
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,048
I ran up to him
and I was standing--

212
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,651
I was right in front
of him when it happened.

213
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,984
And I feel so bad.

214
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,955
I mean, the guy playing ball,
I was just watching him

215
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,291
and I saw him get grabbed...

216
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,604
I don't understand why
somebody would do that

217
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,433
to somebody else.

218
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,567
Boo, a lot of people
these days,

219
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,973
they don't know
what they're doing.

220
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,238
They don't know why they do it.

221
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,042
The only thing you can do
is keep being you, you know?

222
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,775
You can't change that.

223
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,882
Try not to cry.

224
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,152
Let's lay down for a minute,

225
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,590
get some rest.

226
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,789
Don't leave the room.

227
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,795
I'm not going anywhere,
baby. Don't worry.

228
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,467
I'll be right here, all right?

229
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,228
Hello? Hello?

230
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:13,998
Steve, baby, get up.

231
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,697
They're breaking in!

232
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,469
- Who?
- I don't know!

233
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,744
Hurry up!

234
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,653
Hurry up!

235
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,286
Baby, what's going on?

236
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,728
What's going...

237
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,362
What the fuck is going on?

238
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,771
Steve?

239
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,642
Stop! Stop!
No wait, come back!

240
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,766
Please, wait...

241
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,532
Please...

242
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,000
You gotta hurry up.

243
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,634
Come on, you gotta hurry up.

244
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,031
Jesus fucking Christ, woman.

245
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,135
Would you fucking die already?

246
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,020
Where the fuck is she?

247
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,136
- Sorry.
- Where is she?

248
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,114
- Help me!
- Come back!

249
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,514
Somebody help me!

250
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,052
I'm not gonna hurt you.

251
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,487
I don't want to hurt you.

252
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,252
I just want to cut
your fucking heart out.

253
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,070
Somebody...

254
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,116
Hello?

255
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,007
Hello?

256
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,217
Anybody?

257
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,718
Hello?

258
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,657
Hello?

259
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,997
Hello?

260
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,593
Hello?

261
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,998
Somebody...

262
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,869
Sir, excuse me...

263
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,977
What?

264
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,340
Hi.

265
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,538
How are you doing?

266
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,240
You in trouble?
Can I help you?

267
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,449
I was just wondering

268
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,556
if any one of you were...

269
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,453
Oh, my...

270
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,829
Can I help you?

271
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,699
Help!

272
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,392
Help me!

273
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,995
Somebody help me!

274
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,450
Help!

275
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,955
Help me! Help me!

276
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,499
Help me!

277
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:47,296
Help me!
They're gonna kill me!

278
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,609
- You gotta help me!
- Help you?

279
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,370
- You gotta help me.
- With what?

280
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,080
Get out of here.
Just get out of here.

281
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,746
- Listen to me, they're gonna kill all of us.
- I don't care.

282
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,659
Yo, who the hell are you?

283
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,392
I'm not helping you.
Get the hell out of here.

284
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,628
- Listen to me.
- Get the hell out of here.

285
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,599
They're gonna kill us both.

286
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:25,834
They're all over the place.

287
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:26,944
I don't care. Get out of here.

288
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,739
Who's all over the place?

289
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,145
You gotta help me!

290
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,979
Oh, man! Damn!

291
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,421
- Damn it!
- You have to do something.

292
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,856
Please do something.

293
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,095
They're gonna kill all of us.

294
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,179
Get out of here!

295
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,712
Come on, let's go,
let's go.

296
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,855
I'm gonna get you!

297
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,503
Come on,
you have to come on.

298
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,170
We have to keep going.

299
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,512
Stupid bitch,
leave me the hell alone.

300
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,085
I can't do this by myself.

301
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,155
I need to find a phone,
I have to find my husband.

302
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,347
Help you?

303
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,822
Listen, just leave me
the hell alone.

304
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,153
Get out of here, all right?

305
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,056
Look, I need to find a phone.

306
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,560
All I want to do
is get my husband

307
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,664
and get home.

308
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,787
We're in the woods.

309
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,126
How you gonna find
a phone around here?

310
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,928
Oh, we're in the woods?
I hadn't noticed.

311
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,331
I still need to get a phone.

312
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,937
I have to get out of here.

313
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,632
Look, I have to find
my husband.

314
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,003
I can't do this by myself.

315
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,077
Husband? He's probably dead,
all right?

316
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,610
Just get out of here
and leave me the hell--

317
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,008
How the hell did you
get out here anyway?

318
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,547
I'm part of a demolition crew.

319
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,876
Look, we were gonna
blow up a building

320
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,780
and all this fucked-up shit
started happening.

321
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,250
Now my husband is missing.

322
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,548
And who the hell are those people?
They seem to know you.

323
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,247
Listen, I don't know
who the hell they are,

324
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,653
all I know is I roll with the tribe.

325
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,055
Wherever they go I go, all right?

326
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,786
We live in abandoned buildings,
old mills,

327
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,659
anywhere until someone kicks us out,
and then we move on.

328
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,994
- Leave me alone.
- Oh great, so you guys are bums.

329
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,328
Where I'm from bums
don't eat people.

330
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,834
Bums? I'm not a bum,
all right?

331
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,267
Different strokes for
different folks, all right?

332
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,804
Whatever you say.

333
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,564
All right, look--

334
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,438
I don't know how
I got out here,

335
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,636
I need to find my husband.

336
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,871
Can you please help me
find my husband?

337
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,973
Listen, your husband
is probably dead, all right?

338
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,551
Just get out of here.
Whatever you do--

339
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,278
call the cops,
call the Navy,

340
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,584
Just leave me the hell alone
and leave me out of it.

341
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,749
But just leave me out of it.

342
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,622
Forget about him?
He's my fucking husband.

343
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,094
You know what, just shut up
and show me the way out of here.

344
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,528
You shut up.

345
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,531
Listen, let's just get
out of here, all right?

346
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,034
I'll show you the way out
but leave me alone after that.

347
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,949
Stupid... stupid, man...

348
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,302
All right, all right, all right,
don't go anywhere else.

349
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,631
Listen, this is what
you're gonna do:

350
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,568
You're gonna go right over there,
where those trees are.

351
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,369
After the trees
you're gonna see a river.

352
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,738
You cross through that river,

353
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,142
there's gonna be a big, tall mountain.

354
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,180
Go over that mountain,
there's gonna be a road,

355
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,545
once you get on that road
you'll see everything you need,

356
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,776
and just leave me the hell alone,

357
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,216
forget all the hell about it.

358
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,682
Go!

359
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,619
Go!

360
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:04,728
Thanks.

361
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,022
Yeah, whatever.

362
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,392
Just get out of here.

363
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,895
Damn.

364
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,029
Damn!

365
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,769
Damn.

366
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,938
Damn!

367
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,016
No!

368
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,199
Steve?

369
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,615
Steve?

370
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,017
Steve?

371
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,275
Wait!

372
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,438
Wait, please wait.

373
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,740
Please!

374
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,824
Shit!

375
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,201
Oh, man...

376
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,040
Are you all right?

377
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,044
Oh, my God!

378
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,236
Oh, my--

379
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:05,375
Oh, my--

380
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,351
Do you have a cell phone?
Can you hear me?

381
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:09,850
Can you hear me?

382
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,079
Do you have a cell phone?

383
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,155
They cut me.

384
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,322
Do you have a cell phone?
Do you have a cell phone?

385
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,723
Talk to me!

386
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,832
Listen...

387
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,172
Oh, my God...

388
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
Please, please...

389
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,705
Come on...

390
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,551
Please, please...

391
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,324
Ahh! Josephine!

392
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,453
Josephine!

393
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,224
Steve? Steve?

394
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:36,696
Josephine!

395
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:40,828
Steve!

396
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:42,666
Josephine!

397
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,036
Jo-Jo...

398
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,910
Jo-Josephine!

399
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,275
Ahh!

400
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,746
Ahh! Josephine!

401
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,687
Josephine!

402
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,588
Josephine!

403
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,256
Ahh! Josephine!

404
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,229
Josephine!

405
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,665
Steve?

406
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,799
Motherfucker!

407
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,877
Motherfuckers.

408
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:29,946
I swear to God...

409
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,717
You want to play? All right.

410
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,255
All right.

411
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,555
Motherfuckers.

412
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,556
Fuckers, all right...

413
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,391
Come on, come on...

414
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,970
All right...

415
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,693
Eat this, motherfuckers!

416
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:56,926
Yeah, motherfucker, burn!

417
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,260
Fuck!

418
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,122
Oh, Steve...

419
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,176
Steve?

420
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,880
Steve?

421
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,372
Steve?

422
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,694
Steve...

423
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,562
Steve...

424
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,377
Come here!
Get her, get her.

425
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,607
Get off!

426
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:55,885
Tie her up! Tie her up!

427
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,012
Tie her up!

428
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,613
Stay still!

429
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,156
Let me get up
and I'll fuck you up!

430
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,418
Shut the fuck up!

431
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,586
Yeah, shut up.

432
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,201
Shut up.
She movin' still?

433
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,665
Just shut up.

434
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,398
Get her fucking hands.

435
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,389
We gotta get out of here.

436
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,584
Oh my G--

437
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,785
Oh, God.

438
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,896
Hey, Jo...

439
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,400
You gotta help me.

440
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:48,904
I'm fucking bleeding.

441
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,972
Who the fuck was those guys?

442
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,705
Come on, Jo...

443
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,382
I know I was fucking
with you before,

444
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,007
But I was only playing, man.

445
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,017
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

446
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,183
Shut up,
I hear somebody coming.

447
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,137
You done well, gentlemen.

448
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,714
Perfect.

449
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,944
Gentlemen, back off.
This is dinner, relax.

450
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,818
You'll all have your turn.

451
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,031
This one smells vile.

452
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,433
You're spoiling.

453
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:00,668
Smell that.

454
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,176
It's spoiled rotten.

455
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,406
It's impossible,
he's still breathing.

456
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,845
Impossible?

457
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,251
Maybe you should be
on this hook.

458
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,023
Now this one...

459
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,051
This is a whole
other ball park.

460
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,355
Yeah.

461
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,534
Gentleman, I will not
say "back off" again.

462
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,368
I said back off!

463
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,737
Yes, yes...

464
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,773
So fresh...

465
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,320
Open your eyes.

466
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,685
Look at me. Look at me.

467
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,485
Yes...

468
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,720
Knife.

469
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,797
Let's just have a sample.

470
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,364
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

471
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:59,764
And why not, huh?

472
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,495
I have diseases you can't
even pronounce.

473
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,299
Impossible.

474
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,566
We had your husband
about an hour ago,

475
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,005
and I feel great!

476
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,876
No!

477
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,313
Till death do us part.

478
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,378
No! Come back here, bitch!

479
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,415
- Come back here!
- Motherfucker!

480
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,235
Steve?

481
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:40,883
Steve?

482
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,869
Hey, Doc, we should go.

483
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,472
We should get
out of here, Doc.

484
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,236
Time to go, huh?

485
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,485
Wrap that one to go.

486
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,708
That's fresh.
I like the smell.

487
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,004
Yeah... I like that.

488
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,238
You guys have done me well.

489
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,350
You guys are my brothers.

490
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,645
You smell that though?

491
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,755
You know what that smell is?

492
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,380
That smell is
a small smell of success.

493
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,426
Fresh flesh I consider a success.

494
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,162
And you guys are helping me
achieve that success.

495
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,759
You are my brothers.

496
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,963
- Am I right or wrong?
- Right, yeah.

497
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,938
It's me.
It's me, it's Josephine. Shh.

498
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,045
Those streets are ours.

499
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:24,942
- Am I right or wrong?
- Yeah.

500
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,072
What are we doing
down here hiding?

501
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:29,741
What do we have to hide from?

502
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,375
We own those streets up there.

503
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,249
They should be hiding from us.

504
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,855
That...

505
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,017
That's only a small portion
of what we could have.

506
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,218
He's one out of a million.

507
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:42,787
Let's go back up there
and take our streets, gentlemen.

508
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,160
Can we take our streets? Hmm?

509
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,392
Damn, right!

510
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,592
Can we?

511
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,500
I need your guys' help.
I can't do this alone.

512
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:50,605
I need you guys to recruit,

513
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,139
I need you guys to go up there

514
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,536
and back 'em down.

515
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,405
If they don't want to run,

516
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,307
bring 'em back down here

517
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:58,970
and we hack 'em.

518
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,140
Everything belongs to us

519
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,615
from here on out.

520
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,221
We don't need money.
We don't need wealth.

521
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,550
We need the flesh.

522
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,057
You know the drill.

523
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:15,490
Uh...

524
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,360
What's the name
of the mission, sir?

525
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,231
Operation...

526
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,271
Gumbo.

527
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,373
Now, as I was saying,
I need you--

528
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:28,704
Uh, sir...

529
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,335
Didn't we just have a mission,
Operation Gumbo?

530
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,581
OK, how about
operation gumbo 2?

531
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,484
As I was saying,
first things first.

532
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:42,352
I need you to take
the south side for me.

533
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:45,722
Uh, sir, no disrespect,
I'm sorry, but...

534
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:46,987
Operation Gumbo 2?

535
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,188
I mean, that's kind of
cheesy, right?

536
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,423
I mean, shouldn't we
name it something else?

537
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,534
Sequels are always the worst.

538
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,763
I'm right, right?

539
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,338
I'm sorry...

540
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,533
I can't really hear you.

541
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:01,108
I need you to open
your mouth a little bit wider

542
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,574
when you speak.

543
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,769
Step a little closer.

544
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,475
- What did you say?
- Operation Gumbo 2?

545
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,052
I mean, that's kind of
cheesy, right?

546
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,247
- And your name is?
- Benedict, sir.

547
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,483
- What's my name?
- You're the doctor.

548
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,320
Exactly.

549
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,594
Now, Benedict...

550
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,462
I will name my operations

551
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,230
whatever I see fit
to name my operations...

552
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,469
Bene-dict.

553
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,646
Cheesy...

554
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:43,910
Yeah!

555
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,523
Yeah.

556
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,124
Gentlemen...

557
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,319
Eggs Benedict tomorrow

558
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,225
Yeah! Yeah!

559
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:56,422
Now let's get to work.

560
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,964
Right.

561
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,499
Shh, shh...

562
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,470
Come on.

563
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,271
Shh, be quiet.

564
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,813
Be quiet.

565
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,021
It's me, it's all right.

566
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,821
Come on.

567
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:30,128
Baby, come on.

568
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,031
Baby, come on.

569
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,467
Listen, come on.

570
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,595
It's Josephine.
Baby, it's me.

571
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,265
Listen, listen, it's me, baby.

01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,220
Sit down. Listen...

574
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:56,987
Baby, listen, listen, listen.

575
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,855
Don't move, OK?

576
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,323
I'm gonna find a way
out of here.

577
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,055
Don't move, OK?

578
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:18,302
Josephine!

579
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,511
Josephine!

580
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,312

Josephine!

585
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,700
I'll bring her to you.

586
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:46,137
Josephine!

587
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,568
Josephine!

588
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,203
Josephine!

589
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,045
Josephine!

590
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,021
Hold him down,

591
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,647
Josephine!

592
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,597
And now for the finale, baby.

593
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,975
Oh, no. Oh, shoot!

594
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,849
Josephine!

595
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,303
I told you to wait.

596
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,502
I told you to wait.

597
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,083
Eat that!

598
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:46,889
Motherfucker!

599
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,829
Fucker! Fucker!

600
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,635
Where the fuck are you?

601
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,614
Hold it!

602
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:11,879
Drop the fucking knife.

603
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,847
- What's going on?
- Drop the knife.

604
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,925
Drop the gun,
we can talk.

605
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,391
Put the knife down.

606
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:20,859
OK, OK, OK.

607
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,021
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

608
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:25,463
It's just me and you now.
It's just me and you now.

609
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,659
I'll walk.

610
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:27,894
We can work together.

611
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,833
I see how you enjoyed it downstairs,
come on.

612
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,132
Why do you think I didn't
eat you a long time ago?

613
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:32,604
You took my life from me.

614
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,106
I gave you that. Relax.

615
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,904
Listen to me...

616
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,272
Listen to me. Look...

617
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,812
We're in the final chapter, man.

618
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,313
We're in the final chapter.
We can work together.

619
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,850
You enjoyed this.
You like this shit.

620
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,180
Get back.

621
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,685
Ok, relax.
I'll tell you what,

622
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,813
I make you feel uncomfortable,
put that gun down.

623
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,117
You don't want to use that.

624
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,284
You want to work with me,
you want to join me.

625
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,656
Everybody else is dead,
you're the only one left.

626
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:54,820
Back off!

627
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,362
OK, OK, listen,
I make you uncomfortable?

628
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,159
I tell you what,
I'll talk to you from here.

629
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,495
You're a queen, I'll get on
my knees for you, OK?

630
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,103
You made it through, listen--

631
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,673
Now we can listen
to the real man, all right?

632
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,176
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

633
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,077
Are you fucking kidding me?

634
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,740
Are you fucking
kidding me, huh?

635
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:17,875
You can't have
a fucking gun with no bullets.

636
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,214
You faking me out, huh?

637
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,845
You know what?
I'm gonna fucking carve you.

638
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,289
Come on, baby.

639
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,363
Come on, Josephine,
the fun begins now!

640
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,056
Let's go, baby.

641
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,258
Whoo!

642
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,467
Come on, Josephine.

643
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,597
Come on, baby.

644
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,937
Come on, come on, baby.

645
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,344
Come on. Come on.

646
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,514
You can do better than that.
Come on, come on, bitch.

647
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,484
Huh? Huh?

648
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:58,388
What do I look like,
the rest of those motherfuckers?

649
01:14:58,527 --> 01:14:59,585
Huh?

650
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,695
Is that the best you could do?

651
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,387
I gave you an opportunity, baby.

652
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:06,160
I gave you an opportunity.
I gave you an opportunity.

653
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,598
Didn't l, huh?

654
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,533
I gave you an opportunity
to work on me, didn't l?

655
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:11,936
Oh, shit.

656
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,605
Oh, man.

657
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,048
Oh, man.

Let's go.

667
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,405
Let's do it for real now.

668
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,008
Come on, attack me.

669
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,677
Yeah.

01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:56,613
That's what I'm talking about.

01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,044
Come on, again.

672
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:00,279
You ready? Again.

Why you running?
Aren't you hungry, bitch?

It isn't funny now, is it?

676

Is it?
