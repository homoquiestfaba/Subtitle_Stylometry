1
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:59,368
Journal entry number 11345-1.

2
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,703
3:20 p.m., Thursday, June 6th.

3
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,743
The concentration of serotonin
has been increased

4
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,644
by two milligrams...

5
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:13,048
and dissolved in
a 0.8 saline solution.

6
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:16,110
Uh-uh, point 5.

7
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:21,683
Correction, 0.5 saline.

8
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,289
Yesterday's slight increase
didn't make any difference

9
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,389
in tissue absorption.

10
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:28,626
Mmm.

11
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,138
We're optimistic that
the serotonin increase

12
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,367
will be sufficient to produce
an intensified level of aggression

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,411
without causing harmful
side affects.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,877
Where's McConnel'!

15
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,616
(sighs )

16
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,480
( beeping )

17
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,422
( exhales )

18
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,007
(continues to breathe deeply)

19
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,280
(rapid heartbeat)

20
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,023
If this new solution proves
effective in the animals...

21
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,395
we will begin human testing.

22
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,491
(door crashes open)

23
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,933
Hey...

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,163
the gang's all here.

25
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,409
All right...

26
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,912
final phase.

27
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,644
We hope to be able to show
that aggressive behavior

28
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,279
is triggered by fluctuations
in brain chemistry,

29
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,758
as well as fluctuations in
neurotransmitters, such as serotonin.

30
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,261
- ( Glove snaps)
- Spank me harder, baby.

31
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,031
- ( Animals screeching)
- Oh, sorry.

32
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,901
Ethanol oestradiol, LHRH.

33
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,776
Maintained at minus
15 degrees Celsius.

34
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,043
If we can prove
Dr. Burns' theory...

35
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:29,019
then we believe by manipulating
the level of MAO-A enzyme,

36
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:32,353
which breaks down neuro-
transmitters...

37
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,791
we should be able to control
aggressive and hyperactive behavior.

38
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,850
( Hisses )

39
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,666
One milligram of ethanol oestradiol

40
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:55,611
to increase plasma
testosterone.

41
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,706
(computer beeping)

42
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,080
Computer voice:
E-Mail for Doctor Irwin Burns.

43
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,278
Urgent.

44
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,786
Now whatl'!

45
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,440
(electronic beeps)

46
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,393
What's going on'!

47
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,158
All right.

48
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,756
Increase the serotonin
by 25 milligrams...

49
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,302
and add 20 milligrams
of the amantadine.

50
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,736
Hello?
What are you guys doing?

51
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,205
Dr. Burns had carefully
measured that.

52
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,243
Exactly! Carefully,
carefully, carefully.

53
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,208
Breakthroughs aren't made
carefully and conservatively,

54
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,575
daddy's little girl.

55
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,081
Science is about taking risks
and pushing boundaries.

56
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,707
But we've been making
such progress.

57
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,343
Okay, 25 more milligrams
of ethanol oestradiol.

58
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,716
You think so'!

59
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,722
I've made more progress
in one day with my own testing

60
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,621
than your father's made
in three goddamn years.

61
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,887
Not that he'd now it of course,
because he never listens to me.

62
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,556
What are you talking about?
He highly values your expertise.

63
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,498
Bullshit! He keeps everything
under lock and key.

64
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,263
He's so secretive,
he's gotta do it all himself.

65
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,270
Cause he's a paranoid,
old wimpy geek.

66
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,567
It's time we made some
goddamn progress around here.

67
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,508
Hmm.

68
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,948
Toshi, how can you betray him'!, how can you betray him'!, how can you betray him'!

69
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,387
She's just as sick
of your father as I am.

70
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,925
- But he is in charge of this.
- Not any more.

71
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,983
And there's nothing
he can do about it.

72
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,055
Sixteen milligrams of rubidium,

73
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,099
and ten milligrams
of ethyl alcohol.

74
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,402
Don't bother.
I changed the key code.

75
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,672
(electronic buzzing )

76
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,577
Open this door.

77
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,281
I demand that you open
this door!

78
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,083
Irwin!

79
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,951
Irwin!

80
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,820
Oh shit!
It's reacting.

81
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,157
(shouts )

82
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,355
Kat h ryn ?

83
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,455
That shouldn't be happening.

84
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,501
We checked the calculations
three times.

85
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,695
McConnel:oh,shit!:oh,shit!:
Oh, shit!

86
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,234
I; Dad:
I; Dad:

87
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,240
- ( alarm sounds)
- Kathryn!

88
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,717
Oh, God...

89
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,982
Kat h Kat h Kat h fyn!!!

90
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,985
Kathryn! Aaaah!

91
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,056
Oh, God.

92
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,581
Kathryn.

93
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,541
( Hissing )

94
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,984
( hissing )

95
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,690
- (screams )
- Kathryn!

96
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,801
Kat h ryn! Kat h ryn!

97
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,842
Come on.

98
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,509
Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the street...

99
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,678
...merrily, merrily
life's a bowl of treats.

100
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:27,071
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the street...

101
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,790
Row, row row your boat
gently down the street...

102
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,557
merrily, merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily, merrily...

103
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,257
pop goes the weasel.

104
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,357
- (screams )
- ( laughs )

105
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,959
I'm telling.
You're in big trouble.

106
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,936
Scaredy cat. Scaredy cat.
Scaredy cat.

107
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,973
I hate you.
I'm telling mom.

108
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,255
Looks like you'll be around
a couple more years.

109
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,527
Well, the Mrs.'ll be disappointed.

110
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,762
So, I'm not having
a heart attack, huh, Brad'!

111
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,304
It's probably just
a had case of indigestion.

112
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,340
But let me go check
on those test results.

113
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,773
Maybe it's just
Betty's sausages.

114
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,005
Mmm. I'm gonna miss those.
I'll be right hack.

115
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,587
(whispering ) Poor thing.
Brad breakin' her heart like that

116
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,629
That's not what I heard.

117
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,154
I heard he wanted her to move
to the city with him...

118
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,792
but she turned him down flat.

119
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,895
What a shame, those two
were made for each other.

120
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,964
Maybe she'll change her mind.

121
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,304
She's got too much
of her father's stubbornness.

122
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,846
You know those Biddies.

123
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,573
Maybe he'll change his mind.

124
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,911
Thanks, Sam.
Have a nice day.

125
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,448
Just as I thought,
everything's fine.

126
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,619
If you weren't carryin'
around this baby...

127
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,491
you'd be a whole lot
better off.

128
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,531
This baby's the lifeblood
of this town.

129
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,294
And I can guarantee
a couple of inches

130
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,392
by the end of the festival.

131
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,597
Rumor has it, Juergen's outdone
himself with this years brew.

132
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,436
Mm-mmm. So I'm told.

133
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,339
You do plan on hanging out
with us small town folk

134
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,844
at least through the weekend,
don't you'!

135
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,174
Nope. Gotta go tomorrow.

136
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,611
Well, we're all gonna miss ya.

137
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,811
Especially a certain
pretty cop I know.

138
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,616
Who happens to get her
good looks from her daddy.

139
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,953
I'm only four hours away.

140
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,583
(hysterically) Dr. Kagen, something's wrong.
I don't know what to do.

141
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,616
He won't talk, I found him
lying in the woods--

142
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,619
Slow down, Mrs. Stills.
Take it easy.

143
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,427
Let's just get him
on the table.

144
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,262
Let me get out of your way.

145
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,462
Grace, don't worry, the doctor
'll take care of Mikey.

146
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,902
Everything's gonna be all right.

147
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,597
Thanks, Mayor.

148
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,141
I've never seen him like this.
I can't get him to respond.

149
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,438
- What's wrong with him'!
- He's in shock.

150
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,877
I can't even get him
to let go of his toy.

151
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,580
(rattling - gunshot)

152
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,041
Let's go.

153
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,222
I got him.
25 yards.

154
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,189
Northeast.

155
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,225
Son of a bitch.

156
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,360
I see him.
Watch out! Watch out!

157
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,365
- He's right there.
- Shoot, damn it. Shoot!

158
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,359
Damn!

159
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,057
All right, Jesse.
Kickin' ass!

160
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,889
The bushmaster!
(hollering - laughing )

161
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,054
Oh, man, what a chase.

162
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,961
Let's see the trophy, Jess.

163
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,969
No more hoppin' for you
Mr. Rabbit.

164
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,371
- ( laughs )
- Oh, man.

165
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,618
( Whistles )
Hey, Corky.

166
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,915
Hey, Corky.

167
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,352
Hey, girl.

168
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,860
Hey, Corky.
Come on fetch.

169
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,912
Damn lazy dog.

170
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,733
( Hissing )

171
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,364
Oh, I almost forgot.

172
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,634
I got something for you.

173
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,267
Thanks.

174
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,277
That was, uh, that was sweet.

175
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,119
Oh, cool.

176
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,286
This is the exact one I wanted.
How'd you know'!

177
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,227
Where'd you get it'!
Jesse doesn't carry this one.

178
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,392
I had him, um, special order
that for you.

179
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,595
It's got 256k. You got rolodex,
you got dayplanner.

180
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,969
Plus an alarm, world time, map,
reminder, password access.

181
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,199
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,037
And you can hackload it all
on your computer.

183
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,111
I know this is the one I wanted.
They're great.

184
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,614
I was gonna get one for myself,
but um...

185
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,050
you know me, I'm more of
a paper and pen kinda gal.

186
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,554
Besides there's nothing like
the smell of a good leather hinder.

187
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,852
What am I doing?

188
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,688
What am I doing?

189
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,951
(sighs )
It's so easy to slip hack.

190
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,265
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,567
I'm sorry, Jo.

192
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,302
You know how
I feel about you...

193
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,038
but I, I can't do this.

194
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,809
It's not, it's not fair
for either of us.

195
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,908
I don't want to change my mind.

196
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,975
There's just...

197
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,749
there's just
so many things that I...

198
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,118
that I want to accomplish,

199
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,954
things I'm never gonna get
to do in a small town.

200
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,121
I mean you have to go to
the city, the big city...

201
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,859
to be a specialist,
to be at the big hospital...

202
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,425
I'm tired of everybody knowing
everybody else's business,

203
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,472
and I...

204
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,131
I know, I know we've been
through all this before hut...

205
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,244
I wish you would change
your mind and come.

206
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,247
(sighs )

207
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,374
Just, just come with me please?

208
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,755
We have been through
this before.

209
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,722
The timing's off.

210
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,687
Your wants and needs are...

211
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,854
are different than mine.

212
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,795
I'm happy here and you're not.

213
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,500
Beside's we're like, what,
only four hours away'!

214
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,947
Yeah.

215
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,477
Police radio:
Jo, you there'!

216
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,016
Jo?

217
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,551
Yeah, Ben, go ahead.

218
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,525
Call just came in from
old man Simpson's.

219
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,323
Sounds pretty serious.

220
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,762
Find Pat and bring him
with you.

221
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,858
Dr. Kagen's still fishing.
He won't be hack till tomorrow.

222
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,527
Damn...

223
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,537
Has Brad left yet'!

224
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,598
I think he's still around.

225
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,108
Well, find him.
We need him.

226
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,405
Be right there.

227
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,409
I'm sure it's nothing.

228
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,871
Brad, glad you're still around.

229
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,603
Ya just caught me,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

230
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,044
- Nice to see you, Brad.
- Yeah, you too, Bud.

231
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,274
So whatta we got'!

232
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,181
Well, we got a call
from Jimmy Ray.

233
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,743
He was delivering groceries
when he found Simpson inside.

234
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:20,154
- What's wrong with him'!
- Well, he's pretty dead.

235
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,055
What happened'!

236
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,684
Tryin' to figure that out.

237
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,093
Seems old man Simpson was
chopping wood here,

238
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,928
when somethin' must a surprised
him and attacked him.

239
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,558
Somethin' what'!

240
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,863
Tryin' to figure that out.

241
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,029
And he struggled to make it
all the way inside.

242
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,539
What's this from'!

243
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,541
You're trying to figure
that out.

244
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,076
Uh-huh.

245
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,076
You know guys,
Simpson had a dog.

246
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,447
Yeah, that's right. Corky.

247
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,782
- Hey Bud, would you'!
- Yeah, I'll take a look.

248
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,686
Hey, Bud.
Watch your step.

249
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:01,125
Somethin' wanted to get inside
pretty damn bad.

250
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,666
Jeez.

251
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,180
Ugh. What is that from'!

252
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,115
I'm not sure.

253
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,165
Bud:
Corky.

254
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,574
(whistles )

255
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,578
Corky?

256
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,744
Come here, girl.

257
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,334
(whistles )

258
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:18,832
- ( rusting noise)
- Corky!

259
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,049
(whistles )

260
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:30,553
Come on, girl.

261
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,697
Got a nice big bone for ya.

262
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,942
Okay, a big juicy steak.
That's my final offer.

263
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,767
Jesus Christ.

264
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,810
Hand me my forceps.

265
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,691
Is that what I think it is'!

266
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,563
- I've never seen one so--
- ( door opens)

267
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,729
Hey, get a load of this.
Grab this end.

268
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,644
Jesus...

269
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:14,591
I guess we're not gonna
find Corky.

270
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,832
Haemotoxins cause a breakdown
of the blood cells

271
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,930
leading to local bruising
and internal bleeding.

272
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,831
Neurotoxins affect the central
nervous system

273
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,174
especially the part controlling
respiration and the heart.

274
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,605
As much as you got.

275
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:40,199
(thunderclaps -
computer shuts off)

276
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,611
(sighs )
Yep. Perfect.

277
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,049
I said two p.m., guys.

278
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,144
(thunderclaps)

279
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,844
(hissing - screams)

280
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,213
(phone rings)

281
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,687
Where is it'!

282
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,393
(breathing heavily)

283
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,738
- Yeah'!
- Jo, it's me.

284
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,545
Hey.

285
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,980
- Hey.
- Hey thanks.

286
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,354
Power company's got an
a.m./p.m. learning disability.

287
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:16,600
(phone rings)

288
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,033
- Hello?
- Dr. Burns'!

289
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:24,444
- Speaking.
- Phil, City Hospital Pharmacy.

290
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,574
I just received an unusual
antivenin request

291
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,618
that I think you want
to know about.

292
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,312
It's from a town
in close proximity.

293
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,257
This year's hops have a real
unique aroma, flavor, and character,

294
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,421
making the new Fillmore Lager...

295
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,555
Juergy, Juergy, Juergy.

296
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,656
- Juergen.
- You're so cute.

297
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,962
As if I really care
what hops are.

298
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,025
For me. Hops'!
( chuckles )

299
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:51,097
A bunny rabbit hops.
This is not about beer.

300
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,075
This is about,
I know it sounds funny...

301
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,842
it's about image.
Coolness. Prestige.

302
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,510
If you're not drinking
Fillmore Lager you're out.

303
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,450
Passe. Like roller-skates,
record players,

304
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,353
and Riunite on ice.
You know what I mean'!

305
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,322
No. What I know about...

306
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,361
is that this year's brew
is the best it's ever been.

307
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,896
And everyone's going
to know that.

308
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,192
- Juergy.
- Juergen.

309
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,824
Whatever.

310
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,459
This is how it works:

311
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,663
You start with a good product,
which you have.

312
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,502
Yah, we use only the finest
malt, rice, yeast.

313
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,772
Exactly.
You're the hrewmeister.

314
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:31,940
Then you need a consistent
message like...

315
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:35,542
"Fillmore up.
The big-time small-town taste."

316
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,588
Which we will kick off
at this year's festival.

317
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,646
Juer, Juergy.

318
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,623
Thank you.

319
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:46,390
We got these bands.
We got the babes, we got the boys...

320
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,624
we got nationwide coverage.

321
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,601
All you have to worry about
is keepin' the beer flowin'.

322
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,070
It's gonna be huge.

323
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,431
It's not only me
that's counting on this.

324
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,847
(rock music plays throughout)

325
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,564
It's out of the question.

326
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:03,663
But Mayor, this is an extremely
dangerous medical situation.

327
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,105
If we have a problem here,
let's solve it.

328
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,870
Let's not blow it outta
proportion.

329
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,569
It's already out of proportion.

330
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:13,582
Ben, are you tellin' me
we can't handle one stinkin' snake'!

331
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:16,812
Until I know what I'm up
against I can't answer that.

332
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,218
Jesus!

333
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,416
How many snakes did we shoot
when we were kids'! Come on.

334
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,114
You didn't see what this thing
did to Simpson.

335
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,890
And he had an ax in his hand.

336
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,861
Snakebites usually aren't fatal

337
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,556
Tell that to Simpson.

338
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,896
He probably had
an allergic reaction.

339
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,163
He was old, he had a weak heart

340
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,568
which would make him
more affected

341
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,606
by the hemolytic principle
in the venom.

342
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,800
And he lived alone
in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,468
Did you see the size
of this fang'!

344
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,410
The venom disintegrated
half his face.

345
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,846
I saw the body, Brad.

346
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,351
A lot of people got a lot
riding on the future of this brewery.

347
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,649
Including most of us
in this room here.

348
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,747
And if I cancel this festival...

349
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:58,022
Fillmore Lager remains a great
beer that only locals know about.

350
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,893
And it's gonna cost
this town a lotta money.

351
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,694
I got a responsibility to see
that that don't happen.

352
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,636
Mayor, mayor,
with all due respect...

353
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:10,696
people are here now.

354
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:13,675
People who don't know their
way around nature.

355
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,938
City people.

356
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,274
There's a lotta camping gain' on,
a lotta drinkin'...

357
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,976
and we don't know what this
thing is capable of.

358
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,574
Let's send 'em home now.

359
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,244
I won't do that.

360
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,219
At least, let's move it
somewhere safer.

361
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,348
- That's got better crowd control.
- What about Central Avenue'!

362
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,652
Let's make it a street festival.

363
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,715
Yeah, then we can block off
the other streets.

364
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,420
Biddle Park's been the
tradition...

365
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,986
that's why a lotta people
come here.

366
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,532
We're talkin' about
a snake here.

367
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,434
A creature that eats rodents,
small animals and other snakes.

368
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,733
Maybe that's why the crops
are so good this year.

369
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,637
- Because of a monster snake.
- ( knocking at door)

370
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,102
Pardon me for interrupting...

371
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,009
I was told I could find
Dr. Kagen here.

372
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,309
I'm Doctor Kagen.
What can I do for you'!

373
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,975
Dr. Brad Kagen?
I'm Brad Kagen.

374
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,317
- Who are you'!
- I'm Doctor Irwin Burns.

375
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,448
I understand that you have
requested a large amount

376
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,992
of polyvalent antivenin.

377
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:07,188
- You're from City Hospital?
- No. I'm a biochemist.

378
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,994
And what can we do
for you, Dr. Burns'!

379
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,262
(counting in Spanish)

380
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:30,453
( giggling )

381
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,371
- ( hollers )
- (screams )

382
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,863
(rattling heard in distance)

383
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,331
(Speaking Spanish)

384
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,501
(rattling continues)

385
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,074
(rattling nears)

386
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,278
(screaming )

387
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,081
If I can confirm the presence
of these chemicals,

388
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,318
then we'll know for sure
if it was Seth.

389
00:36:57,182 --> 00:37:00,686
Venom entered through a bite
on the lower left calf.

390
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:03,164
We also found traces of venom
in his eyes,

391
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,667
probably causing blindness
prior to death.

392
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,500
I was surprised that he was
able to make it to the house.

393
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,938
There's also two puncture marks
indicating a bite

394
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,378
behind the right ear,
just under the hairline

395
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,312
which I initially missed.

396
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,853
That would account
for the hemorrhaging.

397
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,394
So, uh, what caused the accident?

398
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:37,257
My lack of people skills.

399
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,280
Damn needle in a haystack.

400
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:31,649
( Rattling )

401
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,185
We need a herpetologist.
I know someone.

402
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,421
- You're sure it's him'!
- There's no doubt.

403
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:43,091
The sloughed skin and chemical
compounds confirm it.

404
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,931
Oh, now that we know what
we're dealing with...

405
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,834
I think we should call
City Hospital hack

406
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,497
and get the proper antivenin.

407
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,302
Polyvalent may be insufficient.

408
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:01,345
We gotta find Seth and destroy
him before he kills again.

409
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:07,117
Man:
Nice, very nice.

410
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,955
Confidence.
It's all about confidence.

411
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,962
Pressure to the head.
Steady.

412
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:18,262
- ( Intercom beeps)
- Good.

413
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,597
- Yes'!
- Hash...

414
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,398
you have a very important
phone call.

415
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,235
Thank you.
I'll take it in my office.

416
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:27,435
I gotta take this call, okay'!
You keep working.

417
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,911
Don't get too cocky now.
Expect the unexpected.

418
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,171
- ( Light bulb pops)
- Damn.

419
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,121
Penelope.
(sighs )

420
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,543
( cat screeches)

421
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,081
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

422
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,672
You naughty girl.

423
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,145
Penelope?

424
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,380
(cat toy jingling )

425
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,977
Oh come on,
I wasn't away that long.

426
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,457
Fine, more for me.

427
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,934
( Hissing )

428
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,553
( hisses )

429
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,729
( rattling )

430
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:25,345
(music playing -
crowd cheering)

431
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,620
(music ends - cheering)

432
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,628
This is Eric Anderson
broadcasting from Biddle Park.

433
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,665
We're at the Fillmore
Lager Beer Festival.

434
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,701
We're coming to you
with some crazy people here,

435
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,430
we've got Fumes.

436
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:50,837
(crowd chanting)
Brewfest. Brewfest.

437
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:57,412
(music continues)

438
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,742
Please leave a message.
( beeps )

439
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,110
Dad, you there'!

440
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,740
Burns confirmed that Simpson's
death had to be from his snake.

441
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:35,443
The Mayor's being really
stubborn about this

442
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,179
and I think you're
gonna need to, um...

443
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,743
just give me a call
when you get this.

444
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,290
Hey, hey whoa, guys.
Slow down.

445
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,958
Party's the other way.

446
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,560
Nothin's gain' on around here.

447
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,036
Good night.

448
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,465
Wyatt Earp.
Keeper of the peace.

449
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:00,770
It's a livin'.

450
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,367
Sheriff told me
I'd find you here.

451
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,242
So how's it goin"!

452
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,714
Oh, drunk guys, I can handle.

453
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,614
30 foot snakes,
I don't know about.

454
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,516
Burns called in
a herpetologist.

455
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,680
- A herpewhat'!
- Snake expert.

456
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,086
Supposedly, he's one
of the best.

457
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,386
Should be able to help
you guys out.

458
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,658
Right. Right.
So you're still goin"!

459
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,729
They're expectin' me tomorrow.
I'm already late.

460
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:29,498
Who's gonna administer antivenin
if this thing can't be stopped?

461
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,733
The town doctor, Pat Kagen.

462
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,744
Okay.

463
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,174
So, where's your dad anyway'!
I didn't see him at the festival.

464
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,219
I don't know. I haven't
seen him since this morning.

465
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,413
I left a message for him
on the answering machine.

466
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,081
I go on patrol in about
ten minutes.

467
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,280
If you like, I can
check in on him.

468
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,728
Yeah, I'd appreciate that, Jo.
Thanks.

469
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,457
I gotta go finish packin'.

470
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,702
Yeah, sure Brad.

471
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,842
Dr. Kagen.

472
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,547
DI'. Kaye“?

473
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,994
Pat!

474
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,121
Pat.

475
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:21,300
Pat.

476
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,511
Pat!

477
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:44,864
Pat.

478
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,528
(door creaks open)

479
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,936
- ( cat screeches)
- (screams )

480
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:36,251
Look, we don't know for sure.
Maybe he got away.

481
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,344
Let's not have any
false hopes here.

482
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:42,154
Even if he did get away
the venom would've killed him

483
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:44,284
and we'd have found
his body by now.

484
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,259
I'm sorry.

485
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,264
That's all I can say.
I'm truly sorry.

486
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,095
I'll shut it down now.

487
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,535
(loudspeaker: )
There's no immediate danger.

488
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,130
Repeat, there's no
immediate danger.

489
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,733
I always wanted me a pair
of them snakeskin boots.

490
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,902
From what I hear we could open
a goddamn store.

491
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,367
Let's go kick some ass.

492
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,403
Well sir, the Still's
sighting was here.

493
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,942
The two teenagers
disappeared here.

494
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,206
Simpson's place is here.

495
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:41,410
And the most recent
attack of, uh...

496
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:42,644
...was here.

497
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,579
Okay, and that's all the
attacks you know about?

498
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,351
Yeah. That we know about.

499
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:56,389
Well...

500
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,763
it's pretty clear that he's
marked out his territory.

501
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,566
That's a pretty large area,
my friend.

502
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:05,907
He's a pretty large snake.

503
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:08,701
Dr. Burns...

504
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:13,179
how did you manage to cross
an African King Cobra,

505
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,377
with an Eastern Diamondback
rattlesnake?

506
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,886
Gene splicing.

507
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,923
Gene splicing.

508
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,082
Interesting.

509
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,592
Why would anyone want
to combine

510
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:29,791
two of the most deadly species
of poisonous snakes'!

511
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,667
We wanted the most aggressive
animals possible for testing.

512
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,563
Fascinating.

513
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:38,867
Foolish.

514
00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:40,965
So, how do we get rid of it'!

515
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:42,976
Well, first we have to find it,
of course.

516
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:47,372
I want to make sure that
we all know and respect

517
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,850
exactly what we're
dealing with here.

518
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,786
Respect'!

519
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,286
Yeah, um...

520
00:51:55,346 --> 00:52:00,346
you see in order to overcome
a deadly opponent...

521
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:04,358
you have to learn
to think like it.

522
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,101
I hate snakes.

523
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,261
All right.

524
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,033
Consider, Deputy Fuller...

525
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:15,440
snakes kill in one year
more people

526
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,207
than sharks kill
in 100 years.

527
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:22,543
They are responsible
for more deaths

528
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:29,216
than all the other dangerous
animals in the world combined.

529
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,622
Now that is a power

530
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,955
you have to learn to respect
just a little hit.

531
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:39,957
Let's consider
Ophiophagus Hannah,

532
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,334
0l'I...

533
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:45,397
the African King Cobra.

534
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:53,380
Its venom, a tablespoon,
even dried,

535
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:58,749
could kill 165 people
or 165,000 mice.

536
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,951
Oh, and then there is
Vihoras de Cascaheles.

537
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:07,858
Spanish for rattlesnake.

538
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,035
Rattlesnakes can strike
at ten feet per second.

539
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,232
It has the most highly
developed fangs

540
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:20,240
of all the venomous snakes.

541
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:23,608
Now, my whole point is...

542
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:29,817
as if nature wasn't good enough,
and thanks to science...

543
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:33,651
we now have here...

544
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:38,558
a specimen with all these
beautiful traits.

545
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,144
Come on, Buck!

546
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,890
Over here!

547
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,501
Check it out.

548
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,862
We're gonna need bigger guns.

549
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,339
Hey, hey.

550
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,072
Snakes pick up on vibrations
in the ground.

551
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,547
Okay, so we want to make as
little noise as possible.

552
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,947
But here's the game plan.

553
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,247
We're gonna pound stakes
into the ground,

554
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,618
that's the reason
for the rubber mallet.

555
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:17,625
We're gonna attach the razor
wire to each stake with this wire

556
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,355
and that's the reason
for the cutters and the gloves.

557
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,330
So remember,
work as quietly as you can...

558
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:25,663
look out for anything
that might be moving...

559
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,430
and, um, expect the unexpected.

560
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,983
Is that all you got'!

561
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,961
Yeah. Why?

562
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,989
Don't you have some kind of modern
technology to fight this thing?

563
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,365
These are the tools
of my trade, Brad.

564
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,495
I've been at this for over
25 years.

565
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,232
But this is not an ordinary snake.

566
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:08,504
The methodology for
catching a snake doesn't change.

567
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,011
Besides I've made some
modifications.

568
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,014
Why don't we just shoot
the damn thing?

569
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,886
Sure, let's shoot him,
be my guest.

570
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,685
Go on shoot 'em.
He's that tree over there.

571
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,986
Shoot.

572
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,321
Fine you want me to shoot him'!
I'll shoot that tree.

573
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,124
If you want to kill him
instead of just pissing him off,

574
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:30,461
you're gonna have
to hit him in the head.

575
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:33,263
That's that rock about six
inches off the ground.

576
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:36,100
No, that's not him, there he is
over there, he's that tree.

577
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,502
He's going through the leaves
through the leaves...

578
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,403
there he is at ten o'clock.
Go ahead shoot him, man.

579
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,942
Okay, okay, I got the idea.

580
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,308
You better get it...

581
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,680
because if you don't
you're dead.

582
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,974
Now you're calm right now.

583
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,043
But you see this guy
eyeball to eyeball

584
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,990
your adrenaline is going to
kick in and you will not be calm.

585
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,721
There's probably two people
amongst us here...

586
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,286
okay, maybe one...

587
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,763
that maybe, maybe could get
off a shot...

588
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:07,098
if we get lucky
and if we get a chance.

589
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,232
Believe me, guys...

590
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:17,574
the gun is not the way to go,
at best it's only a backup.

591
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:19,208
You're gonna go up there now'!

592
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,444
Yeah, thought I'd take a look,
check some things out.

593
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:24,611
I'll come with you.

594
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:25,915
No, you'll stay here.

595
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:28,820
What happened to never being
alone in case of a bite'!

596
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,984
You know, I am qualified for that.

597
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:33,255
Ah, I almost forgot, doctor.

598
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:34,887
Can you ride a hike'!

599
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,795
Yeah, I think so.

600
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,799
There's an extra one in there.

601
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:42,493
Why the bikes?

602
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,439
Less vibrations.
Gets you closer to the action.

603
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,998
Besides I ain't
a very good runner.

604
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,805
I'm Japanese.

605
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:53,712
Japanese were not built to run,
we were built to last.

606
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,356
Brad, be careful.

607
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,587
Jo, you there'!

608
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,562
Yeah, Ben, go ahead.

609
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,031
How's it 9°I"9'-'

610
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,431
We're setting up camp.

611
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,730
Brad and Hash went
to take a look around.

612
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,567
Do you guys see anything by you'!

613
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,073
- No sign of it.
- Where are you guys'!

614
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,202
Oh, about a mile past
Canyon Creek.

615
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,144
Gonna head over toward
Jackson farm.

616
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,706
You guys be careful.

617
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:30,547
Yeah, you too.

618
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,360
What is that'!

619
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,853
Shit.

620
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,114
I think it's him.
I think it's him.

621
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:19,888
Jeez.

622
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:28,232
Holy shit.

623
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:33,206
I think it's him.
I think it's him.

624
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,102
Jesus, this sucker's huge.

625
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,920
Son of a bitch.

626
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,583
It's already dead.

627
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,252
Hey, saws!

628
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:58,664
I got 'em.
He's already dead!

629
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,903
( Rattling )

630
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,715
( rattling )

631
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,381
(screaming heard in the distance)

632
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:23,424
Billy.

633
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:26,457
Billy!

634
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,790
Jesse, Conrad!

635
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,665
Jesse, Conrad!

636
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,968
Oh my God, oh ml!-

637
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:43,476
Come on!

638
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,874
- Billy!
' ( Saying )

639
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,646
Billy what happened'!
Did you get bit'!

640
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,812
Billy show me where you're hit.

641
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,254
Get his clothes off
so we can see where he's hit.

642
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:58,385
Jesus Christ, his pulse
is going through the roof.

643
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,018
Get a tourniquet ready!

644
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,163
Billy, hang in there, buddy.

645
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,756
Billy!

646
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,533
Jesus.

647
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,696
Oh shit man, come on,
do something.

648
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:12,933
Try CPR.

649
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,508
He's dead.

650
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,339
No, no he can't,
he can't he...

651
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,037
if we suck the venom out,
he'll be all right.

652
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,239
He's dead, Buck.

653
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,579
No, no, he can't he.
He can't he.

654
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,083
Buck!

655
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,846
God damn it!

656
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,790
It can't be far,
let's go get it.

657
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,061
What about Billy'!

658
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,528
There's nothing we can do
for him now.

659
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,326
We'll come hack for him.

660
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,158
All right, spread out.

661
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:45,468
I wanna get that
son of a bitch.

662
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,936
Oh God.
I don't wanna die.

663
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:52,977
Buck!

664
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,710
Get it together!
Come on.

665
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,347
( Crow caws )

666
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:16,920
( rattling )

667
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,570
Time to die you son of a---

668
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,647
(screams )

669
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:37,484
(screaming heard in distance)

670
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,679
Oh shit, we're screwed,
we're screwed!

671
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,754
Conrad.

672
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,956
Conrad!

673
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,489
( Groaning )

674
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,901
( Saslli?y )

675
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,637
Conrad!

676
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,844
Conrad!

677
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,746
Oh God.

678
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,061
Get out of the way.

679
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,230
Oh shit. Hold still.
Jesse move.

680
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,162
( Hisses )

681
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:44,109
(hisses - loud screech)

682
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,914
They play dead'!

683
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,788
Yeah, like a dog.

684
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,487
Cohras'll do that sometimes
to lure their prey in.

685
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,656
They're very clever.

686
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,939
What is it?

687
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,134
Here, hold this hack.

688
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:14,109
Snake shit.

689
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,276
That's uric acid crystals,
nitrogenous waste.

690
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,717
Snake piss.

691
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,746
It's still pretty fresh.

692
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:25,727
He can't be too far.

693
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,760
What'!
You see something?

694
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,354
Shh!

695
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,331
Someone's coming.

696
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,662
There.

697
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:36,935
That's Buck.

698
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,000
Buck!

699
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:42,504
Buck!

700
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:54,645
Buck. Buck.

701
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:56,552
Buck!

702
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,489
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

703
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,216
What happened'!
What happened'!

704
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,026
What are you, what,
what happened'!

705
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:04,224
Huh?

706
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:05,960
What happened'!

707
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,226
(branches cracking)

708
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:47,672
Oh shit.

709
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,911
Back up slowly...

710
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:57,213
one step at a time.

711
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,952
Calm, calm.

712
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,049
Ben!
Open the door, Ben.

713
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,333
Ben, open the door, man!
Open the damn door.

714
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,531
(loud bang on door)

715
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:18,731
Let's go man!
Let's get the hell out of here!

716
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,899
Will you shut up'!
We're not gain' anywhere.

717
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:22,874
We finally found the damn thing.

718
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:28,108
Okay, buddy boy, respect it,
love it.

719
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,197
Maybe it knocked itself out.

720
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:46,496
(tire flattens )

721
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:48,934
Guess not.

722
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:49,732
I'll be a son of a--

723
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,295
It's popped the damn tires, man!

724
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:53,874
Good deduction, Sherlock.

725
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,580
Where the hell is it, man'!

726
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,742
Tryin' to figure that out.

727
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,881
Maybe it left.

728
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,983
- So go check.
- Are you crazy, man?!

729
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,356
I almost lost my love jones
out there.

730
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,418
I ain't gain' nowhere!

731
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,334
( Rattling )

732
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,483
(Bud screaming)

733
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:48,085
Oh shit.
Come on, baby. Come on.

734
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:50,756
Oh shit.

735
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,966
Blld!

736
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:55,934
Hang in there, Bud.

737
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,630
Blld.

738
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,982
( Hissing )

739
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,535
So, what's in the syringe?

740
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:39,944
Saltwater base with a high
concentration of King Cobra venom.

741
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:43,143
I thought you said a spoonful
would kill a hundred men.

742
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:44,617
Yeah, it would.

743
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,178
But I've been bitten
so many times...

744
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,057
and injected myself with increased
dosages over the years that--

745
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:56,620
That you body's built up the
antibodies to counteract the venom.

746
01:10:56,686 --> 01:11:00,463
Jeez, he's like a walking
supply of antivenin.

747
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,366
Somethin' like that.

748
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,638
(sighs )

749
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,732
You okay?

750
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,207
I'm all right.

751
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,014
How many times you been bit'!

752
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,639
A few times too many.

753
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,124
How often you inject yourself'!

754
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,095
Couple times a month.

755
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:30,631
See, I can't let my
antibodies slide...

756
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:34,260
otherwise I gotta start all
over and build 'em up again.

757
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,929
My blood has saved a few lives
over the years.

758
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,775
When I kick the bucket,
no one will care about my organs,

759
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:45,368
but my blood could be
worth millions.

760
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,776
So what was your worst bite'!

761
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:51,444
Well, none of 'em were
exactly pleasant.

762
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,554
But, this is quite a story.

763
01:11:55,612 --> 01:12:00,220
I was working with
a Black Mamba some years ago...

764
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:01,523
Called him "Sammy".

765
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:09,331
But I got a little too lax
in handling him one day...

766
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:12,430
and uh, Sammy put his fangs
in right here...

767
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:15,942
they went all the way through
and came out here.

768
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,909
Luckily, I kept my head...

769
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:22,074
so I milked Sammy and pulled
him out of my hand

770
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:25,483
without getting too much venom
into the wound.

771
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:30,321
You might even say we were
blood brothers from then on.

772
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,418
He even sends me a card
now and then.

773
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,894
That's amazing, Hash.

774
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:38,296
- Jo, he doesn't really send me--
- Hash, I got it.

775
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,890
I meant the story.

776
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,959
So, uh, Hash, you got a plan
for tomorrow'!

777
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,306
Yep.

778
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,309
Well, enough campfire stories
for tonight, huh'!

779
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,436
I think I'll go relieve Burns.

780
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:59,883
I figured he had a plan.
I was just kinda curious

781
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,014
Yeah, you addressed that point.

782
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:04,217
You do think he has a plan,
don't ya'!

783
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,783
Oh, yeah I'm sure he does.

784
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:12,296
(together)
Yeah, I'm sure he's got one.

785
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,012
That looks good to me.

786
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,683
You think we need more'!

787
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,280
That should do it.

788
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:39,760
Ben, this is Jo, come in.

789
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:44,798
Ben, this is Jo, come in.

790
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,925
Bud, are you guys there'!

791
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,500
I'm really worried about them.

792
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,666
They can take care
of themselves.

793
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,266
I'm sure they're okay.

794
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:17,558
(low pulsating tones)

795
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,130
Wow, that's pretty strong.

796
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,967
Yep.

797
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,041
So now what'!

798
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,110
Well, once we finish
covering it up...

799
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,644
we wait.

800
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,591
How is this supposed
to work again?

801
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,322
The vibrations from
the thumper box

802
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,125
will attract Seth to the area.

803
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,564
Hopefully.

804
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,124
Oh, he'll come.

805
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,399
I designed that box myself,
it always works.

806
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,374
And when he sees the gourmet
meal that we have catered for him...

807
01:15:01,431 --> 01:15:03,104
lunch time begins.

808
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:07,446
Then, while he's digesting...

809
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,245
and becomes a little
sluggish...

810
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:11,876
the show begins.

811
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,281
I'll wrangle him into
the tube...

812
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,416
you guys will seal the tube,
after he's cleared, of course...

813
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,188
and then you lock it in.

814
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:21,626
I'll turn on the gas...

815
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:27,066
and our overgrown elapid
will go night-night forever.

816
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:29,535
Are you certain there's enough
gas in there to kill it'!

817
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:31,367
Absolutely.

818
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:34,101
Well, what if you can't get him
into the tube'!

819
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:36,143
Jo, you guys
hired me for a job.

820
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:38,735
Now you're all gonna have
to trust me.

821
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,074
(cocks rifle)

822
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:42,776
Dr. Burns, come on,
you're not going to need that.

823
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:44,375
Let's hope not.

824
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,800
Maybe it's moved on.

825
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:16,344
Nah, he's out there.

826
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,010
I can feel it.

827
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:20,145
How can you tell'!

828
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,711
Shh.

829
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,076
(bushes rustle - goat bleats)

830
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:50,915
You see it'!

831
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,509
Quite.

832
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:54,580
There.

833
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,917
Jo: Where'!

834
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,117
Shh.

835
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,895
(deep hissing sound)

836
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,589
Jesus, listen to that.

837
01:17:05,488 --> 01:17:06,523
It sounds hungry.

838
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:10,066
Let's hope he likes goat.

839
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,265
Keep it down.

840
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:31,218
Look at the size of him.

841
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:36,025
(hissing - branches snapping)

842
01:17:37,253 --> 01:17:39,392
(goat bleats)

843
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,439
Oh, he's beautiful.

844
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,620
Come on, Seth.

845
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,491
Come on.
Come and get it.

846
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:10,189

847
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,412

( hisses )

849
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:02,812
Come on. Come on.

850
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,111
What's he waiting for'!

851
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:12,053
What the hell are you doing?

852
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,855
I can get him.

853
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:16,989
That's not the plan.

854
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:18,657
I've got a perfect shot.

855
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:20,257
No!

856
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:24,169
- Stop;
- ( glln fires )

857
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,369
What the hell's the matter
with you'!

858
01:19:27,463 --> 01:19:28,703
I had the shot!

859
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:31,142
Shut up, that was not the plan.

860
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,044
Never mind the plan.
It'd be dead by now.

861
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,141
- Bullshit you'da missed!
- Not if you hadn't interfered.

862
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:40,676
- You screwed everything up!
- Your plan wasn't working.

863
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:42,916
( Gun fires )
There's no time for this!

864
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:44,218
Let's just figure out
what to do.

865
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,987
There's nothing to figure out.

866
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:48,255
We gotta find him and get him
into the goddamn tube

867
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:50,661
before he kills us all first.

868
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,329
Look, I had the shot.

869
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,870
Why didn't you just stick
to the plan'!

870
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,496
The plan, as far as
I'm concerned...

871
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:01,098
is to kill it, no matter how.

872
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,609
I had the shot and he knows it.

873
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,447
(breathing heavily)

874
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:01,300
Aaaah!
My thigh!

( Gunshots )

876
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,794
I got him, I got him!
Stay with Burns.

' ( Groaning in pain)

Check his pulse.

894
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:29,912
It's hitting through the roof.

895
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:32,418

Shit!
We'll never make it!

924
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:53,814
Go for that tree,
we'll jam him in.

925
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,081
Go! Push!

926
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,189
Faster.

01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:06,462
Come on, go!

928
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,462

Close the vents and gas him.

(thrashing decreases)

932
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,259

01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:05,792
- ( crashing )
- (startled scream)

934
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:07,918
(soft hiss )

935
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:26,944
What's this?

936
01:28:27,002 --> 01:28:29,073
A little somethin
I got for ya.

937
01:28:31,073 --> 01:28:34,543
You know there's nothin' like
the smell of a good leather hinder.

938
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,489
Except for the smell
of a cadmium lithium battery.

939
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:42,556
I took the liberty of fillin'
in some important dates for ya.

940
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,324
Oh You did, did you?

941

Wow, looks like a busy week.

01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,131
It is.

944
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:59,712
I called Dr. Brown...

945
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,247
and I told him that I had been
offered a better position

946
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,216
somewhere else.

947
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,344
I turned down the hospital job.

948
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:12,487
Are you sure that's what
you want'!

949
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:15,221
I think there's plenty of
excitement right here.

950
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:18,624
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything?

951
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,190
You are, but that's okay.

952
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:28,332
The helicopter'll pick it up
late this afternoon.

953
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,339
Thank God it's over.

954
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,545

955
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:43,486
Are you okay'!

956
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:46,585
It's all right.
It's okay.

957
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:05,635
(helicopter whirring)

958
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:13,547
(rattling heard)

959
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:14,848
(banging from inside)
