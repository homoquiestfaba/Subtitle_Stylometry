1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,500
Oceanic flight 815

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,900
Crashed in the south pacific
on september 22, 2004

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,600
We all gonna be okay,
do you understand me?

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,600
48 people survived
on an forgotten island

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,800
with no hope for rescue

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,600
we think they would gone by now

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,300
and they soon learned

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
this is our island

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
they were not alone

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,000
the only reason you live on it

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,200
is because we let you

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
What if everything

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
That happened here
Happened for a reason?

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,100
I'm one of the survivors
Of flight 815.

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,100
No!
After 108 days...
jin!

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,500
Six people found rescue.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
So we can go off the island?

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,600
But the friends
They left behind...

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,900
he wants us To move the island.

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,600
Vanished.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,000
Where's the island?!

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,900
This is the story
Of the six who came home...

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,100
ladies and gentlemen,
The survivors of oceanic 8-1-5.

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,500
Their experience
as it unfolded...

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
you're being watched.

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,600
And how they came
To realize...

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,700
we made a mistake.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
That destiny was calling.

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,600
Some very bad things happened.

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,400
I think it wants us
To come back.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,200
And everything
That they lived for...

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,600
we're going
On vacation, baby.

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,400
Loved for...

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,200
how do you know he's alive?!

35
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,900
Fought for...
why would they want
To murder her?

36
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,100
And died for...

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,900
he's dead. It's over!

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hung in the balance...

39
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,400
somebody knows we're lying.

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,400
And beckoned them...
we never should've
Left that island.

41
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,400
To return.

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,900
Lost
the story of the oceanic 6

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,100
Are we really going home?

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, we're really going home.

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
The survivors
Of oceanic flight 815

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,900
Believed they'd finally Found rescue 

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
when a freighter Transporting A team
of scientists Arrived near the island.

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,700
But rescue was not
The primary mission.

49
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,500
This is charles widmore,

50
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
The man whose boat
Is parked offshore.

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What does he want?

52
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,100
Charles widmore was
A mysterious and powerful man

53
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,900
And the nemesis Of benjamin linus,
The leader of the others.

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,800
Widmore had been trying To
locate the island for years,

55
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,500
And he staged The recovery of flight 815
To keep anyone else From finding the island.

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,500
Get your ass out here
Right now.

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,400
Another team From
the freighter arrived...

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
with orders to capture ben.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
I'm not coming out
Of this house.

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,100
And in the process,

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,700
Ben's daughter alex
Became a casualty.

62
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,000
So if you want to kill her,
Go ahead and do it.

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
So the survivors made a deal.

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
What was the arrangement?

65
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
They, uh, help us free you,

66
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,700
And we let 'em off the island.

67
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,100
Fair enough.

68
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,800
The helicopter is yours.

69
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,600
You have a safe journey back.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
So we can go off the island?

71
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,900
That's it?

72
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
That's it.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,700
But john locke Believed
their destiny Was on the island.

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,100
If you have to go, 

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,700
then you have To lie
about everything.

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
It's the only way
To protect it.

77
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,800
It's an island, john.

78
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,800
No one needs to protect it.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
It's not an island.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,700
It's a place
Where miracles happen.

81
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,200
Let's go, freckles.

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
I've seen enough of this rock.

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's go for a ride!

84
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,300
Jack, kate, sawyer And their friends
Left for the freighter By chopper,

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,200
As the science team
Took others by boat.

86
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,000
But the chopper
Was leaking fuel...

87
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,100
hey.
So sawyer took action.

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
???

89
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Why are you telling me this?

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Just do it, freckles.

91
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,200
Sawyer!

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,500
Sawyer helped his friends And
made his way Back to the island,

93
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,800
Where locke assumed His new role
As leader of the others.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
Hello, john. Welcome home.

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,600
But with the freighter
Still offshore,

96
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Ben went deep below The orchid
station To move the island

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
So charles widmore Could
never find it again.

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,300
There it is! The boat!
I see it!

99
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
The chopper Reached
the freighter,

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
Only to find that it was
Rigged with explosives.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,800
wait!

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
- It's jin!
- wait for me!

103
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,000
- Turn around!
- We can't do it!

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,700
Jin!

105
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,500
What are you Doing here?

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,100
Decided to take a dip.

107
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,700
What you celebratin'?

108
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm not celebrating.

109
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,100
Is that our boat?

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,300
It was.

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
With the freighter destroyed,
The chopper had no choice 

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,700
But to return to the island.

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Yeah, what is that?

114
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
But the island was gone.

115
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
That's it, people!
We're out of fuel!

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
I can't believe he did it.

117
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,900
He moved the island.

118
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,400
No, he didn't.

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,400
You got another explanation,
Man, i'd love to hear it.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,900
There's a boat out there!

121
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
Hey!

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,900
We're gonna have to lie.

123
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Lie about what?

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Our plane was discovered
On the bottom of the ocean.

125
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,800
Well, someone put it there--

126
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,400
Someone who wants everyone
To think that we're dead.

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
So what do you think's
gonna Happen to us 

128
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
when we tell them That
that wasn't our plane?

129
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,400
What do you think's gonna happen
To the people That we left behind?

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Just let me do the talking.

131
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Throw them a rope!

132
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,000
Penny?

133
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,800
Penny widmore Was
desmond's long-Lost love,

134
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,000
And she'd been searching
For him for over three years.

135
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,300
I love you, penny,

136
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,200
And i'll never
Leave you again.

137
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,900
Onboard penny's boat,

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,800
Jack planned the next move,

139
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,000
While kate focused on aaron,
The son of claire,

140
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,200
An oceanic survivor Who
went missing on the island.

141
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I think we should
say He's mine.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500
After everyone we've lost--

143
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Michael, jin and sawyer...

144
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
i can't lose him, too.

145
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,300
Sawyer's not dead.

146
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
But he's gone.

147
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Kate...

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,400
tomorrow morning, i'm gonna have
To convince everyone to lie.

149
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
Are you with me?

150
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,200
I have always been with you.

151
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Well, are we all
Okay with this? 

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
- Kate?
- Yeah.

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,500
Sun?

154
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
I don't think
We should lie, dude.

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,800
I mean, the island disappeared.
We all saw it. It's gone. Bloop!

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
You think anyone's
Gonna believe that?

157
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,800
We need to protect the people
That we left behind, hurley.

158
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,600
I don't want to spend The
rest of my life lying. Do you?

159
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
No, but 

160
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,000
i don't believe
We have a better choic

161
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,200
And so it began.

162
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Jack and his fellow survivors
Said good-Bye To penny and desmond, 

163
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,300
and began Their
long journey home.

164
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
News of their miraculous
rescue Spread quickly,

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,600
And before they made their way
Back to civilization,

166
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,300
They'd become Instant celebrities.

167
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,700
There's a lot of press
That want to speak to you.

168
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
They're referring to you
As the oceanic six.

169
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,200
The oceanic six
Were finally home,

170
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,200
A moment they never
dreamed Would arri.

171
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
But the life That awaited them

172
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
Was not What they'd hoped for.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And with the world waiting
To hear their story,

174
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,600
The lie was about to begin.

175
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,200
It happened really fast.

176
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,000
I remember the impact,

177
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,200
The plane fiing up with water.

178
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,100
A group of us got To
the emergency door, and, um,

179
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,800
Got out before it went down.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Given The amazing circumstances
Surrounding the survival Of you six,

181
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,600
It is possible there are any
Other survivors from the crash

182
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Yet to be discovered?

183
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
No. Absolutely not.

184
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,600
Mom?

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,100
Hello?

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,900
The survivors Tried
to adjust to a new life,

187
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,100
And for hurley, It seemed the island
had Followed him all the way home.

188
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Surprise!

189
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
Interesting choice of theme.

190
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,500
Yeah, mom really doesn't
Get it, dude.

191
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,500
It was clear That family and friends
Could not begin to understand

192
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,600
What the survivors
Had been through...

193
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,300
hurley grew troubled...
turn around!

194
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,600
When he began having encounters With
oceanic survivors Who died on the island.

195
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Help! Help!

196
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
What the hell
Is wrong with you?

197
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you trying to get tossed
Into the nuthouse?

198
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,700
Because if that's What you want, I can
make that happen Right now, my friend.

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,400
You can? 

200
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you!

201
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,500
But it was becoming clear...

202
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
jack!

203
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,900
The decision to lie
Would always haunt them.

204
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,400
I don't think we did
The right thing, jack.

205
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,800
I think it wants us
To come back.

206
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,600
- Hurley--
- And it's gonna do
Everything it can--

207
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,900
We're never going back!

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Never say never, dude.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,300
The events of the rescue had
An even greater impact on sun.

210
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,400
She was unable to move past
Jin's presumed death

211
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,700
And took out her pain
On her father.

212
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,700
??? two people are responsble
for his death.

213
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
you are one of them.

214
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,700
Without jin, The birth of
her daughter Was bittersweet.

215
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,800
i miss you so much.

216
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,800
But sun's grief

217
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Soon turned to vengeance.

218
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Excuse me. Mr. Widmore?

219
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm sun kwon.

220
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,500
You mentioned
that you and i Had... 

221
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,200
common interests.

222
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,700
Why don't you tell me
Exactly what they might be?

223
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,400
To kill benjamin linus.

224
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,000
The oceanic six Were not the
only people To leave the island.

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,400
After rning the wheel, Benjamin linus
was transported To the tunisian desert,

226
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
10 months in the future,

227
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,200
And it wasn't long Before ben made
contact With the oceanic six.

228
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I just want To bury
my wife in peace.

229
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Mr. Jarrah,

230
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,000
There'a woman outside.
She says she knows you,

231
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,000
But she wasn't on the list
Of family members.

232
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Nadia?

233
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,100
After the rescue, Sayid was
reunited With his long-Lost love.

234
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
But their reunion
Would be short-Lived.

235
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,600
She had been run down
by a car In los angeles,

236
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,100
And ben claimed he had proof
That widmore was responsible.

237
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Why would these people
Want to murder her?

238
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,500
I don't know,
But they did.

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,000
And so an alliance was born.

240
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,400
Sayid became
an assassin For ben,

241
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,100
Exacting ben's vengeance 
from Nadia's death???

242
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,300
Who is next?

243
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,900
Good morning. 

244
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Is this your First time
in the seychelles?

245
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,100
Sayid went on killing...

246
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,700
until there was no one left.

247
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,800
You've taken care Of everyone
who posed A threat to your friends.

248
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,500
It's been a pleasure
Working with you, sayid.

249
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,100
So that's it?

250
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
What do i do now?

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,900
I suppose you should
Go live your life.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're free, sayid.

253
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Shortly after the rescue,

254
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,300
Kate fulfilled the promise...
she made to sawyer On the chopper.

255
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Hey, cassidy.

256
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,200
Oh, my god!
I saw you on the news.

257
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,600
What are you doing here?

258
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,300
Sawyer sent me.

259
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,800
Kate knew cassidy
Before the crash,

260
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,300
But neither were aware
They shared another connection.

261
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,100
What a coward.

262
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
He was trying
To do the right thing.

263
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,700
He was trying
To get away from you.

264
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,300
I told him
He had a daughter.

265
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,000
He never so much as lifted
A finger to try to call her.

266
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,800
So now i'm supposed
To think he's a hero

267
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
Because he told you
To come here and help us?

268
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,100
Hell, i bet this money's
Not even his, is it?

269
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,200
My father Couldn't
stand eulogies.

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,300
"The only good thing About a wake
Is the free booze," he'd say.

271
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,900
For jack, Coming home
provided him The opportunity

272
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,700
To say good-Bye to his father
Christian, who died in sydney.

273
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,600
I loved you. I miss you.

274
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,700
But a visitor from australia
Came to the service

275
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
With shocking news for jack.

276
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,900
My father didn't have
A daughter.

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,600
Yes, he did.

278
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
She was on your plane, Too.

279
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,300
Her name was claire.

280
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,800
Claire's mother was unaware
That aaron was her grandson.

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,400
But jack and kate
Were left stunned.

282
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,200
But when kate was tried For the
murder Of her abusive father...

283
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
the defense calls
Dr. Jack shephard

284
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
To the witness stand.

285
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,200
Jack was there for her.

286
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,200
I only have
one question For you.

287
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,500
Do you love the defendant?

288
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,100
No. 

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
Not anymore.

290
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
The charges against kate
Were dropped.

291
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,900
Hey. I just wanted to tell you
That what i said in there...

292
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
i didn't mean it.

293
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,800
"'And yesterday, Things
went on just as usual.'"

294
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Jack moved in
With kate and aaron.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,500
It seemed that all
were happy-- A family.

296
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,700
I'm so glad
That you're here.

297
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,400
Me, too.

298
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,900
Do you really think

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,700
That i'm good at this?

300
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah.

301
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You're good at this.

302
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,100
Will you marry me?

303
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,200
Of course i will. Yes.

304
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,600
Kate was happy
To begin a new life.

305
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,900
He's refusing to take his meds,
And he's stopped sleeping.

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,500
But hurley's encounters
With dead friends continued,

307
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,800
And one gave him a message
To pass on to jack.

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,500
You're not supposed
To raise him, jack.

309
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Do you think
he means aaron?

310
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,600
Take your meds, hurley.

311
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,500
Just take 'em.

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey, jack?

313
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Charlie said someone's
Gonna be visiting you, too.

314
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Soon.

315
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
Jack slowly began
To lose control...

316
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,400
jack?

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
And for good reason--

318
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,000
He saw his dead father.

319
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,100
Jack began drinking
And taking pills.

320
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,500
And to make matters worse...

321
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
i gotta go. Jack's home.

322
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
He stopped trusting kate.

323
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,600
Why won't you tell me?

324
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,600
Because he wouldn't
Want me to.

325
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,800
The promise she made to sawyer
Was coming between them

326
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,500
And ultimately brought
Their relationship to an end.

327
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm the one who saved you.

328
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
You can't do this. All right? 

329
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,200
'Cause i can't have You
like this around my son.

330
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,300
You're not even
Related to him!

331
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,400
What was this thing
Before you guys blew it up?

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,900
A dharma station.

333
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,900
For what?

334
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,700
There was a man named
desmond Living down in it.

335
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,300
He was pushing a button every
108 minutes to save the world.

336
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,100
- Really?
- Really.

337
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,200
The survivors left behind
On the island...

338
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,900
son of a...

339
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,800
found themselves In an
extraordinary situation.

340
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,500
Bitch.

341
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,100
When ben turned the wheel Below
the orchid station To move the island,

342
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
It caused
A serious side effect.

343
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,500
Oh, no!

344
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,200
The oceanic survivors And
the scientists From the freighter

345
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
Began flashing through time.

346
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Whatever ben linus did,
I think dislodged us.

347
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
Dislodged us from what?

348
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,200
Time.

349
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
They flashed to numerous
Time periods on the island

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And met the others
In the 1950s.

351
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Your name is widmore?

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,300
Charles widmore?

353
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
What's it to you?

354
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Charlotte?
But the flashes...

355
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,000

356
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,000
Charlotte!
Were slowly killing them.

357
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,900
Daniel faraday Knew
the situation was serious.

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Please let this work.

359
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,900
But he had an idea
How he might find help.

360
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,700
Oh! Oh! Whoa. Whoa.

361
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,200
Do i know you?

362
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,600
Desmond, my name is
Daniel faraday.

363
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,300
I need you to go back
To oxford.

364
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,900
I need you to go there
and find My mother. 

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,100
Her name is--

366
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Desmond?

367
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,100
We're leavin'.

368
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,800
Leaving to go where?

369
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,200
Oxford.

370
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Desmond's search
For faraday's mother

371
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,100
Uncovered clues that led him Directly
to a confrontation With charles widmore.

372
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
I need to know where i can
Find daniel faraday's mother.

373
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Haven't seen or heard from
My daughter for three years.

374
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Just answer me this--

375
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,500
Is she safe?

376
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,700
Where's faraday's mother?

377
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
She's in los angeles.

378
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,200
But on the island,
The flashes continued.

379
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,900
What's going on?!

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Turn around slowly.

381
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
- Jin?
- Sawyer?

382
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Jin!

383
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,100
Jin survived The
freighter explosion

384
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,300
And had been flashing
Through time as well.

385
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Where is sun?

386
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
Hey, john.

387
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,500
Richard Alpert found locke 

388
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,700
And told him the only way
To stop the flashes

389
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,200
Was to bring back those
Who'd left the island.

390
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,200
How am i supposed
To do that?

391
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,500
You're gonna
Have to die, john.

392
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,300
We have to go Back
to the orchid.

393
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Excuse me?

394
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,200
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

395
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,500
Locke returned to the location
Of the orchid station.

396
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,600
Aah!

397
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Aah!

398
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
Hello, john.

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,100
What are you doing down here?

400
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm here to help you
The rest of the way.

401
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,100
And he turned the same
wheel That ben turned.

402
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Say hello to my son.

403
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
In the process,
The time flashes stopped.

404
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,900
I think it's over.
I think john did it.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,700
Now what?

406
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,100
Now we wait for him
To come back.

407
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
But sawyer and his group were
Left stranded on the island

408
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,800
In 1974,

409
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
And they had no choice
But to join The dharma initiative.

410
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Locke was transported Three years
into the future... to the tunisian desert,

411
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
Where he was soon found By men
working For charles widmore.

412
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,900
I met you when i was 17.

413
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,600
How long has it been for you
Since we first met?

414
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Four days.

415
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
That's incredible.

416
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Widmore wanted
To find the island,

417
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,900
So he helped locke
In any way he could.

418
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,800
The folder contains
Your people's whereabouts--

419
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,700
Everyone that was
On the island that left.

420
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
Mira. Tienes un visitante.

421
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
But locke's task Would
prove to be difficult.

422
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,100
I know how it sounds, sayid,
But you have to trust me.

423
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm not going back.

424
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
Hello, hugo.

425
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Hey, susie, Am i talking to
a dude In a wheelchair right now?

426
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,400
Yep.

427
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Whoa, dude!

428
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,900
I need you to come back
To the island with me.

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,100
- What?
- And not just you,
But everybody who left.

430
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,100
No, i'm not going
Anywhere with you!

431
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,100
Kate, i don't think
You understand--

432
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
No, you made yourself
Perfectly clear,

433
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,300
And the answer is no.

434
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Locke grew discouraged,

435
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
But his situation
Soon became dangerous.

436
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,900
This turn of fate Gave locke
another chance To prove his case.

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
What are you doing here?

438
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,500
We have to go back.

439
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,100
Of course we do.

440
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Jack, the people i left
behind Need our help.

441
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,700
We're supposed to go back.

442
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,100
Because it's our destiny.

443
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,600
How many times are you gonna
Say that to me, john?

444
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
Good-Bye, john.

445
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,100
Your father says hello.

446
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,000
- What?
- The man who told me how
To bring you all back--

447
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,800
He said to tell His son hello.

448
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,100
He said his name
Was christian.

449
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
My father is dead.

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,300
He didn't look dead to me.

451
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,100
You leave me alone,

452
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,200
And you leave
The rest of 'em alone!

453
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,800
Locke had failed,

454
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,000
And for him,
There was only one option.

455
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Wait, please. John, stop!

456
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
- What-- What are you doing here?
- John, just calm down.

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
- What do you want from me?
- Please, let me help.

458
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
- Answer the question!
- I'm trying to protect you!

459
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,600
No! Widmore came to me.

460
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,900
- He saved me.
- No, john, he used you.

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
Charles widmore is the reason
I moved the island--

462
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,200
To keep him away
So that you could lead.

463
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,600
I can't lead anyone.
I couldn't get any of them.

464
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,100
I couldn't get a single one
Of them to come back with me.

465
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
- Jack booked a ticket.
- What?

466
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,800
A plane ticket from los angeles
To sydney-- Tonight.

467
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Whatever you said to him,
John, it worked.

468
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,500
And if you got jack,

469
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
You can get The rest of them.

470
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,400
I know we can do this, John.

471
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,700
You haven't even Been to sun yet.
Let's start with her.

472
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,100
I promised jin that
I wouldn't bring her back.

473
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
Jin is alive?

474
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,400
He wanted me to tell her that
His body washed up on the beach.

475
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
He gave me his wedding ring To prove it.

476
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,000
All right.

477
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,100
I don't know Where we go from there,
But we'll Figure something out.

478
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,200
I know where we go.

479
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,500
There's a woman Here
in los angeles-- Eloise hawking.

480
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,400
Eloise hawking?
Are you sure?

481
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah, why?
Do you know her?

482
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Yes, john.
I know her.

483
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
Aah!

484
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,500
I'll miss you, john.
I really will.

485
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,100
Jack began taking frequent
Trips across the pacific...

486
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,100
excuse me. Can i get Another
one of those, please?

487
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,100
How about A newspaper instead?

488
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,000
And during one flight home,

489
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,500
He learned that locke was dead.

490
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,300
For the first time, Jack reazed that
he and locke Need one another...

491
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,900
and their ultimate destiny
Was on the island.

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
- Hello?
- It's me.

493
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,600
I just need to see you.

494
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Why did you call me, jack?

495
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Been flying a lot.

496
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
Why?

497
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,300
Because i want it
To crash, kate.

498
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,000
I actually close my eyes,

499
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
And i pray
That i can get back.

500
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,000
I have to go.

501
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,100
We were not supposed To leave.

502
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,700
Yes, we were.

503
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Good-Bye, jack.

504
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,200
We have to go back, kate.

505
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,200
"We have to go back"?

506
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I spent the last three years

507
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,300
Trying to forget All of the horrible things
That happened On the day that we left.

508
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
How dare you ask
me to go back?

509
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,700
But jack wouldn't let go,

510
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,900
And he soon found
An unlikely ally.

511
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
Heo, jack.

512
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,300
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.

513
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,000
Did he tell you that
i was off the island?

514
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,600
Yes, he did.

515
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,300
He told me...

516
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,400
that after I left the island,

517
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,000
Some very bad things Happened,

518
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
And he said that
I had to come back.

519
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm here to tell you That the island
Won't let you come alone.

520
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,200
All of you have to go back.

521
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
We're gonna have
To bring him, too.

522
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,300
Sayid had no intention
Of returning to the island.

523
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,800
But with locke dead, He was serious
about Protecting his friends.

524
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,800
- I want you to come with me.
- We're not going back, are we?

525
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,900
No.

526
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,300
Just somewhere safe.
Wait here.

527
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Hey, he's got a gun!
Come on! Get out of here!

528
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,300
I thought it was supposed
To be a safe house.

529
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,600
Jack found new purpose

530
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,500
And joined ben To convince
his friends To return to the island.

531
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,300
Okay, let's go get 'em.

532
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
Police have now identified Hugo reyes...

533
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
but their task Had
become more difficult.

534
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,200
...member of The infamous oceanic six.

535
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,700
Looks like we have
A change of plan.

536
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,000
Jack brought sayid To the hospital
And was able to revive him.

537
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,200
All right. Sayid, you've been attacked.

538
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,800
Where is hurley?

539
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,900
At his parents' house.

540
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,500
- Hello, hugo.
- Aah!

541
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
- Get away from me.
- Hugo, I know you're in trouble.

542
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I have a car Waiting
fous out back.

543
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
- No way, dude.
- We all want the same thing--

544
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
To go back to the island.

545
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,600
If you come with me,
You won't ever Have to lie again.

546
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
- Let me help you.
- Never, dude.

547
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Hey, you got me!

548
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,700
That's right! You got me!
That's right!

549
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
I killed 'em.
I killed 'em all.

550
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,800
Just get me away from here.

551
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,800
Ben's plan was in jeopardy.

552
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,800
Hello. Who's there?

553
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,100
But kate's problems
Were just beginning.

554
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
You have to go back.

555
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
Don't move.

556
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't you touch my son!

557
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,800
Claire?

558
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,000
You can't bring him back, Kate.

559
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,600
Don't you dare
Bring him back!

560
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,800
And her fears...

561
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,800
were soon valited.

562
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,700
Miss austen? We're here to
get A blood sample from you

563
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
And one from your son aaron.

564
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Why?

565
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,900
To determine your relationship
To the child.

566
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,400
- Please, may we come in?
- Get off my property.

567
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,800
If you won't comply,

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
Then i'm going to have to
come back with the sheriff.

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
Then come back
With the sheriff.

570
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,700
The possibility of losing aaron
had become a reality for kate.

571
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,200
And as she set out To find answers,
Jack was there to help.

572
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Somebody wants aaron.

573
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
What?

574
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,000
There's a lawyer in there.

575
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
His clients--
They know we're lying,

576
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,700
And they're gonna Take him away.

577
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
Look, i gotta go, all right?
Get in or don't.

578
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,200
The path led them To a motel room
Occupied by claire's mother...

579
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,300
oh, my god.

580
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,700
Who was presumably in l.A.
To take her grandson Away from kate.

581
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,500
So jack made an appeal.

582
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,800
Ms. Littleton,

583
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,400
i understand that You
feel the need to do this.

584
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,900
But i need you to know

585
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,300
That everything that
Kate and i have done,

586
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,100
It was for aaron.

587
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,900
Who's aaron?

588
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,300
It was clear That claire's
mother Was not after aaron.

589
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,500
But that night,
Kate would learn who was. 

590
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,800
Hello, kate. It's okay .

591
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,800
- He's with me.
- He's with you?

592
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,000
He's here to help us, To help
everyone That we left behind.

593
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,400
It's him-- He's the one
Who's trying to take aaron.

594
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,300
- No, you-- You don't understand.
- No, jack, she's right.

595
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Sun was ready

596
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
To exact the revenge She
long sought For jin's death.

597
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,600
Who the hell Do
you think you are?

598
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,700
Why don't you leave me
And my son alone?

599
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Because he's Not your son, kate.

600
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,500
- Move away, kate.
- Sun, what are you doing?

601
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,200
- Sun--
- I said move away!

602
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,700
Sun, listen. I know
You think you're helping--

603
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,700
If it wasn't for you,
Jin would still be alive.

604
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,400
I didn't kill your husband,
Sun, because he's not dead.

605
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,300
- You're lying.
- No, sun.

606
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
How do you know he's alive?!

607
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,700
There's someone Here in los angeles.

608
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,900
Let me take you to them,
And i'll show you the proof.

609
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,600
Someone? Who?

610
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,600
The same person That's gonna show us
How to get back to the island.

611
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
Is that what this is about?

612
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,100
This is insane.
You guys are crazy.

613
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,300
- Kate--
- Jack, don't!

614
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,300
Sayid, where are you going?

615
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
I don't want any part of this.
And if i see you or him again...

616
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,400
it'll be extremely
Unpleasant for all of us.

617
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,400
What's a glass
Of that run you?

618
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,100
Whatever it is,
It's worth it.

619
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,300
I don't understand why Someone would
pay 120 bucks For a glass of anything.

620
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,200
If you knew what my drink cost,
Why did you ask me?

621
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,200
You so much as flinch
And you're dead.

622
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
I was hired To
bring you to guam.

623
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,400
Who hired you?

624
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,400
The family of peter avellino--

625
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,000
The man you killed in cold blood Last year
on a golf course In the seychelles.

626
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,500
You're going to answer
For what you've done.

627
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Take it.

628
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
Before ben brought jack
And sun to eloise hawking,

629
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,100
He provided sun with
proof That jin was alive.

630
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,800
John gave it to me.

631
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,500
Why didn't locke
Tell me himself?

632
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,200
I don't know, but all those
People back on the island,

633
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,600
Jin included,
Need our help.

634
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,600
Will you come with me?

635
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
Yes.

636
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,100
What are you doing here?

637
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
I assume The same thing you are.

638
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,800
You're looking For
faraday's mother, too?

639
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,700
Eloise hawking was
Daniel faraday's mother

640
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
And the person who knew How to get
the oceanic six Back to the island.

641
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,500
What is this place?

642
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
The dharma initiative
Called the lamp post.

643
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,600
This is how they
Found the island.

644
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,500
She explained that The
island was always moving.

645
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,100
Consequently, the group Had a very small

646
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,600
There's a commercial airliner
Flying from l.A. To guam--

647
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,400
Ajira airways flight 3-1-6.

648
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
It must be that plane.

649
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,100
Excuse me.
Am i really hearing this?

650
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,400
You're all going back
To the island? Willingly?

651
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,400
Yes.

652
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,700
I came here
To deliver a message.

653
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,700
Daniel faraday sent me here.

654
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,500
He wanted me to tell you That he
and all the people On the island 

655
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
need your help.

656
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,100
But i am helping, dear.

657
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,500
Consider the message Delivered.

658
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,900
So that's it.

659
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,400
We just get on that flight,

660
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,900
And we just pe that it works?

661
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
No, that's not all, jack.

662
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,400
What's this?

663
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,400
It's john locke's Suicide note.

664
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
He is going to heLp you get back.

665
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
John is going To be a substitute.

666
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,700
A substitute for who?

667
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,000
You need to, As best you can,

668
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,900
Recreate the conditions
Of the original flight,

669
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,600
Which is why you need to give
John something of your father's.

670
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,900
- That's what you have to do.
- This is ridiculous.

671
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,800
Oh, stop thinking
ow ridiculous it is

672
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,900
And start asking yourself

673
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,100
wether or not you believe
it's going to work.

674
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Jack was not Entirely comfortable
Taking such a leap of faith.

675
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
But when he paid A visit
to his grandfather,

676
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,600
He made a timely discovery.

677
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,000
- Are these yours, granddad?
- Those were your father's.

678
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
For kate, A return to the island Was
the furthest thing From her mind.

679
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Aaron? Aaron? Aaron!

680
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,800
But when she nearly lost
Aaron in a supermarket,

681
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,800
Is this your mommy?

682
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,800
She began to question If she was
the right person To be his mother.

683
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,600
As scared as i was,
All i could think was,

684
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,200
It's about time.

685
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
I mean, why would i
Expect him to be taken?

686
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,300
Because you took him, kate.

687
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
I had to take him.
He needed me.

688
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
You need him.

689
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,600
Sawy broke your heart.

690
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
How else were you
Supposed to fix it?

691
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Mrs. Littleton,
I'm kate austen.

692
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,400
I know who you are.

693
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,300
Though it was the hardest
Decision of her life,

694
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,400
Kate knew what
needed To be done.

695
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,400
He's waiting for you.

696
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,200
I told him That
you're his grandmother,

697
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,400
That you'll take care
of him While i'm gone

698
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
And that i'll be back soon.

699
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,300
Where are you going?

700
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,900
I'm going back

He's a monster responsible
For nothing short of genocide.

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,100
Why would i work
For somebody like that?

770
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400

Which part?

778
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,000
You don't think It means
something That somehow

779
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,500
We're all back together?

780
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,300
We're on the same plane, Jack.

781
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,900
Good afternoon,
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,800
It seemed that destiny Was calling
this group Back to the island,

793
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,100
And jack could only hope
This leap of faith

794

795
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,200

Dude?

799
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
You might want To

I have the controls.

801
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,300
Is that a runway?

802
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,500
Massive instrument failure!
We're putting her down!

803
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,600

I don't know.

811
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,500
But in two very different Time periods...

812
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,600
where's everyone else?

813
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,100
With one group in 2007...

814
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,500

815
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,400
They're gone.

816
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,400

Just meet me In the north valley.

827
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,700

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,600
You, too, james.

837
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600
So what's up with you guys
In the old dharma jumpsuits?

838
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,100
We're in The dharma initiative.

839
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,000
They came back To the island?

840
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,000
No. We came back,

841
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
And so did you.

842
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,800
It's 1977.

843
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
All right, listen,

844
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,000
You're all gonna be The second batch of recruits
Coming in off a sub rolling Into port right about now.

845
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,300
So we ain't got much time.

846
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,500
You want us to say We came in
on the sub? How's that gonna work?

847
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
Everyone gets knocked
out Before the trip,

848
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
So no one meets each other
Until we process 'em.

849
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
Your name's gonna be On the list.

850
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,600
So when you get in there,
Just wait for 'e To call your name.

851
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
When they do,
just smile, Step up,

852
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,300
take your jumpsuits
And work assignments.

853
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,800
Okay, ready?

854
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,500
Everybody say,
"namaste."

855
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,500
Namaste.

856
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
30 years in the future,

857
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,200

A mystery of their own.
