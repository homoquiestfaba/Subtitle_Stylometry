1
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:11,574
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:28,528
(hip hop music)

3
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,952
(laughing)

4
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,335
- You lying man.

5
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,283
- Right hand to God,

6
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,661
I cannot make this up.

7
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,516
- So you telling me you ain't hit,

8
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,111
(laughs) because-

9
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,403
- What you mean?

10
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:04,104
Because me and the Nates
told them I came across

11
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,503
to have way more important
stuff to talk about.

12
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,082
(laughs)

13
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,391
You laughing, but I'm telling you

14
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,441
your boy was in a tough spot that night.

15
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,259
- Why didn't you just get up
and go to the bathroom, man?

16
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:19,732
- What? You trippin' man.

17
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:21,161
I'm not about to use
it at the girl's house.

18
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,022
I just had met her too.

19
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,427
- What?

20
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,816
Bro, I don't care where I'm at,

21
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:28,978
that's how I know if a girl
really down for me or not.

22
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:30,995
- Oh yeah, that's how, huh?

23
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:32,837
- Hell yeah.

24
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:33,726
You better ask Trish.

25
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:36,935
- (laughs) Whatever, bro.

26
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:37,932
Let me hit that one more time.

27
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:39,726
You trippin'.

28
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,057
Ask Trish.

29
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:42,057
- Hey, ask her man.

30
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,022
(laughs)

31
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:49,969
You ready?

32
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:51,847
- Yeah, are you ready?

33
00:02:51,897 --> 00:02:52,813
- Let's go.

34
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,967
Still can't believe you ate that.

35
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:08,372
- I can't believe I ate that.

36
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,923
My stomach's turning
just thinking about that.

37
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,610
- You'd be better off getting Taco Bell.

38
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,910
- Man, I don't even need
to eat none of that.

39
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,922
- All right, man, no boo
booing yourself here, man.

40
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:23,045
- Get out.

41
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:23,878
This the one right here?

42
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:24,711
- No, the next one.

43
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,677
- Next one.

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,633
Oh man.

45
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,706
- You good, dog?

46
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:33,373
- Do I look good?

47
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,339
- Come on, man, I need you with me.

48
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,422
- Right here?

49
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:40,629
- Yeah.

50
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,587
(hip hop music)

51
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:08,904
(laughing)

52
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:10,108
- Oh, is that right?

53
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:11,154
- Yeah, that's right.

54
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,196
I don't know why you acting like that,

55
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,278
you know you feeling me too.

56
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:15,111
- I don't know,

57
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,023
maybe because I just saw you
trying to talk to my girl.

58
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:20,234
- That was me trying
to get your attention.

59
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:21,524
- Really?

60
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:23,064
- It worked didn't it?

61
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:24,149
- You think so?

62
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,107
- You're sitting right here with me.

63
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:27,989
- I guess.

64
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:33,506
- Hey look, why don't we go upstairs?

65
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,066
- Oh, I know you don't think

66
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,626
it's about to go down like that.

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,602
- Of course not,

68
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm just trying to get to
know you a little better,

69
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,723
more privately.

70
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,298
(knocking on door)

71
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:49,181
Hold on, baby.

72
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,233
- Whoa! Everybody chill out.

73
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:06,259
- He said chill out.

74
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,726
(gun firing)

75
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:15,359
- All right. This look
like my kind of party.

76
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,229
- I was gonna invite y'all, man, I swear.

77
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,111
- Invite, huh?

78
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:29,884
Boy, we the ones who sponsoring it.

79
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:40,011
- Come on now, Frank, I
don't want your guests think

80
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,160
we're no type of party poopers or nothing,

81
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:47,203
so just as soon as you get us our money,

82
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:49,645
the sooner you can get
back to your little party.

83
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,364
Why you still standing there, Frank?

84
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,162
See that was your cue, Frank.

85
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:09,051
This the part where you're supposed to say

86
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:12,970
okay no problem, better you
let me go get that for y'all.

87
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,191
- See, what happened was-

88
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,158
- Shh, shh.

89
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,687
- You just don't learn, do you, Frank?

90
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,306
- Ladies and gentleman,

91
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,545
sorry to break up y'all party.

92
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,482
Why don't y'all continue to get high,

93
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,204
courtesy of yours truly,

94
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,480
and whatever else it leads
you to as the night continues.

95
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,835
We just gonna borrow our
pal Frank here for a second.

96
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,734
Sure nobody got a problem with that right?

97
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,936
- Take him.

98
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:43,640
- I didn't think so.

99
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,789
- I mean we are pretty covered right here.

100
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,498
I mean I'd hate to have to
come borrow one of y'all

101
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:50,717
from y'all jobs

102
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:53,789
or y'all homes.

103
00:06:56,475 --> 00:07:00,644
I kind of think you get where
we going with this, right?

104
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:11,017
- [Frank] Y'all ain't go to do this, man.

105
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:24,545
Come on, man, y'all
ain't got to do this man.

106
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,844
(coughing)

107
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:34,335
Deante, Larry, y'all
ain't gotta do this man,

108
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:36,152
I can get y'all your money tomorrow.

109
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:39,191
- Frank, this the third time

110
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,383
you promised us our money tomorrow.

111
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,539
So it's cool, you keep it.

112
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,005
(gun firing)

113
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:51,705
- Yo, what are you doing?

114
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:52,587
- What?

115
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:54,935
- You killed him.

116
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,518
- 'Cause that's how I go.

117
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,354
- Since when?

118
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:00,497
- Since now, Tey.

119
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,173
Look, if we gonna take
over like we said we was,

120
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:06,132
then people gotta fear us man.

121
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,551
They need to know that
if anybody steal from us

122
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,900
it's gonna be consequences
behind all of that.

123
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:14,059
- So what we're just killers now?

124
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:18,770
- No, Deante, we drug
dealers that mean business.

125
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,906
So is you gonna keep going back and forth

126
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:23,266
with me about this,

127
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,625
or is you gonna help
me get rid of this body

128
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,775
before somebody come down here and see us?

129
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,193
Get your head in the game, Tey.

130
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:34,436
- Man.

131
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,235
- Well, come on, man.

132
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,765
- (singing) This little light of mine

133
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:52,892
I'm gonna let it shine

134
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:55,024
This little light of mine

135
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,149
I'm gonna let it shine

136
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,303
This little light of mine

137
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,967
- [Deante] Grandma Tee.

138
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,968
- In the kitchen.

139
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:08,018
Let it shine

140
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,710
Let it shine

141
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,967
Let it shine

142
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:13,989
- What up though, Grandma Tee?

143
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,391
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

144
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,819
- So what's good with you?

145
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:25,015
- Don't be bringing that
slang up in my kitchen, okay?

146
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,165
- I'm sorry.

147
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:27,847
How are you, Grandma Tee?

148
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:29,027
Is that better?

149
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,833
- Don't be getting smart with me either,

150
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:36,102
coming in here smelling like marijuana.

151
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:39,460
Anyway, what you doing here?

152
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,169
What do you want? What do you need?

153
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:44,579
- Now why do I have to
need something, huh?

154
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:47,128
I'm just dropping by,
checking on you like always.

155
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,137
You okay?

156
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,060
- I'm fine.

157
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,506
Every day I wake up I'm fine.

158
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:54,388
Glory.

159
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,314
- You know, one day

160
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,633
I'm gonna get a different
answer out of you, right?

161
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,233
- Well what you want me to say?

162
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,752
This arthritis is kicking my behind,

163
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,923
or my carpal tunnel is killing me.

164
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,459
- I mean, is it?

165
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,870
- Well, yeah.

166
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,808
But there ain't nothing
you can do about it

167
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,927
but just worry yourself to death.

168
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,317
Nothing I could do about it either

169
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:23,376
but just pray on it, and keep it moving.

170
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:28,952
You want some of these eggs and sausage?

171
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,334
- You know I do.

172
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,157
- Go on in there and have a
seat so I can fix you a plate.

173
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:36,740
- All right.

174
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,872
- Mhm. That's what I'm talking about.

175
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:45,328
Mm-hmm.

176
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,275
Here you go.

177
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,325
- Thank you.

178
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:55,828
- Now, the question is, how you doing?

179
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,397
Are you still unemployed?

180
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,852
- Now you say that like I'm
actually looking for a job

181
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,462
but can't find one.

182
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,191
I told you I'm licking
this unemployment game

183
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,341
until I can't no more.

184
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,720
- And I keep telling you

185
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,792
that don't no good woman
want an unemployed man.

186
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:20,606
Deante, I'm gonna need you
to get on out the streets,

187
00:11:21,086 --> 00:11:23,535
'cause you too old to be
out there chasing women.

188
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,864
I'm gonna need you to get it right,

189
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,233
and get married so I can finally

190
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:33,679
have the granddaughter I always wanted.

191
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,310
- Come on, grandma, you
know I got a girl already.

192
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,041
- I said woman.

193
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,049
Ain't nobody talking
about that ghetto thing

194
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,221
you go out with. Hmm.

195
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,990
- Can we not call her thing, please?

196
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:51,796
- Well, baby, the truth hurt, don't it?

197
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,198
I keep telling you

198
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:55,867
you need a good church girl.

199
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,563
And speaking of church,

200
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,782
I'm getting ready to go to
a church community cleanup,

201
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:05,284
it would be so nice if you'd come along.

202
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,957
- Um you know I would,

203
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,852
but I got stuff I gotta do today.

204
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:15,015
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:17,277
- But next time.

206
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:18,677
Next time, I promise, okay.

207
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:26,297
I love you, though.

208
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:27,657
- I love you too.

209
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,093
Lord knows that boy need a job.

210
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,905
- Oh, oh, this is nothing but God here,

211
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:55,317
I gotta take a picture of this.

212
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,817
- Oh my goodness.

213
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,981
Dad, you are being so extra right now.

214
00:12:59,031 --> 00:12:59,814
- Extra?

215
00:12:59,864 --> 00:13:00,646
How am I being extra?

216
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,932
Ooh, I wish your mama
was here to see this.

217
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,441
Hey, your room used to
look like a tornado hit it,

218
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:07,540
and that was after you cleaned it up.

219
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,676
- Well people change, you know?

220
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:13,979
You always try to embarrass me.

221
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,811
- I'm just saying. (laughing)

222
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,520
I just like to see you cleaning up.

223
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,979
I'm gonna help you, okay?

224
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,850
I still got a good picture though.

225
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,727
- Hey.

226
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:24,559
- Hey, Pastor.

227
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:25,432
- Steven, Tiffany.

228
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:26,265
- Hey.

229
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:27,098
- How we doing today?

230
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,926
- Good. Hey, as a matter
of fact we're awesome.

231
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,469
- Hi, Pastor (indistinct).

232
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,802
Please don't make...

233
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,471
- Again, huh?

234
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,560
- Listen, I just wanted to thank you both

235
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,702
for being here this Saturday.

236
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:45,097
You know, I grew up in this neighborhood

237
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:51,525
and to see it get some TLC,
I just really appreciate it.

238
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:53,799
- It's no problem.

239
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,257
- Happy to help, Pas.
That's why we're here.

240
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,792
- Is that it? (chuckles)

241
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,254
Well I'm glad you said that,

242
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,661
'cause I've been meaning to
talk to you about something.

243
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:04,821
Tiffany, sweetheart,

244
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,270
mind if I borrow your father for a second?

245
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,429
- Not at all. Take him. Far, far away.

246
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:20,975
- What's goin' on, Pas?

247
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:21,858
- Well.

248
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,196
Been thinkin' about
something for a while now.

249
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:31,512
How do you feel about leading

250
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:33,011
a different type of ministry?

251
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:37,620
- Pastor, I'm... like, all due respect,

252
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,088
like I'm, like I only got
one foot in the church.

253
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,927
And it ain't even a foot,
it's more like a toe.

254
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:47,296
Like I told you, the only
reason I came to this church

255
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,066
was to be a better father for Tiffany

256
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,006
once her mom passed.

257
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,715
I'm not, I'm not tryin' to be

258
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,204
this holier than thou say person.

259
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:57,653
And I'm definitely not
ready to lead a ministry.

260
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,311
- So I remember you
tellin' me those things,

261
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,429
and I also remember the day
that you came into my office

262
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,729
and you broke down and
you cried like a baby.

263
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:18,976
And how you see it, you knew
that it was only God's grace

264
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,975
that you're still here breathing today.

265
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:23,475
Ah, nope.

266
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:24,308
- Pastor, I...

267
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,803
- Mm mm.

268
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,643
And how it took those three bullets in you

269
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,772
for you to realize

270
00:15:28,822 --> 00:15:31,105
that you just had enough of those streets.

271
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,330
Do you remember that?

272
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,129
- Yeah.

273
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,981
- Listen. So simply, help
other realize the same Steven.

274
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,263
Can you do that for me?

275
00:15:54,474 --> 00:15:55,257
- Yeah.

276
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:58,133
- Okay then. Meet me here
tomorrow night at six pm.

277
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,632
And I'll show you exactly
what I'm talking about.

278
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,257
All right? All right, God bless you.

279
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:12,988
- The funny thing about my scars

280
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,157
is that they were self-inflicted.

281
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:18,629
Caused by my pursuit of the
thing I wanted most in life,

282
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:21,055
you.

283
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,164
- See? Uh uh, she way too calm.

284
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:25,163
Let me come over here

285
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:25,996
and find you in here with another chick

286
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:27,393
and see what happen to you.

287
00:16:33,637 --> 00:16:35,450
- Trish, why do you do every
time you watch a movie?

288
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,283
- Do what?

289
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,469
- Make threats.

290
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,989
- Because, I'm makin'
sure you know what's up.

291
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:41,988
- Yeah, but I'm not trying
to hear that every time.

292
00:16:42,038 --> 00:16:44,177
Do you wonder why I hate
watching movies with you?

293
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:45,010
Oh, Deante.

294
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,586
Why you don't say stuff
like this to me no more?

295
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:47,419
Or Deante, I'm so happy

296
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:48,796
you're not like this guy in this movie.

297
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:49,875
You treat me so good.

298
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,048
Bro. Chill out.

299
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:54,094
- Deante. Please jump outta
your feelings. Please.

300
00:16:54,144 --> 00:16:55,283
- Yeah. Whatever.

301
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,117
- Whatever to you.

302
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,042
(knocking at the door)

303
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:58,954
Who is that?

304
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:00,578
- I don't know.

305
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:01,492
- Mmhmm.

306
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,375
- Get up.

307
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,328
- What's up bro?

308
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:13,997
- Damn, I can't come in?

309
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:18,986
- What's up Trish.

310
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:19,819
- Oh no.

311
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,335
I know you did not invite Larry over here

312
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:22,814
during our movie time.

313
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,453
- Girl, what are you talking about?

314
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,933
He just randomly stopped by.

315
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:27,432
- Randomly?

316
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:30,182
- Whoa. Look, Trish.

317
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,231
I ain't even gonna be
here that long. I promise.

318
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,321
- Mmhmm.

319
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,153
- [Deante] Trish.

320
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:35,036
- What?

321
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,732
- Can you gimme a minute
so I can holler at him.

322
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:40,991
- Ugh. You so irritating. Make it quick.

323
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,529
- Anyways. What's up bro?

324
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:50,685
- I just came to make sure
we was still good, man.

325
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:55,226
- That's it? Could have
called me for that.

326
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,022
- Nah, I couldn't just call you.

327
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:00,114
I needed to come over and hear you say

328
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,874
that we were still good, bro.

329
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,525
- Look, man, I'm just not
on what you want. You know?

330
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:14,896
- And I'm not asking you
to be Tey, I respect that.

331
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:15,989
I be that guy.

332
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:18,058
But I just need you

333
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,445
to keep being the brains
behind the operation bro.

334
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,156
Look, man. We about to touch
some serious cheese bro.

335
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:25,886
Big money.

336
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,894
But in order for us to
win, I can't have us few.

337
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,170
Look Tey. After my cousin died,

338
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,092
you was the only family I had left.

339
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,181
You my brother, man.

340
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,726
(soft piano music)

341
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,176
I can't do this without you.

342
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:49,799
I need you bro.

343
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,461
My dog, my dog.

344
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,111
Look, I'm about to hit the spot.

345
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,529
Call me if you need anything. I got you.

346
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,378
- Cleveland tonight, right?

347
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,291
- Cleveland tonight. Bet, bet.

348
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,646
And good luck with mad Trish.

349
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:17,515
- Don't even remind me, man.

350
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:18,515
- All right, Trish.

351
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:26,487
- Bro.

352
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:29,651
Da Baby talking that real
money talk, for real.

353
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,688
- So Da little Baby.
So what is you saying?

354
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,780
- Yeah, but not like Da Baby.

355
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,663
Come on now.

356
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,239
- Yeah bro. You trippin'.

357
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:42,531
Sup bro.

358
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:48,745
(hip hop music)

359
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:49,884
- Please tell me y'all not in here

360
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:51,334
getting high off my supply.

361
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,796
- Bro, chill out, man. No man.

362
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,815
(laughs)

363
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:03,357
- Y'all was scared.

364
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,763
- What's the deal?

365
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,262
- [Larry] What we looking like, bro.

366
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:14,310
- Already know. We looking like money.

367
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:19,843
- (indistinct) like money.

368
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:20,810
- For sure.

369
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:26,839
- Hey, my boys, get at me
when you need to re-up.

370
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,471
- [Trey] All right.

371
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,032
- And Da Baby and Meg the Stallion?

372
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,085
- Just because they do a song together

373
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,088
don't mean they together.

374
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,240
- Yeah that's what you think.

375
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:47,292
- [Tiffany] Daddy?

376
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:48,495
- [Steven] Here, Tweetie.

377
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:49,377
- [Tiffany] Hey.

378
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,110
Oh no way. (laughs)

379
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,915
You're sitting here
playing chess by yourself?

380
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:55,748
- What?

381
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,221
- You're doing old people
stuff. You are not that old.

382
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,791
- This is not old people stuff.

383
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,640
- [Tiffany] Oh really?

384
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,350
- This game sharpens up your mind.

385
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,246
- [Tiffany] Right.

386
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,745
- You need to let me
teach you how to play.

387
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,045
- Mm. Mm. Okay.

388
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,074
- [Steven] What you get to eat?

389
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,197
- Veggie fried rice and sesame chicken.

390
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:13,256
- Perfect.

391
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,490
All right. So this is the knight.

392
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,562
- Mhm.

393
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:18,112
- You can call him the horsey.

394
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,213
He's the only piece that
can jump over other pieces.

395
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:23,096
- Okay.

396
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:27,854
What.

397
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,386
- I used to try to teach your
mom how to play all the time.

398
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:33,219
- Really?

399
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,652
- And like you look just like her.

400
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:39,041
Sometimes when I looking at you, I just.

401
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:45,605
- It's okay, Dad.

402
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,254
- Tweetie, I'm sorry.

403
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:49,837
- Really. It's okay.

404
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:50,720
Okay?

405
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:53,306
I mean, I have forgiven you.

406
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:57,964
I promise I have, and
God has forgiven you.

407
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,333
When are you gonna forgive yourself?

408
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,340
(soft piano music)

409
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:10,690
- I don't know if I ever will.

410
00:22:19,654 --> 00:22:20,487
- Okay.

411
00:22:21,553 --> 00:22:24,255
Well, can you do something for me then?

412
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,941
- Yeah. Sure. Anything.

413
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,953
- Can you listen to my
speech after we eat?

414
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,369
- Speech?

415
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,448
- Yeah.

416
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:35,349
- What speech?

417
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,645
- Well, this Sunday is
women's dedication day

418
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:40,057
and the pastor just wants
me to say some, you know,

419
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,856
motivational encouraging words
to the ladies of the church.

420
00:22:42,906 --> 00:22:44,612
- Oh, you gonna be preaching at church.

421
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:45,494
- Oh my...

422
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,411
- Look at God. No, I'm just joking.

423
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:52,653
I will definitely listen to it

424
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:56,025
and I am so proud of you, Tweetie.

425
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,906
- Thanks dad. Thank you. Thank you.

426
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:04,354
Dad?

427
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:05,187
- Hmm?

428
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,928
- Can you do one more thing for me?

429
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:08,198
- Anything.

430
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:10,707
- Stop playing chess by
yourself. Oh my goodness.

431
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:12,856
It is so grandma knit-ish.

432
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,622
- Grandma knit-ish? It's
not grandma knit-ish.

433
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,544
- No I'm telling you, it's
like that in the land.

434
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:20,426
- Oh yeah?

435
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:22,473
I’m a have to believe you.

436
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:25,879
But when I think about vacation, relaxing,

437
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,780
Ohio kind of not the first
place I think about G,

438
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,060
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,509
- You ain't the only person to say that,

440
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,378
but I tell you what, give me one weekend,

441
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:39,597
come down and I guarantee you,

442
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:41,406
you'll change your perspective.

443
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,966
- You know what?

444
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,365
I'm gonna have to hold you for today.

445
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,894
- My man. (laughs) Hey, uh

446
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,264
I don't mind all the small talk and all,

447
00:23:49,314 --> 00:23:51,726
but where your man's at?

448
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,381
- Uh just give him a minute.
He'll be here in a minute.

449
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
- All right.

450
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:25,352
- My bad I'm late.

451
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,411
- The apology would be a little better

452
00:24:27,461 --> 00:24:29,467
if you got that 10 pounds I'm here for.

453
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:37,055
All the strains here?

454
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,797
- Gelatos, gushers, cookies, blue runts.

455
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:39,760
It's all there.

456
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:43,978
- Woo.

457
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:48,097
- Okay, all right. My man.

458
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:51,469
- I'm gonna count this.

459
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,768
- [G] For sure.

460
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:58,550
- Don't worry about it. He count fast.

461
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,180
- Oh, that's cool.

462
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,254
'Cause if this hitting
like your man said it is,

463
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:04,531
I'll be back for more.

464
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,337
- Well, in that case, G from Cleveland.

465
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,170
I see you next time.

466
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,254
- For sure.

467
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:11,386
(laughs)

468
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,482
- We good.

469
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,541
- All right, fellas.

470
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,373
- All right.

471
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,256
- I'll be in touch.

472
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,453
- (laughs) Good?

473
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:41,266
- Yeah, we looking good, man.

474
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:43,025
- 25 G's.

475
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,575
- All day in (indistinct) too.

476
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:47,274
Let's go spend this money.

477
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:48,723
- [Tiffany] Because God made no mistake

478
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:52,489
in making every single last
one of you sitting here today.

479
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:53,375
- Yes.

480
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:56,531
- So on this day

481
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:58,830
I ask you to tell your husband

482
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,736
to tend to the kids so you
can watch your favorite shows

483
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:02,612
(cheering)

484
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,168
and tell the kids to
go bother their father

485
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:05,610
and leave you alone.

486
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,860
(cheering)

487
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,757
Right? Okay? Y'all need a break.

488
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:09,639
- Amen.

489
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:14,365
God bless every single last one of you.

490
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:16,004
I love you all.

491
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:21,053
And may he bless you today,
forever, and always. Thank you.

492
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:24,934
- [Church Member] We love you, Tiffany.

493
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,269
(laughing)

494
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,568
(applause)

495
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:36,472
- That was wonderful.

496
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:37,305
- Thank you.

497
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:39,931
- Great job. No, no. Thank you.

498
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:40,764
- Oh okay.

499
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:43,458
- Oh listen. Your words
gave me life today.

500
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:45,204
- Really? Oh that's-(laughs)

501
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:47,864
- Got to every word in that you said too.

502
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:48,696
- Thank you.

503
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,926
And make sure you treat yourself
to something special today.

504
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,344
- Oh you don't have to tell me twice.

505
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:54,226
- Okay.

506
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:56,594
- I'll see you later.

507
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:57,426
- See you.

508
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,259
- Bye bye.

509
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,092
- Bye.

510
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:00,459
- Well, look at my Tweetie.

511
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:01,599
- Hey dad.

512
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:02,649
- Being a superstar.

513
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:04,882
- Goodness.

514
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:06,129
- That was so good.

515
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,356
I am so proud of you Tweetie.

516
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:10,189
- Thanks dad.

517
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:12,145
- I really am. You are amazing.

518
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:12,978
- Thank you.

519
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:16,224
- I don't know the part
about the giving the kids to,

520
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,295
for the, to watch TV-

521
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,127
- It's women's day.

522
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:18,961
It's about the women today.

523
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:19,794
- You're right, you're right.

524
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:20,626
- Dang.

525
00:27:20,676 --> 00:27:21,459
- Today.

526
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:22,292
- Can they have a day?

527
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:23,168
- A day, 12 hours.

528
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:25,300
(laughs)

529
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,193
- Hey pastor.

530
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:28,370
- Hey pastor.

531
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,949
- Well, now.

532
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:31,732
When I asked you to speak today,

533
00:27:33,298 --> 00:27:35,977
how'd that mean for you to
try to steal my job as pastor?

534
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:37,397
- No, no, no, no, no.

535
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,506
Thank you. I'm flattered
but no, I could never.

536
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,012
- Thank you too.

537
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:44,384
You did a fabulous job today.

538
00:27:44,434 --> 00:27:46,217
God is smiling down on you.

539
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:48,673
- Thank you pastor.

540
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:51,132
And thank you for allowing

541
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:52,275
- [Pastor] Absolutely.

542
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,003
And Steven, we're still on
for later tonight, correct?

543
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:00,952
- I'll be there.

544
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:03,971
- All right.

545
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,390
And I've been keeping my eyes on you.

546
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,762
- What was that about?

547
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:13,894
- I mean, I don't know,

548
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:17,083
but I guess I'm gonna find out later,

549
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:18,363
but for right now,

550
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,652
I want take my favorite
superstar out for dinner

551
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,431
and know how much you
love Chuck E. Cheese.

552
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:26,380
- See now you always
gotta be so embarrassing.

553
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,270
- [Steven] I got my leftover
tokens and all that.

554
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,228
- [Tiffany] You're really not
funny, dad. You're really not.

555
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,944
(hip hop music)

556
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:42,545
- Believe me when I tell you

557
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,324

558
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,139
- Million?

559
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,436
- A mil (indistinct).

560
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,514
- Yo.

561
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,216
- Hey yo boss.

562
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,256
I'm seeing something right now

563
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,755
I don't think you gonna like.

564
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:12,755
- Oh yeah. What's that?

565
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:18,906
- You want me to handle it?

566
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:22,551
- Nah, I got it. I'll take care of it.

567
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,788
- Where is it though?

568
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,473
- All right.

569
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:31,361
- What's up?

570
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,414
- We just gotta make a
lil pit stop real quick.

571
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:37,963
- All right, cool.

572
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:44,960
(radio playing music)

573
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:51,541
(dramatic music)

574
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:55,050
Yo. Slow down, you gonna run him over.

575
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,200
- Well, I guess he better run faster then.

576
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,633
- Peewee, what I tell you about
selling on our corner huh?

577
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:26,863
(grunting)

578
00:30:31,693 --> 00:30:32,519
- Get off him. Stop.

579
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,401
Stop.

580
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:40,415
- Stop thinking you always
gotta be the hero, Tey.

581
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:43,407
- It's broad daylight.
(indistinct) in the street.

582
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:45,106
Think man.

583
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:53,521
(screams)

584
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:57,612
Hey Peewee.

585
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,509
Don't ever let us catch
you over here again.

586
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,711
- All right man. I promise.

587
00:31:12,598 --> 00:31:15,680
- What you still doing over here? Go.

588
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,378
- So they squeeze.

589
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:41,544
- This fool walking around with his girl

590
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:43,294
like it's his in real life, right?

591
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,113
Man, she was walking
around mad comfortable yo.

592
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,662
Like dee dee dee, dee dee dee.

593
00:31:49,127 --> 00:31:51,411
(laughs) Yo.

594
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:54,090
- Man you the fool, man.

595
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,780
Man. You a fool.

596
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,612
- [Peewee] You already know.

597
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:58,719
- She was just mad scared bro.

598
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:01,368
- [Peewee] So hopefully we
can get these guys there.

599
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:04,448
- Man. Every time I'm about to roll up,

600
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:05,695
here come the pastor.

601
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:07,399
- It's a wonderful fish fry. Come on.

602
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:11,594
Hey now, don't stop
getting high on my account.

603
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:13,014
- Nah, it ain't nothing like that, pastor.

604
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,003
- [Pastor] Yeah. What
I tell you, brothers?

605
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:17,632
Don't ever want you to
start acting differently

606
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:18,632
when I come around.

607
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,600
So what up though?

608
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,049
Y'all staying outta trouble?

609
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:27,862
- Always bro.

610
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,698
- Bro. Don't call him bro.

611
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,648
- [Pastor] He's perfectly fine.

612
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:32,547
- My bad pastor.

613
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:35,273
- It's all good. No problem at all.

614
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,038
So Tutu.

615
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:42,707
It's my understanding that
you just got outta jail.

616
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,923
So you can't say always.

617
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:46,805
Can you bro?

618
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:52,201
- See man. That wasn't
even though me though.

619
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,440
For real, for real.

620
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,370
- [Pastor] Hey now told
you I'm not here to judge.

621
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,519
I'm only here to help.

622
00:32:57,429 --> 00:32:58,212
Speaking of which,

623
00:32:58,262 --> 00:33:00,828
I wanna introduce you brothers to someone.

624
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:01,760
This is Steven.

625
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:05,516
He used to run these streets around here,

626
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,099
much like you boys do now.

627
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:09,768
Worse in fact.

628
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:13,533
Now I figured you guys
are tired of hearing

629
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,183
from a goodie, two shoes like myself

630
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,062
and maybe you would
receive it a lot better

631
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,262
from someone cut from
the same cloth as you

632
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:23,870
and just maybe he'd be a
little bit more instrumental

633
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,819
in helping you get your lives
together than I can as well.

634
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:29,868
- No offense Pastor,

635
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,867
but a homeboy here don't look
like he from nobody's street.

636
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:37,033
- Call me homeboy one more time

637
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:40,384
and you just gonna see
how street I really was.

638
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:41,651
- Yeah all right.

639
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,392
- Don't laugh. It ain't
funny. I'm talking to you too.

640
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,661
It's Mr. Simmons. Not homeboy.

641
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,260
You got it?

642
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,800
- Yeah.

643
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:59,568
- [Pastor] Hmm. Well.

644
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:02,440
Looks like you, gentlemen are
gonna get along just fine.

645
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:06,179
Steven, they're in your hands.

646
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:40,627
- Where you going?

647
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:44,866
- To help my grandmother.

648
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:49,191
- This early? You must think I'm stupid.

649
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:50,264
Who is she, Deante?

650
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,710
- What? Who is who?

651
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,799
- Whatever chick you about to go see.

652
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:57,631
- That chick is my grandmother.
Did you not just hear me?

653
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:01,287
- So at seven in the morning

654
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:03,286
you about to go help your grandmother?

655
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:04,456
- No.

656
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:06,146
First I gotta go check on the plants.

657
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:08,755
Then I'm gonna head her way.

658
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:12,004
Wait, why do I explain
myself to you anyways?

659
00:35:12,054 --> 00:35:12,943
Look, I gotta get dressed.

660
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:14,253
You gotta go. You gotta get ready to go.

661
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:15,343
- Okay. Wait, wait baby.

662
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:16,475
Look. I'm sorry.

663
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,064
Come on baby. Don't do that.

664
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,209
You know I was crazy
when you first met me.

665
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:34,179
Look, I just don't want
nobody stealing my man.

666
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:38,478
So how about you let me make it up to you?

667
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:48,161
- No, I'm straight.

668
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:49,044
- You straight?

669
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:51,770
So let me get this right.

670
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,860
Last night, I put on my
favorite Victoria Secrets

671
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,129
for you to tell me that you was tired?

672
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:58,128
And now on top of that, here
we are top of the morning,

673
00:35:58,178 --> 00:35:59,628
you not trying to gimme none?

674
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,110
- I told you, I gotta go.

675
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,526
- All right, Deante.

676
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,359
Don't say nothing,

677
00:36:05,409 --> 00:36:07,815
when I find a real man to satisfy me then.

678
00:36:18,281 --> 00:36:21,363
- When I get out that
shower, you better be gone.

679
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:24,006
- Hey Deante,

680
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:28,081
Deante, I was just playing, dang.

681
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,949
I mean, you ain't have to slam
the door like that though.

682
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:39,746
- [Grandma Tee] He be a
six foot. You feelin' me?

683
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:41,462
So wonderful though.

684
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,203
You know what?

685
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:44,120
- [Tiffany] Thank you.

686
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,619
- I been meaning to ask you a question.

687
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:46,619
- Yeah.

688
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:47,451
- Yeah?

689
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:48,918
- Yes, of course.

690
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:52,473
- [Grandma Tee] Yeah you right about it.

691
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:53,982
- Hey yo, Grandma Tee.

692
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:59,837
- Uh and uh speaking of God-

693
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,296
- Come on, grandma. I
told you I'd be here.

694
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:05,968
- Boy listen, you tell me
you gonna do a lot of things,

695
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,164
but you only do about half of them.

696
00:37:10,214 --> 00:37:12,593
Maybe. Strong maybe.

697
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,400
- Come on, grandma. Come on.

698
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,233
I'm here.

699
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,442
- Okay. All right. Well, okay.

700
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,940
I'm down with it.

701
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm down with it.

702
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,849
Uh Deante. This is Tiffany.

703
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:26,558
A real woman.

704
00:37:26,608 --> 00:37:29,347
Tiffany. This is my grandson Deante.

705
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:31,966
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

706
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,356
- Now he don't have a job right now,

707
00:37:34,406 --> 00:37:36,475
but just work with it. Okay?

708
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:37,624
Yeah. Work with it, work with it.

709
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:38,854
- Okay.

710
00:37:38,904 --> 00:37:40,354
- Why don't you show
him where everything is

711
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:42,473
so he can get himself situated

712
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:46,432
and make himself useful
around here today. Okay?

713
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,264
- Mhm.

714
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:49,211
- [Grandma Tee] And I'm gonna
be over there if you need me,

715
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,660
I'll be around. Okay?

716
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,493
- Okay.

717
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,499
- I'll see you later.

718
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,887
- They're runnin' an old person home man.

719
00:37:56,937 --> 00:38:00,157
- (laughs) Um shall we?

720
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:01,040
- Yes.

721
00:38:11,093 --> 00:38:12,943
Anyways. I'm so sorry about that.

722
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:14,462
- Oh no. It's okay.

723
00:38:14,512 --> 00:38:16,861
Trust me. If my dad was
here, we would be even.

724
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:18,794
Like, for real.

725
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:19,626
- Yeah? I doubt that.

726
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,890
- No, I'm serious.

727
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,548
I might even be up on
like, he is embarrassing,

728
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,231
like so embarrassing.

729
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,387
- And you know what? For the record,

730
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:32,546
I don't got a job right now, but I mean,

731
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:34,095
it's not like I can't get one.

732
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:35,915
I can find a job,

733
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,954
but I'm just trying my
entrepreneur thing right now.

734
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,294
You know? You get that?

735
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:43,602
- Yeah, no look, I'm not judging
you and um congratulations.

736
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,302
- Congratulations?

737
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:46,301
- To your business.

738
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:49,473
- Oh yeah. Thanks.

739
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,719
- So you gonna tell me what it is?

740
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:55,575
- Oh, um it's uh.

741
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,156
- Oh, I'm sorry. It's not like,

742
00:38:57,206 --> 00:38:58,992
I'm not trying to get
all up in your business.

743
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,641
- No, no, no, no. It's not that.

744
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:06,075
All right. So I'm like one of those people

745
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,974
that are like very superstitious.

746
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:08,807
- Yeah.

747
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:10,853
- So being the fact that I'm
just getting it up and running,

748
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,610
I don't like talking
about it much, you know?

749
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,092
- Oh, is that really what it is?

750
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:17,264
Or are you just not operating in faith?

751
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,769
- Oh wait, don't tell me you one of those.

752
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:22,799
- One of those?

753
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,288
- Yeah. You know, one of those,

754
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:26,298
everything you say is always scriptures

755
00:39:26,348 --> 00:39:28,184
and nothing is ever wrong with you

756
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:30,017
and you're always blessing the holy favor.

757
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,066
- Or one of those.

758
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:32,899
- Yeah. One of those.

759
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:35,394
- Yeah. No, I'm not, not at all.

760
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:39,024
But all I'm saying is if
you're gonna have a business,

761
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,523
you gotta be confident in it.

762
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:45,691
Because if you're not confident,

763
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:47,191
why should your consumers be?

764
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,221
- I feel that.

765
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:54,120
- [Tiffany] Yeah.

766
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:56,613
- But um. Hey, you hungry?

767
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:58,994
- Yeah. Actually.

768
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:03,927
You wanna um, put this stuff back?

769
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:06,059
- [Deante] Nah it's good.

770
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:10,443
- (laughs) I mean,

771
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,972
I thought it was weird when you walked up,

772
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:14,262
you called her Grandma Tee.
But at least at that point,

773
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,011
I thought it was because her
name is Teresa, you know?

774
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,019
- Yeah. Everybody think that, but um nah,

775
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:24,038
we call her Grandma Tee because
whenever we would act up

776
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,837
she would tee off on our behind.

777
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:26,669
- What?

778
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,287
- And then gotta let the
whole world know too.

779
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,516
Just bust through this though.

780
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:31,336
All right now, I'm about
to tee off on that ass

781
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:32,834
if you don't sit down.

782
00:40:32,884 --> 00:40:33,667
- [Tiffany] Uh uh.

783
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:35,634
- Yes. Trust me. She crazy.

784
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,663
- I just, I, I can't imagine
Miss Teresa swearing.

785
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:40,133
Like she is so sweet.

786
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:43,962
- Yeah. Okay. Trust me, my
whole neighborhood know her

787
00:40:44,012 --> 00:40:45,221
as Grandma Tee.

788
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:47,180
That's 'cause nobody on my
block was safe for real.

789
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,323
- Are you serious?

790
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,418
Okay. So don't mess with
Grandma Tee. Duly noted.

791
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,828
- Yeah. That's definitely not
the one you wanna mess with.

792
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:56,710
- Wow.

793
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:01,663
- But um enough about me. What about you?

794
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:05,844
- Um well, my dad was involved heavily

795
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,114
in the street life at one point

796
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,796
and my mom died because of it.

797
00:41:14,671 --> 00:41:15,591
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,010
I, I should have definitely
eased you into that.

799
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,110
I just kinda.

800
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,188
- Nah, that's I-I'm sorry.

801
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:22,400
I didn't know, I wouldn't have asked.

802
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,849
- No it's it's okay. I
mean it's not your fault.

803
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,356
- So what happened?

804
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,189
Wait, wait, wait.

805
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,355
That's stupid. You shouldn't even.

806
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:34,837
- It is okay, really um.

807
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:37,913
Long story short. My
dad told the wrong man

808
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,083
he wasn't gonna pay him
back the money he owed him.

809
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:43,931
So one day, this man kicks the door in

810
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:46,051
and shoots my dad three times.

811
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,510
And my mom like any loving wife, you know,

812
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,839
she tried to protect him by
jumping in front of the bullets.

813
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:55,078
It was like, literally
something you see in movies.

814
00:41:55,128 --> 00:42:00,126
So um bad news is my
mom died, but good news,

815
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:02,015
my dad got off the streets

816
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:03,865
and has turned his life over to God.

817
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:10,149
So, well we-we're still
working on that part, but yeah.

818
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,564
You know. Good things.

819
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:21,742
What?

820
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:24,395
- I mean, I basically just sat here

821
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:26,727
and told you that my Grandma Tee raised me

822
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,446
because both of my
parents were drug addicts

823
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:32,985
and I still got salt in my
heart about that, you know?

824
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:33,924
- Yeah.

825
00:42:33,974 --> 00:42:36,913
- But you just sat here
and told me your story,

826
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:39,815
calmly and with the
ability to laugh at it.

827
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:43,294
- I wasn't always like this. Okay?

828
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:47,840
It's just, I can't keep
carrying my past with me.

829
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,369
You know, everything happens for a reason

830
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:52,888
and I'd rather focus on
what's in front of me

831
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:54,458
than what's behind me.

832
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:56,607
I still have my dad heavily in my life.

833
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,436
So I just focus on that.

834
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:02,365
- I feel that.

835
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:03,198
(phone vibrating)

836
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,080
- Yeah.

837
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,113
- Um I'm sorry. I gotta take this.

838
00:43:09,163 --> 00:43:09,995
- No it's cool.

839
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:20,869
- Yo, kind of busy right now.

840
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:24,377
- Yo Tey. Hey, I need
you to do me a favor bro.

841
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:26,527
Trey and Lil Magnum, they trying to re-up,

842
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:29,266
but I need you to get that to 'em ASAP.

843
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:32,095
- You go get it to 'em. I
just told you I was busy.

844
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:34,004
- Don't you think if I could, I would?

845
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:35,224
I gotta go see my PO man,

846
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:39,645
just go get up off of Trish
and go handle that, ASAP.

847
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:53,468
- Tiffany? I'm so sorry. I
gotta go handle a situation.

848
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:56,517
- Is situation another
word for girlfriend?

849
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,399
- What? No.

850
00:43:59,357 --> 00:44:01,475
- I'm sorry, Deante.

851
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,397
I'm just messing with you. You
can go handle your business.

852
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:08,330
- But um finish (indistinct).

853
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:11,399
- I mean, you have my number. So.

854
00:44:30,665 --> 00:44:33,024
- Bro, first off Brian can play

855
00:44:33,074 --> 00:44:35,464
all five positions on the floor.

856
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:36,590
Jordan couldn't even do that.

857
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,883
- Man what?

858
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,792
Jordan won defensive player of the year.

859
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,692
How couldn't he do that?

860
00:44:41,742 --> 00:44:43,391
- Brian could have won
like two or three of those.

861
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,640
So what are you saying?

862
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,063
- Key word could have, but didn't.

863
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,945
- What up though?

864
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:54,250
I can't call it. Lemme get a zip.

865
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:04,857
- Hey, your sister still with her boy?

866
00:45:06,113 --> 00:45:08,123
- Man. I don't pay
attention to what she do.

867
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,652
- Look. I'm gonna need you
to start paying attention.

868
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:12,001
I'm trying to get on that.

869
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,299
- You do know you talking
about my sister, right?

870
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,182
- I know.

871
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:26,879
- Y'all be cool.

872
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,189
- For sure. For sure.

873
00:45:39,014 --> 00:45:43,290
- What up though? Merry
Christmas. I'm back.

874
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,172
- Oh yeah.

875
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:49,838
Hey yo old boy. He's just
tryin' this out, literally.

876
00:45:49,888 --> 00:45:50,750
- Oh yeah?

877
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,583
- Yeah.

878
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:52,416
- See y'all boys out here working.

879
00:45:52,466 --> 00:45:54,497
- [Trey and Lil Mag] Yes, sir.

880
00:45:54,547 --> 00:45:55,656
- [Larry] This a deal, y'all boys.

881
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:58,042
- What's up Larry? What's the deal?

882
00:45:58,092 --> 00:45:58,874
What's the deal on baby?

883
00:45:58,924 --> 00:45:59,707
- [Larry] I take it y'all together?

884
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:00,928
- Yeah. We good bro.

885
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:05,088
- Lemme show you the crib real quick.

886
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:14,458
Man. Look, I just got
a call from G earlier,

887
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,599
said he trying to meet in a week.

888
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,709
- For real?

889
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:19,591
- Yes.

890
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:22,135
Deante.

891
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:25,017
Can you please be on time this time bro?

892
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:28,145
- Dog, we still reliving that, man?

893
00:46:28,195 --> 00:46:31,164
- Nah, man, I just gotta
keep you focused man.

894
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:36,213
But um side note, what
you so busy doing earlier?

895
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:41,164
- I mean, you know,
just helping my grandma.

896
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,110
- Yeah. I figured.

897
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,209
All right, well let's get this money man.

898
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:53,050
But uh man, just get on
me later, man. I'm on you.

899
00:46:54,107 --> 00:46:54,889
Trey and Lil Mag.

900
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,814
- [Trey And Lil Mag] Yeah.

901
00:46:56,864 --> 00:46:57,726
- Man y'all better get
here and clean this up.

902
00:46:57,775 --> 00:47:00,353
What y'all think? Y'all mama live here?

903
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:01,357
You ain't got no nanny.

904
00:47:01,407 --> 00:47:03,437
- Man. I'm a drug dealer, man.

905
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,289
- Hey dad.

906
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:17,362
- [Steven] Hey Tweetie.

907
00:47:20,168 --> 00:47:22,110
- So how's it going?

908
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:26,256
- No, it's um it's funny you ask that

909
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:29,168
'cause I really do think
I found my calling.

910
00:47:30,175 --> 00:47:32,574
When I'm out there with them boys.

911
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:34,110
I'm telling 'em about
all the stuff that I did.

912
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,143
Like I really do think they listen

913
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:38,007
and I just don't want 'em

914
00:47:38,057 --> 00:47:39,644
to have to go through like the same-

915
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,732
Tweetie.

916
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:48,796
Tweetie.

917
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:50,318
- Huh?

918
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,541
- Am I boring you or something?

919
00:47:51,591 --> 00:47:54,036
- No, no. No, dad.

920
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,486
That was, that was rude. I'm sorry.

921
00:47:56,536 --> 00:48:00,137
I'm listening. So you said
you, you found your calling?

922
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:11,253
(synth music)

923
00:48:23,696 --> 00:48:26,436
- So lemme guess, that ain't no chick

924
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,468
that you texting back and
forth with either, huh?

925
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:30,377
- What?

926
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:34,386
- I said, who is you texting, Deante?

927
00:48:40,981 --> 00:48:41,813
- Trish.

928
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:45,282
You really need to remember
who you talking to, sometimes.

929
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,857
You know, I used to think your
jealousy was kind of cute,

930
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:52,427
but now it's annoying as hell.

931
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:56,106
And I think we both know when I'm annoyed,

932
00:48:56,156 --> 00:48:57,505
that ain't good for nobody.

933
00:48:58,572 --> 00:48:59,941
- So you said all that to say what?

934
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:02,596
Because I know you not
trying to break up with me.

935
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:09,734
Um hello? I know you
hear me talking to you.

936
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,507
- Yeah. I heard you.

937
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:21,404
- Oh no he didn't.

938
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:30,504
- [Tiffany] So you really have
never gone bowling before,

939
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:33,193
like not ever, not even as a kid.

940
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:35,012
- Nope. Not even as a kid.

941
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,119
- Are you serious? Oh my goodness.

942
00:49:37,169 --> 00:49:41,000
I feel so bad. Like when you
said I could pick the place,

943
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,030
I just assumed.

944
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:46,382
- Tiff, it's cool. I
like trying new things.

945
00:49:46,432 --> 00:49:47,545
- Oh really?

946
00:49:47,595 --> 00:49:48,678
Well, me too.

947
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,106
So um out of curiosity,

948
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:56,655
what else have you never done?

949
00:49:59,384 --> 00:50:00,934
- Honestly, you'd be surprised.

950
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,926
- Okay. And I thought I was lame

951
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,663
- Chill out. (laughs)

952
00:50:10,713 --> 00:50:11,720
- I mean I'm serious,

953
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:15,079
it's like usually home and church for me.

954
00:50:15,129 --> 00:50:16,578
This is way outta my element.

955
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:22,010
- Well good thing you like
trying to do things, right?

956
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,674
- So just grab a ball

957
00:50:30,724 --> 00:50:33,096
and try to knock as many down as possible.

958
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,619
- But at the end of the day,

959
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:49,188
like nobody forcing y'all to sell drugs.

960
00:50:49,238 --> 00:50:51,827
- Nobody forcing us? Man,
the system forcing me.

961
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:53,793
Nobody handing no high
school drop-out no job.

962
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,985
And on top of that, I'm black. Come on.

963
00:50:57,035 --> 00:51:01,213
- Man talk to him. I'm
saying if I don't hustle,

964
00:51:01,263 --> 00:51:02,243
I don't eat.

965
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:04,342
- Yeah Mr. Simmons, I gotta eat too.

966
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,141
- So why don't y'all
go back to school, man.

967
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:12,940
Get a GED, a, a, a trade, something.

968
00:51:14,398 --> 00:51:15,648
- [Peewee] GDE?

969
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,404
(laughs)

970
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:22,496
- Well, I, I didn't, I
didn't say nothing funny.

971
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,965
- Mr. Simmons's no disrespect, man,

972
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,815
but it's over for that school stuff.

973
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:30,419
- You feel me? Come on,
gimme something on that, bro.

974
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,032
- Mr. Simmons, man. What you doing?

975
00:51:34,082 --> 00:51:37,584
- It ain't what I'm
doing. It's what I did.

976
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,970
I done talk that same talk
and walk that same walk

977
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,629
as y'all walk.

978
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:45,079
And you know what it got me?

979
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:53,846
I got three bullets, a
$10,000 medical bill,

980
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:56,578
and a dead wife.

981
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:01,573
And y'all running around here like this,

982
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:05,126
like this hood stuff is
so, is so happy go lucky.

983
00:52:05,176 --> 00:52:08,508
But what happens when they come for you?

984
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:15,928
Tutu, what happens when
you serve in the thing?

985
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:17,331
But that thing ain't there for that,

986
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:19,080
that thing that'll rob you.

987
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,426
But you ain't no punks,
so you pull your pistol,

988
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:24,148
but he's already pulled, then bang.

989
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,574
These two fools at your funeral,
fumbling over the obituary.

990
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:35,991
Hey, you said when you rob people,

991
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,191
you take your pistol
just so you can scare.

992
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,412
But what happens when you rob
somebody that ain't scared?

993
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:46,968
'Cause if you would've
ran up on me about like

994
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:49,950
about a year ago?

995
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:54,345
It wouldn't come out how
you thought it would.

996
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:56,974
But who am I though, right?

997
00:52:58,154 --> 00:52:59,557
I'm just the OG. Cut.

998
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:08,154
- Word.

999
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,369
- Well, that was fun.

1000
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:13,249
- Oh yeah?

1001
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:15,298
Watching me throw the world
record for gutter balls is fun?

1002
00:53:15,348 --> 00:53:17,081
- Oh yes, absolutely.

1003
00:53:19,316 --> 00:53:21,415
But no, really, I had a good time tonight.

1004
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:25,264
- Good enough that you might
wanna do it again sometime?

1005
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:26,472
- Depends.

1006
00:53:26,522 --> 00:53:27,564
- On what?

1007
00:53:27,614 --> 00:53:30,011
- If you let me pick the place again.

1008
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:30,844
- You know I would,

1009
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:32,652
but that didn't work out
too well for me last time.

1010
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:37,071
- Yeah, I know. I know. But
um this would be good for you.

1011
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:39,250
- Yeah. Okay. When and where?

1012
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,422
- This Sunday, come to church with me.

1013
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:44,298
- Church?

1014
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:46,348
- Yeah, church.

1015
00:53:46,398 --> 00:53:48,497
Oh, oh what? You're too cool for church?

1016
00:53:48,547 --> 00:53:50,276
- No, it's not that.

1017
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:51,159
- Then what?

1018
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:59,813
- Nothing. Sunday. Church, I'll be there.

1019
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:03,255
- Great. Okay. Well then
I'll see you Sunday.

1020
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:07,542
- Lemme get that door for you.

1021
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:09,924
(R&B music)

1022
00:54:23,755 --> 00:54:24,698
- Thanks.

1023
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:25,580
- Yeah.

1024
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:43,905
- [Grandma Tee] There ya go.

1025
00:54:43,955 --> 00:54:44,738
- Thanks.

1026
00:54:44,788 --> 00:54:46,028
- [Grandma Tee] You're welcome.

1027
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:50,229
- So um I be coming to church Sunday.

1028
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:55,797
- Ooh. This must be the day
Jesus is coming back. Yeah.

1029
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:01,482
- Hmm. Grandma. It's not
that deep, all right?

1030
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,885
- Oh yes it is.

1031
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,010
I've been trying to get you
to go to church for years.

1032
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,280
And now you gonna pop up out the blue,

1033
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,202
talking about you going to church?

1034
00:55:12,169 --> 00:55:14,978
- I guess. But I mean, Tiffany invited me.

1035
00:55:15,028 --> 00:55:16,137
So I told her I come.

1036
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,397
- Hoo. Praise the Lord.

1037
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:19,736
You done got rid of that thing

1038
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:21,659
and got yourself a real woman.

1039
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:25,944
- Grandma. It's not like that, all right?

1040
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:27,936
Me and Tiff, we just cool.

1041
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:34,151
- Listen, if that girl can
get you to go to church,

1042
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,933
you need to let the
cool go and heat it up.

1043
00:55:38,178 --> 00:55:40,212
Mhm. She's the real package.

1044
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:43,818
Talking 'bout y'all just cool.

1045
00:55:43,868 --> 00:55:46,140
Boy, you better shoot your shot.

1046
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:52,789
- Shoot my shot?

1047
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:54,165
- [Grandma Tee] Mhm.

1048
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,394
- Where you even learn that from?

1049
00:55:56,444 --> 00:55:57,277
- Tinder.

1050
00:55:58,993 --> 00:55:59,826
- Grandma.

1051
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:05,741
- I told you don't put
them hands on Floyd.

1052
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,780
- Man, what fight was you watching?

1053
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,662
- The fight where he put them
hands on him. What you mean?

1054
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:11,579
- Man, he barely touched Floyd bro.

1055
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:13,398
- Man, Floyd. Oh, he can't
handle that young boy?

1056
00:56:13,448 --> 00:56:16,177
- Man, Floyd knocked him outta
hell, so he went forward.

1057
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:17,077
- What up though.

1058
00:56:19,736 --> 00:56:20,586
Lemme grab a zip.

1059
00:56:26,327 --> 00:56:27,859
- Man what's up with your mask, man?

1060
00:56:27,909 --> 00:56:29,659
- You know how it go.

1061
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:33,391
- You know what this is.

1062
00:56:33,441 --> 00:56:34,508
Take that ice off.

1063
00:56:38,368 --> 00:56:39,659
Take off that watch man.

1064
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:41,512
- It's yours. You got it.

1065
00:56:45,657 --> 00:56:46,947
- Oh hell no. I know you wanna-

1066
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:49,459
- Shut up. Or die. Your choice.

1067
00:56:50,296 --> 00:56:51,545
- Now where the money at?

1068
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:54,936
- He said where the money at, man.

1069
00:56:56,364 --> 00:56:59,316
- I'm not gonna to ask you again.

1070
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,685
It's in the back. Under the fence.

1071
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:09,729
You lucky you got that gun.

1072
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:11,655
- Hey bro. We good?

1073
00:57:12,938 --> 00:57:13,771
- Jack pot.

1074
00:57:15,737 --> 00:57:17,267
- Guess you don't die.

1075
00:57:25,226 --> 00:57:26,059
- Damn.

1076
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:30,589
Man. I told you that's
the boy I ain't like.

1077
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:32,358
Ain't even see it coming.

1078
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:00,372
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1079
00:58:00,422 --> 00:58:02,081
But I think one of y'all
need to start talking

1080
00:58:02,131 --> 00:58:03,974
and tell me what the hell happened.

1081
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:07,350
- They put guns on us L.

1082
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,612
- Trey. Don't say nothing
about no damn guns.

1083
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:13,041
Like I ain't give y'all none.

1084
00:58:15,177 --> 00:58:16,597
You better off saying y'all scared 'cause

1085
00:58:16,647 --> 00:58:19,096
I hate to think one of y'all set me up.

1086
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:21,775
You still got your watch on, your chain.

1087
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:24,024
- No, it ain't like that.

1088
00:58:24,074 --> 00:58:25,926
- [Larry] So what is
it like then, Lil Mag?

1089
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:29,562
Since Trey here seemed to be
a little limited in his words,

1090
00:58:29,612 --> 00:58:32,484
tell me what it was like and be specific.

1091
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:37,669
- Look buddy he came up to
the porch, asked for a zip,

1092
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:40,329
Trey got up and went and got it for him.

1093
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:42,628
Next thing I know he
pulled a tool out on me.

1094
00:58:43,866 --> 00:58:46,499
Then two of his homeboys
ran back there on Trey.

1095
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,958
After that, got us for everything.

1096
00:58:51,815 --> 00:58:52,644
- Well man, how the hell did they know

1097
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:54,247
where my money was at?

1098
00:58:57,443 --> 00:59:00,152
- When I went to the back
to get the (indistinct),

1099
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:02,411
they asked me where everything was at.

1100
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:04,210
Man, I ain't say nothing at first,

1101
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,350
but then when he put the gun to my head,

1102
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,149
I told him where everything was at.

1103
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:17,169
- And y'all ain't never seen
these dudes around here before?

1104
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:19,872
Didn't recognize him at all?

1105
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,474
- Matter of fact,

1106
00:59:23,524 --> 00:59:26,123
he just came and bought a
zip from us the other day.

1107
00:59:27,043 --> 00:59:29,002
And when I seen him leaving,

1108
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:31,594
I recognized the car they was
in, I know where they be at.

1109
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,806
- All right.

1110
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:41,508
- Matter of fact, matter of fact, we goin'.

1111
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:44,980
- Nah, we ain't going do nothing.

1112
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,316
I'm going to get back what's mine.

1113
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:51,482
But y'all coming with me though.

1114
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,533
And not only to see what's
about to happen to them,

1115
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,383
but to see what's gonna happen
to y'all the very next time

1116
00:59:57,433 --> 00:59:59,282
y'all let something like this happen.

1117
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:04,550
Go get in the car, man.

1118
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:36,872
- Yo Tey. Call me ASAP
bro. We got a problem.

1119
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,803
(deep bass music)

1120
01:00:54,853 --> 01:00:56,413
- [Trey] Look, I knew I recognize the car.

1121
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:57,662
There it is right there.

1122
01:00:58,982 --> 01:01:00,481
- [Larry] You sure that's the spot?

1123
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,218
- [Trey] Man I'm positive bro.

1124
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,172
That's the car. Spin around.

1125
01:01:20,864 --> 01:01:21,845
- What you doing?

1126
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:24,113
- What you mean? I'm about
to go get what's ours.

1127
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:27,171
- Nah, I'm about to go get what's mine.

1128
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,671
I'm trying to get tough.
Now you had your chance.

1129
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,489
Y'all stay in car. Y'all look out.

1130
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:34,372
- All right man.

1131
01:01:46,512 --> 01:01:48,924
- Y'all was acting all scared
to get this money though.

1132
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:51,206
Man. I told you it would work.

1133
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:54,819
- Man. I wasn't scared. But to
see your mans in here though.

1134
01:01:58,231 --> 01:01:59,134
- Scared. Yeah.

1135
01:02:00,373 --> 01:02:01,703
- Fellas, fellas.

1136
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:03,992
What's the word?

1137
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:07,798
Hope I ain't interrupted nothing.

1138
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:09,497
Somebody left the back door open.

1139
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:11,666
I was hoping

1140
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:14,998
maybe y'all could help me
with something real quick.

1141
01:02:16,415 --> 01:02:18,664
See my guys, they seem to
misplaced a lot of my weed

1142
01:02:18,714 --> 01:02:22,616
and money and I was told maybe
y'all could help me find it.

1143
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:26,794
Matter of fact, this look
like them right there.

1144
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:34,252
Woo. Those definitely mine.

1145
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:38,467
So I tell you what,

1146
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:42,639
I need both of y'all to pick
a number from one to 10.

1147
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:49,047
Pick a number.

1148
01:02:52,575 --> 01:02:53,407
- Three.

1149
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:00,654
- Nine.

1150
01:03:03,402 --> 01:03:04,268
(gun shot)

1151
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:06,977
(screaming)

1152
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,109
(laughs)

1153
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:14,857
- You see he was the closest.

1154
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:17,546
The number was 10.

1155
01:03:22,022 --> 01:03:23,188
- Come on man.

1156
01:03:24,822 --> 01:03:25,655
- Pick a number.

1157
01:03:26,645 --> 01:03:29,176
(gun shot)

1158
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:32,558
(dramatic string music)

1159
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:46,931
- You told me not to be late.

1160
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:57,751
L, what's up?

1161
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,403
- I called you the other day
and told you we had a problem.

1162
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:04,718
- Yeah, well sorry.

1163
01:04:04,768 --> 01:04:06,448
I got the kind of life where
I can't always answer my phone

1164
01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:08,457
when the name Larry pops up.

1165
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:11,216
I was actually in a fight
with Trish when you called,

1166
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,985
but I text you the next day,
ask you what was going on.

1167
01:04:14,035 --> 01:04:15,895
- Yeah, I got your message.

1168
01:04:15,945 --> 01:04:18,594
But by that time I had
already handled the situation.

1169
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:20,803
- Okay. So what's up?

1170
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:25,991
- Somebody ran up in the
spot on Trey and Lil Mag.

1171
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:27,331
- What?

1172
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:31,549
- Yeah. Took everything. But it's cool.

1173
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,762
I found him, I handled it.

1174
01:04:36,621 --> 01:04:38,170
- What you mean you handled it?

1175
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:49,063
- Look alive. There go
G. Yo G from Cleveland.

1176
01:04:49,113 --> 01:04:49,900
- [G] What's up fellas?

1177
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,733
- What's up brother.

1178
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:51,616
- Word.

1179
01:04:56,031 --> 01:04:58,850
- [Pastor] Some of you are
in situations right now

1180
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,772
that you know, you need to get out.

1181
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:08,220
Some of you are at jobs that
you know you need to quit.

1182
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:12,636
But you're too complacent
and you're too scared

1183
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:16,314
to go after that career that
you know you really want.

1184
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:20,696
I'm telling you that God
said you need to get out.

1185
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:27,041
Some of you are in ungodly relationships

1186
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:31,339
that you've been in far, far too long.

1187
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:32,596
- [Church Member] Yes sir.

1188
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:35,842
- [Pastor] But you don't wanna start over.

1189
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:37,300
- [Church Member] Yes
sir, yes sir, yes sir.

1190
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,836
- Well maybe, you feel
like a little too old

1191
01:05:39,886 --> 01:05:41,776
to wait on the right one

1192
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:44,328
and that love that God has for you.

1193
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:49,153
- [Tiffany] Thank you.

1194
01:05:49,203 --> 01:05:50,243
- [Deante] You're welcome.

1195
01:05:52,162 --> 01:05:53,412
- See?

1196
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:54,244
- See what.

1197
01:05:54,294 --> 01:05:55,694
- I told you you'd like it.

1198
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,420
- Who said I liked it, huh?

1199
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:59,980
- Oh, come on. I saw your face in there,

1200
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,792
you definitely liked it.

1201
01:06:02,779 --> 01:06:05,708
- I mean, I would admit
he did give a good speech.

1202
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:07,037
(laughs)

1203
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:07,870
What?

1204
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,676
- Sermon. Not a speech.

1205
01:06:09,726 --> 01:06:10,622
- [Steven] Tweetie.

1206
01:06:10,672 --> 01:06:11,455
- Oh my bad.

1207
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:12,287
- Hey.

1208
01:06:12,337 --> 01:06:13,120
- I gotta get outta here.

1209
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,015
I'm gonna go change and get with the boys.

1210
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:17,444
Um Deante, pleased to meet you young man.

1211
01:06:17,494 --> 01:06:18,433
- Nice to meet you too, sir.

1212
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:19,633
- All right. Uh tonight?

01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:20,882
- Yes. Dinner, seven.

- What time?

- 7:00 PM. Don't be late.

1216
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:24,201
- All right. Love you baby.

1217
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:25,418
See you later.

1218
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,999
- So Tweetie, huh?

1219
01:06:30,049 --> 01:06:32,032
- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1220
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,997
Uh uh, only my dad calls me that.

1221
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:39,072
- Nah, I kind of like it got
little ring to it, you know?

1222
01:06:39,122 --> 01:06:42,645
- No it doesn't because
you will never, ever,

1223
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:44,465
ever call me that. Okay?

1224
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:46,111
- Okay.

1225
01:06:46,161 --> 01:06:47,110
- Okay.

1226
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,242
(laughs)

1227
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:54,031
So um would you like to
come to dinner tonight?

1228
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:55,924
I mean you can invite Miss Teresa.

1229
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,150
- Uh that's a hard pass but um.

1230
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,189
- I mean, okay. You don't have to.

1231
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:02,431
- No no no no I, I want to.

- Okay. Well um it's tonight

1233
01:07:09,656 --> 01:07:10,966
- I won't.

1234
01:07:11,016 --> 01:07:14,394
- Okay. Well I'm gonna go help out. Yeah?

1235
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:15,277
- Okay.

1236
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:20,819
Dinner with Tweetie. Mm.

1237
01:07:33,518 --> 01:07:36,590
- Look at y'all drinking
even on the Lord's day. Huh?

1238
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:42,928
I don't care, man. I'm just-What's up?

1239
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:45,387
Where little Tutu?

1240
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:48,123
- Hopefully having a great conversation

1241
01:07:48,173 --> 01:07:49,423
with your wife right now.

1242
01:07:50,932 --> 01:07:51,882
- Wait, what, what?

1243
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,611
- Yeah. Mr. Simmons.

1244
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:57,773
It's like you saw the future.
He got killed yesterday.

1245
01:08:04,368 --> 01:08:05,827
- What happened, man?

1246
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,778
- You don't know?

1247
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:14,917
Like the streets tell it. He
tried to rob the wrong one.

1248
01:08:15,914 --> 01:08:19,452
- It's cool though. 'Cause
when we find out who did it,

1249
01:08:19,502 --> 01:08:21,842
we gonna handle that. Believe it.

1250
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,391
- [Peewee] Facts.

1251
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:24,621
- And then what?

1252
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:28,784
- Come on OG. Don't act like
you don't know what's up.

1253
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:32,401
- I do know what's up and I
know it's just a revolving door.

1254
01:08:34,227 --> 01:08:36,677
What if you do go get them fools

1255
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:39,196
and end up just like little Tutu.

1256
01:08:39,246 --> 01:08:40,508
God rest this soul.

1257
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:43,994
Well, let's just say if
you do get down on 'em

1258
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:47,073
every night before I go to bed,

1259
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,792
I see the white of every
man's eyes I ever killed.

1260
01:08:50,842 --> 01:08:52,041
You ready for that, huh?

1261
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:54,214
You ready to go to hell?

1262
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,269
'Cause that's where you going
doing stupid stuff like that.

1263
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:03,361
Hey. Hey. Live little brother. Live.

1264
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,778
Gimme that down there.

1265
01:09:18,025 --> 01:09:19,774
To my young dog Tutu.

1266
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:32,436
Damn.

1267
01:09:40,018 --> 01:09:40,851
- Okay.

1268
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:47,891
Okay.

1269
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:53,521
(clears throat)

1270
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:54,353
Hey.

1271
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:55,240
- Hey.

1272
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:56,088
- Come on in.

1273
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:56,971
- Okay.

1274
01:10:06,026 --> 01:10:07,106
I actually brought you something.

1275
01:10:07,156 --> 01:10:11,285
- Oh, thank you. Um you can
follow me back this way.

1276
01:10:11,335 --> 01:10:16,333
- Cool. So um your dad's not here?

1277
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:20,751
- Oh yeah. He called and
said he had to stay behind

1278
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:22,351
and help the kids he mentors.

1279
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,541
- Oh, he mentors?

1280
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:24,530
- Something like that.

1281
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:26,100
He talks to kids on the street

1282
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,669
and tries to get 'em off the street.

1283
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:32,088
So with that being
said, we are here alone.

1284
01:10:32,138 --> 01:10:33,687
- Okay. Okay. That's what's up.

1285
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:37,269
So um this all looks good.

1286
01:10:38,206 --> 01:10:39,114
- Oh, thanks.

1287
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,637
- So I guess you don't just
cook. You throw down, huh?

1288
01:10:41,687 --> 01:10:44,613
- Oh, I mean, I wouldn't
really say all that.

1289
01:10:44,663 --> 01:10:47,073
Um my mom was really
the one to throw down,

1290
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:49,015
but I learned a few things from her.

1291
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,931
Oh. Would you like anything
other than that to drink?

1292
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,160
- Oh no, that looks good.

1293
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:54,993
- Okay.

1294
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:56,069
- Let me get that for you though.

1295
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:56,951
- Thanks.

1296
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:01,650
Thank you.

1297
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,116
- You're welcome.

1298
01:11:13,112 --> 01:11:15,786
- So um would do you like to say grace?

1299
01:11:16,913 --> 01:11:18,695
- Oh, nah, you can do all that.

1300
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:24,333
- Deante, don't tell
me you don't say grace.

1301
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,329
- I mean not really.

1302
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:30,448
- Oh, so you're definitely saying it.

1303
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:31,682
You're saying it.

1304
01:11:31,732 --> 01:11:33,148
Come on, come on.

1305
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:41,104
- God. Thanks for the food.

1306
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:44,113
And hopefully it's good
on the way down. Amen.

1307
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:45,403
- Amen.

1308
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:46,995
Now was that so hard?

1309
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:50,421
Bon appetit.

1310
01:11:57,556 --> 01:12:00,305
(soft R&B music)

1311
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,172
(laughs)

1312
01:12:19,521 --> 01:12:22,510
I can't believe you've
never been swimming before.

1313
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,733
Like, what? Oh my gosh.

1314
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,638
I'm sorry.

1315
01:12:29,688 --> 01:12:30,968
- See, I told you you
was gonna laugh at me.

1316
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:35,666
- Yeah. I'm sorry. I can't,
but it's really cute.

1317
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:38,938
- Yeah. Okay.

1318
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:45,070
But anyways, your turn, what's
your favorite thing to do?

1319
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,223
- Take a ride with me?

1320
01:12:59,086 --> 01:12:59,919
- Okay.

1321
01:13:02,335 --> 01:13:03,585
- So beautiful.

1322
01:13:05,956 --> 01:13:09,372
(romantic hip hop music)

1323
01:13:22,908 --> 01:13:26,992
So this is my favorite thing to do.

1324
01:13:28,018 --> 01:13:29,658
Just to come out here and sit

1325
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,457
and catch the water from this spot.

1326
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:34,846
My mom, she used to take
me out here all the time

1327
01:13:34,896 --> 01:13:37,775
when I was little and she
would say how important it is

1328
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:38,938
to have peace in life.

1329
01:13:40,486 --> 01:13:44,463
And she would also say
that if you listen closely,

1330
01:13:44,513 --> 01:13:46,762
the sound of the waves
were like angel wings.

1331
01:13:48,741 --> 01:13:53,100
I know, it's silly, but
whenever I get a chance,

1332
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:57,938
I just love to come out here
and sit and listen and imagine

1333
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:03,266
that it's the wings of
my favorite angel. Her.

1334
01:14:07,771 --> 01:14:12,769
And um, oh, that sounded
so cheesy. (laughs)

1335
01:14:16,492 --> 01:14:20,924
- Nah, I actually
thought it was beautiful.

1336
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:27,925
- Oh wait, I'm, I'm sorry.

1337
01:14:29,055 --> 01:14:32,962
It's, it's not like that.
It's just, you know,

1338
01:14:33,012 --> 01:14:34,912
I don't really know you like that yet.

1339
01:14:37,085 --> 01:14:40,787
- Um it's cool. No worries.

1340
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:46,037
Have a feeling you'd be
worth the wait anyways.

1341
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:46,920
- Yeah?

1342
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:12,040
(soft piano music)

1343
01:15:29,086 --> 01:15:31,918
- What you looking all scared for?

1344
01:15:33,136 --> 01:15:34,449
And where you about to go?

1345
01:15:34,499 --> 01:15:35,407
- Out.

1346
01:15:35,457 --> 01:15:36,475
- Out?

1347
01:15:36,525 --> 01:15:38,914
- And what I tell you about
popping up at my house?

1348
01:15:38,964 --> 01:15:41,843
- Oh, first off, I didn't
pop up at your house,

1349
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:43,463
if you actually read your text messages,

1350
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:44,962
I told you I was coming over.

1351
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:54,112
It's there.

1352
01:15:55,726 --> 01:15:57,188
- Okay. And I didn't respond,

1353
01:15:57,238 --> 01:15:59,537
so technically this is still popping up.

1354
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:04,529
- Deante. I did not come
over here to argue with you.

1355
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,695
I came up here because I missed you.

1356
01:16:10,874 --> 01:16:13,176
Wow. So you just not gonna kiss me back?

1357
01:16:15,482 --> 01:16:16,732
Wow. You acting real fake right now.

1358
01:16:16,782 --> 01:16:19,601
You know what? What's been
going on with you lately?

1359
01:16:19,651 --> 01:16:20,980
You've been blowing me off,

1360
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:22,433
sending me one word text replies.

1361
01:16:22,483 --> 01:16:27,481
And you still acting like
you ain't want none of this.

1362
01:16:27,647 --> 01:16:31,223
- See the thing is, Trish,
I don't want none of this.

1363
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:32,263
I think we should take a break.

1364
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:34,138
- Take a break? We don't
need to take a break.

1365
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:36,012
What you mean take a break?

1366
01:16:36,062 --> 01:16:37,655
- What I mean is you and me

1367
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:39,720
ain't making me happy in life right now.

1368
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,410
And I don't wanna be with you.

1369
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:44,835
- What'd I do? How don't
I make you happy, Deante?

1370
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:49,171
- Look, Trish. Listen. We can
talk about this another time.

1371
01:16:49,221 --> 01:16:51,730
But right now I gotta go. So do you.

1372
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,632
- No we not-

1373
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:53,464
- I'm gonna need that key back too.

1374
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:54,297
- What?

1375
01:16:54,347 --> 01:16:55,519
- No, we're not talking about this later.

1376
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,751
We're gonna talk about this-Deante.

1377
01:16:57,801 --> 01:16:59,344
Are you serious right now?

1378
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:01,919
Wow. You are se-

1379
01:17:01,969 --> 01:17:02,752
- Bye Trish.

1380
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:05,178
- Bye? Okay. Wow. All right.

1381
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:12,473
You know what? Just know
I don't move backwards.

1382
01:17:12,523 --> 01:17:13,403
And when you start to miss me,

1383
01:17:13,453 --> 01:17:15,352
don't you even think about calling me.

1384
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:17,340
And here's your key.

1385
01:17:18,571 --> 01:17:19,404
- Trish, wait.

1386
01:17:23,505 --> 01:17:25,754
- I knew you wasn't stupid.

1387
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:39,665
- This the wrong key.

1388
01:17:42,723 --> 01:17:43,555
- Wow.

1389
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,568
Cannot believe you right now.
You can have all the keys.

1390
01:17:48,618 --> 01:17:50,902
Don't call my phone.

1391
01:17:50,952 --> 01:17:51,735
- Thank you.

1392
01:17:51,785 --> 01:17:52,617
- Bye.

1393
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:11,683
- Keep them closed. No peeking. I got you.

1394
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:12,935
- Okay. Okay.

1395
01:18:18,331 --> 01:18:19,685
Girl, where is you taking me?

1396
01:18:19,735 --> 01:18:22,386
- (laughs) You, you'll see.

1397
01:18:23,777 --> 01:18:24,609
Okay.

1398
01:18:26,776 --> 01:18:28,590
Come a little closer. Okay.

1399
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,987
Turn this way.

1400
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:31,719
No, look right that way.

1401
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:34,473
- Can I open my eyes now?

1402
01:18:34,523 --> 01:18:35,356
- Uh huh.

1403
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:43,218
I mean you said you never
went swimming before. So.

1404
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:46,184
(excited shouting)

1405
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:03,926
(splashing and laughing)

1406
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,592
(romantic R&B music)

1407
01:19:57,784 --> 01:20:00,419
- [Larry] Look who it is. The man himself.

1408
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:03,838
Thanks for finally blessing
us with your presence.

1409
01:20:07,742 --> 01:20:09,648
- Here you go.

1410
01:20:09,698 --> 01:20:11,697
I'm gonna holler at you.

1411
01:20:13,282 --> 01:20:16,051
- Hold on Tey. Let me holler
at you outside real quick, bro.

1412
01:20:29,609 --> 01:20:31,600
What's going on with you, bro?

1413
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:33,015
- What you mean?

1414
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:35,364
- Look, Deante. Don't
play stupid with me dog.

1415
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:37,527
Why I gotta call you five and six times

1416
01:20:37,577 --> 01:20:39,633
just to get a hold of you?

1417
01:20:39,683 --> 01:20:41,775
You do know we running
the business, right?

1418
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:44,071
And as the grower of that business,

1419
01:20:44,121 --> 01:20:47,190
don't you think you need to
be a little more available?

1420
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:49,260
- Have I ever missed a drop

1421
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:51,372
or missed anything that
you needed me to do?

1422
01:20:52,988 --> 01:20:55,498
All right then. I got
stuff going on right now.

1423
01:20:55,548 --> 01:20:57,047
- What stuff, Tey?

1424
01:20:57,097 --> 01:20:59,546
- My stuff. Nothing that
you need to worry about.

1425
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,255
- All right.

1426
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:04,395
Anyways, I talked to G,

1427
01:21:04,445 --> 01:21:06,304
he said he trying to meet tonight.

1428
01:21:06,354 --> 01:21:07,187
- About what?

1429
01:21:08,103 --> 01:21:09,752
- He ain't really say.

1430
01:21:09,802 --> 01:21:11,535
He said he'd rather to tell us in person.

1431
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,183
Tonight.

1432
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:23,828
- All right, man.

1433
01:21:25,657 --> 01:21:26,570
- 9 o'clock.

1434
01:21:33,296 --> 01:21:35,545
I'll be right back, fellas.

1435
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:44,321
- [Tiffany] So yeah.

1436
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:48,000
My dad said the boys are really
starting to come around so,

1437
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,749
yeah, I guess I'm proud of my dad.

1438
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,829
Deante? Deante?

1439
01:21:57,227 --> 01:21:59,006
Deante.

1440
01:21:59,056 --> 01:22:01,268
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

1441
01:22:02,225 --> 01:22:03,248
- Are you okay?

1442
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:07,196
- Yeah, I just got a lot
of my mind right now.

1443
01:22:08,953 --> 01:22:10,652
- Do you wanna talk about it?

1444
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:20,969
- I do. Like I really do,
but I just can't right now.

1445
01:22:23,548 --> 01:22:25,880
- Why what's, what's going on?

1446
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:42,231
- What's up, Deante?

1447
01:22:45,105 --> 01:22:46,521
- What's up, man?

1448
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,979
- Oh, oh I'm sorry. I'm being rude.

1449
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:54,287
How you doing? I'm Larry,
Deante's business partner.

1450
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:55,577
You are?

1451
01:22:55,627 --> 01:22:57,320
- I'm Tiffany. His girlfriend.

1452
01:22:59,286 --> 01:23:00,119
- Girlfriend?

1453
01:23:06,703 --> 01:23:08,723
Well aren't you the lucky guy, Deante.

1454
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:10,695
- Yes, he is.

1455
01:23:14,691 --> 01:23:15,870
- Well, I guess I better leave you two,

1456
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,272
I'm sure you got stuff to do, huh?

1457
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:20,502
Tonight, right?

1458
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:28,531
- (sighs) Yeah. Tonight.

1459
01:23:32,625 --> 01:23:34,611
- Nice meeting you.

1460
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:35,567
- You as well.

1461
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,929
So I'm assuming that's the partner

1462
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:51,378
to the business you still
haven't told me about?

1463
01:23:52,316 --> 01:23:54,857
- (sighs) Baby.

1464
01:23:54,907 --> 01:23:57,946
I told you. I don't even
think I wanna do it anymore.

1465
01:23:57,996 --> 01:23:59,446
- Well, does Larry know that?

1466
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:08,003
- Nah, but he will.

1467
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,811
- Bro. What the hell was that?

1468
01:24:25,887 --> 01:24:28,219
- I don't know. You tell me.

1469
01:24:30,386 --> 01:24:33,944
Hm. You know, there was a time

1470
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:35,843
when we was really like best friends.

1471
01:24:36,843 --> 01:24:38,425
We used to tell each other everything.

1472
01:24:41,002 --> 01:24:43,051
We even had this big, crazy ass dream

1473
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:44,893
of taking over the world together.

1474
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:51,238
- Yeah? There was a time my best friend

1475
01:24:51,288 --> 01:24:52,538
wasn't a murderer either.

1476
01:24:59,825 --> 01:25:01,025
- Let me get this right.

1477
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:05,086
So that's what all this is about?

1478
01:25:06,283 --> 01:25:09,502
You mad at me because I'm out
here making sure people know

1479
01:25:09,552 --> 01:25:10,702
we ain't playing games?

1480
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:17,096
No, you mad at me because I'm out here

1481
01:25:17,146 --> 01:25:20,008
making sure you can
sleep peaceful at night?

1482
01:25:20,058 --> 01:25:21,708
- Do you ever listen to yourself?

1483
01:25:23,177 --> 01:25:24,667
Yeah, that's right. We are best friends.

1484
01:25:24,717 --> 01:25:25,793
Which means I know you

1485
01:25:25,843 --> 01:25:27,723
and while the whole city
may think you this gangster

1486
01:25:27,773 --> 01:25:28,988
you trying to act like,

1487
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:32,877
you just Larry to me.

1488
01:25:34,324 --> 01:25:37,415
You used to pee in the
bed in high school, Larry.

1489
01:25:40,461 --> 01:25:45,460
And I'm not Trey, Lil Mag,
Peewee or none of them.

1490
01:25:47,019 --> 01:25:49,945
Which means I'm not scared of you.

1491
01:25:51,023 --> 01:25:51,806
- Yeah?

1492
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:52,688
- Yeah.

1493
01:25:59,925 --> 01:26:01,274
- Well maybe you should be.

1494
01:26:07,672 --> 01:26:08,505
- [G] My guy.

1495
01:26:09,892 --> 01:26:10,934
- G from Cleveland.

1496
01:26:17,299 --> 01:26:18,082
Sup, homie.

1497
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:19,478
- Hey, my apologies for being late,

1498
01:26:19,528 --> 01:26:21,588
I ran into some construction on the way.

1499
01:26:21,638 --> 01:26:23,687
- Don't worry about it, G.

1500
01:26:23,737 --> 01:26:25,786
But what's this secret you holding on to?

1501
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:28,020
- It ain't no secret.

1502
01:26:28,945 --> 01:26:31,294
I just need to look in your
eyes to know if I can trust you

1503
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:35,526
when I tell you I need 50
pounds, in like four months.

1504
01:26:38,072 --> 01:26:40,351
Huh? I understand. I
know that's a big order

1505
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:42,261
and a quick turnaround.

1506
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:45,063
That's why I'll pay you up front.

1507
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:47,812
There's 125,000 in there.

1508
01:26:48,839 --> 01:26:51,578
With that amount, start a new grow.

1509
01:26:51,628 --> 01:26:53,277
Get the production moving faster.

1510
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:58,095
- Sound like you got it
all figured out to me, G.

1511
01:26:58,145 --> 01:26:58,978
- I do.

1512
01:27:00,115 --> 01:27:02,644
I just need to know. Can you do it?

1513
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:08,375
- Give us a second, G.

1514
01:27:09,262 --> 01:27:10,388
- Take your time.

1515
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,694
- Yo, that's a lot of weed, L.

1516
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:24,360
- No. It's a lot of money.

1517
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:29,408
Are you serious right now,
Tey? Man, we doing this, bro.

1518
01:27:29,492 --> 01:27:30,275
- You acting like

1519
01:27:30,325 --> 01:27:31,774
you're gonna be the one
responsible for growing it.

1520
01:27:31,824 --> 01:27:33,354
- You right.

1521
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:35,858
Which is why we make a hell of a team.

1522
01:27:35,908 --> 01:27:36,729
Now can we please go make this deal

1523
01:27:36,779 --> 01:27:38,165
before he change his mind?

1524
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:50,448
- Yo, G. We got you, bro.

1525
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:51,797
- [G] As I knew you would.

1526
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,796
Now Larry,

1527
01:27:54,846 --> 01:27:58,115
please don't make me have
to come looking for you.

1528
01:27:58,165 --> 01:28:03,116
I would hate for our partnership
to spoil over stupidity.

1529
01:28:05,356 --> 01:28:06,188
You getting me?

1530
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:08,665
- Loud and clear, G.

1531
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:11,341
- All right, fellas.

1532
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:14,673
I'll be in touch.

1533
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:46,972
- B-boy, what is wrong with you?

1534
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,518
- What I do?

1535
01:28:49,568 --> 01:28:51,830
- Well, you didn't announce yourself.

1536
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,879
- It's 'cause you always tell me not to.

1537
01:28:55,076 --> 01:28:57,715
- I said don't come in my house yelling.

1538
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:01,434
I ain't never said to come
in here like a doggone ninja

1539
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:04,233
and scare me half to death. Woo.

1540
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:06,102
Feel like you gave me a heart attack

1541
01:29:07,122 --> 01:29:09,764
and what is wrong with your face?

1542
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:13,370
Okay. What's got you all bent outta shape?

1543
01:29:15,997 --> 01:29:16,830
Deante.

1544
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:20,737
- Nothing. I'm all right.

1545
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:24,676
- Deante, when you were a little boy,

1546
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:28,285
I used to whoop your tail
because you weren't a good liar

1547
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:30,401
and you're still not.

1548
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:32,710
Now what is going on,
what's wrong with you?

1549
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:40,893
Aw don't think I still
can't sling a belt now.

1550
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:45,211
- I know grandma.

1551
01:29:46,449 --> 01:29:49,807
It's just that I'm in the
phase of my life right now

1552
01:29:49,857 --> 01:29:52,886
where I don't know what to do.

1553
01:29:52,936 --> 01:29:56,595
Like I know what I'm supposed
to do, but I just can't.

1554
01:30:00,774 --> 01:30:02,373
- Baby have you prayed about it?

1555
01:30:03,913 --> 01:30:06,382
- Come on, grandma. You
know I don't do all that.

1556
01:30:06,432 --> 01:30:08,981
- Once upon a time, you
didn't go to church either.

1557
01:30:10,301 --> 01:30:11,873
It's funny what time can do.

1558
01:30:12,934 --> 01:30:14,219
And you'd be you surprised that

1559
01:30:14,269 --> 01:30:18,171
what spending just a little
time with God will do for you.

1560
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:24,346
But whether or not you pray,
the Deante that I raised

1561
01:30:24,636 --> 01:30:27,915
was always smart enough
to make the right choice.

1562
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:30,014
And I can't see that changing in you now.

1563
01:30:36,386 --> 01:30:38,451
- Thanks, grandma.

1564
01:30:38,501 --> 01:30:41,550
- Oh, don't thank me. I
just told you the truth.

1565
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,272
You got to do the rest. Now you hungry?

1566
01:30:47,938 --> 01:30:48,801
- You know I am.

1567
01:30:49,847 --> 01:30:52,349
- Hey dad, can you come
in here for a minute?

1568
01:30:53,422 --> 01:30:54,754
- [Steven] Yeah.

1569
01:30:57,796 --> 01:31:02,523
- (singing) Happy birthday to you.

1570
01:31:02,573 --> 01:31:06,562
Happy birthday to you.

1571
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:10,870
Happy birthday to dad.

1572
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,546
Happy birthday to you.

1573
01:31:15,415 --> 01:31:16,197
Happy birthday.

1574
01:31:16,247 --> 01:31:17,808
- So this why you didn't want
me in the kitchen earlier?

1575
01:31:17,858 --> 01:31:20,207
- Yeah, 'cause I was
making your favorite cake.

1576
01:31:21,107 --> 01:31:22,206
- Where all my candles?

1577
01:31:22,256 --> 01:31:24,398
- Oh, you don't need none of that.

1578
01:31:25,275 --> 01:31:28,274
- Nah, thank you so much, Tweetie.

1579
01:31:28,324 --> 01:31:31,886
Like you really mean the
world to me. You really do.

1580
01:31:33,962 --> 01:31:35,816
- Aw dad.

1581
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:37,971
Well you'll forever be my favorite guy.

1582
01:31:38,021 --> 01:31:40,180
Even though you are getting a little old.

1583
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,618
- We'll see how long I
stay your favorite guy.

1584
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:47,618
- What do you mean?

1585
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:51,270
What?

1586
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,146
- Deante might be taking my spot?

1587
01:31:52,196 --> 01:31:55,225
- Oh, no. Are you jealous?

1588
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,058
- No I'm not jealous.

1589
01:31:56,108 --> 01:31:56,891
- You jealous.

1590
01:31:56,941 --> 01:31:59,225
- I'm not lying either, but you know,

1591
01:31:59,275 --> 01:32:04,032
but it's cool. He seems like a nice kid.

1592
01:32:04,082 --> 01:32:06,501
- Yeah, he is.

1593
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:07,334
- Yeah?

1594
01:32:07,384 --> 01:32:08,191
- Yeah.

1595
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:09,762
- Okay. Well tuck them teeth in.

1596
01:32:09,812 --> 01:32:11,347
- Oh sorry. (laughs)

1597
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:14,097
- Please. All that cheese.
And can you cut your dad

1598
01:32:14,147 --> 01:32:15,468
a piece of cake on his birthday too?

1599
01:32:16,018 --> 01:32:16,978
- Yes, dad.

1600
01:32:17,028 --> 01:32:17,844
Um how big?

1601
01:32:17,894 --> 01:32:20,290
- Thank you so much. It looks
absolutely-aw look how-

1602
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,229
look at that.

1603
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,226
(phone ringing)

1604
01:32:28,154 --> 01:32:28,987
- Hello?

1605
01:32:29,984 --> 01:32:31,033
- [Tiffany] Hey babe.

1606
01:32:33,872 --> 01:32:35,862
- Hey baby. What you doing?

1607
01:32:35,912 --> 01:32:38,384
- Just had a birthday
celebration for my dad.

1608
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,060
- It's his birthday?

1609
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,892
Why didn't you tell me?

1610
01:32:41,942 --> 01:32:43,969
I would've came to
celebrate it with y'all.

1611
01:32:46,078 --> 01:32:46,978
- Yeah, I know.

1612
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:50,756
But um birthdays are still
kind of our thing, you know,

1613
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:51,806
missing mom and all.

1614
01:32:53,915 --> 01:32:55,315
- I feel that, I understand.

1615
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:01,873
- Hey so what I'm about to do

1616
01:33:01,923 --> 01:33:06,281
is definitely something you do
in person, but I don't know,

1617
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:07,981
the spirit just hit me.

1618
01:33:08,031 --> 01:33:10,410
And I just wanted to tell you that

1619
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:15,398
I love you, Deante Miller

1620
01:33:15,448 --> 01:33:18,627
and I don't know what
the future holds for us,

1621
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:21,616
but right now you make me so happy.

1622
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:24,325
And I'm so blessed that
God brought us together

1623
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:26,544
and I'm, I'm gonna stop talking now

1624
01:33:26,594 --> 01:33:28,244
because I feel like I'm rambling.

1625
01:33:31,363 --> 01:33:34,109
- Hey, I love you too.

1626
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,311
You don't know how happy you make me

1627
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:40,603
and how much you helped
me change, in a good way.

1628
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:43,658
- Yeah?

1629
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:50,528
Okay. So um what do you say
we try this again in person?

1630
01:33:55,645 --> 01:33:56,644
- I would love that.

1631
01:33:57,574 --> 01:33:58,407
- Yeah?

1632
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:04,612
So tomorrow. Have a good
rest of your evening, baby.

1633
01:34:07,315 --> 01:34:08,147
- You too.

1634
01:34:17,938 --> 01:34:18,771
- Oh.

1635
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:35,515
(knocking at the door)

1636
01:34:46,469 --> 01:34:47,252
- What's good?

1637
01:34:47,302 --> 01:34:48,469
- What up dog?

1638
01:34:52,591 --> 01:34:54,185
- Man I don't know what's
going on with you and G

1639
01:34:54,235 --> 01:34:58,233
and this all of a sudden
gotta speak in person stuff.

1640
01:34:58,283 --> 01:35:01,372
But you do realize it's
nine in the morning, bro?

1641
01:35:01,422 --> 01:35:03,135
This couldn't have waited till later?

1642
01:35:05,011 --> 01:35:07,203
- Nah. Couldn't.

1643
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:10,539
- Okay. So what's going on?

1644
01:35:12,584 --> 01:35:17,347
I'm out.

1645
01:35:17,397 --> 01:35:18,297
- Outta what, Tey?

1646
01:35:19,376 --> 01:35:21,868
- I'm out the game,
done with all this, man.

1647
01:35:24,914 --> 01:35:25,764
- No, you're not.

1648
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:28,763
You might just be mad at me or something,

1649
01:35:30,163 --> 01:35:32,205
you just got paid 60K bro.

1650
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,451
Ain't no way you walking
away from that, Tey.

1651
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:40,172
No way, you playing with me, gotta be.

1652
01:35:47,377 --> 01:35:48,666
- Take it.

1653
01:35:48,716 --> 01:35:50,909
It's all there, but I'm done.

1654
01:35:55,744 --> 01:35:57,693
- What's really going on with you, bro?

1655
01:35:58,763 --> 01:36:00,975
We pray for these type of times, Tey.

1656
01:36:02,172 --> 01:36:04,064
And now that the moment finally here,

1657
01:36:05,621 --> 01:36:06,870
you trying to quit on me?

1658
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,431
Come on, think about what you saying Tey.

1659
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:17,397
- I know exactly what I'm
saying and you're right.

1660
01:36:17,447 --> 01:36:18,736
I used to pray for times like this,

1661
01:36:18,786 --> 01:36:21,718
but I'm not about that no more, man.

1662
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,304
- Do you hear yourself, bro?

1663
01:36:27,613 --> 01:36:29,663
You're a drug dealer, Deante.

1664
01:36:31,782 --> 01:36:34,381
So what you mean? That's
not what you about no more?

1665
01:36:35,401 --> 01:36:36,903
Of course it is.

1666
01:36:38,474 --> 01:36:39,729
And you just gonna gimme this money

1667
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:41,729
like it's supposed to settle something?

1668
01:36:42,878 --> 01:36:45,397
So what you expecting me to do Tey?

1669
01:36:45,447 --> 01:36:47,007
Hmm?

1670
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:49,046
Call G and be like, oh yeah bro,

1671
01:36:49,096 --> 01:36:51,178
we ain't gonna be able
to make do on that order.

1672
01:36:52,795 --> 01:36:53,744
I'm not doing that.

1673
01:36:55,254 --> 01:36:58,223
- Yeah. That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1674
01:36:58,273 --> 01:37:01,125
Call him up. Give him his money back.

1675
01:37:01,175 --> 01:37:02,455
Tell him we thought we
could deliver on the order,

1676
01:37:02,504 --> 01:37:03,832
but we can't.

1677
01:37:03,882 --> 01:37:05,548
- No. This my money.

1678
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:10,999
We earn the right to
take these type of deals.

1679
01:37:11,908 --> 01:37:13,388
We was the ones out there all day,

1680
01:37:13,438 --> 01:37:15,030
all night, grinding for this.

1681
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,496
And now you're quitting on me dog?

1682
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:25,833
You know what?

1683
01:37:27,273 --> 01:37:30,032
I'm willing to bet you
everything in this bag,

1684
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:32,131
it's that trick that got you tripping on.

1685
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,733
Well news flash, Deante,

1686
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,131
females like that come
a dime a dozen, bro.

1687
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:43,957
I'll buy you another herd tomorrow.

1688
01:37:55,157 --> 01:37:59,072
- You ever disrespect
her again, I'll kill you.

1689
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:05,343
Get the hell outta my house.

1690
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:24,727
- (laughs) I got you.

1691
01:38:52,928 --> 01:38:55,510
- [Trey] So what we gonna do L?

1692
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:10,268
Man I know you not
about to let that slide.

1693
01:39:10,318 --> 01:39:15,317
Even if it is Deante, you
gotta break his arms, legs,

1694
01:39:15,796 --> 01:39:16,629
something.

1695
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:19,835
- Bro. Arms, legs.

1696
01:39:19,885 --> 01:39:22,076
We need to put that man
in a wheelchair, ill.

1697
01:39:22,126 --> 01:39:23,744
- If y'all not trying to die today,

1698
01:39:23,794 --> 01:39:25,593
just shut the hell up talking to me.

1699
01:39:40,968 --> 01:39:42,151
- It's nice out, right?

1700
01:39:42,201 --> 01:39:44,114
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

1701
01:39:44,164 --> 01:39:46,309
That's why it's my favorite.

1702
01:39:49,158 --> 01:39:51,151
You gonna tell me why
you brought me back here?

1703
01:39:51,201 --> 01:39:52,231
- In a minute.

1704
01:39:52,281 --> 01:39:53,614
- Oh okay, okay.

1705
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:58,073
(soulful music)

1706
01:40:12,402 --> 01:40:13,235
Oh.

1707
01:40:15,846 --> 01:40:17,003
Man. Look at you.

1708
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:20,088
You being all thoughtful
and romantic and stuff.

1709
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:24,635
- Well, I figured this is
your favorite thing to do,

1710
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,913
one night at your favorite spot.

1711
01:40:26,963 --> 01:40:28,702
- Oh, you remembered that?

1712
01:40:29,842 --> 01:40:30,791
I was just kidding.

1713
01:40:41,351 --> 01:40:42,683
- Well, I'm not.

1714
01:40:47,796 --> 01:40:50,912
Tiffany, I'm in love with you.

1715
01:40:54,094 --> 01:40:58,762
And the crazy thing is, I don't
even know when it happened.

1716
01:40:58,812 --> 01:41:01,781
Maybe all those late
night, deep conversations

1717
01:41:01,831 --> 01:41:05,500
over the phone or us just
spending time with each other

1718
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,949
these last couple of months,

1719
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:09,948
or maybe it happened first time I saw you

1720
01:41:09,998 --> 01:41:11,548
at the community service thing.

1721
01:41:14,956 --> 01:41:17,679
But all I know is you make me so happy.

1722
01:41:19,455 --> 01:41:23,197
And this feeling's kind of new for me,

1723
01:41:25,453 --> 01:41:28,832
so I guess what I'm trying to say is

1724
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:34,153
thanks for showing me what true love is.

1725
01:41:41,579 --> 01:41:42,901
Well, don't cry.

1726
01:41:42,951 --> 01:41:47,949
- It's okay. I love you too, Deante.

1727
01:41:48,382 --> 01:41:50,357
And you make me so happy.

1728
01:41:51,894 --> 01:41:56,195
So what do you say we do our
best to keep this happy going?

1729
01:41:57,522 --> 01:41:58,355
- I promise.

1730
01:42:22,233 --> 01:42:23,015
- Hey.

1731
01:42:23,065 --> 01:42:24,653
- Hey.

1732
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:28,742
- So you've really never
watched a chick flick before?

1733
01:42:28,791 --> 01:42:29,574
- No?

1734
01:42:29,624 --> 01:42:31,960
- Oh my goodness. Mm mm.

1735
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:33,300
You're definitely watching one today.

1736
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,430
- Ugh do we got to?

1737
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:38,831
- Yes. Yes. It's happening. (laughs)

1738
01:42:42,017 --> 01:42:42,850
- Deante.

1739
01:42:50,056 --> 01:42:52,306
Should have killed me, bro.

1740
01:42:53,263 --> 01:42:55,512
(gun shot)

1741
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,082
- Somebody help.

1742
01:43:40,955 --> 01:43:42,954
(cries)

1743
01:43:44,706 --> 01:43:47,455
My baby, please wake up. Wake up.

1744
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:54,036
Somebody help me.

1745
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:58,949
(mournful piano music)

1746
01:44:05,488 --> 01:44:06,855
- Hello?

1747
01:44:06,905 --> 01:44:07,905
This is him.

1748
01:44:11,137 --> 01:44:11,970
What?

1749
01:44:14,376 --> 01:44:15,458
Tiffany Simmons?

1750
01:44:17,945 --> 01:44:19,667
No, you got the wrong person.

1751
01:44:21,623 --> 01:44:25,952
No. No, no. She, she.

1752
01:44:29,106 --> 01:44:30,617
Oh God.

1753
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:40,226
My baby, oh God, you took my baby.

1754
01:44:40,352 --> 01:44:42,343
(sobbing)

1755
01:44:42,393 --> 01:44:44,476
Oh God. You took my baby.

1756
01:44:49,015 --> 01:44:49,848
Oh Lord.

1757
01:44:53,764 --> 01:44:55,513
God you took my baby.

1758
01:44:57,305 --> 01:44:59,305
(cries)

1759
01:45:33,585 --> 01:45:34,866
- Bro, what is you doing?

1760
01:45:34,916 --> 01:45:36,118
I did that move before,
you ain't say nothing.

1761
01:45:36,168 --> 01:45:37,450
Now you talking?

1762
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,283
- [Street Kid] I know you was cheating.

1763
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,652
That's why I don't like playing
cards with you. Just janky.

1764
01:45:45,435 --> 01:45:47,784
Yo OG. My condolences, man.

1765
01:45:47,834 --> 01:45:48,617
- Yeah, Mr. Simmons.

1766
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:50,573
Really, really sorry to
hear about your daughter.

1767
01:45:50,623 --> 01:45:53,272
- Yeah. Thank you. Thank you and all.

1768
01:45:53,322 --> 01:45:55,122
Hey, but I came here for one reason.

1769
01:45:56,811 --> 01:45:58,984
Who killed my daughter?

1770
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:05,590
- I don't know, OG.

1771
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,961
- [Steven] Who killed her?

1772
01:46:08,011 --> 01:46:09,294
Huh?

1773
01:46:09,344 --> 01:46:10,965
Who killed her? You owe it to me.

1774
01:46:11,015 --> 01:46:13,079
You hear me? Eh, you owe it to me.

1775
01:46:13,129 --> 01:46:15,115
Who killed my daughter?

1776
01:46:15,165 --> 01:46:16,815
- Yo Mr. Simmons, you seem drunk.

1777
01:46:16,865 --> 01:46:17,697
Just sit down.

1778
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,136
- [Steven] I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

1779
01:46:23,362 --> 01:46:25,342
Who killed my daughter?

1780
01:46:25,392 --> 01:46:27,171
You see the police won't give me nothing.

1781
01:46:27,221 --> 01:46:28,691
And I can't find her boyfriend,

1782
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:30,390
but you know one thing I do know.

1783
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:33,109
I know these streets be talking.

1784
01:46:35,028 --> 01:46:36,568
So I know y'all know.

1785
01:46:36,618 --> 01:46:38,670
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1786
01:46:39,796 --> 01:46:41,769
Who killed my daughter?

1787
01:46:44,294 --> 01:46:46,161
- I don't know if it's true,

1788
01:46:46,211 --> 01:46:49,157
the streets is talking
some dealer named Larry.

1789
01:46:53,422 --> 01:46:58,421
- Larry. Where he roll at?

1790
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:00,278
- Mr. Simmons-

1791
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:02,405
- Oh you don't know.

1792
01:47:02,455 --> 01:47:03,866
Where he roll at?

1793
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:05,278
Put your hands on the table.

1794
01:47:05,328 --> 01:47:06,565
- See-

1795
01:47:06,615 --> 01:47:07,814
- Put your hands on the table.

1796
01:47:10,244 --> 01:47:11,076
Now.

1797
01:47:12,243 --> 01:47:13,909
Where Larry roll at?

1798
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,632
- Tweetie, I,

1799
01:47:34,761 --> 01:47:39,760
I know I'll never see
you or moms again, but

1800
01:47:45,075 --> 01:47:45,918
this is for you.

1801
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:48,805
The fuck, man.

1802
01:47:48,855 --> 01:47:50,521
Man, what you doing?

1803
01:47:51,729 --> 01:47:53,572
That's it, hell no, no man.

1804
01:47:53,622 --> 01:47:55,114
Get away. No, no, no.

1805
01:47:56,479 --> 01:47:58,561
Hey, hey, fuckin' no man.

1806
01:48:06,018 --> 01:48:06,882
- Open the door. Steven.

1807
01:48:06,932 --> 01:48:07,756
- No man.

1808
01:48:07,806 --> 01:48:09,171
- Open the door.

1809
01:48:09,221 --> 01:48:10,423
- You wasn't stop me from doing it.

1810
01:48:10,473 --> 01:48:11,806
- Open the door.

1811
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:18,454
- You cannot do this to me. (cries)

1812
01:48:22,802 --> 01:48:23,635
- Steven.

1813
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:27,833
This what you gonna do?
Go in, guns blazing?

1814
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:29,791
- Yes it's what I'm gonna do.

1815
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:30,639
- Is this what Tiffany would want?

1816
01:48:30,689 --> 01:48:32,542
- What? Don't. Hey don't say,

1817
01:48:32,592 --> 01:48:34,431
ooh don't say her name.

1818
01:48:35,298 --> 01:48:37,527
Do not say her name.

1819
01:48:38,839 --> 01:48:39,838
You hear me?

1820
01:48:44,797 --> 01:48:47,537
(sobbing)

1821
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:48,410
- But at least right now

1822
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,673
when you have a chance to
see them in heaven again.

1823
01:48:50,723 --> 01:48:51,555
- What?

1824
01:48:52,922 --> 01:48:55,721
- Well not if you continue
to go down this path, Steven.

1825
01:49:01,089 --> 01:49:02,412
Look how far you've come.

1826
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,017
You've changed the lives of two young men

1827
01:49:06,067 --> 01:49:08,071
that think the world of you.

1828
01:49:08,121 --> 01:49:09,920
They look at you like a big brother.

1829
01:49:11,656 --> 01:49:15,637
So much that the very
second that you went,

1830
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:17,677
they came and got me Steven.

1831
01:49:19,156 --> 01:49:20,972
'Cause they didn't wanna see you go.

1832
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:24,562
You're an inspiration. Not a killer.

1833
01:49:24,612 --> 01:49:27,773
- (screams) No, I don't care.

1834
01:49:27,823 --> 01:49:29,709
I'm gonna kill 'em, I swear.

1835
01:49:29,759 --> 01:49:30,819
- First Peter three, nine.

1836
01:49:30,869 --> 01:49:32,146
- I'm gonna kill 'em.

1837
01:49:34,018 --> 01:49:36,117
- Never repay evil with evil, Steven.

1838
01:49:36,167 --> 01:49:37,507
- I'm gonna kill 'em.

1839
01:49:37,557 --> 01:49:39,009
- No insult with insult,

1840
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,458
but the contrary. Repay
evil with a blessing

1841
01:49:45,664 --> 01:49:48,883
because the debt, you
would inherit a blessing.

1842
01:49:48,933 --> 01:49:50,655
- Oh a blessing?

1843
01:49:50,705 --> 01:49:54,654
Tiffany was my blessing.
That's all I had left.

1844
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:57,720
- There is so much more for you, Steven.

1845
01:49:57,770 --> 01:49:58,630
- How could He?

1846
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:02,398
- If I was to guess, God
has so much more for you,

1847
01:50:02,448 --> 01:50:04,675
but not if you continue
down this route, Steven.

1848
01:50:04,725 --> 01:50:06,287
- Oh God.

1849
01:50:06,337 --> 01:50:08,366
- You can overcome this.

1850
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:11,185
You can Steven, but you
have to let go of the gun

1851
01:50:11,235 --> 01:50:12,590
and take God's hand.

1852
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,657
- Ah Tweetie no.

1853
01:50:15,554 --> 01:50:17,856
- Steven, please give me the gun.

1854
01:50:19,637 --> 01:50:21,671
Please, son, let go.

1855
01:50:21,721 --> 01:50:24,114
Please trust God, Steven. Just trust God.

1856
01:50:27,261 --> 01:50:29,542
You can, you can do it.

1857
01:50:29,592 --> 01:50:30,584
- I swear.

1858
01:50:30,634 --> 01:50:32,800
(sobbing)

1859
01:50:42,381 --> 01:50:44,701
- I got you, my son. I got you.

1860
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:47,287
- Oh my daughter no no.

1861
01:50:47,337 --> 01:50:49,202
- I know, Steven. I know,
I'm gonna walk with you.

1862
01:50:49,252 --> 01:50:52,334
- I wanna kill them. No, my daughter.

1863
01:50:53,571 --> 01:50:55,371
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

1864
01:51:00,209 --> 01:51:04,348
Last week, we buried someone

1865
01:51:05,507 --> 01:51:06,537
whom I believe

1866
01:51:07,826 --> 01:51:11,568
was a light in all of our darkness.

1867
01:51:13,454 --> 01:51:17,506
Sister Tiffany Simmons was very special.

1868
01:51:19,442 --> 01:51:23,104
Her smile was infectious,

1869
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:28,070
and her spirit was one

1870
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,891
whom I know God had
just injected into her.

1871
01:51:38,356 --> 01:51:43,354
She will forever be in our
hearts and in this church.

1872
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:51,864
Tiffany would say, just get
to know Him a little better.

1873
01:51:52,781 --> 01:51:54,664
You see that was her thing, Church.

1874
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,392
She never judged anyone.

1875
01:51:59,549 --> 01:52:01,561
She just loved life.

1876
01:52:02,928 --> 01:52:04,842
And she loved God.

1877
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:05,992
- [Church Member] Yes.

1878
01:52:09,596 --> 01:52:14,594
- Now every Sunday, we would invite those

1879
01:52:15,294 --> 01:52:19,555
who were ready to give
their lives to the Lord.

1880
01:52:23,221 --> 01:52:24,503
But on this Sunday.

1881
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:26,470
- [Church Member] Yes.

1882
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,909
- I wanted to take a page

1883
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:32,621
out of my dear friend Tiffany's book.

1884
01:52:35,307 --> 01:52:36,140
And just say,

1885
01:52:38,446 --> 01:52:42,538
if you feel that you
want to get to know Him

1886
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:46,505
a little better then come on down.

1887
01:52:51,504 --> 01:52:56,502
Will there be one? Come on down.

1888
01:53:00,784 --> 01:53:02,284
Will there be one?

1889
01:53:06,871 --> 01:53:08,371
Will there be one?

1890
01:53:26,867 --> 01:53:29,783
- Thank you, Jesus. Thank you Lord.

1891
01:53:31,824 --> 01:53:34,240
- [Church Member] Hallelujah.

1892
01:53:49,067 --> 01:53:51,483
(whispering)

1893
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:06,309
- Be strong.

1894
01:54:19,307 --> 01:54:20,140
- I um

1895
01:54:24,643 --> 01:54:25,860
- I shouldn't be here.

1896
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:35,128
Nah.

1897
01:54:35,178 --> 01:54:40,176
I should be dead right now.

1898
01:54:40,342 --> 01:54:44,173
See, I don't know if I'd
be in heaven or hell,

1899
01:54:53,254 --> 01:54:56,420
but I know I should be dead right now.

1900
01:55:02,168 --> 01:55:03,168
But I'm not.

1901
01:55:08,206 --> 01:55:10,206
It's because of Tiffany.

1902
01:55:15,653 --> 01:55:16,486
So Tiffany-

1903
01:55:19,072 --> 01:55:21,928
- [Church Member] Take your
time. Let the Lord listen.

1904
01:55:30,697 --> 01:55:32,696
(cries)

1905
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:47,262
- Tiffany jumped in front
of a gun and took a bullet

1906
01:55:47,312 --> 01:55:48,355
that was meant for me.

1907
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:55,362
So now she's gone, but I'm still here.

1908
01:56:01,757 --> 01:56:03,010
- [Pastor] Thank you, Jesus.

1909
01:56:05,856 --> 01:56:09,338
- See the thing is, Mr.
Simmons, your daughter,

1910
01:56:10,514 --> 01:56:12,147
she meant everything to me.

1911
01:56:15,393 --> 01:56:16,805
She got me out the streets.

1912
01:56:17,962 --> 01:56:19,661
She's the one who changed my life.

1913
01:56:25,419 --> 01:56:27,269
She never even knew I ran the streets

1914
01:56:28,878 --> 01:56:31,677
'cause I was too much of a
coward to tell her the truth.

1915
01:56:37,677 --> 01:56:39,759
I was scared to lose her.

1916
01:56:41,134 --> 01:56:42,613
I was scared to lose the woman I love,

1917
01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:43,683
the woman who helped me out the streets,

1918
01:56:43,733 --> 01:56:44,953
the woman who helped me find God,

1919
01:56:45,003 --> 01:56:46,252
and the woman I just knew

1920
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,293
that I would spend the
rest of my life with.

1921
01:56:59,003 --> 01:56:59,836
But,

1922
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:09,790
I guess not.

1923
01:57:12,693 --> 01:57:16,765
See, I never knew God could
ever love somebody like me.

1924
01:57:19,681 --> 01:57:23,750
So I figured, since I'm
on my way to hell anyways,

1925
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:28,798
I might as well make a little
money and live my best life.

1926
01:57:35,935 --> 01:57:37,348
But it wasn't my best life.

1927
01:57:41,404 --> 01:57:42,603
I've done a lot of dirt.

1928
01:57:46,632 --> 01:57:47,569
Like. A lot.

1929
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,010
But despite all that,

1930
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:54,889
she showed me that it's never too late

1931
01:57:54,939 --> 01:57:56,139
to start living for Him.

1932
01:57:59,707 --> 01:58:01,857
So I'm here because

1933
01:58:03,666 --> 01:58:05,865
I believe this is where
she'd want me to be.

1934
01:58:12,613 --> 01:58:14,213
I'm ready to give it all to God.

1935
01:58:15,562 --> 01:58:18,561
(audience cheering)

1936
01:58:31,219 --> 01:58:33,135
If he'll still have me.

1937
01:58:37,405 --> 01:58:42,403
And I'm here today because even
though I know I'm not worthy

1938
01:58:45,172 --> 01:58:48,974
and uh I know I don't deserve it,

1939
01:58:54,269 --> 01:58:56,518
I'm here today to ask
for forgiveness 'cause,

1940
01:59:10,708 --> 01:59:12,625
I can't forgive myself.

1941
01:59:16,581 --> 01:59:18,529
- It's all right.

1942
01:59:18,579 --> 01:59:20,070
- I can't forgive myself, Pas.

1943
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:21,537
- It's all right.

1944
01:59:22,494 --> 01:59:25,076
It's all right. It's all right.

1945
01:59:26,493 --> 01:59:29,075
It's all right. It's all right.

1946
01:59:31,287 --> 01:59:36,285
It's all right. Place your
hands in the Father's hands.

1947
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:40,740
It's all right.

1948
01:59:43,655 --> 01:59:46,022
God's hands will forgive you.

1949
01:59:46,072 --> 01:59:47,938
- I believe it but,

1950
01:59:47,988 --> 01:59:51,737
- Yes. Stay strong. Stay
strong. Stay strong.

1951
02:00:20,894 --> 02:00:23,173
- [Pastor] Hallelujah.

1952
02:00:23,223 --> 02:00:26,008
(cheering and applause)

1953
02:00:26,058 --> 02:00:26,975
Hallelujah.

1954
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,332
- Larry, Larry, Larry.

1955
02:01:23,099 --> 02:01:26,891
Now didn't I tell you not to
make me come looking for you?

1956
02:01:45,362 --> 02:01:48,278
(upbeat R&B music)
