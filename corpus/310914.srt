1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:03,796
After his appalling first round,
he won't survive the cut.

2
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,384
What on earth are they
going on about?

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,970
Ted Ray's just broken
the course scoring record.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,392
By Jove,
Ray's tied for second!

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,697
Mr. Ouimet?
One question, sir!

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,699
Francis!

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,577
Hey! I thought you'd
gone back to college!

8
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,788
I thought you quit playing!
- I guess I changed my mind, huh?

9
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,582
That's wonderful!
- Yeah.

10
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,084
It's great to see you.
Can you come tomorrow?

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,504
I have to leave tomorrow!
- Come back tomorrow!

12
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,596
Are you his caddie?

13
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,808
Give this to him, would you?

14
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,271
For luck.

15
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,905
Dames. Who needs 'em?

16
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,800
Fine play today, Mr. Ouimet.

17
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,385
Thank you, sir. You too.

18
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,389
It's mostly dumb luck, though.

19
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,977
On my part.
Not on your part.

20
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,105
You don't need luck.
I need luck.

21
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,901
Well, good luck, then.

22
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,403
Thank you, sir.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,374
I cleaned 'em good.
Wiped the grips too.

24
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,086
You did just fine
out there today.

25
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,587
You too, Francis.

26
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,382
You gonna be able to skip
school again tomorrow?

27
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,092
Let 'em try and stop me.

28
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,803
All right,
well, you get home safe.

29
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,680
Hey, don't you worry about me.

30
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,306
I'll meet you right here.

31
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,975
Early bird gets the worm.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,184
Deal.

33
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,584
All I can say, ladies,
is that when the day began,

34
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,878
I scarcely imagined
that I'd find myself

35
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,797
tied for the lead with
the immortal Harry Vardon,

36
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,384
and two strokes ahead of
the ever-so-capable Ted Ray.

37
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,596
Ah. Speak of the devil,
and up he pops.

38
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,390
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll be with you presently.

39
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,606
I simply adore Americans.

40
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,777
The exuberance,
such charming naivetÃ©.

41
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,196
How do you find them, Ted?

42
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,073
I should imagine
you feel right at home.

43
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,911
They clasp all manner of the huddled,
yearning masses to their bosoms.

44
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,789
Even the lowly golf professional.

45
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,999
You know, I can foresee a day,

46
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,002
given their democratic standards,

47
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:33,089
when they invite your kind
into their clubhouses.

48
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,299
Well,
how could they resist?

49
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,511
Two poor lads from Jersey,
up from nothing.

50
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,472
Working-class heroes
to the great unwashed.

51
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,682
When all Jersey's ever given us

52
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,893
are potatoes and dairy cows...

53
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,398
Don't look over there.

54
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,610
Sorry, Harry.
I couldn't contain myself.

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,278
Neither could he.

56
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,198
He shouldn't have
brought Jersey into it.

57
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,707
My God. My nose.

58
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,005
Do I look all right?

59
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,676
Quite frankly, Mr. Reid,
it's an improvement.

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,975
So, did you really
see the President?

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,393
He waved at me.

62
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,394
No.

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,605
Yes, he did. President Taft.
- Can you believe Francis?

64
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,691
Why don't I sleep
downstairs tonight?

65
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,401
No. You sleep upstairs.

66
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,487
You'll need your sleep for tomorrow.
- I'm OK.

67
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,197
Oh! Arthur.

68
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,289
So, they call you Mr. Ouimet.

69
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,792
The others,
it just says their names.

70
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,880
Well, Father,
they're professionals.

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,798
I'm an amateur.

72
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,175
Let's have some dessert.

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,385
No, wait, wait. Sit, sit.

74
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,972
They're all talking
about you now.

75
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,896
It say here that if you win,
you get no money.

76
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,191
The others make money,
you get nothing.

77
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,776
What does that prove?

78
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,696
What does that prove?

79
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,785
They don't even pay you!
What kind of work is that?

80
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,203
Arthur.
- What?

81
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,288
I'll fix you a plate.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,878
Come on, you! Pull!

83
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,272
Morning, Harry.

84
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,483
Dreadful English weather.

85
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,989
How'd you sleep?
- Like a baby.

86
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,075
Woke up every two hours and cried.

87
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,592
Hey, Francis!

88
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,595
I had a dream last night
that you shot a 72!

89
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,097
Yeah? It won't be easy
in a nor'easter.

90
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:13,100
You've played this course
in weather like this.

91
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,977
You're right.
It's a good day for a 72.

92
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,396
Okeydokey,
pipe and smokey.

93
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,680
If the Brits beat us, they'll say
it was a fluke I ever won it.

94
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,683
They'll say it's their game,
and we're not good enough.

95
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,477
This is our Open.

96
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,585
Yes. Marvelous.

97
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,473
Ouimet. Ouimet.
O- U-I-M-E-T.

98
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,893
He's only one stroke behind Vardon
and Ray after three rounds.

99
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,772
Move it!
Put your backs into it now!

100
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,069
Go a little deeper there!
There we go.

101
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,785
Not here. Over there.

102
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,996
Watch that end go through!

103
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,707
And move on down!
- Yes, sir!

104
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,576
Thank you.

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,794
Ray needs that putt
for the lead.

106
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,379
I don't want to hear how
anyone else is doing.

107
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,299
We play our own game.

108
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,177
Where do we stand?

109
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:02,181
You'd still have to par the last
five holes to tie Ted for the lead.

110
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,974
Dreadful conditions, Harry.

111
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,893
No one would blame you
if you came...

112
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,103
Thank you, Bernard.

113
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,508
He's done for in there.

114
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,302
No chance he catches him now.

115
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,505
Whoa!

116
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,598
What's got into you, old thing?

117
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,809
You had to go
and get me angry.

118
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,769
Oh, yes. My mistake.

119
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,771
When I par this one,

120
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,773
we'll have to go at it
again tomorrow.

121
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,775
A playoff? What a bother.

122
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,278
Yes, but there it is.

123
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,572
Never seen you smoke
on the job before.

124
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,782
Should've started
four holes earlier.

125
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,004
Ah, all square again.

126
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,673
Not a chance
this stripling bears up.

127
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,510
Probably not.

128
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:36,997
Let 'em look.

129
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,500
We're tied, and you're
the one still playing.

130
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,102
Might as well get out of this
beastly New England weather

131
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,187
and raise a glass
to British victory.

132
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:03,107
What's that carrying
his bag, a Pygmy?

133
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,871
We need two strokes.
One here, one at the 16th...

134
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:20,291
Francis, don't think so much.
You can't play 'em all at once.

135
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,876
You gotta take 'em
one at a time.

136
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,879
One at a time, two down.
Two down, six to play.

137
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,006
I can get one here
and another on 16.

138
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,300
That girl wanted me
to give you this.

139
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,802
What girl?
- Sarah.

140
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,471
Sarah gave you this?

141
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,390
Just put it on.
Don't get all sloppy over it.

142
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,985
To England.

143
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:52,072
What the hell was that?

144
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:54,200
It's not over yet.

145
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,686
Well, well.
Look who's back.

146
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,384
Nice.
- Nice shot!

147
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,972
Let us through.
It's Ouimet's mother.

148
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,273
What's happenin'?

149
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,401
He hit it stone dead at 16.

150
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,486
He's only down one.

151
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,282
What does that mean?
Is it good?

152
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,701
If he makes this, it's a playoff.

153
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:21,871
Dear me, it's almost beyond
one's ability to calculate.

154
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,082
Ah, don't mind if I do.

155
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,884
He can't keep this up.
It's impossible.

156
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,370
I'll be damned.

157
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,375
Yeah!

158
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,710
Oh, Francis!

159
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,693
There will be
an 18-hole playoff tomorrow

160
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:18,988
between Vardon, Ray
and Mr. Ouimet

161
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,198
to decide the Championship.

162
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,379
That boy's a gift
from the gods.

163
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,882
They're printing 'round
the clock at home.

164
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,301
Cripes! Imagine what
they're selling here.

165
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,471
Should have bought one of these
rags when I had the chance.

166
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,893
It's a bold charge,
but he's spent his powder.

167
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,687
It's a two-man game now,
my lads.

168
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:54,398
An all-English final.

169
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,984
Well, we'll see.

170
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,570
Come on, Harry.
It's inconceivable.

171
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,991
The man's a bloody amateur.

172
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:06,285
When was the last time
you were beaten...

173
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,496
Have you ever been
beaten, man-to-man,

174
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,873
in your entire career
by an amateur?

175
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,084
Amateurs do not win Opens.

176
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,586
Hell, the last one
who won it back home

177
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,671
was 40 years ago,
and he was a gentleman.

178
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:21,300
This one's nothing of the kind.
He's a peasant. Common clay.

179
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,677
He'll fold like an accordion.

180
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,971
I need my rest.

181
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,480
If he couldn't hit the ball
a country mile, he'd be digging ditches.

182
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,779
Where are you going, Harry?
Sit down with me.

183
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,698
Eat with me.
Enjoy yourself.

184
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,784
I came here to win a trophy.

185
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,495
On the face of it, Ted Ray
or I should carry it off.

186
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,372
Not for you, not for England,

187
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:54,583
but for bloody pride at being
the best. That's why we do this.

188
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:58,379
And if Mr. Ouimet wins tomorrow,
it's because he's the best,

189
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,673
because of who he is.

190
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,509
Not who his father was,
not how much money he's got,

191
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:05,594
because of who he bloody is!

192
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,098
And I'll thank you
to remember that.

193
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:15,604
And I'll thank you to show the respect
a gentleman gives as a matter of course.

194
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,482
Good night.

195
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,801
Do you want him to fail?

196
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:51,474
Is that the only satisfaction
you can take from what he's doin'?

197
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:56,979
You think I want him
to break his heart?

198
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:02,610
What will you do,
Mary, when he fails?

199
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:04,695
How will you help him then?

200
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,907
All you ever do
is encourage him.

201
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:14,371
That's right.
I do encourage him.

202
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:17,500
He has a God-given talent,

203
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,086
and this is his one chance
to give a voice to it.

204
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,383
He's just tryin'
to make you proud.

205
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:58,082
"It seems impossible to believe
that this untested boy

206
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,210
could hope to beat
two seasoned champions. "

207
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:09,009
One David against two Goliaths.

208
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,807
He'll have to face
Vardon and Ray alone,

209
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,601
with a night to sleep
on the incredible situation

210
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,771
in which he so shockingly
finds himself.

211
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,984
Although, I suspect,

212
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,695
from the unearthly calm
he showed today,

213
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,780
he will sleep
better than most.

214
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,370
I am not certain I believe
Ouimet can win,

215
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:40,207
but I have given up
all attempts at prophecy.

216
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:44,503
I will start tomorrow's round
with an open mind.

217
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:50,009
It should be
the greatest game ever played.

218
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:28,798
Young man.
We've been talking this over.

219
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,174
Talking what over?

220
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,095
The members feel you need as much
help as you can get out there today.

221
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:36,388
What kind of help?
- According to the rules,

222
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:39,183
your caddie is the only person
who can give you advice.

223
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,770
You need someone with you today
who really knows our course.

224
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,689
Exactly.
- Eddie's doin' a great job for me.

225
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,274
For God's sake, Ouimet!

226
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,776
This is the U.S. Open,

227
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,487
not some junior
club championship.

228
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,697
You told Eddie this
before talking to me?

229
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,908
Oh, you can't reason
with a boy like that.

230
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,203
We'll take up a collection
for him and pay him handsomely.

231
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,497
I understand
his family could use it.

232
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,582
Don't let 'em do it, Francis!

233
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,292
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

234
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,795
Is it true? You know
I can't pay you, Eddie.

235
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:10,881
I wouldn't do it for ten bucks.
I wouldn't do it for a hundred!

236
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:13,175
Hey, listen.
You think I'd replace you?

237
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,177
But they said you'd want to.

238
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,680
Who cares what they said?
Who cares?

239
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:21,392
This is me and you.
We're a team. OK?

240
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,686
They don't get a vote in this.

241
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,271
All right?

242
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,399
I'll meet you outside.

243
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:38,701
Don't ever talk to my caddie again.

244
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,302
Mr. Ouimet will play first.

245
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:01,682
Mr. Darwin will act as honorary
marker and keep your scores.

246
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,481
Gentlemen, it's time.

247
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,282
Here he comes!
- Good luck, son!

248
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,996
Come on, young man!
- Come on, Ouimet!

249
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:26,290
Come on, Francis!
Come on!

250
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,673
Give us a strong show, son.

251
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:43,200
Five for you there?
- That's right.

252
00:29:45,703 --> 00:29:47,371
You can do it, Francis.

253
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,206
What?
- Wha... Sorry.

254
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,375
Did I say something?

255
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,877
That was big.

256
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,394
They're human.

257
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:11,896
What's that?

258
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,773
I can play these guys, Eddie.

259
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:15,691
Yeah? Who said you couldn't?

260
00:30:26,911 --> 00:30:29,580
Oooh!

261
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,292
Maybe they're not human.

262
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,678
This is where he fell
apart the last time.

263
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,273
That was yesterday.

264
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:13,290
Sarah!

265
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:16,293
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in school.

266
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,087
Don't be ridiculous, Father.

267
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,177
He's not cracking, Harry.

268
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,096
The thought
occurred to me.

269
00:31:28,097 --> 00:31:30,099
"An all-English final. "

270
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:41,777
Quiet, please.

271
00:32:15,895 --> 00:32:17,188
Stymied.

272
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,204
What are you doin'?
- I'll show you.

273
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,603
Come on, now. Finish him.

274
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,276
Let's see if he cracks now.

275
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,372
Fore right!

276
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,296
He's dead in those trees.

277
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:41,480
Mid iron.

278
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,378
Done in by the monarch
of the forest.

279
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:31,572
Down to you, old thing.
I'm done.

280
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,699
Pity. It's a great match.

281
00:34:34,492 --> 00:34:36,911
That's the spirit, Harry.

282
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:42,083
Come on, Ouimet.

283
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:29,083
Where you going with that?

284
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,002
Gonna cut the corner.
- There's a bunker down there.

285
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,671
If he's over it,
he's a chip away.

286
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:36,090
We don't know he's over it.
It's a trick.

287
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,200
This is
our chance, Francis.

288
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,285
Run it in there,
just like yesterday.

289
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:44,403
My God. Francis has
a one-stroke lead with one to play.

290
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,173
Hold the line, please.

291
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,592
Hold the line!
Hold the line!

292
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,098
Take your time.

293
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:47,276
Let me have that towel, Eddie.

294
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,789
Well done.

295
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:28,581
You need this for 72.
You can do it.

296
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:31,792
Read it, roll it and hole it.

297
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:11,999
Yeah!

298
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,399
Yeah! Yeah!

299
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:38,984
Yeah!

300
00:47:47,993 --> 00:47:49,787
Yeah!

301
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,789
Thank you! Thank you!

302
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,791
You did it!
- Thank you!

303
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,586
Look, Eddie, we did it!
We did it!

304
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:23,195
No! No! I can't take it!

305
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:25,072
Pass the hat for Eddie!

306
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,700
Pass the hat for Eddie! Here!

307
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,584
Pass the hat for Eddie!
Pass the hat for...

308
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:55,598
Well played, Mr. Ouimet.
That was a great game.

309
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:57,308
I enjoyed it.

310
00:50:58,392 --> 00:50:59,977
So did I.

311
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:01,479
Yes, you did.

312
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:06,108
Congratulations on your success.
You deserve it.

313
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:07,485
Thank you.

314
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:17,703
We'll play again sometime.

315
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:35,971
Look at this thing.

316
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:38,808
It's a whopper.
- Isn't that something?

317
00:51:38,808 --> 00:51:40,476
They let you take it
home with ya?

318
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:42,103
Nobody's tried to stop me.

319
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
Well, they'd have to get past me.

320
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:47,400
You know somethin', Eddie?

321
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:49,402
You and I are gonna be
great friends.

322
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:51,487
You said it, Francis.
