          - I mean it.          

132
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:29,087
How would you feel if I told    
you that I was going to have    

133
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,122
         another baby?          

134
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31,156
How would you feel if I told    
you that I was going to have    

135
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,129
    - Well what about Sean?     

136
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,098
       - What about Sean?       

137
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,049
      - Are we just gonna       
       forget about him?        

138
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,999
       - What about Sean?       

139
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,702
        - No honey, no,         
  of course not, but look....   

140
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,403
       - What about Sean?       

141
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,122
    (continues, indistinct)     

142
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,840
       - What about Sean?       

143
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,786
             Jake!              

144
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,927
           (humming)            

145
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,298
   (accordion plays on radio)   

146
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,349
      (humming continues)       

147
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,399
   (accordion plays on radio)   

148
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,919
      (man snorts, grunts)      

149
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,437
   (accordion plays on radio)   

150
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,463
              Ah.               

151
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,769
       (knocking on door)       

152
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,205
      - God damn it, Byron.     

153
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,777
     Sweetie, what's wrong?     

154
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,013
            (crying)            

155
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,285
          Come on in.           

156
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,994

157
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,864
         - Pretty good.         
        - "Pretty good"?        

158
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,516
     - Well, my mom's is better.

159
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,167
         - Pretty good.         
        - "Pretty good"?        

160
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,138
- It oughta be, she learned     
from the best: your grandmother.

161
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,340
  Here's mud in your eye.       

162
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,541
- It oughta be, she learned     
from the best: your grandmother.

163
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:34,145
         (polka music)          

164
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,539
         There you go.          

165
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,080
         - I miss Sean.         

166
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,885
       - Yeah, we all do.       

167
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,221
      It's not easy losing      
       somebody you love.       

168
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,556
       - Yeah, we all do.       

169
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,028
       I lost my wife and       
       I lost my grandson       

170
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,697
and I lost buddies in the war.  

171
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,365
       I lost my wife and       
       I lost my grandson       

172
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,869
    It don't get any easier.    

173
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,504
I wish I could tell ya          
there's some kind of magical    

174
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,039
answer, but there isn't any.    

175
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,573
I wish I could tell ya          
there's some kind of magical    

176
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,014
You wouldn't believe me anyhow. 
You're to smart for that.       

177
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,624
      You know something?       
    You and me are the same.    

178
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,463
     We're the strong ones.     

179
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,400
       We carry the load.       

180
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:08,306
      And when you carry a      
      load for a long time      

181
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,641
       you get stronger.        

182
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,975
      And when you carry a      
      load for a long time      

183
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,948
Now, your mom is bringing a     
brand new life into the world   

184
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,067
and she needs your help         
and she needs your support.     

185
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:21,185
Now, your mom is bringing a     
brand new life into the world   

186
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,622
     You can do that, right?    

187
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,599
       Goodnight, sweetie.      

188

190
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,392
       - I'll pick you up       
       after school, okay?      

191
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,894
      - I'm old enough to       
     walk home alone now--      

192
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,395
       - I'll pick you up       
       after school, okay?      

193
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,747
- Just wait for me, alright?    

194
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,098
       - I'll pick you up       
       after school, okay?      

195
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:44,702
      Hey. Have a good day.

198
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,517
        (clock ticking)         

199
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,363
      - [Hawthorne] Jake.       

200
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,264
     - Yes, Miss Hawthorne?

      - [Hawthorne] Jake.       

202
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,183
        - [Hawthorne] I         
       asked a question.        

203
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,200
      - [Hawthorne] Jake.       

204
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,268
- The flood happened in 1927.   

205
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,335
      - [Hawthorne] Jake.       

206

correct. Pay closer attention   

207

      - [Hawthorne] Jake.       

208

    For somethin' to happen.    

238
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:46,317
     - I'm not supposed to      
    talk to strangers so...

00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,535
     - [Tall Hat] Sensible.     

240
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:48,752
     - I'm not supposed to      
    talk to strangers so...

00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,190
          That's Dee.

           I'm Wyeth.           

244
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,266
Now that we know each other,    
we're no longer strangers.      

245
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,801
           I'm Wyeth.

247
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,737
           I'm Wyeth.

251
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:10,942
           I'm Wyeth.           

252
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:11,743
     - What were you doing      
        when you got it?        

253
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:12,543
           I'm Wyeth.           

254
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,095
     - [John] Maybe she was     
    running, maybe she fell.    

255
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,646
           I'm Wyeth.           

256
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,014
- Why were you running, Jake?   

257
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,381
           I'm Wyeth.

262
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:25,656

263
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,141
    - [John] I bet you miss     
    your brother, don't you?    

264
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,625
             - Why?             

265
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,811
     - Of course she does.      

266
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:30,995
             - Why?             

267
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,298
You like magic, right, Jake?    

268
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,032
        (ominous music)         

269
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:35,765
You like magic, right, Jake?    

270
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:36,367
         - [Jake] Sure.         

271
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:36,967
You like magic, right, Jake?    

272
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,470
       - Well, what sorta       
    trick do you wanna see?     

273
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,971
You like magic, right, Jake?    

274
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,456
- She wants her brother back.   

275
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,940
You like magic, right, Jake?    

276
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,677
      - That's impossible.      
     - You sure about that?     

277
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:47,829
       - Slow down, John.       

278
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,980
      - That's impossible.      
     - You sure about that?     

279
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,251
You seem pretty sure about that.

280
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,589
          Is it empty?          

281
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:04,996
            - Yeah.             

282
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:05,847
        - Give it here.         

283
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:06,697
            - Yeah.             

284
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,803
        Watch carefully.        

285
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,009
- How was school today, Jake?   

286
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:18,943
      - Fine, it was fine.      

287
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,876
- How was school today, Jake?   

288
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:20,344
    - Did your daddy forget     

289
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:20,810
- How was school today, Jake?   

290
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:21,679
      to come and get you?      
             - No--             

291
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,546
- How was school today, Jake?   

292
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,482
       - Make sure you're       
       watching closely.        

293
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,417
- How was school today, Jake?   

294
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,535
        (ominous music)         

295
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,652
- How was school today, Jake?   

296
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,933
          (solid thud)          
           (rattling)           

297
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,338
          Stomp on it.          

298
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,873
           (rattling)           

299
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,407
          Stomp on it.          

300
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,679
          Stomp on it!          

301
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,687
            Open it.            

302
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,662
            (gasps)             
            (thuds)             

303
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:12,697
           (laughing)           

304
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,731
            (gasps)             
            (thuds)             

305
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,900
    Your brother's not dead,    
    he's just hard to find.     

306
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,068
            (gasps)             
            (thuds)             

307
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,073
            Come on.            

308
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,914
We got a lot to talk about.     

309
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,232
        (ominous music)         

310
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,549
We got a lot to talk about.     

311
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,991
          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

312
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,693
         [Mom arguing]          

313
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,394
          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

314
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,930
        [Dad] I told her        
        to wait for me!         

315
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,464
          [Jake's Dad]          
       I was what, maybe        
       five minutes late.       

316
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,456
        (fire crackling)        

317
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,860
       Come closer, child.      

318
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:23,100
There's no reason you can't     
have your brother back, Jake.   

319
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,604
     - I don't understand.      

320
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,538
            (thud)              

321
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,471
     - I don't understand.      

322
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,541
- Go on, don't be afraid.       

323
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,609
     - I don't understand.      

324
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,791
           (laughing)           

325
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,163
           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

326
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,081
        The rules of the        
     game are not as fixed      

327
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:53,998
           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

328
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,433
as you think they are, Jake.    

329
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,867
           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

330
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,803
       But nothin' comes        
       for nothin', right?      

331
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,738
           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

332
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,256
     We all want somethin'.     

333
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,773
           (rattling)           
        (ominous music)         

334
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,777
       We can bring your        
      brother back to life,     

335
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,312
        but somebody has        
       to take his place.       

336
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,846
       We can bring your        
      brother back to life,     

337
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,818
          - Like who?           

338
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,203
- What about your little        
boyfriend Willie Proctor?       

339
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,587
          - Like who?           

340
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,039
    - He's not my boyfriend.    
           - Exactly.           

341
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,490
          - Like who?           

342
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,576
       If he were to take       
      your brother's place      

343
00:24:21,577 --> 00:24:23,661
          - Like who?           

344
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:24,846
you could have Sean back.       

345
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,030
          - Like who?           

346
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:27,982
       - Well what do you       
     guys want with Willie?     

347
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:29,933
          - Like who?           

348
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,203
     - Nobody'll miss him.      

349
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,438
      Everybody at school       
       makes fun of him,        

350
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,672
     - Nobody'll miss him.      

351
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,140
     he's fucked up, right?     

352
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,607
     - Nobody'll miss him.      

353
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,811
- So what's the big deal?       

354
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,863
You make Willie disappear and   
your family's happy again.      

355
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,914
- So what's the big deal?       

356
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,251
       - Yeah, maybe your       
     mama won't be so sad.      

357
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,586
- So what's the big deal?       

358
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,590
       - What do you say?       

359
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,926
      Now you bring Willie      
     Proctor to the quarry.     

360
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,763
When he goes off the ledge      
you'll get your brother back.   

361
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,599
      Now you bring Willie      
     Proctor to the quarry.     

362
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,105
     Should we shake on it?     

363
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,942
        (ominous music)         

364
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,239
         - We got her.          

365
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,524
- [Byron] Copy that, Sheriff.   

366
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:44,808
         - We got her.          

367
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,861
         - [Isabel] Oh!         
       Oh, we missed you.       

368
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,913
         - We got her.          

369
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:49,514
        - [Dad] Honey we        
       love you so much.        

370
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,114
         - We got her.          

371
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:50,948
       - [Isabel] You're        
       sure you're okay?        

372
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,781
         - We got her.          

373
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:52,750
   - [Dad] Hey I told you to    
          wait for me.          

374
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:53,717
         - We got her.          

375
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,436
    - Just leave her alone.     
          - Hey, hey.           

376
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,154
         - We got her.          

377
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:57,922
             Easy.              

378
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,689
         - We got her.          

379
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,491
 Jake, why don't you come over  
here and tell me what happened. 

380
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,292
         - We got her.          

381
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:10,768
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

382
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,053
        and then I just         
      decided to walk home,     

383
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:13,337
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

384
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,739
     and when I was walking     
       through the woods        

385
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,140
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

386
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:18,359
       I saw this man in        
     the old train tunnel.      

387
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,577
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

388
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,262
         - [Dad] What?          

389
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:21,945
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

390
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,264
       - Go ahead, go on.       

391
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:24,581
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up   

392
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,616
- There were like three men,    

393
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,649
- Okay, so I was waiting for    
Dad for a while to pick me up

           (knocking)           

525
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21,512
     Sheriff's department.      

526
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,579
           (knocking)           

527
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,480
        We're comin' in.        

528
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,380
           (knocking)           

529
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,883

         Step forward.          

533
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,977
           Big John.            

534
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,514
             Well?              

535
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,248
            Nothing?            

536
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:31,981
             Well?              

537
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:32,833
             - No.              

538
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:33,683
             Well?              

539
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,454
- Not even the little           
squirrely guy on the right?     

540
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,890
        - No, I've never        
      seen him in my life.      

541
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,325
- Not even the little           
squirrely guy on the right?     

542
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:47,731
- Okay, you done good, kiddo.   

543
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,402
             Byron.             

544
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,571
Go ahead take Jake home and     
ah meet me back at the station. 

545
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,739
             Byron.             

546
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,474
     - Sure thing Sheriff.      

547
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,207
             Byron.             

548
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,910
     - Thank you very much,     
           gentlemen,           

549
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,611
             Byron.             

550
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,929
     stay put for a minute.     

551
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,246
             Byron.             

552
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:31,108
       (melancholy music)       

553
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:01,438
      (indistinct voices)       

554
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:07,344
        (woman moaning)         
             Big D!             

555
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,367
- That place gave me the creeps.
             - Why?             

556
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,270
- Well I don't know. Felt like  
it was haunted or somethin'.    

557
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,172
- That place gave me the creeps.
             - Why?             

558
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,841
- Who used to live there?       

559
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,276
     - Oh, I never met 'em,     
      I just heard a rumor      

560
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,710
- Who used to live there?       

561
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,730
that they were gypsies and      
one day they disappeared.       

562
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:46,749
- Who used to live there?       

563
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,202
            (yells)             
           (screams)            

564
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,653
- Who used to live there?       

565
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,604
             Sorry.             

566
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:51,554
- Who used to live there?       

567
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,327
       (thunder crackles)       

568
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:20,350
         (gentle music)         

569
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,965
        (man gibbering)         

570
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,760
        (deep growling)         

571
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:19,536
        (woman moaning)         

572
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,241
           (rattling)           

573
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,646
        - What's wrong?         

574
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,581
      - You were screaming      
         in your sleep.         

575
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,515
        - What's wrong?         

576
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,720
- It was just a bad dream.      

577
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,956
       Go on back to bed.       

578
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:43,627
           Go on, git!          

579
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,716
       (distant gunshots)       

580
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,596
           (clicking)           

581
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,368
          (gun fires)           

582
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:29,439
           (laughing)           

583
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,895
         - Sweetheart.          

584
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,904
       Do you know, um...       

585
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:01,872
            - What?             

586
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:02,839
       Do you know, um...       

587
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,742
- I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

588
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,394
     straight up. Willie's      
     granddaddy called me,      

589
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:09,045
- I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

590
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,081
and he doesn't want you         
going anywhere near Willie,     

591
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,116
- I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

592
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:14,968
       so just stay away.       

593
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:16,819
- I don't know how to put it    
other than just telling you     

594
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,090
        I hate like hell        
        to tell ya that.        

595
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:24,994
I know you're fond of him.      

596
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,600
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

597
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,353
but you know, everything's      
gonna be alright, I promise you.

598
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:36,105
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

599
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,324
  You just hang in there and--  

600
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,541
And I know that your

601
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,843
            (laughs)            
     "Just hang in there."      

602
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,144
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

603
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,412
      Sound like a goddamn      
    football coach (laughs).    

604
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,679
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

605
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:44,748
      I wish your grandma       
      was here to hear me,      

606
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:45,815
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

607
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,650
    you know what she'd say,    
    she'd say, "Waterhouse,     

608
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:47,484
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,    

609
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,553
  you're so full of shit it's   
  comin' outta your mouth."     

610
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,621
And I know that your            
brother's death left a mark,

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,515
     - [Bully] You're mine!

So what are you gonna get?      

628
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,199

      eat more than that.       

629
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,551
So what are you gonna get?      

630
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,653
          - Yeah okay.          

631
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:57,871
- We can split something.       

632
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,088
          - Yeah okay.

        (ominous music)         

635
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,677
    - I have a job for you.     

636
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,914
I need you to get something     
that was taken from me.

00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,863
         Give it here.          

648
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,174
       Does he trust you?       

649
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:42,278
You know what you need to do.   

650
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,113
- I'm gonna see Willie          
just like we talked about.      

651
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,947
You know what you need to do.

788
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,812
        She'll be back.         

789
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,820
           (hissing)            

790
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,457
        (ominous music)         

791
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,747
           (vomiting)           

792
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,450
         (vomiting)             

793
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:22,518
        - Looks like you        
       could use a hand.        

794
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,392
Didn't mean to scare you.       

795
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,842
          (whimpering)          

796
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,620
       - [Byron] Sheriff.       

797
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,392
            Sheriff.            

798
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,129
            - What?             

799
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,998
- [Byron] Uh, it's Isabel.      

800
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,866
            - What?             

801
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:14,603
      - What'd you think?       

802
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,339
- We can save your daughter,    
we can't save the baby.         

803
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,074
      - What'd you think?       

804
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,654
            (crying)            

805
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:42,097
- Sorry to hear about your mom. 

806
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:47,035
Anything we can do to help?     

807
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,905
          - Like what?          

808
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:00,449
- Our offer still stands, child.

809
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,525
You know where to find us.      

810
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,695
        (chain jingles)         

811
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:23,539
            (crying)            

812
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:36,452
         - (muttering)          

813
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:37,787
      (projector whirring)      

814
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,121
         - (muttering)          

815
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,657
Your grandma sent this to me    
when I was overseas in the war. 

816
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,192
         - (muttering)          

817
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:45,611
I've been wanting you to see it.

818
00:57:45,612 --> 00:57:47,028
         - (muttering)          

819
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:48,531
      Seemed like tonight       
       was a good night.        

820
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:50,032
         - (muttering)          

821
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:52,551
See ah, every Sunday they       
used to show a Hollywood        

822
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,069
         - (muttering)          

823
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,072
picture and I didn't have       
any way to see what your grandma

824
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,073
         - (muttering)          

825
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,293
      sent me, so I traded      
       the projectionist        

826
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:03,511
         - (muttering)          

827
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,180
     a bottle of whiskey,       

828
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:04,847
         - (muttering)          

829
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:06,382
he showed it before the feature.

830
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:07,916
         - (muttering)          

831
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:09,268
         (gentle music)         

832
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:10,619
         - (muttering)          

833
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,992
     The men went bananas.      

834
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,511
He showed it four times before  
they'd let the feature start.   

835
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:22,029
     The men went bananas.      

836
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,936
It reminded them of their own.  

837
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:33,575
Their own families,             
their own wives and kids.       

838
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:45,287
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

839
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,189
he tracked me down and he       
said hey I need that film back  

840
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,090
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

841
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,125
and I said what do you mean     
you want that film back         

842
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,158
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

843
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,428
    and he said well the men    
    have demanded to see it,    

844
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,696
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

845
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,198
    they demanded to see it.    

846
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:56,698
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

847
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,917
They want to see it next Sunday 
and the Sunday after that.      

848
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:01,135
       Next day the fella       
     that booked the movies     

849
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,042
            Yes sir.            

850
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:10,012
      You know your mother      
        and your grandma        

851
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:11,797
they were bigger stars over     
there than Rita Hayworth        

852
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,581
      You know your mother      
        and your grandma        

853
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:14,733
      and Ingrid Bergman.       

854
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:15,883
      You know your mother      
        and your grandma        

855
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,587
They'd like to wear it out      
they played it so many times.   

856
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:21,073
     I had to steal it back     
    the last time (laughs).     

857
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,558
They'd like to wear it out      
they played it so many times.   

858
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:57,726
         What is this?          

859
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,729
What are you doing with this?   

860
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,014
        (ominous music)         

861
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,298
What are you doing with this?   

862
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:16,178
       (sirens whirring)        

863
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,893
           (gunshots)           
            - Wyeth!            

864
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:33,895
             John!              

865
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:34,446
              Dee!              

866
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:34,996
             John!              

867
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:36,499
- [Wyeth] Evenin' Sheriff.      

868
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,000
             John!              

869
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:48,777
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

870
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:49,595
See, I love that little girl    
and I will not have you         

871
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:50,412
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

872
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:52,114
loathsome degenerates filling   
up her mind with all these      

873
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,815
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

874
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,384
      fucking fairy tales       
     about her dead brother,    

875
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,952
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

876
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:57,503
        do you hear me?         

877
01:00:57,504 --> 01:00:58,053
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

878
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,189
       - I've never lied        
      to Jake in my life.       

879
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,324
    - What business you got     
     with my granddaughter?     

880
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,968
- What the hell is going on?    

881
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,407
    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

882
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,059
     - I don't see no badge,    
    Sheriff, and I don't see    

883
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,710
    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

884
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,429
       no warrant, and yet      
        here I see you.         

885
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,147
    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

886
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:27,132
       - These men aren't       
     who they say they are.     

887
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,116
    - I am giving these men     
     their walking papers.      

888
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,987
Their intentions are ungodly.   

889
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:32,721
           (cock rifles)        

890
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:33,454
Their intentions are ungodly.   

891
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,024
     These are marked men.      

892
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,543
- What makes you think I        
give a shit about anything      

893
01:01:37,544 --> 01:01:39,061
     These are marked men.      

894
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,596
that comes outta your mouth?    

895
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:42,130
     These are marked men.      

896
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:52,040
- Then shoot go ahead and shoot.

897
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:21,203
           (laughing)           

898
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:22,554
           (yelling)            

899
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:23,904
           (laughing)           

900
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:29,244
       (foreign language)       

901
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:33,081
     - I brought some food,     

902
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,133
     I thought you and your     
     boys might be hungry.      

903
01:02:35,134 --> 01:02:37,184
     - I brought some food,     

904
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:47,763
     I need to talk to you.     

905
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:49,048
       (foreign language)       

906
01:02:49,049 --> 01:02:50,332
     I need to talk to you.     

907
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:02,377
       (foreign language)       

908
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,325
          (gunshots)            

909
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,199
       (foreign language)       

910
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,584
        (ominous music)         

911
01:03:25,585 --> 01:03:26,968
       (foreign language)       

912
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:14,149
     - Just let her sleep.      

913
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,957
I'll be back in a few hours.    

914
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,434
        - I missed you.         

915
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:45,580
     - I know how to bring      
    my brother back to life.    

916
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:46,481
           - Really?            

917
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:47,381
     - I know how to bring      
    my brother back to life.    

918
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,220
      - Will you help me?       

919
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:52,938
            - Yeah.             

920
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:53,655
      - Will you help me?       

921
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:59,027
          - Let's go.           
        - You mean now?         

922
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,578

      - What about school?      

925
01:05:01,247 --> 01:05:02,363

926
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:06,434

       too scared, then...      

927
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:22,951

930
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,190
             Byron.             
    Byron, wake the fuck up.

964
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,877
     - [Wyeth] Nah, not yet.    

965
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,082
  - You hurt my granddaughter,  
  I swear...                    

966
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:36,935
- I wouldn't hurt a single      
hair on her pretty head.        

967
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,787
  - You hurt my granddaughter,  
  I swear...                    

968
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:46,694
     I don't wanna kill you,    

969
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,763
I want you both to suffer. Huh? 

970
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,831
     I don't wanna kill you,    

971
01:12:54,637 --> 01:12:58,139
Your granddaughter's about      
to throw Willie Proctor         

972
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:59,073
        into the quarry.

     her. she won't do that.    

975
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:10,451
        - She's about to        
        do it right now.        

976
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:16,858
    If it's any consolation,    

977
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,460
      she'll probably get       
       away with murder.        

978
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:20,061
    If it's any consolation,    

979
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,846
     But she'll be haunted      
      the rest of her life      

980
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:23,630
    If it's any consolation,    

981
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:24,666
        by what she did.        

982
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:25,700

        (lighter clicks)        

987
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,814
You're forgetting one thing.    

988
01:14:12,816 --> 01:14:13,748
         - What's that?         

989
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:14,681
You're forgetting one thing.    

990
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:21,656
- All they said is that         
somebody has to take his place. 

991
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,892
    - You're forgetting what    
    the old Chinaman said.      

992
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,127
- All they said is that         
somebody has to take his place. 

993
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,012
        When you go on a        
       journey of revenge...    

994
01:14:28,013 --> 01:14:29,896
- All they said is that         
somebody has to take his place. 

995
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:34,068

        there's only the        
      living and the dead.

       right or wrong...        

1028

goes by that I don't regret

what happened to that woman     
and that I could've stopped it.

things, but only one is worth
