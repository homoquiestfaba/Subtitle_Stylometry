Is that understood?

1255
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:05,815
As to the sworn testimony
of Lady Marguerite,

1256
01:20:05,882 --> 01:20:10,185
one can only come to the
conclusion she must have dreamt it.

1257
01:20:10,252 --> 01:20:13,222
Now, have these findings
sent immediately to Paris

1258
01:20:13,289 --> 01:20:17,126
before this insouciant knight troubles
our king any further with this nonsense.

1259
01:20:18,828 --> 01:20:20,262
Yes, speak.

1260
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:22,531
Milord, I have
been informed

1261
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:25,735
that Jean de Carrouges has
already travelled to Paris.

1262
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:29,471
He is filing an appeal to His
Majesty at this very moment.

1263
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:39,783
Cunt.

1264

1265
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,853
There really is
no decision to make.

1266
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,822
You're a cleric
in minor orders.

1267
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:48,858
So, you can escape the
jurisdiction of the secular courts

1268
01:20:48,925 --> 01:20:50,659
and be tried
by the Church

1269
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:53,295
where conditions are
more favorable.

1270

among those accused of rape.

1272

They escape serious punishment by
claiming benefit of clergy, so...

1273

case and be done with the matter.

1278

Absolutely not.

1279
01:21:20,857 --> 01:21:24,693
It's strange she would claim
rape and risk her life.

1280
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:28,464
(SIGHS)
Why would she do this?

1281
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:32,635
All of France is talking about
this, and I'm innocent.

1282
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,671
I've said publicly
that this never happened!

1283

And yet,
under extraordinary pressure

1284

and at great risk
to her name and reputation,

1285
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,780
Lady Marguerite has
said that it did.

1286
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:49,719
Formally, this is
not about her.

1287
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:52,822
Rape is not a crime
against a woman.

1288
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:56,325
It is a property crime
against her male guardian.

1289

In this case,
Jean de Carrouges.

1290
01:21:58,394 --> 01:22:02,932
This is not a matter over which a
duel should be fought to the death.

1291
01:22:04,768 --> 01:22:07,302
It should be
settled quietly.

1298
01:22:39,435 --> 01:22:41,570
and I do hereby deny

1299
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:43,338
all the aforesaid charges,

1300
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:44,774

Carrouges,

And I further maintain,
saving the honor of Your Majesty,

1309
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:09,631
that the said knight

1310
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,600
has falsely

1311
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,002

1312

1313
01:23:16,672 --> 01:23:19,241

to say this thing.

1314
01:23:21,778 --> 01:23:23,747

1315
01:23:26,482 --> 01:23:28,417

1316
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:31,121

necessary to prove my innocence.

have spoken well.

a sign of his guilt.

Do you know
the name of this cheese?

1767

I think that
it is Roquefort.

01:51:52,121 --> 01:51:55,958
No. No, no, not Roquefort.
It's not as strong as Roquefort.
