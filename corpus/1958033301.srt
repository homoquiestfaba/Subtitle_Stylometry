looked, the snow was gone.

00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,846
<i>You couldn't bring in
snow from outside the park.</i>

327
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,642
<i>I had to use whatever
was in the town.</i>

over to Sage and her team,</i>

00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:06,220
<i>to meet Craig, to meet
Bella, all of our different actors,</i>

662
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,473
<i>there was something of where
I knew this was going to be</i>

663
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:14,561
the hardest and the
best experience of my life.

664
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,146
<i>And weirdly, there was something</i>

665
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,816
<i>that I knew was
special and terrifying.</i>

666
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,111
And it all came true. (LAUGHS)

667
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:28,367
On the first day, I set
a fairly reasonable goal

668
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,827
to make the best
television show ever.

669
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,413
That was our reasonable goal.

670
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:37,502
I just want to say thank you.
I love you guys. Thank you.

671
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,296
(CHEERING, CLAPPING)

672
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:45,134
♪ ("THE LAST OF US" MAIN THEME
CONTINUES) ♪

673
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,490
And that's the end
of this story.
