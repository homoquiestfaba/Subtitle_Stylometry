I can hitch a ride

295
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,243
No Verizon on the
horizon here, darlin'.

296
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,829
Your best bet's gonna
be a gas station

298
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,708

50 miles that way.

is bad. This is so bad.

00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,741
- Oh!
- It ain't that bad,

313
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,409
but it ain't good either.

to be optimistic, okay?

How is she lookin'?

320
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,715
If we cut deals for
everyone you like, Mom,

321
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,799
we'd run out of business.

322
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,387
I mean, I can fix it...

323
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,680
but a vintage ride like this,

324
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,473
it's gonna take a
minute to get the parts.

325
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,808
How long of a minute?

326
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,851
Um, two weeks.

327
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,287
- Two weeks? No. No.
- That's what I said.

328
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,063
And that's if they
get here on time.

329
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,400
Well, I mean, that puts
us just before Christmas,

330
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,360
so I can think of no better gift

331
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,320
than to have this
beauty running like new.

332
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,781
I have to report
to LA by the 24th.

333
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,116
- LA?
- Yeah.

334
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,919
On Christmas Eve? What's
so important in LA?

335

he get more optimistic?

338
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,417
He's gonna try his
hardest. Aren't you, Jer?

339
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,752
How much is this gonna cost?

340
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,296
Well, with the bumper, the axle,

341
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,216

It's my everything.

Yeah, as long as you have
a pair of scissors handy...

352

tells you to cut it up.

527
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,279
so a man's gotta
wear a lot of hats.

528
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,555
Hmm. Oh, you mean jackets?

529
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,432
[chuckles]

530
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,893
- Look, I got a plan.
- Well, here's my plan.

531
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,644
Uh, you know what, you go first.

532
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,147
- Tell me your plan.
- I get a job while you fix the bus.

533
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,608
When you're done, I'll have
two grand and be on my way.

534
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,777
So, what do you got in
a town like this? Diner?

535
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,861
Post office?

536
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,446
Phone operators?

537
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,824
You know that minimum wage
around here is $7.25 an hour?

538
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:44,412
That's gonna be probably around
300 hours over the next two weeks.

539
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,749
Okay. [smacks lips] So,
what's your awesome plan then?

540
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,548
[Gail] Very festive.

541
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,844
A middle school?

542
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,597
What, am I dealing pot?

543
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,891
What kind of middle
school did you go to?

544
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,939
It smells like sneakers
and fruit snacks.

545
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,150
You better start talking. Oh!

546
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,444
[panting] Jeremy,
where have you been?

547
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,279
The twins, they're recruiting

548
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,281
for their new rap
song music video.

549
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,741
Sarah, slow down.

550
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,636
And since when are there
oboe players in a rap song?

551
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,679
-[frantically] And then... And then they were...
-Hey.

552
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,348
-Why were they... No, but they were...
-Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

553
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,125
Look at me. Look at me.
My eyes. My eyes, okay?

554
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,876
- [breathing heavily]
- Okay? Good.

555
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,088
Do as I do. Follow me.

556
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,798
[both inhales deeply]

557
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,633
[both exhales deeply]

558
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,102
Better?

559
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,647
Oh!

560
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,274
Are you the new music teacher?

561
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,525
- No.
- Yeah.

562
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,986
What?

563
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,405
[unsynchronized music playing]

564
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,586
[blows whistle]

565
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,504
[music stops]

566
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,966
I'd like you to meet our
new music teacher, Miss...

567
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,343
[chuckles] I think
you are all mistaken.

568
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,679
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Principal Crosby.

569
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,515
Heard of your performance
last night at Gus's Bar.

570
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,517
Seems you're
qualified for the job.

571
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,395
Jeremy here will be more
than willing to step down.

572
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,063
Am I right?

573
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,292
You didn't think I came up with
this out of thin air, did you?

574
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,360
I've been trying to teach these
kids for the last two weeks.

575
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,696
I can't imagine
how that's going.

576
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:43,114
What happened to
the last teacher?

577
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,408
Teachers. Everyone
in town's tried.

578
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,369
Jeremy was our last resort.

579
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,456
Look, the performance for the
Christmas Gala is in two weeks.

580
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,876
And this is a jacket that
I'd happily hand over.

581
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,213
Does it look like I know the first
thing about Christmas? Or galas?

582
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,465
Jeremy has informed
me of your situation.

583
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,133
You prep these kids

584
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,885
and I'll cover the bus repairs.

585
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,303
And if the kids win,

586
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,222
perhaps you will
leave Harmony Springs

587
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,390
with three percent
of the cash prize.

588
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,850
You can win a gala?

589
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,936
Each school selects
teams to compete.

590
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,522
There's cash prizes, prestige.

591
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,107
Do we have a deal?

592
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,362
All expenses paid,

593
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,239
that engine purrs like a kitten,

594
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,075
and I make it to LA on time.

595
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,451
Yes, yes, and yes.

596
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,999
Well, let's meet these kids.

597
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,002
Thank you.

598
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,712
Write your name on
the chalk board.

599
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,839
I'm going to give
you apples every day.

600
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,509
If teachers were
apples, I'd pick you.

601
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,512
[softly] Jeremy. A word.

602
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,890
After the gala, we have to
shut the music program down.

603
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,017
What the hell are you
talking about, Stanley?

604
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,478
I'm sorry, son.

605
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,148
We just simply can't
keep the program going.

606
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,819
So, uh, you're just gonna do this
without talkin' to my family first?

607
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,737
Or me?

608
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,656
I'm sorry.

609
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,247
Chalk board.

610
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,514
My name is Ms. Travers,

611
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,850
and I'm gonna be
helping you get ready

612
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,562
for the Christmas Eve
Gala in two weeks.

613
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,815
So, let's see what
we're workin' with here.

614
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,483
Let's go around the room

615
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,110
and tell me your name...

616
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,196
Name, musical interest, and
favorite Christmas tradition.

617
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,198
I'll start. I'm Sarah Hughes.

618
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,034
I wanna be an opera singer.

619
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,537
I like leaving food out for
Santa's reindeer on Christmas Eve.

620
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,290
Sarah. Opera. Reindeer. Noted.

621
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,416
You and you.

622
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,209
We're Jeff and
Johnny. I'm Jeff.

623
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,836
I'm Johnny.

624
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,632
We rap. Hoping to one day rock
Harmony Springs with our flow.

625
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,216
[beat boxes]

626

Nice.

634
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,956
And we set traps in our chimney
to see if we can catch a Santa.

635
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,024
- Oh.
- We've never caught one.

636
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,817
- Oh, no.
- Dear God.

637
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,319
There's only one Santa

638
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,863
and Santa doesn't actually
rhyme with Montana.

639
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,406
Just to let you know.

640
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,033
Benjamin still wets the bed.

Hey. Okay, okay, no making
fun of one another, okay?

642
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,579
That's rule number one.

643
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,414
We have to support each other.

644
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,167
Your turn.

645
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,710
I'm Benjamin Donovan.

646
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,605
I like to wear matching
pj's with my mom and dad...

647

while we decorate the Christmas
tree, and I can play the oboe.

648
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,966
Sort of.

649
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,594
Do you all have to play
instruments for this thing?

650
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,137
We don't have to.

651
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,348
Okay, good. 'Cause I'm
not a real music teacher.

652

Mm, we're not really
music students.

00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,354
So, what are your
musical skills then?

654
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,565
And your favorite
Christmas tradition.

655
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,361
Well, uh, I don't have
any Christmas traditions.

Were you hiding back
there the whole time?

Sorry. I'm scared of
strangers and loud noises.

682

But you have a great voice.

to be around more humans.

never stuck around

I did.

697
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,607
Maybe that's your
Christmas tradition.

698
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,858

00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,383
Hey, buddy. I saw you got
the beams up. Looks great.

703
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,510
- [chuckles]
- [Van] Oh, it's wonderful, Abe.

704
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,971
Yeah, you can really see the
rooms starting to take shape.

705
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,182
So, you know they're shutting
down the music program?

706
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,519
Oh, honey. Yeah. Stanley
warned us it might happen.

707
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,398
I just wanted to wait until he
was sure before I said anything.

708
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,108
This meant everything to Parker.

709
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,735
I know, but there were, like,
what, four kids in the class?

710
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,529
- There's five.
- Five.

711
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,866
Five is not enough
to justify the cost.

712
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,076
- I'm sorry.
- [Abe] I'm sorry, son.

713
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,412
But how did Gail do?

714
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,747
She's got a way of making
things better, I guess.

715
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,083
What's this now?

716
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:12,295
Jeremy got the girl with
the bus to teach the kids.

717
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,255
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,423
Gail, huh?

719
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,757
Like the wind.

720
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,677
Gail this, Gail that.

721
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,512
She's been here all of 12 hours.

722
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,764
Can y'all talk
about anything else?

723
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,474
Hey there, Scarlet.

724
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,353
How's the build comin'?

725
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
It's fine.

726
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,610
Uh, we were... We were
just discussing that.

727
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,321
We were talking about how
well it's coming along...

728
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,823
- and what a great view.
- Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,408
That's great, Van.

730
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,619
Blueberry peach.

731
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,704
Just how you guys like it.

732
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,289
Thank you, Scarlet.

733
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,666
[Abe] Thank you, Scarlet.

734
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,001
[Scarlet sighs]

735
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,128
[pleasant music playing]

736
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,477
Livin' the dream.

737
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,159
Wow.

738
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,829
Thought I'd sneak by and get away with
spending a few more nights in there.

739
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,331
- Guess not.
- Mm-mm.

740
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,874
What are you doing
with my stuff?

741
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,417
Uh, I just put it in the box.

742
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,544
You can't stay in there
no more, unfortunately,

743
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:40,091
but my parents, they own a studio a
couple blocks away. You could stay there.

744
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,843
[sighs] I mean, there's a
bunch of stuff layin' around.

745
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,845
Haven't had time to fix
it up to rent it out,

746
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,515
but it's got four
walls and a roof.

747
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,019
Ah... You'll be okay, old girl.

748
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,854
She better be in good hands.

749
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,064
She's in great hands.

750
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,777
My bus, I call her Jewel.

751
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,030
She's the only home
I've ever known.

752
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,158
Well, she is a gem.

753
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,286
I'm glad someone agrees with me.

754
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,373
What happened?

755
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,874
Splinter.

756
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,876
My tip box, it...

757
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,628
- Yeah.
- Tip box?

758
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,590
Someone really
special gave it to me.

759
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,509
I take it to all my gigs,

760
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,761
but it broke in the crash.

761
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,015
Sorry.

762
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,979
Speakin' of sorries,
I owe you one.

763
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,774
I was pretty mean the other
day when you came in there.

764
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:42,653
Any mention of big cities
makes my skin crawl.

765
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,073
So, sorry.

766
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,660
Apology accepted.

767
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,287
You weren't that bad.

768
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,080
I was pretty bad.

769
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,874
So, let me make it up to ya.

770
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,127
Take you to dinner now, and
go look at the studio later?

771
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,673
You know a way to a girl's
heart. I'm starving.

772
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,178
[upbeat music playing]

773
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,932
Smells good.

774
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,143
[Gail] Okay.

775
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,523
Oh! [laughs]

776
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,858
Of course.

777
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,443
It's you! Well...

778
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,196
Okay, my sons Johnny and Jeff...

779
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,990
they told me all about
their new music teacher.

780
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,617
They said, "She's
not a real teacher,

781
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,744
but she can sing and play
piano just like Beyonce."

782
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,121
And I said, "Does
Beyonce play piano?"

783
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,083
And they said, "If she did,
she'd play just like Miss Gail."

784
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,709
And then I said to myself,

785
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,046
"How do I know that name?
Why do I know that name?"

786
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,215
And now I get it. [laughs]

787
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,300
Let me get you a table.

788
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,260
Bruce! Get the
sauce by the door.

789
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,405
Come on, honey. This way, we're
goin' right to this table right here.

790
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,865
[Jeremy] Hey. Did you
hear she almost hit Eddie?

791
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,973
[Rachael] What? Eddie?

792
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,892
- No!
- Yeah, right here.

793
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,560
You happened to Eddie?

794
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,230
- Guilty. Guilty.
- No. It's okay, darlin'.

795
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,650
Listen, that alpaca is
like half deer. I swear.

796
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,860
Something comes at
it, it just like...

797
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,325
Deer in headlights.

798
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,662
[both laughing]

799
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,998
- [Rachael] Whoo!
- [all laughing]

800
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,500
I'm just messing
with you, darlin'.

801
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,918
[Gail] Wow.

802
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,504
So, where you headin'
once your bus is done?

803
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,674
- I have a gig in LA.
- Oh!

804
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,969
And if it all goes well,
I'll tour all over the world.

805
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,347
She'd be on her way
to being a big deal.

806
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,017
Well, that's a huge
deal. With who?

807
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,311
They'll pair us with
the right fit, you know.

808
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,081
It's a good thing I'm used
to living on the road.

809
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,442
Well, listen. I am gonna get
you the Lumberjack platter.

810
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,961
You know, just a little
bit of everything.

811
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,195
No, no, no. Come on
now, that feeds six.

812
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,240
You can take some
home. [laughs]

813
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,784
Lumberjack platter?
What is that?

814
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,578
It's just a whole lot of food.

815
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,746
Plus, it'll make a great
photo for your Instagram.

816
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,748
I'm surprised you even
know what that is.

817
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,625
I ain't livin' in a hole here.

818
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,836
I gave it up.

819
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,838
I gave up all my social media.

820
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,464
Color me intrigued.

821
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,568
Sometimes when things aren't
working, you unplug for a bit

822
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,385
- before you plug back in.
- Hmm.

823
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,721
Life's no different.

824
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,433
I haven't been this
unplugged since I was eight.

825
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,935
Well, here we go.

826
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,980
- Oh, boy.
- Two Oklahoma extra oma palomas.

827
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,983
Now, you tell your friends
in LA about that. [laughs]

828
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,151
Wow.

829
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,907
To LA.

830
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,909
Oh, so now you're
pro big cities?

831
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,411
Can't make it big without
a big city, right?

832
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,164
Cheers.

833
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,373
Cheers.

834
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,250
[man] Thanks.

835
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,616
[Jeremy] So, just so you
know, I wasn't lying.

836
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,558
- It's pretty messy in here.
- [laughing]

837
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,689
Now, I know it's not much,

838
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,275
but it's warm.

839
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,861
And bathroom's back there, so...

840
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,615
If Rachael's barbeque wasn't
so good, I'd be outta here.

841
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,535
Um, I know there's some fresh
sheets in one of these boxes...

842
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,954
No, no, no. Not this one.

843
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,917
- This one?
- Yeah, I believe so.

844
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,418
I mean, I know there used to be.

845
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,506
Here you go. Oh.

846
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,802
[Jeremy clears throat]

847
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,178
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

848
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,471
[Gail] Uh...

849
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,806
Forgot to ask you,

850
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,392
uh, what song were
you teaching the kids?

851
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,228
Uh, never got that far.

852
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,751
This being our last song, I don't
know, pick something special.

853
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,816
Hmm.

854
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,360
Sounds like you miss it.

855
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,904
Kinda. Even if the
kids are awful.

856
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,990
Hey. They are not awful.

857
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,283
They're just...

858
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,201
unpolished.

859
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,999
Well, uh, the kids...

860
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,309
they're the heart of this town.

861
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,210
And the word is they
really love you.

862
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,840
That reminds me,
um, Stanley called,

863
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,218
so I guess your class
starts at 8:00 a.m.

864
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,970
I thought this was an
after-school thing?

865
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,181
Mm-mm. Christmas
break. Next two weeks.

866
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,642
- So, good luck.
- Hmm...

867
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,774
8:00 a.m.

868
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,027
When am I gonna write my song?

869
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,240
Miss Travers? Ew!

870
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,161
Uh, sorry. I'm just bringin'
in the rest of your stuff.

871
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,456
This, uh...

872
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,832
This good here?

873
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,753
- Great.
- Cool. Um...

874
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,755

00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,840
Girl could stick around
for this kinda cooking.

1053
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,803
So, you live here?

1054
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:24,057
For now. It's just easier while
I build it for my parents.

1055
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,727
This could be the sweetest
thing you could do for someone.

1056
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:33,066
These walls you've created will hold
your family's most precious moments.

1057
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:38,613
Never really thought
about it like that.

1058
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,574
You should tell me
about your family.

1059
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,953
I, uh...

1060
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,332
I never knew my parents.

1061
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,003
I never had a house.

1062
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,796
I was a foster kid.

1063
00:52:56,214 --> 00:53:00,719
I grew up in the system
from the day I was born.

1064
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,638
Run of bad luck got me
bounced around several times

1065
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,765
until I hit 18.

1066
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,936
I had my guitar, my music...

1067
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,188
that was my home.

1068
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,941
Sorry.

1069
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,068
It wasn't all that bad.

1070
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,613
I had this one foster dad

1071
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,115
who taught me how
to ground myself

1072
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,618
before I sing, you know.

1073
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,412
Use the nervous butterflies
to find my voice.

1074
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,125
Did he create the tip box?

1075
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,794
- Yes, he did.
- Figured.

1076
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,588
Where is he?

1077
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,423
He moved to Canada...

1078
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:43,595
without me, um, for a
business opportunity.

1079
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,223
Foster kids can't
leave the country,

1080
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,809
and we lost touch.

1081
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,813
That's the system for you.

1082
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,400
But what about you?

1083
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,070
Childhood out here
must've been pretty great.

1084
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,780
Yeah.

1085
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,741
I mean, look.

1086
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,594
Yeah, we had the biggest
house up on a hill, you know.

1087
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,621
Nothing but green for
miles. It was great.

1088
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,833
But we couldn't stay.

1089
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,671
Not after my brother died.

1090
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:25,512
But this, it's the least I
can do for taking him away.

1091
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,392
Taking him away?

1092
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,602
He was the star of
the music program.

1093
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,899
Yeah. I mean, he
actually started it.

1094
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,485
His voice was so good, Gail.

1095
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,695
Like yours.

1096
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,992
You know, which is why
I pushed him so hard.

1097
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,996
I had this plan.

1098
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,208
You know, go out to LA so
he can chase his dream.

1099
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,711
I mean, I just got so
caught up in it all.

1100
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,671
Became so self-centered.

1101
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,048
And what happened?

1102
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,675
We were at a party...

1103
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,054
and it was getting late.

1104
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,889
He had a gig the
next day, early,

1105
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,766
and he was exhausted,

1106
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,811
so I just threw him the keys.

1107
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,442
And, uh, he...

1108
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,654
probably fell
asleep at the wheel.

1109
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,157
Hit a curb, lost
control, and that was it.

1110
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,993
Last time I saw my brother.

1111
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,329
I'm so sorry, Jeremy.

1112
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,625
So, you went home,

1113
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,254
and put on all your jackets?

1114
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:46,009
What I'm doing is trying to fill
the hole that he left behind.

1115
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,886
Parker was everything
to Harmony Springs.

1116
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,721
Well, you can't blame yourself.

1117
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,556
[scoffs]

1118
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:55,060
The reason why I stayed is because
Coldplay was gonna be there.

1119
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,148
And I just wanted to
take a picture with them

1120
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,942
to impress some girl
that I didn't even know.

1121
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,235
[sniffles]

1122
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,280
Because of it,

1123
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,866
we never got to see my brother
again over some stupid post.

1124
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,871
Yeah, now, um...

1125
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,122
[smacks lips]

1126
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,916
Now, I get the whole
smartphone thing.

1127
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,168
Hmmm.

1128
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,253
I know what you
must think of me.

1129
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,633
Desperate to update my story

1130
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,844
for a whole bunch of
people I've never even met.

1131
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,304
No.

1132
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,891
I mean, it's a priority
for your career. I get it.

1133
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,185
Hmm.

1134
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,020
I'll tell you what, though.

1135
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,858
I like the unplugged
Gail a whole lot better.

1136
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,363
I do, too.

1137
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,792
[indistinct chatter]

1138
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,794
- Did he kiss her yet?
- I don't know.

1139
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,339
Are they 12 years old?

1140
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,299
This is too much.

1141
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:09,467
Oh, man.

1142
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,929

[Abe] How'd Rachael take it?

1163
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,960
Not so good.

1164
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,295
She's a crier.

1165
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,256
So, with this
singing gig you have,

1166
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,966
what happens after the show?

1167
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,801
Well, she's actually
gonna hit the road.

1168
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,344
She's gonna go on tour now.

1169
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,013
And yeah. She'll be on her
way to becoming a huge star.

1170
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,474
Making some albums
and all that jazz.

1171
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:23,476
- Wow.
- Hmm.

1172
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:24,769
Yeah.

1173
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,021
I spent my whole life
on the road, so...

1174
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,065
kinda used to it.

1175
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,486
So, who's gonna finish
getting the kids ready?

1176
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:35,446
He's sitting right next to me.

1177
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,115
- Oh.
- [Gail laughs]

1178
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,491
- Okay.
- Our son?

1179
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,451
Uh-uh. I do not think so.

1180
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,662
That boy cannot sing a lick.

1181
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,622
Don't worry. They're ready.

1182
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,709
You have to get them
on the stage, okay?

1183
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,419
Yeah. Gotcha.

1184
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,006
He'll do it.

1185
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,008
I'm gonna miss you all so much.

1186
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,476
I should get going. I have
a few more things to pack,

1187
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,686
finish the song.

1188
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,271
I'll see you later, yeah?

1189
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,606
- Yeah, see you later.
- Okay.

1190
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,235
Here, no. I got
it. I'll get this.

1191
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,989
- First time in his life.
- Go.

1192
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,615
Go on now. Git!

1193
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,427
-Thank you for dinner. It was delicious.
-[Abe] Thank you.

1194
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,619
- [Van] You're welcome.
- [Abe] So glad you could come.

- [knocking at door]
- Come in.

1203
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,074
[Scarlet] I'm sorry.

1204
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,658
Am I interrupting something?

1205
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,912
I just wanted to make
sure I bid my farewell.

1206
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,830
What are you doing for Jer?

1207
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,666
What?

1208
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,379
You're not giving him a
thank you of any kind?

1209
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,589
He's the gesture type.

1210
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:19,384
I've been so busy, I didn't
even think about that.

1211
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,094
[Scarlet] Mm-hmm.

1212
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,137
You live in your van, right?

1213
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,639
Mm-hmm.

1214
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,891
So you're good
with small spaces.

1215
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,521
Why don't I help you set
some of this stuff up?

1216
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,692
Oh, my gosh.

1217
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,277
Look.

1218
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,155
I remember this being
right about here.

1219
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,616
You sure he won't mind?

1220
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:47,453
Girl, he's been dying to
tidy up this space. Trust me.

1221
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,372
He did say they
haven't had time...

1222
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,581
Exactly!

1223
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,084
It'll take less than
an hour. Come on.

1224
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,839

1402
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:44,581
It's not what you think.

1403
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,999
I know what I saw.

1404
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,257
Does it matter?

I mean...

borrowed time here, Gail.

What is that supposed to mean?

1408
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,521
The world needs to hear
that voice of yours.

1409
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:10,232
You can't do that from here.

1410
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,443
What you did last night...

1411
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,738

- [sighs]
- So, that's it then?

1417
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,508

01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:01,698
There.

-We won't need it.
-We could make us... That's true.

1593
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,827
- We won't need it.
- Well, maybe, we won't.

[clears throat] Hello?

1595
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,247
Hello?

1596
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,474
Don't, who is it? Don't
tell me you have to

1597
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:11,725
- go to the shop.
- Oh, hey, honey.

1598
01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:14,210
It's Gail. Hey,
hey, hey, honey.

<i>Are you okay? Is
everything all right?</i>

1600
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,548
How many times have
you asked me that now?

1601
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:21,676
Hurry up.

1602
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:24,846
I sure wish I could
see your face.

1603
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,681
You're gonna need a
new phone for that.

1604
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,185
What's goin' on?

1605
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,772
I didn't know who else to call.

1606
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,902
I don't know what
to do. Everything...

1607
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,821
Everything here is
just so different.

1608
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,281
What do you mean?

1609
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,967
<i>There's just so many
people. So many people.</i>

1610
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,368
They're just trying
to plan my style,

1611
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,454
my identity, my future...

1612
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:53,124
There's just so many voices

1613
01:26:53,207 --> 01:26:55,418
that I feel like
I'm losing mine.

1614
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:57,045
Oh.

1615
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,923
Okay.

1616
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,550
When you started singing,

1617
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,719
what did you want
out of all of it?

1618
01:27:04,802 --> 01:27:06,554
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1619
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,514
I want to sing
because I love it.

1620
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:10,975
But why this way?

1621
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,353
Fans.

1622
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:17,565
Because?

1623
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,693
Well, they're the only ones
who ever stuck around for me.

1624
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:22,654
Oh.

1625
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:26,240
That's not what fans are for,
that's what family's for.

1626
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:29,744
<i>Now I know that you didn't have
one for a very long time...</i>

1627
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:34,999

1628
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,127
<i>And sweetheart, no matter how far,
no matter how long you're gone,</i>

<i>you can always come
back here, Gail.</i>

1630
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,717
Harmony Springs is here for you.

1631
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:49,722
<i>And listen, if those fans don't
love you for who you truly are...</i>

1632
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,016
<i>I don't think you
really want this.</i>

1633
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,187
Maybe you're right.

1634
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,443
I'm probably overstepping here,

1635
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,696
but, um, Jeremy told
me what happened.

1636
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,031
<i>And I just... I just
need you to know that</i>

1637
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,574
it wasn't what you thought.

1638
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:12,370
<i>Jeremy told Scarlet
how he really felt...</i>

1639
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,497
<i>about you.</i>

1640
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,833
He just didn't wanna
be the reason that

1641
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:18,918
you second-guess
this opportunity.

1642
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:26,801
Okay. Well, we love you.

1643
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,846
I love you, too.

1644
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,890
All of you in Harmony Springs.

1645

<i>- Oh, Van?</i>
- Yeah?

1646
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,563
Could you remind the kids
to sing from the heart

1647
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:42,358
<i>tonight at the gala? The county
is not gonna know what hit 'em.</i>

1648
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,653
I just wish that I could
be there to see it.

1649
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:48,656
Thank you.

1650
01:28:49,782 --> 01:28:50,783
Bye.

- [faucet running]
- She's right, you know.

1653
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:12,513
Your mom.

1654
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:17,685
Oh, she's not...
She's not my...

1655
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:21,731
Anyway, um, I'm sorry that
you had to hear all that.

1656
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:23,566
You don't have to explain.

1657
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,651
I've been exactly where you are.

1658
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,320
But, Gail, you're good.

1659
01:29:27,403 --> 01:29:28,738
I mean, really good.

1660
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:31,115
With or without
that record label.

1661
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,700
Thank you.

1662
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,762
And do you know how many times
people have tried to get me

1663
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,080
to be cuter, girlier,

1664
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:40,458
more country, less
country. I mean...

1665
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,126
I can't keep up.

1666
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:46,172
But I learned to hold on to
my favorite version of myself.

1667
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:50,551
So you've got to hang on
tight to what makes you you.

1668
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,304
You have to remember
that's what got you here.

1669
01:29:53,387 --> 01:29:57,767
And I promise if you do that,
Gail, the sky's the limit.

1670
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:00,436
Thank you, Amy.

it's in your inbox.

1672

So, I want you to know, if
you need to get to that gala,

1673
01:30:05,858 --> 01:30:08,319
you got a plane ticket,
you got a car service.

1674
01:30:08,402 --> 01:30:11,906
Seriously, whatever
you need you decide.

1675
01:30:11,989 --> 01:30:14,158
- But what about my bus?
- It's handled.

1676
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,535
Done.

1677
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,372
Good luck, Gail Travers.

- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

Release your intentions.

I'm sure those are really
great intentions, guys.

1693
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,278
- You made it!
- Yes!

1694
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:36,574
How in the world could I
miss it? You guys look great!

1695
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,075
Wow.

1696
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,578
Okay, people. Look alive.
We're on in three minutes.

1697
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,080
Okay, let's all head toward
backstage, okay? Come on.

1698
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,790
- Come on.
- Okay. Come on, people.

01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:46,667
Okay.

Hey, what's goin' on, Rosemary?

1702
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,174
It's just, there's... There's
a lot of people out there.

1703
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:58,179
Our class was small and...

1704
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:00,389
I can't sing in front
of that many humans.

1705
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,433
Hey. Hey...

1706
01:32:02,516 --> 01:32:06,562
You taught me that being
perfect isn't better.

1707
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,315
Whatever happens out there,

1708
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,317
it's you.

1709
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,863
And I haven't met one single
human who hasn't loved you.

1710
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,157
Show 'em you, okay?

1711
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,408
You got this.

1712
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:43,056
You know...

1713
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,311
the whole "If you love
her, let her go" thing...

1714
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:51,524
doesn't work every time.

1715
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,737
Sorry. That whole, uh...

1716
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:58,382
[clears throat] That
whole Scarlet thing...

1717
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,490
I know.

1718
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:01,074
I know.

1719
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:07,248
You... You know I took
Parker from his dream.

1720
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,879
Couldn't do that with you.

1721
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:23,889
He made a choice and
now I'm making one.

1722
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:32,064
I always hoped that somehow my singing
would bring me to a home of my own.

1723
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:39,530
I've never felt more loved
or seen than I do right here.

1724
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:48,122
I always thought that I couldn't
write songs because I wasn't good...

1725
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:54,086
but now I realize that I
just needed something...

1726
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:59,008
someone to write songs about.

1727
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,880
- What's your plan?
- Here's my plan.

1728
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:22,406
I stick around and keep
teaching the music program,

1729
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,824
if you'll have me.

1730
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,327
Uh, I can't do that. We
just gave the job away.

1731
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:27,953
Oh, man.

1732
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:29,538
- I'm kidding.
- [chuckles]

1733
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,123
You might just save the program.

1734
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,935
Speaking of which,
we... We'd better go.

1735
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:35,145
Come on, we got a show to watch.

1736
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:36,504
- Let's go. Let's go.
