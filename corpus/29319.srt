1
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
The flight was terrible.

2
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,840
I told you I’d make it.

3
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,480
I told you she was beautiful.

4
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,600
Nadia. Meet my new guitarist Alexei.

5
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,400
You'll love him, he's a riot.

6
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,280
Happy Birthday.

7
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,920
Get some glasses.

8
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,320
How do you say friend in English?

9
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,560
Is it Ok me being here?


10
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,600
What?

11
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I've put on a few pounds.

12
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,320
Don't tease him.

13
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,640
Can I have a light?

14
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,280
Some Rabbit?

15
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,120
You've got something on your face.

16
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,320
Stop that!

17
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,160
I won!

18
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,160
What the hell are you doing?

19
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,040
I couldn't breathe!

20
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,440
You bastard.

21
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't ever touch me again!

22
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,840
I told you to leave her alone.

23
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Keep out of this.

24
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,320
You're throwing me out?

25
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,840
You think you're better than me?

26
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
I beg you.

27
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,520
Let's see if lover boy has any balls.

28
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,120
What?

29
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
You with your nice job.

30
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,000
And your big house.

31
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,720
And you still have to pay for a women.

32
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,080
Let's see what she's worth to you.

33
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,080
Bread.

34
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,240
Money.

35
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
I love you.

36
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,560
I'll always love you.

37
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,440
Guess?

38
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,760
Fifty thousand.

39
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,320
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.

40
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,200
There's over ninety grand here.

41
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,680
Split it up three ways.

42
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,560
You owe me 150 pounds.

43
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,480
What for?

44
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,280
I've been shelling out for you all week.

45
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,760
What have you bought me?

46
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,360
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe.

47
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,000
When we went to see "Cats".

48
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,920
Who paid?

49
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,280
That's normal friendship stuff.

50
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Tightwad.

51
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,160
What was "Cats" like?

52
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,680
Not bad.

53
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,240
Yeah it was so-so.

54
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
I gave it three stars.

55
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,720
The sets were good.

56
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
The sets were excellent.

57
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,040
Everything was very big.

58
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
the trash, coke cans...

59
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,000
...so you felt cat size.

60
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,040
It was really clever.

61
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,960
So...

62
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Tell me...

63
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,720
How many times did you have to do it?

64
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,040
Two?

65
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,760
Three?

66
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,680
You scared me with the kettle.

67
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,520
It's enough isn't it.

68
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,560
We can stop now.

69
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,560
Do you want to stop?

70
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
Yes.

71
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,760
Well, stop then.

72
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,960
What's this?

73
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,840
What? It's nothing.

74
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,160
I burnt myself.

75
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,480
A rope burn?

76
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
No. I did it cooking.

77
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,120
You liked this one didn't you?

78
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,360
That's ridiculous. Just drop it.

79
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,720
Are you lying?

80
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,880
And that story?

81
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,920
The binoculars.

82
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,240
Was that true?

83
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm going to that arcade.

84
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,320
They've got GranTurismo.

85
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,600
Have fun.

86
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,160
I made you something

87
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,440
I want to see if it fits

88
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,600
Do you like it?

89
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,120
Say thank you.

90
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,320
You're going to be a father.

91
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm pregnant.

92
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,400
I've been throwing up for weeks.

93
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,160
Aren't you pleased?

94
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,200
What are we supposed to do with a baby?

95
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,880
Think of a name for it.

96
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,520
Dear Nadia.

97
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,920
You are only girl in world.

98
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,800
I dream-to talk.

99
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,040
What will happen?

100
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,960
So you came back to rob me?

101
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,560
Is that it?

102
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,760
So now we're even.

103
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,680
I panicked.

104
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,080
I'm sorry...

105
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,640
...we're square.

106
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,000
I love you.

107
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,040
I’ve still got my ticket home...

108
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,600
...or Spain?

109
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,880
Come with us...

110
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,040
Just one last time.

111
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,480
What the fuck is john doing here?

112
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,720
That's the cigarette lighter...

113
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,640
...I gave you for Christmas, isn’t it?

114
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,040
Don’t hurt him.

115
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,040
What do you care?

116
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,440
He came here with me

117
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,240
You mean...

118
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,760
You mean you're together?

119
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,040
No we're not.

120
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,760
I told you.

121
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,000
I knew...

122
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,920
...I knew something was going on.

123
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,760
You don't know anything.

124
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,840
and you don't own me.

125
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,320
If you love him so much

126
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,160
Let's see you do it.

127
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,120
do it.

128
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:25,880
Come on.

129
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,040
Show me.

130
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,800
Don't do this.

131
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:36,680
I'll make a big mess here.

132
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,040
You know I'll do it.

133
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,360
You hate me.

134
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,520
You hate me.
135
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,640
And I showed you the world.

136
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,360
Don't leave me here.

137
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,120
At least leave me my share.

138
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,080
You know...

139
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,960
...You're always surprising me.

140
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,880
What will happen?

141
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,560
Fuck a Duck.

142
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,720
Are you Ok?

143
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,920
Are you scared?

144
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,240
Are you a giraffe?
