1
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,361
No, please! No! Please!

2
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,030
Davey!

3
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,526
- Come running, lad!
- Please don't!

4
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,863
- Stop it!
- Brand you like a damn steer!

5
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:09,769
- Bitch!
- No, please!

6
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,042
Hold the bitch! Hold her!

7
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,613
Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!

8
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:18,717
Go get Skinny! Quick!

9
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,720
Mike, don't!

10
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,116
Skinny!

11
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:30,223
Think it's funny?

12
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,457
Skinny, get the gun!

13
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,143
Get off of her, cowboy.

14
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,653
- They wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

15
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,484
He says he'll shoot them.

16
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:02,094
I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."

17
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,924
I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.

18
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,658
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,614
She dying?

20
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,677
She'll live.

21
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,845
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,614
When she seen his
teensy little pecker...

23
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,625
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,028
Hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,884
Go to the office and get the bullwhip.

26
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:09,658
A whipping's all they
get after what they done?

27
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,159
- It ain't no little thing.
- But what they done...

28
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:15,733
Alice!

29
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,392
Shut up!

30
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:22,841
- Whipping won't settle this.
- No?

31
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,902
Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

32
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:33,008
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

33
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,912
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

34
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:38,517
Property.

35
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,552
Damaged property.

36
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,360
Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.

37
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,026
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

38
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:51,267
Hell, no!

39
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,436
Leastways, won't pay to do it!

40
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:58,105
Nobody's going to pay good money
for a cut-up whore!

41
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,541
You boys are off the Bar T.

42
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:05,878
Got your own ponies?

43
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,217
Yeah, I got four.

44
00:05:11,224 --> 00:05:12,555
Six.

45
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:17,058
Guess you want no trial, no fuss?

46
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:19,064
No, sir.

47
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,957
All right.

48
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,225
You did the cutting.

49
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:27,232
This fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny.

50
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:29,135
Five?

51
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:30,740
And you...

52
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,241
...bring two.

53
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,573
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,776
The whip.

55
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,577
Maybe we don't need it now.

56
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:47,752
I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies...

57
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:52,159
- ...I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

58
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,428
I fined them instead, Alice.

59
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,332
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

60
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,498
That ain't fair.

61
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,199
That ain't fair!

62
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,950
Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?

63
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,281
Hell, Alice...

64
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:23,956
...it ain't like they was
tramps or loafers or...

65
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,961
...bad men. They were just...

66
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:29,295
...hardworking boys that were foolish.

67
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:33,470
- If they was wicked in a regular way-
- Like whores?

68
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,204
Tend to Delilah.

69
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:40,975
Go ahead.

70
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,228
I got $85.

71
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,736
I don't know.

72
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,740
If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

73
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:14,340
We let them smelly fools
ride us like horses...

74
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,847
...doesn't mean we must let
them brand us like horses.

75
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:20,918
Maybe we ain't nothing
but whores, but...

76
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,521
...by God, we ain't horses!

77
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,852
I got $112.

78
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,026
That's everything.

79
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:31,754
And you, Faith?

80
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,124
200.

81
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,538
240...dollars.

82
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,108
Jesus, what you been doing?

83
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,937
Giving Skinny something special?

84
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:53,379
She laughs.

85
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,953
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue...

86
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:01,787
It ain't enough.

87
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,791
Not yet, maybe.

88
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:50,273
You don't look like no son-of-a-
bitching cold-blooded assassin.

89
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:57,677
Say what?

90
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,447
You call yourself Mr. William Munny.

91
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,114
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

92
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,686
Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?

93
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:11,953
Hey, Pa!

94
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,688
What, son?

95
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,858
Two more hogs got the fever.

96
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:17,959
You shot Charlie Pepper.

97
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:21,534
You killed William Harvey and
robbed that train in Missouri.

98
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,039
Hold on.

99
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:27,044
Son, get those hogs separated there.

100
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,143
Penny, help your brother.

101
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,646
That one's sick too.

102
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,647
We'll talk inside.

103
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,223
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

104
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:53,905
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

105
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,340
I could have.

106
00:09:57,844 --> 00:09:58,708
Easy.

107
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,741
I guess maybe so.

108
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:09,181
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

109
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,247
Maybe I ain't.

110
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:16,862
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

111
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,521
And if I wanted a
partner for a killing...

112
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,864
...you were the worst one.

113
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,269
Meaning the best.

114
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,201
Because you're as cold as snow...

115
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,277
...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

116
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,611
Pete said that?

117
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:40,549
He did.

118
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:45,115
I'm a killer myself, but I
haven't killed as many as you...

119
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,054
...because of my youth.

120
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,717
Schofield Kid, they call me.

121
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,788
Why?

122
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,458
You from Schofield?

123
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,799
No, it's on account of my...

124
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:02,466
...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.

125
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,812
How about it?

126
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,408
How about what?

127
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:14,082
How about being my partner?

128
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,320
I'm heading north in
through Niobrara to Wyoming.

129
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,150
Kill two no-good cowboys.

130
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,125
For what?

131
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,327
For cutting up a lady.

132
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,330
Her face.

133
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,433
Cut her eyes out, her ears off.

134
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,428
They even cut her teets.

135
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,175
Jesus.

136
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,173
$1,000 reward, Will.

137
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:44,014
500 each.

138
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,615
I can't move those damn pigs!

139
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:53,288
Watch your cussing.

140
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,519
Do your best. Go to the
pump and get cleaned up.

141
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,288
Come on.

142
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,132
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

143
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,041
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

144
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,643
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

145
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,638
My wife...

146
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,706
...cured me...

147
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,544
...of drink and...

148
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,049
...wickedness.

149
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,155
You don't look so prosperous.

150
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:32,228
You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

151
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:35,160
You could buy your wife a fancy...

152
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,234
She's passed on.

153
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,672
Been gone near three years now.

154
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:54,752
Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.

155
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:56,886
Don't see no one.

156
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:01,349
Change your mind, you could catch me.

157
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:05,086
I'll ride due west for the
trail headed north into Wyoming.

158
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,204
Let's separate those hogs.

159
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:44,997
Two others.

160
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,736
I think they got the fever.

161
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,629
Took you boys a while.

162
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:52,127
A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

163
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:53,971
How about that?

164
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,199
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

165
00:14:57,476 --> 00:15:00,309
I bet. Get them horses to the livery.

166
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,141
Take that one over around the back.

167
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,051
Now here's a beauty.

168
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,492
You got my two. This one ain't yours.

169
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:18,493
We'll see about that.

170
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,565
Bastards! Get out of town!

171
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:24,727
Get out of here!

172
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,997
You are very sick sons-of-bitches!

173
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,076
Don't come back, butcher!

174
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,836
This here pony...

175
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:38,415
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

176
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:51,853
She's the best.

177
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,928
Better than what I gave him.

178
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:05,440
She can sell her...

179
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,708
...or do what she wants.

180
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,781
A pony?

181
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:16,718
She ain't got no face left
and you give her a mangy pony?

182
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,447
She ain't mangy!

183
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,787
Get out of here!

184
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,786
We don't need your goddamn charity!

185
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,893
Get out of our town and don't come back!

186
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,903
Get out of our town!

187
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,205
Did Pa use to kill folks?

188
00:18:55,714 --> 00:18:59,047
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

189
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:03,482
She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.

190
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,386
Take care of your sister, son.

191
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,223
Kill a few chickens if you must and
keep those hogs with fever separate.

192
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:15,831
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

193
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,193
Ain't been in the saddle
myself in a while.

194
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:52,028
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

195
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:56,439
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

196
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:00,040
...I was weak and given
to mistreating animals.

197
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,949
This horse and those hogs over there...

198
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,117
...are getting even for
the cruelty I inflicted.

199
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:19,728
I used to be able to cuss
and whip a horse like this...

200
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,800
...but your ma showed me
the error of my ways.

201
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,128
I'll be back in 2 weeks.

202
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:30,970
The spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

203
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:52,092
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

204
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,323
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was Iying!

205
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:57,595
Lying?

206
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,828
What if somebody comes to collect?

207
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:05,610
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

208
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:12,510
The people come for that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

209
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,281
They won't just cut up your face!

210
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:24,689
You stupid bitches.

211
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,624
Stupid bitches.

212
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,038
Shit!

213
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,304
Damn it! Jesus!

214
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:47,016
Get your finger?

215
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,988
Hello, Skinny.

216
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,321
You snuck up on me.

217
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,659
Like her?

218
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:58,996
I heard you done the roof yourself.

219
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,559
Roof?

220
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:04,066
Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

221
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:08,170
The Roberts boy carried wood
for me, but that's all.

222
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:09,999
What's that wood?

223
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:15,507
I'm building a porch here so I can
sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...

224
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:19,247
...and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

225
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,184
Came out here just to
take a look at her?

226
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:26,186
Them whores...

227
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:31,529
...been humping all them cowboys been
through town the last two weeks.

228
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:33,889
Shit.

229
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:39,360
We got railroad barons
and cattle barons.

230
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:41,870
You'll be the first billiard baron.

231
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:46,105
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

232
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:49,604
...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...

233
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:52,876
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

234
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,386
Those cowboys are riding that
beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

235
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,798
All week long?

236
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,400
I didn't hear till last night myself.

237
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:15,467
The word's got all the
way to Texas by now.

238
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:19,070
Nobody will come clear from Texas.

239
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:23,410
They got all that money?

240
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:28,476
Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

241
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,981
But the five of them could have it.

242
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:33,818
Maybe.

243
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,093
That much?

244
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,756
You could run off them two cowboys.

245
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,759
I could run off them whores.

246
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,665
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

247
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:56,947
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

248
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,345
Close to their friends.

249
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,016
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

250
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,790
Got to go. I like your house.

251
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:47,996
It's Will.

252
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:56,998
Come in out of the sun.

253
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,000
See to Will's horse.

254
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,415
What you doing here?

255
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,184
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

256
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:14,519
We ain't bad men no more.

257
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,523
We're farmers.

258
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:21,196
Should be easy killing them, if
they don't go on down to Texas.

259
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:27,435
How long since you fired a gun
at a man, Will? Ten years?

260
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,769
Eleven.

261
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:33,942
Easy, huh?

262
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,043
It wasn't all that easy even back then.

263
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:40,547
And we were young and full of beans.

264
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,444
If you was mad at them...

265
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:46,786
...over some wrong, I
could see shooting them.

266
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:50,119
We done stuff for money before.

267
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,457
We thought we did.

268
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,729
What'd these fellows do?

269
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,734
Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

270
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,741
They cut up a woman.

271
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:12,581
Cut her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

272
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:16,985
Everything but her cunny, I suppose.

273
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,485
I'll be dogged.

274
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,830
Guess they got it coming.

275
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,925
Of course, Will...

276
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,103
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

277
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:47,282
Could you look in on my
youngsters next week?

278
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,953
Got some hogs to separate.

279
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,353
How long will you be gone?

280
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,621
Two weeks, I guess.

281
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,134
What's this Kid like?

282
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:16,645
Three ways?

283
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,483
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

284
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:26,649
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

285
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:37,567
Jesus.

286
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,952
He must be moving right along.

287
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:40,126
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

288
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:55,736
Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.

289
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:00,415
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

290
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:07,290
Hell, I'm sorry.

291
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:10,488
Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.

292
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,426
She don't like it much...

293
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,329
...you riding off with me.

294
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,332
Gave me the evil eye.

295
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,608
You know, Sally's Indian and...

296
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,440
...Indians ain't over-friendly.

297
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,273
I don't blame her.

298
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:36,610
I won't hold it against her.

299
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,779
She knew me back then.

300
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,781
She knew what a...

301
00:29:41,293 --> 00:29:43,784
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

302
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,192
She ain't allowing that I changed.

303
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,800
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

304
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,370
- You know women.
- I ain't the same, Ned.

305
00:29:55,807 --> 00:30:00,642
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

306
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,641
Going on this killing...

307
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:06,716
...don't mean I'll go
back to the way I was.

308
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:10,149
Just need the money.

309
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,989
Get a new start for them youngsters.

310
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:21,063
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

311
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,895
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

312
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:29,333
I think about him now and again.

313
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,243
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

314
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,914
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

315
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:46,851
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.

316
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:51,689
No one liked me.

317
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:55,697
The boys all thought I'd shoot
them out of pure meanness.

318
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,261
You ain't like that no more.

319
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:03,370
Eagle, he hated my guts.

320
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,605
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

321
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:09,944
Quincy neither, I reckon.

322
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:15,378
Quincy used to just watch all the time.

323
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:18,279
Scared.

324
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,949
Like I said...

325
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,385
...you ain't like that no more.

326
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:26,730
That's right.

327
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,224
I'm just a fellow now.

328
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:33,303
I ain't no different than anyone else.

329
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:35,303
No more.

330
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:52,416
What son-of-a-bitch shot him?

331
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:55,319
Was it one of them John Bulls?

332
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,991
No, sir.

333
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:01,599
The would-be assassin is a gentleman
of French ancestry. Or so it seems.

334
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,333
I don't wish to give offense, but...

335
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:08,767
...the French are known to
be a race of assassins...

336
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,998
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

337
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:14,668
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

338
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,846
Says here a fellow by
the name of Guiteau.

339
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:23,181
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

340
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,352
Again, I don't wish to give offense...

341
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:30,688
...when I suggest that
this country select...

342
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,298
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

343
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:39,126
One isn't that quick to
shoot a king or a queen.

344
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:42,033
The majesty of royalty, you see.

345
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:48,035
Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir...

346
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:50,474
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

347
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:53,648
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

348
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:56,649
- When I heard about queens-
- Shut up, Joe.

349
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:59,483
What's wrong with you? This dude...

350
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:02,659
Might be this dude here is English Bob.

351
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:06,729
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

352
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:09,558
Might be waiting for some cowboy...

353
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,726
...to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him.

354
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:26,347
Is that a fact, mister?

355
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:29,083
You English Bob?

356
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,748
Pheasants.

357
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,186
Let's shoot some pheasants.

358
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:38,693
Ten shots.

359
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,694
And let's say $1 a pheasant.

360
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:45,532
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...

361
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,531
...whomever.

362
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,947
That's 8 for me and 1 for you.

363
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:08,786
That comes to 7 American dollars.

364
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:11,453
Pretty damn good shooting...

365
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,794
...for a John Bull.

366
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:17,065
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

367
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:21,964
...over the injury to your President.

368
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:38,249
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

369
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,582
Does what?

370
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:43,087
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

371
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,660
It's a savage country, really.

372
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:50,926
That's the second one
they shot in 20 years.

373
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:54,931
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

374
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,327
Thank you.

375
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,490
Pardon me, gentlemen.

376
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:02,331
The law obliges you to
surrender all sidearms...

377
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:05,169
...to the proper authorities
during your visit.

378
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,508
Proper authority?

379
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:12,172
I can assure you...

380
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,013
...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.

381
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:20,357
We rely upon the goodwill of
our fellow man and the...

382
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,026
...forbearance of reptiles.

383
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:38,574
Unarmed, my ass.

384
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,008
Christ, it's hot.

385
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:45,511
If I'm going to get shot, I'd
rather it was hot than cold.

386
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:49,077
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

387
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,551
- If you hit your thumb-
- Shut up, Fatty!

388
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,015
- I only said-
- Clyde's back.

389
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,290
- With Little Bill?
- No.

390
00:36:58,029 --> 00:36:59,189
Shit.

391
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,369
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

392
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:10,464
Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?

393
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,533
Building his damn porch.

394
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,678
Building his porch?

395
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:18,614
If you got shot, would you want
it to be a hot or cold day?

396
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,613
I ain't going to get shot.

397
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:23,715
He's coming?

398
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:26,480
Of course he's coming.

399
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:28,715
I just loaded that.

400
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:31,987
I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for a shooting.

401
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:34,487
What he say?

402
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:37,993
Little Bill said he
was building his porch.

403
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:40,397
You seen that thing?

404
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:42,233
It was all loaded.

405
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:45,237
You got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

406
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:48,869
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

407
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:54,743
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

408
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:57,246
Or the whole house, for that matter!

409
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,752
He is the worst damn carpenter.

410
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,087
He didn't say nothing?

411
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,851
Asked what they looked like.

412
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,264
Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

413
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,532
Maybe he ain't so tough.

414
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,433
Seem like he was scared?

415
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,367
Little Bill? Him scared?

416
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:22,876
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

417
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:24,103
Killers.

418
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,613
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

419
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,380
He worked them tough towns.

420
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:33,055
Just wondered.

421
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,927
Anybody could be scared.

422
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:43,957
He wasn't scared, boys.

423
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:46,967
He just ain't no carpenter.

424
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:57,979
There's a dignity in royalty which
precludes the likelihood of assassination.

425
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,141
If you pointed a pistol at a queen...

426
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,913
...your hands would shake as if palsied.

427
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,420
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

428
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:09,816
Always a wise policy.

429
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:13,222
But if you did, I can assure you...

430
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:17,992
...the sight of royalty would cause you
to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.

431
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,831
You would stand, how should I put it...

432
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,231
...in awe.

433
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:26,933
Now, a President...

434
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:30,103
Well, why not shoot the President?

435
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:37,677
Keep the change.

436
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,689
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

437
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:45,693
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

438
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,454
Say you want a game of billiards.

439
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:49,622
Billiards?

440
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:52,031
Even though I don't wish to play?

441
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:55,639
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

442
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,699
Right.

443
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,035
Quite right.

444
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:02,274
Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea...

445
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:18,657
Hello, Bob.

446
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:23,790
Boys, this here is English Bob.

447
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:27,227
Shit and fried eggs.

448
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,299
Been a long time.

449
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,067
Run out of Chinamen?

450
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,671
I thought that you were dead.

451
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,242
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

452
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:46,179
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

453
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,182
Actually, what I heard was you...

454
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:52,194
...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.

455
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,092
And that you broke your bloody neck.

456
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,593
I heard that one myself, Bob.

457
00:40:58,836 --> 00:41:00,827
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

458
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,700
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

459
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:06,402
Who's he?

460
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:08,442
W.W. Beauchamp.

461
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:12,276
This is Little Bill Daggett.

462
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,210
And friends, of course.

463
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,780
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

464
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:21,055
In person.

465
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,960
You work for the railroads too?

466
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,124
I write.

467
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,225
Letters?

468
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:32,466
Books, Bill. Books.

469
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:34,631
Actually...

470
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:37,130
...he's my biographer.

471
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,805
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

472
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:55,149
It's only a book.

473
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,752
A book?

474
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,691
That means you boys can read.

475
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,002
That means you saw the signs...

476
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:11,335
...saying surrender your firearms.

477
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,602
But like you told young Andy...

478
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,110
...you're not armed, are you?

479
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,346
Not really, Bill.

480
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:27,352
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

481
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:31,186
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

482
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,126
I'm afraid so, Bob.

483
00:42:34,866 --> 00:42:36,800
I don't like firearms around.

484
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,723
Be very careful with it, sonny.

485
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,965
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

486
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:16,563
Make sure you don't get wet.

487
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,846
No shit.

488
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:27,974
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

489
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:32,680
"The Duck of Death?"

490
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:33,982
Duke.

491
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:37,492
"The Duke."

492
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:42,598
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

493
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,767
I'll have that.32, Bob.

494
00:43:58,215 --> 00:43:59,614
Now, Little Bill.

495
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:03,610
You will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

496
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:09,888
Enemies?

497
00:44:13,297 --> 00:44:15,891
You been talking about the Queen again?

498
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:18,729
On Independence Day?

499
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:33,313
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

500
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:36,477
But it ain't so!

501
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:38,755
What I'm doing is talking!

502
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:39,945
Hear?!

503
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:42,925
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

504
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,654
To all those villains in Missouri!

505
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:54,668
And those villains...

506
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,941
...down in Cheyenne!

507
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:06,275
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

508
00:45:11,856 --> 00:45:14,950
Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it...

509
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,322
...anyhow!

510
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,048
What are you looking at?!

511
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,522
Go on!

512
00:45:56,901 --> 00:45:58,892
Mind your own business!

513
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:29,155
Ever go into town?

514
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:31,765
On occasion.

515
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,436
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

516
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:37,937
I mean, get yourself a woman.

517
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,675
No, I never go into town for that.

518
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:45,671
A man like me?

519
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:50,284
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

520
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:53,552
That ain't right, buying flesh.

521
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:58,055
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that.

522
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:00,058
Me being a father, and all.

523
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:06,792
You just use your hand?

524
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,140
I don't miss it all that much.

525
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,332
Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!

526
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:41,168
You hit?

527
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:46,101
I bumped my head falling off my horse.

528
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,248
Ain't shooting at us no more.

529
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:57,347
Shooting way over yonder.

530
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:01,851
What the hell's he shooting at?

531
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:04,190
Beats the hell out of me.

532
00:48:07,264 --> 00:48:09,528
Reckon we in somebody's field?

533
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,691
I didn't see nothing planted.

534
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:14,160
Shooting at us again.

535
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:21,133
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

536
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:24,042
Wait! You'll mark us!

537
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,546
Hey, Kid!

538
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:29,548
That's the Kid shooting at us?

539
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:31,550
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

540
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,156
What the hell's he shooting at us for?

541
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,553
That you?

542
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:39,728
Yeah, it's me!

543
00:48:40,164 --> 00:48:43,395
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

544
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:46,400
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

545
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:49,804
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

546
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:52,565
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

547
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,245
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

548
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,674
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

549
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:02,249
I ain't!

550
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:17,196
Chased that horse a damn mile.

551
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,929
- What was you shooting at us for?
- I thought you was following me.

552
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,833
We was. You said if I changed my mind...

553
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,703
Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

554
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:29,209
This here's Ned Logan.

555
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:32,709
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

556
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,946
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

557
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:40,616
We never talked about no other fellow.

558
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:45,554
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

559
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:49,631
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

560
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:54,633
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

561
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,139
Better than you, anyhow.

562
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:00,576
- You wasn't even coming close.
- Hands off!

563
00:50:11,155 --> 00:50:14,989
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

564
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:16,592
It ain't...bent.

565
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,652
You were shooting all over creation!

566
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,388
You'll share your half with him?

567
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,830
I figure three ways.

568
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:26,264
Wrong.

569
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:30,337
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

570
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:34,674
You going back with him?

571
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,340
He's my partner.

572
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,679
He don't go, I don't.

573
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,619
What's it come to, three ways?

574
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:41,839
Shit!

575
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:45,575
What are you pissing on about?

576
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:49,848
What are you looking at?

577
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:51,349
Looking at?

578
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:52,850
Clouds.

579
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:57,092
He's looking at them clouds on
account of we got a storm coming.

580
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,687
I seen them.

581
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:14,700
You was smart to change your mind.

582
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:20,213
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

583
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:24,378
See that hawk?

584
00:52:27,724 --> 00:52:29,453
I could hit it with one shot.

585
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:37,390
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

586
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:41,900
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

587
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:44,897
You can't see for shit, can you?

588
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,908
See your canteen?

589
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,912
How far can you see?

590
00:52:58,055 --> 00:52:59,044
Far enough.

591
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:02,419
- We ain't going to shoot canteens!
- How far? 100 yards?

592
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,651
More.

593
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:07,161
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

594
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:10,332
- He's blind, Will!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

595
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:12,257
Hold it!

596
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,664
How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?

597
00:53:16,073 --> 00:53:19,008
You bet your ass I can
see 50 yards, Will.

598
00:53:19,343 --> 00:53:22,779
I can see well enough to
shoot this son-of-a-bitch.

599
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:24,344
Hold on.

600
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,271
Hear that, Ned?

601
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:29,008
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

602
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:31,685
Jesus.

603
00:53:34,691 --> 00:53:37,956
Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

604
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:50,033
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

605
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:53,371
Did you kill all 7 of them?

606
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:55,535
Or just wing some of them?

607
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:04,113
That you here embalmed on the cover?

608
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,551
"The Duck of Death?"

609
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:10,623
The Duke.

610
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:13,059
"The Duke of Death."

611
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,836
You always were good with a
pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!

612
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:23,996
Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?

613
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:32,406
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

614
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:35,345
...liberty when depicting
the cover scene.

615
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,646
For reasons involving the marketplace.

616
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:42,416
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

617
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:47,152
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

618
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:51,160
...that the events described are
taken from eyewitness accounts.

619
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:53,369
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:54:54,037 --> 00:54:56,028
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

621
00:54:58,275 --> 00:54:59,537
The Duke.

622
00:54:59,876 --> 00:55:01,275
Duck, I says.

623
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:13,882
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...

624
00:55:14,057 --> 00:55:15,388
...said the Duck.

625
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:18,784
'You must apologize.'

626
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:21,622
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would none of it.

627
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:25,290
Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

628
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:30,133
...but the Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."

629
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:34,476
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

630
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:39,082
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

631
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:45,484
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

632
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:48,816
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

633
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:51,223
I didn't see you there...

634
00:55:51,995 --> 00:55:53,587
...nor no woman...

635
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,925
...nor two-gun shooters.

636
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,656
Nor none of this.

637
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:59,993
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there.

638
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,673
First off...

639
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:08,939
...Corky never carried two
guns, though he should have.

640
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,337
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

641
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,506
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.

642
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,011
But not because he had two pistols.

643
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,687
He had a dick that was so big...

644
00:56:18,955 --> 00:56:21,856
...it was longer than the
barrel on his Walker Colt.

645
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:25,685
The only insulting he did
was stick that thing...

646
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:29,193
...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.

647
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,760
The night Corky walked
into the Blue Bottle...

648
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:36,768
...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!

649
00:56:36,973 --> 00:56:38,770
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

650
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:43,139
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.

651
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,371
In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.

652
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,218
Meantime, Bob here...

653
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:52,650
...aims real good and
squeezes off another...

654
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,223
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!

655
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:58,225
He hits this thousand-dollar
mirror over the bar.

656
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:01,159
The Duck of Death is as good as dead...

657
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:03,991
...because Corky does it right.

658
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,301
He aims real careful.

659
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,060
No hurry...

660
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:13,407
The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...

661
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:16,068
...a failing common to that model.

662
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,073
If Corky'd had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

663
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:25,081
...he'd have defended
himself to the end.

664
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:27,022
Wait a minute.

665
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:31,823
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have...

666
00:57:32,095 --> 00:57:35,531
Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.

667
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,032
No, he just walked over
there real slow...

668
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,703
...'cause he's drunk...

669
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,098
...and shot him through the liver.

670
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:09,060
I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.

671
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,233
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

672
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:18,238
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!

673
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:22,639
You'll miss your dad-gum
roof next, I suppose.

674
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:38,324
Will?

675
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:42,928
That business up in Jackson County...

676
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,497
...that really happen?

677
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,832
The way they say it happened?

678
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:48,764
What business?

679
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:55,275
Two deputies up close pointing
their rifles right at you.

680
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:57,276
Got you dead to rights.

681
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:00,514
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

682
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:03,017
Only took a scratch yourself.

683
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:14,528
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you
shooting your way out of that scrape.

684
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:21,467
Well, I don't recollect.

685
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:26,639
You don't recollect?

686
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:28,637
Right.

687
00:59:30,547 --> 00:59:31,639
Ned...

688
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:36,475
...how many men you killed?

689
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,155
Ain't you going to answer?

690
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,491
What the hell's that to you?

691
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:53,166
I got to know what kind of fellow I'm
riding with, case we get into a scrape.

692
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,732
How many men you killed, Kid?

693
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:00,265
Five.

694
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:01,533
How many?

695
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,336
Five.

696
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,407
I done killed 5 of them.

697
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:13,522
That's including a Mexican
who come at me with a knife.

698
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:16,417
Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.

699
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:20,757
You boys're as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

700
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,860
Actually...

701
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:28,764
...Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck...

702
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:30,870
Than English Bob?

703
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,030
Faster?

704
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:33,937
Faster was his mistake.

705
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,602
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe.

706
01:00:37,781 --> 01:00:39,544
He would've killed old Bob.

707
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:46,120
Being a good shot and being
quick with a pistol...

708
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:50,790
...don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

709
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:55,292
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

710
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,460
...like as not will kill you.

711
01:00:57,634 --> 01:00:59,898
But if the other fellow is quicker...

712
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,561
Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

713
01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:03,966
Look.

714
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:11,577
That's as fast as I can draw, aim and
hit anything more than 10 feet away.

715
01:01:12,315 --> 01:01:13,976
'Less it's a barn.

716
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,575
But if he doesn't miss?

717
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:19,581
He'll kill you.

718
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,252
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

719
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:29,454
Like me.

720
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:34,262
It ain't so easy to shoot a
man if he's shooting back.

721
01:01:34,504 --> 01:01:36,495
That'll flat rattle some folks.

722
01:01:38,441 --> 01:01:40,602
- I'll show you something.
- Wait.

723
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:41,833
Look.

724
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:43,503
Take that.

725
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,014
Take it.

726
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,012
There's the key.

727
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:56,522
Just shoot me...

728
01:01:57,627 --> 01:02:01,119
...and you and Bob can ride
on out of here free as birds.
