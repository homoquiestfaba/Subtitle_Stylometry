So how are you feeling after
everything you told me today?

186
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,320
It still seems so real to me.

187
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,022
Seems?

188
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,093
Before, it was real.

189
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,998
Nobody else seems to
remember it happening.

190
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,299
I'm not sure.

191
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,170
Not being sure
is a good start.

192
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,038
When's Barney coming
in to see you?

193
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,706
This evening.

194
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,910
He's coming from work.

195
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:20,145
Well you do seem
much calmer now Angie.

196
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,981
How are you getting
on with quardraphine?

197
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,285
It makes me sleepy.

198
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,221
Okay.

199
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:30,355
I think we should stick
with it for a little longer.

200
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,292
Is that okay?

201
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,694
Do I have a choice?

202
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,263
It does seem to be working.

203
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,168
Doesn't seem so real now.

204
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,040
You've worked really,
really hard today.

205
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,709
Well done Angie, well done.

206
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,978

[button clicks]
[laptop thuds]

208
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,784
And you're confident
of the outcome?

209
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,820
Yeah, it's the
progress is a bit slow

210
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,958
but yeah she's responding okay.

211
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,192
And we're nowhere
nearer to finding out why

212
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:08,929
she never responded to
the initial treatment.

213
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,099
You're always gonna
get the exception

214
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:17,371
but overall the results
have been outstanding.

215
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,976
And have they're been
any of the cases like this?

216
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:24,876
One or two right
across the country

217
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,079
but nothing around here.

218
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:29,083
Yeah, it's good
that she's responding.

219
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:32,953
I wouldn't wanna take
more drastic action.

220
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:39,293
Well, if she doesn't
continue to respond,

221
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,828
we're just gonna
have to kill her.

222
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,366

This is your biohazard
warning system.

226
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:07,986

the following measures
come into effect.

228

of the immediately effective
nationwide quarantine

230
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,461
which has been
officially approved

231
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,330
by the United States government.

232
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:21,333
Commencing at the siren
leaving your own household,

233
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,569
even for medical
or everyday errands

234
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,470
will be a criminal offense

235
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,173
and will be punished with
state forced quarantine

236
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,008
and depending on the severity

237
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,811
of the quarantine
violation, death.

neighbors or friends

239
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,416
will be illegal
during this time.

240
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:40,218

00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,719
Mike, no, no, no, no.

366
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,654
[Mike] Please man.

367
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,221
I shot my neighbor, I shot him
so don't answer your fucking-

368
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,091
- Mike,

369
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:13,759
what you gotta stop fucking
drinking, all right?

370
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,094
Lay off the fucking weed.

371
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,195
Fuck.

372
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,297
[Mike laughs]

373
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,367
Dude listen, I don't
care if it's your sister,

374
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:25,236
your daughter, wife, I
don't give a fuck who it is.

375
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,239
Don't answer your fucking phone.

376
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:28,876
Oh fuck.

377
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,277
I'm hanging up.

378
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,713
I'm not fucking listen to this.

379
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,347
I'm not fucking
listening anymore.

380
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,716
That doesn't make any
fucking sense, Mike.

381
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:38,383
I'm a fucking
logical guy, right?

382
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,185
That doesn't make
any fucking sense.

383
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,321
Listen man, I know it
doesn't make any fucking sense,

384
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,256
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

385
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,158
[Erik] Get your fucking
self together, seriously man.

386
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,261
This is fucking bullshit, no
fucking way it can happen.

387
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,396
Come on.

388
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:51,866
Listen man, listen man.

389
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,233
I'm telling you what-

390
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:57,469

this is bullshit.

391

392
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:03,845

[water sloshes]

398
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,507
What's going on?

399
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:35,775
The fuck is going on?

402
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,295
Look I don't care about
dinner at this point, okay?

403
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:57,965
What-

404
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,367
- [Woman] No.

405
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,303
No, get the fuck away from me.

406
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,304
Oh my god.

407
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,305
[Woman] No, no, no.

408
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,543
What's going...

409
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:12,446
[Erik whimpers]

410
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:14,816

419
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,883
I just fucking

420
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,018
You motherfucker.

421
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,888

422
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,827
Mike, I don't know Mike.

423
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,462
I don't know.

424
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,831
They're coming for me.

425
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,334
I know they're coming for me.

426
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,042

427
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,911

[Erik sobbing]

435
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,028
[Erik] Why?

436
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,897
Why?

437
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,766

00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,090
I can't.

451
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:17,162
You, I'm sorry.

452
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,731
I'm can't.

453
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,934
There's no way.

454
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,801
There's no way.

455
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,604
If anyone finds this I'm
sorry I was a coward.

456
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,806
[Isabella sobs]

457
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:28,676
I'm sorry.

458
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:33,779
You can't kill
what's already dead.

459
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,850
[sniffs]

460
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:39,687
I can't go out like that.

461
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,556
I can't go out like that.

462
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:51,832
Please know I tried.
[Isabella sobs]

463
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:57,505
I tried.

464
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,143
[Isabella sobs]

465
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,181
I'm not a coward.

466
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:10,651
I'm not a coward

467
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,787
but I'm not going out like that.

468
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,156
So if anyone actually
makes it out of this

469
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:19,124
and finds this just know

470
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,660
[Isabella sobs]

471
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:22,863
I'm not coward.

472
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,669
[sobbing continues]

473
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:31,906
I'm sorry,

474
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,243
I tried.

475
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:41,046
[Isabella breaths heavily]

476
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,480

[static crackles]

479
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,787
Hey guys.

480
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,956
I just wanted to pop in here

481
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:54,526
and say hello and ask
how you're holding up.

482
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,495
It's been like three
days, I don't even know

483
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,697
but it seems like a month.

484
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:00,866
I'm so tired of being indoors.

485
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,669
I really wanna go out
and get some sun but

486
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,204
they're saying that
we probably shouldn't

487
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,672
even be going outside.

488
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,574
So this is the best I've got.

489
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:12,211
I'm like literally so pasty
for the summer it's depressing

490
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:14,013
and my dogs keep
barking at things,

491
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:15,948
I don't even know what
they're barking at.

492
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,549
It's probably like there's
too many neighbors at home

493
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,651
or something or like children.

494
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:23,655
There's like lots of kids
home now too 'cause who knows?

495
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:26,025
Do you guys have any
insight on what's going on?

496
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:29,028
If so, sound off in the
comment section below

497
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,662
and if you have any tips for me

498
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,598
on how I can get
my nice summer tan

499
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,602
while doing whatever this is
for however long we have to

500
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:40,105
or using olive oil or
any kind of like products

501
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:42,307
that I can get from
home 'cause I don't know

502
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,044
if the maid's gonna come
back and get my grocery list

503
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:46,678
and what am I
supposed to do then?

504
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,080
It's like,

505
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,248
hello how am I supposed
to fend for myself?

506
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,550
Like I just literally don't.

507
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,086
So, just let me know
what you guys are up to.

508
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:57,022
Love you all, I
miss you so much.

509
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:57,892
Bye.

510
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,562
Hey guys, I am just
popping in again.

511
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,631
Oh my videos used to
be so much more fun

512
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:08,167
this is so not fun
but Muffy and Buffy

513
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:09,768
have to go outside and potty

514
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,703
and I can't even
take them for a walk

515
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,939
and now no one has
come by to check on me,

516
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,607
it's getting really
weird out here.

517
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,143
Like normally I'd
be really excited

518
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:22,147
that I don't have people
around but the other night

519
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:24,349
there was like this
really creepy person

520
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:27,152
and they were walking around
kind of checking on things,

521
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:29,021
at least I hope they
were checking on things.

522
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:30,656
Buffy what are you doing?

523
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,693
Oh my God Buffy does not
even know what to do.

524
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:36,728
Buffy is like, we
don't poop on property.

525
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,065
Like we just don't do this.

526
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,333
We're making due
with what we have.

527
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:43,001
There's not even anybody
golfing right now

528
00:26:43,003 --> 00:26:44,136
What is happening?

529
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,004
Okay.

530
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,741
So and my pool service,
what is going on with that?

531
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,778
So like, yeah there was this
guy and he was like looking

532
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,747
over the fence and I thought
maybe he was paparazzi

533
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,883
but there was something
really weird about him.

534
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,751
Like, I don't know
if it's just the fact

535
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:01,053
that people can't get
proper nutrition right now

536
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,955
with the grocery stores overrun

537
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:06,658
but oh my God, what was
wrong with that guy?

538
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,093
And I don't even
know who to call.

539
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:10,329
Like what if he like
gets over my fence

540
00:27:10,331 --> 00:27:13,098
and like actually
sees in my windows.

541
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,201
I'm such a private person
and I just can't right now,

542
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:17,870
it's just so much.

543
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,805
[Chloe sighs]

544
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:23,408
So does anyone have any advice
for like how to build things?

545
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,279
You know, like we just board
some things up or something.

546
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,149
Buffy.

547
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,682
Oh my God.

548
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,317
My dog is like so
lost right now.

549
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,854
We usually have like people
to help us walk them.

550
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:39,758
They don't just like go outside
and potty, like savages.

551
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,194
Just crazy, crazy,
crazy stuff right now

552
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:45,032
and starting to get
really worried and

553
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,333
yeah if you guys could
just give me some insight

554
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,736
on kind of like where you're at,

555
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,139
how are you holding things up,

556
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,874
how do you make booby
traps in case, you know

557
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,910
somebody wants to look
at me take a shower

558
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,045
or something we're
so weird but you know

559
00:28:00,047 --> 00:28:01,914
people will take
advantage of hard times,

560
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:02,783
they really do.

561
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,951
Oh my God it's
getting windy now too.

562
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,719
[Chloe exclaims]

563
00:28:07,721 --> 00:28:09,721
I have no help.

564
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,190
Oh, there goes my hat.

565
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,858
Okay I guess it's
time for me to go.

566
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,992
I need both hands
to hold this hat.

567
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,394
It's a really nice hat though.

568
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,164
So, I hope you guys
are having a great day.

569
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:24,004
Okay, I normally would not
let you guys see me like this

570
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:27,775
but that guy is back again.

571
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,913
My dogs were barking like
crazy and I, [stutters]

572
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,381
I don't know.

573
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,351
I just looked out the
window and I saw him.

574
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,288
I think it's the same
guy, I don't know

575
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,922
but it looked like it,

576
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:47,861
it looked like he was
trying to like dig.

577
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:53,267
Like he was trying to
dig under my fence like,

578
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:58,939
I'm literally shaking right now

579
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:02,241
and I would normally
charge for you guys

580
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:06,445
to see me like this but I
need someone to talk to,

581
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,914
I'm getting really scared like,

582
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,382
I've heard reports earlier

583
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,518
that it had something to
do with our cell phones

584
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,525
or like our WiFi or our
fucking what was it?

585
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,793
Oh pardon me, our network.

586
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,230
Was it a network coverage?

587
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:26,965
Is it my cell provider?

588
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,501
I think it might've been my
cell provider, I don't know.

589
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,402
I was only half listening,

590
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,271
I know I should have been
more diligent with this

591
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:35,376
but I don't know what to do

592
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:42,080
and I tried to call the
police but the lines are like,

593
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,817
I'm just getting
that busy signal.

594
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:46,552
I don't know

595
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,521
and I don't really have
any friends and like,

596
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:52,558
I don't know my neighbors, so
I don't know if he needs help.

597
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,926
Am I supposed to go
out there and help him?

598
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:58,196
Like usually someone
would tell me what to do

599
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,234
and I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

600
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,268
Oh.

601
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,873
[Chloe sighs]

602
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:10,942
I am so scared, I'm starting
to get really scared

603
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,279
'cause I don't...

604
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:18,216
I don't know if maybe
I'm imagining this

605
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:22,154
or if he's really like,
what am I supposed to do?

606
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,858
I really like, I have
a lot of windows and

607
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:27,194
I don't,

608
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:30,596
I'm gonna [mumbles]

609
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,197
I'm gonna keep,
[Chloe exclaims]

610
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,332
I can't even talk.

611
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:34,933
Like I'm just so frustrated.

612
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:36,902
I'm gonna keep trying
to call the police

613
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:40,272
if somebody like
knows what to do

614
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,974
I'm such a
non-aggressive person.

615
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:45,578
I've never hurt anybody, I've
never used a weapon before.

616
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,213
I don't even own a gun.

617
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,150
I don't even own a gun.

618
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:53,287
My dogs are like really small.

619
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,258
Oh my God I should find my dogs.

620
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,060
Oh my God like,

621
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:04,098
I haven't heard them
bark for a bit like,

622
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:06,498
holy shit I gotta go, I gotta go

623
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,499
I'm so sorry.

624
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:09,434
[static crackles]

625
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:11,905
Okay what it is people don't
seem to understand out there.

626
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,873
The world has gone
totally crazy.

627
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,341
No one understands
what's going on,

628
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:18,011
no one knows what's going on.

629
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:21,346
In other countries, in foreign
countries around the world,

630
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:23,382
it's all happening.

631
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:27,520
There's a 5G signal that
literally is emitting these waves,

632
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:30,355
is turning people into zombies.

633
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:31,923
I cannot stress this enough.

634
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:33,058
It's turning people
into zombies,

635
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,494
It's giving people corona virus.

636
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,997
The virus is mutating
and creating zombies.

637
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:41,900
You can get a piece of shungite,
you can put it in water.

638
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,605
Okay put it in here, look,

639
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:51,042
if you put shungite in water,
that is gonna protect you,

640
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,011
that's going to heal
you, that's gonna stop

641
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:56,582
your body absorbing these
5G negative radiation waves

642
00:31:56,584 --> 00:31:58,917
that is pumping out
into the masses.

643
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,686
People need to understand this.

644
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:01,953
People need to understand.

645
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,922
[static crackles]

646
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,458
I swear I saw that
guy out here again.

647
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,994
I want you guys to
see him and tell me

648
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:11,531
if he looks sick or
what, what do you think?

649
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,965
Like, I just want
someone else to see him.

650
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:16,236
I know I'm not imagining
him, I know he's here.

651
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,043
God, I just saw him,
where did he go?

652
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:24,945
Fuck.

653
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,214
I just saw him.

654
00:32:38,693 --> 00:32:40,093
I just saw him.

655
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:44,965
Oh my god.

656
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,200
Wait, wait, wait I think I
see him, I think I see him.

657
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,069
He's like,

658
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:51,972
oh my god.

659
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,309
Hey what are you doing?

660
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,247
He's just standing there.

661
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:05,150
He's just, he's right
there in the bushes.

662
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,017
Do you see?

663
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:06,686
Right there.

664
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:07,589
Right there.

665
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,525
He's like right
there by that tree

666
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,729
across the way at
my neighbor's house.

667
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,668
What are you doing?

668
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,475
Oh my god, he's
just standing there.

669
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,781
Wait, wait, what?

670
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,751
Who the fuck is that now?

671
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:42,757
What?

672
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:46,226
Oh my God I think there's
someone else there.

673
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,465
There's something
wrong with her.

674
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:54,334
She,

675
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:00,140
is she, she looks like,

676
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,612
I can't tell she's
really far away but

677
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:09,114
she's walking like she's hurt.

678
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:10,284
I just...

679
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,620
What do you want?

680
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:18,358
[engine revs in background]

681
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,261
I think that guy's
coming back over here.

682
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,164
I think that guy's
coming back over here.

683
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:29,835
Oh my God.

684
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:30,705
What do I do?

685
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,406
I wish you guys could see this.

686
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,777
I want you to see
these people like,

687
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:39,246
I think there's something
wrong with them.

688
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,481
I got, I don't even...

689
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,551
[Chloe exclaims]

690
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,152
who do I call,
like what do I do?

691
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,389
Like I can't get
through to anybody.

692
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:03,603
[Chloe gasps]

693
00:35:03,605 --> 00:35:04,471
I gotta go.

694
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:08,509
Okay.

695
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,278
This might be my last video.

696
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:27,260
I think I heard
someone downstairs.

697
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:33,835
[Chloe exclaims]

698
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:41,907
I don't know, I don't
feel really good either.

699
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:43,308
[Buffy barks faintly]

700
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,177
Buffy.

701
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,747
Oh my god, I think
Buffy is out there.

702
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:48,614
Buffy.

703
00:35:48,616 --> 00:35:49,782
[door clicks]

704
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:50,652
Shit.

705
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:52,854
Buffy.

706
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:00,260
Buffy?

707
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:04,532
[Chloe retches]

708
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:11,704
Buffy, come, get in
here, get, come on no,

709
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,171
No where are you going?

710
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,472
Come back.

711
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:15,675
Come, come.

712
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:16,742
Please come.

713
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:17,610
Come in.

714
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:19,277
Hurry.

715
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,579
Buffy.

716
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:24,184
Oh my god, what the fuck?

717
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,457
[Chloe groans]

718
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,930
[Chloe exclaims]

719
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,833
What is happening?

720
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:44,269
[Chloe sobs]

721

This is Scythe000

00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:36,416
and I think this might
be my last blog post.

741
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:42,721
I keep checking the news to
see if anything's changed

742
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,793
but my Internet's failing.

is almost gone.

they told us it was gonna be.

can see that okay but

much more I can take.

get any responses

756
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,480
because I enjoyed connecting
with the world and yeah.

757
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,817
You know I'd get a thrill out of

00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,052
being a YouTuber and a vlogger

and react to everything

This is real.

to think about but

it feels like we're
seriously living

Something that's, I don't
wanna say apocalyptic

but if we as a

effects for generations.

This is not what they
told us 5G was gonna be.

771
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,867
It was supposed to simply
be using different spectrum

772

that we'd already been using
for different purposes.

773
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:41,142
Maybe different intensities,
no big deal, right?

774

to be ionizing radiation.

here than we know about

they're telling us.

even gonna see this report.

as the corona virus deaths.

that I can come to

is that somehow

00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,019
They're coming back to life.

900
00:49:13,086 --> 00:49:14,288
I know it's hard to believe

901
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,023
but that's what the fuck
is happening right now.

902
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:21,028
[panting continues]

903
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:24,597
I don't know how much
time I have left.

904
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,533
[door thuds]
[zombie growls]

905
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,570
They're fucking here.

906
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:37,311
By the looks of it I
don't have a lot of time.

907
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:40,280
My signal is weakening.

908
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:44,517
That 5G shit is
getting stronger.

909
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,488
[panting continues]

910
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:53,391
I don't know.

911
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:56,562
[panting continues]

912
00:49:56,564 --> 00:49:57,630
[door thuds]
[zombie growls]

913
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,264
Fuck.

914
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,333
They're gonna get in.

915
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,136
They're gonna get in.

916
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:05,370
Okay.

917
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:08,375
[panting continues]

918
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,579
One thing you gotta do

919
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:16,450
stay the fuck home.

920
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:20,318
Wash your fucking hands.

921
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,355
Wash your ass, whatever the
fuck it is you have to do

922
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:24,224
just do it.

923
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:28,462
[panting continues]

924
00:50:30,732 --> 00:50:34,334
Okay motherfuckers,
you'll get your chance

925
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:37,572
but I ain't going
out like no bitch.

926
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:43,410
All right.

927
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:46,480
You guys will get your chance.

928
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,553
It's time to meet old penis.

929
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:00,058
All right.

930
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,830
[panting continues]

931
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:09,200
All right.

932
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,672
You guys want some,

933
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,073
come and get it.

934
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:16,576
[zombies growl]

935
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:18,076
All right, you want some.

936
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:20,347
[gun fires]

937
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:25,317
[static crackles]

938
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,118
Hey guys it's me
Tommy from Tommy's Blog

939
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,386
I'm still here.

940
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:30,590
Don't forget to subscribe.

941
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:32,424
We need to get all
the views we can get

942
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,827
we gotta get this
news out there.

943
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,729
All right.

944
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:39,799
It's been 34 days since the
first known case in Omaha

945
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:42,768
and for me, 15 days
since I've heard

946
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,706
or seen from anybody
in my family.

947
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:47,540
At this point, I gotta believe

948
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,476
that I'm not gonna
see 'em anymore.

949
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:52,513
Alive anyway.

950
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:55,715
All right here's my day so far.

951
00:51:55,717 --> 00:51:58,450
I'm on my way back from
an unsuccessful supply run

952
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,285
and I really need to
get back to my place

953
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,155
because my phone is almost dead.

954
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:07,194
I was heading down the
street to the mini mart,

955
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:09,862
by the time I got inside there,

956
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,396
there was way too
many of them bastards

957
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:12,734
all the way around in there.

958
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,134
I was barely able
to get out of there

959
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:18,405
and back into my car before
they were all over me.

960
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:23,375
I think I've made enough
turns on my way out of there

961
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:26,277
to get rid of those with guys

962
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:30,752
but almost back to
my place now and man,

963
00:52:32,754 --> 00:52:35,188
there are a lot of those
bastards around here.

964
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:38,358
Looks like when I get there

965
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:42,528
I'm gonna have to make a
run for it into the side,

966
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,499
the front is way,
way too obvious.

967
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:52,472
Okay, here we go.

968
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,878
You guys ready?

969
00:52:57,912 --> 00:53:00,648
[ominous music]

970
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,723
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

971
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,290
Okay.

972
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:12,960
All right guys.

973
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:18,196
I am in my storm cellar,
it's not a big spot.

974
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:19,865
I'm just hoping
they didn't see me

975
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:23,736
before I was able
to get in here.

976
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,971
This is the only
place I can hold out.

977
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:27,274
Oh shit.

978
00:53:29,544 --> 00:53:30,477
Goddamn it.

979
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:33,681
I don't know if this door,

980
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:39,219
if it's gonna be
able to hold or not.

981
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,487
I don't know if I can
make it out of here people

982
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:45,390
but there's one thing
[mumbles] don't forget

983
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,995
Subscribe, get the
news out, okay?

984
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,966
We gotta do this
and I want the hits.

985
00:53:53,935 --> 00:53:56,369
Jesus I am fucked.

986
00:53:57,471 --> 00:54:00,340
[static crackles]

987
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:04,612
Hey everyone,
Fred Stevens here.

988
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:08,983
I've had it.

989
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:11,451
I've had it.

990
00:54:13,588 --> 00:54:17,357
I can't put on a good act
here for these videos.

991
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:20,325
I'm not gonna give you

992
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,862
a great entertainment
video today, okay?

993
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:24,764
I have lost everything

994
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:29,568
because of this stupid
fucking 5G bullshit

995
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:34,039
and let me tell
you, I am a vlogger,

996
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:36,509
a internet personality
kind of person

997
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:40,445
and I liked the idea
of faster speeds.

998
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:43,281
Having speeds faster
than speed of light

999
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,316
because I upload
a lot of videos.

1000
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:48,621
I do a lot of posting
on social media.

1001
00:54:48,623 --> 00:54:51,023
So I was happy at
first I thought that

1002
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:53,025
5G was gonna be a
good thing for me.

1003
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:55,393
I thought that it was gonna
help me out in the long,

1004
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:56,762
I thought I wasn't
gonna have to keep

1005
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:58,396
siting the fucking
round waiting for things

1006
00:54:58,398 --> 00:55:00,935
forever that were
slow as shit to upload

1007
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:03,769
because everybody always
wanted me to put things up

1008
00:55:03,771 --> 00:55:05,571
in for four fucking K.

1009
00:55:05,573 --> 00:55:07,338
Do you know how long it takes

1010
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,842
to upload a fucking video in 4K?

1011
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:10,876
Especially me.

1012
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:12,912
I ramble the fuck on

1013
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,047
so my videos were
pretty fucking long.

1014
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:20,054
So for 4G you know, 4K.
4G wasn't fast enough

1015
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:23,923
so I wanted 5G.

1016
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:27,092
So then I could upload faster
and I could give you guys

1017
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:31,496
my beautiful fucking face
and all its glorious details

1018
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:36,504
in 4K but you always were
up my fucking asshole.

1019
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:40,639
So yeah, I was excited about 5G.

1020
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:43,642
I didn't think 5G was gonna
scramble everyone's minds,

1021
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,377
turn people into
fucking zombies,

1022
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:49,347
turn them into fucking
crazy walking dead.

1023
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,050
Wasn't expecting that.

1024
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:52,651
Who was expecting that?

1025
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,120
Who thought that was
going to fucking happen?

1026
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:58,958
And now there's zombies
outside everywhere.

1027
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,627
Everyone, every day
more and more people

1028
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:04,364
are turned into the
walking fucking deceased

1029
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,498
and I'm sick of it.

1030
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
I can't do a fucking thing.

1031
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:11,070
I can't go anywhere.

1032
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:13,072
Yes I've got lots
and lots of movies.

1033
00:56:13,074 --> 00:56:14,073
Yes I do.

1034
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:15,610
I have lots of movies.

1035
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,010
What's fun about that?

1036
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:21,379
And what's fun when you
can feel the 5G singles,

1037
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:26,386
the five, signals getting
stronger and stronger

1038
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:29,154
and stronger and how much longer

1039
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:31,624
till I turn into a
fucking walking dead.

1040
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:34,459
How much longer till I turn
into a zombinoid zombie?

1041
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:35,460
How much longer?

1042
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:36,629
How much fucking longer?

1043
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:37,763
You know what?

1044
00:56:37,765 --> 00:56:39,430
I don't even care anymore.

1045
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:41,133
Here's the thing,
here's the thing.

1046
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:43,004
It would be much easier
for me to just go outside,

1047
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,940
leave my house and hopefully
turn into a fucking zombie

1048
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:48,807
'cause you know what?

1049
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:50,475
I'm tired of it.

1050
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:51,677
I'm fucking tired of
being in this room,

1051
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,145
I'm tired of being in here,

1052
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:55,480
I'm tired of worrying
about trying to put up

1053
00:56:55,482 --> 00:56:57,783
some kind of a video to entertain
all of you fucking idiots.

1054
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:00,485
I'm sick of it, I'm sick
and fucking tired of it.

1055
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,022
I'm sick and tired of
Karen, I don't care anymore.

1056
00:57:03,024 --> 00:57:04,723
Here's the thing, I
don't give a shit.

1057
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:06,457
I don't give a shit
what any of you do,

1058
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,661
I don't give a shit
what I do anymore.

1059
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:10,495
I don't give a shit
about making posts,

1060
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:11,630
I don't give a shit about 5G.

1061
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:13,933
All 5G did was destroy my life.

1062
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:16,467
It killed my family,
killed my brother,

1063
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,870
it killed everybody.

1064
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,605
It killed every
thing that matters.

1065
00:57:19,607 --> 00:57:21,472
I got no lady friends,

1066
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:23,542
maybe if I was in this
fucking war with a lady friend

1067
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:26,444
maybe then that would help
but nothing helps, okay?

1068
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,780
So I'm tapping off
I'm very fucking,

1069
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:29,682
I don't even wanna get in.

1070
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:30,918
I'm just gonna go out the door

1071
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:33,484
and hopefully get turned
into a fucking zombie

1072
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,621
'cause I'm tired of it.

1073
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:37,488
I don't care anymore.

1074
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:40,759
This is tiresome and
I'm not gonna perform

1075
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:43,562
for any of you fucking idiots
anymore that's the thing.

1076
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:45,864
My performances are over.

1077
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:47,933
My content is done.

1078
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,736
Find someone fucking else,
whoever else is there left

1079
00:57:50,738 --> 00:57:52,470
'cause pretty soon I'm sure

1080
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,239
even you fuckers
that are watching

1081
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,742
are gonna turn into
a fucking zombie.

1082
00:57:56,744 --> 00:58:00,813
The 5G, the 5G is
coming for you fuckers.

1083
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:04,986
So let's just, let's just
set this fucking thing up.

1084
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,786
[Fred mumbles]

1085
00:58:07,788 --> 00:58:08,723
Can you see me?

1086
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,123
Can you see the fucking door?

1087
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,725
Okay.

1088
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:14,226
All right.

1089
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:17,196
Show's over, don't need
the bowling hat anymore.

1090
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:18,132
See you guys later.

1091
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:20,599
Oh yeah, oh wait.

1092
00:58:20,601 --> 00:58:23,535
[Fred vocalizes]

1093
00:58:23,537 --> 00:58:24,939
My grand exit.

1094
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:38,919
[zombies growl]
[Fred screams]

1095
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:42,621
[static crackles]

1096
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:45,559
I went to see my dad
because I wanted to give him

1097
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:51,265
some of the shungite to
put in his house, to put,

1098
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,702
put on his WiFi

1099
00:58:57,872 --> 00:59:00,672
and when I opened
the door, walked in,

1100
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:05,679
I saw my dad and he had the
same shirt he always wears.

1101
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:12,753
He was walking into the kitchen
and I put my arm on his back

1102
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:16,023
and it was too late.

1103
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,691
He already been bitten.

1104
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:23,595
So as I reached my hand
out, he grabbed mine

1105
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:24,298
and he bit my arm.

1106
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:31,136
It was too late and it's
too late for me now as well.

1107
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:32,905
I'd just like to say
to all of you out there

1108
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:35,674
take this fucking
thing seriously.

1109
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:37,078
Please, please.

1110
00:59:38,813 --> 00:59:41,046
Use this shungite because
this can save you.

1111
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:42,815
This shungite can save
you I promise you please.

1112
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,750
It's too late for me now.

1113
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:46,251
I just hope I get to help.

1114
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:48,787
Really hope I can help
someone else out there.

1115
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:51,990
When the dead roam the streets,

1116
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:54,760
the gates of heaven
have been closed

1117
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:57,932
and a new master will
rise from the ashes.

1118
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:04,672
[static crackles]

1119
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:08,909
What's up non-believers,
it's Skeptic Steve here.

1120
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,684
A bit of an, a bit of
an unusual video today.

1121
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:25,958
As you may know we were we're
planning our next video.

1122
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,931
We were looking, we were
looking at 5G zombie stories.

1123
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,904
You've probably
seen them online.

1124
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:44,810
[Skeptic Steve chuckles]

1125
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,213
We thought it was,

1126
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,019
we thought it was just nonsense

1127
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,957
like everything else but

1128
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:06,064
so you know how we usually
do our videos, me and Brad

1129
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:08,734
we pour through research,

1130
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:12,671
we go through every secondary
source that we can find

1131
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:16,277
and we go out and we go
and see the site itself

1132
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:20,814
and so we did for this.

1133
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:25,419
We went and saw the 5G mast

1134
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:33,158
and [chuckles] as
Brad always does,

1135
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,396
he runs straight up towards it

1136
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:41,835
and immediately he was,
you know, touching it,

1137
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,737
making a point to the camera

1138
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:49,910
of how silly these people that
believe this nonsense are,

1139
01:01:57,785 --> 01:01:59,751
of course but we were fine.

1140
01:01:59,753 --> 01:02:04,693
We were fine and we
got home and nothing,

1141
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:05,960
nothing had happened.

1142
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:14,368
Then a few days later,
Brad starts getting

1143
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:19,940
aggressive, confrontational,

1144
01:02:23,944 --> 01:02:25,946
skin starts changing color

1145
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:31,216
and it's exactly like they
describe in the stories,

1146
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:33,452
it's exactly like they describe

1147
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:36,123
in all the reports that I
read from around the world

1148
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,364
and he starts,

1149
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:46,066
starts hitting me.

1150
01:02:49,203 --> 01:02:52,771
So I did what any
rational person would do

1151
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:55,841
and I picked up a hammer
that was next to me

1152
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,812
and I smashed him over
the head several times

1153
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,387
and I, I think...

1154
01:03:29,843 --> 01:03:32,844
See I went to the 5G mast too.

1155
01:03:32,846 --> 01:03:33,981
I went there too.

1156
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:40,522
[Steve chuckles]

1157
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,958
So I'm gonna start changing.

1158
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,897
[Steve chuckles]

1159
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,502
[zombies growl]

1160

[growling continues]

1161
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:09,216
Brad?

1162
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:14,421
Oh.

1163

[ominous music]

1164

[Wanderer] Fuck off you
crazy 5G zombie fucks.

1165
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:22,597
No solicitors.

1166
01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:26,534
Shit, just keep your mouth shut.

1167
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,043
It's less real if I
watch through the screen.

1168
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:56,928
Hey Justin, if you're
still out there,

1169
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,499
I've been walking
for hours today.

1170
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,101
The world has gone to shit.

1171
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:04,302
There was some kind of incident,

1172
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:07,973
this damn 5G phone network
everyone has been raving about

1173
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:12,310
has literally turned them
into raving zombie assholes.

1174
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:13,548
All over the world

1175
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:17,650
and to think we'll be
safe here in Australia,

1176
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:21,021
5G has rolled up practically
everywhere, we're fucked.

1177
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:23,955
So I figure, right?

1178
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:26,258
All the wireless phone
networks around here

1179
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,330
run through to a central
point, this tower.

1180
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:33,398
So if I could jam it somehow,

1181
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,167
I don't know it's just a theory

1182
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:37,169
but if I could shut it down,

1183
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:39,505
could it neutralize spread?

1184
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,074
Let's try and find out.

1185
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:49,082
Hey kangaroo I'm pretty
lonely, you wanna be my friend?

1186
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,954
No, fine then, see you later.

I don't know what happened here

1191
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:25,753
but I'll tell you something,
that's not cranberry sauce.

1192
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:32,224
Do you remember that
time years ago Justin,

1193
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:35,761
when we were younger,
place just like this.

1194
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:39,397
We hold up with this two
country girls, sisters,

1195
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:42,234
then their mama came
home with the shotgun.

1196
01:06:42,236 --> 01:06:44,670
Holy shit we we're
running our asses off

1197
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:48,406
and you literally cut your
ass on a barbed wire fence.

1198
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,208
We barely escaped.

1199
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,478
Good times man.

1200
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:05,525
Seems like some well powered
individuals have been here.

1201
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:08,426
A gun would be pretty
handy today, wouldn't it?

1202

come by around here.

Thanks politicians.

Look at that, beautiful,
in the middle of nowhere.

1205
01:07:17,805 --> 01:07:20,171
Look at us now discovering
beauty out and about

1206
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:23,076
because our faces aren't
glued to our phones.

face glued to his phone.

What's the chance of 5G zombies

1213
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,603
gonna pop out of here
and eat my 1G face?

1214
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:57,579
Just had to be sure anyway.

1215
01:08:03,685 --> 01:08:04,852
Fucking useless.

Nothing we guessed could
have ended up like this.

1218
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:16,361
Before corona virus was
bad, well then 5G came along

1219
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:19,132
and caused the perfect
marriage of mutation.

1220
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,400
Anyway it doesn't
matter what happened

1221
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:26,438
we all knew 5G was gonna be
bad news but no one cared.

1222
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,741
They call us conspiracy nuts.

Always conspiracy
guy on Twitter.

1224
01:08:31,278 --> 01:08:33,879
Everyone thinks
conspiracies don't exist,

1225
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:36,549
they're too far fetched unless

1226
01:08:36,551 --> 01:08:39,117
there's a politician or company,

1227
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,554
all the shits for you to
hate, then you suddenly

dots as to why the object

of your projection must
be pulling the strings

1231
01:08:49,597 --> 01:08:52,263
behind some major bad mojo.

1232
01:08:52,265 --> 01:08:54,165
Well hey bucko, try this.

1233
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:55,835
Soak your fruit in
boiling hot water

1234
01:08:55,837 --> 01:09:00,338
with vinegar mixed in and
what's the pesticides roll off.

1235
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,274
Look, if I can do this,
shut the tower down,

1236
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:05,377
things are gonna be different.

1237
01:09:05,379 --> 01:09:07,445
Let's just go back to analog.

1238
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:08,914
Analog everything.

1239
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:13,519
Analog phone, analog
news, analog movies.

1240
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,554
That means video tape.

your dating apps.

This situation look familiar?

1246
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:37,843
[ominous music]

1247
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:38,711
Can you hear it?

1248
01:09:38,713 --> 01:09:39,845
I must be close.

1249
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:41,881
It's splitting my brain open.

1250
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:43,685
It's just over this
ridge I'm sure.

1251
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:48,286
Fuck looks like a
misjudged the distance.

1252
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:51,824
Mapping up didn't work
properly and why was that?

1253
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:54,562
Not compatible with 5G.

1254
01:09:56,263 --> 01:09:59,332
Just gonna sit down
for a while, here.

1255

[zombie growls]

1256
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,277
I hear you Justin.

1257
01:10:14,982 --> 01:10:17,783
I'm sorry I couldn't
save you mate

1258
01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,719
but I'm glad you remember me.

1259
01:10:19,721 --> 01:10:22,456
[zombie growls]

1260
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,492
[static crackles]

1261
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:28,761
My name is Lucy.

1262
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,330
I have a fiance Adam

1263
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:35,400
and I'm starting
this vlog because

1264
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:38,003
it's getting pretty
bad out there now

1265
01:10:38,005 --> 01:10:40,608
and I just wanna
document our story.

1266
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:45,811
So corona virus has
been going around now

1267
01:10:45,813 --> 01:10:47,380
for the past few months

1268
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,016
and it turns out
anyone who has it

1269
01:10:51,018 --> 01:10:55,453
is more likely to "change"

1270
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:59,326
due to the "5G
waves" as they say

1271
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:03,296
and changes for the worst.

1272
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:07,802
People are essentially
turning into zombies

1273
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:12,605
and it's a freaking zombie
apocalypse going on now.

1274
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:13,473
So,

1275
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:20,646
screw staying in this
crappy rented house

1276
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:23,314
and I've been working
at a grocery store too

1277
01:11:23,316 --> 01:11:25,285
but honestly, screw that job.

1278
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:31,322
Customers just like,
no one wears masks

1279
01:11:31,324 --> 01:11:34,527
or stays six feet away and

1280
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:38,465
we just need to get away
from people, we've decided.

1281
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:44,371
So we're gonna pack up our
things, our essential things,

1282
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:49,544
we're gonna pack up
our camping equipment,

1283
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:53,981
I'm gonna pack up this dog

1284
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:02,855
and we're just gonna find
a spot probably somewhere

1285
01:12:02,857 --> 01:12:04,992
in the woods or
something, I have no idea.

1286
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:10,097
Somewhere secluded though but

1287
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:15,837
we'll camp out and see how
this all plays out I guess.

1288
01:12:16,938 --> 01:12:17,972
I'm stressed.

1289
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:23,511
Okay, we decided to pack up
my car instead of his Jeep

1290
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,080
although a Jeep would be nice.

1291
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:29,715
His car, his Jeep
is kind of fucked

1292
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:31,617
so we're just gonna take mine,

1293
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,453
I just got mine serviced.

1294
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:37,859
We just think it's better in
the long run to take mine.

1295
01:12:39,594 --> 01:12:40,893
So.

1296
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:44,495
All right, come on here we go.

1297
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:45,566
I'm coming.

1298
01:12:48,069 --> 01:12:49,737
Okay, we're on the road.

1299
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,040
They've been playing this
weird broadcast on the radio

1300
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,611
it's really creeping me out.

1301
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:01,013
[Man On Radio] Indoors at
all times until further notice.

1302
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:04,583
There is no known cure for
the virus at this time.

1303
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:05,985
[Adam coughs]

1304
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:06,986
Anyways.

1305
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:10,024
[coughing continues]

1306
01:13:11,726 --> 01:13:14,095
We're gonna head towards
North Nebraska I think.

1307
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,767
There's like a river and
some camping areas I think

1308
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:23,168
before all this happened.

1309
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,402
[coughing continues]

1310
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:26,572
Might be blocked off.

1311
01:13:26,574 --> 01:13:27,773
[coughing continues]

1312
01:13:27,775 --> 01:13:29,043
It doesn't sound good

1313
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:30,878
but

1314
01:13:32,179 --> 01:13:33,979
probably sneak
around or something.

1315
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:35,814
[coughing continues]

1316
01:13:35,816 --> 01:13:37,985
We'll break in there, we'll
find something, right?

1317
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:41,186
Yeah we'll find something.

1318
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:43,122
It'll still be fine maybe.

1319
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,123
We'll be fine.

1320
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:44,926
We'll find a good place.

1321
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:48,930
[Adam coughs]

1322
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:50,865
Okay.

1323
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:52,967
I'll update soon.

1324
01:13:57,705 --> 01:13:58,839
Let's play a game.

1325
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:01,609
A game?

1326
01:14:02,643 --> 01:14:04,143
Right now?

1327
01:14:04,145 --> 01:14:05,644
Yeah.

1328
01:14:05,646 --> 01:14:07,546
All right.

1329
01:14:07,548 --> 01:14:08,816
I just wanna take my mind
off on this for a second.

1330
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:11,116
Okay.

1331
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:14,121
Let's play I spy.

1332
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:17,656
All right.

1333
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:19,058
Okay.

1334
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:23,631
I spy with my little
something blue.

1335

1336
01:14:31,672 --> 01:14:33,539
Dang it.

1337
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:35,674
Okay, it's your turn.

1338
01:14:35,676 --> 01:14:36,644
All right.

1339
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,080
I spy something white.

1340
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:43,684
That road sign.

1341
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:48,956

1344
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:57,531
I'm fine.

1345

the spot, we'll be okay.

1346
01:15:03,838 --> 01:15:05,237
We'll be fine.

1347
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:06,574
It's your turn anyway.

1348
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:08,876
Okay.

1349
01:15:10,011 --> 01:15:12,644
Well,
[Adam coughs]

1350
01:15:12,646 --> 01:15:17,618
I spy something black and white.

1351
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:20,921
The dog.

1352
01:15:26,027 --> 01:15:27,194
Just forget it.

1353
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:34,635
Okay, we just stopped at this
park and let the dog go pee.

1354
01:15:35,703 --> 01:15:37,138
We were gonna eat something.

1355
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:41,809
I just peed by the
bush over there.

1356
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:45,846
Good thing I bought
all that toilet paper

1357
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:51,919
but anyways we're gonna
refresh, get back in the car,

1358
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:59,226
everything's fine, we're
gonna get to our camping spot.

1359
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:02,830
Okay, update soon.

1360
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:09,668
Okay,

[Adam coughs]

1363
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,075
The electronics
are all fucked up.

1364
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:17,242
[coughing continues]

1365
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:19,346
It's also effectively
locked us in.

1366
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:24,752
So, I don't know what to do now.

1367
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,689
[Lucy exhales sharply]

1368
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:32,159
It's fucking hot.

1369
01:16:33,227 --> 01:16:34,795
It's fucking hot in here.

1370
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:38,130
Can I just feel your forehead?

1371
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:40,734

1372
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:45,170
It's really hot.

1373
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:46,307
[Adam] Fuck.

1374
01:16:48,008 --> 01:16:49,141
I should sleep.

1375
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:50,943
[Lucy] Are you okay?

1376
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:52,678
I'll be fine.

1377
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,014
Just gotta sleep.

1378
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,755
Adam are you okay?

1379
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:08,963
Oh Adam, what am I gonna do?

1380
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:11,763

[Gizmo coughs]

1383
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:23,777
I apologize for my
absence as of late.

1384
01:17:25,346 --> 01:17:29,884
It's been about two
months since 5G went live.

1385
01:17:32,953 --> 01:17:35,320
About a month since
my last update.

1386
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:40,327
I've, I had to keep moving
ever since the outbreak.

1387
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:45,966
Nowhere's safe.

1388
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:53,240
I don't understand why
everyone bought the lies,

1389
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:57,709
welcomed it in, sure
corona virus sucked

1390
01:17:57,711 --> 01:17:59,912
and there were a lot
of deaths from that

1391
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:03,050
but 5G was too good to be true.

1392
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:09,156
Is a savior, high speed internet
gonna keep us connected.

1393
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:11,990
No, it's gonna kill us.

1394
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:14,293
It did kill most of us

1395
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:16,997
and those of us that were
smart enough to stay away.

1396
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:20,000
Now we're all that's left.

1397
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:22,169

every hour or so.

and I don't know why.

I don't know what
they do with us,

1403
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,724
I don't know where they take us

1404
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:47,861
but they're rounding people up.

1406
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,800
I don't know if I can do this.

1407
01:18:54,802 --> 01:18:57,504
I don't know if I can
do this on my own.

1408

1409
01:19:06,347 --> 01:19:09,116
There's so much

1410
01:19:10,985 --> 01:19:11,852
that

1411
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,390
that I had left to do.

1412
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:20,160
So many fucking things.

1413
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,431

please come for me.

1420
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:00,434
