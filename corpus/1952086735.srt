Come on, come with me in the center

53
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,143
Rose, can not go with you to
shopping. You must go home,

54
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,479
I need to fix, the family comes
in another city.

55
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:28,549
I did not need new clothes,
but you.

56
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,414
What? No, I do not.

57
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,921

00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:45,800

63
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:46,699
Yes.

64
00:06:46,734 --> 00:06:50,216
Katie, look at me. We are
point to enter the world of evil.

65
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:53,699
We are about to exit the limits
this vieþi suburban.

66
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,243
We will make serious changes,

67
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,311
from your clothes.

68
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,439
Dress like a librarian,
not sexy.

69
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:02,315
I like my clothes.

70
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:05,117
You want to exit the world your stories and your

and to join reality?

72

73
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,032

centuries

74
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,699
did not kiss him or
nor anybody.

75
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:21,332
Ryan Lambert is my soul mate.

76
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:23,867
I have to hold him.

77
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,943
We first.

78
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:33,209
I told you that if we arrive on time
will not be anyone.

79
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,853
God ... that was surprising.

80
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,996
- Who was that?
- I do not know.

81
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:51,865
But whoever it was, I think that was
my soul mate.

82
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:55,199
Ryan, playing Goldeneye lately?

83
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,696
Yes, I like guns. It is amazing.

00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,808
It was Ryan Lambert. I knew.

85
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,777
I knew that we are one fãcuþi
for another.

86
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:10,752
Even if I disgust you think that ...

87
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:14,524

which is surprising center

88
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:17,460

- It's cold.
- There are 32 degrees out.

94
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:15,916

And why? The person who wrote it

97
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,922
Let us not inquire ...

98
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,660
And we will not correct spelling
anyone!

99
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,888
- No?
- God, is trying!

100
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,405
Try really.

101
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,553
Everyone listen!
The party will not do.

184
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:31,637
Yes, you e.

185
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:35,241
Tomorrow I leave with my father
summer,

186
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,616
so that if you see ...

187
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:38,582
Tomorrow?

188
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:40,352
Do not stay for graduation?

189
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:41,284
No.

190
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:44,779
Actually my friends I wait,
so that ...

191
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:54,132
Excuse me, I ...

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,663
I'd like to know if Ryan ...

193
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,702
I always had this relationship client-guardian

194
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:08,008
and you may want to know if you
be willing to something more ...

195
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:14,310
- No you're a virgin?
- Yes.

196
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,925
Now while I had an experience

197
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,794
with a virgin, and was ...

198
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,095
Susan Enright ...

199
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,221
Yes.

200
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:25,997
Anyway ...

201
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:28,400
was too much drama and I can not.

202
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,131
But will not you be with me. I promise.

203
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,272
Frankly I'm sorry.

204
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:38,038
I did not promise that
I make sex with a virgin.

205
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,448
No virgins.

206
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:47,342
It is a shame, because ...

207
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,615
In other conditions ...

208
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,363
Hey, what did he say?

209
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,060
Not like me.

210
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,571
He said that?

211
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:08,675
He said that I do with a virgin

212
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,744
after all disaster Susan Enright.

213
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,284
Why a virgin he broke for
other in November?

214
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,216
What?

215
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,279
Katie! Hey!

216
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,591
Katie!

217
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,339
Katiekins, Katiekins.

218
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,237
Tiut and I always think ...

219
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:50,746
in one way or another, Ryan
and I will be together.

220
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,849
Now it is too late.

221
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:59,661
If in any way I could snap
of fingers

222
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:02,357
.. and ready to stop being a virgin.

223
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,097
I'm sorry.

224
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,232
Hey, haideþi to climb, and
make nonsense?

225
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:13,573
Okay, go and vomit.

226
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:20,277
I know that is a form in which

227
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:23,316
you could still have it on Ryan.

228
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,048
But you do not never.

229
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,650
Rose, I do anything.

230
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,124
All you need to do
is to lose your virginity.

231
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:42,770
But Ryan will not sleep with me.

232
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:46,275
Someone at a party in
tonight.

233
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,537
Rose!

234
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,629
You asked.

235
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,613
I think I can go.

236
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,676
- Well ...
- No!

237
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:59,288
You stay, have fun.

238
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:02,026
I need some time myself.

239
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:03,254
Okay.

240
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:08,190
Come here Katie. I love you.

241
00:19:03,488 --> 00:19:04,521
Katie!

242
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,923
Rose, I can do.

243
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,563
You can do anything to him
a chance and love.

244
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:13,997
I am so proud of you.

245
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,468
Let's get the facts ...

246
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:22,338
Who do we need to do?

247
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,076
Spencer!

248
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:25,407
No.

249
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,245
- I think not.
- Is perfect.

250
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,283
I know you are in kindergarten. It is nice.

251
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,650
It is safe.

252
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,371
And I think that it will take a minute.

253
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:38,022
I'm sorry that it took both.

254
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:41,686
Queue was ridiculously high, and
world away.

255
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:48,434
- You are well? You seem ...
- All right, Spencer.

256
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:50,401
Actually ...

257
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:54,507
Actually I said that I want to ...

258
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:55,874
I'm like what?

259
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,434
To do with you.
Let him hit it ... can penetrate.

260
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,034
In any form.

261
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:08,549
Yeah, so is Katie?

262
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:11,990
Really?

263
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:18,727
I can not let a girl escape Spencer ...
Yes or no?

264
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,664
Yes.

265
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:25,420
Yes, the final answer.

266
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,604
- Really?
- Sure.

267
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,406
I mean, sure did.

268
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:33,879
When?

269
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,848
Right now.

270
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:39,518
If not now, when?

271
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:43,756
Agreed.

272
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:48,524
Just think ... you must go to the bathroom.

273
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:53,360
I can not believe you do this.

274
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:59,629
- I can not.
- Katie, come on, sure you can.

275
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:09,116
- Better to say they look.
- Katie ...

276
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:13,519
Wait and Tita lines, no big deal.

277
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:15,723
All you need to do is, well ...

278
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,491
Nothing! Just stretch it.

279
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,928
- To lie down ...
- Spencer And you put in a ...

280
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:22,164
Spencer and I put it on ... ...

281
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,927
- His penis.
- God!

282
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,335
Spencer has a penis!

283
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,632
Rose ...

284
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:32,441
I always assume that the tiut this
but never ...

285
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:34,910
- Katie.
- Rose, I can not.

286
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:35,842
I think ...

287
00:21:36,345 --> 00:21:38,363
Do not look.

288
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,347
- Really?
- Yes!

289
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,950
But I think we need to see!

290
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,854
Should not see and can
nor have you felt.

291
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:46,820
Yes?

292
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,388
Okay, I will hurt bad.

293
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,858
I thought that I feel good.

294
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,795
Like you have some meddle in sauce
ear, how good are you to ...

295
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,694
God.

296
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:55,931
And then blood.

297
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:56,897
Blood?

298
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,600
Katie, wait lines and Tita. Oh I like you.

299
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:02,038
Maybe not the first time, and no second
and neither can the third ...

300
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:04,529
Why do I need to do this?

301
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:13,341
Well, get this. Think it over,
is as if you go to the dentist.

302
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,785
I like to go to the dentist, right?

303
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,851
Yes.

304
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:19,654
Because I have cavities

305
00:22:19,689 --> 00:22:21,623
and I always periazã dinþii.

306
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:25,061
Well, neither Spencer will not find holes,
except this.

307
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,630
You must remember that when you
when this

308
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:30,133
you have something better than
a dental brush

309
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:32,936
I'll have Ryan Lambert!

310
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,235
Yes.

311
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,534
Okay, okay.

312
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,631
Can do.

313
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,343
He and they just added ...

314
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,946
and then wait a minute or two

315
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:46,250
- And ends.
- Like going to the dentist.

316
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:47,182
Yes.

317
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:49,308
- Can!
- You can.

318
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,045
- I can!
- You can.

319
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,590
- Seriously, I can!
- You can.

320
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:58,392
Come on, go and do it.

321
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:04,934
I can not.

322
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,671
How to do this? They have încolþit me.

323
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,400
Is not correct.

324
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,438
It's too much pressure.

325
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,945
I need time to prepare me.

326
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,682
Hey, you ready for
18.

327
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,216
Yes.

328
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:22,150
Yeah, right.

329
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:24,050
I have to be okay.

330
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:26,858
I just can not come too soon.

331
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:27,824
What?

332
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:31,295
Girls take the time to ...

333
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:33,363
What?

334
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:34,330
And you know ...

335
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,099
How do you know?

336
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:38,728
Believe me, you know.

337
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,338
Just go and pull it and not
will have lasting problems.

338
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:48,741
What? No!

339
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,328
Can not do that.

340
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,377
You have another alternative.

341
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:56,113
Good.

342
00:23:59,158 --> 00:24:00,318
Here?

343
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,542
I can not believe I do.

344
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,144
Well, you must concentrate.

345
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:59,849
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Yes.

346
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:02,982
One moment.

347
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,420
I can not.

348
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,260
I need something for ...

349
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:30,807
That he left to do.

350
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:38,752
Katie ...

351
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,192
Yes.

352
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:54,490
I asked to leave, but did not want.

353
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:57,042
But not approaching this room.

354
00:25:58,446 --> 00:26:01,245
You can fill it with water?

355
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,979
Fill it in the bathroom.

356
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:18,165
God!

357
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,970
What about you? My grandfather is together.

358
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,437
I'm sorry.

359
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,132
God.

360
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:31,111
No, it is not what it seems.

361
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:34,309
Only that we did not find anything else.

362
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,242
Really?

363
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,350
I saw it.

364
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:43,789
I swear!

365
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,124
Honestly I love this thing.

366
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,632
In fact, keep.

367
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:59,038
I want to masturbate with it.

368
00:27:00,877 --> 00:27:02,310
You are a pervert.

369
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,149
And?

370
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,656
Great advice. I almost gave me
out of the party.

371
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,658
I just wanted to help.

372
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:18,159
Look what I got.

373
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,863
- What are you using?
- Believe me, making sex ...

374
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:23,230
something very hard.

375
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,558
How do you know?

376
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,129
I know it.

377
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:33,000
Okay, can do.

378
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:40,351
The best thing you can
to do is ...

379
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:42,251
to do it as soon as possible.

380
00:27:42,886 --> 00:27:43,853
Well.

381
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:53,463
Well ... I suppose ...

382
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,966
you must use your car my
the new.

383
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:37,874
Your father bought you your car
that for graduation?

384
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,771
- Yes.
- It's nice.

385
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:42,471
Thanks.

386
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:52,186
Then, I suppose ...

387
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:15,409
- First, it's more secure.
- Yes.

388
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,517
Is important.

389
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:27,450
Then I go to my place him.

390
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:39,135
Only if you want ...

391
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,398
No, thank you.

392
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,066
Well.

393
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:48,378
I do not ... you know ...

394
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:52,611
I mean that there is enormous.

395
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,644
Okay.

396
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:58,323
Actually, that's probably good.

397
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:01,017
It's your right.

398
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,648
I mean that's not small.

399
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,098
It is only normal. 15.8 cm.

400
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:15,441
That if a measure of peak
not the basis.

401
00:30:15,476 --> 00:30:18,138
He's one of the most measured,
I think that is a way to tri and a.

402
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:21,542
I mean ... perhaps.

403
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,501
Well ...

404
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:25,384
Well.

405
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,049
Then ...

406
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:31,616
You are ready?

407
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:34,320
Yes.

408
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:43,836
I let you back.

409
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:00,110
God.

410
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,953
A to fire some fireworks
fireworks.

411
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:09,989
Go!

412
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,629
What the hell is going on with this shit?

413
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:19,102
Okay, just ...

414
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,066
You are okay?

415
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,845
Yeah, just that ...

416
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,078
Spencer Yeah, come on!

417
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:31,652
I know you?

418
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:32,820
No.

419
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:34,120
It was weird.

420
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:38,893
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,896
I do not knew that you do.

422
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:42,423
Frankly I'm sorry.

423
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:49,339
I think we should go for
external interference ...

424
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,068
with kissing.

425
00:31:53,209 --> 00:31:54,105
Well.

426
00:31:55,044 --> 00:31:56,204
Great.

427
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:58,581
Just wait.

428
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:04,312
- Damn.
- What? What happens?

429
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:07,416
- I did something?
- No, it's good.

430
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:08,821
Okay?

431
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,159
- Close your eyes, right?
- I agree.

432
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,094
Spencer ...

433
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,542
- You can quickly insert?
- Yes.

434
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,641
You need only to focus.

435
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,114
Okay, now.

436
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,623
What? What are you doing?

437
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,989
Get away!

438
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,259
Damn, she înþepenit!

439
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:49,094
Think you are on another woman

440
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,137
with a great ass while I
penetrate?

441
00:32:52,172 --> 00:32:55,106
- No one does.
- No.

442
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,273
Katie, wait.

443
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,006
Please, Katie!

444
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,513
I know that most are not nice
of school

445
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,684
But you need help
vision to penetrate me?

446
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,951
I imagine that you're a
woman with big ass?

447
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,889
No, Katie, I imagine that you are.

448
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,584
Has no meaning.

449
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,059
Just watch.

450
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,823
I can find someone else.

451
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,563
Anyone else?

452
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,603
To do, slut.

453
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,230
One, two ...

454
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,636
Good luck, fucker!

455
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,366
Katie, how you went?

456
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:39,952
No, not function.

457
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:41,112
Very drunk?

458
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,920
Not only are you not like him.

459
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,325
God!

460
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,695
Spencer is gay!
I always tiut and that.

461
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,031
It was in sight all the time.

462
00:33:57,837 --> 00:33:59,600
Do not you was up because of beer?

463
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,271
You could not?

464
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,303
No.

465
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:13,920
You just can 't explain.

466
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,686
Hold.

467
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:25,399
Please urinaþi in the bathroom.

468
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:26,331
Hey ...

469
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,864
Take, relax.

470
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:34,901
Damn! Cheers.

471
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,904
Up your ass!

472
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:49,917
I do not know, Rose. Maybe we can
go home.

473
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:52,950
What?

474
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:54,293
No.

475
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,646
I had only a small contretemps.

476
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:57,257
May have to find someone

477
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,666
and skip the dentist sexy!

478
00:35:02,403 --> 00:35:05,497
And if me sui a horse

479
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,575

480
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,847
and water has a big butt ..

481
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:14,480
Okay, that's fine.

482
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,983
Not understand anything. You are drunk.

483
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:18,349
Katie ...

484
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,791
Tonight I lose virginity.

485
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:28,962
This virgin bitch.

486
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:31,066
The wait to find Chelsea.

487
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:31,998
Chelsea!

488
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:48,684
Very good, a little contretemps.

489
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,049
You get reorganized.

490
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,215
Sweater flies.

491
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:56,054
You know, I never thought I would be so difficult.

492
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:58,827
It happens.

493
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,494
Katie, you're here?

494
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:02,463
I sign annual album?

495
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:04,867
I'm going to join the group
the dialogue and debate, for

496
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:06,926
And a head next year.

497
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:10,373
Everything you need is a
female model on which to follow him

498
00:36:10,408 --> 00:36:12,671
and happens to be one up.

499
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:19,513
My model is followed?

500
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:21,581
Yes.

501
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:25,388
Look good, because that is what
and what do you want a man.

502
00:36:25,423 --> 00:36:27,754
That is what they want and the one
man?

503
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,159
Well.

504
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:33,085
Let's see what it is.

505
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:35,859
You did that?

506
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:38,868
No.

507
00:36:39,903 --> 00:36:41,097
Good?

508
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:45,337
Mandy said that before and to make
48D implants

509
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:48,300
regular and switch to fill and bra

510
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,111
with chicken cutlet.

511
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,150
But we have such a thing.

512
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:58,417
But can not find something that
to be useful.

513
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:00,484
Plan:

514
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:03,926
I can look in the refrigerator

515
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:06,623
and you go and you makeup
more

516
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:10,432
combs and I laugh at you.

517
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:13,070
- But I laughed the morning.
- The legs do not.

518
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,470
And chestiuþa you, right?

519
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:20,978
You said that it is an emergency. Why are
a razor?

520
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:23,412
Shave emergency. Health.

521
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,983
Is not so bad.

522
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:39,525
It feels good. 

523
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:47,899
It was locked.

524
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:55,566
Chicken ... chicken ... chicken.

525
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,640
We got something. Super.

526
00:39:08,922 --> 00:39:11,117
Finally it's a little bit.

527
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:27,598
You are man. You can rub one out.

528
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,502
Not clean.

529
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:36,049
You are very lucky.

530
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,314
They take me everywhere.
You are ready?

531
00:39:41,823 --> 00:39:43,484
Take it off.

532
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,664
Mommy has care, right?

533
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:57,929
Yes, I eat.

534
00:39:58,139 --> 00:39:59,128
Really?

535
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,391
Well, the mind controls matter.

536
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:02,802
Do it, please. And now put your stuff.

537
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:06,512
But it is chicken.

538
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,214
Do not be so sensitive, okay?

539
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,385
Want big breasts or not?

540
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,351
Marina?

541
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:12,945
Is what I found, right?

542
00:40:17,092 --> 00:40:18,889
Ask them, I a.

543
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,589
Extraordinary!

544
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,470
For me, it works.

545
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,203
Hey, do not get.

546
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:23,691
What do?

547
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:26,463
Want to get and to make a
and private session?

548
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:27,595
What are you doing?

549
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,032
Chelsea told me that you planned
you lose your ...

550
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:30,260
Busy!

551
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,167
No, Wait.

552
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:34,136
- You can do this.
- And why not?

553
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,901
If you can not with her, does not mean
that no one can.

554
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:59,463
Ia. You are Kathy, right?

555
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:00,395
Katie.

556
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:02,699
Yes.

557
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,259

To go in camera.

00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,970
Will happen at any time.

579
00:43:13,005 --> 00:43:15,633
Okay, I can tell you that you see
a penis, right?

580
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:17,767
Yeah, you know.

581
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:23,316
You're right. This time

582
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,806
And you should ...

583
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:27,802
Just try.

584
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,953
Just need to do, right?

585
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:32,825
Petardele you tried?

586
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,162
Hey, excuse me, are you ready?

587
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:37,064
- Come on.
- Goodbye.

588
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:38,292
Goodbye.

589
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:43,300
God, give it off.

590
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:48,709
Will be fine. You are so cool.

591
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:49,971
Yes?

592
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:51,942
Is there ...

593
00:43:53,347 --> 00:43:57,113
form to make love
or sex?

594
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:01,883
Look, I like French.

595
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,890
Sure, we can not do sex.

596
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:08,690
But first you must want to suck.

597
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:12,099
It will be very good. You are ready?

598
00:44:12,134 --> 00:44:13,293
God, come on.

599
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,363
Come on.

600
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,568
What happens? What?

601
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:21,902
Nothing, just ...

602
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,812
All you show?

603
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:26,245
No way!

604
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,477
Some are ugly.

605
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,783
Come on, you can sãruþi.

606
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:33,688
I have to answer the phone.

607
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:35,521
I heard you calling.

608
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:38,057
And answer me back in a minute.

609
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,362
It will not be ready all day
and not talk to me.

610
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:42,420
Just a second.

611
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,964
I have not heard to call.

612
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,337
What happened?
It is assumed that you have to be in.

613
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:51,606
Tell me if you need to show you a.

614
00:44:51,641 --> 00:44:53,335
Yes, more or less.

615
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,340
You are sure?

616
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,239
Forget you.

617
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:00,078
I am a lesbian.

618
00:45:00,215 --> 00:45:01,515
No you're lesbian.

619
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,419
You need only to regular and nuiele you.

620
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:04,554
Looks like a wild mushroom.

621
00:45:05,689 --> 00:45:07,521
That has veins.

622
00:45:07,556 --> 00:45:10,926
And it is purple.
And I want to put your mouth on it.

623
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,095
- When to come ...
- To come?

624
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,862
Launch sperm.

625
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:17,266
I can, really can not.
You must go.

626
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:19,166
- Katie!
- I can not.

627
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,402
All these are like a movie
horror.

628
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:24,940
And do not even like
mushrooms.

629
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:28,034
Trevor! Where are you?

630
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,878
Kathy, you came back.

631
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:39,220
Katie.

632
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:41,018
What happens? You seem nervous.

633
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:42,390
Come on.

634
00:45:42,425 --> 00:45:44,627
Let gu are a bit of that ...

635
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:46,526
you felt better.

636
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:48,390
- Yes?
- Yes. Course.

637
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,368
Shoot, so, okay.

638
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:02,235
Now it's time to make you fly.

639
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:05,341
Well. I just need ...

640
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:08,301
to suck a little one minutes

641
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:10,787
and then we can do sex.

642
00:46:10,822 --> 00:46:12,277
Okay?

643
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:15,792
I do not think you can. I want to vomit.

644
00:46:15,827 --> 00:46:18,462
Katie relax.

645
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:19,662
What?

646
00:46:19,697 --> 00:46:21,197
I did not say anything.

647
00:46:21,232 --> 00:46:23,996
Katie, yes, closer-up.

648
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:26,252
Katie Yes, yes.

649
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,137
Mr Mushrooms?

650
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:30,975
Yes Katie, love. Now kiss me.

651
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,907
No.

652
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:35,361
Katie, please, is for your sake.

653
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:38,881
You know why men do not look at you?

654
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:44,214
Because of the lack of "do not know what"
that have experience with women.

655
00:46:44,855 --> 00:46:45,913
Yes.

656
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:50,561
Katie, listen to me. Men are
some wrap and empty sites.

657
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:52,595
Mind, brain.

658
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,267
Soul men is here.
Yes, penis.

659
00:46:58,022 --> 00:46:59,636

00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:02,969
So I Katie, you must

661
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:06,268
Yes Katie, it sucks.

662
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:09,605
You are here Trevor?

663
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:13,151
- It's my friend!
- I thought I did not have friends.

664
00:47:13,186 --> 00:47:16,382
- Trevor, I can get!
- Okay!

665
00:47:18,223 --> 00:47:20,384
There you are!

666
00:47:21,626 --> 00:47:23,126
Well.

667
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:26,031
Do not you do that if I would
in your place.

668
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:29,000
Ta thing smells like cherries and a.

669
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:31,735
Yes.

670
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,863
Okay, okay.

671
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:40,511
Katie, hey.

672
00:47:40,546 --> 00:47:43,181
- What happened?
- I want to talk about it.

673
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:47,153
Rose, the whole thing with the sex
was more annoying than me waiting.

674
00:47:47,188 --> 00:47:49,622
I will be happy if I have to
see a penis again.

675
00:47:49,657 --> 00:47:52,190
Just that you have not found that indicated.

676
00:47:52,225 --> 00:47:54,927
When you see Ryan's,
will be gratified.

677
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:57,028
Rose, I do not think ...

678
00:47:57,063 --> 00:47:59,361
I'm sorry Rose, I'm sorry virgino.

679
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:02,802
And what's worse to be a virgin?

680
00:48:02,837 --> 00:48:03,734
Nothing!

681
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,738
I'm sick of you and form
stupid to tell me.

682
00:48:07,073 --> 00:48:08,935
I am president of the club ah!

683
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:10,798
I am the captain of the debate!

684
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:12,667
And best of class!

685
00:48:13,446 --> 00:48:14,378
Almost.

686
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:15,477
Yes.

687
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:19,151
Can I do this.

688
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:22,556
Can I do if I proposed.

689
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:23,420
Yes!

690
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:26,419
Rose, I will end with this ...

691
00:48:26,627 --> 00:48:27,593
quickly.

692
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:29,789
Wonderful. Very good.

693
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,382
Well, him.

694
00:48:56,089 --> 00:48:58,692
Cisco? Is completely gay.

695
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,296
No, it is surprising to bed.

696
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:03,423
He has a great tool.

697
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,200
What color is it?

698
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:21,214
Hey Cisco ...

699
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,218
It is a rumor that you do
in a way surprising.

700
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,209
- Katie wants to persuade.
- Rose!

701
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,488
No, it is true, but ...

702
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:30,690
for me means not only
to have sex.

703
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:34,195
Is to use my sexual energy
forces to release "Cunnilingi"

704
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:37,832
and to unite with this energy
energy that our bodies emit.

705
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:41,098
Dad! And why not give it to Katie
a lecþie?

706
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,640
Normally I do not lose time
girls with no experience

707
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:46,904
but can be very interesting.

708
00:50:10,699 --> 00:50:13,293
God once again!

709
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:16,570
- You are a real bitch.
- It is not.

710
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:20,175
Maybe we should call it to
I feel really.

711
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,010
Yeah, totally.

712
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:25,081
You should say that it felt
it is

713
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,447
a true bitch!

714
00:50:28,518 --> 00:50:31,578
The train leaves the staþie love.
All aboard!

715
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:34,351
That is perfect.

716
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:37,326
Feel the power.

717
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,264
Get your body to release
and your spirit ...

718
00:50:43,867 --> 00:50:46,529
I can run through the veins.

719
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:54,944
Feel good and do not forget to breathe.

720
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:56,070
Respiraþia is important.

721
00:50:56,813 --> 00:50:59,680
Let down your clothes and go to bed with me.

722
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:27,845
Come here.

723
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,869
Yes.

724
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,142
Cari move slow.

725
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:39,416
In and out.

726
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:43,623
Your body to be a recipient
for love.

727
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,954
Now to begin,

728
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:49,933

729
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:54,302

00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:03,271
What is the name of Yoni yours?

732
00:52:04,015 --> 00:52:05,215
Yoni mine?

733
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,582
Listen, why not ask?

734
00:52:11,923 --> 00:52:13,256
Yoni ...

735
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:16,055
How you name?

736
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:23,336
I said nothing.

737
00:52:23,371 --> 00:52:24,234
Breathe.

738
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,632
Now ask her.

739
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:36,877
Yoni ... how do you name?

740
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:48,887
Says that her name is Joni.

741
00:52:50,296 --> 00:52:51,763
Joni.

742
00:52:52,064 --> 00:52:53,030
Joni!

743
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:55,659
His name is Yoni Joni yours?

744
00:52:56,903 --> 00:53:00,173
You know Katie, I thought that is something
particular, that you are you can better

745
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,275
but not take it seriously.

746
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,208
What?

747
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:05,645
I can not reveal if I learn.

748
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,113
No, I just think it only ...

749
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:11,743
is nervous, and make bad jokes
when angry.

750
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:14,750
Tell them you're sorry.

751
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:23,446
Okay, you convinced me.

752
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,130
We start with the cow?

753
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:27,148
No, I like my colon.

754
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:29,131
Muy bien, wheelbarrow.

755
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:33,023
Well.

756
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:34,317
Plate.

757
00:53:34,352 --> 00:53:35,430
Pizza?

758
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,508
I a.

759
00:53:38,979 --> 00:53:40,071
Well.

760
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:56,846
Cisco, I quickly put it?

761
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:59,463
No need to do this?

762
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:03,633
I feel the energy when passing

763
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:06,498
Lingum from the Yoni.

764
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:20,519
Excuse me.

765
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:24,219
I wonder how long you can do that.

766
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:28,194
Well, once took ten hours.

767
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:32,267
I have for ten hours. I have a deadline.

768
00:54:34,303 --> 00:54:35,634
I love you.

769
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:40,164
I always loved.
I'm always thinking about you.

770
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:41,576
And i. ..

771
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,204
just love you.

772
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,017
No, I was ...

773
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:52,154
No, it is okay.

774
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,849
Is love.

775
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:57,358
Love is sweet.

776
00:54:57,393 --> 00:54:59,345
It is a perfect union, and it is beautiful.

777
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:03,565
Well. It is available.

778
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,532
No, what?

779
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:08,162
You can be my grandfather. You can
I buy gifts for Christmas.

780
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,831
I want a Playstation 3.

781
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,002
Katie.

782
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,448
- You did it?
- No! He wanted to do 10 hours.

783
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,115
Hey.

784
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,389
I do not worry.

785
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:27,321
I have a plan.

786
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,304
Katie.

787
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:30,384
Here you are.

788
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,657
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, Spencer.

789
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,198
Please let me out.

790
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,329
Katie.

791
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,809
But what, what you did on the exam
chemistry final?

792
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:51,847
I passed.

793
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,476
Rose, please, let me out.

794
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,727
I know that we can help with that,
if you want?

795
00:56:02,762 --> 00:56:05,261
No, I'm sorry. There was ...

796
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:09,000
Girls, concentraþi sure.
Either stay here or leave.

797
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,901
Katie, please stay with us.

798
00:56:10,936 --> 00:56:13,170
We'll be more fun.

799
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:14,137
Yes.

800
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,438
You mean we do sex?

801
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:18,899
Yes.

802
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,444
That can work.

803
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,248
I suppose that we must present.

804
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:25,180
I'm Katie.

805
00:56:56,181 --> 00:56:58,172
I do not think a lesbian.

806
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:05,823
God! What is this?

807
00:57:07,627 --> 00:57:08,958
I don 't want.

808
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:13,464
Well, Katie is the faeces.

809
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:04,149
It fits!

810
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,618
No, wait! It's mine!

811
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:26,969
It's okay. Not I
worry.

812
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:35,014
You over?

813
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:37,984
No. It was the fourth time in an hour.

814
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:41,287
You must go, then.

815
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:07,182
Great. My father will reach about
in half an hour

816
00:59:07,217 --> 00:59:08,115
so you have time.

817
00:59:08,217 --> 00:59:09,149
Come on.

818
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,011
Half an hour?

819
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:17,524
Hey ...

820
00:59:19,094 --> 00:59:20,895
I know you are on Todd.

821
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,626
I think it was in our school,
but I did not see any.

822
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,258
We?

823
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:32,238
- I do not know what to do with it.
- Love you and me.

824
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:34,275
Make me your bitch, right?

825
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,378
I promise you that after a fire.

826
00:59:36,413 --> 00:59:38,380
But now I need it.

827
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:40,347
You were at our school?

828
00:59:40,616 --> 00:59:42,718
No, my sister was.

829
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:43,912
Love you me.

830
00:59:45,588 --> 00:59:46,452
Well.

831
00:59:47,223 --> 00:59:49,419
You are my bitch.

832
00:59:50,126 --> 00:59:53,230
I'm sorry, do not even know
what to say.

833
00:59:53,265 --> 00:59:56,333
Say what you want, only to be filthy

834
00:59:56,368 --> 00:59:58,265
Maltrateazã me, ugly.

835
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,162
Modificatoarele mixture.

836
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:06,876
There are better uses modificatoarele.
As in, "said an ugly"

837
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:09,477
or you love me hard. "

838
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:11,646
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

839
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:15,139
Who cares? I'm sick of people

840
01:00:15,285 --> 01:00:18,054
not interested to talk
good English.

841
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:21,285
The first time Rose and penis and
now you!

842
01:00:22,926 --> 01:00:28,364
Do not you understand English correctly
is the civilized society?

843
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:30,600
Yes, Mrs. teacher.

844
01:00:30,635 --> 01:00:33,437
I so tepþi to triumph without
you know grammar?

845
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:34,772
- Yes.
- Really?

846
01:00:36,073 --> 01:00:39,907
How will you observe if you
English words are correct?

847
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:44,615
I love you and your brain,
goes astray.

848
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,244
You did it again. I hit the brain?

849
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:49,352
No.

850
01:00:49,387 --> 01:00:51,254
So tell correctly.

851
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:54,225
When I love you, my brain
goes astray.

852
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,351
Accurate.

853
01:00:56,894 --> 01:00:59,795
I have to use it to
My lecþiile private.

854
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:03,301
I'm sorry, Miss, I was
a very bad boy

855
01:01:03,336 --> 01:01:05,320
and must be punished.

856
01:01:05,355 --> 01:01:07,270
Now you can hit me?

857
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:10,867
You have a penis, so you hit me too.

858
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:16,538
Speaking of changes ...

859
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:19,049
Someone coming!

860
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,861
Haideþi children out.

861
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:30,793
Out!

862
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:37,769
What the hell?

863
01:01:39,538 --> 01:01:42,674
I do not think you deserve the award for
best citizen

864
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:45,006
because today was a slut here.

865
01:01:46,211 --> 01:01:47,405
Katie.

866
01:01:49,214 --> 01:01:50,341
God.

867
01:01:53,386 --> 01:01:55,488
Seth needs to see this.

868
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:56,580
Seth!

869
01:01:58,858 --> 01:01:59,955
Katie!

870
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,053
Jeremy

871
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:11,287
I love you.

872
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:12,898
You are beautiful.

873
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:14,687
Figure ta ...

874
01:02:14,722 --> 01:02:16,497
and tai breasts.

875
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,273
Your penis.

876
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:21,781
Katie, I never told you
I have a big penis.

877
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:22,833
Not so!

878
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:24,172
God.

879
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,477
It is a big penis!

880
01:02:26,953 --> 01:02:28,978
Where?

881
01:02:35,996 --> 01:02:38,055
How did I forget?

882
01:02:45,406 --> 01:02:47,374
Yes, crabs.

883
01:02:52,713 --> 01:02:54,010
It ... yes.

884
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:07,156
It's good.

885
01:03:11,466 --> 01:03:13,491
How crazy!

886
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:19,639
Film. No! You stop it!

887
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:20,606
What are you doing? Please do not shoot.

888
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:23,235
Please, stop it up.

889
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:24,944
No go.

890
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:27,345
We can transform you into a star.

891
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:30,344
What are you talking?

892
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:34,083
10.85 bucks for a porno film.

893
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:37,184
That's a lot.

894
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:48,519
Take care, leave.

895
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:49,869
Do not be stupid Seth.

896
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:52,608
Look, give me the tape.
I have to pay for it.

897
01:03:52,643 --> 01:03:54,608
Under any circumstances.

898
01:03:54,643 --> 01:03:58,514
Why do this? Wanted to do
serious stuff.

899
01:03:58,549 --> 01:04:00,846
It's fun. And then not

900
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:03,976
scandals here, or yes?

901
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,250
Spencer! Your fault.

902
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,026
I know.

903
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:28,274
Katie ...

904
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:29,305
Hey.

905
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:33,282
Here you are.

906
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,651
You are okay?

907
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:42,790
Katie ...

908
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,256
Nothing. No one and will
remembers nothing morning.

909
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,436
Well, it is something that will
all talk

910
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:56,673
all the time, and why? Who cares?

911
01:04:56,708 --> 01:04:58,773
However, all are bad.

912
01:04:58,808 --> 01:05:02,437
Now that you're so close
not applicable to renunþi.

913
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:04,713
What?

914
01:05:04,748 --> 01:05:08,741
Yes. Had to renunþ three hours.

915
01:05:09,185 --> 01:05:10,777
I can not do this.

916
01:05:11,755 --> 01:05:15,385
That was the ugliest night
of my life.

917
01:05:17,094 --> 01:05:19,562
You saw what happened there?

918
01:05:20,731 --> 01:05:22,358
Yeah, I heard.

919
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,436
Not only that.

920
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:27,927
Everything! Everything!

921
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:32,433
What I?

922
01:05:34,912 --> 01:05:37,014
Yet we can go back and to
to make this happen.

923
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:40,708
No, we can.

924
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:44,811
I do not want something you never.

925
01:05:45,556 --> 01:05:48,859
I have to wait until we can reach
40 years to lose my virginity,

926
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:49,917
if necessary.

927
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:52,529
Rose ...

928
01:05:52,964 --> 01:05:56,230
Thanks a lot for everything
your help, but ...

929
01:05:57,035 --> 01:06:00,527
I think it's time to go.

930
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:04,534
And Ryan?

931
01:06:05,077 --> 01:06:06,772
I do not know.

932
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,807
Katie ...

933
01:06:12,651 --> 01:06:13,845
Damn.

934
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:22,394
Spencer Really, you think that Katie deserves
award for the best citizen?

935
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:23,493
No ...

936
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:26,622
I mean ... No, it does not.

937
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:34,034
It is my fault. What I did before,
she makes it.

938
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:37,310
Think about that and they lose
virginity?

939
01:06:37,345 --> 01:06:40,143
I do not like to sleep with Ryan Lambert.

940
01:06:40,813 --> 01:06:44,146
And everyone and you do not think Ryan
would not do it with a virgin.

941
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,740
What? No!

942
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:52,917
-Where did you hear that?
- We all know ...

943
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,950
less you.

944
01:06:57,463 --> 01:06:58,657
Damn.

945
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:01,360
I'm so stupid.

946
01:07:02,702 --> 01:07:05,637
Of course it is for Ryan.
Always was and a.

947
01:07:07,473 --> 01:07:10,567
I knew. I knew that Ryan was the soul
My pair.

948
01:07:10,677 --> 01:07:12,577
Kiss That proved it.

949
01:07:14,481 --> 01:07:16,779
He will be the first.

950
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:19,210
Let's go after some punch.

951
01:07:19,853 --> 01:07:22,788
- Spencer, are you okay?
- Yes.

952
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:24,986
Spencer ...

953
01:07:28,328 --> 01:07:32,196
If you want to go back to her,
know good shape.

954
01:07:34,334 --> 01:07:35,392
What?

955
01:07:36,704 --> 01:07:40,902
Just fudge the votes in my favor

956
01:07:41,742 --> 01:07:44,108
and I have to do what you want.

957
01:07:45,446 --> 01:07:46,674
Whatever.

958
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:50,076
And nobody should want to tie.

959
01:08:13,475 --> 01:08:15,306
Shit ... Katie?

960
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:19,114
I'm sorry, I only came
after my bag.

961
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:20,780
Why are you naked?

962
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:24,080

I have puke on me.

963
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,449
- Where you going?
- I'm going after my bag.

964
01:08:30,091 --> 01:08:33,424
Do not go home. I want to do it now.

965
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:39,900
We do now.

966
01:08:39,935 --> 01:08:41,994
But you said ...

967
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:47,036
I've said before and, not forget.

968
01:08:48,577 --> 01:08:49,669
What?

969
01:08:51,714 --> 01:08:53,272
Nice tits, Katie.

970
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:56,007
- What þâþe beautiful.
- Ryan.

971
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:03,451
Ryan.

972
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:09,920
I always thought at the time
this.

973
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:12,726
Yeah, and me.

974
01:09:14,703 --> 01:09:18,504
A quick felaþie.

975
01:09:20,043 --> 01:09:23,137
- Yes, it's good.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

976
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,110
Well.

977
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:30,075
- I need the bathroom.
- Sure.

978
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:41,322
If we abandon an island

979
01:09:42,165 --> 01:09:44,099
I have no problems with it.

980
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:47,401
- Really?
- You are a good boy.

981
01:11:06,518 --> 01:11:07,815
I came back.

982
01:11:10,355 --> 01:11:12,122
Not understand.

983
01:11:12,157 --> 01:11:14,182
Chelsea and everybody.

984
01:11:17,129 --> 01:11:21,965
Ryan, I'm sorry, not even
I do not like it.

985
01:11:24,938 --> 01:11:26,633
Well, Friday.

986
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:30,434
Where were we? A blow job.

987
01:11:34,347 --> 01:11:37,050
Today was the most crazy night
of my life.

988
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:41,146
I swear. I do not know what it could
happen.

989
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,227
Shit.

990
01:11:48,795 --> 01:11:51,264
Heart monitor is the grandfather.

991
01:11:51,299 --> 01:11:53,596
Damn, sunaþi 911.

992
01:12:08,082 --> 01:12:09,947
God, what the hell!

993
01:12:12,586 --> 01:12:14,952
I suck her grandfather.

994
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:21,286
Kill him!

995
01:12:23,364 --> 01:12:24,956
God!

996
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:44,551
God!

997
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:03,136
Katie, you came back.

998
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:06,504
You must go. I need
my bag.

999
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:09,444
What happens? Where were we?

1000
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:11,346
Only ... it's time.

1001
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:12,274
No.

1002
01:13:12,547 --> 01:13:13,775
What happens?

1003
01:13:14,482 --> 01:13:16,418
May I not love you?

1004
01:13:16,453 --> 01:13:17,836
Yes, sure.

1005
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:19,220
Just ...

1006
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:22,391
Make love to me now.

1007
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:23,323
Now.

1008
01:13:43,112 --> 01:13:44,863
Ryan ... Ryan.

1009
01:13:44,898 --> 01:13:46,615
What happens?

1010
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,310
I do not know.

1011
01:13:49,618 --> 01:13:51,347
I do not know.

1012
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:55,113
I'm sorry. I thought that would
be different.

1013
01:13:55,825 --> 01:13:57,793
That that kiss.

1014
01:13:57,828 --> 01:13:58,726
Kiss?

1015
01:13:58,761 --> 01:14:00,864
That kiss of class and ASEA.

1016
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,929
It was surprising.

1017
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:04,960
So passionate.

1018
01:14:06,203 --> 01:14:08,728
Mean that we will be together
forever.

1019
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,072
I do not remember.

1020
01:14:19,049 --> 01:14:20,346
I'm sorry.

1021
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:24,153
You must go.

1022
01:14:26,189 --> 01:14:27,213
Goodbye Ryan.

1023
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:31,226
Goodbye, Katie. Have a nice summer.

1024
01:14:44,275 --> 01:14:46,869
My bag.

1025
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:02,226
You are gay?

1026
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:04,427
No ... yes.

1027
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:06,397
Well, technically are bisexual.

1028
01:15:06,432 --> 01:15:07,659
You are gay.

1029
01:15:10,568 --> 01:15:14,129
Forgive me for not told you. I
to know all.

1030
01:15:14,572 --> 01:15:16,256
Ryan, I would not tell anyone.

1031
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,180
Damn. Hey, you have to say
anyone, right?

1032
01:15:24,683 --> 01:15:26,412
Katie, Katie!

1033
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:42,522
Rose, I am. Are out in front.

1034
01:15:44,102 --> 01:15:46,002
I need a minute.

1035
01:15:49,107 --> 01:15:51,871
To be two.

1036
01:16:03,423 --> 01:16:04,989
Here you are.

1037
01:16:05,024 --> 01:16:08,094
- You must speak with you.
- Hi Spencer.

1038
01:16:08,129 --> 01:16:09,460
Katie, listen.

1039
01:16:09,495 --> 01:16:12,130
I should not say. I know.

1040
01:16:12,165 --> 01:16:15,001
I behaved like a madman
tonight.

1041
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,402
Yes, but ...

1042
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:19,200
All the shit that I did!

1043
01:16:19,672 --> 01:16:22,368
I can not believe I've killed
bãtrânelul on that.

1044
01:16:24,744 --> 01:16:26,244
It was very bad.

1045
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:29,942
Yesterday I was not upset about that
I was the best in class.

1046
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:33,410
Not even we appreciated what we had.

1047
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:36,521
I mean ...

1048
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:39,359
sure we lost scholarship and everything.

1049
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,192
Very good.

1050
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:43,321
Morality clause.

1051
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:45,492
Yes.

1052
01:16:46,533 --> 01:16:48,398
I so worry about that.

1053
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:52,439
This box of Seth,
"Memories of High School.

1054
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:55,007
Katie Powers.

1055
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:57,033
How did you get it?

1056
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,847
I negotiated with Seth.

1057
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:01,480
Can not believe it.

1058
01:17:01,515 --> 01:17:06,077
Best scenes are with me and Chelsea
bedroom.

1059
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:08,178
Thanks.

1060
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:09,990
Yes.

1061
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,257
You!

1062
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,783
You suck it my grandfather.

1063
01:17:14,228 --> 01:17:18,399
Jeremy, I'm sorry. It was a
accident.

1064
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,230
I wanted to kill him.

1065
01:17:20,834 --> 01:17:22,167
Do not you killed.

1066
01:17:22,202 --> 01:17:24,939
Do not you killed grandfather.
You healed. You woke up.

1067
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:27,271
- To exit from the coma it.
- Yes?

1068
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:30,609
Yes, it's a new chance.

1069
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:35,840
It is the Good Sam, room 1321,
if you want to visit.

1070
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,284
Katie, listen.

1071
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:52,127
Tonight I realized that ...

1072
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,928
not want to be your friend.

1073
01:17:57,238 --> 01:17:58,772
Spencer.

1074
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,899
I mean ...

1075
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:18,951
It was you.

1076
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:20,653
Yes.

1077
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:24,332
Why never ...?

1078
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,202
Ryan and I used
same costumaþie that day

1079
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:32,571
and I saw that you were so happy
when you saw that he ...

1080
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:35,410
I am gone.

1081
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,043
- Spencer!
- Should I have to say.

1082
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:40,481
I love you.

1083
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,450
I always loved.

1084
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:47,613
Spencer ...

1085
01:18:54,765 --> 01:18:58,098
But Chelsea and you, tonight ...

1086
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:02,069
Keep it. A to appear on CNN with this.

1087
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:05,336
Seth, wait. A to do what you want.

1088
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:10,643
Look.

1089
01:19:14,618 --> 01:19:16,711
Chelsea, about what you said
May now ..

1090
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,424
How can be sure that the directory
we will catch?

1091
01:19:20,459 --> 01:19:22,221
Spencer, I can not.

1092
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:25,661
I sucked it last year.

1093
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:29,097
How do you think I was the best?
To my notes?

1094
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:35,067
Chelsea, I do not think that you're in
still the best in class.

1095
01:19:37,508 --> 01:19:39,066
Seth, what are you doing?

1096
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:40,870
Let's go!

1097
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:21,110
You are sure that you're ready?

1098
01:20:22,888 --> 01:20:24,116
Yes.

1099
01:20:27,226 --> 01:20:28,523
And me.

1100
01:20:40,873 --> 01:20:42,340
What the hell?

1101
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:46,879
- I'm sorry.
- No, Spencer. It's okay.

1102
01:20:47,013 --> 01:20:50,482
I mean, after so long

1103
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:53,850
of waiting, an hour in addition there is nothing.

1104
01:20:55,455 --> 01:20:56,683
Katie ...

1105
01:20:56,789 --> 01:20:58,051
What?

1106
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,285
You gre it's qualification.

1107
01:21:03,663 --> 01:21:05,824
God, yes.

1108
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:07,194
Yes.

1109
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:13,131
- Katie.
