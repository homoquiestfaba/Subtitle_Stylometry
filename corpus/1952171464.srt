1
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:29,488
That one's not ours.

2
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:30,122
You sure?

3
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:34,259
I authorize all cadavers
and associated research.

4
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,726
He's not ours.

5
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:40,532
People donate their
body to science,

6
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,534
end up submerged in a pond?

7
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:43,769
Cram med in a car?

8
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,705
Body farm; creepy.

9
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,240
A body farm
is not creepy.

10
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,376
It's a controlled study of
situational decomposition.

11
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,878
All in all,
a very helpful place.

12
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,380
Tell that to Slim
hanging from the tree.

13
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,917
Whoever placed our victim here
knew that the body farm existed.

14
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:00,252
What they didn't know
is each body

15
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,687
is tracked by
a bunch of scientists.

16
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,922
Can't just slip a card
into the deck.

17
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:08,086
Well, he's not in rigor.
TSD is under six hours.

18
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,788
I'll move him as soon as
you're finished.

19
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,230
- Any I.D.? - None.

20
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,664
Okay, then move him.

21
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:20,772
Gunshot wound to the chest.

22
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,674
Well, look.

23
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,142
One of your friends.

24
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:36,822
It's a carpet beetle.

25
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:37,856
It shouldn't be here.

26
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,359
Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind

27
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,896
Carpet beetles are the last
to arrive at a corpse...

28
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,597
when it's almost a skeleton.

29
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:48,157
I mean, this guy's still fresh.

30
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,576
David, get this body
out of here now!

31
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,211
We got cross-contamination!

32
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,048
Wow! You got to go
to the body farm?

33
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:36,648
Yeah.

34
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,717
I've always wanted
to go there.

35
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:39,918
What was it like?

36
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:40,519
Quiet.

37
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,388
I hear Grissom
goes there all the time.

38
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:45,557
Like, even on his nights off.

39
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:48,993
Why does that
not surprise me?

40
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:53,532
Man, something stinks
in here again.

41
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:55,834
What, bad milk?
Cottage- cheese bad?

42
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,503
Worse. It's all
over my sandwich.

43
00:03:58,503 --> 00:03:59,868
Smell that.

44
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,045
Yeah.

45
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,115
He's got one of his
experiments in there.

46
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,416
You're kidding me?

47
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,484
Bugs or blood?

48
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,285
Not bugs.

49
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,320
Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,290
Someone has got to talk
to Grissom about this.

51
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,258
Talk to me about what?

52
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:23,217
You leaving your
experiments in our
refrigerator.

53
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,231
The lab fridge was full. I put in last night.

54
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,966
I'm going to test for horizontal motion
on bloodstains.

55
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,102
Vis-a-vis surface
textures.

56
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,771
Hey, any of you guys got
any linoleum at home?

57
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,807
That blood
is rank, man.

58
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,176
That's why the Red Cross
gives it to us...

59
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:40,371
'cause it's past
its expiration date.

60
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:46,385
Anything new on the
body farm victim?

61
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,819
I gave the prints
to Identification.

62
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,921
They're running through
the base s now.

63
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,785
Okay.

64
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:57,852
I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.

65
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,966
Way to go, Nick. You really told him.

66
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,734
I told him. He just...

67
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:03,969
doesn't hear it.

68
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,203
Yeah.

69
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,205
Well...

70
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:11,810
the entry wound tells me
the body sustained a projectile.

71
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,744
A bullet.

72
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:17,082
But there's no bullet
fragments in the tissue,

73
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,317
and no exit wound.

74
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,851
So, how do
you explain that?

75
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,945
Bullet wounds usually
leave bullet evidence.

76
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:31,294
There's no evidence
of a bullet in this wound tract.

77
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,298
So, let's excise it.

78
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,300
Do a more
localized search.

79
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,302
That was my next suggestion.

80
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,669
What's your best tool for excising the tissue
of our Mr. Doe?

81
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,040
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore.

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,975
Database says
that our victim

83
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:45,477
is Mike Kimble,

84
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:46,345
age 38.

85
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,847
He has a townhouse
in Summerlin.

86
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,583
Brass is going to
meet us there along with the rest of the unit.

87
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,353
My bet says that it's
the primary crime scene.

88
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,651
Good.

89
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:59,048
Aren't you coming?

90
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:02,194
We're excising
a wound tract.

91
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,962
Sounds fascinating.

92
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,224
It is.

93
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:16,007
Is that Mike Kimble's house?

94
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:17,406
That's it.

95
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,814
Seems like somebody
beat us here.

96
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:23,682
You think?

97
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:27,252
Neighbor called it in.
She smelled the smoke.

98
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:29,888
Thought he was barbecuing
in his living room.

99
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,656
Where's his neighbor now?

100
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:33,125
Over there talking to Brass.

101
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:39,398
Um... no, I didn't hear any
noise coming from Mike's place last night.

102
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,065
But, um...

103
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,401
I was wearing my headphones,
doing my workout.

104
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,803
Did Mr. Kimble have many
visitors to his house?

105
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:47,406
Other than his clients,
just, um...

106
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:48,540
just his fiancé, Jane.

107
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,710
Uh... but they usually
stayed at her place.

108
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,407
Do you have the full name
and address of the victim's fiancé, Jane?

109
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,815
Yes, actually, I do.

110
00:06:56,815 --> 00:06:57,616
It's in my kitchen.

111
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:05,524
As soon as they let me back in,
I can get for you.

112
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,293
Something...

113
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,494
a metal fragment.

114
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:13,665
It's not like any bullet
I've ever seen.

115
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,534
Titanium...

116
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,202
maybe a pin.

117
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,037
From the ribs?

118
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,239
Oh, here's
the manufacturer's number.

119
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:24,609
I should've bought stock
when I first started finding

120
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,373
all these medical implants.

121
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:34,519
Bovine.

122
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,954
Excuse me?

123
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:36,621
Genus Hypaderma.

124
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:40,225
These are normally found
in the intestinal tract of cows.

125
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,395
These maggots aren't
found in humans.

126
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,896
Foreign tissue. Cow.

127
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,531
Makes absolutely no sense.

128
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:51,703
The body farm also studies
animals, not just humans.

129
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,973
This more of your
cross-contamination?

130
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:58,409
Only one way to find out.

131
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,796
What up, Doc?

132
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:18,997
Hey, there you are.

133
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,158
Sorry I'm late.

134
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,463
D.A. Wanted an update
on my robbery case.

135
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:26,437
Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting
my walk-through.

136
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,799
The desk is crispy.

137
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,383
There's a burn pattern for you.

138
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,452
Fire burns upward.

139
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,255
This is moving downward.

140
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,390
Defies the laws of physics.

141
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,858
Fire's draw n to fire.

142
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:49,394
Well, you know
what we got to do.

143
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,329
Check out the upstairs?

144
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,492
Well, the guy
who started the fire

145
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,135
wanted to make sure the
bedroom got it worse.

146
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:58,537
How do you know it's a guy?

147
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:00,171
Why are you jumping the gun?

148
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:01,740
Well, according to Sara,

149
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,775
94% of all arsonists
are male.

150
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:05,777
Yeah, that sounds
like Sara.

151
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,813
The fire burned longest here.

152
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,805
It's the point of origin
right here.

153
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,720
I don't smell any accelerant.

154
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,788
Could have burned off.

155
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,056
Fabric would have fueled it.

156
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,358
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

157
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:22,121
Afire burning downward?

158
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:26,854
Must have found an accelerant.

159
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:32,929
Furniture polish.

160
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,872
Warrick...

161
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:47,781
Is that blood?

162
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,358
Oh, man.

163
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:55,727
Something bad happened here.

164
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:59,595
This fire is just a cover-up.

165
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,839
Are you serious?

166
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,941
Hold on a second. Hi.

167
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,877
I'm Detective Jim Brass.

168
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:14,212
Is Jane Bradley in?

169
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,780
She's in the kitchen.

170
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,749
Really? No.

171
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:21,553
This can't be happening.

172
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:22,687
Mike is dead?

173
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:27,058
I don't know how
I'm going to tell my kids.

174
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,293
They love Mike.

175
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,128
You and Mike were engaged?

176
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:35,361
The wedding was supposed to
be in a week at the Tangiers.

177
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,374
No sweets after 10:00.
What's the rule?

178
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,909
Oh, come on, Mom,
I'm starving.

179
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,036
Have an apple.

180
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:52,350
He's growing
like a weed.

181
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,487
What was your
fiancé's business?

182
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,389
He was a photographer.

183
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,190
He did weddings, events.

184
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,861
We argued over who'd
do our wedding because

185
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,421
he didn't trust
anyone else's work.

186
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,067
Hi.

187
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,369
How many times have I said you have to

188
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,038
You can't just
barge in this house.

189
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,739
Maybe as many times
as I've asked you

190
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:17,409
to have the kids
ready and out front
on my nights?

191
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,178
You must be the ex-husband.

192
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,546
What's going on?

193
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,214
Are the kids
all right?

194
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,383
Is Jake in some kind of trouble?

195
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,484
No.

196
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,520
Mike Kimble was
killed tonight.

197
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,852
Are you serious?

198
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,528
Would you mind
showing us your hands?

199
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,362
My hands? Why?

200
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:42,333
To see if there's any gunpowder
or evidence of a burn on them.

201
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,699
Sure.

202
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,038
Look, uh... I don't
want to be rude, but...

203
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,441
I stop paying alimony the day
Mike and Jane get married.

204
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,043
I mean, I'm the last person
who would have killed him.

205
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,446
If we wanted to get in touch
with you,

206
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:55,914
how would we reach you?

207
00:11:55,914 --> 00:12:00,218
You can reach me at any of my four grocery

208
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,086
Anytime.

209
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:01,920
We'll be in touch.

210
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,124
I'm going to get the kids,
if that's all right.

211
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,752
They're in the den.

212
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,850
Accelerant.

213
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,078
Hey.

214
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,954
Yeah, Warrick said
the fire was orange,

215
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,752
so low-temperature fuel.

216
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,625
Something accessible...

217
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,428
gasoline, kerosene...

218
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,764
I thought you
were in post.

219
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,364
I was.

220
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:50,502
So, anyway, this is where
the fire started.

221
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,436
Victim's bedroom.

222
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,072
Grissom...

223
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:34,879
Gris...

224
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,679
Sometimes it's about
where the fire
isn't.

225
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,340
Sometimes I hate this job.

226
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,356
We have evidence

227
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:19,190
that Mike
may have had

228
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,427
an inappropriate
relationship
with your daughter.

229
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,429
What kind of evidence?

230
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,865
Photographic
and definitive.

231
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,566
That the man
I was going to marry

232
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,591
somehow sexually...

233
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:33,304
No, I don't believe that.

234
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:34,505
Things like
this happen...

235
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,441
sometimes right
under our noses.

236
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:40,545
We're going to have to talk with your

237
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:44,115
Jody, we found pictures
in Mike's house

238
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:45,216
of you posing.

239
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:49,380
Tell her Mike would
never do anything
to hurt you.

240
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,825
In some of the pictures...

241
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:56,227
He truly was like
a father to both kids.

242
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,890
I wish you would
just listen once.

243
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,701
In some of the pictures,

244
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:07,228
you're wearing a bathing suit.

245
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,967
Do you remember
Mike taking them?

246
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,222
Jody...

247
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:28,726
Anything that he did to you
was not your fault.

248
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:34,460
You can tell me
if Mike took
those pictures.

249
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,868
Jody?

250
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,436
Honey?

251
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:41,005
I loved Mike

252
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:43,439
and he loved me.

253
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,610
The daughter clammed up.

254
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:57,956
Seems to be in the
protect-the-abuser trap.

255
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,792
I'm going to take her
over to the hospital
for a SART exam.

256
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,462
What are the chances Mom knew what her

257
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,396
I've seen it happen.

258
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,864
As a mother,
I hope not.

259
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,566
Yeah, right.

260
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:10,796
I'm going
to look into it.

261
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:21,346
Well, our photo guys tell me
those pictures were taken

262
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,015
with Mike Kimble's
type of camera.

263
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,083
Yeah?

264
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,351
Yeah.

265
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:28,086
What are you
doing here?

266
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,520
A thousand points
of light,

267
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,354
and I only need one
to clear up this picture.

268
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,831
The blur equals
the length of the light.

269
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,166
If I can compress this light
back into a point,

270
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:45,795
then the rest of the picture
gets clear.

271
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,575
That's how they got
Hinkley's image

272
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,443
when he was shooting the prez.

273
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,212
What is that...

274
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:56,681
there...
bottom right corner?

275
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:57,882
Is that a finger?

276
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,517
Yeah, I think so.

277
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,651
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?

278
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,654
A professional photographer
gets a finger in the shot?

279
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:06,524
Maybe his good hand
was otherwise engaged.

280
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,292
I'm going to work
on that for a while

281
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,962
and see if I can get
some ridge detail.

282
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:12,296
Maybe even a fat print.

283
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:14,298
I'll... I'll see you later.

284
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,322
All right.

285
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,471
So this is your experiment, huh?

286
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:25,043
So, because you found beef in
the wound tracts of the victim,

287
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:29,714
you think the meat might be
from one of the body farm cows?

288
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,817
Did the fly find
the beef in the wound

289
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,684
and lay its eggs,

290
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,620
or did it bring
the beef with him?

291
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,656
I did an experiment similar
to this in San Francisco,

292
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,491
except the cross-contamination
was blood.

293
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,825
Wasn't a murder case,
but it was instructional.

294
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,066
None of these
beef particles

295
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:52,503
are as big as the tissue found in Mike
Kimble's

296
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:56,207
And I found out
the ex-husband

297
00:17:56,207 --> 00:18:00,478
is the proud owner
of a registered handgun.

298
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,447
Hmm. What
does that mean?

299
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:05,316
It means I need
to see that gun.

300
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:06,150
Uh... Grissom?

301
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,253
Aren't you going
to tell me anything?

302
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:09,954
About?

303
00:18:09,954 --> 00:18:13,591
The case, the meat,
what you found...?

304
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,625
I'm working it.

305
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,595
I thought I was
working it with you.

306
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:18,729
Yes.

307
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,864
You're right,
you are.

308
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:23,468
So, take some photos
of the experiment for the D.A.,

309
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,470
and then get rid
of that stuff.

310
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,239
That meat... the raw meat... me?

311
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:28,840
Yeah.

312
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,042
How many meals
have we shared together?

313
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:31,909
I don't know.

314
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:32,643
Take a guess...

315
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,946
over a year working together.

316
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,681
.30

317
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,515
I'm a vegetarian.

318
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,609
Everyone here knows
I'm a vegetarian.

319
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,720
I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up

320
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,557
It pains me to see ground beef;
forget about cleaning it up.

321
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,359
Okay.

322
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,951
Have Nick do it.

323
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:58,703
You're telling me

324
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:02,006
this bastard took
pictures of my daughter?

325
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:04,742
We found them
in his house.

326
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:08,479
I never liked the way
he looked at Jody.

327
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,413
I never liked it.

328
00:19:09,413 --> 00:19:10,948
How did he look at her?

329
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:12,183
Touchy - feely.

330
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,413
It wasn't normal.

331
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:17,822
I told Jane when
she started seeing him,

332
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:18,723
he's not a good guy.

333
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,892
He's not good for our family.

334
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:25,930
But you can't control
who your ex-wife dates.

335
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,566
Russ Bradley,
Gil Grissom, CSI Lab.

336
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:30,557
Thanks for coming in.

337
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,371
Is this your gun?

338
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:34,305
Yes.

339
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,541
May I take a look at it?

340
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,270
Please.

341
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,918
It's been cleaned.

342
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:47,618
Of course.

343
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,053
You never store
a dirty firearm.

344
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:51,789
May I ask what kind
of ammunition you use?

345
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,990
A.38 special.

346
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,787
It takes.38s.

347
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,686
Whatever's on sale.

348
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,578
There you are.

349
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:17,605
Got something
for you from Trace.

350
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,417
Sara?

351
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:22,318
Almost finished.

352
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,493
They isolated
the accelerant
used in the fire.

353
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,256
It's alcohol-based.

354
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,800
Acetone,
methyl methacrylate?

355
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,568
Nail polish remover.

356
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:40,972
Guess that's
the six percent
no one talks about...

357
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:42,837
female fire-starters.

358
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:53,384
What's this... a burn?

359
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,752
Yeah.

360
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,188
How'd that happen?

361
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,588
On a curling iron.

362
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,103
I'll give you
a prescription
for antibiotics.

363
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,971
Let's do the last portion
of your exam now, okay?

364
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,504
Excuse me.

365
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,382
Okay, lay back.

366
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,617
Scoot back
a little more.

367
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:28,552
Just a little more.

368
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:29,520
Very good.

369
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,989
Take a deep breath.

370
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,957
This won't
hurt at all.

371
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:07,955
It's melting.

372
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,564
Sara's not going
to be too happy

373
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,899
with that
experiment
in the fridge.

374
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:52,164
I'm putting it
in the freezer.

375
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:58,242
The doctor finished
the exam on Jody Bradley.

376
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,677
Physical findings:

377
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:03,113
Scarring,
chronic sexual abuse.

378
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:06,384
Well, have Brass get a warrant for the

379
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,420
Check the evidence we recovered from the

380
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,688
They stayed in both places.

381
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:13,257
Listen, there's a good chance the

382
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:15,726
She had second-degree burns on her wrist.

383
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:17,461
One thing at a time.

384
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:18,396
Right.

385
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,597
You coming with?

386
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:20,731
I can't.

387
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:21,832
Take Nick.

388
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:24,402
Right.

389
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,563
Experiment.

390
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,017
That's the girl's
nightgown.

391
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,191
We've got some samples coming in.

392
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,492
They're priority one.

393
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:22,960
What is that... what did you find?

394
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,163
Child Services will be remanding Jody to a

395
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:29,428
Was my fiancé involved in any way?

396
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,436
He's not your fiancé.

397
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,097
Not anymore, anyway.

398
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,435
Jim?

399
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,575
I just got back from the events office at the

400
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:40,044
where you and Mike were supposed
to be married.

401
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:42,444
You canceled your wedding five days ago.

402
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,683
I even have your
credit card receipt for the ten percent

403
00:24:45,683 --> 00:24:49,887
You didn't like the way he looked at your

404
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,821
No. I just got cold feet.

405
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,149
Convenient timing.

406
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,125
Look, when Russ and I got
married 20 years ago,

407
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,794
you couldn't find
two happier people,

408
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,663
and now we can barely stand to be civil.

409
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:02,154
I didn't want to make another mistake.

410
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,834
It wasn't that you sensed
what was going on?

411
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,404
Mike would not do
what he's being accused of.

412
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:09,507
Believe me.

413
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,340
I'll believe the DNA.

414
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,315
Feels like blackjack, you know?

415
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,652
You guys all fanned around the table,

416
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:24,321
waiting to see which card I'll reveal next.

417
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:26,090
Greg, this is an abuse case

418
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,425
involving a minor.

419
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:31,417
Right. Sorry.

420
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,964
So, I have DNA samples from every male

421
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,599
that lives with Jody Bradley,

422
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,635
full-time or weekends.

423
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,971
First, I have Mike Kimble, the fiancé

424
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,840
Dead fiancé

425
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,042
"Match not found."

426
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,844
You got to be kidding me.

427
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,678
Sorry, Captain.

428
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:50,581
The guy has naked pictures of her in his

429
00:25:50,581 --> 00:25:52,883
The mother called off their wedding.

430
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:54,718
DNA takes a pair.

431
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:57,221
So whose is it, the father?

432
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,391
"Match not found."

433
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,256
Third and last.

434
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:05,927
Give me that.

435
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,701
How did we miss that?

436
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,534
No. No, I never did

437
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,540
anything like that to my sister. No.

438
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,375
How do you explain your semen on

439
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:23,005
I can't... I can't.

440
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,484
The county automatically
provides your son

441
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:28,619
with an advocate.

442
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,214
We can't proceed
until he arrives.

443
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,829
You getting anywhere with the print?

444
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,998
I'm still trying
to enhance it.

445
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,967
It's kind of frustrating,
that, uh...

446
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:46,437
this picture puts us at the very moment of

447
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,268
but we can't see
what she's seeing.

448
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,074
They say the eyes are the window to the

449
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:52,843
Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the

450
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:53,777
In a way, it's true.

451
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:57,581
The aqueous fluid and the
vitreous in the human eye

452
00:26:57,581 --> 00:27:00,417
allows for an image to be reflected in it.

453
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:05,589
Well, maybe... if I enhanced the reflection in

454
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:09,426
with the right combination of algorithms...

455
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:13,294
I think my Popsicles are ready.

456
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:16,033
Jake, did you take pictures of your sister

457
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,636
and plant them in Mike Kimble's house?

458
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,837
No.

459
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:24,475
You do have keys
to his house, though. Right?

460
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:28,946
I mean, your mother told us that both you

461
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,981
Yes, but I didn't
plant anything.

462
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,684
He didn't take the pictures. He didn't plant

463
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:37,988
He has no idea how his DNA got in his

464
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:41,583
Yeah, maybe a little hobbit put it there.

465
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,029
That's it, we're done.

466
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,462
All right, hold on.

467
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,966
You mind if I talk to Jake alone?

468
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,558
To what end?

469
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,469
I have a hunch.

470
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,308
Everyone does it, Jake.

471
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:01,812
You just... feel like you're the only one.

472
00:28:01,812 --> 00:28:03,480
Then, when you don't do it,

473
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,916
it happens in your sleep anyway, right?

474
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,754
Yeah. And then you go to take a leak,

475
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,222
dust off the equipment,

476
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:16,556
you just grab the first thing that's handy,

477
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:22,332
It was just... on the hamper.

478
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:24,425
Your sister's nightgown?

479
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:30,407
The next thing I know, I'm getting, like...

480
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:33,043
questioned by the police

481
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:34,645
and my parents are looking at me

482
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,047
like I'm some sort of...
pervert.

483
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:40,617
Yeah, that's rough. Rough.

484
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:43,120
Well, listen, in the future, dude...

485
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,422
even if the situation's
embarrassing,

486
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:48,823
the truth's probably the best policy there.

487
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,894
Yeah.

488
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:53,330
Hey, listen, you
ever notice your mom's boyfriend

489
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,199
acting weird around your sister?

490
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,266
Like a little, uh...

491
00:28:56,266 --> 00:29:00,760
too friendly,
too forward?

492
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,540
Mmm, no.

493
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,879
No. I mean, my sister is
the one that's kind of weird.

494
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,180
Really?
Yeah.

495
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,781
How?

496
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:12,850
She's just always just,
you know,

497
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,884
"Mike's coming over.

498
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,153
I can't wait
till Mike gets here."

499
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:18,088
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

500
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,256
You like the guy?

501
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:22,960
When, uh... my parents
were getting divorced,

502
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,363
my mom, she cried,
like, every day,

503
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:28,599
and, uh, Mike showed up

504
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,834
and she stopped crying

505
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:35,737
so, yeah. I guess.

506
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,791
What are you doing here?

507
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,958
Isn't this your day off?

508
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:59,395
On the day you plan
to expend a meat bullet?

509
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:02,900
Frozen?

510
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,104
Yeah, I had to freeze it with
a touch of liquid nitrogen.

511
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,096
Well, I'm ready
to watch history.

512
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,426
Bullet-like entry wound.

513
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:35,199
The meat disintegrates.

514
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:38,969
Lost in
the soft tissue. Hmm.

515
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,637
You're quite
a marksman, Russ.

516
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:45,976
And inventive... you managed
to build a bullet made of meat.

517
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:49,847
The meat from the projectile
was visually indistinguishable

518
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:53,806
from the victim's
stomach tissue.

519
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,819
We know that
your gun was clean

520
00:30:55,853 --> 00:31:00,813
but it turns out
that your reloader wasn't.

521
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,826
Yeah. We got this from
your garage on a warrant.

522
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,829
We figured a gun enthusiast like yourself

523
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:08,024
Packs gunpowder
into used shell casings.

524
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:10,863
Cheaper than buying
new rounds, right?

525
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:12,903
The material that
was on your reloader

526
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:15,038
is consistent with
the material we found

527
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,907
in the victim's wound tract.

528
00:31:16,907 --> 00:31:19,307
Ground beef.

529
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:24,579
A father knows.

530
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:30,485
He was giving her gifts...
you know, cameras.

531
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:37,823
He gave her a camera?

532
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,033
And the wedding was,
like, a week off,

533
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,768
and he was going
to be living

534
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:47,204
under the same roof as
my children full-time.

535
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:48,872
When I went over there,

536
00:31:48,872 --> 00:31:52,409
you know, I was just going
to set him straight, right?

537
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,077
You know what he says?

538
00:31:54,077 --> 00:31:56,380
Hey, I can't help it
if she likes me.

539
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,016
I guess it's like
mother, like daughter.

540
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:03,921
You touch my little girl,
and I will kill you.

541
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,322
Too late.

542
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,057
That's when I lost it.

543
00:32:07,057 --> 00:32:09,726
Then you dumped him
at the body farm.

544
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:14,031
Your grocery chain makes
regular meat deliveries there

545
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:16,500
for experimental purposes.

546
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,235
Then what?

547
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:21,738
You arsoned his place
to cover up the murder?

548
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:25,976
Grabbed the nail polish remover
from the bedside table,

549
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:28,111
poured it all over the place?

550
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:30,047
I'll tell you the truth.

551
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,048
I...

552
00:32:31,048 --> 00:32:33,984
I feel relieved.

553
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:37,387
I'd like to make
a formal confession.

554
00:32:37,387 --> 00:32:38,655
He can confess
to the homicide,

555
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:40,891
but we're still examining
evidence in the arson.

556
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:44,127
The guy wants to take the heat
for his daughter on the arson.

557
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,629
Well, where's
the harm in that?

558
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,898
Well, the harm would be
to the justice system

559
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,366
unless I misunderstand
our place in it.

560
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:52,202
Don't you think that little
girl's been through enough?

561
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:54,271
What I think, and what
the evidence proves,

562
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:58,037
are possibly
two different things.

563
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,413
What is this?

564
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:05,215
It's, uh... just what it says:

565
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:07,918
It's a request
for a leave of absence...

566
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:11,655
six months... year, maybe.

567
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,522
Why?

568
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,157
I was thinking
of checking out

569
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:18,287
the federal government
system... FBI...

570
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,865
We have the best lab
in the country.

571
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:25,702
I need a different
work environment.

572
00:33:25,702 --> 00:33:27,170
What does
that
mean?

573
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:32,309
One with, um... communication...

574
00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:33,744
respect.

575
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:35,879
Everybody here respects you.

576
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:36,613
You don't.

577
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:40,984
Is this about
that hamburger thing?

578
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:43,053
No. Grissom...

579
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,555
this is not about
that hamburger thing.

580
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,391
I-I-I don't believe you.

581
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:49,860
How can you reduce
everything that I've said

582
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,927
to some kind
of single quirk?

583
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:54,556
Do you think the problem here
is just about me?

584
00:33:55,565 --> 00:34:00,025
If you don't sign my leave,
I'm going to have to quit.

585
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:07,574
Hey, Sara?

586
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,347
The lab needs you here.

587
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:17,986
Great.

588
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:28,031
Did you hear the dad

589
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:29,900
copped a plea
on the murder,

590
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,668
and the D.A.
Expedite d it?

591
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,637
Voluntary man,
first offense.

592
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,205
Out on bail.
Free in four.

593
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:37,474
No jury was going
to convict a father

594
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,810
for killing
his daughter's abuser.

595
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,244
What do you have?

596
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:41,978
Accelerant.

597
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:44,881
Identical to the type
found at the arson.

598
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:48,373
Police got it out
of Jody's gym locker.

599
00:34:57,494 --> 00:35:01,631
Well, looks as if Jody
was probably telling the truth.

600
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:05,335
She did burn herself
on a curling iron.

601
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:07,997
So who started the fire?

602
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,323
Hey.
Hey.

603
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:29,726
You get anywhere
with those fingerprints?

604
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,360
Back burner.

605
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,431
I've been working
on this reflection in her eye.

606
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,666
You see
what I'm seeing?

607
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,001
No.

608
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:38,568
Come on.

609
00:35:38,568 --> 00:35:41,505
I've been working on this
enhancement all night.

610
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:42,873
Look closer.

611
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,141
What is it?

612
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:48,544
A clock? A mirror?

613
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,452
It's got a latch...
a lock.

614
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:56,953
A porthole?

615
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:59,589
It's a porthole?

616
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,158
Yeah.

617
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:05,686
These pictures
were taken on a boat.

618
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,368
Miss Bradley.

619
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,235
Yes.

620
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:13,336
Warrick Brown.

621
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:17,674
Your fiancé Mike...
did he own a boat?

622
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,743
A boat? No.

623
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:20,343
No?

624
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:22,479
Did he borrow one
or rent one?

625
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:25,015
He wanted to borrow
my ex-husband's boat,

626
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,616
but he was
too proud to ask.

627
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,385
Your ex-husband
owned a boat?

628
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,821
He bought one
after our divorce.

629
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:33,089
I've never been on it.

630
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:36,252
Okay. Thank you.

631
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,014
Jody...

632
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:08,149
we know that Mike
gave you his camera.

633
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,863
We suspect that
your father used it

634
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:17,799
to take pictures
of you on his boat.

635
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:23,903
We believe that

636
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,243
he then placed
the camera back
at Mike's

637
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:31,647
to implicate him,
along with the pictures.

638
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:36,086
He said I was like my mom
when she was young

639
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:38,221
and they were happy.

640
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:44,558
He said having me was
like having his family back.

641
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,133
Did you ever
tell your mom?

642
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:57,173
I tried.

643
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:58,675
I don't want to go to Dad's.

644
00:37:58,675 --> 00:37:59,976
You know what the judge said:

645
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:01,111
Two weeks with Dad,
two with me.

646
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:09,246
Jody, we have strong forensic evidence

647
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,249
But cases like this are
very difficult to prove.

648
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,954
A victim testifying
makes all the difference.

649
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:23,333
He told me if I ever talked
he'd kill me.

650
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,536
Jody, if you don't talk...

651
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,738
I told Mike...

652
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:31,400
and he was going to fix things.

653
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,817
And my dad killed him...

654
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:42,444
okay?

655
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:47,318
Catherine.

656
00:38:50,226 --> 00:38:52,128
What is this?

657
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:55,632
Found it on the boat.

658
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,533
DNA just ran it.

659
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,306
She's under 14, right?

660
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:05,672
Yeah. 12.

661
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,347
He didn't take pictures
of his daughter.

662
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,657
He never touched her.

663
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:23,326
He's a loving, devoted father
who works hard

664
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:27,664
at his chain of grocery stores
to keep her in good schools.

665
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:31,760
Except when she's on his boat,
right?

666
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:37,307
This is your sleeping bag
we took off your boat.

667
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:39,175
Our lab turned it
inside-out.

668
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:40,443
The discoloration you see

669
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:44,748
is a mixture of vaginal
and seminal fluid...

670
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:47,876
your daughter's and yours.

671
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:49,686
Okay.

672
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:51,788
Don't say a word, Russ.

673
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:52,622
He doesn't have to.

674
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:55,955
The sleeping bag's talking
loud and clear.

675
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:00,430
Brad, make me a deal.

676
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,398
I can't.

677
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:02,399
What do you mean, you can't?

678
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,300
You got me four years
for murder.

679
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:04,968
I can't.

680
00:40:04,968 --> 00:40:07,203
You can get me something.

681
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:08,204
No, he can't.

682
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:09,706
In the state of Nevada

683
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:11,307
we're all bound
by a legal statute.

684
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:14,708
The sexual assault of a minor
age 14 and under

685
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:19,806
is a mandatory life sentence
with no possibility for parole.

686
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,471
Excuse me.

687
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:43,940
Could I talk to
you for a moment?

688
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,676
Why don't you wait
over there, sweetie.

689
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,377
Okay.

690
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:51,047
I owe you an apology.

691
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:53,316
I have an eight-year-old
daughter.

692
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,451
It's okay.

693
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:58,444
You were
looking out for mine.

694
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,874
Tough case, huh?

695
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:21,275
Just give me a straight ahead murder any

696
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,216
Well, you wouldn't
be human if it
didn't affect you.

697
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:33,714
I heard about you and Sara.

698
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:39,424
Sara... you know,
she gets very emotional.

699
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,161
Are you in denial?

700
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,698
No, that's... no, no.
Way too analytical.

701
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,497
Wow, you got
burned bad, huh?

702
00:41:51,841 --> 00:41:53,468
Welcome to the club.

703
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,479
I got third-degree burns
from my marriage.

704
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,948
Happens to everybody. Everybody just

705
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:01,451
Good.

706
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:02,852
Let's move on.

707
00:42:02,852 --> 00:42:04,254
But you have
to deal with it.

708
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:05,955
You have to deal
with it first.

709
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:07,257
You got to deal with it

710
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,324
before it goes away.

711
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:10,485
You are the supervisor.

712
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,155
You have responsibilities,
and people are making

713
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:15,187
a family around you
whether you like it not...

714
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:17,495
whether you give them
permission or not.

715
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,671
We don't have to go
to the Grand Tetons together.

716
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:24,196
Just... every now and then,

717
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,368
you got to lift your head up
out of that microscope.

718
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,570
Yeah.

719
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:09,916
Yeah, hi. I'd like to get
some flowers for a girl.

720
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,248
No, no. Not flowers.

721
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:13,915
A plant. A living plant.

722
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:15,325
She likes vegetation.

723
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:18,027
Yeah, that'd be fine.

724
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:20,393
To a "Sara Sidle."

725
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,889
Deliver it at the CSI Division,
Las Vegas Police Department...

726
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:26,436
the one out
on North Trop Boulevard.

727
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:29,606
Yeah, you can bill me
at the same place.

728
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:32,175
Gil Grissom.

729
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,210
The sentiment?

730
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,013
Oh. Oh. On the card. Yeah.

731
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:41,084
Um... uh...

732
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:44,153
Have it say...

733
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:48,358
Have it say, uh...

734
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,260
"From Grissom."

735
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,929
Thank you.
