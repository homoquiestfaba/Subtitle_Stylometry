Looks like

What was the message when you
answered the page, Skipper?

11

DeAngelo, why do you
call me Skipper?

12
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:36,954
You don't like being
called Skipper?

13
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:37,988
I didn't say that.

14
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,489
I asked you why.

15
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,609
I don't know.
Seems kind of cop-ly.

16
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,544
I'll just call you Chief.

you back,

I want you happy.

19
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:48,782
Call me Skipper.

20
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,755
The caller said
some kids started a fire

out on the point

22
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,458

about their house.

00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,643
It was raining.

24
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:01,094
They leave
their address?

25
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:02,512
They hung up.

26
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:03,563
Eh, probably...

27
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:04,798
A crank.

28

A police officer
cannot afford to be wrong.

29

It has
to be checked out.

30
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,659
He hated
me calling him Skipper.

31
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,077
Have you seen him?

32
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,028
I don't like him.

33
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,529
I didn't ask
if you liked him.

34
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,814
I asked if you'd seen him.

35
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,315
Nope.

36
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,700

that anyone has,

37
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,820
not for months.

38
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:27,838
He didn't...

39
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,673
Like you.
Why do you think?

40
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:31,124
Beats me.

41
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:32,542
What's not to like?

42
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,012
Made me do stupid things.
He made me feel...

43
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,797
Unlikeable.

44
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:39,549
He's not someone who should
spend a lot of time alone.

45
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,519
He made me order a hat.

46
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:43,854
Why did he make you
order a hat?

47
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:44,888
Because it was

48
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:45,889
a stupid thing.

49
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,341
He didn't like
the color of our hats.

50
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,342
He wanted one in...

51
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,894
Navy blue.

52
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:53,346
Stupid.

53
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:54,514
And on the back
he had me embroider...

54
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,683
Chief.

55
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,368
Can I ask you a
question, Skipper?

56
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:00,687
How do I always know
what you're going to say?

57
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,156
Yeah, you finish my sentences.

It's a gift.

59

I sure don't
see any smoke.

60
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,012
It still has to be
checked out, Anthony.

61
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,898
Do you remember
where you ordered that hat?

62
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,049
You want a blue hat?

63
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,554
You know, when I said
it was a stupid thing,

64
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,356
I didn't mean the hat
itself was stupid.

65
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,575
Making me do it
was stupid.

66
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,827
I could have been
writing parking tickets.

67
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:42,662

7:35, we got a call
from State Homicide.

367
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:03,973
And you called Hasty.

368
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,442
Well, Hasty
already knew,

369
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:08,311
so we decided to go
out there together.

370
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,863
(sighs)

371
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:12,532
Do you know of anything specific
that your son-in-law

372
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,417
was working on?
No.

373
00:27:14,452 --> 00:27:16,369
He kept so much inside.

374
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,740
I'm gonna need your help,
Carter.

375
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,659
I will have to talk
to your daughter.

376
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,462
Will you tell me when
you think she's up to it?

377
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,780
Okay.

378
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:30,083
(sighs)

379
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,953
I know you're a good
cop, Chief Stone.

380
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:38,725
Get the man who killed my son.

381
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:49,469
STONE:
<i>There were times</i>

382
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,687
I hated him.

383
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,238
DIX:
Why did you hate him?

384
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,073
Because he wasn't me.

385
00:27:54,108 --> 00:27:55,742
You mean because
you weren't him.

386
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,360
He had my job.

387
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,529
Did you ever wish
he were dead?

388
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,930
Yes.

389
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:04,817
Apparently, I wasn't shy

390
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,920
about telling people
I didn't like him.

391
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:08,505
I thought I only thought it.

392
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,223
How do you feel
about <i>that?</i>

393
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:11,925
How do I feel
about that?

394
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:15,378
I didn't like him.

395
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:20,800
He didn't make me lost my job.

396
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:23,219
That was solely
my accomplishment.

397
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,004
Okay.

398
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:27,173
Are you gonna
obsess about this?

399
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,691
Yes.
Because you're

400
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,176
guilty about
how you feel?

401
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:33,029
'Cause I'm a cop.
(laughs): Good.

402
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,965
That's relatively healthy.
Thank you.

403
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,369
I've lost my people.

404
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,453
What happened?

405
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:41,855
Suitcase didn't
like Butler,

406
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,156
so he quit.

407
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,742
And that's
<i>your</i> fault?

408
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,546
What about Rose?
She was my friend,

409
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,030
and I lost touch.

410
00:28:51,048 --> 00:28:52,882
Did she like Butler?

411
00:28:52,917 --> 00:28:54,300
No.

412
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,135
So she quit.

413
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,387
Apparently.

414
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:58,588
And that's your fault, too?

415
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,256
(exhales)

416
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:01,975
Did I ever
tell you that

417
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,709
you have a hyperactive
sense of responsibility?

418
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:05,728
Several times.

419
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,097
Hasty told me

420
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:11,401
the town council felt they both
had been infected by me.

421
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,686
That guy is
a piece of work.

422
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,389
How can you believe anything
that comes out of his mouth?

423
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,192
I sift through his words
for partial truths.

424
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,160
Well, let me get this straight--
he hires you

425
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,562
because you're a drunk
and thinks he can control you.

426
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:25,564
You prove he can't.

427
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:29,252
You send him to prison for
laundering money for Gino Fish.

428
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:31,337
He gets out of prison,

429
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:35,208
starts up a car dealership with
no visible financial backing.

430
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,594
That would be him.

431
00:29:37,628 --> 00:29:41,014
What's your take on the murders?

432
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:44,300
You miss being a cop, don't you?

433
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,551
Every day.

434
00:29:45,585 --> 00:29:48,521
But being a cop was toxic
for me-- made me drink.

435
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:51,941
Being a cop's the only thing
that makes me drink less.

436
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,592
Word in Paradise is

437
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:54,861
that Butler was dirty.

438
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:58,314
Small town.

439
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:00,566
So, you think he was dirty.

440
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,535
I didn't say that.

441
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:05,438
A cop deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

442
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,409
♪

443
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,674
(sighs)

444
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:40,837
(ringing)

445
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,261
Hello?

446
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,979
It's Jesse.

447
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,348
Is it as cold there as it is

448
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,016
in Toledo, Jesse?

449
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,484
I would have no way

450
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:55,702
of knowing, Mary.

451
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,971
How'd you know?

452
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,723
I didn't.

453
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,159
It's okay, Mom.

454
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,627
Oh.

455
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,715
Hi, Jesse.

456
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,334
Hello, Rose.

457
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,886
Why didn't you tell me
your chair was

458
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,871
so uncomfortable?

459
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,924
I'm sitting at your desk.

460
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,059
Why are you sitting at my desk?

461
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:20,761
Because I'm the police chief.

462
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,596
You're the retired police chief.

463
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,264
Just police chief.

464
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,399
You told me

465
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,650
you'd get your job back.

466
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,768
You said, "Fate wouldn't

467
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,236
do this to me."

468
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,388
Not like this.

469
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:33,056
How are Chief Butler's
wife and family?

470
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,075
(sighs): You heard.
I heard.

471
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,276
Well, I haven't talked to him.

472
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,561
I'm trying to give him
some time.

473
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,230
Carter Hansen's devastated.

474
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:42,282
He loved his son-in-law;
he loved him

475
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,234
like a son.

476
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,570
(sighs) Does April 24
mean anything to you?

477
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:48,922
Yes.

478
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,573
What's it mean?

479
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,259
It's my anniversary.

480
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,844
Okay.

481
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,129
Why would you
bring that up now, Jesse?

482
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,931
I didn't. I mean...

483
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:01,584
(sighs)
I'm sorry, Rose. I...

484
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:04,754
was trying to find out if
Butler was working on anything.

485
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,090
Well, he wasn't
given to sharing.

486
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:09,276
He was even worse than you.

487
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,094
(sighs)
Did he seem...

488
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:13,530
Preoccupied? Yes.
He even shut

489
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,899
his office door sometimes
before he made a phone call.

490
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,701
Maybe he was calling home.

491
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,270
No, he didn't shut his door
like he was calling home.

492
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,905
Is that helpful?

493
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,373
It is.

494
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,526
Is that why you called?

495
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:30,497
Don't shrug.

496
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,631
I called to talk to you.

497
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,051
You could've told me
you were leaving.

498
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,470
The phone works
both ways, Jesse.

499
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,839
So why are you calling now?

500
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,641
I called now because...

501
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,479
Why is this so hard?

502
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:51,418
I called now because I miss you.

503
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,689
(exhales) I'm sorry that
I lost touch, Jesse.

504
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,807
Well, it's hard to keep
in touch with someone

505
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,110
who doesn't want to be found.

506
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,031
You gonna come home?

507
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:07,084
I hope I can.

508
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,469
I hope you will.

509
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,155
(chuckles)

510
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:13,256
Bye, Jesse.

511
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,709
Come back to Paradise,

512
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,878
Rose.

513
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:27,170
STONE:
<i>Figured it out yet?</i>

514
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,390
HEALY: I'm the State Homicide
commander,

515
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,358
not God.

516
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,193
I thought they were
the same thing.

517
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:35,678
Think how disappointed
<i>I</i> am.

518
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,147
"It's an ongoing
investigation.

519
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,617
All I can say at this point is,
we cannot rule out foul play."

520
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,285
Nice.

521
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,688
I thought it was
appropriately obtuse.

522
00:33:45,706 --> 00:33:48,208
"I have nothing more
to say at this time."

523
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:50,911
Now, you, you could have been
a little more eloquent?

524
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,746
Have you ever known me
to be eloquent?

525
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,914
Not hardly.

526
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,298
So we bought a little time.

527
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,333
Very little.

528
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,034
How much was in the duffle bag?

529
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,503
We reckon
about $100,000.

530
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,138
And the powder
was heroin.

531
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,005
High-end smack.

532
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,890
What's that
tell you?

533
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,142
Butler was dirty.

534
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,311
Or somebody set him up.

535
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,013
You never liked him.

536
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,815
I don't think I
ever said that.

537
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,233
Oh, yes, you did.

538
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,321
A cop deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

539
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,440
Well, I can see
the heroin,

540
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,577
but to burn up $100,000
on a setup...

541
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:24,945
No, he was dirty.

542
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,062
If he was dirty, who killed him?

543
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,099
A rival or the guys
he was working with.

544
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,450
If you blow up a cop,
it makes news.

545
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,835
Why not make it look
like an accident?

546
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,120
Somebody had a grudge.

547
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,455
Or somebody set him up.

548
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,592
If the guys he was working with
wanted to kill him,

549
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:39,759
they wouldn't burn the money.

550
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:41,077
Yeah, but if it was a rival,

551
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:43,463
how would he know
he was blowing up the money?

552
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,215
And if Butler was a good cop
who was onto something,

553
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,717
you'd burn a hundred grand
just to make him look dirty.

554
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:50,437
I don't deal in ifs.

555
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,421
I deal in certainty.

556
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,589
Well, it's certain

557
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:55,609
a hundred grand's
a lot of money to burn.

558
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,027
Whose case is this,
yours or mine?

559
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,929
Both.

560
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,864
Who defers to who?

561
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,651
It is State Homicide's policy
to defer to local authorities.

562
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,286
Good.
It's State Homicide's policy

563
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,623
to defer to local authorities
when it is appropriate

564
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:12,325
and effective.

565
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,610
Okay.

566
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:17,297
So, other than the fact
that you think he's clean,

567
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,049
what do you know so far,
Chief Stone?

568
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,001
Nothing.

569
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,219
The explosion was caused by...

570
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,387
An I.E.D.
I thought you didn't know anything.

571
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,673
Knowing and supposing
are two different things.

572
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,959
We've identified
five veterans,

573
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:31,811
all with experience
in explosives,

574
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:34,147
all with criminal records,
all who live in the vicinity.

575
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,850
That's good police work,
Captain Healy.

576
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,235
We were able
to run down four,

577
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,804
but the fifth one-- Thompson--
he's closer to you.

578
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:44,474
So you're deferring
to local authority.

579
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:49,479
I am...
in this instance.

580
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,752
(birds squawking)

581
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,940
What's with the hat?

582
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,859
You got
your job back.

583
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:21,444
I sensed that you did.

584
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:22,562
Did you now?

585
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,148
Actually, I read the paper.

586
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,454
What was he doing
on the beach road?

587
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,456
He got a complaint.

588
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,658
It was obviously bogus.

589
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,359
The caller knew exactly
what to say and not to say

590
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:37,410
to get 'em to show up.

591
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,162
Butler would know that.

592
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,197
Still got to be
checked out.

593
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:42,165
He would do that?

594
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,516
Got him killed.

595
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,419
You didn't like him.

596
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,205
I don't think I ever said that.

597
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,774
Yes, you did, Jesse.

598
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,927
(sighs)

599
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,178
You going out?

600
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:57,230
A couple of days.

601
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,849
Got to shake down some new
equipment, come back in,

602
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:01,384
then the Grand Banks.

603
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,936
Be careful out there.

604
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,689
You come here
to tell me that?

605
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:09,209
I did not.

606
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,531
He had a kid.

607
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,899
He did.

608
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,901
Rose quit.

609
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,503
She did last week.

610
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,005
Because of Butler?

611
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,340
The divorce.

612
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,041
She had to sell
the house.

613
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,209
She left town.

614
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:28,528
My sense is, she'd go
to her mom's in Toledo.

615
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,748
She went to her
mom's in Toledo.

616
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:36,269
We lost touch.

617
00:37:36,304 --> 00:37:38,088
We did.

618
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:43,310
You're a good cop, Suitcase.

619
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,228
So are you, Jesse.

620
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:46,696
It's important
that you remember that.

621
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,949
You'll find out
who did this.

622
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,769
(sighs)

623
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,743

to happen on the 24th.

624
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,328
Besides that.

625
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:04,297
My cop-ly intuition
is a little rusty.

"2A-H-10."

627
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,455
It'll happen
at 2:00 in the morning.

628
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:15,458
My sense is that ten
would designate a sum of money.

629
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:18,261
You got a feeling.

Cast off, Luther.

632
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,677
Okay, Dad.

633
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,698

00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:00,082
Lonely place.

743
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:01,454
It is.

744
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:03,841
No one knows.

745
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,715
I don't want to piss off my ex.

746
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:08,383
I use to do that.

747
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,846
So you said.

748
00:47:11,343 --> 00:47:13,140
But you're still
in love with her.

749
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:15,907
I am.

750
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:17,985
Must make it hard to commit
to another woman.

751
00:47:19,816 --> 00:47:21,247
Not for the short term.

752
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:24,116
Never met a man who couldn't
commit for the short term.

753
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,351
Most men wouldn't have
told me about the ex-wife.

754
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,668
So they could get you
into bed.

755
00:47:27,686 --> 00:47:29,604
So they could
get me into bed.

756
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,189
That doesn't mean
I don't want to.

757
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,523
Don't get your hopes up.

758
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,674
My hopes are always up.

759
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:35,360
Do I have to call
you Chief now?

760
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,562
Only when you feel
so moved.

761
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,847
I'm sleeping with a cop.

762
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:41,482
You've always been sleeping
with a cop.

763
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:43,701
I just wasn't
getting paid for it.

764
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:54,195
Does anyone know?

765
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:55,696
Yes.

766
00:47:55,714 --> 00:47:57,382
Who would that be?

767
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,466
Your roommate knows.

768
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,301
He won't talk.

769
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,837
Do you have time for sex?

770
00:48:02,871 --> 00:48:04,472
If we hurry.

771
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,807
You never hurry.

772
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,375
I have a job now.

773
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:08,810
I have to close the place.

774
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,812
I have to open
the station early.

775
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,981
That's sad.

I'm breaking the law.

HEALY:
You're driving

782
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:19,604
and talking on your cell phone.

783
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:20,906
It's okay. I'm the police chief.

784
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,877
It occurred to me
Butler used a computer.

785
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:26,712
It was in the cruiser.

786
00:49:26,746 --> 00:49:28,747
Not much left of it.

787
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:31,667
One of my college guys managed
to retrieve some of his e-mails.

788
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,085
How do they do that?

789
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,221
I have no idea.

790
00:49:36,256 --> 00:49:37,639
So far, none of the e-mails show

791
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,291
anything incriminating
or exculpatory.

792
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,642
Can you keep a lid on this

793
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,177
till the 24th?

794
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:42,958
Why?

795
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:44,560
Because something's
gonna happen on the 24th.

796
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:47,182
Is that a guess?

797
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:48,400
No, it's a hunch.

798
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:49,485
You see a difference?

799
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,937
A hunch is a guess
that has certainty.

800
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:54,139
Jesse, you can't suppose
yourself into certainty.

801
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,024
I would disagree.

802
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:57,943
You said the guy
who hanged himself

803
00:49:57,977 --> 00:49:59,444
might have worked for Gino Fish.

804
00:49:59,478 --> 00:50:02,614
Gino didn't do this.

805
00:50:02,648 --> 00:50:04,283
How do you know?

806
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,985
'Cause he's too smart
to kill a cop,

807
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,671
and it's not his style.
Is that a guess?

808
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,341
No, that's a hunch.

May I go in the glove box?

814
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:13,068
You may.

815
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,697
Arthur Gallery.

816
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:27,399
I prefer Art.

817
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,734
Okay.

818
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:31,270
Why have you
stopped me, Officer?

819
00:51:31,304 --> 00:51:33,071
I prefer Chief,
and you were speeding, Art.

820
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,089
I was not speeding, Chief.

821
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:35,207
Sure you were.

822
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:36,675
I was speeding,
and you were following me.

823
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:39,044
You were also following me
on the turnpike yesterday.

824
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:41,530
Would you step
out of the car, please.

825
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:47,419
Put your hands on
the hood of the car.

826
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:54,393
Why do I think

827
00:51:54,427 --> 00:51:55,644
you know this routine?

828
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,096
You have no
probable cause, okay?

829
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,197
This is my town.

830
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:01,433
There's no dash cam
in the cruiser

831
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,719
to protect you so you can
toy with the Constitution.

832
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,290
What, no clever response?

833
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,626
If you're armed,
you best tell me now.

834
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,160
If you don't and I find a piece,

835
00:52:12,211 --> 00:52:14,612
I'll just throw it on the seat,
and say I saw it there.

836
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,948
I'm not armed.

837
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,634
Okay.

838
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:21,136
You're not going to search me?

839
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,138
I just did.

840
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:26,224
What's in the trunk?

841
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,810
You have no
probable cause, Chief.

842
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,580
Arthur, please don't make me
start over.

843
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:46,912
It's my deer rifle.

844
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:49,064
308's a good sniper round.

845
00:52:50,783 --> 00:52:52,284
What's the light for, Arthur?

846
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:54,403
You can't hunt at night.

847
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:57,372
Where's the magazine?

848
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:59,591
It's in a separate pouch, okay?

849
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,176
Is the magazine loaded?

850
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,294
Yes, it is, Chief.

851
00:53:02,328 --> 00:53:04,429
Congratulations, Arthur.

852
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:05,881
You just passed the state test.

853
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,000
So, how long do think
it would take you

854
00:53:09,018 --> 00:53:11,669
to grab the loaded magazine,
insert it in your rifle,

855
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,056
chamber a round and be ready
for the next deer...

856
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,307
or whatever?

857
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:17,842
I haven't timed it.

858
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,677
I think you have.

859
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,516
(sighs)
You're free to go, Arthur.

860
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,851
Drive carefully.

861
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:30,405
You're not gonna issue
a citation

862
00:53:30,456 --> 00:53:31,707
for speeding, Chief?

863
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:32,824
I am not.

864
00:53:32,858 --> 00:53:34,626
I'm going to give you
a warning instead.

865
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,829
Don't follow me around.

866
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,376
(car starting)

867
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,761
DIX:
Have you talked to your ex-wife?

868
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,062
STONE:
I'm trying not to.

869
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:55,263
I didn't ask you that.

870
00:53:55,314 --> 00:53:57,416
Have you talked to Jenn?
I haven't talked to Jenn

871
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,050
since before I lost my job.

872
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:00,185
Is that a good thing?

873
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:01,886
Too soon to tell.

874
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,438
Are you drinking?

875
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:05,223
I always drink.

876
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,658
Are you drinking a lot?

877
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:08,443
Probably less than
if I'd been talking to Jenn.

878
00:54:08,494 --> 00:54:10,695
So, that's a good thing.
I didn't say that.

879
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:12,247
No, I said that.

880
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:14,533
Why is this so hard?

881
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:15,917
You come to me for help,

882
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,420
and then you fight me.
It's my nickel.

883
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:20,005
I don't want
to make it too easy.

884
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:23,175
You are a subversive
son of a bitch.

885
00:54:23,209 --> 00:54:26,845
(sighs) I guess
if I'm drinking less,

886
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,264
that would be a good thing.

887
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:30,882
Well, there's a breakthrough,
sort of.

888
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,385
Are you seeing anyone?
I'm seeing you.

889
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,590
I have been seeing someone.

890
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,093
Is <i>that</i> a good thing?

891
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:42,260
Yes.

892
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:44,563
It helped me stay together
after I lost my job.

893
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,448
We've become pals who have sex.

894
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,316
Do you like her?

895
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:50,452
(sighs)

896
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:55,674
I do.

897
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,960
Women usually want more.

898
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,613
Oh, she's more afraid
of commitment than I am.

899
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,615
Okay.

900
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:08,620
I'm paying you 180 bucks
an hour, right?

901
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,338
That's correct.
Our breakthrough

902
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:12,407
came too early.
Put on your cop hat.

903
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,962
Be careful with that.

904
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,514
I'm hoping it's a clue.

905
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:22,567
2A-H-10.
Obviously some kind of code.

906
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:27,105
Whoever wrote it wanted to keep
this information a secret.

907
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:28,406
Butler wrote it.

908
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:32,277
One always reads backwards
on notes of this nature.

909
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:34,112
How do you know that?

910
00:55:34,146 --> 00:55:36,981
Do you my cop-ly opinion or not?
I do.

911
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:38,783
I used to do this kind of work
for a living.

912
00:55:38,817 --> 00:55:42,871
H-10 probably means
a location, or a name

913
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,489
and a location.

914
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,324
2A is a time.

915
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,676
What's that mean?

916
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,679
"H-10 is probably a location,
or a name and a location?"

917
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:51,713
Which is it?

918
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:53,331
I don't know.
What's it say to you?

919
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,966
I think it says
Butler was onto something,

920
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,501
and it got him
and DeAngelo killed.

921
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,769
Well, thinking's
not good enough.

922
00:55:57,803 --> 00:55:59,671
I'm a hunch guy,
not an evidence guy.

923
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,724
If my gut gives me certainty,
that's all I need.

924
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:05,026
Convictions are based
on evidence.

925
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,395
I don't care about convictions.

926
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,564
I care about justice.

927
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:25,363
Morning, Thelma.

928
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,048
Morning, Jesse.

929
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,003
You called me.

930
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:35,307
(Hasty sighs)

931
00:56:35,341 --> 00:56:37,175
Did you see what
she is wearing?

932
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:39,877
Who?
Thelma.

933
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,597
I'm obsessed with her.

934
00:56:42,648 --> 00:56:44,048
What about Cissy?

935
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:45,550
Oh, I'm trying to move on
from my ex-wife.

936
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:46,601
As am I.

937
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,320
What does that mean?

938
00:56:48,354 --> 00:56:52,574
It means I am trying to move on
from my ex-wife, also.

939
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,576
Oh.

940
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,528
Yeah.

941
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:58,780
I was hoping
you could fix me up.

942
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:01,616
With Thelma? That would assume
she wants to go out with you.

943
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,668
You know the only reason that
she works here selling cars

944
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:05,503
is so she can sing
in a club at night.

945
00:57:05,538 --> 00:57:07,539
Do you think I
should go down there?

946
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:09,090
I wouldn't do that, Hasty.

947
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,241
No, you're right.

948
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:11,909
She'll think
I'm coming on too strong.

949
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,528
Might even consider it
sexual harassment.

950
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,349
No, I think what
I'm gonna do is,

951
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:19,801
I am gonna sit back,

952
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:22,771
I am gonna bide my time,

953
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,590
play it cool.

954
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:26,591
Why do you do that?

955
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,760
It's who I am.

956
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,528
So,

957
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:32,981
do you think he was mixed up
in something illegal?

958
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,399
That's the second time
you've said that.

959
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:35,767
And could you turn
that thing off?

960
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:36,901
Come on, Jesse.

961
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:38,536
The way he was killed
makes it look

962
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:40,038
like he was mixed up
in something.

963
00:57:40,072 --> 00:57:43,575
Exactly. It makes it <i>look</i> like
he was mixed up in something.

964
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:45,660
Clearly, State Homicide
is holding back information.

965
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:47,078
Carter Hansen

966
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:48,163
said the same thing.

967
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,664
They always hold back
information.

968
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:50,966
Well, what do you know?

969
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:54,135
Okay, what I know is

970
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,304
that Hansen's gonna
get rid of you, Jesse,

971
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,256
as soon as he finds
somebody else.

972
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,891
I do not have a problem

973
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:01,426
with Hansen, nor he me.

974
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,144
How'd you know?

975
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,562
What?

976
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:06,765
About the bombing.
He said you already knew.

977
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,066
Why would State

978
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,384
Homicide call you and not

979
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:10,819
the rest of the town council?

980
00:58:10,853 --> 00:58:11,987
No, they didn't.

981
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,271
Look, Hansen was in shock.

982
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,440
All I knew was that
something was wrong

983
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:16,992
as soon as I heard his voice.
No, he's just confused.

984
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:20,362
I'm sorry, Hasty.
It's just the cop in me.

985
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,248
He's pretty beat up by this.

986
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,916
Was Butler working on something?

987
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,819
Nothing I can find.
Does 2A-H-10

988
00:58:27,853 --> 00:58:29,037
mean anything to?

989
00:58:29,071 --> 00:58:31,122
It just sounds like
some kind of code.

990
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:32,957
He-He was very
secretive.

991
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:34,175
In fact, he was

992
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,293
worse than you.

993
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,295
Now, I can help you
with his laptop. I know

994
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:38,680
you're computer-
illiterate.

995
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:41,049
I prefer Luddite, and it was
destroyed in the explosion.

996
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,468
That's a serious blow
to the investigation.

997
00:58:43,502 --> 00:58:44,769
Look,

998
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:45,970
I know I owe you, Hasty.

999
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:47,939
You gave me the job
in the first place.

1000
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:49,858
So, here's what
I can tell you.

1001
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,860
I'm the only cop
who thinks he wasn't dirty.

1002
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:53,812
The killer knew
that Butler was going to be

1003
00:58:53,846 --> 00:58:55,697
on the Beach Road
and where he was going.

1004
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:57,649
Someone's
following me around.

1005
00:58:57,683 --> 00:59:01,152
And something's gonna happen
on the 24th.

1006
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:03,788
What's going to happen
on the 24th?

1007
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:07,008
That is something I do not know.

1008
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,861
I can help you with this.

1009
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,164
I'm very fond
of you, Jesse.

1010
00:59:22,888 --> 00:59:25,005
(sighs)

1011
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:31,502
Hello, Amanda.

1012
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:32,787
Hello, Jesse.

1013
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:34,839
You remembered my name.
You're on the list.

1014
00:59:34,873 --> 00:59:37,008
Your list?
Mr. Fish's list.

1015
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:40,511
Can I ask you something?
Do I have a choice?

1016
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:42,913
You called me by my first name.
That's not a question.

1017
00:59:42,931 --> 00:59:45,716
That's not a question, Jesse.
Jesse.

1018
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,184
I know
that's not a question, Amanda.

1019
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,919
What was your question?
Jesse.

1020
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:52,223
What was your question, Jesse?

1021
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:55,726
I know you're shy and afraid
to break the ice, so I'll start.

1022
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,278
Could I see you sometime?

1023
00:59:57,312 --> 00:59:58,613
No.

1024
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:00,314
I see.

1025
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:02,400
Actually, that was only part
of my question.

1026
01:00:02,434 --> 01:00:04,602
I'm sorry. Was I rude?
No.

1027
01:00:04,636 --> 01:00:05,736
You were direct.

1028
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,121
I like direct.

1029
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:10,107
Can I see you sometime,

1030
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,493
and would you walk over
to that door and punch me in?

1031
01:00:12,544 --> 01:00:14,111
Because?

1032
01:00:14,129 --> 01:00:15,463
Because I like watching you.

1033
01:00:15,497 --> 01:00:17,298
I'm too young for you.

1034
01:00:17,332 --> 01:00:19,400
I'm hurt.

1035
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,648
(beeping)

1036
01:00:33,682 --> 01:00:35,132
(clicks)

1037
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,094
Just coffee.

1038
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:54,669
STONE:
<i>Where are you taking me,</i>

1039
01:00:54,703 --> 01:00:55,870
Steven?

1040
01:00:55,921 --> 01:00:57,405
You came to
see Mr. Fish?

1041
01:00:57,439 --> 01:00:58,622
That's correct.

1042
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,541
I'm taking you
to see Mr. Fish.

1043
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:02,510
Is he in an underground bunker?

1044
01:01:02,544 --> 01:01:04,495
I hardly think so.

1045
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:06,514
You don't like me,
do you, Steven?

1046
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:08,683
I do not.

1047
01:01:13,221 --> 01:01:15,222
Wait here.
Jesse.

1048
01:01:15,273 --> 01:01:18,008
Wait here, Jesse.

1049
01:01:20,228 --> 01:01:22,363
(sighs)

1050
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,806
(sighs)

1051
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:43,834
(lighter clicks open)

1052
01:01:44,753 --> 01:01:47,254
Jesse Stone to see you, sir.

1053
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:01,068
Jesse Stone.

1054
01:02:01,103 --> 01:02:03,904
(silverware clinking)

1055
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,694
Hello, Gino.

1056
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:14,398
Oh, I see your PPD hat has found
its way back onto your head.

1057
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,867
This is H.

1058
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:18,452
Henry Uppman,
an associate.

1059
01:02:18,503 --> 01:02:21,205
Jesse Stone
is from Paradise.

1060
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,957
He's the temp police chief.

1061
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:24,208
Just chief.

1062
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:25,209
Oh, congratulations.

1063
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:26,794
Thank you.
Obviously,

1064
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,245
I heard about your former chief.

1065
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:30,047
It was a horrible tragedy.

1066
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:32,266
His name was William Butler,
and he was murdered.

1067
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,301
I see. Is that why you're here?

1068
01:02:34,352 --> 01:02:36,971
Well, we haven't visited
in a while.

1069
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:39,807
And I've missed
our little chats.

1070
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:41,892
I'm sorry. I was busy.

1071
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:43,060
Doing what, Jesse Stone?

1072
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:44,595
Being preoccupied.

1073
01:02:44,613 --> 01:02:47,031
And why are you wearing the hat,
Jesse Stone?

1074
01:02:47,065 --> 01:02:49,567
Because I missed it.

1075
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:52,269
I'm afraid
I have more sad news, Gino.

1076
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:55,906
Would you remember a former
employee named James Thompson?

1077
01:02:55,941 --> 01:02:58,409
I know of no such person.

1078
01:02:58,443 --> 01:03:00,878
Perhaps you remember him
as Jimmy.

1079
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:02,696
I know of no such person.

1080
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:04,431
Why do you ask?

1081
01:03:04,466 --> 01:03:07,334
Jimmy hanged himself yesterday.

1082
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:10,671
How sad.

1083
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:12,590
So, this is an official visit?

1084
01:03:12,624 --> 01:03:15,792
In a let's-get-reacquainted
sort of way.

1085
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:18,813
Mr. Fish will not be answering
any more of your questions.

1086
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,517
How sad.

1087
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:25,519
It was nice seeing you

MAN: Some kids have started a bonfire

<i>What were you thinking?</i>

1100
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:34,648
Excuse me?

1101
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,067
What were you thinking
when you asked me out?

1102
01:05:37,101 --> 01:05:39,153
I didn't ask you out.
I asked

1103
01:05:39,204 --> 01:05:40,821
if I could see you sometime.

1104
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:41,938
And the difference would be?

1105
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:43,123
Rules.

1106
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:44,441
Excuse me?

1107
01:05:44,459 --> 01:05:47,110
The rules between a meeting
and a date are different.

1108
01:05:47,128 --> 01:05:48,979
And this would be...?

1109
01:05:49,014 --> 01:05:49,964
This would be a meeting.

1110
01:05:49,998 --> 01:05:51,999
I'm too young for you.

1111
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,701
You mean I'm too old for you.

1112
01:05:53,735 --> 01:05:55,469
Not necessarily.

1113
01:05:55,503 --> 01:05:56,620
That was kind.

1114
01:05:56,638 --> 01:05:58,172
I didn't mean
it to be.

1115
01:05:58,223 --> 01:06:00,007
It was direct.

1116
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:00,841
I see.

1117
01:06:00,892 --> 01:06:02,176
No, you don't.

1118
01:06:02,227 --> 01:06:03,260
Okay.

1119
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:04,561
I'm not ready.

1120
01:06:04,596 --> 01:06:05,962
I see.

1121
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:07,965
Don't keep saying that--
because you don't see.

1122
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,183
Okay.

1123
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:11,685
The idea has always
appealed to me.

1124
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,070
I see.

1125
01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:14,521
I <i>do</i> see.

1126
01:06:14,572 --> 01:06:16,740
You're not ready.

1128
01:06:24,165 --> 01:06:26,867
Amanda, what's gonna
happen on the 24th?

1129
01:06:26,918 --> 01:06:28,185
Nothing, Jesse.

1130
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:30,921
I have no plans.

1131
01:06:34,092 --> 01:06:35,542
Okay.

1132
01:06:40,715 --> 01:06:43,934
So, why did you ask me out?
Why do you want to know?

1133
01:06:43,968 --> 01:06:46,687
Because I've kissed
a few frogs in my day.

1134
01:06:48,673 --> 01:06:50,024
I see.

1135
01:06:50,058 --> 01:06:51,725
You make me curious.

1136
01:06:51,776 --> 01:06:52,476
About...?

1137
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:54,111
About you.
Good.

1138
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:55,396
I like curious.

1139
01:06:55,447 --> 01:06:57,180
So, do you like working
in the field

1140
01:06:57,198 --> 01:06:59,066
of boxing?
Yes. I like men.

1141
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:03,737
Okay. Is that all you do
for Mr. Fish?

1142
01:07:03,788 --> 01:07:05,606
I'm his executive assistant.

1143
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,990
In the boxing business?

1144
01:07:07,025 --> 01:07:08,125
In the boxing business.

1145
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,877
Must be nice
working for the boss.

1146
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:13,380
It is.
Although Mr. Fish has a boss.

1147
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,469
Mr. Fish has a boss?

1148
01:07:18,503 --> 01:07:20,337
I just said that.

1149
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,058
And who would the boss be?

1150
01:07:24,092 --> 01:07:25,642
I don't know.

1151
01:07:25,677 --> 01:07:27,644
I've never seen him.

1152
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:29,847
Clearly, this isn't about me.

1153
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,554
What happens
on the 24th?

1154
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:40,056
I don't know.
You don't know

1155
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:41,725
or you won't tell me?

1156
01:07:41,743 --> 01:07:43,227
Does Gino Fish

1157
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:44,661
have a boss?

1158
01:07:44,696 --> 01:07:47,164
He's the sole owner
of GF Boxing Promotions,

1159
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,865
and he runs the show
on his dark side,

1160
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:50,667
and he didn't do it.

1161
01:07:50,668 --> 01:07:52,936
Is that a guess or a hunch?

1162
01:07:52,971 --> 01:07:54,288
He has an ironclad alibi.

1163
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:56,206
What'd he say?
He didn't.

1164
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,241
His lawyer informed us.

1165
01:07:58,259 --> 01:08:01,345
H. Henry Uppman.
He's highly skilled

1166
01:08:01,379 --> 01:08:03,347
in the art of criminal defense.

1167
01:08:03,381 --> 01:08:04,715
Guy's a putz.
Because?

1168
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:06,717
Because he used to be
a prosecutor, and now

1169
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,935
he's a criminal
defense attorney.

1170
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:09,186
Did you pay Gino a visit?

1171
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,305
I did.

1172
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:16,860
My college boys are getting
nowhere with the laptop.

1173
01:08:16,895 --> 01:08:18,695
I think it's a total loss.

1174
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,948
(sighs)

1175
01:08:20,982 --> 01:08:23,266
I know he was on to something.

1176
01:08:23,284 --> 01:08:25,068
What?

1177
01:08:27,005 --> 01:08:28,689
Is this a hunch?

1178
01:08:28,723 --> 01:08:30,958
I got to make something happen.

1179
01:08:30,992 --> 01:08:33,911
Whose investigation
is this, Jesse?

1180
01:08:35,213 --> 01:08:37,748
I'm not sure that
was ever decided.

1181
01:08:37,782 --> 01:08:39,666
(sets mug down)

1182
01:08:41,336 --> 01:08:44,421
We're gonna go public with
some of this in the morning.

1183
01:08:44,456 --> 01:08:47,123
Maybe somebody'll
step forward.

1184
01:08:47,142 --> 01:08:49,143
I asked you to wait.

1185
01:08:49,177 --> 01:08:52,162
I never said I would, or could.

1186
01:08:53,014 --> 01:08:55,015
Guy's got a family.

1187
01:08:56,184 --> 01:08:58,118
I know that.

1188
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:24,361
I was right:

1189
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:26,162
you never hurry.

1190
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:28,331
You sing like an angel.

1191
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:30,968
Mm.

1192
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,355
Thank you, Jesse.

1193
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:38,692
You're way overqualified
for that joint.

1194
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:41,311
They let me sing.

1195
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,530
You ever want to wear
that underwear again

1196
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:48,285
in front of a grown man,
I'm your guy.

1197
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,704
You're different now that
you have your job back.

1198
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:53,040
Is that a good thing?
Ever since I've known you,

1199
01:09:53,074 --> 01:09:55,242
there was a part of you
that wasn't present.

1200
01:09:55,293 --> 01:09:56,960
And now?

1201
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:58,361
There's a smaller part.

1202
01:09:58,379 --> 01:10:00,130
You love being a cop.

1203
01:10:00,164 --> 01:10:02,049
I do.

1204
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,967
Why'd you come to Paradise?

1205
01:10:04,002 --> 01:10:05,651
You haven't asked
me that before?

1206
01:10:05,676 --> 01:10:06,837
I'm not cruel.

1207
01:10:06,838 --> 01:10:08,338
No, you're not.

1208
01:10:08,373 --> 01:10:10,891
Could be hurtful to ask
a cop who can't be a cop

1209
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:13,710
why he became the
Paradise police chief.

1210
01:10:13,728 --> 01:10:15,312
But you're curious?

1211
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:16,930
You make me curious.

1212
01:10:16,981 --> 01:10:19,733
Paradise was
my last stop.

1213
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:20,984
From?

1214
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:22,819
I got fired in L.A.
For?

1215
01:10:22,854 --> 01:10:25,355
Being drunk on the job.

1216
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:29,359
Your boss hired me.

1217
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:32,496
Thought you put him in prison.
I did.

1218
01:10:32,564 --> 01:10:35,916
He assumed that with my history,
I'd be manageable.

1219
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:37,034
But you're not.

1220
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:39,903
No, I'm not.
His ex-wife's

1221
01:10:39,938 --> 01:10:41,088
a real piece of work.

1222
01:10:41,122 --> 01:10:42,956
I have found that to be true.

1223
01:10:42,991 --> 01:10:44,407
She took him for everything.

1224
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:46,843
How'd he get the money
to start a used car business?

1225
01:10:46,878 --> 01:10:49,463
That is a question for which
I do not have the answer,

1226
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:50,714
and he is not forthcoming

1227
01:10:50,748 --> 01:10:51,932
when I mention it.

1228
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:53,416
Does he ever tell you

1229
01:10:53,434 --> 01:10:55,218
he's very fond of you?

1230
01:10:55,253 --> 01:10:56,737
Only when he
needs something.

1231
01:10:57,889 --> 01:10:59,923
This wasn't
easy to get

1232
01:10:59,941 --> 01:11:01,424
under the conditions
you specified.

1233
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:02,969
That no one knew
you were getting it?

1234
01:11:02,994 --> 01:11:04,361
Exactly.

1235
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:06,630
Do you want to know
why I wanted it?

1236
01:11:06,664 --> 01:11:07,814
No.

1237
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:09,032
Because...?

1238
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:11,685
You said don't ask.

1239
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:19,993
(sighs)

1240
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:23,880
I want to say something,
and I don't want to scare you.

1241
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:26,133
Fire away.

1242
01:11:27,302 --> 01:11:31,355
You helped me through
the hardest time in my life.

1243
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:39,346
♪

1244
01:12:10,044 --> 01:12:12,262
♪

1245
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,800
I was thinking of stopping by.

1246
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:19,136
You gonna be around later?

1247
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,804
Good.

1248
01:12:35,983 --> 01:12:37,550
Yes, the car's
in great condition.

1249
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,220
It hasn't been
in any accidents.

1250
01:12:39,944 --> 01:12:41,027
That's right.

1251
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,263
And the mileage
is very low.

1252
01:12:43,314 --> 01:12:47,234
Only 23,867.

1253
01:12:47,268 --> 01:12:48,569
And the original owner...

01:12:49,437 --> 01:12:51,605
HASTY:
Congratulations, Jesse,

1255
01:12:51,656 --> 01:12:53,240
you actually made
an appointment.

1256
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:55,275
(exhales)

1257
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:57,611
Thelma's in particularly
fine form today.

1258
01:12:57,662 --> 01:12:59,029
We need to talk, Hasty.

1259
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:01,164
Jesse, you
cannot afford

1260
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,167
one of my cars.

1261
01:13:04,202 --> 01:13:05,953
(sighs)

1262
01:13:06,004 --> 01:13:07,955
Oh. Sit down.

1263
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,392
So...

1264
01:13:12,427 --> 01:13:14,461
what's gonna happen on the 24th?

1265
01:13:15,597 --> 01:13:18,765
I thought getting my job back
would straighten me out.

1266
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,818
How is the drinking thing?

1267
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:25,138
I got wasted last night.

1268
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:27,590
Are you getting help?

1269
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,592
I'm not about to see a shrink.
Well, is there

1270
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:31,261
someone you can talk to
or confide in?

1271
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:33,647
I think you just got elected.

1272
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:35,932
Oh.

1273
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,702
I've been a cop
for a long time, Hasty,

1274
01:13:38,736 --> 01:13:41,154
and my gut's always
served me, but...

1275
01:13:41,205 --> 01:13:43,206
I have to apologize.

1276
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,574
For what?

1277
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:47,044
(sighs):
I'm just not...

1278
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:48,378
thinking right.

1279
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:49,963
You know, you were so persistent

1280
01:13:49,998 --> 01:13:51,999
about wanting to know
what I know,

1281
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,836
and you've never told me how you
got the money for this place.

1282
01:13:55,887 --> 01:13:57,754
You take two small
unrelated things,

1283
01:13:57,789 --> 01:14:00,674
find your dinner in a bottle of
scotch, and look what you get.

1284
01:14:00,725 --> 01:14:02,342
What do you get?

1285
01:14:02,393 --> 01:14:04,728
Well, somewhere
around my third drink,

1286
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:06,313
I had it all figured out.

1287
01:14:06,347 --> 01:14:09,433
When I busted you, you weren't
laundering money for Gino Fish.

1288
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:10,851
You just pled to it

1289
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:13,170
to cover up
something bigger.

1290
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:15,522
Did you keep drinking?

1291
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:16,521
I did.

1292
01:14:16,522 --> 01:14:17,318
And?

1293
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,077
The more I drank,
the more it made sense.

1294
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:23,030
You weren't working for Gino;
he was working for you.

1295
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:24,948
You were the boss.

1296
01:14:24,982 --> 01:14:27,367
<i>You</i> ran the
narcotics operation,

1297
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:28,985
even from prison.

1298
01:14:29,003 --> 01:14:31,655
And I felt it
with such certainty.

1299
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:34,541
And in the morning?

1300
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,345
All I felt was a headache.

1301
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:41,264
(laughing)

1302
01:14:41,299 --> 01:14:42,549
That's when I called you.

1303
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,019
Why are you
telling me all this?

1304
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:47,721
(sighs)
I owe you, Hasty.

1305
01:14:47,772 --> 01:14:51,274
Look, i-it was a crazy idea,
but, I don't know,

1306
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:53,360
somehow...

1307
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:56,063
it made me feel... disloyal.

1308
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:59,182
Oh.

1309
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,018
So for what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

1310
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:05,072
I'm very fond of you, Jesse.

1311
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:06,656
Thank you.

1312
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:08,625
I think I know
where this came from.

1313
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:10,544
Where would that be?

1314
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:13,880
Well, I couldn't face the fact
that a fellow cop was dirty,

1315
01:15:13,915 --> 01:15:16,633
that his drug deal went bad,
he knew too much,

1316
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:18,335
so...
Yeah.

1317
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:20,120
You've had a rough time.

1318
01:15:20,154 --> 01:15:23,056
Anyway... thanks for listening.

1319
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:26,009
Oh, good news.

1320
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:29,896
State Homicide thinks they found
a way into Butler's computer.

1321
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:32,049
They should have everything
by this evening.

1322
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:33,350
I guess...

1323
01:15:33,384 --> 01:15:34,851
it'll incriminate Butler.

1324
01:15:34,885 --> 01:15:37,104
It's gonna be hard
on his family.

1325
01:15:37,155 --> 01:15:39,389
Yeah. I'll walk you out.

1326
01:15:42,577 --> 01:15:43,726
Wait a minute.

1327
01:15:43,745 --> 01:15:46,513
Uh, Thelma-- come here--
you remember Jesse?

1328
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:47,897
I do.

1329
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:51,084
Thelma is in the process
of closing a very big deal,

1330
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:52,536
a Bentley Continental.

1331
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:53,920
Sweet!

1332
01:15:53,955 --> 01:15:55,122
Thanks, Hasty.

1333
01:15:55,173 --> 01:15:56,406
Nice seeing you, Thelma.

1334
01:15:56,424 --> 01:15:57,740
And you, Jesse.

1335
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:02,379
(sighs)

1336
01:16:02,413 --> 01:16:04,664
I'm very fond of him.

I know I'm not speaking
in a foreign tongue.

1340
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,548
The 24th is a no-go.

1341
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:40,750
Um, 6:00 tonight.

1342
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:43,286
No, I know
that daylight is a risk,

1343
01:16:43,304 --> 01:16:46,339
but risk is the price you pay
for opportunity, my friend.

1344
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,675
No, I don't want you
to tell them that.

1345
01:16:48,726 --> 01:16:50,644
Just tell them to be there.

1346
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,291
Let me get that
for you, Mr. Hathaway.

1347
01:17:21,325 --> 01:17:22,442
No, this stays with me.
Thank you, Hal.

1348
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,327
Will you be leaving us
for long, sir?

1349
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:25,828
Just a couple of days.

1350

A lot of luggage.

1351
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,131

if my business
gets complicated

1353
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,601
I may need to
extend my stay.

1354
01:17:31,636 --> 01:17:33,053
I would remind you
that it's...

1355
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:34,688
none of your
business, Hal.

1356
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:36,189

I told you it wasn't Butler.

Arthur Gallery,

1379
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:07,289
had no priors.

1380
01:25:07,308 --> 01:25:10,143
But he was
a person of interest in three

separate murders
in three different locations.

1382

if you'd given me a name.

01:25:15,733 --> 01:25:17,984

what do you call it?

1396
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:41,958
From day one, he always assumed
he was smarter than me.

1397
01:25:41,992 --> 01:25:44,544
So you knew
he planted the money.

I had a hunch.

1399
01:25:45,763 --> 01:25:48,014

there was certainty.

No.
