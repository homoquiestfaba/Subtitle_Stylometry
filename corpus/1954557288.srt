1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,342
WOMAN: Are you recording?

2
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,345
MAN: Hmm?
Are you recording?

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,783
Maybe.
Yeah, you are.

4
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,753
(FOLK MUSIC PLAYING)

5
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,079
NARRATOR 1: <i>Pardon</i>
<i>my interruption.</i>

6
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,982
<i>What you are about</i>
<i> to see is a short</i>
<i> film entitled</i>

7
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,483
How Would You Feel?

8
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:42,254
<i>Created by one</i>
<i>Terence Nance in 2006.</i>

9
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,557
How Would You Feel?
<i>is an educational film</i>
<i>that examines theories</i>

10
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:49,962
<i>about how humans</i>
<i>come to experience</i>
<i>a singular emotion.</i>

11
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,398
<i>In its original form</i>
<i>it was presented</i>
<i>as a work of fiction.</i>

12
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,835
<i>We will interrupt the fim</i>
<i>How Would You Feel?</i>
<i> from time to time</i>

13
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,772
<i>with a new film entitled</i>
<i>An Oversimplification</i>
<i>of Her Beauty.</i>

14
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,675
<i>We will do this in order</i>
<i>to provide the context</i>

15
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,777
<i>necessary to tell</i>
<i> a complete story.</i>

16
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,034
<i>So let's say that one day</i>
<i>you arrive at your home.</i>

17
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,036
<i>It has been a long day,</i>
<i> during which you have wod</i>

18
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,705
<i>no less than</i>
<i>12 consecutive hours.</i>

19
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,808
<i>This is in your case</i>
<i>a typical day.</i>

20
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,745
<i>However, this particulary</i>
<i> a young lady who you know</i>

21
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,814
<i>and a little more than like</i>

22
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:46,518
<i>has told you that</i>
<i> she is coming to be in</i>
<i> your company this evenin.</i>

23
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,254
<i>So as you empty your pocs</i>
<i> and begin to get settled,</i>

24
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,156
<i>you see that</i>
<i>she has telephoned you.</i>
<i> (VIBRATING)</i>

25
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:55,127
<i>Of course you</i>
<i>telephone her back.</i>
<i>She answers.</i>

26
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,562
<i>She tells you that</i>
<i>she has just arrived</i>
<i>at her own home</i>

27
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,631
<i>and won't be coming</i>
<i> to yours tonight.</i>

28
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,067
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>

29
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,502
<i>how would you feel?</i>

30
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,874
<i>Now let's say that</i>
<i>this particular day</i>
<i>began at 8:00 a.m.,</i>

31
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,444
<i>when you woke up too late</i>
<i> to arrive at your place</i>
<i> of employment on time.</i>

32
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,880
<i>Your daily commute</i>
<i>is no less than one hour.</i>

33
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:18,617
<i>Although you arrive on tim,</i>
<i>you are disappointed</i>
<i>in your inability</i>

34
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,452
<i>to awake yourself  consistently</i>

35
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,221
<i>in situations when</i>
<i>you are in a bed alone.</i>

36
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,726
<i>You are disappointed</i>
<i>because this disability speaks</i>
<i>to a lack of self-control.</i>

37
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,897
<i>Self-control that</i>
<i>you feel entitled to,</i>
<i>but do not possess.</i>

38
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,532
<i>The evening before</i>
<i> you worked late</i>

39
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:36,568
<i>and consequently</i>
<i>slept for only three hours.</i>

40
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,304
<i>And let's say that</i>
<i> you have no bed</i>
<i> and no money,</i>

41
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,107
<i>and a stubborn yet quixoc</i>
<i> do-it-yourself attitude.</i>

42
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,109
<i>So, you built your bed</i>
<i>in a wood shop</i>

43
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,812
<i>using Japanese wood</i>
<i> joinery techniques</i>

44
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,114
<i>that you learned</i>
<i>from a book you</i>
<i>found in the garbage.</i>

45
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,683
<i>You possess no means</i>
<i>of personal transportation,</i>

46
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,852
<i>so you elected</i>
<i>to transport this bed,</i>

47
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,288
<i>piece by piece,</i>
<i>on the train ride home,</i>

48
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,156
<i>rushing yourself</i>
<i> because you expected</i>

49
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,759
<i>to be in the company</i>
<i>of this lady quite soon.</i>

50
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,928
<i>After all, she has told you</i>

51
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,597
<i>she would be in your</i>
<i>company this evening.</i>

52
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,200
<i>So, you empty your</i>
<i>pockets, get settled,</i>

53
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,737
<i>and notice you have</i>
<i>missed her call.</i>
<i>You call her back.</i>

54
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,606
<i>She tells you</i>
<i> she has just arrived</i>
<i> at her own home</i>

55
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,728
<i>and won't be</i>
<i>seeing you tonight.</i>

56
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,646
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>

57
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,816
<i>how would you feel?</i>

58
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,489
<i>Now, let's just say</i>
<i>that over the span</i>
<i>of four to eight weeks,</i>

59
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,925
<i>this young lady</i>
<i> has become a very</i>
<i> good friend of yours.</i>

60
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,561
BOTH NARRATORS:
<i>This friendship is platoni.</i>

61
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,464
NARRATOR 2: <i>Let's say that</i>
<i> you are attracted to her.</i>

62
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:43,535
<i>You do not know</i>
<i> if she, in the deep</i>
<i> recesses of her soul,</i>

63
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,738
<i>harbors any amorous</i>
<i>feelings for you</i>
<i>as you do for her.</i>

64
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,675
<i>But when parting from</i>
<i>each other's presence,</i>

65
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,145
<i>she lightly kisses you</i>
<i>on your lips.</i>

66
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,115
<i>Seldom, but with intenti,</i>

67
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,485
<i>and a hint of mischief</i>
<i>and doubt opaque</i>
<i>in her pupils.</i>

68
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,956
NARRATOR 1: <i>Let's say</i>
<i> you and this lady friend</i>
<i> have slept together</i>

69
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:08,360
<i>on between four</i>
<i>and 18 occasions.</i>

70
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:12,931
<i>And by "slept together"</i>
<i>I mean just that, sleeping.</i>

71
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,636
<i>Each occasion occurs</i>
<i>in either one of</i>
<i>your full-sized beds.</i>

72
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:21,473
<i>Each time you</i>
<i>share a bed, you grow</i>
<i>closer physically,</i>

73
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,595
<i>until you cannot</i>
<i>get any closer.</i>

74
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:30,615
<i>And let's say that</i>
<i>this growth seems</i>
<i>mutually fulfilling.</i>

75
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,486
<i>It is gentle, subtle,</i>
<i> but fortunately it is</i>
<i> accelerating in intensit.</i>

76
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,792
<i>Of course, each</i>
<i>morning after and for</i>
<i>varying lengths of time</i>

77
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,994
<i>during the days between</i>
<i>these encounters...</i>

78
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:46,565
NARRATOR 2: <i>...you daydream</i>
<i>about this most enigmatic</i>
<i>of connections.</i>

79
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,235
<i>You allow the taste</i>
<i>of your time together</i>
<i>to linger in your mouth</i>

80
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,137
<i>and coat your hands.</i>

81
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,972
<i>You think of the food</i>
<i> you cook together</i>

82
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,675
<i>and the way her navel</i>
<i>feels against your fingert.</i>

83
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,344
<i>A sweetness prevails.</i>

84
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>Today, during</i>
<i>your frustration with</i>
<i>your bed, your income,</i>

85
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,482
<i>and your commute,</i>

86
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,418
<i>you found respite</i>
<i>in the fact that</i>
<i>on that particular...</i>

87
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,689
NARRATOR 1: <i>Evening you</i>
<i> would have the opportuniy</i>
<i> to be in her company.</i>

88
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,259
<i>You would have been</i>
<i>uplifted by just the thougt</i>
<i>of spending this time</i>

89
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,894
<i>with this woman.</i>

90
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,129
<i>The night before</i>
<i>you are to meet</i>
<i>this young lady,</i>

91
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,065
<i>you dream a dream</i>
<i> that you remember.</i>

92
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,567
<i>Seldom do you</i>
<i>remember your dreams.</i>

93
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:25,637
<i>In this dream you ascend</i>
<i>above your existence</i>

94
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,641
<i>and shed among other</i>
<i>things a Western</i>
<i>understanding of time.</i>

95
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,676
<i>You meet her in a sky.</i>

96
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,646
<i>She has taken</i>
<i>the form of a sun,</i>
<i>but does not emit heat.</i>

97
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,114
<i>You ask for the time.</i>

98
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,284
<i>She refers you to</i>
<i>a moon who unfortunately</i>

99
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,654
<i>does not have the same</i>
<i>gravitational pull as she.</i>

100
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,624
<i>You fall from the sky</i>
<i> and are awakened</i>
<i> by your alarm</i>

101
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:48,994
<i>too late to arrive at yor</i>
<i> place of employment on t.</i>

102
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,595
<i>Let's say that</i>
<i> this frustrates you</i>

103
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,332
<i>because it evidences</i>
<i>a lack of self-control.</i>

104
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:58,036
<i>You also overslept</i>
<i>because in an exercise</i>
<i>in self-discipline,</i>

105
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,005
<i>you worked much</i>
<i>later than usual,</i>

106
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,641
<i>attempting to meet</i>
<i>your daily income quota.</i>

107
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,580
<i>After work you finished</i>
<i>the remaining pieces</i>
<i>of your bed.</i>

108
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,216
<i>Incidentally,</i>
<i>the bed did not fit</i>
<i>together quite right</i>

109
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,485
<i>because you are not</i>
<i>a very good carpenter,</i>

110
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,187
<i>nor do you read Japanese.</i>

111
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,557
<i>When you brought</i>
<i>it home, you stood</i>
<i>on the train platform</i>

112
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,927
<i>and watched</i>
<i>three full trains pass...</i>

113
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,162
NARRATOR 2: <i>...each</i>
<i>more full than the next.</i>

114
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,932
<i>People pushed themselves</i>
<i>against each other.</i>

115
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,602
<i>You imagined a collective</i>
<i> amorous feeling</i>
<i> floating in the air,</i>

116
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:34,573
<i>even though there</i>
<i>wasn't enough room</i>
<i>for you and your bed.</i>

117
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:38,743
BOTH NARRATORS: <i>Still, you</i>
<i> rushed yourself home, wih</i>
<i> this woman in your head.</i>

118
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,225
NARRATOR 1: <i>And as you</i>
<i>get settled, you see that</i>
<i>you have missed her call.</i>

119
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,617
Hello.
<i>You call back.</i>

120
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,386
<i>She says that</i>
<i>she has just arrived</i>
<i>at her own home</i>

121
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:51,388
<i>and will not be</i>
<i> seeing you tonight.</i>
<i>(INAUDIBLE)</i>

122
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,594
<i>Now at that moment,</i>
<i>given the circumstances,</i>

123
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:00,098
<i>how would you feel?</i>

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,969
<i>Now, let's say that</i>
<i>in life you are not</i>
<i>chronically lonely...</i>

125
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,339
NARRATOR 2: <i>...but the vast</i>
<i> majority of your days and</i>
<i> nights are spent alone.</i>

126
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:11,176
<i>All the same usually,</i>
<i>because you are very busy.</i>

127
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,111
<i>Busy with finishing</i>
<i> your education...</i>

128
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,813
NARRATOR 1: <i>...so that</i>
<i>you can finish</i>
<i>knowing who you are,</i>

129
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,948
<i>so that you can finish</i>
<i>with those years in life</i>

130
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,516
<i>during which you have</i>
<i>no clear answer</i>

131
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,784
<i>to the question...</i>

132
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,746
NARRATOR 2:
<i>"What do you do?"</i>

133
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,558
NARRATOR 1: <i>Generally</i>
<i> speaking, with</i>
<i> a few notable exceptions,</i>

134
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,226
<i>those that desire  your company</i>

135
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,528
<i>do not interest you</i>
<i>in a way</i>
<i>that would provoke you</i>

136
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,498
<i>to set aside time</i>
<i> to engage them.</i>

137
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,737
<i>Those that do interest y,</i>
<i> those for whom you would</i>
<i> manufacture time,</i>

138
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,272
<i>do not live in your vicinity,</i>

139
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,944
<i>or do not seem</i>
<i>so interested in you</i>
<i>as you in them.</i>

140
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,520
<i>And let's say that a womn</i>
<i> who you are presently</i>
<i> in love with</i>

141
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,657
<i>has decided</i>
<i>to enter an exclusive</i>
<i>romantic relationship</i>

142
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,825
<i>with someone</i>
<i> who provides for her</i>

143
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,862
<i>the stability and maturity</i>
<i>that you cannot.</i>

144
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,563
<i>You marvel</i>
<i> at the contradiction</i>

145
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,166
<i>between the intensity</i>
<i> of your love for her</i>

146
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,303
<i>and your in ability</i>
<i> to accurately express</i>
<i> this same love.</i>

147
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,040
<i>You wonder aloud</i>
<i> when you will grow diffet</i>

148
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,908
<i>and occasionally</i>
<i>allow yourself to wallow</i>

149
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,377
<i>in this gingerly</i>
<i>debilitating self-doubt.</i>

150
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,184
<i>Now, let's say</i>
<i> that at this very moment,</i>

151
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,921
<i>you were introduced</i>
<i>to this young lady</i>
<i>by a mutual friend.</i>

152
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,791
<i>You quickly crafted a ren</i>

<i>You collaborated</i>

154
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,362
<i>You became good friends,</i>

155
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,231

161
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,588
<i>with the timbre and grace</i>

<i>Let's say that</i>

00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,569
<i>This care and concern,</i>
<i>possibly one-sided,</i>

166
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,338
<i>but at the least entertad</i>
<i> by her words and actions,</i>

167
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,341

174

176
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,702
<i>She directly tells you</i>
<i>that his charisma only kees</i>

177
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,539
<i>and he is thus forced</i>
<i>to compensate for this</i>

<i>Also, from both her complaints</i>

194

00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:06,102
(CAMERA CLICKS)
Of having exclusive,

special love.

618
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:12,108
So, the notion of
being able to love

619
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,544
or being romantically
involved with
more than one person.

620

But, nevertheless,
every single one
of them is special.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

625
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:30,326
As explained in the film,
especially that
conversation at the end,

626
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,230
it's just, like, really

627
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,532
a rumination on
how relationships

628
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,336
or how each relationship
is so intricately

629
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,418
defined by the
circumstances around it.

630
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,919
At times.

631
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,420
Nothing.

632
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:00,589
So...

633
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,593
No, I felt
uncomfortable because

634
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,699
certain private

635
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,671
interactions were publicized,

636
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:21,444
and mainly from
one point of view.

637
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:25,681
If we both got to have
our little commentary,

638
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,411
a little dual-screen
action,

639
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,554
it would have been
a different story.

640
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,757
And it's your film,
that's fine.

641
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,160
But it was like my life
put on screen to

642
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,230
your music.

643
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,740
It's apparent to me that

644
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,176
you make movies
about your life.

645
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,612
No, everyone doesn't.

You feel bad?

647
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:08,924
That's true.
The only problem is that

648
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,993
your truth will never
make you feel bad.

649
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,995
Hopefully.

650
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,198
But it's definite.
It's a definite fact that

651
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,900
everyone has their own truths.

652
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:21,237
And that's
the eternal cause
of conflict,

653
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,938
and it's not really negotiable.

654
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,142
Like, everyone sees
the world through
their own eyes,

655
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:29,945
so to see it through
someone else's eyes,

656
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,914
but still have it
be an experience that

657
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:34,917
you remember is
a jarring experience
sometimes

658
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,853
if it doesn't coalesce
into my truth.

781

785
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:21,837
<i>she fell out of love.</i>

786
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,039
<i>Maybe not so much</i>

<i>And she was with him.</i>
<i> And she was with him.</i>

792
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:38,587
<i>And she was with him.</i>
<i>And she was with her.</i>

793

<i>And you were with this movie.</i>

796
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:52,868
<i>So, in March of 2006,</i>
<i> you made the movie.</i>

797
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,537
<i>A shorter version</i>
<i>of it that did not</i>

NARRATOR 2:
<i>...that it was true.</i>

799
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,382
<i>You showed volumes</i>
<i> one through three,</i>
<i> to be exact.</i>

800
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,179
<i>You did not tell her</i>
<i>that the film was</i>
<i>about you and her</i>

801
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:05,914
<i>when you all  were making it,</i>

802
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:09,117
<i>but you thought</i>

803
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,087
<i>When you screened</i>

<i>100 people,</i>

804
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,890
<i>they did not know that</i>
<i>the film was a retelling</i>

805
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,858
<i>of the story of you and her.</i>

806
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,721
<i>You hoped only</i>
<i> she would notice.</i>

807
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,558
<i>That the film</i>
<i> would talk to her.</i>

808
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,209
NARRATOR 1:
<i>And only her.</i>

01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:34,176
<i>The following letter was</i>

810
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:37,179
<i>It was written and sent</i>
<i>a few weeks after</i>
<i>the screening of</i>

How Would You Feel?

TERENCE: <i>June 14th,</i>
<i> 2006, 5:27 p.m.</i>

815
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,661
<i>Remember how you</i>

<i>this new guy</i>

816
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:55,063
<i>that you are dating</i>
<i> in Union Square?</i>

817
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,265
<i>Well, he must be</i>
<i>very lucky, 'cause</i>

818
01:03:57,267 --> 01:04:00,902
<i>I'm in Union Square</i>
<i>right now, and</i>
<i>I'm here pretty often,</i>

819
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:04,105
<i>and I never see</i>
<i>anybody like you.</i>

820
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:07,275
<i>I guess I spoke too soon,</i>
<i>'cause she looks amazing,</i>

821
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:10,312
<i>but, alas, there are</i>
<i>"too many in the wolf pack"</i>
<i>as they say.</i>

822
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:14,182
<i>Anyhow, on to the chase.</i>

823
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,386
<i>I am writing this letter</i>

824
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:23,091
<i>to tell you that I have e</i>

825

<i>And before, you know,</i>
<i> you were in a relationshp</i>
<i> and everything,</i>

826
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,631
<i>me being in love with you was</i>

827
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:32,300
<i>as much a source of angst</i>
<i>as it was pleasure.</i>

828
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:36,137
<i>But now I feel...</i>

829
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,140
<i>I feel...</i>

830
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,729
<i>I feel fortunate,</i>
<i>the word is "fortunate"</i>

831
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,340
<i>I feel fortunate</i>
<i>that I love you.</i>

832
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,986
<i>And it's a relief because</i>
<i> I don't have to worry abt</i>

833
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:52,921
<i>things that</i>
<i>I used to worry about.</i>

834
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,624
<i>Things like sucking</i>
<i> on your lip too long,</i>

835
01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:58,186
<i>or being at your houe</i>
<i> certain times of nig.</i>

836
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,997
<i>I have a new freedom,</i>
<i> I guess.</i>

837
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,100
<i>It's a new</i>
<i>and welcoming freedom.</i>

838
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:10,171
<i>And freedom even at</i>
<i> its least intense is stil</i>

839
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:12,340
<i>powerfully sensual</i>
<i> and exciting.</i>

840
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,322
<i>Do you remember that day</i>
<i> we were at the lounge</i>
<i> by your old apartment?</i>

841
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:29,324
<i>And we were talking</i>
<i>about high school,</i>

842
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:31,826
<i>and high school intimacy,</i>
<i>and whatnot?</i>

843
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:35,030
<i>And how there are</i>
<i>these little things</i>
<i>that our age has</i>

844
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:37,313
<i>rendered no longer excit.</i>
<i> You remember that?</i>

845
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,537
<i>Anyway, I was thinking ty</i>
<i> about the rare occasions</i>

846
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:45,307
<i>when I was lucky</i>
<i>enough to kiss a girl</i>
<i>in high school,</i>

847
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:49,110
<i>and how back then you knw</i>

848
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,753
<i>that kissing was as</i>
<i> intimate as it was</i>
<i> gonna get that night.</i>

849
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,519
<i>So kissing was more epic,</i>
<i>it was narrative.</i>

850
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,224
<i>Like at the beginning,</i>
<i>you're all scared,</i>

851
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,746
<i>so you peck around the rs</i>
<i> of each other's lips</i>
<i> and breathe all heavy,</i>

852
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:08,663
<i>and it's...</i>

853
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:12,901
<i>It was always</i>
<i>really funny to me that</i>
<i>people have a taste.</i>

854
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:17,238
<i>It's actually a kind of</i>
<i> scary thought because</i>
<i> if you taste a certain w,</i>

855
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:22,110
<i>then that means there has o</i>
<i>be some sort of predator</i>
<i>out there craving you.</i>

856
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,380
<i>I digress.</i>

857
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,916
<i>But the tasting is le</i>
<i> the story ending 'cae</i>

858
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:31,886
<i>their taste lingers</i>
<i>on your tongue. Anyway,</i>

859
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:35,056
<i>all that to say,</i>
<i>I am going to kiss you</i>
<i>like that.</i>

860
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,561
<i>You know how</i>
<i>at the end of letters</i>
<i>people always write,</i>

861
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:43,131
<i>"Love," then comma,</i>
<i>then their name?</i>

862
01:06:43,133 --> 01:06:45,800
<i>I don't like that</i>
<i>'cause when you use</i>
<i>the phrase, "Love</i>

863
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:47,669
<i>"comma Terence,"</i>

864
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:50,872
<i>who would really know</i>
<i>what kind of love</i>
<i>I'd be talking about?</i>

865
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,377
<i>Anyway, I'm gonna replace</i>

866
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:59,080
<i>the standard "Love" salutation</i>
<i>with my well-thought-out</i>
<i>definition of love,</i>

867
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,429
<i>just to make</i>
<i>my message more exact.</i>

868
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,723
<i>An art form slightly</i>
<i>removed from</i>
<i>its intended context,</i>

869
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,026
<i>Terence.</i>

870
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:36,051
NAMIK: <i>Terence, how is it</i>
<i>that you have come to</i>
<i>like so much this girl</i>

871
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:38,620
<i>that sits atop your bed</i>
<i>at night,</i>

872
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:42,557
<i>just sipping beer,</i>
<i>fighting the fatigue of</i>
<i>really hot summer nights</i>

873
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,826
<i>as her complaints trail y</i>
<i> into soft sighs?</i>

874
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,000
<i>As an astute observer of life,</i>

875
01:07:52,002 --> 01:07:56,371
<i>I always find it a slighy</i>
<i> odd yet intriguing idea</i>

876
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:59,140
<i>that a man's heart</i>
<i>can be warmed by my presen.</i>

877
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:05,080
<i>Self-hate or pure inquisition?</i>

878
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:08,082
<i>I may never be sure</i>
<i>of the source</i>
<i>of my disbelief.</i>

879
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,991
<i>Actually, I find</i>

880
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:20,995
<i>I hold my disbelief</i>
<i>so strong that sometimes</i>
<i>I subconsciously reject</i>

881
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,238
<i>the love beams</i>
<i> that are cast at me.</i>

882
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,246
<i>It's like an  invisible shield.</i>

883
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,305
<i>If I can't imagine why,</i>

884
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,043
<i>then just maybe</i>
<i>it doesn't really exist.</i>

885
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:38,213
<i>And if it doesn't exist then,</i>

886
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,215
<i>well, I don't really</i>
<i>have to do</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

887
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,490
<i>If friendship were</i>
<i>measured in how much</i>
<i>a person understands</i>

888
01:09:55,492 --> 01:09:59,327
<i>and accepts another,</i>
<i>then would that make you</i>
<i>my best friend?</i>

889
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:06,067
<i>I know, I know, it's</i>
<i>the word that every guy</i>
<i>hates and runs from.</i>

890
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:10,405
<i>"Friend." Ooh! What is</i>
<i>the state of a world</i>
<i>that runs from friends?</i>

891
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,976
<i>But</i>

892
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,498
<i>I think I might have</i>
<i> lost you in my world.</i>

893
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,815
<i>Follow the bright lights</i>

894
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:24,786
down the tunnel,
up to the seventh floor.

895
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,358
Now, there.

896
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,294
Terence.

897
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,864
I know you eagerly await
my response,

898
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,902
so here it is.

899
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:44,639
Because I love
the electrodes that
dance around your brain

900
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:47,942
and your relentless friendship

901
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:51,446
and understanding hands,
I will tell you.

902
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,818
As I come to know and
love myself, so will I you.

903
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,823
I am that I am, and one day,
I may love you, too.

904
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,468
NARRATOR 1: <i>Emotional memory</i>
<i> is your memory</i>

905
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:16,204
<i>of how you felt as opposed</i>
<i>to what happened.</i>

906
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:19,040
<i>You have been making</i>
<i>this movie on and off</i>
<i>for three years.</i>

907
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:22,243
<i>You no longer live</i>
<i>in the same city,</i>
<i>or know the same people.</i>

908
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:25,513
<i>You value different</i>
<i> things in life now.</i>

909
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:27,682
NARRATOR 2: <i>You know</i>
<i>that she has forgotten</i>

910
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,251
<i>The memory of</i>

911
01:11:30,253 --> 01:11:32,186

<i> a regrettable sin,</i>
<i> seldom enjoyed,</i>

912
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,422
<i>pushed away on</i>
<i>account of the guilt.</i>
<i>Or, more than likely,</i>

913
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,458
<i>your relationship</i>
<i>with her is a memory</i>
<i>so faint in the first plac,</i>

914
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:40,128
<i>it was not valuable</i>
<i> enough to keep,</i>
<i> to love as you have done.</i>

915
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,331
<i>You hope it is the latter,</i>
<i>if anything at all.</i>

916

<i>You have been making</i>
<i>this movie for</i>

918
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:54,175
<i>You are also starting to</i>
<i>forget how you felt.</i>

919
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:56,744
<i>Luckily, you are reminded</i>
<i>by the editing process,</i>

920
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,546
<i>which forces you to</i>
<i> look at her moving</i>

921
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:01,449
<i>in front of you, living often.</i>

922
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:04,052
<i>You think that</i>
<i>she has not forgotten</i>
<i>how she felt,</i>

923
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:07,555
<i>but in her maturity has</i>
<i>dismissed her feelings</i>
<i>toward you as juvenile.</i>

924
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:11,192
<i>The memory of the touch</i>
<i>of your lips may have</i>
<i>faded from her mind.</i>

925
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:14,062
<i>You are to her</i>
<i> a past attraction,</i>
<i> once enjoyed,</i>

926

<i>pushed away on account</i>
<i>of a new, more</i>

<i>First, that you are</i>

<i>Second, you are lonely,</i>

975
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:15,970

At the end of the day

Right?

1038
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:32,860
My heart

excited

1041
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,511
at the thought of him, and also

1042
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,714
very tenuous.

1043
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:53,380
Because when you walk into
a situation knowing that

1044
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:55,850
you're about to be hurt
at some point...

1045
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,654
It's a weird thing.
Like, why would you
logically do that?

1046
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,922
It doesn't make any sense.

1047
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,427
But I'm learning that
some things just can't

1048
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,196

get hurt with you.

I think...
What?

1054
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,583
You have a wandering heart.

1055
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:36,891
You don't get into
a relationship or not
based on

1056

the probability of a good
or bad thing happening.

1057
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:48,802
There is this emotional
impulse that I can't explain
or understand or control.

1058
01:21:48,804 --> 01:21:51,844
I hate it for that reason,
but I have to also
follow it because...
