1
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,240
What the hell
is wrong with you?

2
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,201
Where did you get this?

3
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,637
Where do you think
I got it?

4
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,248
Tacked up all over
the student union, you dick.

5
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,946
Can you give us a second?

6
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:46,731
You think I did this?

7
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:47,906
You took the pictures

8
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,430
in your room
after the Halloween party,

9
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:50,996
and you put
my phone number on it?

10
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,915
I've been getting
disgusting text messages

11
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,916
and voicemails all day.

12
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,309
I had to turn
my phone off.

13
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:00,745
This wasn't me, okay?

14
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,661
Maybe it was one of the guys
in the house of something.

15
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,272
I-I have no idea
who did this.

16
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,274
You are sick
and vindictive.

17
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,754
I'm going
to the Disciplinary Board.

18
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,322
No. No.
Laura, stop!

19
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,845
Give me the pass code
to your phone

20
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,238
so I can delete
all the pictures...
No!

21
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,326
...or get ready
to buy some rice.

22
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,762
I understand
that you are pissed off,

23
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,808
but you are seriously
over the line with this.

24
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,244
No.
I'm not.

25
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,811
Give me the pass code.

26
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,640
Fine. 3977.

27
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:35,954
Don't ever
talk to me again.

28
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,350
Laura!

29
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,929
Blocked.

30
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,887
Blocked.

31
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,369
You're totally blocked.

32
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,371
Goodbye.
You're blocked.

33
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,808
You're blocked.

34
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,655
Hey.

35
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,396
Hey.
Where have you been?

36
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,919
I thought we were
gonna watch a movie.

37
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,663
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,404
I was at Kappa Tau Pi.

39
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,797
Yeah.

40
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,668
Please tell me
you didn't confront Ben

41
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,280
about the photos
in front of people.

42
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:42,673
I told you
not to do that.

43
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,675
You have to play it off
like you don't care.

44
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,416
And besides, what if,

45
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,462
by some miniscule chance,
it wasn't him?

46
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,550
Jess, it was him.

47
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,465
Who else
would it have been?

48
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,466
I don't know.

49
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,076
Maybe he left his phone out

50
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,774
or stayed logged into
his computer or something.

51
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,821
No.
It was him.

52
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,866
And I docare.

53
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,477
He can't just get
away with this.

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,740
I mean, it used to be,
you broke up with someone

55
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,350
and you just move on.

56
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,352
Now you break up with someone,
and they have to destroy you.

57
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:10,832
He's clearly psycho.

58
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,487
Just be glad you're not
with him anymore.

59
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,359
I'll tell you what.

60
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,839
You go get changed

61
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:20,407
and I'll make us popcorn
with extra butter

62
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,887
and we'll watch "Dateline"
and rate guys on Tinder.

63
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,454
Sound fun?

64
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,022
Yeah.

65
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,166
You know what the worst thing is
about what Ben did?

66
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,472
What is this?

67
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,474
Your dad's actually
marrying her?

68
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,085
Yup.

69
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,567
And guess
who's the maid of honor.

70
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,003
You?

71
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,006
Just when you think
life can't get any worse.

72
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,139
I thought you guys
didn't even get along.

73
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,445
Why would she ask you?

74
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,708
We're civil,
and she's nice enough.

75
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,927
It's just hard
getting behind your dad

76
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,103
who's marrying somebody
20 years younger than him.

77
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,934
So, when is the big shindig?

78
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,894
Wait. The 14th.
That's during spring break.

79
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,548
Yup.

80
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,071
So, you're not
gonna be here?

81
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,551
No.

82
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,553
That sucks.

83
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,772
I was really looking forward
to partying with you,

84
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,818
especially now
that you're single.

85
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:27,822
There are going to be
so many beautiful men.

86
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,433
Yeah, well, I'm really
over guys at the moment.

87
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,000
Hot girls?

88
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,567
No.

89
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,177
That's your thing.

90
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,535
No, I'm --
I'm really looking forward

91
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,450
to spending
some time alone.

92
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,496
I mean, they're going
on their honeymoon
right after the wedding,

93
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,975
so I'm gonna have
the whole house by myself,

94
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,455
just me and Frisco.

95
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,023
That's super depressing.

96
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:57,895
No. You should fly back
and meet up with us.

97
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,897
Kayla's parents
are getting us a room

98
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,421
at the Daytona
Grand Vista.

99
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,554
Who's gonna take care
of my dog?

100
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,078
I'm sure there are
pet sitters in L.A.

101
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:10,038
Or ask a neighbor
or something.

102
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,518
Who's that?

103
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:15,173
Come in.

104
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,089
What are you doing here?

105
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,439
I want you
to stop telling people

106
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,831
I did something
that I didn't do.

107
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,920
How did you even
get in here?

108
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,749
There was a girl who came in,
so I snuck in behind her.

109
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:28,056
Look, I was thinking
about who might have done this,

110
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,100
and it could be Melanie.

111
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,928
The new pledge?

112
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,843
Yeah. You're always saying
that she's jealous of you.

113
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:35,019
She wouldn't have access
to your phone.

114
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:39,110
She did...that night
you dumped me.

115
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,982
You hooked up with her?

116
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,288
I was depressed.Get out.

117
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,160
No. I'm just saying
it could be her.

118
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,597
Get out now!
I'm gonna call campus security!

119
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,251
Fine.

120
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,828
Do you think
I should call Melanie?

121
00:08:00,871 --> 00:08:03,178
No. She's been doing
that internship thing.

122
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,094
She's been gone all week.
It couldn't have been her.

123
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:09,010
He's such a scumbag.

124
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,241
Hello?

125
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:25,113
Paul: Don't you
have to be up for work?

126
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,072
Not till noon.

127
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,074
Okay.
Well, I'll be quick.

128
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,554
Elise wants to know

129
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,296
if you took your bridesmaid
dress in to be altered.

130
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,255
No. I haven't even
tried it on yet.

131
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,953
Well, I need you
to do that soon.

132
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,868
The whole point
of sending it out to you

133
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,260
was so you could take it
to the tailor

134
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,001
to have it altered
if you needed to.

135
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:46,264
Yeah.
I'm sure it'll be fine.

136
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,049
And if it's too long,

137
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,094
I'll just ask Mona
to take it up or something.

138
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,575
I thought I told you
we fired Mona.

139
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,099
What?

140
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,144
Why?

141
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,275
Caught her stealing.

142
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,625
It's a long story.

143
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,540
Anyway,
we have a new housemaid.

144
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,976
Her name is Colleen.

145
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,021
She's very nice,
but I don't think she sews.

146
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:07,155
Dad, I got to go.

147
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,722
Um, there's somebody here.

148
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,899
Laura, my God,
you're right -- he's crazy.

149
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:12,987
What do you mean?

150
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,076
Pull up your profile.

151
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,037
Okay.

152
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,223
My God.

153
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,619
It won't let me delete it.

154
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,925
What a psycho.

155
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,669
Who are you calling?

156
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,757
Campus security.

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,715
This is too much.

158
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:09,043
Woman on P.A.: Dr. Morjari,
please return to pediatrics.

159
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,435
Good job.

160
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,089
Dr. Morjari,
please return to pediatrics.

161
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,743
You're doing so much better
than you did last week.

162
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,050
Laura, can I see you
for a moment?

163
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,008
Sure.

164
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,185
You can stop.
I'll be back, okay?

165
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,151
Um...

166
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,241
This is all lies...
all of it,

167
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,764
all of the stuff
about me driving drunk

168
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,679
and getting in a fight
with my sorority sisters.

169
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,420
None of it's true,
not a word.

170
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,161
Well,
do you have any idea

171
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,163
who would send me
something like this?

172
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,861
It's obviously intended
to ruin your reputation.

173
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,298
It's got to be Ben.

174
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:48,473
Ben?

175
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:49,866
Yeah.

176
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,174
He's this guy I dated
for a few months.

177
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,306
I reported him
to campus security this morning

178
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,743
for hacking my F.B. page.

179
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,180
I just broke up with him,
so it must be revenge.

180
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:01,356
Honey, I don't mean
to scare you,

181
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,706
but the last time
something like this happened,

182
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,753
it was an employee
who had just filed for divorce.

183
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,320
She ended up having to get
a restraining order

184
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,452
against her husband.

185
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,454
He was ruthless,

186
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:15,283
and he tried to cause problems
in every area of her life.

187
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:19,330
I urge you to take this e-mail
to the police.

188
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,773
Thank you, Ms. Olson.

189
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,735
I -- I don't want you
to think

190
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,345
that I'm the type of person

191
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,783
that gets involved
with these crazies.

192
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:39,263
This is all really
out of character for him.

193
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:42,136
This kind of thing
can happen to anyone,

194
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,225
but if someone is trying
to destroy your life,

195
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,793
don't make it easy
for them.

196
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,969
Thanks.

197
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,572
Woman:
You know, he's denying

198
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:28,965
any involvement
in the F.B. post

199
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,532
and the flyers
with your phone number.

200
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,229
Of course he is.

201
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:33,404
Well, the problem is,

202
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,797
we can't take
any disciplinary action

203
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,364
until we have proof.

204
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,583
I have asked Daytona Beach P.D.
to review the case,

205
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,934
especially since the e-mail
he sent to your boss

206
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,022
was defamatory.

207
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,545
Good. Thank you.

208
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,242
I'll keep you apprised.

209
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,374
I appreciate it.

210
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,942
Oy.

211
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,596
That was the head
of campus security.

212
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,294
She seems
pretty on top of it.

213
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,948
She told me
to temporarily take down

214
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,384
all my social-media pages.

215
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,473
It sucks that they can't
just suspend him.

216
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,780
He shouldn't even be allowed
anywhere near you.

217
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:04,305
Well, I'm about to put
a lot of space between us

218
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,785
in two more days.

219
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,967
Man: This is the senior editor.
How can I help you?

220
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,230
Colleen: I have a problem
with a proof you sent back.

221
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:17,971
The photo is --
it's -- it's wrong.

222
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:18,972
The color is wrong.

223
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,538
It's too orange.

224
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,584
That is not how he looked
in the original photo I sent.

225
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,455
I can ask them
to alter the tint.

226
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,284
Please.
It's important.

227
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,547
I can assure you
it won't look so orange.

228
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,985
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

229
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,988
No. Just --

230
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,555
Just make it look perfect, okay?

231
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,296
We will.

232
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,429
Are you okay, ma'am?

233
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,387
No.

234
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,999
No, I'm fine.
I just, um...

235
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,391
I have to go.

236
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:11,589
I hate her.

237
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:14,331
I hate her.

238
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,506
I hate her.

239
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,943
I hate her.

240
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,248
I hate her.

241
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,902
I hate her!
I hate her!

242
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:21,338
I hate her!
I hate her!

243
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,601
I hate her!
I hate her!

244
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,642
Look, I know you don't want me
to marry Elise.

245
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,385
No.
That's not true.

246
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,517
I want you to be happy.

247
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,519
I just wish it was someone
your own age.

248
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:13,086
I --
That's not fair.

249
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,479
And please don't minimize
what Elise and I have.

250
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:16,959
She's sweet and she's caring

251
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,395
and, yes,
I think she's beautiful, too,

252
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,962
but that's not
why we're getting married.

253
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:22,008
Really?

254
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:25,402
Why then?
What's -- What's the connection?

255
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,317
I guess the best way
for me to describe it is,

256
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:31,365
she brings out a side of me
that I like being,

257
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:33,976
and she's the first person
since your mother

258
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,630
that's been able
to do that.

259
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:40,678
Elise is excited
to have you in this wedding.

260
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:44,508
All I ask is that you realize
this is a big day for her.

261
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,075
Show her some attention.

262
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:49,078
Make her feel like
she's a part of the family.

263
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,603
I want this to be
the happiest day of her life.

264
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:56,781
Well, is it
the happiest day for you?

265
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,479
Or was that the day
that you met Mom?

266
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,046
Neither, actually.

267
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,613
It was the day
you were born.

268
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,702
It was.

269
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,356
There's this joy
that comes along

270
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,010
with holding your child
for the first time

271
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:11,405
that's unlike
anything in this world.

272
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,015
It changes you
as a person.

273
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,625
Okay, Dad.

274
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:17,672
I'll be a good bridesmaid
okay?

275
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,457
I promise.

276
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:23,721
Okay.

277
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,145
Frisco?

278
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,843
Hi! Hi, puppy.

279
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,541
Hi. Hi. Hi.

280
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,064
So good to see you.

281
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,371
Paul:
Hey, there.

282
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,460
Hi, honey.
You're here early.

283
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,593
Yeah.
What you doing?

284
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,682
Laura, sweetie!

285
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,075
Laura: Hi.

286
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,598
Hi!

287
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,644
How was --
how was your flight?

288
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,646
It was fine.
Yeah?

289
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,517
Looks like
you've been cooking all day.

290
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,215
I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble.

291
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:25,827
No, not at all --
just salad and some pasta.

292
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,481
Paul:
Is something burning?

293
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,091
Damn it.

294
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,574
No!

295
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,750
I ruined them.

296
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,840
They look perfect.

297
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,668
I like mine crispy.
So does she.

298
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:44,628
30 minutes at 325.
I thought I did that.

299
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,155
Yeah?
Good. Yeah.

300
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,771
Damn it.

301
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,557
Hi.
I'm Laura.

302
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,732
Colleen.

303
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,778
Nice to finally meet you.Yeah. You too.

304
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,475
I just finished
cleaning your room,

305
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,781
and there are fresh towels
in your bathroom.

306
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,088
Thank you so much.

307
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,574
I got that.
Thank you.

308
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,099
Thanks.

309
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,798
I've never seen so many utensils
used to make pasta.

310
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:26,235
I mean, what is the --
the meat thermometer for?

311
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:32,459
I'm glad you two
are hitting it off.

312
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,852
Did your dad tell you
why we had to fire Mona?

313
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,245
Mnh-mnh.

314
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,421
She was
robbing us blind.

315
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,467
But luckily,
a few days later,

316
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,903
I received an advertisement

317
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,861
from this maid-referral
service company,

318
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,299
and they sent
Colleen over.

319
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,778
It turns out
she used to work

320
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:49,737
at the same company
my father worked at.

321
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,652
Yeah. It's true.

322
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,654
I used to clean
her father's office.

323
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,308
Um, I never met him,
of course.

324
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,571
I hired her on the spot.
Isn't she great?

325
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,660
It sounds like
it was meant to be.

326
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:04,186
Laura, 
will you go put on your dress?

327
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,709
I'm dying
to see how it looks.

328
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,669
I've got this.
Go ahead.

329
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,280
I'll help her.
Go try it on.

330
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:14,588
Okay.

331
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,894
Where do these go?

332
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,729
My gosh.

333
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,601
You look gorgeous.

334
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,776
Thanks.

335
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,301
Actually, I do think
that needs to be taken in

336
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,911
a little bit
at the top, though.

337
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,787
Are you excited
about the wedding?

338
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,919
I'm happy for my dad,

339
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:45,793
you know, that he found
someone who makes him happy.

340
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,187
He does seem happy
with her.

341
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,625
How's that?

342
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:52,800
Is that better?

343
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,932
Yeah,
I think maybe, um --

344
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,196
maybe a little
tighter here, too.

345
00:19:58,371 --> 00:20:00,286
Do you have any kids?

346
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:04,812
I did. A son.

347
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,857
But he passed away.

348
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,773
I'm so sorry to hear that.

349
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,647
It was very hard
to lose him.

350
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,388
He was my life.

351
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,390
How did he die?

352
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,827
Car accident.

353
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,308
It was a hit-and-run.
They never caught the guy.

354
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,353
That's so terrible.

355
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,878
My mother died
in a car accident.

356
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,882
Both drivers were killed.
Both were at fault.

357
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,277
It's terrible
to lose someone you love,

358
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,061
especially
without warning.

359
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,802
Yeah.

360
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:41,327
I sometimes think
maybe it would have been better

361
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,763
if he'd been sick.

362
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,982
Then I might have
prepared myself for it.

363
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:49,509
And then again, it's better
for them if it's quick.

364
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,946
Well,
I think both ways suck.

365
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:55,515
You're right.
They do.

366
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,519
But in my son's case,
I have faith

367
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:03,784
that someday,
justice will be served.

368
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:07,091
Is that better?

369
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,964
Um, yeah.
I think that's perfect.

370
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,835
Great, all right,
well, take it off,

371
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:12,967
and I'll have it ready
for you tomorrow.

372
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,448
Thank you.

373
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:31,464
Woman: Hey, guys,
put the flowers on this table.

374
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,813
Man:
The runner's in the van.

375
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,380
Um, just bring the cake
over there.

376
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,946
Not too high.

377
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,389
Laura?

378
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,042
Hey.
Good morning.

379
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,958
This was left
on the porch for you.

380
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,439
It's from Daytona.

381
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,485
Great.

382
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,138
I don't understand.

383
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:58,099
It's my ex.
He's been, like, stalking me.

384
00:21:58,142 --> 00:21:59,840
Stalking you?

385
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,495
Yeah. Just a bunch of
cheap shots since we broke up.

386
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:06,368
I can't believe he would
send me something here...now.

387
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,372
I wonder what's in it.

388
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,547
Do you want me
to open it for you?

389
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:12,809
No.

390
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:14,507
It's probably
something awful.

391
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,552
Does your father know
about this?

392
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,380
No.

393
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,556
Why not?
I think he should know.

394
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,865
Um, it involves something

395
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,823
where Ben took a picture of me
while we were together

396
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:27,824
and...

397
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:30,087
I see.

398
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,394
It was, like,
the biggest mistake ever.

399
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,787
Everyone makes mistakes.

400
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,442
I'm sure your father
would understand.

401
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,140
It was me dressed
like a cat in lingerie.

402
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,968
No.

403
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:43,492
The police
are handling it.

404
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,146
Do you think that I should
forward it to them?

405
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,584
I tell you what --

406
00:22:48,628 --> 00:22:50,543
you need to put on a happy face
for the wedding.

407
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,022
Why don't I take this

408
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,155
and I'll put it
someplace safe for you

409
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:57,593
and tomorrow you can decide
what you want to do with it?

410
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,639
Yeah.

411
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,510
That's a good idea.

412
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,544
He looks so happy.

413
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,896
Thank you.

414
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,507
Yeah.

415
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,273
With this ring,

416
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:56,973
I, Craig Carter, promise
to be your loving husband,

417
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,366
to have and to hold

418
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:01,195
for as long
as we both shall live.

419
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,634
With this ring,
I, Laura Blackwell,

420
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:11,118
promise to be your loving wife
till death do us part.

421
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,001
It's not fair.

422
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,177
It's not fair.
It's not fair!

423
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,571
It's not fair!

424
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,669
Laura. Hey.

425
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,192
Matthew!

426
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,803
What --
What are you doing here?

427
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:13,327
I see your dad at the gym
every once in awhile,

428
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,069
and he told me that you were
gonna come to the wedding,

429
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,374
so I thought
I'd stop by.

430
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:22,075
Yeah -- Yeah, yeah,
these are for you, actually,

431
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:26,296
and this --
this is for them.

432
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,994
How -- How are you?

433
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:31,127
I feel like I haven't seen you
in like a year and a half.

434
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,434
Yeah,
I think the graduation

435
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:35,349
was the last time
we saw each other.

436
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:38,352
Um, what have
you been up to?

437
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:41,007
Not much.
Just school, work.

438
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,704
Yeah?Rehabbing the knee.

439
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,227
What happened
to your knee?

440
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,316
Pick-up basketball.
Don't worry about it.

441
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,796
How -- How's Florida?
Do you like it down there?

442
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,102
Yeah, it's great.
Yeah?

443
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:50,407
It's humid.

444
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,800
But I got
all the classes I wanted,

445
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,454
and, um, I got a part time job

446
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:56,326
at the children's hospital in
the physical-therapy department.

447
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,458
Really?
Yeah.

448
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,242
That's --
That's cool.

449
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,157
I can't believe
you're here.

450
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,420
Are -- Are you --
Are you glad I came by?

451
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,727
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

452
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,076
I just...

453
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,861
I just can't believe
you're here.

454
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,253
Why wouldn't I be?

455
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:12,125
I don't know.

456
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:13,866
I-I-I think I was just worried
that it might be awkward.

457
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,345
But y-you never know,
I guess.

458
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,304
Well, I guess it could have
been kind of awkward

459
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,175
if I had brought, like,
a date or something.

460
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:22,265
I knew you weren't, though,
'cause your dad told me.

461
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,138
I see.

462
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:27,401
You look great,
by the way.

463
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:31,318
Can I get you
something to drink?

464
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,407
Sure.
What are we having?

465
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,496
I was thinking champagne?

466
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,150
Bring on the bubbly.

467
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:38,368
Okay.

468
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,381
Who's your friend?

469
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:52,818
He's good-looking.

470
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,820
It's my ex -- Matthew.

471
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,386
Um, can I take these?

472
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,823
Yes.

473
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,520
Do you need me
to get you anything else?

474
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,913
No.

475
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,392
I'm okay. Thanks.

476
00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:14,361
I'll do it, Mom.
I'll do it.

477
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,755
What are you so happy
about today?

478
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,497
I have a date.

479
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,412
You do?

480
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,414
Well,
who's the lucky girl?

481
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:28,418
It's just a girl
from school.

482
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,421
Her name's Laura,
Laura Blackwell.

483
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:34,294
She goes to my school
and I asked her out on a date

484
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,774
and she's really pretty.

485
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,168
You -- You asked her,
and she said yes?

486
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:40,430
Yeah.

487
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:43,129
Today at lunch,
I asked her on a date,

488
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,260
and she said yes.

489
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:46,262
Really?

490
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,177
Well, when is this date
supposed to happen?

491
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,788
Saturday night.

492
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,965
We're gonna paint
the town red.

493
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,838
Where are you taking her?

494
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:01,625
I thought maybe here?

495
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,541
That way, I can show her
my comic books.

496
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:07,414
That's a good idea,
but what about

497
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:10,896
if you took her to dinner
and then a movie?

498
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,594
That's a great idea, Mom.

499
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,509
Dinner and a movie!

500
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,338
Laura likes movies --
I think.

501
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,557
I'm gonna go
look up movies.

502
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:23,604
You know
what I just thought?

503
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:26,433
I can take my comic books
to the movies.

504
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,956
You could do that.

505
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,872
This is gonna be great!

506
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:37,417
Man, it has been a long time
since I've been in this room.

507
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,464
You remember when my dad
came home early

508
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,075
and you had to hide
in the bathroom?

509
00:31:43,118 --> 00:31:45,686
I still have nightmares
about it.

510
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:47,427
Right.

511
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,343
Man. Okay.

512
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,735
Here. Look.

513
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,175
"Laura, Florida sucks.
Enjoy your summer. Matthew."

514
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,003
I mean, what --
what can I say?

515
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,700
I was bitter
about you leaving.

516
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,963
I mean, it's the whole reason
that we broke up.

517
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,661
We broke up because
you didn't want to pursue

518
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,707
a long-distance
relationship.

519
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:12,408
Yeah, well, I'm smarter now
than I was back then.

520
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:16,978
Cute smile.

521
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:18,414
Same one.

522
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,041
I-I better get going.

523
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,564
I-It's getting late,

524
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,653
and I -- I have work
tomorrow morning.

525
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,483
Um, yeah.

526
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,658
Yeah.

527
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,139
I will, um...

528
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,444
I'll walk you out.

529
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,185
Great.

530
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,655
Paul:
Morning, Colleen.

531
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,744
How does it feel
to be newlyweds?

532
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,224
Wonderful.

533
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,618
Even better once we're gazing
at the Mediterranean

534
00:33:31,661 --> 00:33:33,533
with sangrias
in our hands.

535
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,795
Well, you might want
to open this before you go.

536
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,057
It could be important.

537
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,798
All right.

538
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:45,588
Have a great trip,
you guys.

539
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:48,243
What the hell is this?

540
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,071
Who sent this?

541
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,073
My...

542
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:53,509
He did it again.

543
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,510
Who?

544
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:56,469
It's Ben.

545
00:33:57,731 --> 00:34:00,125
I let him take pictures of me
while we were dating

546
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,604
and then
I broke up with him

547
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,128
and he posted them
all over the campus.

548
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,607
Honey.

549
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,218
Why on Earth

550
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,089
would you let someone take
pictures of you like that?

551
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,264
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:10,744
I don't know.

553
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,833
I just -- We were --
We were drinking and having fun,

554
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,269
and I trusted him.

555
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,793
We were just being...
silly.

556
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,578
Silly?

557
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:20,449
This is what silly
gets you.

558
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:23,583
I've told you a million times
you can't trust these boys.

559
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,846
Paul, she already knows
she made a mistake.

560
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,152
I'm not letting this go.

561
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,457
I'm calling the police
right now.

562
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:31,112
Dad, no.
I already did that.

563
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,462
Campus security's on it,
and so are the Daytona police.

564
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:38,685
Just go, um -- Just go on
your trip and have fun.

565
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:41,166
And I'll let you know
if anything else happens.

566
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:44,256
It'll probably blow over
by the time you're back, anyway.

567
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,563
Is posting this picture
the only thing he's done?

568
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,783
Yeah.

569
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,219
Yeah.
That's it.

570
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:52,307
Okay.

571
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:56,703
Fine.

572
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:59,140
The number to the ship
is on the refrigerator.

573
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,708
My phone will work
once we get into Spain.

574
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,666
Call me if this
gets any worse.

575
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,667
I mean it.

576
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,234
Okay.
I promise.

577
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:09,585
I'm sorry this happened to you.
It'll all be okay.

578
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,152
Thanks.

579
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,505
Okay.

580
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,551
We're gonna have a much deeper
conversation about this

581
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,770
when we get back, okay?

582
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,772
Yeah. Yeah.

583
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,774
-Bye.
-Yeah. Bye.

584
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:26,646
-Bye.
-Bye.

585
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,178
Like you said,
it will blow over.

586
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:40,616
Yeah, I'm just -- I hate
disappointing my dad.

587
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,314
You know, he's right.

588
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:45,839
He's told me a million times,
"You have to protect your image.

589
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:50,757
People will take revenge in ways
you wouldn't even expect it."

590
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,281
Well,
people also make mistakes.

591
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,545
Some are big enough that
they deserve to pay forever,

592
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,635
like the person responsible
for my son's death,

593
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,942
and some
should be forgiven.

594
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:04,727
Yeah.

595
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,642
You're right.

596
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,210
I'll just never
make this mistake again.

597
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:12,648
I think we should open
that box.

598
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,824
Come on.
Okay.

599
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:29,274
This is getting
really spooky.

600
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,276
I don't know
why he hates me so much.

601
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,929
All I did
was break up with him.

602
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,584
Well,
he must have cared about you

603
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:37,586
more than
you even realized.

604
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,371
I can't imagine
someone doing this

605
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,634
unless you've really
broken their heart.

606
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,984
Are you saying it's, 
my fault he's stalking me?

607
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,681
No, no, of course not.

608
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,989
It's just, there's a lot
of passion behind this.

609
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,904
People don't normally
react that way

610
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:53,950
unless they've been
very wounded.

611
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,910
Or crazy.

612
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,433
I'm calling campus security

613
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,306
and letting them know about this
little gift he sent me

614
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,872
and that flyer
he sent to my dad.

615
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,787
I'm over it.

616
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,752
God.

617
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:18,845
I didn't request
to change my password.

618
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:22,327
Sorry, baby.

619
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:27,332
My God.

620
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:43,739
Matthew:
Hey. Good morning.

621
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,350
Hi.

622
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,830
What's wrong?

623
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,832
I need your help
with something.

624
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:54,446
Um...
I think I've been hacked.

625
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,974
I'm taking Elise's wedding dress
to the cleaners.

626
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,758
Do you want me
to take yours, as well?

627
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,412
Yeah. Yeah.
That'd be great.

628
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:06,588
It's on the -- It's on
the floor next to my bed.

629
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,288
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.

630
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,028
Yeah.

631
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:14,988
Stupid little bitch.

632
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,824
Somebody call
for a computer geek?

633
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:25,999
Laura:
Yeah.

634
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,092
So, some crazy guy
you were dating

635
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,485
changes your password,

636
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,008
Yeah.

637
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,882
I see you traded up.

638
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:42,798
Laura:
Ha, ha, very funny.

639
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,501
All right.

640
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:50,850
This it?

641
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:53,809
Okay.

642
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,942
Well, I should be able
to reset the password

643
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,379
either in recovery mode
or administrative mode.

644
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,773
And if not,
I did bring a disk in my car.

645
00:39:00,816 --> 00:39:02,383
Okay.

646
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,385
Let's see
what you can do.All right.

647
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:10,043
So, how did you meet
this vindictive guy -- Ben?

648
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,784
At an invite.

649
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,351
At what?

650
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,440
It's this thing
where a fraternity

651
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,443
invites an entire sorority over
for, like, a social event.

652
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:20,749
You're in a sorority? Why?

653
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,403
Yes.
Don't hate on the Greek life.

654
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:23,796
It's really not that bad.

655
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:24,927
Hey, I never hated on it.

656
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,364
You -- You did,

657
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,669
and I just laughed
and egged you on.

658
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,978
It's campus security.
Hold on.

659
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,414
Hello?Woman: Hi, Laura.

660
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,155
I see you called.
Is everything okay?

661
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,810
Yes, um, did you get
the picture of the coffin

662
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:38,811
that I sent to you?

663
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,160
I did.

664
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,161
And you think
he hacked your computer, too?

665
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,989
Right.

666
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,514
Okay, I'm having my boy--
I mean, um, my friend

667
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:48,560
reset the password
right now.

668
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:49,996
Okay. Hopefully
he can get that reset.

669
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,084
I'm noting everything.

670
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,478
Okay.
Okay?

671
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,481
All right. Yeah.
Thank you.

672
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,178
Sure thing.Okay, bye.

673
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,485
Coffin?

674
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,487
Yeah.

675
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,752
This was sent
yesterday.

676
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:10,843
It's wonderful.

677
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:13,802
Aww. He made you
into a cute little vampire.

678
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,979
No.
It's not funny.

679
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,460
He sent an e-mail to my boss
trashing me with a bunch of lies

680
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,941
and a flyer to my dad of
a picture of me in underwear.

681
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,551
Can I see this flyer?

682
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:26,162
No.

683
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:29,470
I really wish
he'd go away...really.

684
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:32,691
Sorry for making fun of it.

685
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:34,170
Maybe I should
fly down to Florida

686
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,171
and kick this guy's ass.

687
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:38,044
Yeah.

688
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,048
Frisco, hey.

689
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,266
Yeah.

690
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,269
Hey, do you want to go
for a ride?

691
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,662
You want to go for a ride?

692
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,577
Yes! I do, too.

693
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:50,665
Let's go.

694
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,533
Beautiful.

695
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:36,189
Don't go posting that
on any flyers.

696
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:38,191
You know I wouldn't
do anything like that.

697
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:41,281
What about this one, though?
Remember this?

698
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,326
My God.

699
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,113
I can't believe
you still have this.

700
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,549
Those hats.

701
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,334
What's this from?

702
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,772
...math club.

703
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:57,123
Yeah. Yeah. We won state
competition that year.

704
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:01,693
Remember this guy?

705
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:04,086
Yeah.

706
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,131
Craig Carter.

707
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,568
He killed himself
senior year.

708
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:08,656
It was really sad.

709
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,267
He was incredible
at math.

710
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,053
He could do
super complicated equations

711
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,141
just in his head.

712
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:16,577
Really?

713
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,013
Yeah.

714
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:20,712
Kids were so mean to him.

715
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:22,975
I remember one time
I was eating lunch,

716
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:25,586
and some kids just came up
and took his food.

717
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,070
Man on P.A.:
All spirit team members,

718
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:33,115
please report to the gymnasium.

719
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,378
Is there anybody
sitting here?

720
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,122
Okay.

721
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:46,041
Is that the pizza
from the cafeteria?

722
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:51,220
I've never had it.
It looks pretty good.

723
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,148
No, no.
Thank you.

724
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:08,281
I still got to finish this.

725
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,375
Um, I'm Laura.

726
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:20,641
You're Craig, right?

727
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:23,339
I'm Craig Carter,
and I'm 18 years old.

728
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,735
Yeah?

729
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,041
Well, I'm 17.

730
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:30,651
I'll be 18 in a few months.

731
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,045
Well, I'm 18 now.

732
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:35,003
Yeah.

733
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:39,399
So, what do you like
to do for fun?

734
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,403
I like to draw.

735
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:45,448
What do you like to draw?

736
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:49,801
I draw comic books,

737
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:51,890
and I draw superheroes.

738
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,109
And I draw cats.

739
00:43:54,153 --> 00:43:55,154
Wow.

740
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,810
And I draw planets.

741
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:01,334
Wow.

742
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,770
That's really --
That --

743
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:04,859
That's a lot of stuff.

744
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,645
Did you draw this?

745
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,780
It's really, really good.

746
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:15,696
That's me,

747
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,829
and that's my cat,
Jake...

748
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:20,396
...who died.

749
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,226
I named him after my dad,
who died, too.

750
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,011
I'm sorry.

751
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:28,883
Why?
Did you fart?

752
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,192
No.

753
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:34,759
No. But I do really like
your drawing.

754
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:35,760
It's really good.

755
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:38,763
You can see that Jake

756
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:41,809
really liked to sit
in the sunlight...

757
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:43,506
Aw.
...'cause he was cold
all the time.

758
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:49,208
I did that a few times...

759
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:51,210
sat with him at lunch
over the course of a few weeks,

760
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:54,474
and then -- I don't know --
things got weird.

761
00:44:57,303 --> 00:44:59,435
Hey.

762
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,748
Craig.

763
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,060
Then that was it.

764
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:18,280
He never talked to me again
after that.

765
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:21,196
That was about a week before
we found out he killed himself.

766
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,868
Come here.

767
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:46,744
Go on.

768
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:11,899
You sure you don't want
to go to dinner with me?

769
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:14,293
I had a really
great time today,

770
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:17,078
but I have to go finish
my paper.

771
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:18,166
Maybe tomorrow.

772
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,125
I'll text you
when I get off work.

773
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:23,171
Okay.
Have a good night.

774
00:46:23,215 --> 00:46:24,216
You too.

775
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,978
Laura, there you are.
I didn't have your cell.

776
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:48,588
Well, I turned
my phone off anyway

777
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,981
because of all the texts
and stuff.

778
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,417
Why?
What's wrong?

779
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,375
When I got home,
the backyard gate was open.

780
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,247
Frisco's gone.

781
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,859
My God.
I thought I closed that.

782
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:01,514
I-I have to go find her.

783
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:02,863
You want me to come with you?

784
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:05,518
-Yeah. Would you?
-Sure.

785
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:07,433
Frisco!

786
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,870
Frisco!

787
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,219
Frisco!

788
00:47:11,263 --> 00:47:13,874
Frisco!

789
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:33,388
Did your dad tell you
why we had to fire Mona?

790
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:35,608
She was robbing us blind.

791
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,259
Elise:
But luckily, a few days later,
I received an advertisement

792
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:20,522
from this maid-referral
service company,

793
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:23,003
and they sent Colleen over.

794
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,353
Nice to meet you, Colleen.
Come on in.

795
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,007
Thank you.

796
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:31,011
Laura: It was him.
Who else would it have been?

797
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:32,578
Jessica:
Maybe he left his phone out

798
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:34,710
or stayed logged in
on his computer or something.

799
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:26,806
Hey, mama.
How's it going?

800
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:29,069
Did he leave her
at the altar?

801
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:33,073
Hey.
My dog ran away today.

802
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:36,468
Wait. Did you just say
that your dog ran away?

803
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:37,469
I'm sorry.
It's really loud in here.

804
00:50:37,512 --> 00:50:39,558
I can't hear.
Yeah.

805
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,821
It's my fault
for leaving the gate open.

806
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:44,171
No.
I'm sorry.

807
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:45,738
Are you alone?

808
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,609
Your dad's on his honeymoon,
right?

809
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,568
Yeah.

810
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,786
Is there anything
I can do?

811
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,834
Nothing. I just wanted
to hear a happy voice.

812
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,314
Okay.

813
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:58,359
Well,
know that I love you,

814
00:50:58,403 --> 00:51:00,840
and I am sending you
good energy

815
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:03,495
that you find her
safe and sound.

816
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:07,803
Thanks, Jess.
Call me tomorrow.

817
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:10,154
Okay, I will.

818
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:14,305
Hi.

819
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:15,654
Good morning.

820
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:18,787
you look exhausted.

821
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:19,962
Emotionally drained.

822
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:21,747
I couldn't sleep last night.

823
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,575
I just kept having nightmares

824
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:25,664
that Frisco got
ran over by a car,

825
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,536
and now I have to write
this stupid paper for school.

826
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,627
One step ahead of you.

827
00:52:32,671 --> 00:52:33,846
There you go.

828
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,674
Thanks.

829
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:37,893
Super awesome of you.

830
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,046
Hello?

831
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:02,396
Kayla,
it's Ben Steers.

832
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,963
Look, I-I --
Is Laura with you?

833
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,356
I've been trying
to call her,

834
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:06,748
and I think
she blocked my number.

835
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:08,228
And I've been trying
to call Jessica, too,

836
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,403
but she hasn't been
picking up.

837
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:11,318
She turned her phone off,
jerk face,

838
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:13,929
'cause a million guys
kept texting her, so...

839
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:16,323
So you know about the flyers
she thinks I made.

840
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,282
Everyone in our house
knows.

841
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:21,241
Well, listen --
I was asking around

842
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,330
and I talked to one
of my fraternity brothers

843
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,941
and he said that he saw
some woman with reddish hair

844
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:27,247
posting those flyers up.

845
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:28,770
What?

846
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:30,990
Look, Laura has been telling
the campus police

847
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:32,818
that I have been hacking
into her computer

848
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:35,821
and sending her weird stuff,
and I have not.

849
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:38,345
Look, I have been put
on disciplinary probation.

850
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,913
Okay, well, what else did
he tell you about this woman?

851
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:42,915
That's it --
some older woman.

852
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:45,265
Will you please
talk to her for me?

853
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,832
That's the woman
she should be looking for

854
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,748
instead of trying to get me
kicked out of school.

855
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,789
Something's not right.

856
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:32,356
You don't look good.

857
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:35,010
Whoa.

858
00:54:37,883 --> 00:54:40,277
I just need...

859
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:01,820
It's Laura.
Leave a message.

860
00:55:01,863 --> 00:55:03,735
Hey, Laura.
It's Kayla.

861
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,476
Listen, I know you turned
your phone off,

862
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:08,000
but I need you to call me
as soon as you get this, okay?

863
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:11,046
Ben just called me and said
one of his friends saw

864
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,006
an older woman with reddish hair
putting up those flyers of you.

865
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,790
And as he was saying it,

866
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:17,836
it seemed like he might actually
have been telling the truth.

867
00:55:17,879 --> 00:55:20,926
So, anyways,
call me when you can, okay?

868
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:23,015
Bye.

869
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,126
Laura: Help!

870
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,911
Help me!

871
00:55:49,955 --> 00:55:52,566
What?

872
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,134
Help, please!
Is there anybody there?!

873
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,407
Help! Please, help!

874
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,930
is there anybody there?!

875
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:10,541
Help?!

876
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:44,183
Please, help me!

877
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,185
Please, help!
Is there anybody here?!

878
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:49,057
I'm being kidnapped!

879
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,842
Please, help!

880
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:53,061
Help me, please!

881
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,939
What the hell is going on?!

882
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,071
What do you think
is going on?

883
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:07,815
Do you recognize
the boy in that photo?

884
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:09,904
Craig Carter.
What is this?

885
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:12,951
You are sitting
in the very room

886
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:15,867
where he did it,
where he shot himself.

887
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,437
This used to be
his bedroom.

888
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,960
Your son,
the one that you said that --

889
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,484
that died
in the car accident?

890
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:27,008
This was when he was 12.

891
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,926
He won third prize
in the science fair.

892
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,972
He was so proud that day.

893
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,496
What am I doing here?

894
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,019
You're here because
you need to understand

895
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,282
how much he suffered
because of you.

896
00:57:40,326 --> 00:57:41,936
I never did anything
to Craig.

897
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,329
I was always nice
to Craig.

898
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:45,505
Other kids were mean,
but I was always nice to him.

899
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:46,898
Start with these.

900
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,644
Please,
somebody help me!

901
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,036
Please, help!

902
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,864
Please, help!
I'm being kidnapped!

903
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:58,562
Please! Please!

904
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:01,216
Help! Please!

905
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,957
Help me, please!

906
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:04,524
Is anyone there?!
Please, help!

907
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,526
Craig Carter's mom!

908
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,007
Craig Carter's mom
kidnapped me!

909
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,618
Please, somebody help me!

910
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:13,185
Please, help!

911
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:16,101
Shut up!
Shut up!

912
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:18,103
No one is coming
to save you.

913
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:21,149
You can't keep me here.
People are gonna look for me.

914
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:23,238
Who? Your father?

915
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:24,849
He's cruising
the Mediterranean

916
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,894
with that little bitch
he just married.

917
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,548
And your friends
in Florida --

918
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,594
they're too drunk right now
to even dial their phone.

919
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,552
And no one can track you
on social media

920
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:35,120
because you deactivated
your accounts.

921
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,907
You think Matthew
is coming for you?

922
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:41,648
Is that who you were
talking about?

923
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:43,650
Well,
I took care of that.

924
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,087
I texted him
before we left the house.

925
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:49,090
You felt so bad
about losing your dog,

926
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:53,094
you decided to drive up
the coast for a few days alone.

927
00:58:53,138 --> 00:58:56,141
What did you do to Frisco?

928
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:58,012
Where is she?
What did you do to her?

929
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:00,058
She's long gone by now.

930
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,581
She's probably wandering

931
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,018
the streets
of Huntington Heights...

932
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:07,195
unless she's been hit by a car
or attacked by other dogs.

933
00:59:13,027 --> 00:59:15,987
Honey, I did all of it.

934
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,293
The flyers

935
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:21,035
that cute little video
on Ben's Facebook page,

936
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:25,083
the letter to your boss,
the coffin -- all of it.

937
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:28,608
Why?

938
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,176
Because you took
the only thing I had --

939
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:33,004
my son!

940
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:35,049
Please.

941
00:59:35,093 --> 00:59:37,051
Please,
you have to believe me.

942
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:39,010
I didn't do anything
to Craig.

943
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:40,577
I ate lunch with him
a few times

944
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,100
so he wouldn't
have to eat alone.

945
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:43,188
That's it.

946
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,147
You did a lot more
than that.

947
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:48,715
I don't know
what you're talking about.

948
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:51,152
It's all right there --
the truth!

949
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:53,285
Please. Please. I don't know
what's in there, but you --

950
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:54,721
I swear,
you have to believe me.

951
00:59:54,765 --> 00:59:55,766
I didn't do anything to him.
-Shut up, Laura!

952
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,071
Shut up!

953
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:58,682
Please! I was never mean!
-Shut up!

954
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:01,423
Shut up, Laura!
Shut up!

955
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:04,992
Why did you even agree
to go out on a date with him?

956
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:08,300
Was it because
you felt pity?

957
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:10,215
Was it to be cruel?!
Why?!

958
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:14,045
I don't know
what you're talking about.

959
01:00:14,088 --> 01:00:16,003
Read it!

960
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:37,851
"Dear journal,
today before calculus class,

961
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:40,680
I finally asked Princess Laura

962
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,335
the question
I've been wanting to ask."

963
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,302
Would you go
on a date with me?

964
01:00:54,346 --> 01:00:56,522
I'd love to.
Friday night?

965
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:58,829
Okay.
Friday night it is.

966
01:00:58,872 --> 01:01:01,179
Okay.

967
01:01:03,224 --> 01:01:04,661
She kissed me.

968
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:13,757
Laura:
"Walked me to class"?

969
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,325
This isn't true.

970
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:20,241
He's made this up.
None of this is true.

971
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:27,771
Lizard, you be good,
Lizard, okay?

972
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:29,773
Because tonight I have a date

973
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:31,426
with the most wonderful girl
in the whole world.

974
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,080
And maybe, if you're lucky,

975
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,821
I can bring her back here
and you can meet her.

976
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:37,215
Are you ready, honey?

977
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:41,915
I have a date.

978
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:44,788
You look great.

979
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,747
Now, remember
what I told you?

980
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,444
No holding hands
on the first date,

981
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,272
no kissing
on the first date,

982
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:52,578
hold the door open
for her,

983
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:54,319
tell her
she looks beautiful,

984
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:55,842
pay for dinner
and the movie,

985
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:58,323
let her pick the movie,
no talking during the movie.

986
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:00,847
Right. And where
are you meeting her?

987
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:03,023
I am meeting Laura
at the mall entrance number 5

988
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:05,199
at 7:00 p.m.
for our date.

989
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:08,507
That is where I am meeting
her -- entrance 5 at 7:00 p.m.

990
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:11,510
Well,
we better get going, then.

991
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:26,133
Why didn't she show up, Mom?

992
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:28,440
Mom,
why didn't she show up?

993
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,235
Why didn't
she show up, Mom?

994
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:44,238
Why didn't she show up?

995
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:46,850
I don't know, sweetie.

996
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:51,419
I don't know.

997
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:00,994
None of this is true.

998
01:03:23,321 --> 01:03:25,540
Craig, you stoner
son of a bitch.

999
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:29,588
Man: Later, Matt.

1000
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,651
It's Laura.
Leave a message.

1001
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:50,870
Hey.

1002
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:52,567
I'm just getting off work,

1003
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:56,006
so I-I just got your text about
driving up the coast alone.

1004
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:58,486
I-I think that's weird
because yesterday we talked

1005
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,403
about getting together
and looking for Frisco again.

1006
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:06,320
Anyway, I left my wallet
in your bathroom, I think,

1007
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,627
so I need to come by and get it.

1008
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:11,630
Hopefully
your housekeeper's there,

1009
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:12,979
so that way, I-I can get in.

1010
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,416
Um...

1011
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:19,899
could you please call me?

1012
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,467
I'd like to talk to you.

1013
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,338
Thanks.

1014
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:47,492
None of this is real...

1015
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:50,016
all this stuff about him
asking me on a date

1016
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,409
and me flaking on him.

1017
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,106
Are you calling my son
a liar?

1018
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,151
No.

1019
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,023
I just think, um,

1020
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:59,025
that some of it
was fantasy,

1021
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:01,941
stuff he wanted to happen,
but it never did.

1022
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:09,949
Did Craig ever tell you
how his father died?

1023
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,908
No.

1024
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:16,956
Jake died
when Craig was 12.

1025
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:21,004
He was so close
to his father.

1026
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:23,441
Craig was such
a smart kid.

1027
01:05:23,484 --> 01:05:26,705
He loved so deeply.

1028
01:05:26,748 --> 01:05:30,361
Do you see that picture there
of that lizard?

1029
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:33,016
Craig found that thing
in the park.

1030
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,974
He nursed him
back to health.

1031
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:40,414
What happened to it?

1032
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,678
The neighbor's cat got it.

1033
01:05:43,722 --> 01:05:46,986
Craig was outside one day
when that cat walked up

1034
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,947
and dropped that dead lizard
right at his feet.

1035
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:56,082
Can you imagine how cruel
the universe has to be

1036
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,779
for something like that
to happen?

1037
01:05:59,781 --> 01:06:01,740
His life was just

1038
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:04,699
one long string
of terrible things.

1039
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:09,139
I did all that I could
to make it good for him.

1040
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:12,011
I -- I tried to shelter him

1041
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,100
from all the meanness
in the world,

1042
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,146
the pain and the loss.

1043
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:19,627
And no matter what I did,

1044
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:23,718
he just kept having
this terrible luck.

1045
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:25,503
I'm sorry.

1046
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,679
I'm sorry about the terrible
things that happened to Craig.

1047
01:06:27,722 --> 01:06:29,463
He was so sweet.

1048
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,030
He certainly
didn't deserve

1049
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,641
the way you and those
other kids treated him.

1050
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:38,037
He didn't deserve that.

1051
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:11,114
Laura?

1052
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:20,688
Laura?

1053
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,302
Laura, are you here?

1054
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:36,530
Laura?

1055
01:07:50,718 --> 01:07:52,111
Mr. Blackwell?

1056
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:53,678
Who is this?

1057
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,854
It's Matthew Hensley.

1058
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,856
I'm worried
'cause I can't find Laura.

1059
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:00,467
What do you mean?
Where are you?

1060
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:02,208
I'm at your house.

1061
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,690
She texted me saying

1062
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,126
that she was gonna drive
up the coast by herself,

1063
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,477
but I left my wallet here,
so I stopped by.

1064
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,739
Both of the cars are here,

1065
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,741
and so is her purse
and her phone.

1066
01:08:13,785 --> 01:08:15,613
Was the door unlocked?

1067
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,745
Yeah.
The -- The back door.

1068
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:20,139
But, I mean,
Frisco got out yesterday,

1069
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,446
so maybe
she went looking for her.

1070
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,752
Is Colleen there?

1071
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:27,581
The housekeeper?
No.

1072
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:30,628
Okay, call Colleen
to find out where she is,

1073
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:32,847
and I'll text you her number
right now.

1074
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:34,240
You call me immediately

1075
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:36,503
as soon as you find
something out, okay?

1076
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:39,202
Okay. I will.

1077
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:06,185
Hi.
You've reached Colleen.

1078
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,187
I can't get to the phone.

1079
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:10,537
Please leave your name and
a number and a brief message,

1080
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,148
and I'll get back to you
when I can.

1081
01:09:12,191 --> 01:09:14,715
Toodles.

1082
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:17,153
Where have I heard
that voice before?

1083
01:09:28,512 --> 01:09:30,296
Hi.

1084
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,645
Hi, Mom.

1085
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:34,257
This is my friend Matthew
from school.

1086
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,649
We're gonna hang out
for a little bit.

1087
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:36,868
Well, that's great.

1088
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,522
I'm just gonna run some errands.

1089
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:39,914
Do you want me to pick you up
something to eat,

1090
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,220
like a pizza or something?

1091
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:42,613
N-No, thanks.
I'm fine.

1092
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:44,223
I can only stay
for a couple of hours.

1093
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:47,226
Okay, well, it was very nice
to meet you, Matthew.

1094
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,359
I hope we see you again soon.

1095
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,752
Thank you.Toodles.

1096
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:54,277
Come on in. I'll show you
my action-figure collection.

1097
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,974
Great.

1098
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:02,198
My God.

1099
01:10:03,373 --> 01:10:05,679
All right.
Let's see.

1100
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:06,854
Um...

1101
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,318
"Maria"?

1102
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,762
C-Come on, John. Pick up.

1103
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,027
John:
What's up, man?

1104
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:51,334
Hey, it's --
it's Matt.

1105
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:52,900
Matt.

1106
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:54,946
Hey, do you -- do you remember
that kid Craig Carter

1107
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,035
who committed suicide
senior year?

1108
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:58,123
Of course.

1109
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:02,475
Do you remember
where he lived?

1110
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:09,439
Why am I here?

1111
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,876
Why do you want me here?
What do you want with me?

1112
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:15,923
I want you to suffer the way
he suffered, the way I have!

1113
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,012
How is it fair that you get
to go on with your life

1114
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:19,057
as if nothing happened?

1115
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,408
College? Dates? Weddings?

1116
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:25,063
My son will never
have a wedding.

1117
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:27,718
He will never get
the chance to live a life!

1118
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,416
It's not my fault.
He took his own life.

1119
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,765
Because of you!

1120
01:11:31,809 --> 01:11:33,027
That's not true.

1121
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:36,901
He wrote stories
in his journal.

1122
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:38,859
These are
his illustrations.

1123
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:41,035
He was so talented.

1124
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:35,568
Laura: Help!

1125
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,136
Kidnapped!

1126
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:40,138
Please, help!

1127
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:42,401
Help, please!
Help me!

1128
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:43,881
Matt: Laura!
Help, please!

1129
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:47,014
Help!
I'm being kidnapped!

1130
01:12:47,058 --> 01:12:48,842
Help!
Is there anybody here?!

1131
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:51,018
Help! Please, help!
Laura!

1132
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:53,586
Help me!
Can anybody help me?!

1133
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:10,995
Dispatcher:
911. What's your emergency?

1134
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:14,477
Yes. Yes.
I need the police.

1135
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,000
I think my girlfriend's
been kidnapped.

1136
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:17,044
She -- She's been taken captive

1137
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:18,132
by a -- a woman named Maria --

1138
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:21,962
Did you come here
to save the princess?

1139
01:13:22,006 --> 01:13:24,008
Well, sorry, but in this story,
the princess dies!

1140
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:31,798
That's right.

1141
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:33,844
She and I are gonna take
a little ride

1142
01:13:33,887 --> 01:13:35,454
to the 49th Street Bridge,

1143
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:37,848
where she'll throw herself off
and end her life,

1144
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:40,198
and you are not invited.

1145
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:41,242
Aah!

1146
01:13:41,286 --> 01:13:43,593
Colleen:

1147
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:02,525
Damn it.

1148
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,978
It's time for us to go.

1149
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:22,501
Where?

1150
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:24,111
That's right.

1151
01:14:24,155 --> 01:14:27,593
You didn't get to see
how the story ends.

1152
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:30,944
I'm gonna give Craig
what he never had...

1153
01:14:30,988 --> 01:14:33,991
the happy ending
that he always wanted.

1154
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:44,654
The beauty of my plan
is that no one will ever think

1155
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:47,874
that your suicide had
anything to do with Craig.

1156
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,181
You had your own reasons
for killing yourself --

1157
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:51,922
the loss of your dog,

1158
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:55,142
the humiliation of those
embarrassing photos online.

1159
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:56,666
I want to be at your house

1160
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:58,972
when your father gets home early
from his honeymoon.

1161
01:14:59,016 --> 01:15:01,192
I want to see someone else
feel the way I felt

1162
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:02,889
when I walked
into this room

1163
01:15:02,933 --> 01:15:04,848
and saw Craig lie in a pool
of his own blood.

1164
01:15:06,676 --> 01:15:08,982
You and I are going
for a little ride.

1165
01:15:09,026 --> 01:15:11,202
Uncuff yourself.

1166
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:12,682
Do it!

1167
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:15,728
Let's go!

1168
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:28,306
Come on.

1169
01:15:28,349 --> 01:15:29,916
Let's go!

1170
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,961
Do it!

1171
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:33,137
Come on.

1172
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,228
I can't do it.

1173
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,579
Aah! Aah!

1174
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:01,600
Aah!

1175
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:13,046
Aah! Aah!

1176
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:24,188
That's Matthew's car.
What did you do with Matthew?

1177
01:16:24,231 --> 01:16:26,364
You little bitch!

1178
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:28,148
Where's Matthew?!

1179
01:16:28,192 --> 01:16:30,281
Matthew!

1180
01:16:33,023 --> 01:16:35,068
Matthew?

1181
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:38,985
Matthew: Laura!Matthew!

1182
01:16:44,425 --> 01:16:45,644
Matthew!

1183
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,646
Laura!

1184
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,169
Matt.

1185
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:54,653
I think my shoulder's
messed up,

1186
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:56,263
and my wrists
probably are, too.

1187
01:16:57,787 --> 01:16:59,745
Stop right there.

1188
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:04,184
Do it. Kill me.

1189
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:06,752
I want to be with my husband
and son.

1190
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:09,755
Don't come any closer.
I mean it.

1191
01:17:15,718 --> 01:17:18,808
Please...

1192
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,157
don't make me kill you.

1193
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:26,685
Do it!

1194
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:39,263
We need to call
an ambulance.

1195
01:17:39,306 --> 01:17:42,832
No. No ambulance.

1196
01:17:44,747 --> 01:17:47,401
No.

1197
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:50,056
No.

1198
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,319
They all left me...

1199
01:17:52,363 --> 01:17:55,366
Jake and then Craig.

1200
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:57,760
My life is already over.

1201
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,762
It would be a mercy killing.

1202
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:02,416
I don't want to kill you.

1203
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,753
Dispatcher: 911.
What's your emergency?

1204
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,408
Yes. I need, the paramedics
and the police, please.

1205
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,758
A man's been hurt badly,
and a woman's been shot.

1206
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:41,151
Is the woman breathing?

1207
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:43,109
Yes.

1208
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:45,372
Okay.
I'm dispatching paramedics now.

1209
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:47,113
Can you tell me
who shot her?

1210
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:48,506
I did.

1211
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,889
Sweetie, hi!

1212
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:25,282
-Hi.
-Did you have a good flight?

1213
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:26,413
Paul, they're here!

1214
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,241
Yes, I did.
Yeah. It was good.

1215
01:19:28,285 --> 01:19:29,416
There she is.

1216
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,505
Hi, Dad!

1217
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:32,811
I'm so glad
you're back.

1218
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:34,378
Yeah.
Me too.

1219
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:36,293
Can we show her
the surprise?

1220
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:37,511
Surprise?

1221
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:39,862
In your bedroom.

1222
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,777
Okay.

1223
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,213
What is the surprise?

1224
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:45,128
It's a surprise.

1225
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:46,477
Okay.

1226
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:49,349
Surprise.
Aah!

1227
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:51,221
My gosh!

1228
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:52,439
I'm so happy to see you.

1229
01:19:52,483 --> 01:19:55,965
This is the best
surprise ever! Hi.

1230
01:19:56,008 --> 01:19:57,967
Your dad called me and told me
that some trucker found her.

1231
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,534
I love you.

1232
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:02,362
You're lucky you got her
micro-chipped.

1233
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:03,581
Did you miss me?

1234
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:41,053
I wish you weren't going
back to Florida.

1235
01:20:41,097 --> 01:20:43,099
Why?

1236
01:20:43,142 --> 01:20:44,361
You know why.

1237
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:45,928
I miss you.

1238
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,409
I miss you, too.

1239
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:51,455
What do you want to do
this weekend?
