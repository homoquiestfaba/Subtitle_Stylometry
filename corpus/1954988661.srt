1
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,867
( Helicopter approaching )

2
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:25,167
( Police siren blaring )

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,867
( Police radio squawking )

4
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,700
( Helicopter humming )

5
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,267
( Ambulance siren howling )

6
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,100
( Sirens blaring )

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
( Tires squealing )

8
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,167
( Gunshots )

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,167
( Shell casings clatter )

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,867
( Heavy breathing )

11
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:46,033
( Radio chatter continues )

12
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,367
( Yelling )

13
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:11,733
Man:
If there's anything else
you can remember,

14
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:14,000
Or anything you want
to talk to us about...

15
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,733
I think
that's about it, sir.

16
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,167
I got statements
from all the other kids.

17
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,100
Sir.

18
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,133
What's the story
with Harper and Wheeler?

19
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,333
They went to talk
to the suspect's parents.
They had a warrant.

20
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,633
I already know that.
Why haven't we heard back?

21
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:42,167
I'm trying to tell you.
They called 15 minutes ago.

22
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,167
- What do the parents say?
- The parents are dead.

23
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,833
Multiple gunshot wounds.

24
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,567
They were still in bed.

25
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,267
Homicide's on the scene.

26
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,567
The final count
at the school

27
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,633
Was six decedents...

28
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,000
Two wounded in the hospital,
one critical.

29
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:00,367
Same weapon used
in both locations.

30
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,833
Shooter's dead.
The parents are dead.

31
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
- We got nothing.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
What about the girl?

33
00:05:10,033 --> 00:05:12,067
That's the other thing
I wanted to talk about.

34
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,033
She still hasn't said
a word.

35
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,567
Her name is
Alicia Browning.

36
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,967
She was standing directly next
to the perpetrator

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,833
When tac officer Parker
took his shot.

38
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,900
It was messy.

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,167
Yeah, I saw.

40
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
We brought her straight here,
but like I said, she's hardly
spoken a word.

41
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,733
I thought you might have
better luck.

42
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,800
When I was in high school
there was this kid,

43
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,367
Paul Ashley was his name.
I hated him.

44
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,133
I really despised the guy.

45
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,367
So one day I decided I was going
to do something about it.

46
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,167
We ended up throwing punches

47
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,367
In back of the field-house
after school.

48
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,367
I gave him a black eye,
he broke my nose.

49
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,367
You can hardly tell.

50
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,867
I remember that when
my parents found out,
they went ballistic.

51
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,567
I was grounded
for a month.

52
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
I ended up losing
a girlfriend over it.

53
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,400
What happened
to Paul Ashley?

54
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
We became best friends.

55
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,567
This boy today was packing
a tech-9 semi-automatic

56
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
With hollow-point rounds
and two clips to spare.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,033
"Perpetrators,"
"decedents."

58
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,033
High school's no place
for kids anymore.

59
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,000
Can I bum a smoke?

60
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,367
Wait a minute...
How old are you?

61
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,833
Gimme a cigarette
and I'll tell you.

62
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,800
Alicia, my name
is Martin van zandt...

63
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm chief detective
for the county,

64
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,567
And I've got an awful mess
on my hands.

65
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,067
I really need you
to help me here.

66
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,967
I want you
to understand that you
are not under arrest,

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,033
And there are
no charges pending.

68
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,167
I looked you up,
and I guess

69
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,567
You probably know
that you've got a file.

70
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,367
There's an outstanding
shoplifting complaint
against you,

71
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,700
But we're going to
overlook that for now.

72
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,800
Having said that,
we've taken a number
of statements today

73
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,367
Which have caused us
to leave you here for
the duration.

74
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,967
Statements that seem
to confirm

75
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,167
That you and the suspect
in question

76
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,767
Were acquainted.
Is that correct?

77
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,033
Look, did he tell you?

78
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,400
Did you know this was gonna
happen today?

79
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,800
Hey, let's slow
it down, okay?

80
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,533
But, I need you
to know that

81
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,533
If you were aware
in advance and didn't
say anything,

82
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,800
You could get in a lot
of trouble.

83
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,067
Not shoplifting trouble.

84
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,400
Real damn trouble.

85
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,100
Look, as much
as anything else,
we want to know why.

86
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,700
You knew this kid.

87
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:38,367
You might be able
to help us make some sense
out of this whole thing.

88
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Point of fact,
this young man's grades
were very good.

89
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,367
That's always the weirdest part
about these things.

90
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,967
Common sense
would have you think
that the troubled kid

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Would pull stuff like this,
the kid with the temper.

92
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,300
But it never happens like that,
does it?

93
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,667
- It's never the bully.
- Alicia: Of course not.

94
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,533
Bullies have to graduate,

95
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,600
So they can become
police officers.

96
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,367
How about it,
detective Martin van zandt...

97
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,167
Did you ever pick a fight
in high school?

98
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:09,367
I would bet almost anything
that you did.

99
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,833
Alicia, did you know
it was going to happen?

100
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,833
No.

101
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,867
If I find out different...

102
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:38,600
If i...

103
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,033
Please don't let me
find out different.

104
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,833
Can I go now?

105
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,200
Sure.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,167
Man:
Why the hell
did you do that?

107
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,967
She's got something to tell us.
She just wants to do it
on her own.

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,833
Bullshit!
What the hell was that?!

109
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,800
I want to know more about her.
Pull her school records.

110
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,000
- You know the drill.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,367
I just don't understand...
The attitude of these kids.

112
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
They think they can
tell us anything,

113
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:15,300
Like we don't get it.
We're not as stupid as
she thinks we are.

114
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,800
Right.

115
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,067
By the way, how much
did that lighter cost you?

116
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,533
Reporter:
Good evening.

117
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,367
Another high school shooting.

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,133
This time in our own backyard.

119
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,967
Police have now confirmed that
there were six fatalities...

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,800
God, I was so scared.
I didn't know for so long.

121
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,167
I must have called
the school a hundred times.

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,067
I'm okay, dad.

123
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,033
That was your classroom,
wasn't it?

124
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Did you know
any of the kids?

125
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,467
I knew all of them.

126
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,533
What can I do?
Do you want to talk?

127
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,367
I didn't know
if you wanted dinner.

128
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,333
I'm going to bed.

129
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,967
Do me a favor,
please...

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
Leave your door open
tonight,

131
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,833
- so if you need
anything I can...
- ( Door slams )

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,567
Martin:
No, I can't tell you
anything else.

133
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,167
You know the news.

134
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,033
Is he asleep?

135
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,567
How much did he see?

136
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,567
Man:
There are lots of questions.

137
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,533
Our people are working hard
to make an arrest,

138
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,267
So that we can get
some answers.

139
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,533
Our hearts go out
to all the families.

140
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,000
Honey, listen,
I'll have to call you back.

141
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,233
I know.

142
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,000
- Captain?
- Where the hell is everybody?

143
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,000
We've got a team over
at the high school,

144
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,567
Another team
at the kid's house.

145
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,567
- I sent everybody else home.
- Sent them home?

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,367
Sir, respectfully,
you shouldn't have gone on TV

147
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,867
And said that
there would be an arrest.

148
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,333
And why would that be?

149
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:51,167
Because this case
is practically closed already.

150
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,000
No, this case is
very much open.

151
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:58,000
Sir, I don't know
what else you want me to do.

152
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you want me to remind you
of your goddamned
job description?!

153
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,833
You will respond.
You will investigate...

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,400
And you will apprehend!

155
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,567
That gun had to come
from somebody!

156
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
The gun was registered
to the father,

157
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,467
And I can't arrest him.

158
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,367
Well...

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,967
Then somebody else knew.

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,233
Somebody who could've
prevented all of this.

161
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,167
Somebody who decided

162
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,567
That the lives of two parents
and five classmates

163
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,467
Weren't worth the time
and effort it took

164
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,067
To pick up the phone
and dial 911.

165
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,000
And you will find
that person, detective,

166
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,600
Because that is your job!

167
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,967
Look, Martin,

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,633
All of those families
depend on us,

169
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,500
On you and on me.

170
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,333
Martin,

171
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,600
How long is it going
to be before your kid
is in that school?

172
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,967
You will find somebody

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,367
To be held accountable
for this atrocity,

174
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,033
And once you have them,
I'll bury them alive
if I have to.

175
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,533
Why don't you just burn them
at the stake?

176
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,767
Are we in agreement here,
detective?

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes, sir.

178
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,933
( Engine starting )

179
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:52,500
Sir, the police want
to take more pictures.

180
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,100
Man: Finally.

181
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,133
Kelly...

182
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,067
Who is that?

183
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,733
Kelly:
That's Alicia Browning.

184
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,367
Alicia,
what are you doing here?

185
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,200
I have tests coming up.
I have to go to the library.

186
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,800
Alicia, dear,
there isn't any school.

187
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,167
Not now.

188
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,133
You must understand.

189
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,533
There won't be any classes
for a while.

190
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,367
Well, can't I just...

191
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,733
Okay, what I mean is,
it's still a school, right?

192
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,133
Of course.
You should have been called.

193
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,833
- We put it on the news.
- I don't watch television.

194
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,833
I'm sorry.
You should have been called.

195
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,167
I have tests coming up.
I'm already a year behind.

196
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,967
I have to get out
of this school.

197
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Of course, but there
aren't any classes right now.

198
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,167
We're coordinating
with Wilson high school.

199
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,000
- We want to try and use...
- what the fuck am I supposed
to do all day?!

200
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Thanks for climbing down,
by the way.

201
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,400
He's got
a really bad back.

202
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,700
( Church bells ringing )

203
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,300
- What the hell is this?
- This is where they told us
to bring you.

204
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,000
Did that detective,
van zandt, tell you to do this?

205
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:22,000
No, ma'am.
This was requested
by your principal.

206
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,933
Doug.

207
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,833
Doug, look who's here.

208
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,000
Alicia,

209
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,567
I'm glad
you could come.

210
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,000
Police car...
Very subtle.

211
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,800
Would you have come
otherwise?

212
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:19,000
Look, I'm really not
into this group therapy,

213
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,800
Touchy-feely bullshit.

214
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,367
And that's fine.

215
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,167
But maybe you
could use the help.

216
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
- There are lots
of people here...
- for God's sakes.

217
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,800
Miss, can we talk
to you, please?

218
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,533
No...
No, no, no.

219
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,800
There are other students...
Go talk to them.

220
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,633
We tried.
None of them want
to talk either.

221
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,333
We just want to know
how our son died.

222
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,067
Why would you want
to know that?

223
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,967
You're lucky you don't know.
You should keep it that way.

224
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
- I know it's hard
to understand.
- You're young.

225
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,167
You don't know
what it's like
to lose a child,

226
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,800
To have him taken away
and there is nothing
you can do.

227
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,400
Thank you.
This has been very helpful.

228
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,200
Please.

229
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Alicia?

230
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,800
What now?!

231
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,333
In other places
where this sort of thing
has happened,

232
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,500
Group meetings seemed
like the right idea.

233
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:06,967
I don't know.

234
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,133
But listen, we still have
a student in the hospital...

235
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,300
Deanna Cartwright,
maybe you know her?

236
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,233
Her parents
are very concerned

237
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:16,567
Because she can't leave
the hospital.

238
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,567
- There's nobody there for her.
- What is wrong with you?!

239
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,333
I'm a leper!
Don't you know that?!

240
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,633
Exactly what is it
when you look at me
that makes you think,

241
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,033
"There's a good-hearted
young lady who wants to help"?

242
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,333
None of the other students
want to go either.

243
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:32,567
In truth,
you're the last person
I would have asked.

244
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,033
Come on.

245
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,867
You said it yourself,
you have nothing else
better to do.

246
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,567
They just spent
the last year renovating
the hospital.

247
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,667
Oh, by the way,
it's got a brand new
library, all its own.

248
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,133
Please, can you go see her?

249
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,000
Just once.

250
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,567
Can your father drive you
in the morning?

251
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,233
No, he can't.

252
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:54,000
Candrive you
in the morning?

253
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,100
( Sighs )

254
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,067
Will you stop sending
police cars to my house?

255
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,033
Yes.

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Don't be late.

257
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
Thank you.

258
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,700
This is her room number.

259
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,833
She has therapy
in the mornings.

260
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:05,700
She should be back
by now.

261
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,700
Will you be needing
a ride?

262
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Woman:
All right,
I'll put you through.

263
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,533
Excuse me,
may I help you?

264
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,167
Yeah...

265
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm here to see
deanna Cartwright.

266
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,067
- She's in...
- I beg your pardon?

267
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,533
She's in room 201.

268
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,800
- Are you a friend,
or are you family?
- I'm neither.

269
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,000
You must be
Alicia Browning.

270
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,867
Come over here
and sign in please.

271
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,200
Hey.

272
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,667
Hi!

273
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,167
No, come in!
This is the right room.

274
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,067
It's Alicia, right?

275
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,400
They said somebody
might come to visit me today,
but they always say that.

276
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:41,800
And usually
if someone does come to visit,
it's not somebody like you,

277
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,367
It's what they call
a specialist,

278
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,500
Which is just another
kind of doctor,

279
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:48,733
Which really isn't
very special to me anymore.

280
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,367
Where did all this shit
come from?

281
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,833
You know,
mom, dad, my friends.

282
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,333
This is the first time you
and I have ever really talked.

283
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,067
You got a haircut.

284
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,700
So did you.

285
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

286
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,967
I guess it was
a ricochet, maybe.

287
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The doctor said it hit me
in the back here,

288
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,533
But it didn't Pierce
the skull.

289
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:33,967
The bullet kept coming
around the side of my head,

290
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,967
Underneath the skin,
but it still gouged out
so much bone that...

291
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I didn't ask.

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
"Those look like
comfortable shoes."

293
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,767
"Would you like
a choc-olate?"

294
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,400
No, wait!
I was just kidding!

295
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,167
I was just kidding!
It was just...

296
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,100
Forrest Gump.

297
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:21,767
Shit.

298
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,867
I figured you'd do this.

299
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,567
But I honestly thought
it would be longer than
four minutes.

300
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Look, I did
what you wanted.
I saw her.

301
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,533
We exchanged
pleasantries.

302
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,967
We talked about
the old times.

303
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,500
- So, can I go now?
- No, you may not go now.

304
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,967
You're going to turn around
and get back up there.

305
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,967
And I'll tell you
something else.

306
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,567
You may consider the rest
of the day mandatory.

307
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,567
No. That's bullshit.

308
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,000
You said nothing
about that yesterday.

309
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:01,633
What I said yesterday doesn't
mean dick today.

310
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,000
See ya.

311
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,167
How bad do you want
to graduate, Alicia?

312
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,833
I said, how bad
do you want to graduate?

313
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,567
I don't have time
for this petty clique
nonsense that kids

314
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,900
Always seem to think
is so goddamn important.

315
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,967
So, you're going to get
your ass back up there

316
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And do as you're told,

317
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:28,533
Because I know you don't want
to be two years behind, do you?

318
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,033
Do you?!

319
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,967
I am not staying
one second past 5:00.

320
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,367
Thank you.

321
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,500
Will you be needing
a ride home?

322
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:55,000
I really didn't mean anything
by that Forrest Gump thing.

323
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:58,367
I was just...
i don't even like
chocolate either.

324
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,733
Shh-hh.

325
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,267
Okay.

326
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,933
You already read
the sports page.

327
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,233
Shh.

328
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay.

329
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,933
What are you smiling at?

330
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,800
Nothing.

331
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:08,200
It's just really nice
to have company.

332
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Really nice.

333
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,133
I'm gonna go ahead
and watch a little TV
while you're reading.

334
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,967
Do you like animal planet?

335
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,167
By the way,
you'll read twice as fast
if you don't move your lips.

336
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
TV announcer:
Animal planet puts
the "wild" back in wildlife

337
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,300
With the "Jeff corwin
experience."

338
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,200
- Corwin: You have
to hold your ground.
- ( Elephant trumpets )

339
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,567
For herpetologists,
I am in seventh heaven.

340
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,633
Oh my God,
what're you doing?!

341
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,833
TV announcer:
Every Sunday night at 9:00,
only on animal plan...

342
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,067
( television shuts off )

343
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,967
I'd like to talk
to you about something...

344
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,967
Look, I'm not here
because I want to be,

345
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,967
I'm in here because
they're making me.

346
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,967
So let's get one thing
straight, okay?

347
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,800
When that clock hits 5:00,
I'm gone... you got it?

348
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,367
This isn't one of your fucking
slumber parties

349
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,567
Where we paint each others
fingernails

350
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,967
And we have
pillow fights.

351
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm not gonna Pierce
your ears,

352
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,833
And I'm sure as shit not gonna
sign your goddamn yearbook.

353
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
Look...

354
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,833
Why don't you just
do both of us a favor

355
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,000
And keep quiet.

356
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,200
Okay?

357
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,600
Okay.

358
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:03,633
Kelly, hold my calls
for the next 30 minutes.

359
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,167
- Sir, the police...
- Especially if it's the police.

360
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,667
John, no...

361
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,200
- Gentlemen.
- The phone's very impersonal.

362
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,867
You know,
I'm just trying
to figure out

363
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,333
What the hell it is
you guys could still
possibly need from us.

364
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,233
You already have
everything we have.

365
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:32,133
And the department thanks you
for your continued support
of this investigation.

366
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,700
There's only so much
you can learn about a person
by reading their file,

367
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,133
I just wanted to ask you
a few questions about

368
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,867
A student named
Alicia Browning.

369
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,167
Little miss sunshine.
Why?

370
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,967
It's just part
of the investigation.

371
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,867
There's almost a year
and a half gap in her
academic record.

372
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,567
- No one seems to know why.
- Have you spoken with
her father?

373
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,133
We will.

374
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:53,167
As for Alicia,
I couldn't tell you
why she was out

375
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,900
Of school for as long
as she was.

376
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,633
You must understand,

377
00:30:57,667 --> 00:31:01,067
We have a student body
of almost 2,000 kids.

378
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,900
It is impossible for me
to know each and every one.

379
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:07,167
Okay, fine...
maybe you can tell me
who some of her friends are.

380
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,700
- Maybe they can help.
- She doesn't have any friends.

381
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:15,133
I'll get Kelly to throw
together a list of the kids
that she had classes with.

382
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,733
But she doesn't have
any friends.

383
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,800
I can also get you a list
of teachers who...

384
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,967
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

385
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,567
Well, it's not that
she's a loner.

386
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,367
The school has plenty
of loners,

387
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,567
But they all hang out
together.

388
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,400
- Alicia is more like a...
- Principal: Goth.

389
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,333
I think that's what
they call it.

390
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:37,367
She not really goth either.

391
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,533
She's more like a goth...

392
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,000
Metal-head, ramp-tramp,
bookworm.

393
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,967
Something for everybody
to hate.

394
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,633
How do you
know about her?

395
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,567
I went to school here.

396
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,000
I've only been out
for a few years,

397
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,033
So sometimes the students
tell me things they won't
tell anybody else.

398
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,533
- Martin, take a look at this.
- Hang on.

399
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,533
The rest is
just common sense.

400
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:02,200
Anyone she
would've hung out with
has already graduated.

401
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
What the hell happened
to this girl?

402
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,167
Alicia:
"Mr. and Mrs. Colby"?

403
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Deanna:
Marcus Colby's parents.

404
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,933
He was in the room
across the hall.

405
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,800
The night he died,
my door was closed,

406
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,200
But I could still hear
his parents.

407
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,400
That was...

408
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,900
That was hard.

409
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,567
Where are your parents?

410
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,567
They used to be here
all the time.

411
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,833
But now that I'm okay,
they can't spend the whole day
with me.

412
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:54,667
They're usually in here
in the mornings or after work.

413
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
Can I talk to you?

414
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,800
- Who sent these?
- Huh?

415
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,200
These flowers...
there's no card.
Who sent them?

416
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,367
Bobby launer.

417
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,367
He's an idiot.

418
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,800
Look at this.
Three gladiolus,
five carnations,

419
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,000
And a bunch
of white roses?

420
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,967
- I think they're pretty.
- It's funeral standard.

421
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,167
Your boy's got
a green thumb up his ass.

422
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,833
Either that, or he's got
a great sense of humor.

423
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,133
Do you know why the carnation
became the funeral flower?

424
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,367
Because they smell
super sweet.

425
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,333
They're overpowering,
right?

426
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:40,967
So back in the old days,
before they'd figured out

427
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,567
How to preserve dead bodies,
they just had to use

428
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,200
Lots of carnations at funerals
to hide the rotting smell.

429
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,967
That...

430
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,567
Really doesn't help me...

431
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,567
At all.

432
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,267
Neither do those.

433
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,800
I didn't get to go
to any of the funerals.

434
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:14,967
They won't let me leave
even though there's nothing
wrong with me anymore.

435
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,967
Actually,
he's very smart.

436
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,200
- Who is?
- Bobby launer.

437
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:21,267
We're in academic decathlon
together.

438
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:26,333
It's like a club,
and we have competitions
with other high schools.

439
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:28,567
I know what ac-dec is.

440
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,000
I think sometimes people hate me
just 'cause I get good grades.

441
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:35,167
Sometimes I have to act dumb
just so people will talk to me.

442
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,333
But all of my real friends
are in the upper first
percentile.

443
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,700
The "upper first percentile"?

444
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,200
Yeah.

445
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,967
- Do you get good grades?
- I'm barely passing.

446
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
So I guess we could
never be friends.

447
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,433
Is Bobby your boyfriend?

448
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:00,800
Well, you better strike now
while the iron's hot.

449
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,900
I mean, you're very,
very pathetic right now.

450
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,567
There isn't a guy in the world
who'd say no to you.

451
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,800
Try to make the most out
of this little near-death
experience,

452
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,500
Which, by the looks of it,
you're handling just
fine anyways.

453
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,533
I guess.

454
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:18,200
You know,
"when life gives you lemons..."

455
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,367
What did you just say?

456
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,367
"When life gives you lemons...

457
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,300
Make lemonade."

458
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:32,467
That is the biggest
load of crap I've ever heard.

459
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,833
What?
"Time heals all wounds."

460
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:41,033
"Everything happens
for a reason."

461
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,900
And "I guess they're all
in a better place now," too?

462
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:52,367
So why do they still
have you here?

463
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,600
Are you cracking up
or something?

464
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,367
That's a very rude way
to put it.

465
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,967
Well, I can't help it.

466
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm fascinated by nuttiness
and its causes.

467
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:09,367
I had a few nightmares,
which really excited them.

468
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,567
They even have
a clinical term for it...

469
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,867
"Repressed memory anxiety,"
which I think sounds a tad bit
overdramatic.

470
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,700
But now they spend
every morning trying to tap
my subconscious fears.

471
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:22,000
Fears so scary
I don't even know
I have them.

472
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,000
It's a complete waste.

473
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:27,000
I usually end up missing
"the crocodile hunter."

474
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,000
Then why the hell
do you go?

475
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,367
Because they make me.

476
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,367
Because they think
they can help.

477
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,733
But they can't,
because they weren't there,

478
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:40,167
So I couldn't talk to them
about it even if I really
wanted to.

479
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,567
You know what else?
The shrink can't keep up
with me.

480
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,000
- I'm way smarter
than she is.
- Are you?

481
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,167
I looked up
her credentials.

482
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,400
They have a great
new library here.

483
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,967
But anyway,
I have a much higher
I.Q. Than she does.

484
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Your I.Q. Doesn't mean
a goddamn thing in the world.

485
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,000
Time served.

486
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:07,367
Okay, well,
it was nice to finally talk
to somebody who...

487
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,133
Save it.
Can I have these?

488
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,867
Yeah, sure.

489
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,967
( Stuttering )

490
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,667
You can finish this.

491
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
- There's a crossword puzzle.
- Thanks.

492
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,867
- Sometimes it's really...
- Late.

493
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,033
But I wanted to tell you...

494
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,500
- You're welcome.
- Alicia!

495
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:24,833
What?!

496
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,033
What?

497
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,033
I'm dying inside.

498
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,500
It's a good library?

499
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,400
See you tomorrow then.

500
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,167
Do you want any dinner?

501
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,367
We had some visitors today.
Two fellas from the local
police department.

502
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,167
Detectives Martin van zandt
and Michael macready.

503
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,367
They said they've spoken
to you before.

504
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,133
What did they want?

505
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,633
I was hoping
it was just another
shoplifting thing

506
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,167
Or a curfew violation.

507
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,733
But they just really wanted
to know more about you.

508
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,200
This boy, the one
who killed all those kids...

509
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,033
- Did you know him?
- I knew everybody.

510
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:07,167
I already told you that.

511
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,000
Of course you did.

512
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,167
They also wanted
to know why you were out
of school for so long.

513
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,033
What did you tell them?

514
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,800
Dad, what did you say
to them?!

515
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:25,000
I told them
that you're almost
20 years old,

516
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:27,000
Legally an adult.

517
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,167
If they want an answer
to that question,

518
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,167
They'll have
to ask you directly.

519
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
What did they say to that?

520
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,167
They said they could
subpoena me,

521
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,300
And that they could arrest me
for obstruction of justice.

522
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,867
- Can they?
- Probably.

523
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,367
But I suggested to them
that arresting me

524
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,333
Probably wasn't
in their best interests

525
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,033
From the standpoint
of public relations anyway.

526
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,600
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

527
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,967
You've gone through more
than anyone your age
ever should.

528
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,200
Please talk to me.

529
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,400
I'm going to bed.

530
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Good night.

531
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,833
- ( Pops )
- ( Screams )

532
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,967
You think
that's funny?!

533
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Shit!

534
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,733
How long
have you been here?

535
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,500
You're drooling.

536
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,567
What time is it?

537
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,567
How can you stay
in the sack this long?

538
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,000
The sun rises, like,
straight into this room
every morning.

539
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:21,833
I'm going to the library.

540
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,033
- Man: Good morning, dear.
- Deanna: Hello.

541
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,600
- Good morning.
- Good morning, deanna.

542
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,033
- Good morning, deanna.
- Hi.

543
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,033
- Hi, deanna.
- Hi, how are you?

544
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,167
Hey, there you are!

545
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,867
What kind of drugs
do they have you on here?

546
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,800
Why?

547
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,833
How can you already be
this peppy?

548
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,167
I love the morning.
It's my favorite part
of the day.

549
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,167
People who think that morning
is the best part of the day,

550
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,967
Are the same kinds
of people that think crust
is the best part of the pizza.

551
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Do you know
everybody here?

552
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:30,167
I'm kind of
a high-profile patient.

553
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,733
Lucky you.
You can get back to school
and you'll be twice as popular.

554
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:37,133
Not for long...
i get to graduate with
your class. I'm a year ahead.

555
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:40,333
- It's not my class.
- It isn't?

556
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,567
They already graduated.

557
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Wow.

558
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,967
I'm a year ahead,
you're a year behind...

559
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,167
We have
so much in common.

560
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,800
No.

561
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,367
Actually,
that means we have

562
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,967
Even less in common
than we normally would.

563
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,800
God, what is wrong
with you?

564
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,367
Nothing.

565
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,667
I like to assume
the best about people.
Is there anything wrong...

566
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,367
- if you keep picking at that,
it's never going to heal.
- I wasn't picking at it.

567
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm rubbing it
to stimulate hair growth.

568
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:14,133
I'm too young
for Rogaine.

569
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,867
Why did you miss a year?

570
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,000
You said this library
was good.

571
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:19,800
All they have
are medical books

572
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:23,367
- and jama magazine.
- "Journal of the American
medical association."

573
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,467
Whatever.
I need English books.

574
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,167
- English?
- If I don't pass,
I don't graduate.

575
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,500
You're failing
your native language?

576
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,167
Fuck you.

577
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,567
You like that word
a lot.

578
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,233
What word?

579
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:43,400
F-f...

580
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,100
F-fuck?

581
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:48,667
You really can't say it,
can you?

582
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,400
Of course
I can say it,

583
00:44:50,433 --> 00:44:52,000
But it's a bad word.

584
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:53,967
It's like taking
the lord's name in vain,

585
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,967
Which you
also did yesterday.

586
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,200
What, you think that makes me
a bad person or something?

587
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,567
I see.

588
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,300
Where are you going?

589
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,033
Deanna?
Where have you been?

590
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:11,167
Your session
with doctor hollander
started 15 minutes ago.

591
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,833
Yeah...

592
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,133
Well, let's go then.

593
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,667
Deanna, let's go.

594
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,700
Maybe she doesn't
want to.

595
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:23,333
Excuse me?

596
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:26,633
Maybe she thinks
the whole thing is crap.

597
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:30,067
Maybe she doesn't like
dumping her guts out
to total strangers.

598
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,567
And while I'll give her
locking herself in a room

599
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,867
And taking drugs with
a couple of older women

600
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,000
Probably has a certain
kinky appeal for her,

601
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:40,067
I'm guessing she just
wants you to piss off.

602
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Miss, that sort of language
is not accept...

603
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:45,200
Shh...
This is a library.

604
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:49,733
We were just going
to smoke.

605
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:52,233
- We were?
- Smoking is not allowed.

606
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:54,000
This is a hospital.

607
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,400
Are you coming?

608
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,967
Alicia:
Let's go, head case.

609
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,400
Tell doctor hollander
I'm sorry.

610
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
Alicia, wait!

611
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:16,133
Martin:
I appreciate you both
taking time

612
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,733
Out of
your busy schedules.

613
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,667
I'm sorry it's taken
this long for me to speak
with you personally.

614
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,800
I'm sure you've been
quite busy.

615
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,733
How long is this
going to take?

616
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:29,533
Basically, I just need
some general information
about yourselves.

617
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:32,000
- About us?
- Your daughter.

618
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,567
Anything you think
could be helpful...

619
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,667
Personal things,
her friends,

620
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,367
Her relationship
to the shooter.

621
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,133
She didn't know him.

622
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:43,033
And I don't think deanna
has a personal life.

623
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,167
- ( Cell phone rings )
- Yeah?

624
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna have to call
you back.

625
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:51,400
All right, bye.

626
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,233
- You're not from here.
- No, we're from back east.

627
00:46:57,267 --> 00:47:01,033
Dan works for hyperion
and I'm with the f.D.I.C.

628
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:03,067
So you both work
in the city.

629
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,800
That's a hell
of a commute.

630
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,900
- ( Cell phone ringing )
- Would you please turn
that thing off?

631
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:11,167
What I mean is,
there are other areas
you could have moved to.

632
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,633
What was it about
our little town that
made you...

633
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,500
We moved here because
of the schools.

634
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,800
It was my decision.

635
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:21,967
Look, are you guys going
to charge anyone?

636
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,233
Because it's been more
than two weeks and we...

637
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:26,800
The other parents,
we haven't heard a thing.

638
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,133
I mean, aren't you
doing anything?

639
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:31,400
The investigation
is ongoing.

640
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,067
Before this attack,
did you notice anything

641
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,000
Out of the ordinary
with deanna?

642
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:41,167
- Erratic behavior?
- No, I told you that before.

643
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,500
What is it
that we're supposed
to have noticed?

644
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,167
Nothing.

645
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,000
You're just her parents.

646
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,400
I'll be in touch.

647
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
- Deanna.
- Hi!

648
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,567
What is the point?

649
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,600
If you want to kill yourself,
there's faster ways to do it.

650
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,800
You know that nurse?
She has it in for me.

651
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,500
She's always
bossing me around,

652
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:21,167
Telling me where to go,
when to go there.

653
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,167
So one day
I say to her,

654
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,367
"Why do you always
treat me like a baby?"

655
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,800
And she says... get this...
"force of habit, honey,

656
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,867
This used to be
the maternity ward."

657
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,967
And I'm like,
"that is weapons-grade b.S.

658
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,900
Give it a rest, sasquatch."

659
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:36,367
No.

660
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
You didn't say that
to her.

661
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:42,000
No, I didn't.

662
00:48:42,033 --> 00:48:44,833
But it would have been
so cool if I had.

663
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:48,567
I like your gloves.

664
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,367
It's like Madonna.

665
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,567
Not, you know,
henna tattoo,

666
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,167
English-accent
Madonna.

667
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,367
More like
material girl,
boy-toy Madonna.

668
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,033
- Can I try one on?
- Go to hell.

669
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,367
Do boys like you
because you smoke?

670
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,967
My mother says
that boys like girls
who smoke because...

671
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,967
Girls who smoke are easy?

672
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,600
Something along
those lines.

673
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,833
Well, boys don't like me
because I smoke.

674
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:21,367
Boys don't like me,
period.

675
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,000
Men are
a different story.

676
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:26,200
What's the oldest guy
you've ever dated?

677
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,133
37.

678
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,067
Deanna: 37?!

679
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,167
I don't know.
I always tried to date
someone twice my age.

680
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,967
Because there's something
to be said for experience.

681
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,967
Of course,
that means every year

682
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,967
The men get creepier
and creepier.

683
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
What is that?
That's an exponential
problem, I guess.

684
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:50,833
I don't know.
I'm failing math, too.

685
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:54,900
- Want a drag?
- No.

686
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:56,567
Yes, you do.

687
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,133
No, it's a filthy habit.
It's disgusting.

688
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:02,000
It makes your clothes stink.
And it's really expensive.

689
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:05,033
Oh, like money
is some big object for you.

690
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:06,567
I've seen you at school.

691
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,167
I've seen your car.

692
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:18,500
Hey, deanna.

693
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:32,800
Don't get me wrong...
I don't resent you.

694
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:35,167
I'm sure you value
all the advantages

695
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,800
Wealth gives people
like you over people
like me.

696
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:40,967
Even though you waste
your time tooling around
with your friends.

697
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,567
Britney Spears pumping,
wind in your hair,

698
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,633
All the neighbors waving.

699
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,667
You really must be the life
of the subdivision.

700
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:52,700
All that money...

701
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:55,000
And Bobby launer
still doesn't have

702
00:50:55,033 --> 00:50:58,467
The slightest
interest in you.

703
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,033
And that...
That is what kills you.

704
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You know
what he told me?

705
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,967
He told me he couldn't
take me to the prom

706
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,133
Because I used to date
his best friend.

707
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:23,567
What was the eloquent way
he put it?

708
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,567
"Bros before hos."

709
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,600
How immature is that?

710
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,967
You believed him?

711
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, why?

712
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:39,167
What I mean is,
I'm sure it had nothing
to do with the fact

713
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,133
That his buddy told him
he never had gotten
anywhere with you.

714
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,167
Nope... never let him
eat you out,

715
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,400
Never polished his knob,
never gave him a rim job,

716
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,233
Never let him grope
your tits,

717
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:52,200
- never let him lick your puss...
- there's nothing wrong
with being a virgin!

718
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,833
Alicia:
Of course not.

719
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,533
It's hip to be
a virgin nowadays.

720
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:01,033
It's never hip
to be a virgin.

721
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,567
- It's really hard.
- I'm sure it is.

722
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,567
Oh, there's a song
about it.

723
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,200
- A song?
- Yeah.

724
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:10,000
I think
it's bananarama?

725
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,000
No, no, no...
It's the go-gos!

726
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,800
"Our lips are sealed."

727
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:17,733
- What?!
- "Our lips are sealed."

728
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,467
It's about
a bunch of chicks trying
to stay virgins.

729
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,333
Okay, first of all,
that's gross.

730
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:25,000
Second of all,
you're wrong.

731
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:27,500
It's about
a bunch of girls trying
to keep a secret.

732
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:29,167
If I wasn't getting any,

733
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,100
I'd want to keep it
a secret too.

734
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,800
Now, if you really want
to get Bobby launer,

735
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:37,833
And he sees you
with one of these...

736
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,367
Like mommy says,

737
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,967
"Boys like girls
who smoke...

738
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,067
Because they think
they're easy."

739
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,000
Here.

740
00:53:13,033 --> 00:53:15,800
( Scoffs )
Now that is just

741
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,167
A terrible waste
of tobacco.

742
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,067
What are trying to do?

743
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,367
Are you trying
to save me or something?

744
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,067
Deanna:
You know something?

745
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,467
I don't think you're easy.

746
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,200
I think you're the most
difficult person I've ever met.

747
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:35,700
( Groans )

748
00:53:35,733 --> 00:53:37,167
Deanna:
No, it's okay.

749
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,000
No, mom,
I understand.

750
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,967
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

751
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,867
Right,
tomorrow night.

752
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,167
I love you too.

753
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,000
Bye.

754
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:52,633
You're checking
those books out?

755
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,100
I'm taking them,
if that's what you mean.

756
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,767
- Can I have
my remote back?
- Why?

757
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,000
No.

758
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,333
Where do you go
at 5:00?

759
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:15,567
I go to
a homeless shelter

760
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,467
Where I serve food
to the needy and less
fortunate.

761
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,700
I don't know.

762
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,367
I don't go anywhere.

763
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,067
Then why do you leave?

764
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,133
Can I ask you
a question?

765
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,667
Does it matter
if I say no?

766
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,000
How do you stay
so detached from all this?

767
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,167
I was unconscious
halfway into it

768
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,967
And I can hardly sleep.

769
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,300
You must have seen
the whole thing happen.

770
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,867
What's your point?

771
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,700
- You seem like
you haven't missed a beat.
- Yeah, well, go figure.

772
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:52,400
( Distorted screaming )

773
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:54,033
Wait.

774
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:56,167
Wait, wait, wait!

775
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:59,833
Wait! It'll pass.
Okay?

776
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:16,567
Actually, today's been
a pretty good day for me.

777
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,367
I should be able
to get some sleep tonight.

778
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,567
Okay, well...

779
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,833
- I'll see you.
- Would you do me a favor?

780
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,800
What?

781
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:30,367
On a good night,
with the right pills,

782
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,133
I can be asleep
before Jay leno's over.

783
00:55:33,167 --> 00:55:37,600
I was wondering,
would you stay till
the end of Jay leno?

784
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,533
- I don't watch television.
- You could read your books.

785
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
They have...
Visiting hours here.

786
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:52,133
You don't care
about hospital rules.

787
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:54,433
Right.

788
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,367
But you could get
in trouble.

789
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,767
If you haven't noticed,
I get special treatment
around here.

790
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,800
I'm not reading you
any fucking bedtime stories.

791
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,167
No, no, no.
That's fine.

792
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,167
Leno?

793
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,000
Not letterman,
not nightline, but leno.

794
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,933
Fuck me.

795
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,200
( "Star-spangled banner"
playing )

796
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,200
( Distorted voices
reciting alphabet )

797
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,000
( Gun cocks )

798
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,733
( Gunshot )

799
00:57:08,533 --> 00:57:11,233
( Anthem continues )

800
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,000
( Whispers )
Alicia, are you awake?

801
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,833
( Low frequency humming )

802
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:57,567
( High frequency humming )

803
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,600
- How did I do?
- A little better.

804
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,567
Doctor hollander
wanted me to remind you

805
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,367
How important your therapy
sessions are with her.

806
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,167
She doesn't mind
you having guests,

807
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,033
So long as
it doesn't interfere
with your recovery.

808
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:26,300
She expects you promptly
tomorrow morning.

809
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,800
And I would really
appreciate it, too.

810
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,800
Okay.

811
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,400
Okay.

812
01:02:32,433 --> 01:02:35,600
- Have a great day.
- Thanks.

813
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:39,833
( Baby crying )

814
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,200
Alicia?

815
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:53,000
What are you doing
in here?

816
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,000
Reading.

817
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,400
Here?

818
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,467
If you spent
a little bit more time
in here,

819
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,200
You'd know this
is the quietest place
in the hospital.

820
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,167
Can we go
someplace else?

821
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,667
Good.

822
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,400
Lets get you out
of here before you burst
into flames or something.

823
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,467
What time did you leave
last night?

824
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,733
- Late.
- Well, thanks.

825
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:25,700
- Hey there.
- Hi.

826
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,833
- I slept really well.
- Good for you.

827
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,800
You know...

828
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,833
There's something about you
that doesn't add up with me.

829
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:42,367
What's that?

830
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,800
What was someone like you
doing in a public school?

831
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:48,967
My parents
wanted me to go
to a private school...

832
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,567
Baldwin prep,
St. benedictine.

833
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,167
But, you know,
I got to thinking.

834
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,000
They didn't go
to a private school,
so why should I?

835
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:59,167
In a public school,
you can really learn more
about real life.

836
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,567
( Scoffs )

837
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,967
So my world
is just some sort

838
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,567
Of social laboratory
for you, huh?

839
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,800
Alicia, you know
that's not what I meant.

840
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:11,367
What are you doing
with that?!

841
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,967
Don't change the subject.

842
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,067
The Ivy league
is an afterthought

843
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,133
For someone like you
I'm guessing.

844
01:04:18,167 --> 01:04:20,367
Where did daddy go
to school?

845
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,967
- Cornell.
- Cornell.

846
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,867
- It's a great school.
- Yeah, you're right, it is.

847
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,567
But if you get in,
you're never really going
to know, are you?

848
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,367
Know what?

849
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,567
Whether you got in
because you deserved it,

850
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,967
Or if they should just put
put a little plaque

851
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,467
Next to your dorm room
that says, "thanks, dad."

852
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,167
I didn't put that
on my license plate,
he did.

853
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,367
He thought
it was cute.

854
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,400
( Telephone ringing )

855
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,167
Van zandt.

856
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,000
No, I'll be home late.

857
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,733
You know why.

858
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,900
I can't.

859
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,200
No, no, I gotta go.

860
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,867
No, I'm sorry.

861
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,000
Mr. Robbins?

862
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:30,800
The department
gave us permission
to begin renovating,

863
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:32,567
So don't give me
any of your shit.

864
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,333
No, it's looking good.
It's good.

865
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,400
I need to search
a locker.

866
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:49,800
Martin:
It's weird being here
without kids.

867
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,400
You probably see it
like this all the time.

868
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,400
I took summer school once.
It was just like this.

869
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,800
I'm becoming
very concerned about

870
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,167
Your interest
in Alicia Browning.

871
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,167
Why would that be?

872
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,967
Is she involved?

873
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,167
You know I can't
comment on that.

874
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,800
I took her to visit
deanna Cartwright

875
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:13,433
At the hospital
a couple days ago.

876
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,867
Really?

877
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,000
As I understand it,

878
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:22,967
At some point here,

879
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,367
You're either going
to have make an arrest,

880
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,000
Or you're going to have
to close your investigation.

881
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:31,033
Either way,
get on with it.

882
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,867
Take as much time
as you need.

883
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:59,233
It's called
a gerund phrase.

884
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:01,800
It's g-e-r-u-n-d.

885
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,167
But you only need
to know that for the test.

886
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,000
You'll never use it
in real life.

887
01:08:06,033 --> 01:08:08,967
Hi. Thank you.

888
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,900
- Do you want anything?
- No.

889
01:08:11,933 --> 01:08:13,167
It's tempting, though...

890
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,167
Dry Turkey breast,
tasteless fruit,

891
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,800
Cholesterol-free eggs...
Mmm, tasty.

892
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:22,167
- How did you know that?
- It's hospital food.

893
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,800
My parents are
coming tonight.

894
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,567
I'll be sure
to leave early then.

895
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,567
- You don't have to.
- No, no, no.

896
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,500
It'll be all huggy-kissy.

897
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:33,900
Probably.

898
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:35,567
Gimme one of those.

899
01:08:42,033 --> 01:08:44,000
You throw worse
than a girl.

900
01:08:44,033 --> 01:08:45,400
Wait.

901
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,600
Close one.

902
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,700
- Do they bring you
good shit?
- My folks?

903
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,867
You wouldn't be
interested. Look.

904
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:59,067
Okay, this pretty much sums up
how mom and dad see me.

905
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,600
A coloring book.

906
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,800
What?

907
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,800
Did they bring you
crayons with that?

908
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,400
Yeah.

909
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,033
Thanks.

910
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,500
There's only
one black one, though.

911
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:19,833
I know it's
your favorite color.

912
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,800
Here's a bop magazine.

913
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,567
Do you like
the backstreet boys?

914
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,967
Yeah, me neither.

915
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,233
You're probably
into that Tori amos,
Fiona apple, whiny rock.

916
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:34,667
But Kevin and Brian
are hot.

917
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,900
Who the hell
are you talking about?

918
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,600
Forget it.

919
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,833
Are those the guys you think
about when you masturbate?

920
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,967
- I don't think we should be...
- Don't say that you don't.

921
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,967
I'm not saying that I don't,
I'm just saying

922
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,500
That I don't think I should
be discussing that with...

923
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:08,967
God, you say stuff like that
just to set me off.

924
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,833
- Why do you do that?
- Because you make it
so easy for me.

925
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,700
It hurts.

926
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,067
What does?

927
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,533
The first time you do it.
It hurts.

928
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:27,067
It's what every virgin wants
to know, right?

929
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,600
It hurts.
It burns sort of.

930
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:33,000
I know.

931
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,167
How...

932
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,133
- How much?
- I don't know.

933
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:42,000
I think it's different
for everyone.

934
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:43,800
It probably doesn't hurt
as bad as,

935
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,167
Oh, I don't know, say,
getting shot in the head.

936
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,033
I mean, come on,
it's not like you see a lot

937
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,367
Of chicks laid up
in hospitals

938
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,133
After getting
their cherries popped.

939
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:54,133
It stings a little.
On the bright side,

940
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,133
If you do it with
a high school boy,

941
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:58,600
Chances are he won't be
in there very long anyway.

942
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,667
Yeah.

943
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,167
You know, I don't know
if I can do it.

944
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,567
- I mean, I want to do it, but...
- Don't worry, it'll happen.

945
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,367
You'll meet
the right guy,

946
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,533
Or you'll meet the wrong guy,
and it'll just happen.

947
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:17,967
Even Forrest Gump got laid
eventually.

948
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,033
I didn't think you saw
"Forrest Gump."

949
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:24,567
Oh, I saw it.
I just thought you were doing
a shitty impression, that's all.

950
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,933
I'm really glad
you're here, Alicia.

951
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,700
Oh God.

952
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:43,233
Here's your damn
God-box back.

953
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:45,567
My God-box!

954
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,367
The Brady bunch... I love
"the Brady bunch." Do you?

955
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,833
I don't know
if I've ever seen it.
It's an old show, right?

956
01:12:00,867 --> 01:12:04,400
The '70s.
It's totally hilarious.

957
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:07,000
- Jesse James.
- Jesse James?

958
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:10,000
Principal:
Jesse James was a cruel
and vicious killer.

959
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:12,333
I'm really surprised
at Bobby.

960
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:14,167
Bobby's teacher
might never have brought

961
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,400
This composition
to my attention if it
hadn't been for this.

962
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,567
He knows better
than to bring a cap gun
to school.

963
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,467
We'll certainly have
a talk with him.

964
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,800
I'm sure he doesn't
intent to make a profession
out of being an outlaw.

965
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,000
( Laughing )
Oh my God!

966
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:36,500
- This show is awesome!
- It isn't funny.

967
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:38,533
Oh, come on!

968
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,067
- It is!
- ( Laughter )

969
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,567
( Siren wailing )

970
01:12:48,733 --> 01:12:51,733
Mike Brady:
He knows better than
to bring gun to school.

971
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,833
( Distorted voices )

972
01:13:10,033 --> 01:13:12,000
( Sobbing )

973
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:59,133
Deanna:
She's very sad...

974
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:00,900
Lonely.

975
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:04,033
I don't know why, but...

976
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:06,900
I know I like it
when she comes to see me.

977
01:14:06,933 --> 01:14:09,967
I shouldn't.
She's mean to me.

978
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,500
But there's
something else,

979
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,867
Something I can't put
my finger on.

980
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,800
To look at her you'd just think
she was a mean-spirited punk,

981
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,967
But I think there's more
to her than that.

982
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,200
Alicia understands me
better than she should.

983
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,700
I don't know why.

984
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:35,000
Deanna, it's very important
for me to know everything
I can about her...

985
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:37,800
Even things you don't think
are important.

986
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:41,000
I know, it's just,
the truth is we don't...

987
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:44,000
We don't really
talk about it.

988
01:14:44,033 --> 01:14:45,567
Deanna,
don't pick at that.

989
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,500
I wasn't picking at it,
mother.

990
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,500
Honey, this girl,
she was the only one

991
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:52,567
That saw everything
that happened in that room
from start to finish.

992
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,567
I know, and I've seen her
with him, but only a few times.

993
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,000
It's not like they hung out
all the time or were dating
or something.

994
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:01,700
That's not true,
'cause the police have
his phone records.

995
01:15:01,733 --> 01:15:04,733
They know he talked to her
for an hour the night
before the shooting.

996
01:15:04,767 --> 01:15:06,667
- Where did you hear that?
- Who cares?!

997
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:10,433
- That could mean anything.
- Why does she keep coming
to see you?

998
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,167
I mean,
what's in it for her?

999
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,567
I guess,
because I'm tutoring her.

1000
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,000
- You're what?
- Tutoring.

1001
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:20,833
She's failing English.

1002
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,967
- What?
- If she wasn't
failing English,

1003
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,567
Can you think
of any other reason?

1004
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,800
No. I...
What are you saying?!

1005
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,967
I'm sorry.

1006
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,167
It's just that...

1007
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,367
It's hard for us, too.

1008
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,800
You've learned something
that as adults

1009
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:46,567
We hope you don't have
to deal with until
you're much older.

1010
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,000
- What's that?
- That there is very real
evil in this world.

1011
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:56,033
And a lot of times,
evil wins.

1012
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:02,833
But there's nothing
you can do.

1013
01:16:05,033 --> 01:16:06,800
You're too late.

1014
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:09,367
If Alicia Browning
had foreknowledge
of this attack,

1015
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,567
And didn't say anything,

1016
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,967
Under the eyes of the law

1017
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,967
She's considered an accessory
before the fact.

1018
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,800
It means
she's responsible.

1019
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:20,667
It means she's the reason
you're in the hospital
right now.

1020
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:27,033
Do you really believe that?

1021
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,367
I need your help.

1022
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,300
You're the only person
she talks to.

1023
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:42,967
I'm not wearing a radio for you
or any of that cop-show stuff.

1024
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Deanna, you are speaking
to a police officer.

1025
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:47,367
It's nothing like that.

1026
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,000
You just talk to her
like you always do.

1027
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:52,000
But the next time,
ask her...

1028
01:16:52,033 --> 01:16:54,733
Ask her if she knew.

1029
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:56,567
That's all I need.

1030
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,467
Can you do that
for me?

1031
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,000
Yes, she can.

1032
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,200
Dr. hollander,
excuse me.

1033
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,100
Deanna.

1034
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,167
Thank you.

1035
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,033
I'm sorry we have to meet
in this room today.

1036
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,067
We certainly have been
missing each other, haven't we?

1037
01:17:40,033 --> 01:17:42,167
- How are you?
- Hanging in there.

1038
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,167
Yeah, I can see that.

1039
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,167
Is the Xanax helping you
get sleep?

1040
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,100
Very much so.

1041
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,067
How are you feeling?

1042
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,967
You already asked me that.

1043
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
You know, in some parts
of the world, violence...

1044
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:02,133
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

1045
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:05,000
Do you ever administer the test
where you look at an ink blot

1046
01:18:05,033 --> 01:18:07,167
And talk about what
the patient sees in them?

1047
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,367
Yes, I have.
Would you like to take one?

1048
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,967
Do you think they actually
give you meaningful insight?

1049
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,800
- Yes, I believe they do, yes.
- Does it work the other way?

1050
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:19,533
Can what somebody else
has drawn tell you things
about them?

1051
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:23,733
Volumes... people look
at a Rembrandt or a Picasso,

1052
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:26,367
And they write 300-page
dissertations on what

1053
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,133
Might have been going
through the artist's mind.

1054
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,167
What does that tell you?

1055
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,033
It might help to know
when you did this.

1056
01:18:37,067 --> 01:18:41,400
Yesterday.
And it wasn't me,
it was... a friend.

1057
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,567
A friend. Okay.

1058
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,000
Well, ah...

1059
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,967
The color is certainly open
for evaluation.

1060
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,900
It's almost random.

1061
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:53,800
Very vivid hues.

1062
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:57,200
The person was pressing
very hard on the crayon.

1063
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:01,100
I'd say whoever colored this
was distraught.

1064
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,867
I'm sorry,
you were being serious.

1065
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:13,367
The coloring stays firmly
within the predetermined lines.

1066
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,500
Almost perfectly.

1067
01:19:15,533 --> 01:19:17,567
Someone is trapped.

1068
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,000
And this page
was probably chosen
for a reason.

1069
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:24,167
Rabbits and bears playing
in a park.

1070
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,467
You don't think these sessions
are worth a damn, do you?

1071
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,067
No, ma'am.

1072
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,967
And you probably think
you that should have been
released days ago.

1073
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Yes, as a matter
of fact. Yes.

1074
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:40,967
I think this whole
"post-concussion syndrome"
is made-up.

1075
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,567
I haven't had
a dizzy spell in days,

1076
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:43,967
My hearing
is getting better,

1077
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,533
The only real issue
is my hair.

1078
01:19:45,567 --> 01:19:47,367
And if I understand
human physiology,

1079
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,000
It tends to grow back.

1080
01:19:49,033 --> 01:19:52,333
These are afflictions
of the body, not the mind.

1081
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,167
There is something
troubling you,

1082
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,200
And this is the place
you can talk about it.

1083
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:05,000
You can't help me.

1084
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,167
No, I can't.

1085
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,167
Not unless you talk
with me.

1086
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,967
You can't help me
because there's nothing
you can tell me

1087
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,400
That I can't read
in the same books you do.

1088
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,000
Have you been
reading books?

1089
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:24,567
What have
you been reading?

1090
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,000
Have you been reading
about post-traumatic
stress disorder?

1091
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:30,000
Have you been reading
the stories

1092
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:33,867
About combat veterans
who have seen and experienced

1093
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,567
The most horrible things
a person can?

1094
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,367
Is it true that there
is no cure?

1095
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,500
It absolutely
can be treated.

1096
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:47,600
With the proper balance
of drugs for the effects,
and therapy.

1097
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,567
But, no,
there is no cure

1098
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,833
In the usual sense
of the word.

1099
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,033
And...

1100
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:04,000
Is it true that
most people who have
post-traumatic stress

1101
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:07,667
Have to live
with it for the rest
of their lives?

1102
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,033
For some people
that is so.

1103
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,067
But not all.

1104
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,100
Okay, that's all
I needed to know.

1105
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,800
The only way you're going
to feel better, deanna,

1106
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:30,067
Is if you can talk
about this.

1107
01:21:32,033 --> 01:21:33,833
I know.

1108
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,000
I know.

1109
01:21:57,267 --> 01:21:59,400
That was a nice
long session.

1110
01:21:59,433 --> 01:22:01,767
How is doctor hair-farmer?

1111
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,467
What the fuck?

1112
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,433
Alicia, did you...

1113
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,967
Ow! Stop!

1114
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,400
What the hell was that?!

1115
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:20,200
- Dive bomber.
- What did I do?!

1116
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:23,200
You should be less
oblivious.

1117
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:26,667
What is it about your cranium
that invites such folly?

1118
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,267
Just lucky, I guess.

1119
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,300
Maybe it's your I.Q.

1120
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,333
"Oblivious."

1121
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:38,033
Sometimes you use
really big words

1122
01:22:38,067 --> 01:22:39,833
For somebody who's
failing English.

1123
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:41,633
Go figure.

1124
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:43,633
You know,
I've been thinking,

1125
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:46,400
I haven't really seen you
around school with boys.

1126
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:50,567
Well, I mean,
I've only seen you
with really one boy.

1127
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,400
Personally,
I was wondering...

1128
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:56,900
About you...
Your relationship.

1129
01:22:56,933 --> 01:23:01,300
- How you... how you feel...
- How I feel about boys?

1130
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:02,900
No.

1131
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,833
How close you were to...

1132
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:13,267
I'm trying to ask you something
that's really hard for me
to ask.

1133
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,133
I'll make it easy, okay?

1134
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:20,533
Huh?

1135
01:23:31,367 --> 01:23:33,033
What are you doing?!

1136
01:23:33,067 --> 01:23:35,467
It sounded like you were
asking me if I was into girls.

1137
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:38,433
- Well, I wasn't!
- Which probably means
you're into girls.

1138
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:41,467
I'm not!
If you wanted to know,
you could've just asked!

1139
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:44,367
You could've just lied...
It was the only way to be sure.

1140
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,300
But you didn't kiss me back,
so you got nothing
to worry about.

1141
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:49,533
I guess.

1142
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:51,900
You are such a weirdo!

1143
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:56,400
The police came
to see me last night...

1144
01:23:56,433 --> 01:23:58,400
About you.

1145
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:00,600
Took them long enough.

1146
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,300
They said...
It doesn't matter...

1147
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,300
But they asked me
a bunch of questions.

1148
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,067
And I think they want
to arrest you.

1149
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,133
- Fuck 'em.
- But they're not
going away.

1150
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:15,200
I don't know what
you're not telling them,

1151
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:17,533
- but they're not going away.
- That's their job.

1152
01:24:17,567 --> 01:24:20,367
- What're you going to do?
- I'll have to check
my schedule.

1153
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,700
- Alicia, they're police.
- Yeah, we go way back.

1154
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:25,467
- No, I mean...
- I got a lot of friends
downtown...

1155
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,433
Stop it,
stop it, stop it!

1156
01:24:27,467 --> 01:24:30,067
I'm so sick of this.

1157
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,433
I'm so tired of listening to you
talking like nothing happened.

1158
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:37,467
That this is all no big deal?!
I'm so exhausted.

1159
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,633
And I still can't sleep.

1160
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:43,300
My head is so messed up
and I just don't care anymore.

1161
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,900
I just can't.

1162
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:46,567
You know those flowers
in my room,

1163
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,900
All those presents?

1164
01:24:48,933 --> 01:24:51,233
They're almost all
from my parents.

1165
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:54,300
Bobby launer didn't
send me flowers...

1166
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:57,267
I just told you that because
I didn't want you to know.

1167
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,333
I read this story
when I was little...

1168
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:09,000
About a princess
who didn't have any friends.

1169
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,467
And her father, the king,

1170
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,300
Couldn't stand to see
his daughter all alone.

1171
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,633
So he used his riches

1172
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:22,000
To buy her some friends.

1173
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,800
When the princess
found out,

1174
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,167
She was so angry
with the king.

1175
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,633
She felt humiliated.

1176
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:38,633
If my father used
his money to buy me

1177
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,500
Some pretend friends...

1178
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,433
I don't think
I would mind at all.

1179
01:25:57,567 --> 01:25:59,433
I want you to leave.

1180
01:26:01,033 --> 01:26:03,633
I don't want you
to come back here anymore.

1181
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,300
You don't have
to ask me twice.

1182
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,333
Then leave. Please.

1183
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:18,000
You know, I got
better things to do
with my days

1184
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:20,233
Than hang around
with a head case
like you.

1185
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:22,567
Then do them.

1186
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,767
Fuck you!

1187
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,200
You little cunt!

1188
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:33,167
Who the fuck
do you think you are?!

1189
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,000
You and your,
"woe is me" bullshit!

1190
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:38,533
You haven't even faced
the half of it yet!

1191
01:26:38,567 --> 01:26:40,600
You think
you're alone now?!

1192
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:42,767
Because you have
no idea

1193
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,600
How bad it's really
going to get!

1194
01:26:44,633 --> 01:26:46,267
Alicia, please don't
do this.

1195
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,700
I know exactly
what you were trying
to ask me,

1196
01:26:48,733 --> 01:26:50,833
And know exactly
what you think of me.

1197
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:52,400
You fucking drama queen!

1198
01:26:52,433 --> 01:26:55,333
Go take your goddamn
guilt trip somewhere else

1199
01:26:55,367 --> 01:26:58,000
Because I don't want
to fucking hear about it!

1200
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,733
Does this look crooked?

1201
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:12,633
- Crooked?
- Yeah.

1202
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:16,367
- It looks crooked to me
if you stand back from it.
- It looks dead-on to me.

1203
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,200
So, I've logged
our first piece of...

1204
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:24,633
I guess,
would you call it evidence?

1205
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,133
Yes, that's what
it's called.

1206
01:28:29,167 --> 01:28:31,200
Good. Well, then,
you must be relieved.

1207
01:28:31,233 --> 01:28:33,500
- It's progress, right?
- I don't look relieved?

1208
01:28:33,533 --> 01:28:36,367
I got a lot of work here...
Is there anything else?

1209
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,467
No.

1210
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,200
Actually, yeah.
I'm gonna have to call
the d.A.'S office...

1211
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,500
They're gonna want
to know what charges
we're thinking about filing.

1212
01:28:45,633 --> 01:28:47,267
What are you doing?

1213
01:28:49,267 --> 01:28:51,200
What are you doing?!

1214
01:28:51,233 --> 01:28:54,100
- I guess I need
a little clarification.
- The hell you do.

1215
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:55,833
Perform your duty,
uphold the law.

1216
01:28:55,867 --> 01:28:58,433
It's very simple... it needs
no further explanation.

1217
01:28:58,467 --> 01:29:01,567
- Yes, sir.
- You know damn well
what charges we'll be filing,

1218
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,900
So put your call into the d.A.
Whenever you feel like it.

1219
01:29:04,933 --> 01:29:07,133
If there is something else
that's bothering you,

1220
01:29:07,167 --> 01:29:09,967
I don't give a shit.
This is our job,

1221
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,667
Like it or not.

1222
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,733
Martin, why did you
let her go?

1223
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:24,200
What are you talking about?

1224
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,267
That first night,
why did you let her go?

1225
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,533
Because I didn't have
enough to hold her on.

1226
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:31,833
Unlike the Mountain
of evidence we have now.

1227
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:35,300
You had just as much cause
to arrest her that night
as you do right now.

1228
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,900
If you really feel so strongly
about what you're doing,

1229
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:40,533
Why the hell did you let her go
in the first place?

1230
01:29:44,267 --> 01:29:46,933
We have to be the voice
for those families.

1231
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,100
Can you understand that?

1232
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,933
If we are going to speak
for them...

1233
01:30:00,267 --> 01:30:03,300
Maybe we should find out
what they really want us to say.

1234
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:14,433
All right!

1235
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,167
What the fuck?!

1236
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:16,833
What the hell
are you doing out here?

1237
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,467
Hey, head case,
I'm talking to you.

1238
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,133
What are you
doing here?

1239
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:27,167
I was in the neighborhood.
What do you think?

1240
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,467
I told you not
to come back.

1241
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,500
Which you had to know was
the surest way to get me
to come back.

1242
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:38,167
Okay, what're you doing
with the needle?

1243
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,633
What the fuck is up
with the syringe?

1244
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:45,467
The doctors
can't make it stop.

1245
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,800
I want to go home,
but they won't listen.

1246
01:32:49,767 --> 01:32:51,600
And I don't care
anymore.

1247
01:32:54,433 --> 01:32:57,900
So, we're into
the real deal here.

1248
01:32:57,933 --> 01:33:00,633
- Okay.
- I can't really
remember it.

1249
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,133
But when I go to sleep,
it always comes back.

1250
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,267
And I don't know
if it's real,

1251
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,400
Or if it's just
what I think happened.

1252
01:33:07,433 --> 01:33:10,267
But I can hear them.

1253
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,567
The other kids...

1254
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,733
Trying to get out.

1255
01:33:14,767 --> 01:33:17,967
And you figure
if you shoot yourself
full of enough poison,

1256
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,667
That'll pretty much
put an end to all that?

1257
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,967
That's bullshit.
That is an insult
to all of those kids.

1258
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,033
- You're trying to take
the easy way out.
- So did you.

1259
01:33:29,833 --> 01:33:33,000
You shouldn't
have said that...

1260
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,167
But, yeah, I did.

1261
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,767
And look at how wonderful
I turned out.

1262
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:41,933
Now...

1263
01:33:41,967 --> 01:33:43,900
Let me tell you
about this, okay?

1264
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:46,333
See, in the movies,
they don't tell you that

1265
01:33:46,367 --> 01:33:49,233
When you slash your wrists,
you also cut through tendons.

1266
01:33:49,267 --> 01:33:51,667
Now I can barely use
this hand at all.

1267
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:55,467
It took me over a year
to learn how to write
with the other one.

1268
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:01,033
Look, I don't know
what it is you want me
to tell you.

1269
01:34:01,067 --> 01:34:04,500
I'm not real good
at this kind of thing.

1270
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,300
Tell me it gets better.

1271
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,900
I can't.

1272
01:34:11,933 --> 01:34:13,933
Because it won't.

1273
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:20,567
I can't make it stop.

1274
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,467
It's killing me.

1275
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,067
Good.

1276
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,167
It hurts because
it's supposed to.

1277
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:34,767
I mean, what would it say
about you if it didn't?

1278
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,433
What would it make you
if it didn't tear you up inside?

1279
01:34:39,467 --> 01:34:42,333
What would it make you if
you didn't feel anything at all?

1280
01:34:42,367 --> 01:34:44,567
You know what that
would make you?!

1281
01:34:52,433 --> 01:34:54,267
Me.

1282
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,067
And I would give anything

1283
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,867
To feel even half
of what you're feeling
right now.

1284
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,233
Okay, listen.

1285
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,500
What kind of music
do you listen to?

1286
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,633
- Pop.
- No.

1287
01:35:19,667 --> 01:35:22,633
What I'm saying is,
whenever I hear a song

1288
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:26,467
That I already know,
I change the channel.

1289
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,300
I look for a songs that
I've never heard before.

1290
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:31,133
Do you listen to songs
you know,

1291
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:34,067
- or songs you don't know?
- Songs I know.

1292
01:35:35,433 --> 01:35:37,167
Okay.

1293
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,500
I going to show you
something.

1294
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,833
Something you don't know.

1295
01:35:46,767 --> 01:35:48,933
But first,
I want you to give me that.

1296
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,233
( Sighs heavily )

1297
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:09,500
So, you're smart.

1298
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,067
What's in this?

1299
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:16,600
Potassium chloride.

1300
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:20,433
You'd kill yourself
before you hit the ground.

1301
01:36:20,467 --> 01:36:22,933
Just faster than smoking.

1302
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,967
You made a joke.

1303
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,167
Yeah, and it took
a lot outta me, so...

1304
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,700
Don't expect another one.

1305
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,300
Alicia: Come on.

1306
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:42,800
Deanna:
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

1307
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:46,267
- it wasn't
a very good joke.
- I know.

1308
01:37:05,067 --> 01:37:08,033
( Walkie-talkie chatter )

1309
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,667
- What room is this?
- Shh.

1310
01:37:26,333 --> 01:37:28,633
Alicia:
Wait right here.

1311
01:37:28,667 --> 01:37:30,733
Deanna:
Alicia, it's cold in here.

1312
01:37:32,667 --> 01:37:34,733
- Oh Jesus!
- What?! What's wrong?!

1313
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:36,367
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

1314
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,533
No, why won't you look?

1315
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,333
( Screaming )

1316
01:37:41,367 --> 01:37:43,600
What, are you scared?!

1317
01:37:43,633 --> 01:37:46,333
- What is there
to be scared of?!
- God damn it!

1318
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,833
Alicia: Look.

1319
01:37:56,433 --> 01:37:58,433
Turn around and look!

1320
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,500
You've got it all wrong.

1321
01:38:03,533 --> 01:38:05,167
There's nothing here.

1322
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,767
Nothing.

1323
01:38:09,267 --> 01:38:11,800
You wouldn't have been afraid
of him when he was alive,

1324
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,500
Why should you be afraid
of him now?

1325
01:38:13,533 --> 01:38:17,733
There is no hatred
in this room.

1326
01:38:19,167 --> 01:38:21,000
No anger.

1327
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:29,833
There's no violence.

1328
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:35,133
There's less
to be afraid of in here

1329
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:38,500
Than anywhere else
in the whole world.

1330
01:39:52,033 --> 01:39:55,100
Alicia:
So, what do you think?

1331
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:08,933
You look just like him.

1332
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,033
Hey, get out of here.

1333
01:40:43,067 --> 01:40:46,000
Do whatever it takes,

1334
01:40:46,033 --> 01:40:49,233
But get your parents
to get you out of here.

1335
01:40:49,267 --> 01:40:51,200
It'll kill you
if you don't.

1336
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:57,033
You're not coming back,
are you?

1337
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:01,933
I'm not going
to see you again, am I?

1338
01:41:01,967 --> 01:41:03,967
I'll be around.

1339
01:41:06,933 --> 01:41:08,567
Alicia.

1340
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,767
Are you real?

1341
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:18,433
I mean, this whole thing,
it really happened.

1342
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:23,267
Good night, deanna.

1343
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,267
Bye.

1344
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,467
- Bye.
- Take care.

1345
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,167
Thanks.

1346
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,667
( Rock music playing )

1347
01:42:14,633 --> 01:42:16,633
* that's when
they'll disappear *

1348
01:42:16,667 --> 01:42:18,633
* that's when we'll
be feared. *

1349
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:20,667
Wait! Wait, dad,
go back one!

1350
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,000
* in the jealous games
people play *

1351
01:42:28,167 --> 01:42:30,133
* our lips are sealed

1352
01:42:30,167 --> 01:42:33,300
- ( screams, applauds )
- What? Are you okay?!

1353
01:42:35,833 --> 01:42:38,700
Yeah. I'm fine.

1354
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,733
* our lips are sealed.

1355
01:43:53,433 --> 01:43:55,600
If you need them,
they'll be ready.

1356
01:44:04,567 --> 01:44:07,167
- Captain.
- Detective.

1357
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,200
- What do you need?
- Do you remember 1988?

1358
01:44:10,233 --> 01:44:12,967
We killed one of our own
undercovers.

1359
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,400
I was in charge
of the bust.

1360
01:44:15,433 --> 01:44:17,567
- Remember that?
- Of course I do.

1361
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,800
The review board asked me
to resign.

1362
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:21,300
And when I didn't,

1363
01:44:21,333 --> 01:44:23,300
They were gonna pin
the whole thing on me.

1364
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:25,833
You went in front of them
and got me off the hook.

1365
01:44:25,867 --> 01:44:27,500
Remember what you said
to them?

1366
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,967
I've just spent
the better part of the last

1367
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,100
Two months looking at this thing
from every angle possible.

1368
01:44:34,133 --> 01:44:37,167
And I've spoken
with the families.
All of them.

1369
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:40,667
And now I think that only one
of two things can happen.

1370
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:43,500
Sir, I have macready
and Harper and Wheeler

1371
01:44:43,533 --> 01:44:46,733
And half a dozen uniforms ready
to leave here right now.

1372
01:44:46,767 --> 01:44:50,300
And I got the order here
from the judge to make it
all nice and neat.

1373
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,800
But before I go,
I gotta hear it from you.

1374
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:56,567
One more time...
I want to hear you say

1375
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,233
That we're going to lay
nine murders

1376
01:44:59,267 --> 01:45:01,967
At the feet
of a teenage girl,

1377
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,833
Because of
a telephone bill.

1378
01:45:04,867 --> 01:45:06,833
You know,
I don't care too much

1379
01:45:06,867 --> 01:45:10,300
About what people say
out there in the world...
we're police officers,

1380
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:12,133
And that means
that at some point,

1381
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:15,967
Right and wrong has
to factor into this.

1382
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,633
Doesn't it?

1383
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:20,600
So if you tell me that
this is the right thing to do,

1384
01:45:20,633 --> 01:45:23,100
I'll be at her front door
in 10 minutes.

1385
01:45:24,333 --> 01:45:27,000
All you have to do
is sign it, sir.

1386
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,667
What a mess.

1387
01:45:53,967 --> 01:45:57,433
Sir,
with your permission,

1388
01:45:57,467 --> 01:46:00,300
This is what
I'd like to do.

1389
01:46:17,333 --> 01:46:19,833
Do you know if any
of the others are coming?

1390
01:46:21,233 --> 01:46:23,333
I was hoping for
a little better turnout.

1391
01:46:23,367 --> 01:46:25,400
My parents don't even
know I'm here.

1392
01:46:44,267 --> 01:46:46,233
Deanna:
Is this everyone?

1393
01:46:46,267 --> 01:46:47,933
Looks that way.

1394
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:52,900
Listen,
what we're doing here,

1395
01:46:52,933 --> 01:46:55,100
A lot of people will say
is a mistake.

1396
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:00,133
That going back in here so soon
is the wrong thing to do.

1397
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:02,967
That it's insensitive.

1398
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,933
I think it's very important.

1399
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,633
This is the kind
of thing that people want
to put behind them,

1400
01:47:09,667 --> 01:47:11,467
They want
to stop talking about it.

1401
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,133
And the second you do that

1402
01:47:13,167 --> 01:47:15,800
Is the second it happens
all over again.

1403
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:18,067
This is not a requirement.

1404
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:21,067
None of you have to do this
if you don't want to.

1405
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,200
Okay then.

1406
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,233
It smells kind
of funny.

1407
01:47:52,267 --> 01:47:54,267
They painted it.

1408
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:56,600
- It smells like paint.
- Is it the right color?

1409
01:47:56,633 --> 01:47:59,067
Together: No.

1410
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:01,300
It's really close,
though.

1411
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,467
There were 16 shots fired
in this classroom.

1412
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,600
Most of them came
from the back there.

1413
01:48:07,633 --> 01:48:10,800
He ran out as he moved forward
along the side wall.

1414
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:12,633
Boy:
Okay, does that mean
anything?

1415
01:48:12,667 --> 01:48:15,067
It means it wasn't a spur
of the moment decision.

1416
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,633
He came in
through the back,

1417
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:19,800
Knowing everybody would panic
trying to get out this door.

1418
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:21,967
Boy #2:
Is there a point
you're making?

1419
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,500
It's very odd
from the detached viewpoint
of law enforcement.

1420
01:48:27,233 --> 01:48:30,467
In a mass shooting,
you usually see twice
as many wounded as killed.

1421
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:33,800
But in this case,
everyone who was shot died.

1422
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:38,167
- Girl: Except for deanna.
- Martin: Except for deanna.

1423
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:42,167
Of course, why he did it
is still unanswered.

1424
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:45,900
- If you wanted to know that,
you shouldn't have killed him.
- That's brilliant.

1425
01:48:45,933 --> 01:48:48,567
What were they supposed to do,
ask him to politely stop?

1426
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,767
Deanna:
No, I think he's right.
They didn't have to kill him.

1427
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,167
- What, are you both fucked?
- Okay, okay! Hey.

1428
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,733
Everyone can talk here,
all right?

1429
01:48:56,767 --> 01:48:58,567
And just
so you understand,

1430
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,433
The tactical officer performed
his job to the letter.

1431
01:49:01,467 --> 01:49:04,233
And I bet you gave him
a big fat medal for it.

1432
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:06,133
As a matter of fact,
he resigned.

1433
01:49:06,167 --> 01:49:08,133
He doesn't even
live here anymore.

1434
01:49:10,533 --> 01:49:13,767
- Deanna, how do you feel
about being in here?
- I don't like it.

1435
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,467
I don't know if they should
ever use this room again.

1436
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,100
Boy #3:
But you know they will.

1437
01:49:18,133 --> 01:49:21,800
After everybody graduates,
they'll act like it
never happened.

1438
01:49:21,833 --> 01:49:24,300
What are your plans
after graduation, James?

1439
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:26,933
- You're the class president?
- Yes, sir.

1440
01:49:26,967 --> 01:49:30,333
I was planning
on going straight
to college, but...

1441
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:36,300
I might just take
some time off.

1442
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:38,300
Deanna?

1443
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:40,133
I just got a scholarship
to Cornell.

1444
01:49:40,167 --> 01:49:43,167
That's excellent.
Congratulations.

1445
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:45,233
I don't know
if I'm going or not.

1446
01:49:45,267 --> 01:49:48,967
Shit, if I was you,
I'd be like, "see ya."

1447
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,567
I'd get as far away
from here as I could.

1448
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:54,067
I'll be stuck
in community college forever.

1449
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,833
Girl:
I haven't really thought
about it too much.

1450
01:49:56,867 --> 01:49:59,133
I guess I should,
though.

1451
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:03,067
I'd really rather not
even graduate,

1452
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,033
If you want to know
the truth.

1453
01:50:05,067 --> 01:50:06,933
Doug?

1454
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:11,500
Whatever you cops
will let me do, I'll do.

1455
01:50:11,533 --> 01:50:13,267
I don't like to look
too far ahead.

1456
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,000
I don't even want to deal
with right now, you know?

1457
01:50:16,033 --> 01:50:18,733
- This whole thing?
- Deanna: You have to.

1458
01:50:18,767 --> 01:50:21,600
I mean, it's there,
whether you like it or not.

1459
01:50:22,767 --> 01:50:24,567
We graduate
in three days,

1460
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:27,100
So you better be ready
for that black armband.

1461
01:50:28,267 --> 01:50:30,900
You know
it won't stop there.

1462
01:50:30,933 --> 01:50:33,067
At the five-year reunion,

1463
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,267
Be ready for that
moment of silence.

1464
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,333
It'll be with us forever.

1465
01:50:39,367 --> 01:50:42,900
The sooner you accept that,
the easier it'll be.

1466
01:50:42,933 --> 01:50:45,500
I don't know why it had
to happen here.

1467
01:50:45,533 --> 01:50:49,333
I mean, it's home room.

1468
01:50:49,367 --> 01:50:52,000
We're only in here
for 15 minutes everyday.

1469
01:50:52,033 --> 01:50:54,600
Let's talk about that then.

1470
01:50:54,633 --> 01:50:56,800
- ( Sobbing )
- Cathy?

1471
01:50:56,833 --> 01:50:59,033
You don't have to stay
if this is too hard.

1472
01:51:01,767 --> 01:51:03,600
James is right.

1473
01:51:06,433 --> 01:51:08,567
It was just such
a normal day.

1474
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,567
You know how
some people said that

1475
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,867
When they heard
the gunshot that...

1476
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,100
It sounded like
firecrackers?

1477
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,133
I didn't.

1478
01:51:19,167 --> 01:51:21,067
Somehow I knew.

1479
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:24,767
He aimed over here
and I closed my eyes...

1480
01:51:26,767 --> 01:51:28,733
And he fired.

1481
01:51:28,767 --> 01:51:30,767
And when I opened them,

1482
01:51:33,267 --> 01:51:36,100
It was Marcus
that was shot instead.

1483
01:51:38,433 --> 01:51:41,733
And I was just so...

1484
01:51:41,767 --> 01:51:43,600
Jesus, I was...

1485
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,633
What?

1486
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:50,500
Were you glad?

1487
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,433
Yes.

1488
01:51:58,767 --> 01:52:01,633
You were glad that
he shot Marcus Colby
and not you.

1489
01:52:01,667 --> 01:52:05,633
I never got to tell him
I was sorry for thinking that.

1490
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:07,633
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

1491
01:52:07,667 --> 01:52:12,733
Self-preservation
is the most powerful
instinct you have, okay?

1492
01:52:12,767 --> 01:52:14,567
It gave you the time
you needed

1493
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,633
To get out
of the room alive.

1494
01:52:16,667 --> 01:52:18,633
I know it's not easy,

1495
01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:20,800
But it's nothing to be
ashamed of either.

1496
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:23,133
Now see,
why are we doing this?

1497
01:52:23,167 --> 01:52:24,967
This is why
nobody else came.

1498
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,567
Once was enough.

1499
01:52:26,600 --> 01:52:28,567
What happened
in here was the most...

1500
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,933
Alicia:
How would you know?

1501
01:52:30,967 --> 01:52:33,133
You were the first person
out the door.

1502
01:52:33,167 --> 01:52:36,133
You don't have a clue
what happened in here.

1503
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:39,800
- What are you doing here?
- I do believe everyone
was invited.

1504
01:52:39,833 --> 01:52:42,667
Am I right,
detective Martin van zandt?

1505
01:52:43,667 --> 01:52:46,233
- Hey, head case.
- Hi.

1506
01:52:46,267 --> 01:52:49,267
She shouldn't be here.
She's not even one of us.

1507
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,900
Martin:
What does that mean?

1508
01:52:50,933 --> 01:52:53,300
It means nobody likes her
because she's a damn freak.

1509
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:55,567
If you're what's passing
for normal,

1510
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,100
I'll keep the fucking
straitjacket. Thanks.

1511
01:52:58,133 --> 01:53:02,500
- She looks like the crow.
- What is it that makes her
a freak?

1512
01:53:06,933 --> 01:53:09,867
- That!
- That is so warped.

1513
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:12,800
- What the fuck? It's my gum.
- From about three months ago.

1514
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,633
You know,
I think Alicia's okay.

1515
01:53:15,667 --> 01:53:18,967
Thank you, Douglas.
That means so much coming
from a skate-rat

1516
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,733
Who hangs in the Wal-Mart
parking lot until 3:00 A.M.

1517
01:53:23,267 --> 01:53:25,300
It smells funny in here.

1518
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:27,133
Maybe we should get
some carnations.

1519
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:29,800
James:
She's not one of us
because she was supposed

1520
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,267
To graduate like,
10 years ago.

1521
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,767
Martin: So be it.

1522
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,433
But she still has a perspective
on this that might be helpful.

1523
01:53:36,467 --> 01:53:38,067
Yeah, she knew
the motherfucker.

1524
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,800
So what?
So what if she did?

1525
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:43,300
So I bet he didn't even think
about killing her.

1526
01:53:43,333 --> 01:53:45,567
Great! So she wasn't
a marked target.

1527
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:47,567
Maybe if we were all
nicer to each other,

1528
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,567
Nobody would ever be
a marked target.

1529
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:52,400
Yeah, "why can't
we all just get along?"

1530
01:53:52,433 --> 01:53:55,467
Jesus... happy endings
everywhere.

1531
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:59,433
With you,
even mushroom clouds
have silver linings.

1532
01:54:00,933 --> 01:54:03,300
Why do you let her talk
to you like that?

1533
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,567
Because she's right.

1534
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,200
I am that way.

1535
01:54:18,333 --> 01:54:19,867
You stopped smoking.

1536
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,633
Yeah, well...

1537
01:54:21,667 --> 01:54:24,067
Maybe I started
something worse.

1538
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,300
Listen, I don't have
all day,

1539
01:54:26,333 --> 01:54:28,067
So let's get to it.

1540
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:31,467
Did it ever dawn on you

1541
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,633
That maybe there are
no answers here?

1542
01:54:33,667 --> 01:54:35,500
That maybe he came
in here shooting

1543
01:54:35,533 --> 01:54:38,967
- without a single thought
in his fucked-up head?
- It crossed my mind.

1544
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,933
I don't think it
lasted longer than
30 seconds.

1545
01:54:41,967 --> 01:54:44,233
He shot at whatever
wasn't moving.

1546
01:54:44,267 --> 01:54:47,267
People got bunched up
at the door, so...

1547
01:54:48,933 --> 01:54:51,100
It made it real easy.

1548
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,167
And just so you know,

1549
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:01,300
You didn't get hit
by any ricochet.

1550
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:04,800
He aimed for the back
of your head, point blank.

1551
01:55:04,833 --> 01:55:07,467
I thought you were dead
for sure.

1552
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,467
The fact that you're
alive right now

1553
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,933
Is the weirdest part
of this whole thing.

1554
01:55:15,167 --> 01:55:18,700
So if it only took
30 seconds,

1555
01:55:18,733 --> 01:55:22,333
And it took us six minutes
to get on scene...

1556
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,167
What happened the rest
of the time?

1557
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,933
What did happen?

1558
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,667
She kept him in here.

1559
01:56:06,867 --> 01:56:09,400
You kept him from going
anywhere else in the school.

1560
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:14,167
Because you were the only one
he would listen to.

1561
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:20,033
You stopped him from hurting
anyone else.

1562
01:56:30,833 --> 01:56:33,300
Thank you, Alicia.

1563
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,333
Yeah.

1564
01:56:38,767 --> 01:56:40,767
No, thank you.

1565
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:44,033
I'm a true fucking hero,
is that it?

1566
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,233
Yeah, well...

1567
01:56:47,267 --> 01:56:49,833
Sometimes I really don't
understand you.

1568
01:56:49,867 --> 01:56:53,000
- Perfect.
- Why do you want everyone
to hate you so much?

1569
01:56:53,033 --> 01:56:56,233
You dress so that no one
will come near you,

1570
01:56:56,267 --> 01:56:58,233
We have
nothing in common,

1571
01:56:58,267 --> 01:57:01,133
We'd never even talked
to each other until you came...

1572
01:57:01,167 --> 01:57:03,100
To the hospital.

1573
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:08,133
Wait.

1574
01:57:08,167 --> 01:57:10,167
Alicia's voice:
It's tempting, though.

1575
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,800
Dry Turkey breast,
tasteless fruit,

1576
01:57:12,833 --> 01:57:15,700
Cholesterol-free eggs.
Mmm, tasty.

1577
01:57:15,733 --> 01:57:16,933
How did you know that?

1578
01:57:16,967 --> 01:57:19,967
If you spent a little bit
more time in here,

1579
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,500
You'd know this
is the quietest place
in the hospital.

1580
01:57:23,667 --> 01:57:25,867
How can you stay
in the sack this long?

1581
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:29,233
The sun also rises straight
into this room every morning.

1582
01:57:31,733 --> 01:57:33,500
Don't.

1583
01:57:33,533 --> 01:57:35,967
We had the same
hospital room.

1584
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,900
201.

1585
01:57:39,167 --> 01:57:40,667
So...?

1586
01:57:43,933 --> 01:57:46,733
But you've been back
in school for a while now.

1587
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:49,767
So it must have been
over a year ago.

1588
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,667
Before the library,

1589
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,167
Before the renovation...

1590
01:57:56,433 --> 01:57:59,733
When the recovery ward
used to be the maternity ward.

1591
01:57:59,767 --> 01:58:02,133
- Shut up.
- She told me that.

1592
01:58:02,167 --> 01:58:05,800
The nurse made a joke about
how the recovery ward used
to be the maternity ward.

1593
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:08,000
Shut up.

1594
01:58:08,033 --> 01:58:09,500
It's okay.

1595
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,967
You have a baby,
don't you?

1596
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,167
No, you really need
to stop now!

1597
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:22,767
It's all right.

1598
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,333
Hollander:
This page was probably
chosen for a reason.

1599
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:27,633
Rabbits and bears playing
in a park.

1600
01:58:27,667 --> 01:58:29,300
That's why you missed a year.

1601
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,300
Fuck you,
you cocksucker!

1602
01:58:32,333 --> 01:58:33,967
You don't know shit
about me!

1603
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,367
Who the fuck do you
think you are?!

1604
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,100
You think you can come in here
and spend 10 minutes

1605
01:58:39,133 --> 01:58:41,267
And come out with
all the fucking answers?!

1606
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:43,400
Hey, I've got one...
Kids pick up guns

1607
01:58:43,433 --> 01:58:46,300
And kill other kids!
That's it!

1608
01:58:46,333 --> 01:58:48,367
And if that answer
isn't good enough,

1609
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,933
Then maybe you should go see
a doctor or a priest,

1610
01:58:50,967 --> 01:58:52,367
And you can ask them why.

1611
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,800
They'll feed you
all the psychobabble
you can stand.

1612
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:58,433
Or they'll tell you
that God has some greater
plan for everyone.

1613
01:58:58,467 --> 01:59:01,733
And when you keep pressing
and those answers aren't
good enough,

1614
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:04,733
All they have left to tell you
is the unholy truth,

1615
01:59:04,767 --> 01:59:07,000
That kids just die!

1616
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,167
And babies die, too.

1617
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:27,833
It just happens...

1618
01:59:31,333 --> 01:59:33,167
So you live with it.

1619
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:40,267
Deanna:
Oh no, Alicia,
I'm sorry.

1620
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:42,333
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

1621
01:59:43,833 --> 01:59:45,600
I shouldn't have...

1622
01:59:46,933 --> 01:59:48,767
Oh my God.

1623
01:59:49,933 --> 01:59:51,333
Alicia:
You know...

1624
01:59:51,367 --> 01:59:53,267
When you don't have...

1625
01:59:55,267 --> 01:59:56,933
Any money...

1626
01:59:58,933 --> 02:00:00,933
And your baby dies...

1627
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:08,267
The funeral home gives you
this casket...

1628
02:00:09,933 --> 02:00:11,767
For free.

1629
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:19,267
I guess, it's about...

1630
02:00:24,433 --> 02:00:26,267
This big...

1631
02:00:27,933 --> 02:00:30,767
And it's made...

1632
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:34,700
Out of styrofoam.

1633
02:00:36,267 --> 02:00:39,767
It's like one of those things
you would take on a picnic.

1634
02:00:41,467 --> 02:00:43,567
Did you even know
there was such a thing

1635
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:45,900
As a styrofoam coffin?

1636
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:51,867
How fucked up is that?

1637
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:02,667
When?

1638
02:01:04,267 --> 02:01:06,400
Two winters ago.

1639
02:01:06,433 --> 02:01:08,267
We had that...

1640
02:01:09,933 --> 02:01:12,800
Colossal ice storm.
Do you remember that?

1641
02:01:12,833 --> 02:01:15,400
No school for two weeks.

1642
02:01:15,433 --> 02:01:17,233
Alicia: Yeah.

1643
02:01:18,267 --> 02:01:22,533
She was born...

1644
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:29,033
And she died
on December 21st.

1645
02:01:34,033 --> 02:01:36,133
The thing...

1646
02:01:36,167 --> 02:01:38,967
The machine at the cemetery
couldn't dig,

1647
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,200
'Cause the ground
was too hard.

1648
02:01:43,767 --> 02:01:45,600
It was frozen.

1649
02:01:49,267 --> 02:01:52,600
We had to wait until
after Christmas to bury her.

1650
02:01:57,433 --> 02:02:00,267
Why would you ever go back
to that hospital?

1651
02:02:04,833 --> 02:02:06,833
Why did you come back here?

1652
02:02:16,667 --> 02:02:18,667
What did you call her?

1653
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,767
Your daughter...

1654
02:02:26,333 --> 02:02:28,333
What was
your daughter's name?

1655
02:02:43,833 --> 02:02:45,933
Amanda.

1656
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:38,633
He called me.

1657
02:03:38,667 --> 02:03:40,467
The night before
the shooting,

1658
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:42,800
He called me.

1659
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:45,400
He told me not
to come to school
in the morning.

1660
02:03:45,433 --> 02:03:47,433
He told me he was going
to bring a gun,

1661
02:03:47,467 --> 02:03:49,700
And that he was going
to kill everyone.

1662
02:03:58,167 --> 02:04:00,800
I'm sorry,
I didn't believe him.

1663
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:03,133
I'm sorry
I didn't stop it.

1664
02:04:03,167 --> 02:04:05,433
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- Wait, Alicia.

1665
02:04:05,467 --> 02:04:07,967
Alicia,
it wasn't your fault!

1666
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,967
Well?!

1667
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,300
What are you waiting for?!
Arrest her!

1668
02:04:12,333 --> 02:04:14,167
Isn't that what you wanted
to hear?!

1669
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:20,967
Bring her back.

1670
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,133
I closed the investigation
three days ago.

1671
02:04:23,167 --> 02:04:24,933
It isn't
public knowledge yet.

1672
02:04:24,967 --> 02:04:27,967
There will be no arrest.

1673
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,833
Then why the hell
did you bring us here?

1674
02:04:30,867 --> 02:04:34,600
Because I'm a father,
and my kid will be your age
in less than a heartbeat,

1675
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:37,000
And as soon as he's old enough
to figure this out,

1676
02:04:37,033 --> 02:04:41,000
He's going to ask me what
it all means, and I don't know
what to tell him.

1677
02:04:41,033 --> 02:04:42,800
You're asking us?!
You're the adult!

1678
02:04:42,833 --> 02:04:44,900
You're supposed to have
all the answers!

1679
02:04:44,933 --> 02:04:48,867
I can't turn on my TV
without hearing somebody say
why they think it happened...

1680
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:51,933
- "too much violence on TV."
- "The national rifle
association."

1681
02:04:51,967 --> 02:04:54,600
- "He was teased too much."
- "Harassed by other students."

1682
02:04:54,633 --> 02:04:56,933
- "Guns without safety locks."
- "Guns without safety locks."

1683
02:04:56,967 --> 02:04:59,267
- "Violent rock lyrics."
- "Violent video games."

1684
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:01,200
- "Video games."
- "Pulp Fiction."

1685
02:05:01,233 --> 02:05:03,000
- "Pulp Fiction."
- "Natural born killers."

1686
02:05:03,033 --> 02:05:04,833
- "Hatred."
- "Cry for help."

1687
02:05:04,867 --> 02:05:06,667
- "A cry for help."
- "Culture of death."

1688
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:09,767
- "Culture of death."
- "Be on the cover of
'time' magazine."

1689
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:13,267
My head can't even hold
all the answers I hear
every single day!

1690
02:05:14,333 --> 02:05:15,867
Cathy:
"'Time' magazine."

1691
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,800
Deanna:
So, now you come to us

1692
02:05:17,833 --> 02:05:19,967
Because you want
to know why?

1693
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,700
You want to know
what it means?

1694
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,967
It doesn't mean
a goddamn thing in the world.

1695
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,800
* it doesn't mean much

1696
02:05:33,833 --> 02:05:38,500
* it doesn't mean
anything at all *

1697
02:05:39,833 --> 02:05:43,133
* the life I've left
behind me *

1698
02:05:43,167 --> 02:05:45,867
* is a cold room

1699
02:05:46,933 --> 02:05:50,267
* I've crossed
the last line *

1700
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:55,900
* from where I can't turn

1701
02:05:55,933 --> 02:06:01,100
* where every step I took
in faith *

1702
02:06:01,133 --> 02:06:02,700
* betrayed me

1703
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:12,167
* and led me
from my home *

1704
02:06:13,633 --> 02:06:22,567
* sweet surrender

1705
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:29,067
* is all that I had
to give *

1706
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,467
* you take me in

1707
02:06:33,933 --> 02:06:37,733
* no questions asked

1708
02:06:39,233 --> 02:06:45,200
* you strip away the ugliness
that surrounds me *

1709
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,600
* are you an angel?

1710
02:06:50,933 --> 02:06:54,500
* am I already that gone?

1711
02:06:55,933 --> 02:07:02,733
* I only hope that I won't
disappoint you *

1712
02:07:04,167 --> 02:07:10,667
* when I'm down here
on my knees *

1713
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:22,133
* sweet surrender

1714
02:07:22,167 --> 02:07:25,300
* is all that I have
to give *

1715
02:07:30,167 --> 02:07:39,167
* sweet surrender

1716
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:43,333
* is all that I have
to give *

1717
02:07:46,933 --> 02:07:49,267
* and I don't understand

1718
02:07:50,933 --> 02:07:54,700
* how the touch
of your hand *

1719
02:07:56,767 --> 02:08:01,033
* I will be
the one to fall *

1720
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,667
* I miss the little things

1721
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:17,167
* I miss everything
about you *

1722
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,667
* it doesn't mean much

1723
02:08:24,333 --> 02:08:28,333
* it doesn't mean
anything at all *

1724
02:08:29,833 --> 02:08:33,400
* the life
I've left behind me *

1725
02:08:33,433 --> 02:08:36,100
* is a cold room

1726
02:08:38,167 --> 02:08:47,133
* sweet surrender

1727
02:08:47,167 --> 02:08:52,667
* is all that I have
to give *

1728
02:08:54,933 --> 02:09:04,300
* sweet surrender

1729
02:09:04,333 --> 02:09:10,167
* is all that I have
to give. *

1730
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,900
* the silicon chip
inside her head *

1731
02:10:23,933 --> 02:10:26,567
* gets switched
to overload *

1732
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:30,567
* and nobody's gonna go
to school today *

1733
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,900
* she's gonna make them
stay at home *

1734
02:10:33,933 --> 02:10:37,333
* and daddy doesn't
understand it *

1735
02:10:37,367 --> 02:10:40,233
* he always said
she was good as gold *

1736
02:10:40,267 --> 02:10:42,233
* and he can see
no reasons *

1737
02:10:42,267 --> 02:10:44,233
* 'cause there are
no reasons *

1738
02:10:44,267 --> 02:10:48,833
* what reason do you need
to be shown? *

1739
02:10:48,867 --> 02:10:52,433
* tell me why
I don't like mondays *

1740
02:10:52,467 --> 02:10:55,833
* tell me why
I don't like mondays *

1741
02:10:55,867 --> 02:10:58,167

02:11:00,167 --> 02:11:02,267
