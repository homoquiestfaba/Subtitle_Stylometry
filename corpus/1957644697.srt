46

of Catherine the Great of Russia.

was this insatiable nymphomaniac

59
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:03,511
- One day Catherine decided

60
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,153
that she wanted to make it with a horse.

61
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:07,812
- A horse?

62
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:09,265
- Yeah, a horse.

63
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,767
So she had the palace engineers

64
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,493
build this tremendous
harness above her bed

65
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:15,243
so that they could lower
the horse to hoist--

66
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:16,635
- That's sick.

67
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,758
Did she actually do it with a horse?

68
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,958
- Oh no, the horse fell and
it crushed her to death.

69
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,728
- Oh god, what a horrible way to go.

70
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,309

71
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,951

her riding boots on.

77

and I was regressed back to
my last three incarnations.

78
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,533
- God that sounds pretty wild.

79
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:38,037
So who were you in your past lives?

80
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,626
- Well let's see.

81
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:43,709
From 1774 to 1798 I was
a Zulu warrior in Africa.

82
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,787
- Didn't live too long that time did you?

83
00:05:48,787 --> 00:05:52,458
- Oh no, it was a jungle out there.

84
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,541
Oh and from 1806 to 1867,

85
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,807
I was a promiscuous southern belle

86
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,474
on a Carolina cotton plantation.

87
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,993
- Who were you after that?

88
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,579
- A nun in Vatican City.

89
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,848
- Huh.

90
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:11,932
Tell me about the
promiscuous southern belle.

91
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:15,087
- You know, I thought you'd
ask me about that one.

92
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,876
My name was Nelly.

93
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,793
Nelly Anastasia Rydell.

94
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:22,971
(magical music)

95
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:27,562
My father, Obadiah Rydell
made a fortune growing cotton

96
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:31,204
for a French woman's
underpants manufacturer.

97
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:34,134
One morning when I was about 21 years old,

98
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:37,304
I was sipping a mint julep on the veranda,

99
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,159
a gentleman caller I'd
come to know quite well

100
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,822
came a calling.

101
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:45,091
He was a Frenchman named Hugh Hardone.

102
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:47,501
Monsieur Hardone was the buyer

103
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:51,582
for the underwear
manufacturer over in France.

104
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:56,087
He'd come back by my by, very
often to check the crops.

105
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:58,222
Making sure the cotton was good quality

106
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:01,426
befitting fine ladies underpants.

107
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:04,462
Hugh didn't speak the
English language very well

108
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:06,739
so we developed this sort of uh,

109
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:08,322
romantic shorthand.

110
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:12,893
Knowing my daddy was
out plowing the fields,

111
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:17,210
Hugh wasted no time making
his intentions known.

112
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,637
We went upstairs to the room
at the tip top of the house.

113
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:24,804
There were windows all around
looking out into the trees.

114
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,903
We pretended we were a couple of squirrels

115
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:30,951
jumping branches outside,

116
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,619
gathering nuts for the
long, lonely winter.

117
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:37,190
Like the gentleman that he was

118
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,489
Hugh helped me disrobe out
of the cumbersome apparel

119
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:43,317
that was fashion of the times.

120
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,734
(rock music)

121
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,930
- Did you ever see Hugh Hardone again?

122
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,097
- No, his ship sunk off the
coast of the Canary Islands.

123
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,777
Yeah he went down with
1,100 bales of cotton.

124
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:11,286
Yeah, well virgin cotton,

125
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:15,933
which is much more than I
can say for myself my dear.

126
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,139
- Quite, what a sad ending.

127
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,717
- Not really.

128
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,534

156

- Uh, no way.

157
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,253
I mean if I found out
that I was someone like

158
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:17,146
Catherine the Great or someone like that,

159
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,829
then I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

160
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,756
- Well the way I see
it, it wasn't her fault

161
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,298
she died an ignoble death.

162

184
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,449
- Rough at the orifice dear?

185
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:54,304
- Oh I see we have a fledgling
chlamydian in our midst.

186
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:58,670
So, you think proctology
is a joke do you...

00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,194

funny bones gets tickled

191

gratuitous form of entertainment.

300
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:18,952

had a hard on Valerie.

301

- No, I can't say that I have.

302

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,157

- Oh Hugh it's been so long.

313
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,348
I just think I'll have to give
you a little French lesson

314
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,386
that you'll never forgot.

315
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:09,303
- Oh Sally.

316
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,067
Are you sure this is French?

317
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,552
I always thought it was Latin.

318
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:18,229
- Oh you just hold your horses there Hugh.

319
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,912
Or I'm gonna give you a
crash course in Greek.

320
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:26,079
- (moans) Frankly my
dear I don't give a damn.

321
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:30,158
- What's my toilet training

322
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:34,030
got to do with my aversion
toward cunnilingus?

323
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,079
- Are you two talking
about me behind my back?

324
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,246
- No, we were just discussing
Ron's personal eating habits.

325
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,833
- Valerie listen, can I have
a word with Ron alone please.

326
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,230
- Sure.

327
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,397
Maybe a little lip service
will do you both some good.

328
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,293
- Ron.

329
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:58,940
I want all the lingerie I
left at your apartment back.

330
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,607
- I, I'm sorry Gina.

331
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,911
I washed my car this week

332
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,036
and I didn't have anything
else to dry it off with.

333
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:07,981
- What?

334
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:09,229

335
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:12,252

336
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,262

337
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,619
Look, Gina this is probably
bad timing on my part but,

338
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,981
I want us to get back together again.

339
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:20,332

340

341
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,435
Not.

770
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:40,001
You should wash your
mouth out with soap doc.

- Hmm, take me to your igloo
Doctor Nanook of the North.

779
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,000
- Yeah, the nasal passages

780

seem to be in perfect running order.

781
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:26,911

782
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:29,377
Aren't you gonna check my throat doc?

783
00:43:29,377 --> 00:43:30,294

784
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,998
That's something I'm afraid

785
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:37,656

into a little deeper

you think it will take

to perform this physical?

811
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:00,368
- Depends on the erectability variable

812
00:45:00,368 --> 00:45:02,368
of the examining doctor.

813
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,423
- So why'd you break up
with your boyfriend Gina?

814
00:45:07,423 --> 00:45:10,177
- Well he couldn't satisfy me in bed.

815
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:13,596
You know Ron had no problem
with me giving him head

reverse the polarities

818
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:20,660
he complained about terminal lockjaw.

819
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,222
- So Ron why did Gina
break up with you man?

820
00:45:23,222 --> 00:45:24,923
