1
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,588
Ah, the last day of the school year

2
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:08,260
Today is the day we seniors celebrate
graduation and move on with our lives

3
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:15,132
It's also the day the entire campus takes part
in the annual 24 hour party starting at 6 AM

4
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,336
I love it here at college

5
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,538
That's me and my twin brother Evan

6
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:24,209
Evan and I are part of a fraternity and
not just any fraternity - Iota Gamma Chi

7
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,043
By far the wildest fraternity on campus

8
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,151
We're celebrating the last day
in true academic form

9
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,220
Starting off with a traditional
6 AM pajama party

10
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,189
Then a pig roast in the afternoon

11
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,989
If we aren't passed out yet
we'll go take a couple final exams

12
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:46,123
Tonight we'll activate the pledges
and throw one last kick ass party

13
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,996
Sounds great huh

14
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,103
My brother and I
are so fucking depressed

15
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,573
We've been dreading this day for 4 years

16
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,939
We don't want to graduate

17
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,774
This is officially the worst day
of our entire lives

18
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,496
Where the fuck is Jake and Evan

19
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,664
I think they're sleeping

20
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,828
Sleeping? It's 6 AM, time to party

21
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,704
Yeah! Let's go get 'em

22
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,040
Wake up bitches

23
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,242
Get drunk, let's get drunk

24
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,111
Wake up bitches

25
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,012
Whoo, yeah, party

26
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,051
Hey, you guys this is the
final day of the college year

27
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,353
Also known as the
last day of college partying

28
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,524
Make the most of it; honestly this time next year
you're going to wish you were back in college

29
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,494
Party, yeah
The girls are here

30
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,729
No kidding, where the hell have you been

31
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,131
I just woke up

32
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,633
Scooter, you might
make it to first base today

33
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,336
That's very funny Keggar, you know,
just kick me while I'm down.

34
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,470
Today is your day Scooter

35
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,906
I need to get laid;
I have never gotten laid

36
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,975
I know

37
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,001
Come get some; let's get drunk

38
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,581
Hey honestly, this is your last day of
college partying for the rest of your lives.

39
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,549
Make the most of it

40
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:29,117
Hello, hey dad.

41
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,262
What

42
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,062
No, some of the guys downstairs
are just playing some music

43
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,058
Drinking

44
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,470
No, it's only 6 AM dad

45
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:50,976
Yeah, you know I just don't know if Evan
and I want to go into the banking business

46
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,551
Yes Sir

47
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,485
No, sir

48
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,886
O.K., we'll see you and
Mom early tomorrow then

49
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,454
Alright, sir

50
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,048
Jake, Evan, want some beerios

51
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,160
I'll take some beerios
Alright

52
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,597
No, no, no beerios; come dance with us

53
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,067
Hey Brandon, you

54
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,435
Nope, but I got some
shots for ya' you fucking pussies

55
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,307
Yeah, O.K., they're coming
to dance with us anyway

56
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,242
I'm not dancing

57
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,410
No, no we don't wanna dance

58
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,071
No dancing

59
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,213
Hey girls, you want to

60
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,944
Oh my God, O.K., O.K., O.K.

61
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,078
Ready, 1, 2, 3

62
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,558
Maybe we could dance a little bit

63
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,393
Dancing is my favorite pastime

64
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,758
I love dancing

65
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:16,668
Hey, this is awkward,
but I'm just going to say it

66
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:22,140
My friend told me that you think I'm cute and
I think you are, like, the hottest guy on campus

67
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,443
I've had a crush on you, like, all year

68
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:32,284
Really, Oh my God, I, I've been trying to ask
you out all year, but I couldn't figure out how

69
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,353
You're really hot

70
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:41,019
Um, I'm not talking to you;
I'm on the phone

71
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh my God, this really
creepy guy just tried...

72
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,798
Man, this is bull

73
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,374
This is bullshit, 6 freaking AM and I'm
running around like a jerk serving drinks

74
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,409
You know what, I'm out of here

75
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,245
Hold on, hold on, this is the last day

76
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,646
You're not quitting now

77
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,281
Alright man, Alright

78
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,080
I don't know why I'm doing this though
I mean do you

79
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,019
I don't know Respect, Brotherhood

80
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,224
My dad was a Gamma Chi, so if Iwant him to
pay for my schooling I have to become one

81
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,716
You really believe all that shit

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,030
You really believe all that shit John

83
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,198
About brotherhood and all that

84
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,166
Yes I do

85
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,795
These guys are great guys

86
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,630
We just need to get
through pledging, you'll see

87
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,609
That's not why I'm here

88
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,077
So why the hell are you here

89
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,445
What, are you serious

90
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,447
Pussy man, pussy

91
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,651
Shoot, this frat gets laid
more than any other frat on campus

92
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,019
And you know what I'm talking about

93
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,782
Yeah that's right

94
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,654
Hey, Hey, check out
my boy Adam over there

95
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,451
And you know what I'm talking about

96
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,631
Ah, here you go Jeff

97
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,962
Thank you sir

98
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,924
Yeah
You good

99
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,343
Do you want to go up to my room

100
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,445
I don't know, what for

101
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,980
So I can show you my baseball bat

102
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,550
Ah, is it a Louisville Slugger

103
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,518
Nope, it's a Hong Kong Slugger

104
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,487
It's a much bigger city

105
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,657
Well, do you have any condoms

106
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,524
Oh yeah

107
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,617
Alright, let's go

108
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,266
Um, hi

109
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,335
I live here

110
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,170
So,

111
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:35,373
Ah, you want to see my room

112
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,409
What for

113
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,312
Well, I, I, I, want
to show you my bowling ball

114
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,280
Oh, how many balls do you have

115
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,982
Just the one

116
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,084
What's up Stephanie

117
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,850
Oh, just talking to the Uni-baller here

118
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,926
Let's go
Anytime you're ready old man

119
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,166
Keggar my friend

120
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,601
You do not deserve to be called Keggar

121
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,731
Compared to me you're just little old Jason
who can't drink with the big boys

122
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,608
This isn't 1999 anymore

123
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,043
I'm the fastest in the frat now

124
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,713
Fossil, I need your help

125
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,682
Ah, I'm a little busy right now

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,020
Can we please do this

128
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,546
Pa Pa Patience boy

129
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,459
Continue
I don't want to say

130
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,227
Well then you don't get any help

131
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,753
Today

132
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,689
Look, I can't get laid

133
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,103
Just forget it

134
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:41,072
No, no, you know who has
2 thumbs that can help you get laid

135
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,507
This guy

136
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,677
So, hey, swing by my room a
little bit later and I'll help you out

137
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,078
Alright when

138
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,113
Whenever, later

139
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,117
Sure, ah I'm picking up
a 90 pound pig at 10:00

140
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,318
Why don't you come by at 11?

141
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,419
11, alright thanks

142
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,587
No problem

143
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,689
Can we please do this old dude

144
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,926
Son, I'm going to teach you a
lesson in respecting your elders

145
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:06,022
Elders, more like
social security recipient

146
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,633
Now if you don't mind my
lady, you can count us down

147
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,571
Ready, set, drink

148
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,597
Go, Go, Go

149
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,509
Done

150
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,391
No, we can't your roommate will hear

151
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,452
So what, I'm going to tell him anyway

152
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,023
It wasn't enough time

153
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,425
What

154
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,693
4 years

155
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,562
4 years of college
and that's all you get

156
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,600
You think it's going to
last forever, but it's not

157
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,538
Between today and the day we die
we never get to go to college again

158
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,041
I walked around campus all last night

159
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,042
Yeah

160
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,278
Everything seemed different

161
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,946
I know

162
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,349
The building the quad,
none if it seemed right

163
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,619
It's like they tell you, you know,
find a major that interests you for a career

164
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:16,961
Nothing interests me,
I don't want a fucking career

165
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,589
You know what I want my career to be

166
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,201
Playing soccer for the school team

167
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,137
Making out with chicks

168
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,439
You know, drinking beer

169
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,075
Walking around with my
shirt off all day like an idiot

170
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,045
That's what I want my career to be

171
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,380
You know what it is

172
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,649
Suddenly we don't belong here anymore

173
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,985
For 4 years they tell us
this is your home

174
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,114
And then one day you wake up
and you don't belong here anymore

175
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,257
You know what I feel like

176
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,125
Yeah

177
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,127
I feel like Lucifer

178
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,330
I feel like Michael is
chucking me out of paradise

179
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,765
This is the worst day of my life

180
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,369
That was dad on the phone

181
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,108
They're letting us stay at home for the summer
while we learn the banking business

182
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,579
Oh yeah, that sounds horrible

183
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Their picking us up at 6 A.M.

184
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,548
6 A.M.

185
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,574
You know dad, he likes to
get an early start

186
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,155
I can't do it bro'

187
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,489
I can't and I won't

188
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,450
I'm not leaving

189
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,229
What are you talking about

190
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,297
I'm not leaving and neither are you

191
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,600
Dad ain't paying for
another year of college

192
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,702
You got 20 grand because I don't

193
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,038
The school charges rent, you know

194
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,374
I'm not getting a job Evan

195
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,443
We won't get real jobs

196
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,247
We'll coach soccer at the
local soccer camp this summer

197
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,049
Evan, you're my brother and I love you

198
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,983
I'm not leaving you behind

199
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:49,988
You're really staying

200
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,055
I'm not going anywhere

201
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,420
This is my home

202
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,626
How are we going to pull it off

203
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,563
I have no idea, but I know
I can't do it without you bro'

204
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,099
We in this together, 50-50

205
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,092
O.K. man, I mean, I'm
with you one hundred percent

206
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,040
I don't know how we're
staying, but we're staying

207
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,377
Maybe we'll leave
college one day, but not today

208
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,846
Not today

209
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,917
Evan and I had less than 24 hours
to secure ourselves a 5th year

210
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,585
We knew we needed some help

211
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,421
And if there was one guy in
our fraternity that could help us

212
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,423
It was Greg Karanoski

213
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,159
The guy had been in
college for close to a decade

214
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,627
He was a legend

215
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,392
We called him Fossil

216
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,199
So, we figured if anyone
could help us it would be you

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,602
You figured right fellas

218
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,570
I'm an 8 year senior

219
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,439
Triple major, quadruple minor

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,442
Currently majoring in the
breeding habits of advanced primates

221
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,047
Basically, I have a quarter million dollars
of education crammed into this skull

222
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,316
Alright Fossil, we don't need
your credentials

223
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,484
Just tell us how we do it,
how do we stay

224
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,681
How to stay

225
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,625
Gentleman, the following
are sacred rules

226
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,127
Fossil's commandments if you will

227
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,197
Rule number 1;
No summer classes ever

228
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,099
The campus is dead and nobody is around

229
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,934
And you're even
getting closer to graduation

230
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,402
Stupid

231
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,506
Secondly, I want the two
of you to enroll in Trigonometry

232
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:19,344
Trig is arguably the hardest
course that this college has to offer

233
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,613
Wait, wait, wait why do we
want to sign up for a hard class

234
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:27,352
Because, even your parents are
scared to death of Trigonometry

235
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,686
Therefore, they will be supportive
and understanding when you fail

236
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,091
Obviously, rule number 2

237
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,326
Take Trigonometry
as many times as possible

238
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,363
I have personally failed Trigonometry 5 times

239
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,465
Now that's 15 credit hours

240
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,369
I personally owe an entire
extra semester to Trigonometry

241
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,337
Wow

242
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,438
Rule number 3

243
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,973
Beer is your friend

244
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,542
The more you drink the more
you'll get out of the college experience

245
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,046
However, somewhere around
your 3rd senior year

246
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,081
You should check yourself
into rehab for alcoholism

247
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,516
But don't worry
Your parents won't be angry

248
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,186
I mean you're just a poor, young,
impressionable soul with a problem

249
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,156
They'll actually think you're growing up
because you're seeking help

250
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,959
Besides, at rehab the food is phenomenal

251
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,028
And the babes, they're fucking sluts

252
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,429
Tell Pam I said hi

253
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,198
Alright dude, this is all great stuff

254
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,333
But we don't have any time

255
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,903
We're being picked up
in 20, 19 hours

256
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,371
Do you have any tests left

257
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,509
Yeah, we have our
history 404 final at noon

258
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,277
Fail it

259
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:27,111
What

260
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,013
Fossil rule number 4

261
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,248
Fail your last test

262
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,551
Your parents have already paid
for 99% of your college education

263
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,121
Do you really think they are going to call it
quits because you've come 3 credits shy

264
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,222
Fuck no

265
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,260
Fail your last test and you'll be right back here
next year taking that same class again in the fall

266
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,428
Dude that might work

267
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,096
Of course it will work

268
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,432
Ah dude thanks Fossil

269
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,100
Fossil you're awesome

270
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,201
Hey, no problem

271
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,002
Now, are we alright here guys

272
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,371
Absolutely, thanks dude

273
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,407
Alright, I don't want to be rude but
I'm going to ask you guys to run along

274
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,242
Scooter's got an 11 o'clock booked

275
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,506
Ah, Scooter you out there

276
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,017
Get back here you pussies, get

277
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,519
Can't leave until the keg is finished

278
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,021
Get back here

279
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,717
You, pledge

280
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,329
Why don't you drink
you skirt wearing pussy

281
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,565
Shove it up your ass bitch

282
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,398
Give me those chips

283
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,106
Give me those chips

284
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,838
Ah, Fuck

285
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,878
I'll shove 'em down your throat

286
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,071
Fuck, Fuck

287
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,712
Give me those chips

288
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,424
Hey, Kegger is getting laid

289
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,658
Yeah, give it to her Kegger

290
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,787
Whoa, is that chick French

291
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,997
Holy shit

292
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,988
They're fags

293
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,506
We're spinning our wheels here Scooter

294
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,574
It's either you're going to
take my advice or you're not

295
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,976
I can't help you if you're too scared

296
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,444
I can't

297
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,614
Sure you can you just
have to be smooth on the phone

298
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,516
I can't

299
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,284
Women can smell fear

300
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,453
That's why it's important
that you act like you don't care

301
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,654
if she's fucking the entire football team

302
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Because you my friend are
having sex with the cheerleading squad

303
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,226
The pom squad, their younger sisters,
their grandmas at home

304
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:28,366
Everyone in the entire arena
for you fuck her, fuck her

305
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,061
I can't do it Fossil

306
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,904
Scooter, of course you can

307
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,174
I'm going to show you this once,
but only this one time, O.K.

308
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,475
Yeah

309
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,644
Now, I'm going to show you,
but you have to pay attention

310
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,013
Now, what's this girl's name

311
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,914
Kerry

312
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,215
And what's her number

313
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:49,483
616-555-3836

314
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,191
Wait, you're not
going to call her are you

315
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,292
You want to get laid don't you

316
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,227
No, I mean yeah, I, I, I mean

317
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,496
Alright, now you want to
go out on a date with this girl

318
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,895
Let me set it up

319
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,732
It's ringing

320
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,534
Answering machine

321
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,435
No, hang up hang up

322
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,868
No, no, no, I got this

323
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,007
Hey Kerry, this is Greg
over at the Gamma Chi house

324
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,375
Um, I'm just hanging
out with my buddy Scooter

325
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,478
And he was just telling me what
a beautiful smile he thinks you have

326
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,248
And on top of that he went down to
the gallery and saw some of your work

327
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,483
Now he can't stop talking
about how talented he thinks you are

328
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,087
Well, anyway we are over here just watching
my younger brother and his puppy

329
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,690
Well, anyway if you're interested in
swinging by with some of your friends

330
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,225
Why don't you give me a call

331
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,195
555-9452, talk to you then bye

332
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:37,268
You're going to get laid tonight
Scooter, panties are going to drop, drop

333
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,104
Dude, we don't have a puppy

334
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,474
Who cares, women being lied to

335
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,509
Hey, as long as I get laid

336
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,612
Laid, oh you will get laid

337
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,113
I think I know this chick

338
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,215
She's put on the old freshmen
15 but let me tell ya

339
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,183
Total freak

340
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,756
O.K. time is up

341
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,159
Put your pencils down and past
your test to the left and forward

342
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,530
Results of the test will
be posted outside my office

343
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,698
I'm going to go to lunch now

344
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,134
When I get back I'm going to
put all these through the scantron

345
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,137
So, the results should be
up in about 2 hours

346
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,106
For all you juniors out there
have a great summer

347
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:20,111
Seniors, finally your wait is over
and you can join the workforce

348
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,443
Good luck to you all

349
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,589
How did you do on the test

350
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,091
I think I might have got a D minus

351
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,459
Ah, I wouldn't worry about it

352
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,163
You probably came through
with a well deserved F

353
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,331
Yeah, you're right I failed

354
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,966
That's what I'm talking about

355
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,101
Coming back next year bro'

356
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,170
5th year, baby

357
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,204
5th year

358
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,765
Let's go get some fucking chicks

359
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,261
Hey, was that you mud wrestling

360
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,262
Yeah

361
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,731
I saw that shit it was bad ass

362
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:26,504
Hey, what did you get on the test

363
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,338
Winston

364
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,305
What's up fellas

365
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,440
What's up

366
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,512
I'm pretty sure I aced the test and because
my good old boy Brandon copied off of mine

367
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,147
I'm pretty sure he aced it to

368
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,315
You aced the test, yeah right

369
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:42,186
Bro, just because I can
drink twice as much beer as you

370
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,522
And bang twice as many chicks as you

371
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,525
Does not mean that
I'm not a 4.0 History major

372
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,461
Hey, my man Winston here
could ace that test in his sleep

373
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,562
I think I did

374
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,596
What's that

375
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:57,268
Ah, Um, Look you guys want to know
what the correct answers were on the test

376
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,970
Yeah, tell me what was
the answer to number 7

377
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,541
Um, 7 is uh Costa Rica

378
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,109
I got Costa Rica

379
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,010
Me too

380
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,546
Hey, what did you get for
the last one, 1847

381
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,147
Yup, Yup

382
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,683
What about the first one, what
was your answer on the first one.

383
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:18,222
First one, the, uh, Belize 1472

384
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,850
Oh shit

385
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,195
Look who cares about the test boys

386
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,755
C'mon let's party

387
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,601
Here's the thing, we
tried to throw the test

388
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,103
But the answers we thought
were wrong were right

389
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,004
We should have studied more

390
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,441
Wait, why would we study
for a test we were trying to fail

391
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,213
Because you have to know what the right
answers are in order to pick the wrong ones

392
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,875
Why did you 2 numbnuts even
show up for the exam anyway

393
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,588
Well, so what do we do now Fossil

394
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,491
Fossil rule number 5

395
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,227
Cheat, when all else fails just cheat

396
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,496
Dude it's too late to cheat

397
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,898
And when even cheating fails to work

398
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,266
Rule number 6

399
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,467
Steal the test

400
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:07,137
Now, logically you would
want to do this before the test

401
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,607
But somehow the two of
you have been defying logic

402
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,376
What I need you to do is
break into your professor's office

403
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,579
Steal the test and change all of
your right answer to the wrong ones

404
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,281
What if we get caught

405
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,451
What if you get caught,
who the fuck cares

406
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,186
What's the worst that can happen to you

407
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,615
They kick you out of school
They're kicking you out tomorrow anyway

408
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,926
Um, what the fuck
you guys looking at me for

409
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:29,994
I don't have the test

410
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,828
Get out of here you are
interrupting my espresso time

411
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,001
Pick the lock
What?

412
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,070
Pick the lock

413
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,505
What the hell do I know
about picking locks

414
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,473
I thought you knew karate

415
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,009
I got a yellow belt at
the YMCA like 12 years ago

416
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,178
And I don't know what
that has to do with anything

417
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,179
Use your keys then

418
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,581
Use my keys to do what

419
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,549
To pick the lock

420
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,918
I'm pretty sure I don't
have the key to his office

421
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,453
And I don't think the
wrong key is going to work

422
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,388
That's the entire idea behind keys

423
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,423
Use your credit card

424
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,949
Dad cut up our credit cards

425
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,011
Friday 11:22 a.m.

426
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,382
Hey Kerry this is Greg
over at the Gamma Chi house

427
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,150
Um, I'm just hanging out
with my buddy Scooter

428
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,020
And he was just telling me what
a beautiful smile he thinks you have

429
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,490
And on top of that he went down to
the gallery and saw some of your work

430
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,892
Now he can't stop talking about
how talented he thinks you are

431
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,463
Well, anyway we are over here just watching
my younger brother and his puppy

432
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,633
Well, anyway if you're interested in
swinging by with some of your friends

433
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,600
Why don't you give me a call

434
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,571
555-9452, talk to you then bye

435
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:26,510
You're going to get laid tonight
Scooter, panties are going to drop, drop

436
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,446
Dude, we don't have a puppy

437
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,983
Who cares, women love being lied to

438
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,019
Hey, as long as I get laid

439
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,254
Laid, oh you will get laid

440
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,389
I think I know this chick

441
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,457
She's put on the old freshmen
15 but let me tell ya

442
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,823
Total freak

443
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,706
Scooter

444
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,581
Hey Kerry, hey did you get my message

445
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,417
Yeah you know I sure did

446
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:09,050
I'm really glad you could make it
We have some beer over here

447
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:14,323
Goal

448
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,903
Adam, those are holier than thous

449
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,938
Dude, some of them are hot

450
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:32,276
Um, is that alcohol
that everyone is drinking

451
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,011
Yeah, do you want one or not

452
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,280
I thought you said this was a barbeque

453
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,515
It is a barbeque, do you want one

454
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,583
We don't drink

455
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,584
Why not

456
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,119
We're Christians

457
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,955
Unpucker your assholes

458
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,990
Uh, why that is the rudest

459
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,994
You know Jesus turned
water into wine not mango juice

460
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,464
I'll have a beer

461
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,233
Jane
What, he's right

462
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,336
You know, Christian girls
are best on their knees

463
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,371
You know we should
get that put on a T-shirt

464
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,066
Shut up Jane

465
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,112
I'm thinking about
going to the new gym in town

466
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,147
They have a lot more free weights there

467
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,516
They would let me in for free also

468
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,085
It's good for them to have
a big guy like me there

469
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,886
I'm putting up like 310, 325

470
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,561
Ah, I need another beer
It was nice talking to you though

471
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,497
Wait a minute, hold on

472
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,131
Pledges

473
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,102
Can't you see this women needs a beer

474
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,370
I'm fine really

475
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,972
Get her a beer now

476
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,907
You two give me 20 push ups

477
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,943
Why

478
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,612
Because I said so that's why

479
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,646
Make it 50

480
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,181
Jerk

481
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,017
Great, make it 100

482
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,318
Just go until I say stop

483
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,388
I'm not getting laid now because of
you two little cock blocks

484
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,023
Wait until you meet The General

485
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,992
The General is coming tonight

486
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,758
You, poor that beer down your dress

487
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,405
Kerry was just over at the barbeque

488
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,441
She came right up to me
and kicked me in the balls

489
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,543
Your plan sucked

490
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,444
Dude, calm down

491
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,646
This is great news

492
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,681
How is that possibly great news

493
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,585
Scooter, it is the primal instinct for the
female to kick the male in the genitalia

494
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,919
When ready to mate

495
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,123
This is basically a sign that the female
has chosen her male to reproduce with

496
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,625
Fossil that is the biggest load
of shit I have ever heard

497
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,694
Remember I am an A student in my major

498
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,262
Breeding habits of advanced primates

499
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,298
I'm like the Dahli fucking Lama of this shit

500
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,699
You're an A student

501
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,268
Well, I'm a student

502
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,704
Yeah, right let's move on

503
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,406
Look, you screwed things up

504
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:43,940
It's all right
I screwed up

505
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,410
What did I do,
I did what you told me to do

506
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,178
Scooter, have you ever seen
a women naked

507
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,681
Yeah, yeah of course I have

508
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,549
Who, when, where

509
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,686
You know, on the uh

510
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,323
T.V., magazines, the internet

511
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,524
You know, lots of times dude

512
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,927
Oh boy, looks like you're going to
need a little more help than I thought

513
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,196
I'm going to have to really reach
into the bag of tricks for this one

514
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,465
Do you have anyone else in mind

515
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,133
I don't know

516
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,336
I want to get laid

517
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,971
But I really like Kerry

518
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,372
You've already screwed
things up with Kerry

519
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,374
Do you have anything else in mind

520
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,643
Well I don't know if I want anyone else
Fossil

521
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,944
I mean I really like her

522
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,346
Oh, that's cute

523
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,580
Now, man up, grab your sack

524
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,140
And let's figure out how to
get your dipstick into some oil

525
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,557
Alright, we'll need some tight shirts

526
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,160
Expensive shoes, tight pair of jeans

527
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,495
Maybe a little man perfume

528
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,030
Huh, What am I going to
need that stuff for

529
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,598
Because you're going to pretend to be gay

530
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,201
What, no Fossil
Fuck no

531
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,503
Scooter, I pretended to be
gay my entire 3rd senior year

532
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,638
I got laid more than carpet

533
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,208
You meet a girl, become best friends

534
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,643
Go shopping, maybe get a facial

535
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,543
And then you give them the line

536
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,545
I could never imagine myself with a woman

537
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,946
Next thing you know
they're on top of you

538
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,388
Congratulations bro,
for the second time

539
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,518
Who would of thought failing
a test would be so much work

540
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,128
Hey Jeff, Jeff

541
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,064
What happened to your skirt man

542
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,601
Sir, Pledge Master Kegger instructed
me to pour beer down my pants, sir

543
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,069
Alright, that's enough with the sir business

544
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,464
You can just call me Jake
Alright

545
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,472
Man, that Kegger guy
is a complete asshole

546
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,507
Yeah, he can be

547
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,476
But you didn't hear that from us

548
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:30,247
Jeff go up into my room and
grab yourself a clean pair of pants

549
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,048
Thanks you, sir

550
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,050
Uh, Jake, thanks

551
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,419
Are we going to have to
really drown a kitten tonight

552
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,320
Come here

553
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,589
Do you really think that my brother
and I would be in this frat if we did

554
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,525
Look, it's going to be tough tonight

555
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:42,960
But you're going to get through it

556
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,261
And it's going to be totally worth it

557
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,595
Thanks a lot guys

558
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,730
Can I get you guys a beer

559
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,032
Yeah sure I'll take another brew

560
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,500
Yeah, me too
Take your time

561
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,025
Thanks guys

562
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,994
Hey babe I'm Freddie

563
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,229
I like your style sexy

564
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,266
Um, look it's not what it looks like alright

565
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,701
It's alright honey

566
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,636
I had trouble coming
out of the closet for years

567
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,038
I'm not in the closet

568
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,440
I don't even own a closet

569
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,637
You know I have one of those poles
on my wall to hang my clothes on

570
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,180
Look this is just a plan O.K.

571
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,082
I'm not gay I'm trying to get laid

572
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,450
Will you please just let me go

573
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,619
Hey, take it easy

574
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,420
We just met

575
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,355
Let's take things a little slower

576
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,983
And there will be plenty of time for lovin

577
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,529
Oh yeah

578
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,498
Hey guys do you want one

579
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,268
One what exactly

580
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,430
Hey common let's go
and make sure we failed

581
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,409
Are the hot dogs done yet

582
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,639
No baby and neither are you

583
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,132
Alright people excuse me pardon me

584
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,133
Hey what the fuck

585
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,670
Frat boys, what are you doing

586
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,605
Hey my name is on that

587
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,340
My grade's on there

588
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,866
We need to see our grade

589
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,380
You said Winston was a History major

590
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,314
He is a History major

591
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,650
Hey, then why didn't he know
any of the right answers to the test

592
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,319
You're a History major why
didn't you know any of the wrong ones

593
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,387
Ah shut up Evan

594
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,355
Dude you wanted to take History
in the first place

595
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,957
Yeah, to take it not to pass it

596
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,226
Fuck you know we had all
the answers wrong and we failed

597
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,728
But we had to go back and
change all the answers because of you

598
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,031
You wanted to change them to Jake

599
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,067
Yeah, but I wouldn't have wanted to if you
hadn't have talked to Winston in the first place

600
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,268
Dude we both talked to Winston

601
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,471
Winston came up to both of us and said hi

602
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,736
No, you went up to Winston and
said hey what did you get on the test

603
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,943
Yeah

604
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,145
Fuck
Sorry

605
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:19,912
You know were like 13, 14 hours away
from becoming financial bankers

606
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,881
Let's go see Fossil

607
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,357
So let me see if I'm getting this here

608
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,659
You originally had all the answers wrong

609
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,528
But for some reason
thought you had all the answers right

610
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,030
So you broke into your professor's office
Stole the test

611
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,600
Changed all your answers to
what you thought were the wrong answers

612
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,503
But actually changed them to the
right answers and then passed the test

613
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,670
Am I getting this

614
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,073
Yeah that about covers it

615
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,142
How in the fuck is that possible

616
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,643
I have no idea

617
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,178
What did you get

618
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,079
A-

619
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,147
Straight A

620
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,948
So what do we do now

621
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,217
Alright, I didn't want to
have to go in this direction

622
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,253
But you guys have to get some
scholarships

623
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,588
Dude I barely pulled a C average

624
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:03,593
I got a 2.3 and for the last 4 years
have done absolutely no community service

625
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:07,931
I've never helped out in any group
or organization in any fucking way

626
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:11,301
Do I look like an A student to you

627
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,136
I don't even know where the fuck
I slept last night

628
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,239
But I do know I have tons of scholarships
rolling in each and every semester

629
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,174
How's that

630
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,208
Rule number 7

631
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,376
Hit on high school chicks

632
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,911
Get one to ask you to prom

633
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,679
Dude were 22 years old

634
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,980
We're not going to prom

635
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,650
Ever heard the expression off
like a prom dress

636
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,552
I believe it speaks for itself

637
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,587
Well, anyway if you go to prom
in a tuxedo

638
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,155
And your date wears a dress
made of duct tape

639
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:36,092
You can basically win up to $2,500
in scholarship money for college

640
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,128
I'm the 3 year reigning scholarship winner

641
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,963
I don't believe this guy

642
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,964
No way

643
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,499
This is a load of crap

644
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,568
No seriously it's a real scholarship

645
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,137
Now I've already been invited
to prom this year

646
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:50,373
But just so you guys know I did invite
a couple of high school chicks today

647
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,542
Actually even a few hot ones at
the barbeque right now

648
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,343
No shit

649
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,644
No shit I'm the shit

650
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,146
Rule number 8

651
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,981
You don't have to be sober to cook

652
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,950
I am an excellent cook

653
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,084
You can't cook

654
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,286
Ever heard of Fossil's famous cherry pie

655
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,389
No, he does make a mean cherry pie
I'll give him that

656
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,425
The guy makes a hell of a cherry pie

657
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,593
You're damn right I do

658
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:13,530
You're looking at the 2005 2006
Mr. Cherry Pie Scholarship Award Winner

659
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,665
That's a cool grand each year for college

660
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,002
You can't cook

661
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,304
That's not even a real scholarship

662
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,573
You bet your ass it is

663
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,410
Basically I just bake a little weed
into the pie

664
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,546
Judges will vote for anything if their high

665
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,249
Fossil rule number 9

666
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,617
It's not a lie if you believe it

667
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,220
Basically just tell a lie so many times
that even you forget if it's the truth or not

668
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:43,023
For example I'm getting scholarships
for Cancer, Leukemia, Tuberculosis

669
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,329
I think I'm getting one for
being a single parent

670
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,498
But it's up to you guys to figure out
what your story is going to be

671
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,432
What the lie is going to be

672
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,301
So, if you guys don't mind

673
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,335
Go get some scholarships

674
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,004
It's time for me to take my meds

675
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:58,134
Did I mention I have glaucoma

676
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,971
So, what high school do you go to

677
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,474
Oh, I go to East and my
best friend Joy she goes to East

678
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:38,441
But now she goes to CC

679
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,576
And she promised to be
best friends forever

680
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,577
But I'm not sure anymore

681
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,711
Because she's friends
with this girl named Paula

682
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,912
And Paula's a total bitch

683
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,514
And I really wanted to go to the
mall one day and she wouldn't let me go

684
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,515
So, so your high school

685
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,049
Does it have a prom
Oh yeah

686
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,352
Wait, whoa

687
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,154
Are you asking me to go to prom

688
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,355
Yeah

689
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,023
Oh my God, Oh my God

690
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,960
Joyce is going to be so jealous
I'm going to prom with a college guy

691
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,329
I have to tell her right now

692
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,432
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God

693
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,100
So, I was thinking
about what we could wear

694
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,469
There's this scholarship
Yeah, I got this pink dress with a white trim on it

695
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,071
And it's going to cost
about $300 of your money

696
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,606
Because it's from a really
expensive store I really like

697
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,640
But I haven't even been there in years
And I really want to go there

698
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,209
Actually I was thinking
we could both go in duct tape

699
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,279
But duct tape doesn't come in pink

700
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,116
Besides I have this black
tux for you with a pink cumber bun

701
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,050
And we're going to totally match

702
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,286
And your twin should
really go with my best friend

703
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,054
So we can go to this
really expensive restaurant

704
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,523
Because I totally don't want
to eat and not look fat in my dress

705
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,549
And I want to get their late so I
look like the shit when I get to the ball

706
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,662
Do you have any idea
what just happened to me

707
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,963
Did you get laid

708
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,032
No, my God no I didn't get laid

709
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:37,700
Did you at least get close

710
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,335
Yeah we got to first base

711
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,638
Rounded 2nd and thank God
we didn't get to 3rd

712
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,706
Hey, second base
That's not bad

713
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,575
No, it was, it was with a man you idiot

714
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,112
Yeah that is a possible
unfortunate side effect to that plan

715
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,580
Did that ever happen to you

716
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,714
Nope, never

717
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,451
Yeah, yeah I'll see you

718
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,353
Oh, and don't call Kerry alright

719
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,655
I don't want any more of your help

720
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,357
You got it
Alright, sure

721
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,927
You know I was kicked in the balls

722
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,695
The girl that I like hates me

723
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,164
And I was taken advantage of by a man

724
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,999
That's where your idiot help
has gotten me

725
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,968
I'll stay out of it

726
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,002
Fine

727
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,596
Have a nice day

00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,183

Don't just stand there
Get a mop

Have some pride in your fraternity house

750
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,371
We got to go see Fossil

751
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,974
Fossil, do you notice that
none of Fossil's plans ever work

752
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,076
Or even come close to working

753
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:28,244
I don't know what to do Jake

754
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,512
Yeah, well neither do I
I'm desperate

755
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:33,583
This is Jake
This is Evan

756
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,486
This is there last day of college here

757
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,354
Dan what the hell are you doing

758
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:39,289
Oh sorry

759
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,691
This is Ushmad and Ashot

760
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,494
They are foreign exchange
students from India

761
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,696
It is O.K. if we are to say hello to you

762
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,265
Oh, we are working on fraternity story

763
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,302
Ushmad and Ashot are journalism majors

764
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,272
And they are working on a fraternity
story about life here next year

765
00:42:56,273 --> 00:43:00,766
And I figured I would give them a head start
and show them around a bit Is that alright

766
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,248
Today is your last day of college yes

767
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,583
Looks that way

768
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,453
Oh, you are very very fortunate

769
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:15,558
My brother and I must spend 3 more
years prior to receiving diplomas

770
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,193
You can have mine

771
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,461
I am sorry

772
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,431
So you guys stay here during
the summers too

773
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,267
Yes, it is very much a homesick time

774
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,236
We will not return to home for 3 whole years

775
00:43:27,242 --> 00:43:29,038
And your parents
They don't ever visit

776
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,608
No, it is too far away

777
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,643
And they are very busy

778
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:38,414
So, these checks

779
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,017

They were nice
Very good

793
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,956
But Americans we have such
misconception

794
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:23,359
Our country it is not the same
No. It is not

795
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,697

I'm really sorry about everything

00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:51,180
Um, I'm normally not that kind of guy

807
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:56,185
Well, you seem alright now
that we've got to talk for a while

808
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:59,422
And I'm so sorry I beat you up

809
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,458
That Fossil

810
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,960
Talk about an A one asshole

811
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,027
Fossil

812
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,397
No, Fossil's a little strange

813
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,433
But overall a good guy

814
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,635
He was there when I needed help and

815
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,603
You're going to want to hear this

816
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,577
Hey Kerry this is Greg

817
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,414
Just calling to invite you to our pursuit of worldly
knowledge with handcuffs party tonight

818
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,018
Anyway, I don't blame you for
kicking Scooter in the nuts this afternoon

819
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,520
The guy is a little woos

820
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,321
I wouldn't like him if I were a girl either

821
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,157
Forget about that looser

822
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,091
Come over tonight

823
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,560
Handcuff yourself to me and
we'll have a great time alright

824
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,594
See you tonight

825
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,494
That son of a bitch

826
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,268
Do you want to get back at him

827
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,703
I think I have an idea

828
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,375
Alright we need to find their student I.D.'s

829
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,944
Bring them back to Fossil and
he can put our pictures right on them

830
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,445
I wonder if they have Indian porn

831
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,072
Get out of here Ushmad

832
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,551
Indian porn, Indian porn

833
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,586
What the hell is this

834
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,555
Dude I found the checks

835
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,157
What the hell is this

836
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,525
Dear Ushmad and Ashot

837
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,294
Fuck

838
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,461
What

839
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,930
Their grandma died
So?

840
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,999
So, they have to go home for a year

841
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,501
We can't use them to go to college

842
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,636
Why did she have to die

843
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,867
No, no

844
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,577
Every single rule Fossil had entrusted in us

845
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,047
Turned out to be a complete
God damn disaster

846
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:34,183
Somehow we always ended up
worse than when we started

847
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,551
It's all over

848
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,521
It's 5 o'clock and our parents
are coming in 13 hours

849
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,157
And we have absolutely no options left

850
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,026
Today was really going to be
our last day of college

851
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:49,097
Well, might as well smoke a bowl
and get laid

852
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,568
So Kegger, Brandon told me that
you fucked a pledge today dude

853
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,637
No, you fucked the pledge

854
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,272
Oh yeah me, no

855
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,141
He had his legs all straddled up
around you

856
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,410
Don't listen to this shit
Don't listen to that shit

857
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,547

You know what you're like

862
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:26,302
So, I'll see you your fucking socks

00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,675
Where the fuck are my
Oh shit

887
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,292
They are so gay

888
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,161
Girls what are we going to do now

889
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,330
You're the only one not naked

890
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,562
C'mon lets go
Ah yeah

891
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,472
Mom, Dad

892
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,407
You look messy

893
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,443
How are my soon to be graduate boys

894
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,479
Well mom

895
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,346
Great to see you son

896
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,481
Great to see you sir

897
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,984
Son, are you O.K.

898
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,085
Ah, he's fine sir

899
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,087
Mom, how are you

900
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,222
Good Jake

901
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,490
It's so good to see you

902
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,292
Let's go inside so I can start
packing your clothes

903
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,662
Well, I thought that you
and Dad would be here at 6 A.M.

904
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,364
Like we talked about
on the phone Right Dad

905
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:39,468
I thought I'd allow your mother a head start on
packing your clothes, moving stuff out of the room

906
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,170
Wow, what a great surprise

907
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,238
We can't

908
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,439
Well why not

909
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,407
Because

910
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:49,512
Because we have a meeting
across campus in 20 minutes

911
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,615
With a History Professor

912
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,084
Really, which professor

913
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:59,055
Ah, History Professor Hughes

914
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,322
Professor Hughes

915
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,691
H-U-G-H-E-S

916
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,193
Yeah, that's right
Do you know him

917
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,262
Sounds familiar

918
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,231
But I've never met a
History Professor Hughes before

919
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:13,269
You weren't going to see the
professor looking like that were you

920
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,139
No, no I thought we had left our
nice clothes out here on the porch

921
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,041
Well, looks like we didn't

922
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,010
We're just going to go inside
and throw something on

923
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,311
I got a great idea

924
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,481
Why don't you and Mom come over
the History House in 20 minutes

925
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,583
You can sit in on the meeting with us

926
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,553
Dude, we don't have no meeting

927
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,612
Ah, ouch, stop

928
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,225
We're just going to throw on some clothes

929
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,460
We'll be back in 20 minutes sir

930
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,429
Son, we'll just come inside
with you and wait until you change

931
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,298
And then all of us will
go over there together

932
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:46,235
Well, Dad I thought that Mom
might want to see the Flower Grove

933
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,737
They are in full blossom this time of year

934
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,005
They are absolutely beautiful

935
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:53,642
Our college ranked number 1 best
flowers in the country

936
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,444
It's going to be dark in 20 minutes

937
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,313
Wouldn't you like to see them Mom

938
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,981
Ah Jake

939
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,317
It's so nice of you to think of me

940
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,618
C'mon, let's go

941
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:07,690
Alright then we'll see in the front entrance
of the History House in 20 minutes. Sharp

942
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:08,953
Yes sir

943
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:12,328
Fossil, I'm in way too deep

944
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,998
I told my parents that we have a meeting with
Professor Hughes over at the History Office

945
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,334
It's all a lie
How could they have showed up early

946
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,436
Life as a college student
is finished, done, over

947
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,638
Is Evan stoned

948
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,940
You know I always knew I'd
have to deal with this moment

949
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,344
But I feel like I'm at a funeral
only it's my funeral

950
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,613
It's O.K. Jake
It's alright

951
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:34,216
What are you consoling me
for your life is over to you moron

952
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:38,554
Ah, it seems that your parents have
shown up a little earlier than expected

953
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,722
What, my parents are here

954
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,956
Yeah, snap out of it

955
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,592
I had to cover for you because Mom
and Dad wanted to come into the house

956
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,461
It smells like a God damn reggae party

957
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,562
You screwed up dude

958
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,297
I screwed up
What did you do?
What did I do?

959
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,632
The only thing I did is save your ass

960
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,633
Save my ass

961
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,500
Yeah, save your ass

962
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,605
No man, sounds like you
made things unnecessarily worse

963
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,542
You know what, you don't even know
what lie I even told Mom and Dad

964
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,645
And you were standing right there
you fucking moron - Enough!

965
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:07,216
The two of you are going home from
college and never coming back again ever

966
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,186
Now Jake, what did you tell your parents

967
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,489
I told them we had a meeting with
Professor Hughes at the History Office

968
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,051
Did you tell your parents what the
meeting was about. - No

969
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:20,296
Alright, what were your plans
once you got to the History House

970
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,597
I don't have any plans

971
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,634
I figured I'd just go over there and tell them
that the meeting got cancelled or something

972
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,605
Alright, well do either of your
parents know Professor Hughes

973
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,539
Or know what he looks like

974
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,341
No, there is no Professor Hughes
I made the name up

975
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,943
Put the God damn fish bowl down

976
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:38,480
And are there any pictures of Professor Humes
anywhere on the first floor of the History House

977
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,584
No, are you listening
There is no Professor Hughes

978
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:43,052
There is now

979
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,687
Rule number 10

980
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,722
When all else fails impersonate a professor

981
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,290
Forcibly if needed

982
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,527
Gentlemen, I am Professor Humes

983
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,697
No, it's Hughes H-U Hughes

984
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:55,698
Yeah, yeah, yeah whatever

985
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,634
Alright Jake, Evan, I need you two
to head over to the History Office

986
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,569
Hold them off for just a little bit

987
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,071
I'm going to throw on a suit

988
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,539
I'll get over there as quick as I can

989
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,573
I'm going to help you out of this

990
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,609
Get the fuck off me

991
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,601
Get the fuck off me
Let's go

992
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,700
Gotcha
What?

993
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,372
Kerry what are you doing

994
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,606
You're getting what you asked for

995
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,941
You wanted to hang out with me tonight

996
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,009
And now you got me

997
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,577
Yeah tonight, later, um

998
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,113
Can you please unlock me

999
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,014
I don't have the key

1000
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,181
It's in my dorm room

1001
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,483
Where we should end up tonight

1002
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,118
Ah, fuck, alright

1003
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,486
Just, just come with me

1004
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,615
Where are we going

1005
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,326
You must be Mr. Tanner

1006
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,595
It's a pleasure to meet you sir
Hi

1007
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,898
I am obviously Professor Hughes

1008
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,367
What the hell is going on here
Oh, how rude of me

1009
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,336
Mr. and Mrs. Tanner this is Kerry

1010
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:10,071
Kerry, this is Mr. and Mrs. Tanner

1011
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,408
Nice to meet you dear

1012
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,310
I love the shirt

1013
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,946
You're probably wondering why
Kerry and I are handcuffed together

1014
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:21,550
Well, um, we are handcuffed this

1015
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,085
This is for charity

1016
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,953
Charity

1017
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,589
He's lying
I'm a whore

1018
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,459
Um, theatre students

1019
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,061
Great imagination

1020
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:35,197
Well, what Kerry is trying to get at is

1021
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:40,432
The school has decided to handcuff a professor
with a student to raise money for cancer

1022
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,604
That's nice

1023
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:47,710
Who in the world thought of the idea to
handcuff a female student with a male teacher

1024
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,312
Well, we believe in outside the box
thinking here

1025
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,116
Well as you both already know

1026
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,452
Both Jake and Evan are special students

1027
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,120
They're actually 2 of
the tops in my class

1028
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,155
Must be a pathetic class

1029
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:05,509
Pathetically challenging historical wise

1030
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:11,066
Well, today I would like to offer both Jake and
Evan my coveted teaching assistant positions

1031
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,334
Absolutely

1032
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,270
Yeah, absolutely, yeah

1033
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,739
Don't worry about it guys you earned it

1034
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,276
I'm actually pretty excited that
you decided to accept the postions

1035
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,046
Does anybody else need a drink

1036
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,382
Now is not the time to drink

1037
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,916
Just take a drink Greg

1038
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,218
I don't want a drink

1039
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,286
If you don't take a drink
I'll scream and scream and scream

1040
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,559
Fine, I will take a drink

1041
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,361
Here

1042
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:41,096
I don't want any

1043
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm not so sure that this is
the best thing for Jake and Evan to do

1044
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,203
They were planning at working at a bank

1045
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,973
Trust me Mom, Dad

1046
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:54,977
There is nothing more Jake and I
want more than to be here next year

1047
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,513
Well, I suppose

1048
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,082
As long as it's what you want to do

1049
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,152
I guess it sounds like a good opportunity

1050
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,487
What are you going to do for money

1051
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,555
Where are you going to stay

1052
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,556
When do you start

1053
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:12,961
Mr. Tanner, your sons will be begin preparing
my next year's curriculum as soon as this Monday

1054
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,263
They'll be here all summer

1055
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,497
All through next year

1056
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,599
And as far as some of your other concerns

1057
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,499
They

1058
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:24,273
As far as some of your other concerns
they can live on campus housing for free

1059
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,574
Otherwise they can, Huh

1060
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:31,004
They, there is going to be a
small fee of $1,500 per student

1061
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:33,282
Just basically to lock in
the positions for next year

1062
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,284
That will need to be taken care of today

1063
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,320
Alright then

1064
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:41,254
Who do I make the check out to

1065
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:44,426
That's Greg Karanowski

1066
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,195
K-A-R-A-N

1067
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,163
I thought your last name was Hughes

1068
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,165
Hughes is just a nickname

1069
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,235
Ah, I'm so proud of you boys

1070
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,270
Thank you Mom
Thanks a lot sir

1071
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,340
Well, looks like you both
have busy schedules ahead of you

1072
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:02,004
I guess Mom and I will head back
to the hotel and head back tomorrow

1073
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,615
Thanks a lot Professor Hughes

1074
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,949
And if you don't mind

1075
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,053
Actually Kerry and I also need to leave

1076
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,121
We're going to have sex

1077
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,681
Oh, but it's for charity

1078
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,360
I'll tell you

1079
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,966
These professors could
never survive in the real world

1080
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,535
Yes dude I can't believe that shit worked

1081
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,636
Fossil you did it man

1082
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,071
No problem boys

1083
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,038
Do you guys mind

1084
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,641
Oh, yeah, yeah we're leaving

1085
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,910
Hey can we just grab that $3000 first

1086
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,612
I'm sorry, what

1087
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:40,516
That $3,000 that you got from our Dad
to pay for our room and board next year

1088
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,617
For you

1089
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,218
That's my 3 G's boys

1090
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,621
Cha Ching
I'm coming back for year 9 bitches

1091
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,522
Wait a second

1092
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,623
You're stealing money from our Dad

1093
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:52,394
You know now is really not a good time
to talk about this

1094
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,063
You know I'm about ready to bring out the
ole Fossil bone if ya know what I'm saying

1095
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:57,199
I know what you're saying

1096
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,962
Take another drink first

1097
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,903
Don't let the door hit
your ass on the way out boys

1098
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,947
It's 10 P.M.

1099
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,048
Time for hell night

1100
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,584
Tonight we welcome back
all of our past pledge masters

1101
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,921
They'll help us activate our pledges

1102
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,423
And bring them into the
brotherhood of Iota Gamma Chi

1103
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:26,328
I think the old farts really
enjoy taking a break from their lives

1104
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,956
To spend one more weekend in the
fraternity

1105
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:34,000
I, I, I, Iota Gamma Chi

1106
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,171
I, I, I, Iota
Stop

1107
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,372
That's horrible

1108
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,341
Pathetic

1109
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,977
Let me show you guys
why you're pledging

1110
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:47,811
1965 the year my father
pledged this fraternity

00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,053

1118
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,838

You got that

1120
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:17,379
Now boys you have the pleasure of meeting
one of the founding fathers of this fraternity

1121
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,215
Sir, do you have anything to say sir

1122
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:24,652
I fucked every one of the Golden Girls

1123
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:26,688

1124
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,590

You guys are going to pay

1128
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,860
The General is here

1129
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,736
That's The General

1130
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,138

1132
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:47,504
Let's go. Let's do this

1133
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,645
Say it, say it

You worthless scum have embarrassed me

1136
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:39,421
The alumni are here

1137
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:43,922
And they are asking me why have I turned
you into such worthless pieces of shit

1138
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,161
Why have I not turned you into Gammas

1139
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,629
It's all my fault

1140
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,164
No

1141
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:50,432
Who will step up

1142
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:54,035
Who will fill these shoes and turn you
into Gammas and turn you into real men

1143
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,237
Who will

1144
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,072

01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,047
Sir yes sir

1150
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,115

It's over, I'm a Gamma Chi now

1162
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,955
So what's up ladies

1163
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:49,447
Who would like to
try a brand new Gamma Chi

1164
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,958
Alright Fossil some hundred proof vodka
and a laxative ought to loosen you up

1165
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:02,001

Kegger, come here man

1174
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,235
You were the biggest dick

1175
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,437
No, you made it
You were my favorite pledge

1176
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,005

Shot for shot

1183
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,149
I'm taking you on all night grandpa

1184
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,518
Kegger this is not a hot dog eating contest

1185
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,953
This is alcohol

1186
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,488
You went down this morning

1187
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,556
You're going down again tonight

1188
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,359
I, I, I, Iota Gamma Chi

1189
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,731
I, I, I, Iota Gamma Chi

1190
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:43,438
You want to dance

1191
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,372
What

1192
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,008
I want to get in your pants

1193
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,670
Oh, yeah, O.K.

1194
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,897
I love this boys

1195
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,544
We're in this really deep bro'

1196
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,446
I know

1197
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:27,582
Do you miss this much

1198
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,150
What's that

1199
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,153
This place, college, the fraternity

1200
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:37,121
No, I mean don't get me wrong
I had a great time when I was here

1201
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:40,195
But, I'm pretty happy with my life

1202
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,564
What about the girls

1203
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:47,700
Ah yeah sure, I mean, sleeping
with a different co-ed every weekend

1204
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:48,636
It has got its appeal

1205
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,239
But I have a beautiful wife

1206
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,074
Couple of great kids

1207
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:57,212
So, overall, no I don't miss it

1208
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:00,315
You guys are graduating tomorrow right

1209
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:03,018
Yeah, well, no

1210
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,919
I mean we were supposed but

1211
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,921
I think we figured out a way to stay

1212
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,257
Stay and do what

1213
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:13,023
Stay, live in the frat and party

1214
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,164
I'm putting you into retirement grandpa

1215
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,967
If you want to quit just ask for mercy

1216
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,369
Oh, no c'mon Greg you can do it, drink

1217
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,144
You know Greg, Fossil,
or whatever you call him

1218
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,979
You think he's the king of campus

1219
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,382
I bet if you'd ask most of the students
here they would think that he is a joke

1220
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,018
He's a joke to the alumni

1221
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,554
You know I pledged with him

1222
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,057
He's cool to your face

1223
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,160
But you turnaround and
he'll stab you in the back

1224
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,163
Your right

1225
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:50,565
He screwed over Scooter today

1226
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,601
He took $3,000 from our Dad

1227
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,937
I really feel sorry for the guy

1228
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,372
He's stuck

1229
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:01,242
He has no idea which direction
to take his life

1230
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:05,547
And every year that goes by he
just becomes more and more pathetic

1231
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,606
And he knows it

1232
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,117
Oh my God

1233
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,420
Wait Kegger, you were
just drinking water like me right

1234
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:16,391
No, hundred proof vodka all night

1235
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,486
I had to beat him fair and square

1236
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,333
You guys want to know
what the secret to life is

1237
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,858
What's that

1238
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,572
Make a career out of something you love

1239
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,408
Something you have passion for man

1240
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,643
So what do you do

1241
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,946
Me, I love sports

1242
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,582
I majored in sports
management when I was here

1243
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,118
And then it was off to major league soccer

1244
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:47,155
6 months ago I bought an interest
in the Chicago Fire soccer team

1245
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,190
You serious
The Fire's our favorite team

1246
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,492
Evan and I play soccer

1247
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:54,019
We've been team captains for
the past 3 years, all conference

1248
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,165
I'll tell you what

1249
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,566
If you guys are interested

1250
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,935
Why don't you guys come by the stadium

1251
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,237
Work out with the team

1252
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,340
Give me a call tomorrow and
I'll put you in touch with some coaches

1253
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,143
Dude, we'll definitely call you

1254
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,245
Hey man, I'm still a Gamma

1255
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,380
And I'll do anything to help out a brother

1256
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:16,184
Well I got to get back to the wife

1257
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,218
You guys take it easy

1258
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,586
Thanks for letting me stop by

1259
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,883
Anytime

1260
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,223
Oh God

1261
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:25,955
Here, I got the key

1262
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,954
You all right
Thank you

1263
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,124
We did it

1264
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,677
Let's get out of here

1265
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,381
Here's your hot dog eating contest bitch

1266
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,429
Ladies, you want to get us some beers

1267
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:06,367
Yeah buddy, those chicks are hot

1268
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,671
What's up Winston, Brandon

1269
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,505
What's up brothers
How are you doing

1270
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:14,242
Hey dude it turns out that
you're not that smart at history

1271
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,311
Actually man I'm plenty smart

1272
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:20,215
I failed that test on
purpose and so did Brandon here man

1273
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,716
What the hell are you talking about

1274
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,484
We don't want to graduate

1275
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,421
Everyone knows that if
you fail your last final

1276
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,190
That your parents will pay to
send you back for another semester

1277
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:33,328
Bro' my parents paid for 4 full years of tuition

1278
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,163
Do you really think that
they are going to let me come

1279
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:38,766
3 credits shy of graduation and call it quits

1280
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,002
Not a chance man

1281
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,638
Dude I can't believe these
2 fuckers didn't know that

1282
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,540
Bro' we're coming back for another year

1283
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:46,574
5th year baby

1284
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,742
5th year

1285
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,577
See you boys later

1286
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:53,070
Shmucks

1287
01:10:58,287 --> 01:10:59,654
Ah, he shit himself

1288
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,679
What a loser

1289
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:12,200
Hello, who the hell is this
in the middle of the black night

1290
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,702
Yes sir it's me, and Evan's here to

1291
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,071
Harold, Harold who is it

1292
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:18,573
Nobody, go back to sleep

1293
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,643
Jake, I've been thinking

1294
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:25,680
I'm going to look into that crackpot professor's
credentials first thing in the morning

1295
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,949
Actually Dad, don't even worry about it

1296
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:31,085
Evan and I don't want to
become teacher's assistants anyway

1297
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:35,189
Good, now let me get off the damn
telephone and let me go back to bed

1298
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,658
Harold, language

1299
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,061
Sir, we have a tryout with a
major league soccer team next week

1300
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,296
Soccer

1301
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,166
Now listen that's enough games
at 3:00 in the morning

1302
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:48,002
I'm picking you and your
idiot brother up at 6 A.M.

1303
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,237
And that's the end of it

1304
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,973
No sir, we're going our
own way and that's the end of it

1305
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,441
So make sure that you cancel that check

1306
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,009
You're going your own way

1307
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,045
Yes sir

1308
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:01,215
You know this is the
first time you ever stood up to me

1309
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,484
Finally grew up a little bit huh

1310
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,955
Well I guess the banking
business isn't going anywhere

1311
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,391
You give your mother a call
tomorrow afternoon

1312
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,259
We will

1313
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,193
And Jake

1314
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,594
Sir

1315
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:16,998
You give me a call after
those soccer tryouts

1316
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,667
If you put your mind to it you can do it

1317
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,829
You and Evan both

1318
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,109
He actually took it alright

1319
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,211
Hey what time is it

1320
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,379
It's about 3 A.M.

1321
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,047
You think there's any chicks downstairs

1322
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,449
A couple drunk ones

1323
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:35,316
Works for me

1324
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,579
Me too

1325
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,586
Idiot kids

1326
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,468
You can have me if you want me

1327
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:56,704
I'm a little nervous

1328
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,196
It will come naturally

1329
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:23,456
I'm a man

1330
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,800
Subtitles: Arigon

1331
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,380
Hey

1332
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,717
Evan, what's up man

1333
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,419
I was thinking man

1334
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:49,290
We should have one more
game while we're still in college

1335
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:53,161
Alright

1336
01:13:53,162 --> 01:13:55,596
Let's go

1337
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:00,568
So that's it

1338
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,702
That's our story

1339
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,639
I'd like to tell you that we went on

1340
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,141
Played major league soccer in Chicago

1341
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,609
Maybe we'll make the team

1342
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,977
Maybe we won't

1343
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:12,413
I don't know what's going to happen next

1344
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,016
But I'll tell you this much

1345
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:16,184
Whatever happens

1346
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,352
We'll never end up like Fossil

1347
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,980
With a dick in our mouths

1348
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,140
Hey, good luck with those soccer tryouts

1349
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,575
I know you'll do a good job

1350
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,907
I hope so, I'm really excited

1351
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,172
Ah, good God

1352
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,020
Hey, by the way

1353
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,289
Your grandma's dead

1354
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:56,848
No
