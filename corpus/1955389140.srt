Ladies and gentlemen, your
hosts, Jonah Ray and Kumail
Nanjiani!

9
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,113
Yay!

10
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,582
This is for you guys.

11
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,051
Grabbing your boobs.
Grabbing your boobs.

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,452
Is that the wrong direction?

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,021
There's only One Direction.

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:57,024
How many One Direction
fans are here?

15
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,026
And just be honest,
this is a safe place.

16
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,461
Oh, you're an idiot.

17
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,796
I'm joking.
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,064
Are you a One Direction fan?

19
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,699
You are. No, it's okay.

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,767
So, how old are you?

21
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:07,835
20.
20.

22
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:11,338
That's slightly too old.
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,840
What's your name?
Frankie.

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,075
Frankie...
that's a great name.

25
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,678
Um, it's too weird,
it's like--
20, 20, Kumail, 20.

26
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,080
D'uh-- I'm--

27
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,550
KUMAIL (O.S.):
Um, what's their big song?

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,185
Oh, You Don't Know
You're Beautiful?

29
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,653
That's Why You're Beautiful.

30
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,956
Do you know you're beautiful?

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,990
You don't know?

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,427
20. 20.

33
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:37,531
Yeah, bro, could you just
give me like 30 seconds?

34
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,433
Do you know you're beautiful?

35
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,137
That's what makes you beautiful?
You're like-- you've like bought
into this.

36
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,639
JONAH (O.S.):
Yeah.

37
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,342
Well, you're beautiful, Frankie.
20!

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,245
Are you--

39
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,714
Did any--

40
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,450
Th-- who likes the Shins?

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,057
I just want her to know
she's beautiful.
Oh, god.

42
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,059
Tell her in your van, Kumail.

43
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,329
Have you ever had vodka?

44
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,931
Eeew!

45
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,268
It's really good.
It makes you feel beautiful.

46
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:18,172
This is-- this show
has two speeds.

47
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,841
Racism and statutory.

48
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,410
And baby, this ain't racism.

49
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:31,251
Steven Agee, you're so great!.

50
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,789
KUMAIL (O.S.):
Are you guys ready
for more show?

51
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,525
JONAH (O.S.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
Steve Agee!

52
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,630
Wow, that was awesome.
This is a very exciting night.

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,098
It's actually been a great day.

54
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,170
I found out earlier, I can in
fact, fuck my way out of a paper
bag.

55
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:57,010
Take that, Linda, my estranged
wife. It wasn't that difficult.

56
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,080
It's even easier if it's wet.

57
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,720
I, uh, when I was in college,
me and my best friend Sam,
were sitting there...

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,256
high, and I mean like
college high.

59
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,859
We were sitting around
in my apartment,
and we were desperately...

60
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,096
45 minutes, trying to remember
the name of the actress...

61
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,067
who played the receptionist
in Ghostbusters.

62
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,237
45 minutes, it's two of us
just sitting there going...

63
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,573
Agh! Don't talk, it's on the
tip of my tongue, dude!

64
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:31,178
After 45 minutes, out of nowhere
my friend just gives up
and goes...

65
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,847
"Screw it, I'm gonna make soup."

66
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,618
That was weird, because no one
ever cooked in my apartment.

67
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,755
So he gets up and he goes into
the kitchen, and I hear him
digging around...

68
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,157
and all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, he goes...

69
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,727
"Hey, man, do you
have any pots?"

70
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,233
I go, "Yeah, dude, nice one,
nice save, you got it."

71
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,636
And he's like-- he doesn't
realize it, he's like, "What?"

72
00:03:55,736 --> 00:04:00,040
I go, "Annie Potts, the actress,
her name was Annie Potts."

73
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:05,746
He realized what happened,
and he comes out of the kitchen
trembling.

74
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,282
Like convulsing.

75
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:11,051
He's like, "Dude, what just
happened?"

76
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,753
And then, I realize it,
and I start shaking.

77
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,155
I'm like, "Dude, I don't know.
That's crazy, right?"

78
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,526
Try telling me there's
no God after hearing that.

79
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,964
I picture him up in heaven
watching us, going, "You idiots!
It's Annie Potts!

80
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:28,368
"People are starving and they
need my help, but I'm invested
in this now.

81
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,373
"Uh, okay, think, oh, okay, um--

82
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,944
"All right, I'll make
the little one crave soup...

83
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,113
"and then I'll hide
the fat guy's pots.

84
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,482
"And then I'm gonna invent
the internet...

85
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,252
"because I don't have time
for this incidental bullshit."

86
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,347
is first crushes.

87
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:52,882
Do you want to know mine?

88
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:54,083
Yeah, what's yours, baby?
All right.

89
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:59,021
First off, I want to state
that I am married, to a woman.

90
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:02,158
But my first huge crush
was Robin Hood.

91
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,426
The cartoon!

92
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:06,762
The cartoon Robin Hood fox,
that was like my first crush...

93
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:09,365
where I was watching the Disney
version of Robin Hood.

94
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,033
He's a fox.
He's a fox.

95
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,134
In more ways than one.

96
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,271
He, like, it's like I saw it
and I was just like...

97
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,106
"Oh, he's so charming
and he is so--"

98
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:19,041
And then, like, I started
becoming a big fan
of George Clooney...

99
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:20,810
and I never knew why
I was so into him right away.

100
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,347
And then when
Fantastic Mr. Fox came out...

101
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,683
I saw him in fox form
and I was like, "Oh!"

102
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:30,453
Because he's thinking,
if Robin Hood the fox
was a human...

103
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,521
Yes!
That's George Clooney's
entire life.

104
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,790
That's his life, he's just
a charming, kind of whatever...

105
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,159
wants to do, gives things
to the poor, it's great.

106
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,764
My first crush wa-- okay,
did you guys ever see, uh...

107
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:44,166
Sleeping Beauty?
That cartoon?

108
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,569
Oh, wait, that's like,
kinda rape-y.

109
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,571
Okay, but that's not my crush.

110
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,442
My crush was the bad lady from,
you remember, Maleficent?

111
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,178
Yeah, oh my god, so hot.

112
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:57,513
The one that turns
into a dragon?

113
00:05:57,613 --> 00:05:59,615
Yeah! What's hotter than that?

114
00:05:59,715 --> 00:06:04,754
You just like have sex with her
and then you get a dragon ride!

115
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:08,891
She's got two horns, I know
where one of them is going,
right?

116
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,760
I don't know where
one of them is going.

117
00:06:10,893 --> 00:06:14,497
And then, I found out that
there's gonna be a movie...

118
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:18,100
coming out called Maleficent,
starring Angelina Jolie!

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,803
So, it's like I went back
through time and space...

120
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:25,908
and met a 12-year-old me and we
just high-fived our boners.

121
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,477
We just rubbed
our boners together.

122
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:33,482
And it's not pedophilia,
at worst, it's statutory
masturbation.

123
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,922
I feel like I could seduce
a younger version of me.

124
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:43,326
Let me guess, you like
Donatello? Here's a Twix.

125
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:47,229
Twix, that makes a lot of sense.
Two little brown sticks
next to each other.

126
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,502
And your husband's out there
talking about his first crush.

127
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:56,472
So I don't want to create
acrimony here...

128
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,108
I'm very comfortable.
Because they work
very closely together.

129
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,576
I'm very comfortable.
But he's talking about stuff.

130
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:02,144
He cheats on me constantly.

131
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:04,613
Wow, but only
with cartoon characters.

132
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:07,950
I have a wife and five kids
and sometimes I get sent
to the store.

133
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,554
If I get sent to the store,
it's for one item and usually
a convenience store.

134
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,155
In this case,
it was a carton of milk.

135
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,525
Outside the convenience store,
I noticed a man standing
over to the left.

136
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:21,464
He has one leg... but he also
has a t-shirt on that says,
"Leg story, $10."

137
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:28,504
What do I know? I have two
pieces of information.

138
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:32,908
There's a man with one leg,
and a story to tell.

139
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,909
Who am I to judge?

140
00:07:33,943 --> 00:07:36,912
This guy could inspire me...
with his story.

141
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,349
Hand him a ten dollar bill, say,
"All right, sir, I'd like
to hear your story.

142
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,051
"What is it, are you a vet?"

143
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,353
He said, "No, sir,
here's my story.

144
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:49,358
"The wife and I went to a
second-hand thrift store.

145
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,694
"We came upon a recliner.

146
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,129
"I said 'We're buying it.'

147
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,999
"My wife said it smells like
mold. I said, 'Shut yours,
woman.'

148
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,469
"We loaded it
into the pick-up truck.

149
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:04,874
"As we got home, I put the
recliner in front of the
television and I sat down.

150
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:08,310
"And then I exclaimed, 'Argh!'

151
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,480
"A spring had sprung loose
from the back of the recliner...

152
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,416
"and impaled the back of my leg.

153
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:17,286
"I didn't let on to the wife.

154
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:20,222
"A little later that evening,
she exclaimed it was time
for dinner.

155
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:24,226
"I said, 'I'll be eating
in the new recliner.'

156
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:27,930
"I realized I could not
extricate myself from said
spring at that point.

157
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,900
"Even later that night,
she said she's going to bed.

158
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:34,537
"I said, 'I'll be sleeping
in the new recliner,'...

159
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:37,773
"which was a mistake,
because as I slept...

160
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:42,611
"that spring dug deeper
slinky-like into the back
of my leg.

161
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:46,282
"In the morning, my wife awoke
and announced she'd be staying
at her sister's...

162
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:49,618
for a couple days. 'Good for
you,' I said, 'bad for me.'

163
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:54,023
"As I realized soon thereafter,
that spring must have had
some rust on it.

164
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:58,627
"Because I got tetanus,
which causes lockjaw.

165
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:02,498
"She returned two days later,
and as you can imagine
at this point...

166
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:06,302
"I could not speak and I had
defecated all over myself.

167
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:09,972
"She called the emergency
medical technicians.

168
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:14,243
"They removed me from the
recliner, took me to the
hospital and removed my leg.

169
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,379
"End of story."

170
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:25,755
Well, okay, less inspiring
than I'd hoped.

171
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:30,893
More of a cautionary tale...
about hubris and arrogance.

172
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,667
But thank you for your story.
I have some milk to procure.

173
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:42,571
He said, "Would you like to hear
how I lost my left nut for
another ten dollars?"

174
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,208
I said, "No, I think I'm good."

175
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:49,679
He said, "I'll show you
for five."

176
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,847
Let me tell you something,
folks.

177
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,417
That's the best five dollars
I ever spent.

178
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,687
Yeah.

179
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:06,089
What were your first crushes?
First crush.

180
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,290
Let's--
just raise your hand.

181
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,291
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:11,194
Ooh! Wait!
Christina Ricci in the
Addams Family.

183
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,830
Addams Family Values was when
she tears shit up at the camp.

184
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,000
And then you want to--
like, yeah, that stirred up
a lot of stuff for me.

185
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,305
And then, like, the boy she
likes is like this nebbishy
glasses kid... yeah.

186
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,008
Let's do a couple more.
A couple more.

187
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,445
Joey McIntyre
from New Kids on the Block.

188
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:33,517
You know what, it's hard when
women had crushes on people who
were so different from me.

189
00:10:33,617 --> 00:10:35,318
That's what's hard, like--
Oh, Jesus--

190
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,922
There was nobody here that had a
crush on anyone who was--

191
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,124
Aladdin?

192
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:58,208
I was wrong. That doesn't
feel good, either.

193
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:01,578
Well, tonight I'm doing
something where I'm
actually gonna do--

194
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:04,748
I'm setting three-- something
I've always wanted to do.

195
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:09,252
Three mics... one is gonna
be for regular bits.

196
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:14,758
One mic is gonna be for bits
that don't have very much--
just like orphans.

197
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:15,959
Just like one-liners.

198
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:18,962
In the middle is gonna
be for true emotional things.

199
00:11:19,062 --> 00:11:21,431
We're gonna start with orphans.

200
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:28,138
Must be nice to be old, because
you can wear like a Band-Aid
on your face for no reason.

201
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:34,077
And also you can make noises
and people just accept it.

202
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,412
Where you can just be like--

203
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,080
( CLEARS THROAT )

204
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,924
Um, I've had two girls break up
with me in the last year...

205
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:51,862
and I like, fuck, I cried really
hard.

206
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:55,499
And usually I cry, 'cause
when I break up with girls,
because I feel guilty.

207
00:11:55,599 --> 00:12:00,437
But this time I cried,
because I felt like, loss.

208
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:15,585
Look, these computers are too
powerful, am I right?

209
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,155
Just these phones and computers
are great, but they're
too powerful.

210
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,590
We're turn-- we're all like
Roman Emperors now...

211
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,893
just on our computers all day...

212
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,327
on Facebook and YouTube.

213
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,197
Don't like, that I like.

214
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:30,133
Incoming call... ignore.

215
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:36,239
We gotta figure this out,
because we have people giving
these, that are not qualified.

216
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,376
Because I was on YouTube,
Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

217
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,178
Dih-dih-dih-deh.
Dih-dih--

218
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,079
Like the most famous song
of all-time.

219
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:46,550
10,000 dislikes on YouTube.

220
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,752
I'm not kidding, that many
people were like...

221
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,557
"Your music stinks, bro, and
I know music, I'm from Tampa.
Thumbs down."

222
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:07,270
That ASPCA commercial,
with Sarah McLachlan?

223
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,573
And they had to-- they had to--
they finally stopped doing it.

224
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:13,043
Because they were-- they were
saving a lot of dogs...

225
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,812
but a lot of human beings
were taking their own lives.

226
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:26,056
Oh, um, so I have depression
and I take anti-depressants.

227
00:13:26,156 --> 00:13:29,459
And people-- like people go--

228
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,595
It's like it's stigmatized,
people were like, "You're weak."

229
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:36,399
And it's like, I'm not weak,
I just, like, I don't wake up
and go, "I'm weak."

230
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,402
I just go like,
"Oh, this is fair."

231
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,479
I got no hobbies.

232
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,782
I actually, I watch
documentaries, that's my
only hobby.

233
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,452
I watched this really good
Lance Armstrong documentary.

234
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,654
It's called The Armstrong Lie,
anybody see it?

235
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,156
All right, it's fantastic,
one guy.

236
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,091
Um, fantastic.

237
00:14:01,191 --> 00:14:03,193
Going to the movie,
I thought-- we all thought
about Lance Armstrong...

238
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,861
which was he's a piece
of garbage.

239
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,297
But now that I've seen the
movie, it's a little more
complicated than that...

240
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:10,033
because, all right, he won the
Tour de France seven times...

241
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,102
on drugs every time,
but here's the thing.

242
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:15,172
He also raised $100 million
for cancer research.

243
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,843
Say what you want about the guy,
but he figured out a way
to do drugs for charity.

244
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,546
That's something.

245
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:25,448
And it must have been hard to
resist, too, because if someone
came to me and was like...

246
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,252
"Neal, you can cure pediatric
AIDS, but you're gonna have
to do a ton of cocaine."

247
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,823
I'd be like, "Let's help
some kids, huh?"

248
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,613
Over right there.

249
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,883
Adam Scott, that's a new--
that's your first crush?

250
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:43,951
That's kind of new.

251
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,153
You waited a long time.
Yeah.

252
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,622
Late bloomer, that's not
a good--
That's-- I don't--

253
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:51,425
Uh...

254
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:00,301
Uh, I think someone
just said my name.

255
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,104
Wait, do you just show up when
your name's called.

256
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:06,006
Well, when it involves
a crush, I do.

257
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:07,308
Uh...
That's her.

258
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,377
Who? I'm sorry,
who is it, you?

259
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:12,346
Yeah.
Hi.

260
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,415
Uh, I'm Adam.
What's your name?

261
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,583
Danielle.

262
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,051
Danielle, hi.

263
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,287
I feel like we should
leave the room.
Yeah.

264
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:23,457
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want
to make this weird for anybody.

265
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:26,794
I just wanted to say hello,
and say thank you...

266
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:28,996
and, uh--

267
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,731
Do you want to like,
come up here and--

268
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,467
KUMAIL (O.S.):
What's gonna happen?
JONAH (O.S.): I-- I don't--

269
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,902
KUMAIL (O.S.): Oh, no.
ADAM (O.S.): Hi.

270
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,704
DANIELLE (O.S.):
Hi.

271
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,807
I'm Adam, sorry, I already said
that. I already said that.
You already introduced yourself.

272
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,976
Like, where are you from?

273
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,145
I live here in LA.

274
00:15:44,245 --> 00:15:46,714
LA, did you--
Oh, that's convenient.

275
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:50,818
Sorry, Kumail, do you-- do you
have something you need to say?

276
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,188
Can I...
I'm sorry, bro.

277
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,123
speak with Danielle?
No, no, I don't want to--

278
00:15:56,223 --> 00:16:00,961
Mow another guy's lawn,
I don't know.
Thank you.

279
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:03,964
It's not his lawn yet.

280
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,300
I-- I-- I hope
I'm not jumping the gun...

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,204
or any other, this is weird,
or whatever, but, um, like...

282
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,540
Will you marry me?

283
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,608
Uh, you're married.
Yeah, you're married.

284
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:15,743
You have a kid.

285
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,279
I am no longer married.

286
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:20,681
I more mean like--
Where do you
secretly want to go?

287
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,551
When I see a person that's
using-- like a Maria Bamford.

288
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,354
Well, that's so out of--
in the ether, it's hard to--

289
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:27,955
When I go, "Oh, man,
I wish I could do that."

290
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,958
It's like, well, I'm sure
everybody wishes they could
do everything...

291
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,094
that they're looking
and aren't doing.
Yeah, and yeah.

292
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:36,097
Yeah, I wish I could be
Rory Scovel and like
do a bong rip and kill...

293
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:39,400
harder than anyone in the world,
and do a different set
every night.

294
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,770
Well, I don't know
if Rory Scovel kills harder
than anyone in the world.

295
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,939
I do pretty well.

296
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:47,375
That's amazing,
I'm the best looking comic.

297
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:50,811
I think I'm the best looking
comic, not of all, but
tonight or whatever.

298
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,247
How do you think I look?
Do you think I look--

299
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,715
What do you think?
What do you think?

300
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:56,484
You like the look?
I feel like I look good.

301
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:59,754
MAN (O.S.):
Clown.

302
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,489
What?

303
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,758
MAN (O.S.):
You look like a clown.

304
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:06,394
All right.

305
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:10,798
No, I think you're pretty good,
but I just-- you look like
a French clown.

306
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:13,067
Doesn't he look like
a French clown? Look,
take off your glasses.

307
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,602
Take off those glasses.

308
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,437
Dude, I don't want to do--
I'm trying to do a TV set.

309
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,241
Look, you should be doing mime
or something, not comedy.

310
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:24,311
Take off the glasses.
Your glasses.

311
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:26,580
French clown, you look
like a French clown.

312
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:28,582
Doesn't he look--
French clown.

313
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,551
Do some mime for us.
Do some mime.

314
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,586
Please, do some mime.
I'm not-- I don't--

315
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:36,023
Imagine there's a banana
in front of you.
You're holding a banana.

316
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,959
All right, hol--

317
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,428
Hold up a banana in front
of you, in front of your
face, a banana.

318
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:42,396
Actually I don't-- I don't--
I don't know how to do--

319
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,964
I don't think
I want to do this.
Hold the banana in front of you.

320
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,399
No, I really, like,
don't want to do--

321
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:46,767
There's a banana
in front of you.
I don't want to-- no.

322
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,002
Okay, imagine there's
a penis in front of you.

323
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:51,939
Okay, yeah. Okay.

324
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,376
All right, like, okay, what are
you gonna do with this banana
penis situation?

325
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:58,979
All right, okay, you're
stroking the banana penis.

326
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,381
All right, I get it.
He's stroking the banana.

327
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:03,284
All right, you're peeling the
banana foreskin off the banana.

328
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,286
Okay, what are you gonna do--
okay, you've got a bana--

329
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:08,656
And he eats it, he ate it,
everybody. He ate the banana.

330
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,091
He ate the banana.

331
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:13,928
That's perfect, that's that
French clown magic right there.

332
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:15,262
Do another one.

333
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:19,467
Okay, he steps up to the plate,
he's-- okay, no--

334
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,936
He's gettin' the signal
from the-- the something.

335
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,371
Oh, he's pitching the ball.
He's pitching it.

336
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,438
All right, it's coming.

337
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,740
All right, he hits the ball,
it's a home run.

338
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,042
It's coming back, he catches
the ball, he eats it.

339
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:30,044
He ate it.
He ate the ball.

340
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:32,146
He ate the baseball.

341
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,316
This is the best. All right,
another one. Here we go.

342
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,318
Now you want to do it.
All right, good.

343
00:18:37,418 --> 00:18:39,153
All right, he's going fishing.
He's fishing.

344
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:41,122
He's sitting there,
he's waiting for that big one.

345
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,057
Oh, he's caught something.
You got that great white!

346
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,993
You gotta pull it in.
You got-- okay, pull it in.

347
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,062
Pull it in, all right,
those are reins.

348
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,731
They're reins to a horse.
He's pulling.

349
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,433
All right,
the horse is sinking.

350
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,502
Artax, Artax, you're sinking.

351
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,172
You have to fight the sadness!
Artax, please!

352
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:05,246
These hands--

353
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:09,650
They look like big,
strong hands, don't they?

354
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:17,058
Wait a second.
Better save some for later.

355
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,794
We've got a long way to go...

356
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,830
but it was the only way
we can get in touch
with an earthling child.

357
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,498
But what if he doesn't
know what he has to do?

358
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,368
What do I have to do?
He has to give me a new name.

359
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,970
He's already chosen it.
He just has to call it out.

360
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:32,073
It's not real,
it's only a story.

361
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:36,277
It's not real.
Bastian, say my name!

362
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:42,883
I can't! I can't! I have
to keep my feet on the ground!

363
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,886
Bastian, please! Save us!

364
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,457
Okay, I will!
I will do what I dream!

365
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:55,896
( YELLING GIBBERISH )

366
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,932
Moon Child.

367
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:04,739
And this...
is all that remains.

368
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:08,376
A Fantasia... and he eats it!

369
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:10,911
He ate it, everybody!
He ate it!

370
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:14,548
Thank you, everybody.

371
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:21,222
That was everything I hoped
it would be... and more.
That was amazing!

372
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:22,790
Thank you so much
for coming, guys!

373
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,625
Thank you so much
for coming to the Meltdown!
Get home safe!

374
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,127
Thanks for hanging out!

375
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,828
KUMAIL (O.S.):
Thanks for watching!

376
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:37,315
Yeah.
If the crowd,
like doesn't get it, then...

377
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,684
We did it in New York,
they start screaming at him.

378
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:42,086
Sit the fuck down!
Really?

379
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,389
This isn't that kind of place!
We don't heckle here!

380
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:44,489
