1
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:12,524
When you've finished, you come here.

2
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,363
- Lopez!
- <i>Here!</i>

3
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,443
Hello, Pepe.

4
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,683
Santiago!

5
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,123
I would like to go with you again.
We have some good catches.

6
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,640
You're with a lucky boat.

7
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,200
You stay with them.

8
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:14,486
But remember how you went many days
without a fish and then we caught big ones?

9
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,046
Every day for three weeks.

10
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,480
I remember.

11
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:21,196
I didn't think you left me...because you doubted.

12
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,123
It was Papa who made me leave.

13
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,686
He hasn't much faith.

14
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,723
But we have.

15
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,723
- Don't we?
- Yes.

16
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:34,883
Your luck will come back one day.

17
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,643
Mojito for the lady.

18
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,839
- And serving pi?a for the gentleman.
- Thank you.

19
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,763
They had a good catch.

20
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,803
For some, yes, the weather is good.

21
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,963
And your car, se?or?

22
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,756
We're waiting on a water pump.
The mechanic thinks it'll arrive in a day or two.

23
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:06,839
- You are comfortable upstairs?
- Very, thank you.

24
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,764
I don't care if we ever get a water pump.

25
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:12,407
Most er...Americans are impatient, no?

26
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,923
I have nothing but time.

27
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,760
That's good. Good.

28
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:21,404
Can I offer you a beer on the terrace?

29
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,159
Why not? Between fishermen.

30
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,159
Maybe I could be a fisherman.

31
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:47,246
You'd wait for me at the front door,
with loads of children scurrying under your feet.

32
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,840
Charming.

33
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,839
- I don't amuse you?
- Not today.

34
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,404
MAN: <i>Ah! Santiago!</i>
- Huh? Oh.

35
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:07,285
- No luck?
- No.

36
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:11,076
- How many days now, my friend?
- Too many.

37
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,805
- The man is a curse on the village.
- He was one of the best.

38
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:20,606
(Scoffs) His luck is like a black cloud.

39
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,717
And soon he's gonna poison all our bones.

40
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah.

41
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,238
Can I get you some sardines for tomorrow?

42
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:37,561
I have sardines.

43
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:39,205
I'd like to be of help in some way.

44
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:42,563
You bought me a beer. You're already a man.

45
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,083
The old man.

46
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,563
His grandfather, do you think?

47
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:52,603
I don't know.

48
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,643
You're the writer.

49
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,717
I know where I can get four fresh baits.

50
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:02,004
I have mine from today. I put them in the box.

51
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,362
Let me get you four fresh ones.

52
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,403
- One.
- Two.

53
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,443
All right, two.

54
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,483
You didn't steal them?

55
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:15,000
I would. But I bought these.

56
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,839
No, let him be.

57
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,718
I'm just gonna talk to him, OK?

58
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,763
(Chuckles)

59
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,643
- Excuse me, Santiago.
- Hm?

60
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,001
- How are you?
- Fine.

61
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:31,080
Um... Everyone knows
that you are the great expert of baseball.

62
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,123
- No.
- Yes.

63
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,358
And my friends and l,
we were discussing about DiMaggio.

64
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:38,802
And why his hits are so few these days.

65
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:43,438
And we thought that perhaps, being an expert,
you know, you might have an opinion.

66
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:45,358
Well, he's playing with an injury.

67
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:49,319
A spur. In his foot.

68
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,399
You see? I knew something was wrong.

69
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:55,843
And now I know why.
I know why he runs like an old woman.

70
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,360
You're mistaken.

71
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
Even with an injury, DiMaggio runs like a deer.

72
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:08,158
If you say so, but it is my opinion...
Now you can correct me if I'm wrong, Santiago,

73
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:12,323
but it is my opinion
that DiMaggio's good days are behind him.

74
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:15,479
That his reputation exceeds his performance.
Yes, yes.

75
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,559
But you see, that is not so unusual.

76
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:22,686
For they say that you were once
the greatest arm wrestler in all of Cuba.

77
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,723
From Havana to Matanzas.

78
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,280
They say many things.

79
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:31,645
They say that you once defeated the champion
in a contest that lasted two days.

80
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:34,685
But l, myself, I find that very hard to believe.

81
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:36,564
- Come along, Anderez.
- Yes, come.

82
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,603
Just...a minute.

83
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:41,724
<i>I'm talking to Santiago about arm wrestling</i>.

84
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:44,446
<i>He says he was a great champion once and</i>...

85
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:48,837
I would just like the honour
of engaging a great champion.

86
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,883
You're a fool, Anderez.

87
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:56,123
Well, old man?

88
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:59,445
Do you decline?

89
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:00,880
No.

90
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,042
Sit down.

91
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:16,963
The boy will be the judge.

92
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:20,005
Make sure the positions are... are fair.

93
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,441
- Are you ready, old man?
- Ready.

94
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,196
Wait a minute.

95
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:55,561
Wait, wait!

96
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,160
Wait a minute!

97
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,206
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye! Made a mistake.

98
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:06,203
Look at that arm.

99
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:09,203
That is not the arm of a champion.

100
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:12,441
That is just an old, withered tree branch.

101
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,644
<i>I'm afraid I would snap that arm</i>
<i>like a matchstick</i>.

102
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,683
Right! (Chuckles)

103
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,157
<i>You'll have to excuse me,</i>
<i>but I was misinformed</i>.

104
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,442
Lopez! Beer for everybody.

105
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:25,483
(Cheering)

106
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,203
Santiago.

107
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,121
Don't ruin us all with your bad luck, old man.

108
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,523
Don't.

109
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,163
You would have won.

110
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,606
Not today.

111
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:04,684
Tomorrow's gonna be a...good day.

112
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,683
Where are you going?

113
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,763
Far out.

114
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,645
Don't go too far. Your boat is small.

115
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,683
You'll be alone.

116
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,760
There's a fish out there...waiting for me.

117
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,920
Well, I'll... I'll get my father to work far out too.

118
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:30,124
That way, if you catch something really big,
we can come to help.

119
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,880
(Chuckles) He doesn't like to work far out.

120
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,923
His eyes are not so good any more.

121
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,678
I will see something that he doesn't.

122
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,997
I'll get him to go after marlin, like you.

123
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,277
- You, your eyes are still good?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,927
You're certainly strong enough for a big fish.

125
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,440
I think so.

126
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,722
Besides, there are tricks.

127
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:57,524
- You have something to eat?
- Yellow rice and fish.

128
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,363
Do you want some?

129
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:05,763
No. I'll eat at home.

130
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll make the fire.

131
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,757
SANTIAGO: No. We'll make it later.

132
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:18,807
First, I'll sit out here in the sun...
and read my paper.

133
00:10:22,807 --> 00:10:24,365
It's yesterday's.

134
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,564
Lopez gave it to me...at the terrace.

135
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:33,043
I will read about...the baseball.

136
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:35,083
I'll be back with the sardines.

137
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,839
You can tell me about baseball.

138
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,763
Oh. Will the Yankees win?

139
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,803
I have faith in the Yankees.

140
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,117
Think of...DiMaggio.

141
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:49,758
Yeah, but I fear the Indians of Cleveland.
And the Tigers of Detroit.

142
00:10:49,847 --> 00:10:52,919
- (Grunts)
- I'll be back with the sardines.

143
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:53,962
Right.

144
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,240
Excuse me, Lopez.
I would like to buy some food.

145
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:38,557
Tired of your mother's cooking, Manolo?

146
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:44,525
We have fried bananas,
black beans, rice, a stew...

147
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,837
Give me a little bit of each.

148
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:48,883
- You will eat it here?
- No, no.

149
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,121
And two beers.

150
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,482
Two beers. How much is that?

151
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:58,446
- Er... I will put it on your bill.
- Thank you.

152
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,643
You're a good boy, Manolo.

153
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,283
The sun's gone down.

154
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,403
You were very quiet.

155
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:31,322
- I brought you some...oranges, papaya.
- Thank you.

156
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,804
Mama's picture's not on the wall.

157
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:40,283
Oh, I put it on the table...where I can see it less.

158
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,285
Makes me too lonely.

159
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,841
Come inside.

160
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,883
I'm very comfortable here.

161
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,642
Papa...come inside.

162
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,683
<i>Bring your chair</i>.

163
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:58,043
- You won't stay long?
- No.

164
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,879
Good.

165
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,521
Thank you for the fruit.

166
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:13,280
84 days without a fish.

167
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,756
- You want to know how I know?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:21,159
Lopez's brother works in a market
on the same street where we live.

169
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,236
Oh.

170
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:26,115
Even in Havana,
we know about Santiago's bad luck.

171
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:31,524
Papa...Rodriguez moved out.

172
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:36,158
We have an extra room. Things are going well.
We don't need to rent the room any more.

173
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,920
I talked it over with Tomas. You come to us.

174
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,963
<i>You'll have your own room</i>.

175
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:44,323
Sit, read the paper, listen to the radio.

176
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,363
I can do that all right here.

177
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:49,007
I don't have to go to Havana.

178
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,403
Look at this place.

179
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:56,765
You and Mama didn't bring me up
in a place like this. Now you live like a hermit.

180
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,600
An old shack, dirty old blanket.

181
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,326
- It's good enough for me.
- Aye-aye-aye!

182
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,363
Same old story.

183
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:09,362
Papa, for years I've been saying, "Leave here,
come to Havana." And you always say, "No.

184
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,156
I go out every day, I catch fish, I'm a fisherman."

185
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,681
But God isn't giving you any more fish, Papa.

186
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:20,356
He's saying it's time now.
He wants you to come with me to Havana.

187
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh! Now you know what God is thinking.

188
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:27,877
I know he doesn't give you any more fish.

189
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,243
He thinks you're getting old.

190
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,965
(Grunts)

191
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,003
God will give me a fish.

192
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:38,919
A great fish.

193
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:41,396
- When?
- Tomorrow.

194
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,876
- And if not?
- The next day.

195
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,606
And if you die, the shame will be on me.

196
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,360
It's no shame for a man to die
the way he has lived.

197
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:53,516
Papa, please. I love you.

198
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,763
Thank you.

199
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:04,405
Then, please, let me stay here and...
and look for fish.

200
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,955
Papa, I'm sorry to say this. You're too old.

201
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:09,718
Oh. Excuse me.

202
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:13,038
- Manolo, you know my daughter Angela.
- A great pleasure.

203
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,240
What have you brought?

204
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:18,285
Black beans and rice,
fried bananas and some stew.

205
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,722
You see? I'm well taken care of. (Chuckles)

206
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:23,480
- You're a stubborn old man.
- And a great fisherman.

207
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,046
Was I talking to you?

208
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:27,880
- Come on, Angela...
- Very well, do as you please.

209
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:31,084
When the fish don't come,
you'll change your mind. I'll be back.

210
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,243
(Car engine starts)

211
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:44,040
Who gave you all this?

212
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,166
Lopez, at the terrace.

213
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:49,876
- I will have to thank him.
- I thanked him already.

214
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:54,403
I'd like to give him the belly of a...big fish.

215
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,682
Here.

216
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,203
Lopez is a very thoughtful man.

217
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,475
Oh. (Grunts contentedly)

218
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:14,719
(Chuckles) Oh!

219
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,922
Ohh!

220
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,999
- This stew is delicious.
- I'm glad you like it.

221
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,400
Tell me about baseball.

222
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,680
- Are you sure you want to hear all that again?
- Yes.

223
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:39,446
Well, in the American League, it is the Yankees.

224
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,284
And DiMaggio makes the difference.

225
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,837
- But they have other men on the team.
- Naturally.

226
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,403
Oh... (Chuckles)

227
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:52,001
I would like to take DiMaggio out fishing.

228
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:55,363
You know,
they say his father was a fisherman, just like us.

229
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,477
Just... Just as poor.

230
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,445
Dick Sisler's father, he was never poor.

231
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:04,644
No...but Dick Sisler was a great player.

232
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:09,406
Still, in the other league, I pick Brooklyn...
over Philadelphia.

233
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,006
(Laughs)

234
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:16,478
Remember when Dick Sisler came to
the terrace? I wanted to ask him to go fishing.

235
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:21,402
Oh, I was... I was too timid to ask him.

236
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:25,002
- You asked me to ask him.
- (Laughs) That's right.

237
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,443
- And I was too timid.
- Yeah, it was a great mistake.

238
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,483
He would have gone fishing with us.

239
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:33,602
Then we would have that for the rest of our lives.

240
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,477
Tell me... Who is the greatest manager? Really.

241
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,603
Dolf Luque or Mike Gonzalez?

242
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,836
Well...

243
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,640
..I would say they're equal.

244
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:51,599
And the best fisherman is you.

245
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:52,642
No.

246
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,601
I know a lot better.

247
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,365
There are many good fishermen.

248
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:00,403
There's some great ones, too.

249
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,926
There is only you.

250
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,366
Thank you. You make me very happy.

251
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,682
I hope no fish ever comes by so big
he will prove us both wrong.

252
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,723
You have to go to bed soon.

253
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,759
- I'll wake you up in the morning.
- You're my alarm clock.

254
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,803
Age is my alarm clock.

255
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,963
- Sleep well.
- Mm.

256
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,723
Ha-ha!

257
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,520
Hey, you've become very good with a net,
Santiago.

258
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,403
I had the best teacher.

259
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,842
I hope to become as great a fisherman as you.

260
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:17,485
Skill with a net, or the line, or the gaff
does not make a man a fisherman, Santiago.

261
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,563
One must always think of the fish.

262
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:26,324
We must kill them to survive...
but we must never forget the value of their lives.

263
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:28,363
<i>Their beauty, their courage</i>.

264
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,123
(Cock crows)

265
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:17,643
(Cock crows)

266
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,803
Manolo.

267
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,843
- Manolo.
- <i>Argh!</i>

268
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,883
Come on.

269
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,763
- No, no, no, come on.
- Yes.

270
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,803
(Santiago grunts)

271
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:58,644
- How did you sleep?
- Very well.

272
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:00,683
How do you feel?

273
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,123
Confident.

274
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:08,560
Me too.

275
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,326
Thank you.

276
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:12,079
Your wife is still asleep?

277
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,083
Most Americans sleep late.

278
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,880
I like early mornings. Quiet, no interruptions.

279
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,923
You are a journalist?

280
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,923
No, not at the moment.

281
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,520
A fine writer, then.

282
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,919
Writer, yes. Fine is open to question.

283
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,282
It must be hard work.

284
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:38,115
It is right now. At least for me.

285
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,675
- Se?or like some breakfast?
- <i>Later</i>.

286
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,797
- You don't mind if I work here?
- No, no.

287
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,843
For me, it would be an honour.

288
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:20,045
- You have nothing to eat?
- For today I have enough.

289
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,083
Come on now.

290
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:33,601
Good luck!

291
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,923
Good luck to you.

292
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,046
Excuse me.

293
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:09,119
The old man out there,
the one alone in the boat.

294
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:11,163
He was here yesterday with the boy.

295
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:13,203
Ah, Santiago.

296
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,047
- He goes out alone?
- Yes.

297
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:21,076
Are they related, the old man and the boy?

298
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:24,079
Not by blood, but by affection.

299
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,442
The old man has taught the boy to fish.

300
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,246
Now the boy goes on another boat.

301
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,399
The old man's bound to catch something...
isn't he?

302
00:23:34,487 --> 00:23:36,443
Who can say?

303
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:45,563
I worked this for a week...

304
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:49,723
..and I caught nothing.

305
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,321
Another day here is a wasted day.

306
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,683
I have no time for that.

307
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,041
If they hear me talking out loud to myself...

308
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:05,524
..they'll think I'm a...crazy old man.

309
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:14,965
When did I start talking...out loud to myself?

310
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,035
I used to sing...

311
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,723
..in the old days.

312
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:31,836
(Hums)

313
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,163
# La-da-da-da-da-da-dum

314
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,323
# La-la-la

315
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,083
# Ah-dee-da-dum

316
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,123
But the talking...

317
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:46,763
..that came...

318
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,163
..after the boy left...

319
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,163
..I think.

320
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:57,963
I'm not crazy.

321
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:01,643
And since I am not crazy...

322
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:05,803
..I don't care what anybody thinks!

323
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:15,603
The rich...have radios on their boat...

324
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:19,083
..and they listen to baseball.

325
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:24,356
Now is not the time to think of baseball.

326
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,923
You have to think of only one thing.

327
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:34,600
The fish.

328
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,763
(Squawks)

329
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:45,923
Bird!

330
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,963
You want to come and ride with me?

331
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:52,679
<i>No</i>.

332
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,723
(Chuckles)

333
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,763
You have no faith.

334
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:03,036
Virgin fishermen...must have faith.

335
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,083
And some luck.

336
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,365
A lot of luck.

337
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,119
(Hums)

338
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,201
# La-da-da-da-da-da-da-dee-da-da

339
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:32,319
- Good morning.
- Good morning, se?ora.

340
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:36,081
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

341
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:11,003
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

342
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,043
- Slept well?
- Uh-huh.

343
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,081
Working?

344
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,520
Yeah.

345
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,363
Something new?

346
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:26,077
- Notes.
- Notes?

347
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:28,442
For what? A short story, a novel?

348
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:33,205
- I don't know yet.
- Oh.

349
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,803
Don't sound so disappointed.

350
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,481
You've been taking notes for a long time now.

351
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,923
Time is relative.

352
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:45,963
Einstein.

353
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,843
Time discovers truth.

354
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,843
Anonymous.

355
00:27:53,887 --> 00:27:55,843
You made that up.

356
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:59,043
Perhaps I did.

357
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,803
That fisherman.

358
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:06,526
That old man we saw here yesterday
with the boy.

359
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:08,916
- You're changing the subject.
- That's right.

360
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:13,637
That old man has been out for 84 days...
without catching a fish.

361
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,883
Maybe he's doing something wrong.

362
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,483
Around here, they say he has bad luck.

363
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,603
That's one way to explain failure.

364
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,240
You're all heart.

365
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,523
I'm glad you noticed.

366
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:40,164
I could tie the rope around my toe.

367
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,083
Sleep and drift.

368
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:48,283
But wait.

369
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,123
Today is not a day for sleeping.

370
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,205
Today I should fish...

371
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,203
..the best I can.

372
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:22,163
Se?ora.

373
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,163
Would you like something to eat?

374
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,203
- Do you make eggs?
- Of course.

375
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:31,836
- Se?or?
- Yes, eggs. Fine.

376
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,806
Are you going to see about the car
this morning?

377
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,240
Yeah.

378
00:30:00,847 --> 00:30:04,283
That bird is not just looking.
He's found something.

379
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,763
The bird is a...big help.

380
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:33,640
Oh!

381
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:36,241
It's bonita...or tuna.

382
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:40,440
Oh!

383
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:43,119
<i>Thank you, my friend</i>.

384
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,883
Could be marlin.

385
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,043
This far out...

386
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:52,083
could be very big.

387
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:57,960
This one...

388
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:02,763
..could be huge.

389
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:14,483
Fish...please make a turn.

390
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:18,963
Come back!

391
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:24,603
Smell the sardines.

392
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:30,796
They're hard...cold and tasty.

393
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:38,443
Oh, Christ!

394
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:43,403
I lost him.

395
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:46,643
Damn it!

396
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:50,163
He's gone.

397
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,923
(Water plops)

398
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,883
He's come back.

399
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:03,483
He was just making a turn.

400
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,243
Don't play games with me, fish.

401
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,040
Eat it...or do not eat it...

402
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,883
..but do not play games with me.

403
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,763
He's taken it.

404
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,083
He's taken it!

405
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:27,839
Eat it!

406
00:33:27,927 --> 00:33:29,519
<i>Swallow it!</i>

407
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,405
Come on, fish! Swallow it.

408
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:33,522
Swallow it.

409
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,524
Now!

410
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:47,443
Oh, God, I've got a fish!

411
00:33:49,567 --> 00:33:51,956
I am being pulled by a fish!

412
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,203
I could make the line fast.

413
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:02,843
But then he could break it.

414
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,727
I'll have to...hold him while I can.

415
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:13,362
Thank God he is travelling...not going down.

416
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:19,163
I wish I could see him.

417
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:23,837
Then I would know what I have against me.

418
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,563
What if he goes down deep?

419
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,603
What do I do?

420
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,803
I don't know.

421
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:45,485
I'll do something.

422
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:54,285
It's OK now.
It shouldn't give you any more trouble.

423
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:56,676
- All fixed?
- Yeah.

424
00:34:56,767 --> 00:35:00,077
- Nice car. Bring it down from the States?
- Yeah.

425
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:04,240
Lucky to find a water pump
for this model Packard, even in Havana.

426
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,843
I guess we'd better settle up.

427
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,523
Are you interested in selling it?

428
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,080
- Selling it? The car?
- Mm-hm.

429
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,965
I have a customer
who's looking for a model like this.

430
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,480
I'll make you good price.

431
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:26,037
This car's been a lot of places with me.

432
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:30,837
Sometimes you need a change.
Both you <i>and</i> the car.

433
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:36,123
(Bell tolls)

434
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:07,243
- Is the car ready?
- Yeah.

435
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,719
I bought this for you.

436
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:14,960
I sold the car.

437
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,039
What?

438
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:19,242
Hey, ni?o.

439
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,366
- For you.
- Thank you, se?or.

440
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:28,960
Let's get a drink.

441
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:33,486
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

442
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,123
Was that a joke about the car?

443
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,123
No.

444
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,801
You mean you actually sold it
without discussing it?

445
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:44,843
With you?

446
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:48,283
Yes, I guess I did just that.

447
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:49,880
Sorry.

448
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,640
Is this the beginning of something
I should know about?

449
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:56,958
Are we ridding ourselves
of all our worldly possessions?

450
00:36:57,047 --> 00:37:02,075
- That car was big and flashy and ostentatious.
- And that's what we loved about it.

451
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,083
Beginning to need a lot of work.

452
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:08,766
- Today the water pump...
- Tomorrow the world.

453
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,883
So what's on the schedule now?

454
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:15,003
(Sighs)

455
00:37:16,047 --> 00:37:18,003
I'd like to stay here for a while.

456
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:20,806
- Here? Meaning this town?
- Yes.

457
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:23,605
You like it here, don't you?

458
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:29,319
The thing that I would like most
is to know a little about what you're thinking.

459
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:32,444
Well, you know.
I've been thinking about that old man.

460
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,641
84 days without a fish.

461
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:39,559
I mean, how do you deal with that?

462
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:42,280
Maybe you should ask him.

463
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,323
People are very private.

464
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:48,082
You just don't go up and hit them
with a question about their feelings.

465
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:51,239
You're liable to get an answer like,
"Mind your own business."

466
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,317
- More politely, probably.
- Probably.

467
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,883
Two more hours before sunset.

468
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:31,283
Maybe you'll come up before that.

469
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:36,679
Maybe...you'll come up with the moon.

470
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,564
Fish...

471
00:38:42,647 --> 00:38:44,444
I'm still strong.

472
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:47,684
And you...

473
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,519
You have the hook in your mouth!

474
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,283
Why did you do that, fish?

475
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:07,238
Are you tired of the hook in your mouth?

476
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:10,243
I'm damn tired too!

477
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,683
First blood to you, fish.

478
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:22,605
You're still too strong for me.

479
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,483
I think I'll take a walk.

480
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,523
OK.

481
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,683
Manolo, more ice, uh?

482
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,403
I don't have time for two fish.

483
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,563
I'm here with a friend.

484
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:09,163
Maybe if I...pull him up a little...

485
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,123
..he will jump.

486
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,723
Just gently.

487
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:22,924
Come on. Come on.

488
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,002
God!

489
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:28,485
You are like a tree.

490
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:31,920
Give me some line.

491
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,643
Come on!

492
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:37,363
(Groans)

493
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:45,603
Second round for you.

494
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,483
You cut my hand.

495
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:52,483
Why did I let you do that?

496
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,599
I must be going crazy.

497
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:02,364
I'd better pay more attention...to my work.

498
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,001
What time is it?

499
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,845
Two o'clock, about.

500
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:31,206
Can't sleep?

501
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,119
The old man didn't come back.

502
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:39,439
Come back to bed. You'd better get some sleep.

503
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:41,965
A little while.

504
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:06,603
I should eat something.

505
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:21,203
I wish the boy was here.

506
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:36,960
I also wish I had some...salt.

507
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:40,200
And lime.

508
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,562
Lime! Lime!

509
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:45,122
What?

510
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,163
- I found them.
- Oh, good.

511
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,203
Cut them.

512
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:52,120
And squeeze the juice...all over the fish.

513
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,523
It's good with lime.

514
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:15,723
- Here.
- Oh.

515
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:17,763
Thank you.

516
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:22,725
How old was l
when you first took me out into the boat?

517
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,763
You always ask that question!

518
00:44:24,847 --> 00:44:27,156
Well, I like to hear the answer.

519
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:31,963
You were five.

520
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,478
- And I was almost killed.
- Yes.

521
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:37,398
How was that?

522
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:38,761
I told you.

523
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,839
Here.

524
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:48,486
How was that?

525
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:52,282
All right!

526
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,005
I brought in a fish too green.

527
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,442
It nearly tore the boat to pieces.

528
00:44:57,527 --> 00:45:00,166
I can remember the tail slapping,

529
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,203
and the banging,

530
00:45:02,287 --> 00:45:04,243
and the noise of you clubbing.

531
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:08,643
I remember you throwing me down onto the bow
with the wet line.

532
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,037
And then the whole boat started to shake.

533
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:16,119
And...the noise of you clubbing him,

534
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:18,767
it... it was like the chopping down of a tree.

535
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:24,163
The smell of blood all over me.

536
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:28,003
You remember because I told you...

537
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,563
..all of that.

538
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:33,000
Many times.

539
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:36,796
I remember everything, from the very first day.

540
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:40,765
This is good.

541
00:45:40,847 --> 00:45:43,281
Everything that comes out of the sea is good.

542
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,961
Except Portuguese man-of-war.

543
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,805
And sharks.

544
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:51,843
<i>But you can't blame her for those</i>.

545
00:45:56,727 --> 00:45:59,002
What was the biggest fish you ever caught?

546
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,683
(Chuckles) I don't remember.

547
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:05,723
You remember!

548
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,763
I've seen some great fish.

549
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:14,447
I've seen some fish that weigh...
nearly a thousand pounds.

550
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,483
Oh, excuse me.

551
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,558
Caught, I asked.

552
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:20,046
Caught?

553
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:27,203
I don't know.

554
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,642
Er...two.

555
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:32,600
Yes, two.

556
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:35,121
That... That size.

557
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:39,126
- A thousand pounds?
- Yeah!

558
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,126
Were you alone on the boat?

559
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:45,922
No.

560
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:49,880
You were not with me.

561
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:53,322
No.

562
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,004
It's not right that I wasn't there.

563
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:00,883
(Rumble of thunder)

564
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:22,486
LOPEZ: <i>He was here when I came here</i>
<i>ten years ago</i>.

565
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:25,639
I was working as a busboy in Havana.

566
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:31,199
A cousin who was from here
told me about a job as a second barman here.

567
00:47:32,247 --> 00:47:36,479
And I was so tired of carrying dishes,
so eager to move up into the world,

568
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,445
so I came here,
and I have been here ever since.

569
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:45,117
Quiet people, good, hard working, honourable.
Never is there trouble.

570
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:49,000
But what about the old man - Santiago?

571
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:52,357
He was alone even when I came here.

572
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:56,565
His wife had died.
His daughter was married, living in Havana.

573
00:47:57,287 --> 00:47:59,005
So he was very much alone.

574
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:03,126
But he's a proud man.
Keeps to himself, very little to say.

575
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,799
<i>And I am very fond of him</i>.

576
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,323
And during these bad times,
I have done what I can.

577
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:11,363
But like I say, he's very proud.

578
00:48:11,447 --> 00:48:15,281
And whatever I can do,
I must do through the boy.

579
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,921
Is he the oldest of the fishermen here?

580
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:23,285
Who can tell? A young man catches a fish
or he doesn't catch a fish.

581
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,323
That is the only difference.

582
00:48:26,447 --> 00:48:28,483
Why are you so interested in this man?

583
00:48:29,527 --> 00:48:32,644
Cos he hasn't caught a fish for 84 days.

584
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:34,683
And he hasn't given up.

585
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:39,076
There's a dignity there that's...extraordinary.

586
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,004
Writers think that way, I suppose.

587
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,359
He didn't come back yesterday.

588
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:48,120
-Who?
- Santiago.

589
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:50,960
He went out in the morning,
but he never came back.

590
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:54,562
Excuse me, I must er...serve the others.

591
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:56,205
Don't you care?

592
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:03,443
Respect. More important than life - respect.

593
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,798
All right, fish...I admit it.

594
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:21,043
I'm a little tired.

595
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,523
My head is light.

596
00:49:25,807 --> 00:49:27,763
If you're not tired...

597
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,885
..you... you must be very strange.

598
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:39,527
<i>I would like to show you</i>...<i>what kind of man I am</i>.

599
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:45,560
<i>I would change places with you, fish, if I could</i>.

600
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:51,362
Down there in the darkness...
and the cold of the sea.

601
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:59,116
Come on up, fish...and face me.

602
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:04,526
I challenge you...one to one.

603
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:08,081
Man to man.

604
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:12,726
(Shouts of encouragement)

605
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:21,961
Getting tired, Santiago?

606
00:50:23,407 --> 00:50:25,875
- How many hours is it?
- More than eight.

607
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:29,437
Don't worry, Absalom.
You'll lose in time to load sugar in the morning.

608
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,121
And you're gonna lose. Now.

609
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:50,601
Give me some rum!

610
00:50:58,047 --> 00:50:59,196
Here.

611
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:03,963
What time is it?

612
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:08,243
4O minutes past five.

613
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:11,283
I made you a promise, Absalom.

614
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:25,605
Congratulations.

615
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:28,679
SANTIAGO:
<i>When I was young, I could beat anyone</i>.

616
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:31,883
If I wanted to badly enough.

617
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:38,916
Fish...I will stay with you till I die.

618
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:45,197
And you will stay with me too...I suppose.

619
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:50,883
(Aeroplane overhead)

620
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:56,083
<i>Oh</i>.

621
00:51:58,127 --> 00:52:00,083
I wonder how it feels,

622
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:03,921
to be in an aeroplane, looking down on the sea.

623
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,643
I would like to fly slowly...

624
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:12,603
..and look at the fish.

625
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:26,964
- Why is it, do you think?
- Why is what?

626
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:30,003
- Fruit in drink.
- What about it?

627
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:33,203
Fruit in drink in tropical places.

628
00:52:33,287 --> 00:52:36,165
In Northern climates, they drink alcohol straight.

629
00:52:36,247 --> 00:52:39,523
Availability. The abundance of fruit in the tropics.

630
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:41,677
- You think that?
- I do.

631
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,406
- Would you like to hear my theory?
- I would.

632
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:49,286
I think that in the tropics,
people drink for pleasure.

633
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,880
In Northern climates,
they drink to avoid depression.

634
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,923
Well, that's a theory.

635
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:57,963
I don't like all this fruit in my drink...

636
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,317
..because I am now drinking
to avoid depression.

637
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,603
Are you bored here?

638
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:09,283
I feel at loose ends.

639
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:15,163
I-I don't... I don't feel very useful
to myself, or to anyone else.

640
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,965
I can't leave here right now.

641
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:22,005
Something is happening.
I have to find out what it is.

642
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:23,884
If I don't, I'm lost.

643
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:26,606
Where does that leave me?

644
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:30,243
I love you. You know that.

645
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:31,806
Do l?

646
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:39,203
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

647
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,843
Wait for me.

648
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:47,243
Wait for me.

649
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:05,285
What's the matter, hand?

650
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,005
You got a cramp?

651
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:12,723
You can't.

652
00:54:15,927 --> 00:54:18,316
I'll open you up myself, if I have to.

653
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:31,322
Come on, hand.

654
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:35,126
Help me. Please.

655
00:54:37,687 --> 00:54:39,279
That's it.

656
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:43,283
Aah!

657
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:46,165
(Grunts)

658
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,360
He's coming up.

659
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:54,039
Come on, hand.

660
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,516
Please. Help me!

661
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,998
Holy Mary...

662
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,679
..Mother of God.

663
00:55:41,607 --> 00:55:44,201
Make him pay for the line.

664
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,722
Make him pay for it.

665
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:53,476
Don't break it, fish.

666
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,523
<i>Don't break the line</i>.

667
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:16,003
<i>How many times did you jump?</i>

668
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:19,283
Many.

669
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,323
The sacs of your back...

670
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,563
..are filled with air.

671
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,323
You can't go deep again.

672
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:35,963
Now...

673
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,595
..I will be able to work you.

674
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,481
Now...I must show you how strong I am.

675
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:03,118
Damn fish! You are killing me!

676
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:07,880
I don't care...who kills who.

677
00:57:09,567 --> 00:57:10,841
You have the right.

678
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:17,325
I love and respect you...very much,

679
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,079
but before this day ends...

680
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:23,640
..I will kill you.

681
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:26,878
- Did you see Santiago?
- No, I haven't seen him.

682
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,086
Santiago?

683
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:47,521
Damn it!

684
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:22,403
<i>Don't go mad on me, fish</i>.

685
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,923
And please...

686
00:58:27,407 --> 00:58:30,080
..please don't do anything foolish.

687
00:58:31,727 --> 00:58:34,082
<i>My God!</i>

688
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:36,406
I wish the boy could see this.

689
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:46,046
He's gone.

690
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:48,365
Be strong, old man.

691
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:01,843
I want to see you. I want to see you clearly.

692
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:06,523
<i>Come closer, fish</i>.

693
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,799
<i>Please come closer</i>.

694
00:59:09,887 --> 00:59:13,038
I've been waiting for you for... for a long time.

695
00:59:21,967 --> 00:59:23,923
I must land it.

696
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:56,523
I have taken this fish...

697
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:00,603
..which was my brother.

698
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:09,443
Now to work.

699
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,523
May we sit with you?

700
01:00:35,927 --> 01:00:37,883
Sure.

701
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,763
The old man is your friend?

702
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,637
We've been fishing together many times.

703
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,399
How old is he?

704
01:00:53,847 --> 01:00:55,360
I don't know.

705
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,403
What difference does it make?

706
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,323
- Will he come back?
- Yes.

707
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:05,443
And with a fish.

708
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:08,483
He's a great fisherman.

709
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,723
He's more than that.

710
01:01:12,847 --> 01:01:15,805
Once...I was in the boat with him.

711
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,079
And he hooked one marlin of two, of a pair.

712
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:23,003
The female.

713
01:01:23,087 --> 01:01:25,043
She always feeds before the male.

714
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:30,721
The female fought against the line,
and the male crossed and made circles.

715
01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:33,640
Santiago was afraid he'd cut the line with his tail.

716
01:01:34,687 --> 01:01:38,839
So Santiago gaffed the female. We clubbed her.

717
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:44,365
And the male, which was at the side of the boat,
jumped high in the air...

718
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,243
..to see where the female was.

719
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:50,283
She was beautiful.

720
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,243
And he had stayed.

721
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:57,965
The old man said,

722
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,122
"That was the saddest thing I ever saw."

723
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:05,240
I was sad too.

724
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:14,243
- How long did the male stay?
- Till she was butchered.

725
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,683
We live this way.

726
01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:27,040
I must go now.

727
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,687
- Is there anything we can do?
- No.

728
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:31,723
He will come back.

729
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,440
I would stay by the boat.

730
01:02:46,807 --> 01:02:47,876
What?

731
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,925
(Sighs)

732
01:02:53,447 --> 01:02:57,122
Like the male marlin.
If anything ever happened, I would be there.

733
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,079
Fifteen...hundred pounds.

734
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:37,803
Maybe more.

735
01:03:39,647 --> 01:03:41,603
At 3O cents a pound...

736
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:46,759
Oh. I need a pencil for that.

737
01:03:52,447 --> 01:03:54,403
Maybe it was a sin to kill this fish.

738
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:58,320
Why?

739
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:00,967
I was born a fisherman, the fish was born a fish.

740
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,123
St Peter was a fisherman.

741
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,363
So was DiMaggio's father.

742
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:16,163
Anyway, I loved him.

743
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:20,683
So there is no sin.

744
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,966
Come on!
You have no understanding what sin is.

745
01:04:32,647 --> 01:04:34,797
Fifteen hundred pounds.

746
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:34,277
Please, old man. Come back.

747
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,605
With a little wind...

748
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:42,683
..and a little luck...

749
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:45,805
..we'll be home soon, fish.

750
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:50,646
(Hums) # La-dee

751
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:55,084
# Dee-dee-da-da-da-dee-da-dee-da-da

752
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,440
Where you been?

753
01:06:02,527 --> 01:06:05,405
Well, I asked around, and found Town Hall.

754
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:09,366
Got a hold of some official and told him
that a fisherman had been gone for two days.

755
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:10,800
And?

756
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:15,278
Well, I got a lot of smiles
and assurances that this was not unusual,

757
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:18,086
and that there was no way of keeping track
of all the boats.

758
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:20,601
Lopez gave me the same answers.

759
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:23,645
What about hiring a boat
and looking for him ourselves?

760
01:06:24,887 --> 01:06:27,162
We wouldn't have a chance in hell
of finding him.

761
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:30,000
And...I don't think he'd want that.

762
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,558
So you think we should just do nothing?

763
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:34,877
We're not doing nothing, we're waiting.

764
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:40,877
Like the boy, we're waiting...
and trying to understand. That's something.

765
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:42,320
Isn't it?

766
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,843
I woke up...and you were gone.

767
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,316
I should have left a note.

768
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:58,000
# La-da-da-da-da-la-da-la-dee

769
01:06:58,087 --> 01:06:59,566
# La-la-dee

770
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:00,762
# La-dee-la-la

771
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:02,166
# Da...

772
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:06,365
<i>Oh, my God</i>.

773
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,563
It was too good to last.

774
01:07:08,647 --> 01:07:10,603
He's going to hit me.

775
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,557
I cannot stop him.

776
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:22,196
I can try.

777
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:50,803
I got him!

778
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:54,999
Aie! He got me.

779
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:59,282
Damn. My harpoon.

780
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:02,563
And all the rope.

781
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,965
Fish...you are bleeding.

782
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,322
Soon there will be others.

783
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:20,123
Don't think, old man.

784
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,878
Sail this course...

785
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,363
..and take what comes.

786
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:42,481
<i>But I have to think</i>.

787
01:08:44,647 --> 01:08:46,603
It's all I have left.

788
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:50,403
That and baseball.

789
01:08:52,487 --> 01:08:54,079
(Chuckles)

790
01:08:54,167 --> 01:08:56,476
Joe...I hit him.

791
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:59,723
A good, clean hit.

792
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:02,923
Not a home run like you,

793
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:06,716
but a...good, clean hit.

794
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,963
The wound is bleeding.

795
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:18,680
They will come back.

796
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:22,562
I have to...protect myself.

797
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:43,563
I wish I had a stone...

798
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,763
..to sharpen this knife.

799
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:52,443
But I didn't bring one.

800
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,963
It's all right.

801
01:09:57,087 --> 01:09:59,203
Don't think of what you didn't bring.

802
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:02,596
You must think of... of what you have.

803
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:05,443
I have hope.

804
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:10,316
Then...think of hope.

805
01:10:13,927 --> 01:10:15,360
<i>And the good old days</i>.

806
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:17,915
Santiago and Maria...

807
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:20,077
(Wedding ceremony in Latin)

808
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:38,566
(Cheering and applause)

809
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:10,606
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

810
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:13,997
- Come on, come with me.
- I am, Santiago.

811
01:11:18,447 --> 01:11:22,201
- Oh, my dress is going to be ruined!
- You won't need it again.

812
01:11:25,287 --> 01:11:27,801
- You know this boat?
- Of course.

813
01:11:27,887 --> 01:11:29,843
This is the boat.

814
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:36,280
This morning, at our wedding,
I gave you my heart. Now here...

815
01:11:36,367 --> 01:11:38,323
I promise you...

816
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:42,163
..I will take fish from the sea...

817
01:11:45,007 --> 01:11:46,963
..as long as I live.

818
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,083
Luck comes in many forms.

819
01:11:55,087 --> 01:11:57,043
I'll take it in any form.

820
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:12,324
- Lopez...do you have the newspaper of today?
- Yes.

821
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:14,716
- May I borrow it, please?
- Behind the bar.

822
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:16,763
Thank you.

823
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:27,243
You can keep it.

824
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:29,283
Oh. Thank you.

825
01:12:36,807 --> 01:12:38,763
He cannot read.

826
01:12:39,807 --> 01:12:42,116
Are you sure? He seemed to be reading.

827
01:12:42,207 --> 01:12:45,882
Match scores. Baseball.
The old man taught him.

828
01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:56,599
Santiago!

829
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,875
The Yankees beat the Tigers...twice!

830
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:01,923
9-2 and 7-6!

831
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,316
DiMaggio... Listen, old man!

832
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:06,363
DiMaggio had five hits!

833
01:13:06,447 --> 01:13:09,041
Two home runs! One in each game!

834
01:13:09,127 --> 01:13:11,721
Listen, old man! DiMaggio's well again!

835
01:13:13,647 --> 01:13:15,603
He can't hear you.

836
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:19,446
You're making a fool of yourself,
calling out like that.

837
01:13:19,527 --> 01:13:20,880
He can hear me.

838
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,923
No sound is lost.

839
01:13:23,007 --> 01:13:26,238
Every sound from the beginning of time
is still in the air.

840
01:13:26,327 --> 01:13:29,285
- Who told you that?
- He did.

841
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:32,359
Sound isn't lost when there's no-one to hear it.

842
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:35,363
He's out there.

843
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:38,523
Maybe alive, and maybe not.

844
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:42,603
Why?

845
01:13:42,687 --> 01:13:44,643
Cos foolish people like you...

846
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,600
..tell him what a great fisherman he is.

847
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:50,643
Tell him how strong, cunning he is.

848
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:54,076
Truth is, he's an old and weak, stubborn man.

849
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,362
- No! You know nothing!
- Be quiet.

850
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:57,800
You live in the city.

851
01:13:57,887 --> 01:14:01,323
You walk into a store
and the food has been through many hands.

852
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:04,558
And then you open your purse,
and the food is yours.

853
01:14:04,647 --> 01:14:06,603
Don't preach to me.

854
01:14:06,687 --> 01:14:10,043
I know this place. I was born and raised here.
I know the life.

855
01:14:11,567 --> 01:14:13,444
We're talking about my father.

856
01:14:13,527 --> 01:14:14,880
Yes, and m...

857
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:21,205
Sorry.

858
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:27,920
Have you heard anything from someone...
someone who's seen him?

859
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,235
No.

860
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:36,880
A cousin of Lopez, who told me,
said he went...far out.

861
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:38,366
That's true.

862
01:14:39,927 --> 01:14:41,883
People will say,

863
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:45,004
"Angela, you didn't take care of your father."

864
01:14:46,407 --> 01:14:51,162
"Angela, a good daughter provides for her father
in his old age."

865
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,643
Well...God knows, I tried.

866
01:14:57,967 --> 01:15:00,879
In my next life, my father will be a tailor.

867
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:35,883
Again. My God.

868
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:55,203
Come on. Come on.

869
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:56,959
Which one is first?

870
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:49,640
You took my knife.

871
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,443
Go and show it to your brother!

872
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:08,523
I'm sorry, fish.

873
01:17:09,567 --> 01:17:10,886
I wish I...

874
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,883
..I had never hooked you.

875
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:21,321
This makes...everything wrong.

876
01:17:25,927 --> 01:17:27,883
I shouldn't have gone out so far.

877
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,123
Either for me...

878
01:17:35,727 --> 01:17:37,683
..or for you.

879
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:56,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

880
01:17:57,847 --> 01:17:59,803
- Cigarette?
- Oh, thanks.

881
01:18:04,127 --> 01:18:06,083
I had a funny dream.

882
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,840
- Do you want to hear it?
- Sure.

883
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:16,159
I dreamt that the fisherman, the old man...

884
01:18:17,207 --> 01:18:19,163
..was picked up by a big boat.

885
01:18:19,247 --> 01:18:20,760
A liner.

886
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:25,398
And in my dream, the... the boat looked like
the wreck for Conte di Savoia.

887
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:30,042
They picked him up, and gave him a big dinner.

888
01:18:31,527 --> 01:18:33,483
Risotto Milanese.

889
01:18:33,567 --> 01:18:35,398
Osso buco.

890
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:38,403
Oh, the food looked so good.

891
01:18:39,727 --> 01:18:41,683
Are you hungry?

892
01:18:43,047 --> 01:18:45,003
No.

893
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:52,883
Wake me if something happens.

894
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:55,883
OK.

895
01:19:07,447 --> 01:19:09,403
- I love you.
- I know that.

896
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:56,683
You're tired, old man.

897
01:20:04,127 --> 01:20:06,083
Tired inside.

898
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,125
<i>Get away!</i>

899
01:21:00,927 --> 01:21:01,916
Eat that!

900
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:07,281
Come on!

901
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:13,758
Eat that!

902
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:18,123
Damn it, he did!

903
01:22:09,687 --> 01:22:11,643
(Groans)

904
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:22,043
(Bell tolls)

905
01:23:32,847 --> 01:23:33,962
He's back!

906
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:36,356
- You saw him?
- The boat. But it's still far off.

907
01:23:36,447 --> 01:23:38,403
I thought you wanted to know.

908
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:40,000
Manolo!

909
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:41,600
Thanks.

910
01:23:41,687 --> 01:23:43,166
It's nothing.

911
01:23:53,607 --> 01:23:54,756
Santiago!

912
01:23:56,527 --> 01:23:58,119
MANOLO: <i>Santiago!</i>

913
01:23:58,207 --> 01:24:01,643
- He's back. The boy saw the boat.
- Oh, thank God.

914
01:24:01,727 --> 01:24:03,683
(Bell tolls)
- What's that?

915
01:24:04,687 --> 01:24:06,120
It's Sunday.

916
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,640
I'd forgotten.

917
01:25:45,527 --> 01:25:47,677
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

918
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:50,440
- Let me help you.
- I'm all right, I said!

919
01:26:20,807 --> 01:26:24,163
I never thought...
in my whole life I'd see such a fish.

920
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:28,643
They beat me, Manolo.

921
01:26:29,927 --> 01:26:31,280
They truly beat me.

922
01:26:32,607 --> 01:26:33,881
The fish...

923
01:26:34,967 --> 01:26:36,798
..he didn't beat you.

924
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:39,879
No.

925
01:26:40,927 --> 01:26:42,883
Afterwards.

926
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,436
The sharks.

927
01:26:47,487 --> 01:26:49,443
The sharks.

928
01:26:49,527 --> 01:26:51,483
Here, wait. Let me help you.

929
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:53,523
- (Whimpers)
- Please!

930
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:55,359
No, no. Please.

931
01:26:55,447 --> 01:26:57,403
You stay here.

932
01:27:39,007 --> 01:27:40,281
Papa!

933
01:27:42,167 --> 01:27:43,361
I'm all right.

934
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,843
I'm all right.

935
01:27:54,967 --> 01:27:59,006
- <i>I'm fine</i>.
- I can see that.

936
01:28:04,087 --> 01:28:05,805
I'm fine.

937
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:07,878
You're a stubborn old man.

938
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:26,723
You'll come to see your grandchildren soon?

939
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:30,878
Yeah. Sure.

940
01:28:33,927 --> 01:28:35,076
Sure.

941
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:40,403
Soon.

942
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:45,725
- Santiago!
- They're calling you.

943
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:47,445
I'm not deaf.

944
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:51,076
Santiago! This is a truly great fish, Santiago!

945
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:53,123
<i>This is a champion fish!</i>

946
01:28:53,207 --> 01:28:55,163
<i>And your bad luck is over, old man!</i>

947
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:58,364
<i>You're not unlucky any more, Santiago!</i>

948
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:12,603
- Did you sleep?
- Yeah.

949
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:17,916
- Are you all right?
- Just my hands.

950
01:29:23,447 --> 01:29:25,403
What did you catch?

951
01:29:25,487 --> 01:29:28,763
One on the first day, two on the second,
and two on the third.

952
01:29:30,967 --> 01:29:32,923
Very good.

953
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:40,923
I can go fishing with you again.

954
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:42,759
I still have much to learn.

955
01:29:51,207 --> 01:29:52,162
Here.

956
01:29:52,247 --> 01:29:55,478
We need a good killing lance.
And we must always have it on board.

957
01:29:57,527 --> 01:29:59,802
- I lost my knife.
- I have another.

958
01:30:03,407 --> 01:30:05,841
How many days of bad weather
do you think we have?

959
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:09,683
Three or four.

960
01:30:09,767 --> 01:30:11,439
My hands will be healed by then.

961
01:30:12,527 --> 01:30:14,438
I'll have everything ready.

962
01:30:17,407 --> 01:30:19,557
I missed you out there.

963
01:30:27,727 --> 01:30:29,683
What a fish.

964
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,725
Great loss.

965
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:40,763
But a great gain.

966
01:30:44,287 --> 01:30:46,243
You see, you can be destroyed...

967
01:30:48,447 --> 01:30:50,244
..but not defeated.

968
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:55,878
What do you think about the Yankees?

969
01:30:57,687 --> 01:30:59,837
- How are they doing?
- They won!

970
01:30:59,927 --> 01:31:02,282
- <i>Twice</i>.
- I didn't have a radio on the boat.

971
01:31:03,407 --> 01:31:06,160
- Tell me. DiMaggio, he played?
- He's well again.

972
01:31:06,247 --> 01:31:08,203
Yes, DiMaggio is well again.

973
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:09,879
- He... He had a spur.
- It's gone!

974
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:11,559
- It's gone?
- He runs like a deer!

975
01:31:11,647 --> 01:31:13,683
- The operation was good, huh?
- Yes.

976
01:31:13,767 --> 01:31:18,124
That's wonderful. So...is he gonna...
is he gonna win the pennant?

977
01:31:18,207 --> 01:31:21,438
- Definitely. Have faith in DiMaggio!
(Santiago laughs)

978
01:31:21,527 --> 01:31:24,087
Now you are becoming like me.
