1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,145
Yo, Ug.
Nigga, put that shit out, man.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,875
I'll show you.

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,910
I am. I'm gonna show you, for real.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,346
I'll see you in Miami on Friday, right?

5
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,881
No doubt. I'm gonna be there.
- All right.

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:14,848
Y'all get home safe.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,584
Muah. Bye.
- Bye.

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,777
Take care.
- Bye, guys.

9
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,554
I want a big endorsement
next time, too, a'ight?

10
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,989
I got you. I'll make some phone calls.

11
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,190
Are you ready to go, sir?

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,359
Wait. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,660
A'ight, we out, we out.

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,227
You sure?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,729
You sure?
You ready? You ready?

16
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,964
Yeah.

17
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,333
Yo, Ug, pass me that bottle, baby.

18
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,527
Here you go. Good looks.

19
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,737
Whoo. Yes, sir.

20
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,327
I'm saying, Sage, what is this
you got us listenin' to, man?

21
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,657
Yo, you got to keep an open mind, man.

22
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:07,523
I hear all that, man,
but, yo, check this out.

23
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,137
Unh.

24
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,700
Yo, I'm saying, man, what's up
with that meeting at Atlantic?

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,671
Hey, 12:00 Monday, man.
Jason Flom is feelin' us.

26
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,707
Plus he even took a copy of the CD.

27
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:46,807
Okay.

28
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:53,647
We're good to go.

29
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:59,578
Yo, Ug.

30
00:01:59,755 --> 00:02:02,553
Keep Luther on a leash.

31
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:05,061
Yo, in and out, nigga.
Yo, I'm not playin', a'ight?

32
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:07,029
I don't want no fucking bodies.

33
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,292
A'ight, man.
I got you, I got you.

34
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,335
You good?

35
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,435
Let's do it.

36
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,874
Come on, Luther.
We got to behave ourselves tonight.

37
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:22,629
Motherfuckers is acting sensitive and shit.

38
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,518
Let's rock.

39
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:49,138
Get the fuck out the car.

40
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,706
Yo. Don't shoot.
- Aah. Aah.

41
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:52,807
Chill. Chill, man.

42
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:56,079
You know what the fuck this is.
Come about your shit.

43
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:58,179
All right.

44
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:03,487
Aah. No. Please don't.
Please don't.

45
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,222
Yo, give a nigga a heads-up next time.

46
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:08,382
Business is between those who do it.

47
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:16,393
Aah. Oh, no.
Please don't do it.

48
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:20,832
Don't do it.
Oh, my God. Ohh.

49
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,724
Take this, man.
Just don't shoot.

50
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,928
That's a real pretty necklace.

51
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,157
Where'd you get that from?

52
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:39,673
I bet you somebody real special-

53
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:41,558
Aah. Aah.

54
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh. Oh, my God.
Please don't kill me.

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,291
Oh, my God.
Please don't kill me.

56
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,034
Nigga...

57
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,411
Nigga, you fuckin' retarded, or what?.

58
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:02,980
What the fuck did I tell you?.

59
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,917
What the fuck, Sage?.
You said no one would get hurt.

60
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:10,078
Sage. Sage. Is that you?.

61
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:21,593
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I love you.

62
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,766
I'm so sorry.

63
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,204
Please.
- What you want me to do?

64
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,602
Please don't kill me. Aah.

65
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,441
Oh, no. Please don't do it.

66
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,567
Please don't kill me.
Oh, my God.

67
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:03,064
I'm not a rapper.

68
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,209
Though that perception
could be easily ascertained...

69
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,612
...from the outside, looking in.

70
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:10,314
I'm inclined to ask the question -...

71
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:13,819
...when I'm hungry and I make
myself something to eat,

72
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,114
does that make me a chef?

73
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,757
Or when I go to the playground
to shoot hoops,

74
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,159
does that make me a ballplayer?

75
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,318
I don't think so.

76
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,864
But for those into xicated
by these misconceptions...

77
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:28,800
...of who or what I am, I say to you...

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,969
...if you must define me...

79
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,836
...define me as a businessman,
a capitalist, a boss.

80
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:39,278
In a city of 9 million people,

81
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:44,338
where many see obstacles,
I see opportunities...

82
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,541
Like many other bosses,

83
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:50,178
has the ability to see 10 steps ahead,

84
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:52,257
figure out all the angles...

85
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,393
...and has the ungodly talent...

86
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:58,630
...of detecting, dissecting,
dismantling, dismissing...

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,533
...all potential problems and dangers...

88
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,758
...before it ever occurs.

89
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:07,906
When you're responsible for the livelihood...

90
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,841
...and welfare of others,

91
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:12,911
many times you're faced
with decisions and choices...

92
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:17,282
...the average soul can neither
comprehend nor condone.

93
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,851
But like the saying goes -...

94
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,255
...let your conscience be your guide.

95
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:25,722
And it's exactly that to which I abide.

96
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,161
So, as I struggle with my own demons...

97
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,564
...and try not to judge those who judge me,

98
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:37,227
I take comfort in knowing
one thing is undeniable -...

99
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,634
...everybody has a hustle.

100
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,808
What's yours?

101
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:02,177
Ah, yes, man. What you want?

102
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,792
I got all the mixtapes.
I got them.

103
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:08,195
I got the - the good movies
with the good quality, all new.

104
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,930
W- what you want?
You want CD or DVD?

105
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,598
You ain't got that superhead joint, right?

106
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,500
The superman?

107
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,000
No, man.
Never mind, yo.

108
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,404
Ah.

109
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,773
Yes, man.
That's my number-one seller.

110
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,209
I sold out of those last week.
I just got those.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:23,644
Sold them shits all out, huh?

112
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,612
All of them.
I give you for two for $10.

113
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,047
Being that you sold them all out, homey,

114
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:28,749
I guess I'm here to collect
what you owe me.

115
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,085
What you talking about, man?

116
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,320
Listen, I'm the one who's in charge
of selling these shits...

117
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,189
...to you smelly
motherfuckers out here, man.

118
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,757
And I know I didn't sell any to you, right?

119
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,194
So you must've copied these shits
on your own, dawg.

120
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,995
So why don't you just give me
what you owe me, man?

121
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:44,325
What you talking about, man?
You crazy.

122
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,633
A'ight, look, check this, right?

123
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,602
Since you seem to be doing
so well out here,

124
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,471
I'm gonna sell you more
for double the price, dawg,

125
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:50,705
'cause you fucked up.

126
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:52,941
But I like you, though,
so I'm willing to do you that favor.

127
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,809
I owe you nothing.
I don't want your business.

128
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,978
You get away from my table.
You get out of here.

129
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,414
And here I thought
you was a smart guy, Ziggy.

130
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:01,249
Now, you're a lucky man I got places to be,

131
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:02,617
or we'd have a real problem,
feel me?

132
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:03,685
Yo, when I come back, man,

133
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,487
I suggest you change
that attitude of yours, yo,

134
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,255
but for now,
I'm just gonna take my shit.

135
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:09,355
You take nothing. Ay.

136
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,799
Hey, yo, G, man,
I got places to be, yo.

137
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,279
Come on.
Let's beat out, man.

138
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,304
A'ight, man, listen, look,

139
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,572
when you're done, yo,
grab the CDs.

140
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:28,072
I'll be waiting for you in the car, man.

141
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,911
Some 'old skool' shit, man.

142
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,011
Nice.

143
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,042
What's going on, fellas?

144
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,044
Hi, Mr. Blanche. I'm raising money
for my basketball team,

145
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,580
and I want to know
if you want to make a donation.

146
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,515
Okay. How's your grades?

147
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:07,550
They're all right.

148
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,251
What about you?
- Sort of good.

149
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,020
Sort of good, huh?

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,421
A'ight, I'll tell you what.

151
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:15,391
You guys keep them grades up
and put me down for $100 each.

152
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:16,892
$100?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,561
All right.
- All right?

154
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,962
All right, y'all take it easy.

155
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:22,064
All right. Thank you.
- All right.

156
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:25,649
And don't ring the bell so early, either.

157
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:37,638
Thalia. Wake up.

158
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,315
What's up, baby?

159
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:45,187
What's up is you said you was
gonna clean this room today.

160
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,056
Hmm.

161
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,091
Come on, Cart. I'm tired.

162
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,989
I'll do it later when I wake up.

163
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,862
You said that yesterday, Thalia.

164
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:55,966
Just like you said
you was gonna do the kitchen.

165
00:10:56,066 --> 00:11:00,231
You still gonna hit the dishes up
at least, right?

166
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:04,774
Don't know why I bother with it.

167
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,874
Thalia.

168
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,178
Unh.

169
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:44,974
Ohh.

170
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,984
You awake now?

171
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,089
Uh-huh.

172
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,861
Good.

173
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:01,021
Get your ass up and clean the house.

174
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,816
Hey, I need you to go
into work for me today.

175
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,680
What?. Why?

176
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,087
It's Saturday.

177
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:26,324
I know what today is.
Bank got Saturday hours, right?

178
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:29,260
Yeah, the bank does,
but Thalia doesn't.

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,329
Yeah, well, Thalia does this Saturday.

180
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,898
I got some dough laying around.
I need you to take care of it.

181
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:37,738
I don't want it sitting till Monday, a'ight?

182
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:40,895
That's Max.
Put a robe on.

183
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,918
Yo, I'm telling you, man.

184
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,454
Everybody's amped
about your tournament this year.

185
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:57,888
All right. That's what's up, man.

186
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:01,092
That means we should have
an even better turnout this year.

187
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,461
Yo, you going to get Uglyman right now?

188
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:04,729
Yep. Going to get him.

189
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:06,497
Been seven years, man.
Long time.

190
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,332
Tell that dude to come holla at me, man.

191
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,662
I know his hairline is like back here.

192
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:14,523
I know how them jail niggas cut.

193
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:17,805
Put the money in the bag.

194
00:13:19,411 --> 00:13:22,642
Stop pouting, you big baby.

195
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,840
Fuck you.

196
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,507
Can you hold up for a sec?

197
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,686
Wait a second.

198
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,259
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

199
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,429
Just try to remember
I'm not one of your fucking friends.

200
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,064
Right.

201
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:41,164
Okay?

202
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,766
Okay.

203
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,244
Everything good, my dude?

204
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,578
Yeah, everything's cool, man.

205
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,614
Listen, you're shooting out
to Queens, right?

206
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:56,915
Yeah.

207
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:58,016
I need you to do me a favor...

208
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,885
...and drop me by my daughter's crib
in Rosedale.

209
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:01,119
She's mad at me, man.

210
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,219
Hey, we can't win, man.

211
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:05,321
No. Exactly.

212
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,350
Hey, yo, um...

213
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,430
Tell your man Douglas
I never got that receipt...

214
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,964
...for the cash I gave him.

215
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,232
Receipt?

216
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:17,402
Yeah, for the cash I gave him
for the tournament.

217
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:18,637
Cash?

218
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:20,238
Yeah, he said I had to give him cash...

219
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:23,739
'cause we were late getting him a check.

220
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,112
A'ight. I'll tell him.

221
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,510
A'ight. Cool.

222
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,558
You know, she really is mad at you.

223
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:34,821
Yeah, I know.

224
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,956
She gave me the Andrea attitude earlier.

225
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:39,325
I'm saying, what, do you make
her practice that or something?

226
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,794
'cause she's good at it already.

227
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:45,698
You are lucky that's all you got
some nights, Mr. Blanche.

228
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:48,634
Ask Al Green what a pot of hot grits
feels like, okay?

229
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,237
You got off with a nice cold shoulder.

230
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:52,872
Cold shoulder?

231
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,507
Andrea, I still get headaches...

232
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,143
...from you yapping in my ear
about what I need to do.

233
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,078
Like you didn't deserve it.

234
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,013
If I ever see you again with that no-good -

235
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:05,448
Now, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down, killer. Calm down.

236
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:07,920
Boy, you better stop playin'.

237
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,760
No, I know, I know.
I don't want no problems.

238
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,532
Hey.

239
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:20,800
You mad at Daddy?

240
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,202
Come on, you know
you can't stay mad at Daddy.

241
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,937
I told you I'll take you
to the American Girl store...

242
00:15:25,037 --> 00:15:26,005
...next weekend.

243
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,250
It'll be open on Saturday. I promise.

244
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,778
Hello.

245
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:32,946
Took you long enough.

246
00:15:33,046 --> 00:15:34,648
Shut up.

247
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,283
Hey.
- You love me now?

248
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:40,973
Yes, but I still want to go
to the American Girl store.

249
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,155
Behave.

250
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,628
Yeah, I'm going to pick up this dude
from upstate today.

251
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:49,663
You know what I mean?
Have him back on the streets.

252
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,832
Might throw a little something
for him tonight.

253
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:55,925
So, um, nah, basically,
it's all that, yeah.

254
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,871
It is what it is.

255
00:15:57,971 --> 00:15:59,971
A'ight. One.

256
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,678
Mr. Cart Blanche. My dude.
What's up, baby?

257
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:05,913
J.B. What's good, playa?

258
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,248
Yeah, you see what's good with me.

259
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:09,716
A'ight.

260
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:11,518
Yes, sir. Ooh.

261
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,618
Looking good.

262
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,654
Yo, baby.

263
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:17,457
So, that's it, huh?

264
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,192
Yes, sir.
- Okay, okay.

265
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,494
She's hot, man.

266
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,396
Yo, good looking out, man.

267
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:23,363
Your people hooked me up...

268
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:25,065
...with the VIN numbers and everything.

269
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:26,466
Cleaned the titles down south.

270
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,335
I ain't got to worry
about a goddamn thing, baby.

271
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:31,199
That's what's up.
- Yeah.

272
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,898
But, um...

273
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,042
I kind of wanted to talk to you...

274
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,577
...about the numbers and everything, man.

275
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,907
What did Dell tell you?

276
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:41,516
Come on, man.
You know I'm a baller on a budget.

277
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:43,718
Look, a-a'ight,
he called me a price, man.

278
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:45,653
It was kind of high,
but I thought I'd talk to you.

279
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:46,754
Man, we got history.

280
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:48,623
You know, we could
work something out, man.

281
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:49,958
Talk to Dell, man.

282
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:52,493
Come on, man. You used to fuck
with my sister, man.

283
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:54,562
Yo, man, we go back
like Whitney Houston and crack.

284
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,831
Baby, come on, man. It's me.
- Talk to Dell.

285
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,466
Yo, homey,
I'm talking right here, dawg.

286
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,802
Hey, hold up, man. I'm talking.

287
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:02,136
That's what it is, man.

288
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:03,938
What's up, man.
I'm glad to hear it, man.

289
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:05,640
A'ight, a'ight. Yeah.

290
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,975
You said you was gonna spit for him.

291
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,543
You got something for me, man?
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:12,043
Okay, okay.
- Yo, man, I spit miraculous.

293
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,557
Yo, yo.

294
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,959
Yo, what is this, man?

295
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,727
'Showtime at the Apollo' or somethin'?

296
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,562
Yo, I got one word for you, B.

297
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,198
'Chorus,' man. Got to learn
how to write a hook, B.

298
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,834
You ain't never gettin' signed like that, man.

299
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:07,269
Hey, you ready to go, boss, man?

300
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,504
Yeah, yeah, we good, man.

301
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:11,073
Fellas, fellas, man.
Sounds good, though, man.

302
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,474
Don't give it up, bro.

303
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:13,942
A'ight? Y'all stay up, man.

304
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,711
A'ight.

305
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,845
Yo, you a funny dude.

306
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,113
Dell, man.

307
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,782
Ah, damn, man.

308
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:20,916
You went above and beyond...

309
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,671
...when I told you to find a piece of shit.

310
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,050
Man. Shit all tight.

311
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,129
Yo, man, this shit remind me
of this whip I had...

312
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,798
...when I was in high school, man.

313
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,567
Yo, we used to call it 'P.O.S.'
stood for 'piece of shit.'

314
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,668
That's what we're gonna do.

315
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,168
We're gonna call this joint 'P.O.S. Jr.'

316
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:47,843
Yo, what the fuck is up
with this radio, man,

317
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,978
this Spanish 'Vida m ia' shit?

318
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:52,347
Where'd you get this car from -
Washington Heights?

319
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:56,017
Are we even gonna make it
up there in this?

320
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:57,553
What?

321
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:59,222
This is my mom's car.

322
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:00,990
It's your mo-

323
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,422
Yo, my bad, yo.

324
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:05,995
I mean, it gets her
from point 'A' to point 'B,' right?

325
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,135
That's all that matters.

326
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:13,670
Nigga, you know this car's
a piece of shit, dawg.

327
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,739
Yo, but how you gonna play
her car like that, though?

328
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,540
Yo, how you gonna
let your mom ride around...

329
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,942
...in some shit like this, man?

330
00:19:19,042 --> 00:19:20,610
Come on.
With all the paper we getting?

331
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,012
You got to have her in something
better than this, man.

332
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,747
Yo, you're a horrible son, man.

333
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,181
Can you pull off, please?

334
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:35,525
Hey, you really think I'm a horrible son?

335
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
Uh, yeah.

336
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,767
Yo, that shock-camp shit ain't no joke, man.

337
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,268
I'm telling you, yo.

338
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:47,437
Now that I think about it, man,
it might be worse...

339
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:49,806
...than going to the motherfucking
marines or something, yo.

340
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,776
All them poor cats want to be doing
is push-ups in the morning.

341
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,077
At shock camp, though,

342
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:55,945
you got a bunch of drug dealers
and crackheads...

343
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,647
...running around acting
like they're soldiers,

344
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,650
working out all the goddamn time, man.

345
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,952
Shit don't make no sense to me at all.

346
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,355
I didn't even work out
when I was in gym class, man,

347
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,455
let alone in there.

348
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,394
Yo, if it wasn't for them cuttin'
my 3-to-5 down to 6 months, Cart,

349
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:15,966
I'm telling you, man, I might have
dropped one of them C.O.'s, for real.

350
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:19,211
What is this,
a medium-security joint?

351
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,383
Big motherfuckin' Carter Blanche.
What up, baby?.

352
00:20:32,483 --> 00:20:35,203
Big Ug. What's the deal, player?

353
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:39,023
Goddamn, why y'all park
all the way down here, man?

354
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:40,658
Goddamn. What the fuck, player?

355
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:43,494
Thought I was gonna have to take
a cab down this motherfucker, man.

356
00:20:43,594 --> 00:20:44,261
Damn.

357
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,197
Same old Ug. Still complaining.

358
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:47,298
What's good, boy?

359
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,033
Ain't shit, man.
What up with you, man?

360
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,869
Nothin', man. I see that jailhouse
workout never fails, bro.

361
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,204
Get out of here with that shit.

362
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:55,039
You know a nigga like me
wasn't working out.

363
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:56,674
But you looking good yourself,
superstar.

364
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,076
Yo, Cart, the whole time I was up in here,

365
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,011
all I heard was niggas bumpin' your shit.

366
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:04,215
Yo, the buzz is crazy up here,
baby, for real.

367
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:07,251
I told you, man.
That's what it is, bro.

368
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,553
I'm glad to be out this motherfucker.

369
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:11,388
I ain't coming back to this bitch, for real.

370
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:12,556
I'm glad to hear that, man,

371
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:14,625
'cause I got a lot of shit
that needs to be done,

372
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,026
and I need you to be on point.

373
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,252
No doubt, baby. I'm here.

374
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:20,131
This is Dell. This is the cat
I was telling you about.

375
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:21,967
He's been holding me down
since you been gone.

376
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,134
What's good, man?

377
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,736
What's good, man?
I heard a lot about you, B.

378
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:26,071
It's good to finally meet you, man.

379
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,606
No doubt.

380
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:29,007
A'ight, let's get up out of here, man,

381
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:32,410
before they find a reason
to keep all three of us.

382
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,570
Yo, Cart.
What the fuck is this, man?

383
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:39,284
Yo, I know you can be-
Wait. Hold on. What's the word.

384
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:43,088
I know you can be frugal at times,
but what the fuck is this, B?

385
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:46,418
Somebody's been reading the Webster's.

386
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,127
I mean, yo,
look at the fucking bumper.

387
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:50,195
It got a band-aid on it.

388
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,964
What you want me to do, man?
Come up here in a Bentley?

389
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,866
Next thing you know,
we got all type of heat on us?

390
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:57,035
No, thanks, man.
You can have that.

391
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,203
No, man, I'm not saying that.

392
00:21:58,303 --> 00:22:00,071
I'm just saying I thought
I was gonna hit the streets...

393
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:02,507
...in some stylin' shit,
in some 'oh, shit' type shit.

394
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:03,975
What the fuck is this, man?

395
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,211
You got tape
all on the motherfucker - damn.

396
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,861
Yo, this is my mom's car, man.

397
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:10,615
Say word?

398
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:12,715
Yeah.

399
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:20,158
Yo, Cart, what the fuck
are you paying these cats, man?

400
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:21,059
Yo, what the fuck?

401
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,628
Is it like the Great Depression out here?

402
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,565
Well, fuck it. At least let me
whip this motherfucker.

403
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,434
No, man, I'm cool.
I'm gonna do the driving, yo.

404
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:30,202
Why don't you just sit in the back
and relax, man?

405
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:32,438
You just got out,
and we got a long ride.

406
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:34,307
Nigga, you act like
if I hit something in this shit,

407
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:36,676
you're gonna be able to tell.

408
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,945
It's like I said, man.
I usually do the driving, yo.

409
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:41,614
Come on, son.
Yo, I ain't drove in seven years.

410
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,749
That's exactly why your ass
is getting in the back,

411
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,484
so we can make it in one piece.

412
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,688
Y'all got plenty of time to argue
about who's driving, man. Let's go.

413
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:52,058
Yo, all I'm saying is this motherfucker
better not break down.

414
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:54,793
That's all the fuck I'm saying.

415
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:08,057
What the fuck is this, son?
Damn.

416
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,614
Hey, baby.

417
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:17,350
Hey, what up? What up?
- Welcome home.

418
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,851
Thank you. Thank you.
How are you?

419
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:19,852
Good, good.

420
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,120
Hey, yo, this is my man, El.

421
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,195
What's up?
What's good? How are you?

422
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:28,294
Yeah, this is what the fuck I'm talkin' about.

423
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:30,794
Yo, Ug.
Come here, man.

424
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:33,057
Yo, give me a minute.

425
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,312
What up, son?

426
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:47,412
Who the fuck is that?

427
00:23:47,747 --> 00:23:49,349
Oh, that's my man, El.

428
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,852
Yo, dawg, what,
you slip and bump your head?

429
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:54,755
You know how I feel about niggas
I don't know coming in my crib.

430
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:57,257
My fault, Cart. Yo, I didn't mean
no disrespect by this.

431
00:23:57,357 --> 00:23:59,493
Listen, yo, he just moved
down here from Rochester.

432
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:00,827
And, man, when we was locked up,

433
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:02,629
the nigga held me down,
kept the flies off me.

434
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,664
So I figured fuck it,
I'd bring him through to meet you.

435
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,166
I mean, shit - he been hearing about you...

436
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:08,666
...for the last seven years.

437
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:29,277
Porno mags, towels, all that shit.

438
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:31,414
My man, you playing?

439
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:32,259
Yeah.

440
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,862
So, you gonna put up or something?
What the fuck?

441
00:24:35,962 --> 00:24:37,731
And when we didn't have shit to play for,

442
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:38,932
we'd play for push-ups.

443
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:41,968
But the best shit was push-ups on demand.

444
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,336
That was the shit.

445
00:24:43,436 --> 00:24:46,040
On demand? What the fuck
is you talking about, man?

446
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,210
If you lose,
you got to give me my push-ups...

447
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,247
...whenever I want, wherever I want,
however many I want.

448
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:54,982
But we had to start
putting rules on that shit...

449
00:24:55,082 --> 00:24:56,617
'cause niggas was getting sent to the box...

450
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:58,653
...for doing push-ups on the mess-hall line.

451
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:00,388
Stupid motherfuckers.

452
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:01,823
That shit's crazy.

453
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:03,724
Yeah. We put on some real shit.

454
00:25:03,824 --> 00:25:06,194
Yo, my man, El, from Rochester,

455
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:08,162
that motherfucker owed me
like 20 push-ups.

456
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:10,231
Well, I stretched that shit out
over four years.

457
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:12,400
I'd see the nigga and be like,
'Yo, give me five push-ups.

458
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,368
No, no, matter of fact,
hold them last two till tomorrow.'

459
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:15,403
you know what I'm saying?

460
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:17,004
I made the nigga do a half a push-up.

461
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:18,906
You got to see that.
That's some funny shit.

462
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:22,533
Showtime. $150.
What you want to do?

463
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:24,312
And it wasn't just - you
know what I mean -...

464
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:26,214
...it ain't like we just did it with card games.

465
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:27,648
We was betting on sporting events.

466
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:31,085
Niggas was betting on hockey.
Didn't even fucking like hockey.

467
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:33,721
But the funniest shit
was during the football season.

468
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,089
Yo, you'd see mad motherfuckers...

469
00:25:35,189 --> 00:25:37,325
...in the yard the next morning,
Monday morning,

470
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:40,728
trying to get them push-ups
out in the fucking cold.

471
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,828
Shit was crazy.

472
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,490
Tell 'em, Dell.

473
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
You was sent up, right?

474
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,993
Wait. You did that boot-camp shit.

475
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:54,343
What was that, like three weeks?

476
00:25:54,443 --> 00:25:56,877
Nah. Try six months, dawg.

477
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:00,071
Oh, excuse me. Six months.

478
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:01,850
That's county time, dawg.

479
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,052
Shit. Call it what the fuck
you want, Uglyman.

480
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:06,188
At least I was home, dawg.

481
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:09,223
Oh, 'At least I was home.'

482
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,795
Yo, son, what the fuck is you doin', man?

483
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:15,564
You can't smoke in Cart's crib.

484
00:26:15,664 --> 00:26:17,766
'What the fuck is you doin'?
You can't smoke in Cart's crib.'

485
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,368
Don't worry about me, motherfucker.

486
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:23,123
Just worry about your little fucking cards.

487
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:35,579
Hey, baby, you want another drink?

488
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:36,818
Hello?
- What?

489
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:38,921
I'm about to go in the kitchen.
You want another drink?

490
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:41,021
All right. Yeah.

491
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,987
Let me get one, man.

492
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,763
Yo, are you trying to get me killed?.
What the fuck are you doing here?.

493
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,700
You got to be, like, the most obvious
FBl agent in the world.

494
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,435
You're gonna get us both killed.

495
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:27,535
Where you been, Thalia?

496
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,072
We haven't heard from you in a while.

497
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:31,975
I was starting to get
a little worried about you.

498
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:33,409
Yeah, well,
Carter's been very busy,

499
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,877
and I've been with him most of the time.

500
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:36,246
So, I mean, fuck,
it's been kind of hard...

501
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:37,347
...to get in contact with y'all.

502
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,848
Yeah, I know.
He's been very busy.

503
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,077
You got anything new?

504
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,589
Yeah, they got this basketball
tournament coming up,

505
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:47,790
and, I mean, they're gonna have...

506
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,158
...a whole bunch of new sponsors there.

507
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:50,627
So, I don't know, check that out.

508
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:54,697
Sponsors, huh? W-where did
they get these sponsors from?

509
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,797
Probably Douglas Beck.

510
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,163
Douglas Beck.

511
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:02,238
Yeah, he's like Cart's business consultant,

512
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:03,640
spokesperson, or some shit.

513
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,408
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

514
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,844
I just know that Cart and Dell
be talking about him all the time.

515
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,812
How come you haven't
mentioned him before?

516
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:13,246
I don't know.
I guess I fuckin' forgot.

517
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,286
Well, maybe I should forget
that in exchange...

518
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,888
...for not going to prison
for money laundering,

519
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:21,558
you're helping me with this investigation.

520
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:24,795
Do you know what the bank
that you work for would do...

521
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:27,363
...if they found out?

522
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,932
See what I'm saying?

523
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:36,740
Ohh.

524
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,511
Looks like they got
a nice big party going on in there.

525
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:43,414
Is there anything I should know about?

526
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,581
Ain't shit going on in there...

527
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,850
...but a bunch of drunk-ass niggas
talkin' shit.

528
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,019
So, if bullshit was a crime,

529
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,688
then, yeah, go lock them all up forever.

530
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:51,889
I don't give a fuck.

531
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:55,225
They're just throwing a party
for Cart's boy, Uglyman.

532
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:56,827
He just got out of jail.

533
00:28:56,927 --> 00:28:59,863
Oh, that must be, uh,
Thomas Robinson.

534
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,665
Damn. Y'all motherfuckers
know everything.

535
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:02,866
What you need me for?

536
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:05,769
Well, see, Thalia,
these are the things...

537
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,739
...we need to be kept informed about.

538
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,839
We have a deal.

539
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:15,379
Maybe I should put a wire on you.

540
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:20,155
Oh, hell, no. Where you gonna
put a wire in this outfit?

541
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:27,359
Y'all need anything to drink?

542
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,526
Nah, I'm good, man.

543
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:29,694
Nah.

544
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:33,662
No.
- I'm good, shorty.

545
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:37,463
Yo, Dell, give little man a tip.

546
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:39,635
I ain't got shit left.

547
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,507
Never mind, man.

548
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:45,007
Here you go, little man.

549
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:57,479
Sorry. I was talking to Lala.

550
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:03,695
A'ight, fellas.
Royal flush, motherfuckers.

551
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,663
Again, man?

552
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,823
Hate to keep doing it to y'all, man.

553
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,969
So, I'm saying, Ug,
what's gonna happen next?

554
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:14,873
I got to make y'all bet push-ups
being that I'm taking all your paper?

555
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:16,141
Fuck around, I'll have y'all...

556
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,877
...looking like full force
out this motherfucker.

557
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,678
Fuck.

558
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:23,782
I can't be playing
with these scrub-ass niggas, B.

559
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,617
Aw, nigga, stop complaining, man.

560
00:30:25,717 --> 00:30:30,178
You control your own game.
If you lose, it's on you.

561
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,179
And put that shit out in my house.

562
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,464
Man, what the fuck
is you laughing at, seat filler?

563
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:39,198
What you sayin'?

564
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,901
Nigga, you heard what the fuck I said.

565
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:44,503
Hey, yo, man. Yo, both y'all
sit y'all asses down, man.

566
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:45,471
What's the problem?

567
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:48,541
Niggas got million-dollar dreams
and dollar thoughts, man.

568
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,009
You over here talking about push-ups.

569
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,477
You talking about boot camp, man.

570
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:53,312
You need to be worried
about the next score.

571
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:54,814
You need to pull up y'all skirts...

572
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:57,616
...and stop acting
like a bunch of bitches, man.

573
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,518
Y'all arguing about who lost worse.

574
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,153
Y'all both suck equally, a'ight?

575
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:04,620
I got all the damn chips, man.
For real.

576
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:06,559
And you.

577
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,124
Don't fuck up my night, okay?

578
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:12,531
I'm saying, Cart,
we're just talkin' shit, you know?

579
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:14,500
That's what I'm saying, man.

580
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,085
And, you, let me get at you for a minute.

581
00:31:30,215 --> 00:31:32,618
Hey, yo, man, why you doin' that?

582
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:33,352
What?

583
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,287
'What'? Why you goin' at Dell like that?

584
00:31:35,387 --> 00:31:38,225
Aw, man, I'm just havin' some fun
with the little nigga,

585
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:39,493
testin' his nerve.

586
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:41,328
Being sure he is who he say he is.

587
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:44,828
He is. You know why?
'Cause I said he is.

588
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:45,999
I know how you feelin', man,

589
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:47,968
but I told you there's enough for everybody.

590
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,402
You need to leave that dumb shit alone.

591
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:51,502
Nigga, you home.

592
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:54,074
I mean, come on, Ug,
you need to calm down, man.

593
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:56,476
I need your head in the game.
Things are different out here now.

594
00:31:56,576 --> 00:32:00,013
You've been gone a long time.
Streets ain't gettin' no easier.

595
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:01,681
See, but that's what the fuck
I'm talking about,

596
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:02,849
'cause that's where we need to be.

597
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:05,886
I mean, what the fuck is this
'Cart the rapper' shit any fuckin' way?

598
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:08,321
Everybody in New York
want to be a fuckin' rapper.

599
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:11,652
Yo. You're not foolin' nobody, nigga.

600
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:13,660
You're a criminal just like the rest of us.

601
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,997
Man, fuck this B.E.T. Shit.
Let's do what we do best.

602
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,999
Let's get that motherfuckin' work,
hit the block,

603
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,767
and get that motherfuckin' money, man.

604
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,003
Yo, who the fuck you think
you're talking to, man?

605
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:25,906
Yo, Ug, the '90s is over.
Look around you.

606
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:29,242
Shit, nigga, look at me.
Dig in your pockets, man.

607
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,677
I put that money there.

608
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:32,512
How many niggas you know
could come home and say that?

609
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,180
Everybody talk about gettin' paper.

610
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,650
At the end of the day,
who's really gettin' it?

611
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,885
Go find them niggas
we was hustlin' with years ago...

612
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:40,387
...and see how many of them are starving.

613
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,487
I look hungry to you?

614
00:32:42,856 --> 00:32:44,291
Hey, yo, fuck this, man.

615
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:47,028
Yo, you want to continue eatin',
adjust, nigga.

616
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,128
Bottom line.

617
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,346
Yo, man, I want to say thank you
for sending Thalia up there...

618
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,681
...with that money and shit.

619
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:07,848
That was some real shit.

620
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:10,585
Those was the only visits a nigga got.

621
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:13,187
Yo, it's a small thing, man.
You know I would've if -

622
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,590
Nah, don't worry about it.
I know you would've if you could've.

623
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,291
I mean, I'm not even talking about you.

624
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,451
I'm talkin' about Lynn.
You seen her?

625
00:33:20,928 --> 00:33:23,230
Nah. Heard she moved out to Brooklyn.

626
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,060
Word. Brooklyn?
You know where?

627
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:29,136
You're not going to Brooklyn, man.

628
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,404
Leave that chick alone.

629
00:33:30,504 --> 00:33:31,672
Nah, man, I ain't gonna check her.

630
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:33,140
But I'm saying it has been seven years.

631
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,875
And that's a long time.
That's a lot of this.

632
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,877
Do you know how much of this
that is, nigga?

633
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:38,813
A'ight, man, I know
it's been seven years, man,

634
00:33:38,913 --> 00:33:40,181
but I got you covered, a'ight?

635
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,482
Oh, word?
- Come on.

636
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:42,883
Oh, shit.

637
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:47,828
Hey, Ug, still need to keep your head
in the game, a'ight?

638
00:33:48,689 --> 00:33:50,057
You like?

639
00:33:50,157 --> 00:33:53,615
Why, yes. I believe I do.

640
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:58,063
Ladies, this is my boy Ug.
He just came home.

641
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,170
I need y'all to do me a favor...

642
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,605
...and give him the proper
welcome home he deserves.

643
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,322
I can't keep talking my way...

644
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:23,325
...out of paying for unused studio time.

645
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:26,740
He's irresponsible,
and it's his career.

646
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:31,162
I know. I-I get it.
He won a Grammy.

647
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:34,403
But that was six freakin' years ago, Charles.

648
00:34:34,503 --> 00:34:36,503
What has he done since?

649
00:34:36,538 --> 00:34:38,802
An episode of 'Cribs'?

650
00:34:38,974 --> 00:34:41,949
Does he even still have that house?

651
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:44,944
Oh, he doesn't?

652
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:49,049
Wow. I-I was just kidding.

653
00:34:49,151 --> 00:34:52,382
Anyway, that's why I was saying...

654
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:55,057
...what I said in the marketing meeting.

655
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:57,259
I know it's blasphemy
to talk bad about him,

656
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,192
but I'm just so fed up.

657
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:01,430
I have to speak my mind.

658
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,558
And if I made you look bad, I'm sorry.

659
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:08,568
Yeah. Okay.

660
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:11,265
Great. Bye.

661
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:17,113
So, Charles wasn't happy
with your anti-20 Below statements?

662
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,704
Nope. Not one bit.

663
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:22,961
20 Below is the bane of my existence.

664
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:25,988
I understand,
but he ain't all that bad.

665
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:27,657
And he made this label
a good deal of money,

666
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:30,093
and Charles does have
a sense of loyalty, so....

667
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:31,961
Have you heard the new tracks
on his album?

668
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:33,229
No. Not yet.

669
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,627
Oh, my God. They suck.

670
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,968
I wouldn't download those songs for free.

671
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:40,503
Who is this?

672
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:42,603
Cart Blanche.

673
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:43,806
Cart Blanche, huh?

674
00:35:43,906 --> 00:35:45,906
Mm-hmm.

675
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,610
Ohh.

676
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,512
I would do him.

677
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:50,747
You're a whore.

678
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,515
Mm-hmm.

679
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:55,015
Oh, speaking of whores...

680
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:56,753
...that's why I'm here.

681
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:57,754
Can you take Sylvia...

682
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:59,455
...to Carson Daly's party tomorrow night?

683
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:00,490
I can't do it.

684
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,888
Yeah, I-I guess so.

685
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:05,128
You sure she won't feel like
she's slumming it with me?

686
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,229
I am the new guy.

687
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:08,698
No. She's oblivious to the world around her.

688
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:12,168
She only listens to her own music
and watches her own videos.

689
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:16,264
Hey, Monica, I've been
looking all over for you.

690
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,232
Oh, shit. This is Cart Blanche.

691
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,410
How do you know that?

692
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:24,114
You're kidding, right?

693
00:36:24,214 --> 00:36:27,251
He's only the hottest
underground rapper out.

694
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,553
Me and my friends have all of his mixtapes.

695
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:32,656
I like 'Run For Cover, Volume 3' the best.

696
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,966
I guess I stand corrected.

697
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,394
Cart Blanche is hot.

698
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,827
Hey, baby.
Where are you?

699
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:44,024
Oh, my God.

700
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:46,370
Not on the whore part, though.

701
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,040
Well, looks like we got
a match made in heaven.

702
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,210
You both love Cart Blanche.
You got a lot in common.

703
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,310
New best friends.

704
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,879
Okay. I'm starving.

705
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,074
Um, salad?

706
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:02,920
No, I got a ton of stuff to do.
I'll grab a PowerBar.

707
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,755
Oh, fine. Okay.

708
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,490
Cool. Thank you.

709
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,590
No prob.

710
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,580
Yo, Max, what's good?

711
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,815
Yo, I heard from Cart
that you ran into Lynn last week.

712
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,083
You got an address on her?

713
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,018
Yeah. Yeah.
Hold up. Let me get it.

714
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,313
A'ight. No doubt.

715
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,617
What's up?
Hey.

716
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,561
How're you?

717
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,896
I'm good. How are you?

718
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,829
I'm all right. I'm all right.

719
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
You look so different.

720
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,339
Shit, girl, I've been gone for a while,
you know what I mean?

721
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,276
Seven years, not to mention
I was locked up for a time.

722
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,178
It's been a minute
since you've seen me, you know?

723
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,488
It has. It's been a while.

724
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,670
So, you want to come inside,
have something to drink?

725
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:13,356
Cool.

726
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,991
Oh, shit.

727
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:58,502
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

728
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,710
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

729
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,190
Calm the fuck down, fat boy.

730
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,393
Where this nigga's pants at?

731
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,285
Y'all niggas don't know
who y'all fuckin' with.

732
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:17,210
Shut the fuck up.
Do what the fuck I told you.

733
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,972
Fat boy got some paper, huh?

734
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,029
Count it out, bitch.

735
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,000
Lynn, you know these motherfuckers?
You set me up.

736
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Shut the fuck up.

737
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,010
I'm just sayin', G.
Seven years, man?

738
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,712
Homey, I know niggas who did four, man.

739
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:43,450
They was thinking about fuckin'
one of them he/shes.

740
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,618
Seven years, dawg?
No, real shit, man.

741
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:48,955
Nigga got some head
from a nigga or somethin', B.

742
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,055
Hold on, man.

743
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,958
This motherfucker here.

744
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:55,895
Yo, Paulie.

745
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:58,298
Yo, you are the worst promoter
in the fuckin' world, man.

746
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,778
I swear to God, you suck, B.

747
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:02,969
No, I'm just fuckin' with you, yo.

748
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,170
Yeah, I got the contract.

749
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,940
I'm about to take that shit
over to Cart in a little while, man.

750
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,675
You get my list for tonight?

751
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:10,410
A'ight, cool, baby.
That's what it is, man.

752
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,655
We gonna shut that bitch down,
a'ight?

753
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:15,782
Yo, who this?

754
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:18,451
Hi. Um, this is Rachel Anderson
from Highway Records.

755
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,619
How are you?

756
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,988
Highway Records?
Cool. I'm good. What's up?

757
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,757
Good. Well, let me get right to it.

758
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,655
I am feelin' Cart Blanche.

759
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:29,429
That's what's up.
We aim to please.

760
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:30,797
I got this mixtape,

761
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:32,732
and, oh, I can't stop playing it.

762
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,335
I mean, I haven't heard
something I like this much...

763
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,569
...in quite a while.

764
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:39,973
Oh, Rachel. Rachel, right?
I bet you say that to all the boys.

765
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,674
Not even close.

766
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:44,511
Look, Dell, I want to set up
a meeting with Cart.

767
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,079
Do you think that'll be possible?

768
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,680
Honestly, ma, we ain't really lookin'

769
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,984
to go the major-league route
these days at all, man.

770
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,719
We actually like to make money.

771
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:54,021
Call me crazy, but, uh,
we like it in the streets, man.

772
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,256
Shit's been good to us.

773
00:40:55,356 --> 00:40:56,290
Fair enough.

774
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,593
All I'm asking is a chance to meet Cart...

775
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:02,897
...and let you know that we do it
a bit differently here at Highway.

776
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:05,462
Our deals are artist-centric.

777
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,769
So, when do you think we could meet?

778
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,505
Cart's schedule's mad booked, ma.
I don't know.

779
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,165
All I need is 10 minutes.

780
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:17,578
10 minutes, huh?
All right, we'll fuckin' check it out.

781
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,246
You said you feelin' the mixtape, right?

782
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:20,047
Yeah, yeah.

783
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,849
All right, then, well,
if you're feelin' the mixtape,

784
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,350
then the stage show will blow your mind.

785
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,252
You should come down.
It's at the pavilion tonight.

786
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,721
If you really want him,
we can chop it up there.

787
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,490
Cool. You got it.

788
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,891
Um...

789
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:33,323
Ohh. Shoot.

790
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:35,029
I can't. I...

791
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,897
I have to take one of my artists to a party.

792
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,766
That's a'ight. It's cool.
You can bring them, too.

793
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:42,069
If you really want to chop it up,
we gonna be at the show.

794
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,037
A'ight, cool, Rach.

795
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:44,972
So, I'm-a put you on the list,
plus three, a'ight?

796
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,040
Um...

797
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,140
A'ight. One.

798
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:55,382
Hey, Douglas.
Thought you got lost again.

799
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:58,285
No, I had to stop and put air in my tires.

800
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:01,556
Again? Don't you think it's time
you get a new tire?

801
00:42:01,656 --> 00:42:03,988
I will. I will.

802
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:06,117
Come on in.

803
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:18,406
My wife will kill me if she finds out I ate this.

804
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:21,042
I'm sure something or someone
will beat her to that.

805
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:23,906
You're probably right.

806
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:25,780
So damn good.

807
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,850
Who knew mystery meat could be so tasty?

808
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,585
Hate to burst your bubble, bro.

809
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:33,021
Ain't no mystery to that meat.
That's turkey.

810
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:34,890
We don't do swine in this house.

811
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,224
No.

812
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:38,894
Why'd you have to ruin that for me?

813
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:40,994
Just plain mean.

814
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:51,840
Oh, nice phone.
When'd you get all 21st century?

815
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,508
Mm, my brother got it for me.

816
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:56,311
All the associates at his firm have them.

817
00:42:56,411 --> 00:43:00,615
He thought it would help me
remember my appointments better.

818
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:02,484
But I'll tell you something, Carter,

819
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:06,579
I never missed an appointment
I wanted to go to.

820
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,992
Well, the good thing,
I can get sports scores on that.

821
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:13,152
Church will never be the same again.

822
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:17,466
A'ight. Everything looks good here.

823
00:43:17,566 --> 00:43:18,834
What else you got for me?

824
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:19,936
Okay.

825
00:43:20,036 --> 00:43:25,051
We're getting you out of Disney,
Syrex, and Tandem Health...

826
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:29,443
...and into Somaxon, Sharpe,
and Pfizer.

827
00:43:29,545 --> 00:43:32,748
You're going extra hard on Sharpe, right?

828
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:34,817
Yeah.
You said that's the one, right?

829
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:36,917
Let's run with it.

830
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:40,022
All right, so, if that's it....

831
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:41,424
All right.

832
00:43:41,524 --> 00:43:43,693
Not to say that your conversation
isn't stimulating,

833
00:43:43,793 --> 00:43:46,343
but, uh, I got an appointment.

834
00:43:47,763 --> 00:43:49,465
The Battery Park restaurant?

835
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:50,633
Yes.

836
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,894
Do you want me in on it?

837
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:54,770
Uh, no. That's all right.

838
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,406
But I do need you to send a check
over to Jackie at Land Rover.

839
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,676
I want to get a new Range Rover
for the winter.

840
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:04,041
Done and... done.

841
00:44:04,146 --> 00:44:05,348
Oh, speaking of checks,

842
00:44:05,448 --> 00:44:08,117
did you ever get that check from Max...

843
00:44:08,217 --> 00:44:11,022
...for the basketball tournament?

844
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:12,455
Max?

845
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:14,555
Yeah, the barber.

846
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:17,225
Oh, yeah.

847
00:44:17,861 --> 00:44:19,296
I did. He, uh, mailed me a check.

848
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,776
I... I got it the other day.

849
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:25,736
And the, uh, tournament info -
that's here, right?

850
00:44:25,836 --> 00:44:27,571
I think so.

851
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:29,671
Okay.

852
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,608
Oh, Douglas...

853
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,414
I don't see it.

854
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:50,394
Mm. Here it is.

855
00:44:50,494 --> 00:44:52,996
I, uh... grabbed it by mistake.

856
00:44:53,096 --> 00:44:55,656
Okay. No problem.

857
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:59,202
A'ight, um...

858
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:02,072
I guess I'll talk to you a little later.

859
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:02,806
Oh.

860
00:45:02,906 --> 00:45:04,274
You get that tire fixed.

861
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:07,639
Oh. I will. I will.

862
00:45:34,038 --> 00:45:36,302
What's shakin', Dougie?

863
00:45:37,842 --> 00:45:39,010
Ohh.

864
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,136
Well, either it's you,

865
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:45,783
or that delicious turkey dog
I just ate is giving me gas.

866
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:47,418
A turkey dog, huh?

867
00:45:47,518 --> 00:45:50,488
You're not getting health-conscious
on me, now, are you, Douglas?

868
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:53,324
I was tricked into eating it,
thank you very much.

869
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:56,461
And a hot dog made out of turkey
just ain't right.

870
00:45:56,561 --> 00:45:59,029
Mm.

871
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,223
It was tasty, though.

872
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:03,332
Yeah, I bet.

873
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:05,334
So, what's new?

874
00:46:10,341 --> 00:46:12,543
Just go to the camera feature.

875
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:14,746
This button right here?
- Yeah.

876
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:18,246
Cart doesn't say much, though.
Good luck.

877
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,919
It's not always what they say,
Douglas.

878
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:24,019
Ah.

879
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,289
Mm.

880
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:32,163
So, when are you gonna be
finished with this job?

881
00:46:32,263 --> 00:46:36,259
It's only a matter of time
before he's on to me.

882
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:38,704
You're not afraid of getting caught...

883
00:46:38,804 --> 00:46:42,969
...with your hand in the cookie jar,
now, are you?

884
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,369
Douglas...

885
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,643
You got to get some Tums
or something. Really.

886
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,809
It's not very appealing.

887
00:46:58,323 --> 00:47:00,958
You need some air in that tire.

888
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:08,398
Asshole.

889
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,206
Damn, nigga.
What the fuck happened to you?

890
00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:15,607
What the fuck it look like?

891
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,210
Well, it look like your ass
was playin' some jail-rules football.

892
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,545
Yeah, you real funny.

893
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:21,146
Now I know why Cart fuck with you.

894
00:47:21,246 --> 00:47:24,731
Every king need a jester.
Clown-ass nigga.

895
00:47:25,984 --> 00:47:29,121
Damn. Yo, what the fuck happened to you?

896
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,823
What the fuck?.
Everybody got jokes?.

897
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:32,591
Hey, yo, Ug, come here, man.

898
00:47:32,691 --> 00:47:34,731
Get the fuck out my way.

899
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:41,500
Hey, Kenneth.
How are you, sweetie?

900
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,796
Crazy day.

901
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:46,708
You gonna be ready to go by 7:00?

902
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,875
Damn it.

903
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,911
What?

904
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:55,836
Kenneth, I totally forgot
about the screening.

905
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:57,417
What do you mean you forgot?

906
00:47:57,517 --> 00:48:00,917
I have to do something for work tonight.

907
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,991
There's just been so much going on,
and I guess I...

908
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,218
I forgot.

909
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,658
You forgot.

910
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,698
Man, you got to be kiddin' me.

911
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:14,767
I'm sorry. I know.

912
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,596
What is it you have to do?

913
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,341
Remember that hip-hop artist
I said I wanted to sign?

914
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,775
No.

915
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,245
You know, the mixtape that I made for you.

916
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:27,575
That fuckin' rapper?

917
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:32,886
You know, you don't have to be so rude,

918
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:35,921
but, yes, the rapper.

919
00:48:36,022 --> 00:48:40,326
So, I'm supposed to be meeting him
after his show tonight.

920
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:44,130
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get these tickets?

921
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,366
I know, baby, but it's really-

922
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,434
You know - you know what?
No, no, no. Whatever.

923
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,469
Bye.

924
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:51,730
Kenneth, wait.

925
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,439
Ha ha. New York City, man.
Talk to me.

926
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:27,942
Y'all ready for the king of New York, baby?

927
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:30,844
The king of paper chasin',
Mr. Carter Blanche.

928
00:49:30,944 --> 00:49:32,944
Let's get it.

929
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:35,947
1, 2.

930
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:49,856
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

931
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:52,024
Whoa. Where you goin'?

932
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,695
Oh, I have a meeting with Dell.

933
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:54,863
Who are you?

934
00:50:54,963 --> 00:50:56,698
Rachel from Highway Records.

935
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:57,632
Who?

936
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:00,769
Rachel from Highway Records.
He's expecting me.

937
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:03,360
Hi. And I'm Sylvia.

938
00:51:04,572 --> 00:51:06,836
Hold on a second.

939
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:09,477
Yo, Dell.

940
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:12,782
There's a Rachel from Freeway -
Expressway Records?

941
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:13,716
Oh, Rachel from Highway.

942
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:15,117
Yeah, she's cool.
You can send her up, man.

943
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:16,085
You sure?
- Yeah, no doubt.

944
00:51:16,185 --> 00:51:18,185
All right.

945
00:51:20,189 --> 00:51:22,555
All right. Go ahead.

946
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:27,129
Dell?
- Rachel?

947
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:29,779
Yeah. Hi. So nice to meet you.

948
00:51:29,865 --> 00:51:31,534
The show was off the hook.

949
00:51:31,634 --> 00:51:33,736
Thank you.
I told you we aim to please.

950
00:51:33,836 --> 00:51:36,238
Dell, this is Sylvia and Greg.

951
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:37,873
Dell is Cart's manager.

952
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,443
Sylvia, huh?
My ex has all of your records.

953
00:51:40,543 --> 00:51:43,646
Your last album was platinum in her Honda.

954
00:51:43,746 --> 00:51:46,749
Well, thank you.
Nice to meet you, Dell.

955
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:51,081
So, Dell,
can you introduce me to Cart?

956
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:55,685
Yeah. Come on.

957
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:01,797
Hey, yo, Cart.

958
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:04,734
This is Rachel, the shorty
from Highway I was tellin' you about?

959
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:06,268
Dell, what the fuck you doin', man?

960
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:08,368
These chicks fuckin'?

961
00:52:11,106 --> 00:52:13,275
No, I'm just kiddin'.
Nice to meet you.

962
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:16,078
Wow, I finally get to meet
the legendary Cart Blanche.

963
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,480
It's a pleasure.

964
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,381
I don't know about the legend part, ma,

965
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:22,185
but, uh, the pleasure's definitely mine.

966
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:25,322
Oh, um, Cart,
this is one of my artists.

967
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:26,256
This is Sylvia.

968
00:52:26,356 --> 00:52:27,557
How you doin'?

969
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:31,194
You killed it out there.
Your stage show - hot.

970
00:52:31,294 --> 00:52:33,764
I might have to steal some of that for mine.

971
00:52:33,864 --> 00:52:35,065
Oh, yeah?

972
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:37,701
Well, money talks.
For a small fee, we can discuss.

973
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,770
So, I was hoping
that we could grab a second,

974
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,971
and I could talk to you...

975
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:43,373
...about what I think we can do
for you at Highway.

976
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:46,009
Highway? What y'all need me for?

977
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:48,478
You got 20 Below holdin' y'all down.

978
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:50,578
Are you serious?

979
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:52,983
No, I'm not.

980
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,381
Oh. You scared me.

981
00:52:55,485 --> 00:52:58,455
Oh, you're not even gonna defend
your own artist?

982
00:52:58,555 --> 00:52:59,823
Not that one.

983
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:00,924
Look, everybody knows...

984
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:02,959
...that we have the hottest roster
in the industry.

985
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,462
We... just have one bad apple.

986
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:07,330
Look, you want a drink?

987
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,765
You guys want a drink?

988
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:11,026
Let's all have a drink.

989
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:19,776
I have all of your mixtapes and albums.

990
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:21,678
I absolutely love them.

991
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,076
Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

992
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,750
Well, my niece has all of yours.

993
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,620
Her mother won't let her watch
that last video, though.

994
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,930
Too much ass shaking, huh?

995
00:53:34,492 --> 00:53:37,518
So, Rachel, were you from, ma?

996
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,766
I think what really gets me about you...

997
00:53:41,866 --> 00:53:45,266
...is that your lyrics are so cinematic.

998
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:48,873
It's like I can see everything
you're talkin' about in color.

999
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:51,464
Like a movie.

1000
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,870
What's your favorite movie?

1001
00:53:53,945 --> 00:53:55,945
Guess.

1002
00:53:56,447 --> 00:53:58,783
What do I get if I get it right?

1003
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:01,603
Get it right, and I'll tell you.

1004
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,789
Everybody signed it but Cube.

1005
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:07,859
He was the only one
who had a lawyer look at it.

1006
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:10,934
Next thing you know,
Cube went solo.

1007
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,364
Wow. Very impressive.

1008
00:54:13,464 --> 00:54:15,600
The lady does know her hip-hop.

1009
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,895
It's my life.

1010
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:25,470
So, Rachel, you want
to come by my house tomorrow?

1011
00:54:27,011 --> 00:54:27,912
Mm...

1012
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:30,139
I'll have to say...

1013
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:32,247
'The Godfather.'

1014
00:54:32,817 --> 00:54:34,817
Wow. Not bad.

1015
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:37,965
What? Are you serious?
I got it right?

1016
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:41,693
You remind me of Al Pacino's character.

1017
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:43,028
Michael Corleone.

1018
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:45,763
I haven't seen that in so long.

1019
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:53,405
Oh, really?

1020
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:55,908
I was just watching it
on the way over here in the van.

1021
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,809
Really?

1022
00:54:57,909 --> 00:54:59,144
Hmm.

1023
00:54:59,244 --> 00:55:01,405
We should go watch it...

1024
00:55:02,481 --> 00:55:05,678
Like, right now.

1025
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:10,289
So, what are you doing tomorrow?

1026
00:55:10,389 --> 00:55:14,384
You should just come by
the studio or something.

1027
00:55:23,335 --> 00:55:25,462
Come on.

1028
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:50,120
Why are you so quiet?

1029
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,130
Rat got your tongue?

1030
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:56,167
You're too funny.

1031
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,902
I'm not feelin' this.

1032
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:03,476
I don't want to do this anymore.

1033
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:05,244
You don't want to do this anymore?

1034
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:07,809
Are you in love or something?

1035
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:11,162
You don't want to see your man go down?

1036
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:14,337
Nobody made you do this, Thalia.

1037
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:17,621
You did.

1038
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,456
How? By offering you money?

1039
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:24,998
That wasn't by force.
I offered, you accepted.

1040
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:27,100
It was as simple as that.

1041
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,068
Just like I offered you jail or freedom.

1042
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,805
Just like coming to this hotel.

1043
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,404
You always have a choice.

1044
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:40,171
Well, maybe I changed my mind.

1045
00:56:41,581 --> 00:56:43,581
Yeah?

1046
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,245
That's totally up to you.

1047
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:49,667
I'll take you in right now if you want.

1048
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,992
What I thought.

1049
00:56:55,261 --> 00:56:59,633
I don't know. I swear,
I feel like Cart knows, and....

1050
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:02,623
It just scares the shit out of me.

1051
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,639
That's just your conscience.

1052
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:10,618
You got to beat that back.

1053
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:16,727
'Cause there ain't no room
for conscience in this situation.

1054
00:57:18,218 --> 00:57:21,155
Why don't you help me
get rid of my conscience?

1055
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:23,621
I thought I just did.

1056
00:57:23,724 --> 00:57:26,193
Don't flatter yourself, white boy.

1057
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:28,796
I'm talking about my bank account.

1058
00:57:28,896 --> 00:57:32,764
I'm gonna need, you know,
more security...

1059
00:57:32,933 --> 00:57:35,653
...in case this shit goes wrong.

1060
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:40,640
I love the way you negotiate.

1061
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:50,989
I will take care of you.

1062
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:53,520
And you won't ever have to worry...

1063
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,785
...about your conscience
getting in the way again.

1064
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,369
Oh.

1065
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:10,630
By the way...

1066
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:14,105
...this little meeting we had here...

1067
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:16,419
...doesn't change a thing.

1068
00:58:17,378 --> 00:58:20,347
So what do you got for me?

1069
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:35,428
Here.

1070
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,900
I just wrote down any names
I overheard them discussing.

1071
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,655
I don't even know
who half these people are.
