00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:08,264
(audience applauds)

4
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,688
- [Pianist] Thank you,
thank you very much.

5
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:16,109
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,895
(speaks French)

7
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:21,046
I can't, I couldn't possibly.

8
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:22,988
There you go, thank you,
okay, just one more.

9
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,398
Just one more.

10
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:26,558
I'm glad you liked it, there you go.

11
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:28,217
Thank you, thank you,
this is the last one.

12
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,967
No, I can't, thank you very much.

13
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,588
- Your encore was beautiful.

14
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:37,588
- Thank you.

15
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,609
Would you like me sign that?

16
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,859
- No, no, I don't think so.

17
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:48,923
- Well, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to imply that, um...

18
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:50,768
Well.

19
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,565
Goodnight.

20
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:54,398
- Alan?

21
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,255
- Liana?

22
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,477
It is you!

23
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:02,495
- Yes, yes it's me!

24
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:03,328
- Hi!
- Hi!

25
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,864
I heard you were in town
and I had to hear you play.

26
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:10,157
Oh, it was beautiful, breathtaking.

27
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,757
- [Alan] Thank you.

28
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:12,938
How are you?

29
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,355
- Well, I'm well.

30
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,949
Do you know it's been 10 years?

31
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,467
- God. (chuckles)

32
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,247
- So, are you still living in France?

33
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:21,080
- I am.

34
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:25,607
(Liana chuckles)

35
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,024
Look, I've got a little time.

36
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:33,578
Would you like to get a
cup of coffee or a drink?

37
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:34,566
- Sure!

38
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:35,978
Sure.

39
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:38,477
I know a place just down the street.

40
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,599
They have great cappuccino.

41
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,629
But if you'd rather go for a drink--

42
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,962
- No, coffee, coffee's fine.

43
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,042
Well, hop in.

44
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,818
- But it's just down the street.

45
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,629
- This is LA, you're not
supposed to walk in LA.

46
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,439
You're supposed to drive
everywhere, aren't you?

47
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,272
- Alan.

48
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:55,048
- What, you don't wanna
go for a ride with me?

49
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,339
- No, I can't get in
there to go half a block.

50
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,147
You haven't changed at all.

51
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,379
- Actually, I have.

52
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,129
- Really?
- I'm older.

53
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,357
- You're also married.

54
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:08,440
- Yes, well actually, no.

55
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:10,444
I was married.

56
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,208
- Then what's the ring for?

57
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,118
Oh no, I'm being nosy.

58
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,285
- That's okay.

59
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,757
What about you?

60
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:22,587
- His name is George.

61
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:26,555
(Alan speaks French)
(Liana chuckles)

62
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:30,722
(Liana speaks French)
(Alan chuckles)

63
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,540
- Do you remember when
I beat you at juries?

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,551
- No.

65
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,779
- Oh, come on.
- Nobody ever beat me.

66
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,769
Shh, shh, shh, keep it down.

67
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:44,009
How could I forget?

68
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,740
- Okay, here's your latte,

69
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,990
and here's your cappuccino.

70
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,128
Can I get you anything else?

71
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,340
- No, I'm fine.

72
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,923
- Thank you.
- Okay.

73
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,660
- You're always so competitive.

74
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,493
- Me?

75
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:02,325
- Yes, you.

76
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:06,812
- I was not half as competitive as you.

77
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:09,645
And you've made it, you're a star.

78
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,151
- No, I don't know about that.

79
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:13,984
- You are.

80
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,324
You're terrific.

81
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,172
- How about you?

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,817
- I'm fine.

83
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,380
Maybe a little bored.

84
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm not a famous concert pianist.

85
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,170
- But what do you do?

86
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,742
- Well...

87
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,359
- [Alan] Well, what?

88
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,304
- I have a husband.

89
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:42,984
- So?

90
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,870
But what about your music?

91
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,641
- I play piano at home.

92
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,641
- But what about your music?

93
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,391
- Don't be obnoxious.

94
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:55,525
- Sorry.

95
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,430
Did we ever like each other?

96
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,740
- (chuckles) I don't know.

97
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,852
You were such a monster.
- Me? (laughs)

98
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:06,769
- Yes, you.

99
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,812
You were always on my case.

100
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,583
I always had to watch out for you.

101
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,570
- I thought you were admiring my body.

102
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,343
- Oh, spare me.
(Alan chuckles)

103
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:21,760
So, that's why you kissed me.

104
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:23,940
- I kissed you?

105
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,971
- Yes.

106
00:06:24,971 --> 00:06:28,121
- I don't remember that.
- Oh, Alan, please!

107
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,538
- Oh, I remember.

108
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,449
Right before graduation.
- In Washington Square.

109
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,737
- Under the bridge.
- In late spring.

110
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:37,438
- I caught a cold.
- You did not.

111
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,307
- I almost died.
- You're a liar.

112
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,747
- And you look great.

113
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:41,664
- I do not.

114
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:46,968
Thank you.

115
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,139
- Why did you stop playing?

116
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,183
- I play.

117
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,678
- Not seriously, not with those nails.

118
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:05,678
- Yes, I do.

119
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,089
You know, I would have
thought that maybe by now,

120
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:12,647
you would have changed just a little bit.

121
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,647
You're still, kind of...

122
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,249
- A jerk.

123
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,082
- Yes.

124
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:21,452
No.

125
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,319
You're commanding.

126
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:30,605
It works for you on stage,
you're very commanding on stage.

127
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:33,925
Off stage, it gets tiring.

128
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:36,290
- I know.

129
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:38,889
It's a show, Liana.

130
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,030
Underneath it all, I'm
really a regular guy.

131
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,859
- Who loves motorcycles.

132
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:46,867
A Harley-Davidson, wasn't it?

133
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,395
- You remember that?

134
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:51,707
- There's still a certain
charm to the image.

135
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:53,957
(chuckles)

136
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:58,569
It's good seeing you again, Alan.

137
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,902
- It's good seeing you, too.

138
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:07,964
I've often wondered what became of you.

139
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,115
- Really?

140
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:13,965
- Really.

141
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:23,481
I'd like to see you again, before I leave.

142
00:08:24,943 --> 00:08:26,026
Lunch, maybe.

143
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,434
- How about my place?

144
00:08:31,434 --> 00:08:32,767
- I'd like that.

145
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:38,136
Well...

146
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,051
(sighs)

147
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,554
Am I gonna meet your husband?

148
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,183
- Who, George?

149
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,266
- You have more than one?

150
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:55,319
We haven't even talked about him.

151
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,189
- I know.

152
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:58,320
- I'd like to meet him.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,608
- Maybe you will.
- What're you doing?

154
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,191
- This is my treat.

155
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:04,761
- Okay.

156
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:08,837
Can I give you a lift?

157
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:12,387
- This is America, Alan, I have a car.

158
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:13,554
I'll call you.

159
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,575
(door bell rings)

160
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:52,470
(knocks)

161
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,303
(door bell rings)

162
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:02,373
(sighs)

163
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:09,517
(knocks)

164
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,966
(sighs)

165
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,028
Hi!
- (chuckles) Hi.

166
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:20,861
Come in!

167
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:25,148
- I brought these for you and George.

168
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,736
- Oh, they're beautiful.

169
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:28,569
Thank you.

170
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,428
George won't be here.

171
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,638
- Oh, that's too bad, I was
looking forward to meeting him.

172
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,988
- Well, maybe next time.

173
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:37,821
Well.

174
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,169
- [Alan] Hey.

175
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:49,188
(high-pitched piano notes)

176
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,558
(Liana chuckles)

177
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,308
- Well, let's go eat.

178
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,166
- Wow!

179
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,398
- I hope it will do.

180
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,648
- Do? It's a, it's a feast!

181
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:07,577
- Are you hungry?
(Alan laughs)

182
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:09,494
- Mm-hm!
- That's a yes.

183
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:15,198
It's a beautiful day, let's eat outside.

184
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:18,865
(peaceful orchestral music)

185
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:36,519
- Mind if I play?

186
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,436
- I'd be honored.
(Alan laughs)

187
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,203
- Here.

188
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,407
("Waltz in A Flat" by Johannes Brahms)

189
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:31,462
- That was nice.

190
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,624
- I love Brahms.

191
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:42,662
One of Catherine's favorites, too.

192
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,391
- Who's Catherine?

193
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:48,622
- My wife.

194
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:51,951
- Oh.

195
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,621
- She died three years ago.

196
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,221
- I'm sorry.

197
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:10,389
- (sighs) You play something.

198
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,351
What's the matter?

199
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,911
- I...

200
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,744
- Liana?

201
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,618
- I can't.
- Why not?

202
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,969
- I don't know, Alan, please.

203
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,226
- What's wrong?

204
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:25,309
(footsteps approach)

205
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,383
- George.

206
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:43,391
My husband, George.

207
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,058
(Alan chuckles)

208
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:51,511
George, this is Alan Spencer,
my friend from Juilliard.

209
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:55,111
- I understand you're doing
quite well for yourself.

210
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,430
George Buckman, good to meet you.

211
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,661
- Alan Spencer.

212
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,711
- May I talk to you a minute?

213
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,628
In private?

214
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:06,253
- Now is not the time.

215
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:10,071
- Well, I think we
should make it the time.

216
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,571
With Mr. Spencer's permission.

217
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:17,399
- Uh, well, I'm late as it is.

218
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,066
I've gotta go, um...

219
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,442
It was a wonderful lunch.

220
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,671
And I'll see you tomorrow.

221
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,588
- Tomorrow?

222
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,871
- Tomorrow?

223
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:34,770
What are you doing tomorrow?

224
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,937
- We're going on a picnic.

225
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:39,938
- A picnic.

226
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:42,618
- A picnic.

227
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,351
- So, I'll pick you up at 11, huh?

228
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:50,184
Bye.
- Bye.

229
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,073
- Nice meeting you.

230
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:55,250
- Mm-hm.

231
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,317
I don't like him.

232
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,919
I said, I don't like him.

233
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,631
- I heard you.

234
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,159
Why are you here, George?

235
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,730
- To get the rest of my stuff
and to leave you the keys.

236
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,911
- And to spy on me?

237
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:23,970
- No, but I didn't expect this.

238
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,751
- What are you concerned about, a scandal?

239
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:29,220
- We're not divorced yet.

240
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,802
They might ask me to run again.

241
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,219
- Get your stuff and get out.

242
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:46,300
- Look, can't you understand
my position in this?

243
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,300
- How dare you walk in on me.

244
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,874
- You and your friend
didn't hear me knock,

245
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:54,124
because of that damn piano!

246
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,042
- It's nice to hear it played again.

247
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,471
- Oh sure, especially
by your pal, Liberace.

248
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:01,638
- Oh, stop it.

249
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,590
My friends are my business now,

250
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,802
and don't start with the piano.

251
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,882
- I'm not!
- You are!

252
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:12,132
You hate that piano, you always have.

253
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,842
And you hated me when I used to play.

254
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,509
- I never stopped you from playing.

255
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:17,310
- Oh, yes you did.

256
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,435
You made it very clear.

257
00:18:19,435 --> 00:18:23,500
Every time I played for
anyone, it led to a fight.

258
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,917
- You only did it to hurt me!

259
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,727
- George, that's not true.

260
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,049
I tried to be good to you.

261
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,908
- Well, maybe you just
didn't try hard enough.

262
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,558
- Maybe I just got tired of being

263
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:40,768
window dressing to your career.

264
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:45,009
- Politics demands
sacrifices, you know that.

265
00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:47,748
- I made sacrifices, George.

266
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:49,748
I gave up a lot for you.

267
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:52,591
My music.

268
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,460
Everything.

269
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,377
(melancholic orchestral music)

270
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,220
- I gotta go, I've got a
meeting in the morning.

271
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
- George, before you go.

272
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,228
- Oh no, you keep it.

273
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:18,395
- No, it was your grandmother's,
it belongs in your family.

274
00:19:20,278 --> 00:19:23,195
- And I thought you belonged to me.

275
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,049
For better or for worse?

276
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,867
- George, that's not fair.

277
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:33,380
Do you want the divorce or not?

278
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,867
- Enjoy your picnic.

279
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,697
I'm sure he will.

280
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:30,219
("Piano Sonata No. 11" by
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)

281
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,598
(jurists applaud)

282
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,076
(restrained piano music)

283
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,063
(motorcycle engine purrs)

284
00:22:20,638 --> 00:22:24,305
(peaceful orchestral music)

285
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,208
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it.

286
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,099
They're outrageously expensive in France.

287
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,179
I thought I'd ship it over.

288
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:34,262
Get on, you're wasting time, come on!

289
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,832
You ready?
- Yeah.

290
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,751
(upbeat pop music)

291
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:08,789
(peaceful electronic music)

292
00:23:46,934 --> 00:23:49,601
- That rock's a little slippery.

293
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:55,996
No, no!
(Liana yelps)

294
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,892
(Liana chuckles)

295
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:14,156
- Don't you dare.

296
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,239
Don't try it.

297
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:25,243
(giggles)

298
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:26,076
- Picnic?

299
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,510
(upbeat pop music)

300
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:57,241
(peaceful electronic music)

301
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:49,791
- [Liana] Thanks.

302
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:51,958
(giggles)

303
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:55,155
- You hungry?
- Yes.

304
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,051
It's nice here.

305
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,367
A Harley rider.

306
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:07,367
- Huh? What?

307
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:11,060
- I said, that bike was fun.

308
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:14,396
- Admiring my body again, huh?

309
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:15,229
- No.

310
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:16,114
No.
- "No."

311
00:26:16,114 --> 00:26:17,309
"Oh, no, no, no."

312
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,142
Hold this.

313
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:29,028
- Alan, this is wonderful.

314
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:32,111
I can't believe you brought all this.

315
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:36,856
- I hate to bring this up, but um...

316
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,547
- [Liana] George?

317
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,380
- Yeah.

318
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:46,676
- We're in the middle of a divorce.

319
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:48,759
- [Alan] Thought as much.

320
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:54,338
- Actually, he's divorcing me.

321
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:58,568
But he's acting like he wants me back,

322
00:26:58,568 --> 00:27:01,985
but I don't want him anymore, it's weird.

323
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,221
I don't know.

324
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:11,425
I've been smothered, Alan.

325
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:15,500
My dreams were smothered.

326
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:21,704
And everything that has to
do with us is falling apart.

327
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:26,017
I don't know, C'est la vie.

328
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:29,706
(Alan speaks French)
(Liana chuckles)

329
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:30,706
- I'm sorry.

330
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:35,427
- You don't need to be sorry for me.

331
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,427
- Yes, I do.

332
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,352
You deserve better.

333
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:54,536
- You're a very gentle man.

334
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:05,736
- What are you doing?

335
00:28:05,736 --> 00:28:07,113
- [Liana] It's illegal
to drink in the park.

336
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:08,714
- But that's champagne.
- I know, but--

337
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:10,645
- It's French champagne.
- Alan, shut up.

338
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,984
We can get arrested.
- Oh, right, of course.

339
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,344
Only in America.
- Hush, hush!

340
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:17,594
Now, just act normal, okay?

341
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:20,914
- Hello.

342
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:22,234
- Hi.
- Hi.

343
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,856
- Nice day for a picnic.

344
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:24,856
- Very nice.

345
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:29,073
(Liana sighs)

346
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,656
What were you so worried about?

347
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:35,643
(Liana giggles)

348
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,861
- Alan, we'd better go.

349
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:46,384
I'm still...

350
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:48,634
- Yeah, I know.

351
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:52,213
You're not finished with the divorce.

352
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,046
- Yeah.

353
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,580
I don't want today to end.

354
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,202
- Neither do I.

355
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:03,869
(peaceful orchestral music)

356
00:29:25,776 --> 00:29:26,609
- Wow.

357
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,492
- And viola!
(Liana laughs)

358
00:29:31,492 --> 00:29:33,195
- This is amazing!

359
00:29:33,195 --> 00:29:35,373
Where did you learn to cook like this?

360
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,275
And don't say it's because
you live in France.

361
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,893
- But, it is.
- Come on, where?

362
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:43,345
- Actually, my wife
was a Cordon Bleu chef.

363
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,185
- Really, a woman Cordon Bleu?

364
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:48,013
- Very rare, especially
for a French woman.

365
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:50,974
- She must have been very special.

366
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,391
- [Alan] She was.

367
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:57,785
- [Liana] I need to
ask you something else.

368
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:59,683
- About Catherine?

369
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:00,516
- Mm-hm.

370
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,534
- About how she died?

371
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:05,701
- Am I prying?

372
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,354
- No, no.

373
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:10,465
- Oh, I shouldn't have asked.

374
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:11,798
- No, it's okay.

375
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:15,810
She died...

376
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,803
She died three years ago in a fire.

377
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,099

378
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,973

379
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:35,056

("Nocturne No. 1 in B-flat
Minor" by Frederic Chopin)

382
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,171

383
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:30,068

385
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:37,531
It only took me a few seconds to get back,

386
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:39,781
but I was already too late.

387
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:45,341
The whole building was engulfed in flames.

388
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:52,888
Can you imagine what it's
like to be so close and yet...

389
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:00,491
I was just a few feet away.

390
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,074
- [Liana] Oh, Alan.

391
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,000
- I shouldn't have told you this.

392
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,583
- I'm glad you did.

393
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,770
- Play something for me.

394
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,243
- I can't.
- Please.

395
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,334
Something simple.

396
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:36,479

413
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,729
I'll call you tomorrow.

414
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:10,059

415
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:11,201
- Can't it wait?

416
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,281

423
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,247
I had to see you.

424

- Well?

425
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:38,859
- They want me to run again.

426
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:40,350
- Who?

427
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,547
- The election committee.

428
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:45,641
They're talking about a
whole new strategy this time.

429
00:35:45,641 --> 00:35:48,641
Back to traditional American values.

430
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,561
Hard work.

431
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:52,394
Integrity.

432
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:54,994
Family.

433
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,630
The things that matter.

434
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,499
- Really?

435
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,832
Congratulations.

436
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,613
- Yeah, it's great.

437
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:10,108
This could be a new beginning.

438
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:10,941
For us.

439
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:17,001
- George, I don't think so.

440
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:20,710
- (chuckles) Come on, it
could be like old times!

441
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,308
A winning strategy, a cause to believe in.

442
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,725
Working together.

443
00:36:26,681 --> 00:36:27,514
- Sure.

444
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:31,281
Traditional values, family.

445
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:32,781
A supportive wife.

446
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,390
I understand.

447
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,961
- This is my chance, Liana.

448
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:39,619
Don't let me down.

449
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:42,521
- George, don't play games with me.

450
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,688
I'm not your wife anymore.

451
00:36:47,298 --> 00:36:48,131
- Yeah.

452
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,552
That's for sure.

453
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:56,601
Hey, we're still friends, aren't we?

454
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,539
Aren't you gonna let me in?

455
00:36:58,539 --> 00:36:59,481
- No.

456
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:02,110
- (chuckles) Why not?

457
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,943
- Because she already has company.

458
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:12,798
- Well, well, if it isn't Liberace.

459
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,179
- Leave us alone, George.

460
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:18,521
- What am I interrupting?

461
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,630
A piano lesson? (chuckles)

462
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,819
- George, please.

463
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:25,988
- You just couldn't wait, could you?

464
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,670
Even if it ruins me.

465
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,721
- Don't do this.

466
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:32,249
- Why don't you leave?

467
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,699
Before somebody gets hurt.

468
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:35,532
- Hurt?

469
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,193
Before someone gets hurt?

470
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:46,368
Oh, I think somebody is
definitely going to get hurt.

471
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,850
Au revoir, maestro.

472
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,713
(dark orchestral music)

473
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,368
- What does he want?

474
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,357
Don't look at me.

475
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:41,436
- Alright, let's start at the beginning.

476
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,718
Why did you marry the man?

477
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:52,792
- Well...

478
00:38:56,957 --> 00:38:59,874
When I first met him, George was...

479
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:03,301
I don't know.

480
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:05,350
Dynamic.

481
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:08,527
He seemed to have this vision.

482
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:10,469
He wanted to change the world.

483
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:13,888
And I wanted to be part of that.

484
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,221
It was exciting.

485
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:20,517
And then he was elected to state senate

486
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:24,058
and looked like we were on our way.

487
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,808
I guess I was seduced a little by

488
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:33,126
all the energy and the
excitement of politics.

489
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:34,626
And so was George.

490
00:39:35,658 --> 00:39:38,741
But with him, it became an obsession.

491
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:43,229
After a while, all he
cared about was winning.

492
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:45,312
Not about helping people.

493
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:52,677
And then two years ago,
he wasn't re-elected.

494
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:57,517
Since then, he hasn't cared
about anything important.

495
00:39:57,517 --> 00:40:00,017
It's as if he's lost his soul.

496
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,289
- Or stolen yours.

497
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:13,267
- He wasn't mean at
first, just disappointed.

498
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:18,578
But now he's different, he's bitter

499
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:21,495
and he's blaming me for everything.

500
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:25,938
I don't know whether he
loves me or he hates me.

501
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:26,855
It's scary.

502
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:33,251
He's been such a bastard.

503
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:35,679
- I've noticed.

504
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:40,098
(Liana sighs)

505
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:42,681
Do you want me to stay a while?

506
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,271
- I'd like that.

507
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,232
Alan.

508
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:53,411

509
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,335

Angeles is tomorrow night.

512

for San Francisco?

- Six weeks.

(doctor chuckles)

550
00:50:59,477 --> 00:51:00,310
- Ow!

551
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:02,459
- Oh, I'm--

552
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,917
- Honey, no.

553
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:07,797
- No, stop, stop, what are you gonna do?

554
00:51:07,797 --> 00:51:08,837
- What can I do? I'll call my agent.

555
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:11,555
His life will be hell
for a couple of days.

556
00:51:11,555 --> 00:51:14,545
He'll finally have a chance
to earn his commission.

557
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:16,585
- What about all your fans?

558
00:51:16,585 --> 00:51:18,867
- We'll reschedule.

559
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:22,117
Besides, I could use a little time off.

560
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:28,185
- I've made such a mess of things.

561
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,505
- [Alan] It's not your fault.

562
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:31,717
- Yes, it is, I feel awful about this.

563
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:34,300
- It's not bothering me at all.

564
00:51:35,987 --> 00:51:36,820
Hey.

565
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,056
Maybe we could go somewhere together.

566
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,477
- What?

567
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,448
- Get out of the city.

568
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,985
If it wasn't for George, we
wouldn't have this opportunity

569
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:48,152
to find out more about us.

570
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,944
- (chuckles) Wait a minute.

571
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:57,386
Are you sure about this?

572
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,303
- Trust me.

573
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,869
(energetic piano music)
- (chuckles) Not today.

574
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:10,036
(upbeat rock music)
- (chuckles) Alright.

575
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,553
Oh, look!

576
00:52:28,914 --> 00:52:30,959
- Oh, this is beautiful.

577
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:33,867
(Liana sighs)

578
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,239
- I think we're up here.
- Up there?

579
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,489
- [Liana] Yeah.

580
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:48,652
Come on, I'll race ya.
- (chuckles) I don't think so.

581
00:52:48,652 --> 00:52:50,182
- Why not?

582
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:51,182
Oh, come on.

583
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,382
It's great.

584
00:52:59,382 --> 00:53:01,742
(Alan chuckles)

585
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:03,742
(gasps)

586
00:53:14,132 --> 00:53:15,921
"Dear Liana.

587
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:20,088
"To our first kiss in
Washington Square 10 years ago.

588
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:25,808
"You were beautiful then, you
are even more beautiful now."

589
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:32,668
Alan, you're the one who's beautiful.

590
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:38,476
- I'll make us a fire.

591
00:53:38,476 --> 00:53:39,309
- Great.

592
00:53:57,865 --> 00:53:59,065
(low-pitched piano notes)

593
00:53:59,065 --> 00:53:59,898
- No.

594
00:54:00,814 --> 00:54:02,974
No piano, I'm on vacation.

595
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:03,807
- Sorry.

596
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,922
(peaceful pop music)

597
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,602
- [Alan] Very romantic.

598
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:19,435
- Uh-huh.

599
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,338
(fire crackles)

600
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:18,078
- So, what are you gonna do
for the rest of your life, huh?

601
00:55:18,078 --> 00:55:20,758
(Liana chuckles)

602
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:22,008
- I don't know.

603
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:29,558
Sometimes I've dreamed of
having my own music school.

604
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:30,928
- You can still do it.

605
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:31,761
- Yeah.

606
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:35,152
I love children.

607
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,480
- You really are wonderful.

608
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:31,623
(waves crash)

609
00:58:49,732 --> 00:58:50,565
Catherine.

610
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:57,024
I've lost so much, Liana.

611
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,789
- She was beautiful.

612
00:59:06,511 --> 00:59:07,761
- Like our son.

613
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:11,118
- You have a son?

614
00:59:12,613 --> 00:59:13,863
- He's six now.

615
00:59:15,882 --> 00:59:18,922
He's in school, I never see him.

616
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,339
I'm gone so much.

617
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:27,533
The kid's growing up without me,

618
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,813
and I feel like I'm losing him.

619
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:32,031
- Oh, that's awful.

620
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:35,948
- I couldn't tell you
before, I don't know why.

621
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:42,491
- How did he survive the fire?

622
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:46,824
- He was with me buying the paper.

623
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:56,569
- What's he like?
(Alan chuckles)

624
00:59:56,569 --> 00:59:58,986
- He's a boy, he's a handful.

625
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:07,564
(melancholic string music)

626
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:12,061
I'm not holding the torch for her.

627
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,561
I know she's gone.

628
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:20,351
- I did notice you took your ring off.

629
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,184
- Yeah.

630
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,506
Liana, this is part of who I am.

631
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:35,370
Every time I see Robert,
it reminds me of Catherine.

632
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:39,203
Which is maybe why I
don't see him that often.

633
01:00:40,981 --> 01:00:44,981
- You've gotta spend more
time with your son, Alan.

634
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:45,814
- I know.

635
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:51,689
- Come on, let's go to bed.

636
01:01:12,626 --> 01:01:15,126
(waves crash)

637
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:22,759
- Yeah, I'll be back soon, Robert

638
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:25,426
(speaks French)

639
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,997
I miss you a lot.

640
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,163
What?

641
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:34,917
(speaks French)

642
01:01:34,917 --> 01:01:37,894
I'm bringing you a present.

643
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,845
(speaks French)

644
01:01:40,845 --> 01:01:41,678
Take care.

645
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:46,632
(speaks French)

646
01:02:01,602 --> 01:02:02,685
- How was he?

647
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:05,383
- He misses me.

648
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:07,980
But he's okay.

649
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:10,656
- Good.

650
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,673
Come on.

651
01:03:26,808 --> 01:03:30,975
("Piano Sonata No. 11" by
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)

652
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,247
(Alan claps)

653
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:49,664
I did it.
(Alan chuckles)

654
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:53,515
- Okay?
- Okay.

655
01:04:58,641 --> 01:04:59,549
Well?

656
01:04:59,549 --> 01:05:01,100
Aren't you coming?

657
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,330
- Yeah.

658
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,997
Yeah, I'll catch up.

659
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,578
- What are you doing?

660
01:05:06,578 --> 01:05:10,188
- Never mind, just go
ahead, I'll catch up.

661
01:05:10,188 --> 01:05:11,840
Shoo, go.

662
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,530
- Shoo? (chuckles)

663
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,363
Okay.

664
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,440
(Alan hums melodically)

665
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,107
(Alan whistles melodically)

01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:36,868
(melancholic orchestral music)

667
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:41,379
(ominous tones)

668
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,822
(water splashes)

669
01:07:27,975 --> 01:07:29,308
We need to talk.

670
01:07:31,243 --> 01:07:33,255
- I'm happy you're playing again.

671
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:35,202
- It's like I have a part of my life back.

672
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:36,593
- I knew you could do it.

673
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:39,695
- Yeah. (chuckles)

674
01:07:39,695 --> 01:07:41,505
- You haven't lost your touch.

675
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:42,842
Not in here.

676
01:07:42,842 --> 01:07:43,675
- I know.

677
01:07:45,302 --> 01:07:46,983
- But we're not really talking about

678
01:07:46,983 --> 01:07:48,903
what you wanna talk about, are we?

679
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:49,736
- No.
- No.

680
01:07:59,383 --> 01:08:02,103
- Catherine and Robert
are part of who you are.

681
01:08:02,103 --> 01:08:02,936
- Yes.

682
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:07,491
- The question is, am I okay with that?

683
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:09,624
- Are you?

684
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:11,942
- I don't know.

685
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:14,292
I wonder if I'll ever measure up

686
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:16,625
to your memory of Catherine.

687
01:08:18,132 --> 01:08:21,063
- That's what she's
become, Liana, a memory.

688
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:24,040
You helped me realize that.

689
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,040
You are my here and now.

690
01:08:30,052 --> 01:08:31,719
- What about Robert?

691
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:35,831
- He'll love you as much as I do.

692
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:40,739
- Look.

693
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:41,906
- It's lovely.

694
01:08:44,629 --> 01:08:48,002
- [Liana] I've been so
happy being here with you.

695
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:50,335
But does anything ever last?

696
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:53,431
- I don't know.

697
01:08:54,522 --> 01:08:56,522
Nothing is ever perfect.

698
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,503
It's like playing Mozart.

699
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:03,945
You never get it exactly right.

700
01:09:05,701 --> 01:09:09,162
But if you're willing and practice,

701
01:09:09,162 --> 01:09:11,581
it gets better and better.

702
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:14,981
(peaceful music)

703
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,481
I love you, Liana.

704
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,550
- I love you, too.

705
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,949

706
01:09:35,949 --> 01:09:36,782

719
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:24,779
- No, that's enough.

720
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:26,680
- Hey, any park rangers around?

721
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,480

man out there just waiting

(ominous music)

723
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:34,851
- George, what are you doing here?

724
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:36,434
- Enough is enough.

725
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,788
- My business is with Liana.

726
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:40,826
- How did you know we were here?

727
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:42,865
- You left the address on your phone pad.

728
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:44,185
- You broke into my house?

729
01:10:44,185 --> 01:10:46,065
- It's not your house yet.

730
01:10:46,065 --> 01:10:47,732
- Let it go, George!

731
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,998
- I want you back.

732
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:53,848
- It's too late for that.

733
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:54,990
- I want you back!

734
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,740
- No!
- It's too late!

735
01:11:00,296 --> 01:11:02,796
- Well, if I can't have you...

736
01:11:03,678 --> 01:11:04,678
Nobody will!

737
01:11:13,092 --> 01:11:15,382
- What are we gonna do?

738
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:16,882
- Call the police?

739
01:11:18,452 --> 01:11:19,285
- I can't.

740
01:11:20,252 --> 01:11:22,169
- He's obviously crazy.

741
01:11:24,343 --> 01:11:25,676
- I know, but...

742
01:11:30,033 --> 01:11:32,616
- I think we'd better get back.

(suspenseful music)

744
01:12:56,478 --> 01:12:58,105
Dearest Liana.

745
01:12:58,105 --> 01:13:00,358
The soul of this old piano has awakened

746
01:13:00,358 --> 01:13:02,097
to your loving touch.

747
01:13:02,097 --> 01:13:03,427
And so has mine.

748
01:13:03,427 --> 01:13:05,677
Je t'aime forever and ever.

No, no!

753
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:18,843
No!

754
01:13:18,843 --> 01:13:19,676
No, no!

755
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:22,220
No!

766
01:13:58,307 --> 01:13:59,807
Help!

767
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,057
- It's George, he's inside!

768
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,266
Alan, what are we gonna do?
(George screams)

769
01:14:07,266 --> 01:14:09,298
- [George] Help!

770
01:14:09,298 --> 01:14:10,398
- I don't know.

771
01:14:10,398 --> 01:14:11,767
No, stay here!

772
01:14:11,767 --> 01:14:13,198

773
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:14,031

776
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:28,376
Help!

777
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:31,203
- Alan, don't.

(fire roars and crackles)
(dramatic music)

779
01:14:39,693 --> 01:14:40,526

I'm sorry.

786
