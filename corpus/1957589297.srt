[robot voice reads the text]

00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,364
- I'm 28, I'm bisexual, and I am currently

4
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,266
sharing myself with three lovers.

5
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,302
And I say sharing because we're all equally

6
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,372
giving to one another in our little house of love.

7
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:41,808
We were the first to meet.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,745
- Hi, I'm Cuddelz and I'm a 19 year old twink.

9
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,814
What? I am a twink.

10
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,782
(giggling)

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,517
Anywho, we met on Bumble BFF,

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,587
which is a section of the Bumble app for meeting friends,

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,456
AKA cuddle buddies.

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,759
- I took her home and we cuddled everywhere.

15
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,228
(soft music)

16
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,435
- Our heart chakras were wide open for each other.

17
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:12,238
I pressed her so tenderly to my naked chest.

18
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,808
It was like bonding mommies and babies.

19
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,444
Except we exploded with orgasms.

20
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,579
(giggling)

21
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,549
- Well, Lez was the second lover I met.

22
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,652
And it was love at first sight at that

23
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,820
eighties themed dyke bar.

24
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,455
- Oh yeah, I walked over to her

25
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,757
with a couple of audios motherfuckers in tow

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,358
and asked her to grind.

27
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,828
- We grinded very sensually to Time After Time.

28
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,664
- She was definitely the hottest bitch

29
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,399
at the Clit Clit Boom that night.

30
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,403
And I knew something real was gonna happen.

31
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,871
Or at least that we'd trib a whole bunch.

32
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,239
- Baby.

33
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,908
- Like they know what it means.

[robot voice reads the text]

35
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,515
- Well, now they do.

36
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,554
Lastly, but not least to meet was Tucker.

37
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,656
Do you wanna...

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,291
- Oh yeah. - Sorry.

39
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,261
- (chuckles) And admittedly it happened

40
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,796
in a pretty heterosexual way

41
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,431
but it was still beautiful.

42
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,900
- Here I was at this huge 4th of July beach party.

43
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,735
- And he hit me so hard in the face

44
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:18,204
with this plushy beach ball,

45
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,539
(laughs) beach ball toy,

46
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:22,809
that it actually Chuck Norris'ed my eye pouch.

(laughing)

48
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,912
Ow!

49
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,413
Oh.

50
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,548
- Hi.

51
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,818
Well, I made up for her with a bottle of cranberry juice.

52
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,254
And I also asked her to dance with me to,

53
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,756
what's the name of that country girl?

54
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,857
Taylor Swift.

55
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,225
Yeah, Taylor Swift. - Excuse me.

56
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,627
Taylor Swift is not country anymore.

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,895
Like for a long-- - She was at the time.

58
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,663
She was at the time, right?

59
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,831
- A long time.

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,799
- But the fact that he was so willing

61
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,271
to open his heart to me and take my lovers as his lovers.

62
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,274
I've never met a more open and beautiful

63
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,375
straight man before.

64
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,876
- Well and thus began my journey

65
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,345
into this polyamorous relationship.

- Jesus, Tucker, who is that?

72
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
- That's my dad.

73
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,597
- What, is he texting like one word at a time?

74
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,865
- Well actually, yes.

75
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,900
He is texting one word at a time.

76

He doesn't know how to text.

00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:27,840
Huh.

- What's wrong?

80
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,518
- My parents are coming to visit us.

81
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,021
- Okay and that's bad news why?

82
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,624
- I haven't seen my parents for over two years.

83
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,627
So they don't really know about my...

84
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,397
Lovers situation.

85
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,299
Per se.

86
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,801
- What?

87
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,937
Tucker, we've been together for two years.

88
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,740
How have we never come up in conversation?

89
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,508
- You have but it's just,

90
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,677
every time you guys come up in a conversation,

91
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,480
I kind of refer to you guys as my girlfriend.

92
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:08,948
- [Lez] You gotta be fricking kidding me, Tucker.

93
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,483
- Why, what's going on?

94
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,819
- Tucker's parents are coming to visit.

95
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:13,720
- Yay!

96
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,389
- [Lez] And they don't know about us.

97
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,424
- Well, I'll take that yay back.

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,060
- Does it worry me?

99
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,829
Yeah, it does.

100
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,766
Look, I know that coming out to your parents is a huge deal

101
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,736
and I'm not gonna try and push him into it but

102
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,807
in my experience, hidden relationships don't end well.

103
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,444
They usually just...

104
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,381
End.

105
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,983
- I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

106
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,551
I just don't know how to tell my parents

107
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,454
I have three lovers and one of them is a guy.

108
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,424
- Okay Tucker, Cuddelz is your girlfriend, okay?

109
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,893
- Correction, he's my boyfriend.

110
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,928
- Something interesting about me.

111
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,863
I hate labels.

112
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,967
- [Lez] Cuddelz is your girlfriend because she goes by she.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,602
- She goes by they.

114
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,370
So they is he and she. - She always goes

115
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,372
by she with me. - Well, but she goes by--

116
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,576
- Lez, I'm a boy 'cause I have a penis and I love it.

117
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,744
- Thank you.

118
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,847
- Tucker, I'm also a girl because I have a feminine soul.

119
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,017
So how about gender neutral?

120
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,953
No he, no she, no left, no right.

121
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,589
No bullshit, no BS.

122
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,858
Non-binary.

123
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,126
It's not that hard.

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,363
Pretty sure your parents would get it right away.

125
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,966
- Do we all identify differently?

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,967
Yes, that's true.

127
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,970
But I think it's good we're all so diverse.

128
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,872
It keeps things interesting.

129
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,741
Fresh.

130
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,009
It's sexy.

131
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,410
- It's very draining.

132
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,880
Having to live up to the expectations

133
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,617
and having your lovers trying to put you in a box.

134
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,420
Not even my parents were like that.

135
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,456
But then again, I'm aware that it's not

136
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,159
everybody's as lucky as I am, especially Tucker.

137
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,896
He's from a very small town, conservative.

138
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,532
So yeah, it must be very difficult for him

139
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:11,571
to come out in a polyamorous relationship.

140
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,972
Yeah.

141
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,073
What are we gonna do about it?

142
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,042
They gotta stay with us.

143
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,578
- No, I was thinking they can stay in a hotel

144
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,514
and I can just go and stay-- - No, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,949
I have an idea.

146
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,784
- I was afraid of that.

147
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,753
- Lez. - What?

148
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,653
- Drag time.

149
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,523
- Tucker. - I'm sorry.

150
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,892
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

151
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,698
- Cuddelz is the best in having the worst ideas.

152
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,469
So I am complying with them because...

153
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,573
Well, Cuddelz is forcing me to.

154
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,977
(upbeat country music)

155
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,580
- Okay, so here's the deal.

156
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,651
So your parents will take the guest room.

157
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,054
Lez and I will pass as a straight couple roommates.

158
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,789
You know what I'm saying?

159
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,024
And Abigail will take the lead.

160
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,093
I know, it's not fully there yet.

161
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:12,031
I was aiming for something like a John Wayne type of deal.

162
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:16,068
Although it turned out a little something like a Joanne.

163
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,471
But I think we can pass.

164
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,107
Maybe if we change a little thing or two.

165
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,009
I don't know, the socks?

166
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,481
Right?

167
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,953
You look gorg.

168
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:34,854
Yee-haw.

169
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,860
- Well.

170
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,929
Eh.

171
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,498
Hmm.

172
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,742
(soft music)

173
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,088
- Abs, I just--

174
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,057
- I think you look pretty.

175
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,093
Ish.

176
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,664
- Look, I love Tucker and I'd do anything for him.

177
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,202
But this isn't me.

178
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,872
This isn't anybody. - I know.

179
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,841
- My parents used to dress me this way.

180
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,578
I feel like I'm being pulled back in the closet.

181
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,581
It's a very dark place to be in.

182
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,564
- I knew this day would come sooner or later.

183
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,834
And it's here, it's happening.

184
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,868
(chuckles)

185
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,972
So yeah, I think I should just, you know, man up.

186
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,174
I guess it's time to man up.

187
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:09,215
Okay guys, this is not gonna work out.

188
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,816
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,285
Cuddelz.

190
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,686
You look like you came out of Toy Story.

191
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,054
- What? - Yeah, you do.

192
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:15,955
- And Lez.

193
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,691
No.

194
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,228
Guys, the truth is I cannot have you guys

195
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,030
pretending to be who you're not.

196
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,633
I love three beautiful people that I'm proud of.

197
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,137
That I have to stand up for.

198
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,104
I have to stand up for you guys.

199
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,906
I have to stand up for us.

200
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,877
So I thought about it and well...

201
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,750
Well, I decided that I,

202
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm gonna tell my parents.

203
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,393
Well, my parents are not coming.

204
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,895
Yeah, it turned out that my mom

205
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,730
doesn't really want her new boobs.

206
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,332
She said that God made her that way

207
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,000
and she feels more comfortable with her body

208
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,068
the way it is right now.

209
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,104
My dad, on the other hand, he's pretty disappointed.

210
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,773
He was really looking forward to the new...

211
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,409
Wife, I guess.

212
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,644
So yeah.

213
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,852
- Having four lovers means you need to be very mindful

214
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,287
of balancing everyday life.

215
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,422
For example, we don't let Lez

216
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,791
do any of the grocery shopping anymore.

217
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,294
- Hey, babe.

218
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,195
- Hi.

219
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,032
- I got the milk and eggs.

220
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,869
- Oh, I told you to get salmon too.

221
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,805
- No.

222
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,473
No.

223
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,211
You-- - What the hell is this?

224
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,212
- [Lez] Salmon milk.

225
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,784
- I did not, in any way, say to get salmon milk.

226
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,185
- Okay, you said get salmon milk and eggs.

227
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,822
So I got salmon milk and eggs. - Are you kidding me, baby?

228
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,793
I said get salmon and milk and eggs.

229
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,196
- Hold on, that's not fair because the text message,

230
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,233
you see there's no and here, there's no comma,

231
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,467
so what am I supposed to, look.

232
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,202
I got you chicken eggs too,

233
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,171
but Lord knows I don't get credit for that.

234
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,041
- Okay, but why would I want salmon milk?

235
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,375
This is disgusting.

236
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,779
- Okay, okay, let's just calm down here.

237
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,948
Everybody calm down because anything can be milk nowadays.

238
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,785
There's soy milk, there's cashew milk, there's goat milk.

239
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,822
- Okay, but where does one even go to get salmon milk?

240
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,890
- Little Armenia.

241
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,828
- Lez does have a good head on her shoulders sometimes,

242
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,431
but honestly, Tucker's the most realistic.

243
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,734
I mean, he can shop, he can make plans but

244
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,103
if I had one complaint against Tucker,

245
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:49,275
it's that he has been roughhousing with Lez way too much.

246
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,912
(groaning) - Too easy.

247
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,113
I'm gonna put you to sleep.

248
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,082
I don't know how to do this one correctly.

249
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,349
- It's correct.

250
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,485
(groaning)

251
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,187
- Tap it out. - I can't.

252
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,354
- Tap.

253
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,956
I used to be a backyard wrestler.

254
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:05,891
Part of a

255
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,327
feminist wrestling movement.

256
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,964
I called myself Gloria Stunem

257
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,466
and I'd be introduced before every fight

258
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,434
with the Patti Smith song, Gloria.

259
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,436
♪ Gloria

260
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,372
- My famous move was the Steinem Stunner.

261
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,109
Bam!

262
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,143
(laughs)

263
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,847
So when you punch someone, you punch through them.

264
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,282
Not at them, through them.

265
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,151
- All right, okay. - Okay, go.

266
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,285
- Okay.

267
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,488
(groaning)

268
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,388
- Fell right into that.

269
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,390
- Okay, baby. - Tap out.

270
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,359
You gotta tap out, you gotta tap out.

271
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,494
- Oh my God. - Guys.

272
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,863
This is a room of peace.

273
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,834
- You okay? - So unnecessary.

274
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,069
Huh? I'm fine, yeah.

275
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,604
Let's go again.

276
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,906
I know it sounds childish but

277
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,241
I really like wrestling with Lez.

278
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,211
I think it's bringing our relationship to a whole new level.

279
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,413
I mean, she did sprain the hell out of my leg the other day

280
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,184
when she flew at me with the Nelly Bly Insane Head Dive.

281
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,852
But damn.

282
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,954
That was worth it.

283
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,425
- I was famous for my aerial techniques.

284
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,594
We used to set up 10 foot ladders

285
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,432
and I'd just bash down on attractive women.

286
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,435
And I had an arsenal of deadly moves.

287
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,905
I had the Hillary Rodham Body Slam.

288
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,006
That one hurt.

289
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,209
And my favorite,

290
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,444
besides the Steinem Stunner, of course,

291
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,914
was the RBG Flying Knee.

292
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,216
(groans)

293
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,484
(laughs)

294
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,186
You know, 'cause she's old.

295
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,889
- Look, I love my lovers loving each other,

296
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,558
but fighting is not loving.

297
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm a cuddle bear and all this knee throwing,

298
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,563
head banging, Saturday Night Smackdown business

299
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,932
is no good for Mama Cuddelz.

300
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,601
- It concerns me.

301
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,938
This reemergence of wrestling in Lez's life.

302
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,539
I mean, that's how she met her ex.

303
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,174
And that was not exactly

304
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,410
the healthiest relationship in the world.

305
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,147
- Ooh.

306
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,884
They told you about the ex.

307
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,321
Yeah, she was a feminist wrestler too.

308
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,392
She went by Sojourner You Can't Handle the Truth.

309
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,965
Well, it was quite a rocky relationship.

310
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,200
We were drunk off our athletic powers.

311
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,669
I had to join SLAA to get over her.

312
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,605
[robot voice reads the text]

313
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,275
- Funny thing, when I told my mom that I joined SLAA,

314
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,010
she thought that meant I quit wrestling

315
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,412
to join a terrorist organization.

316
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,049
[robot voice reads the text]

317
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,218
- She asked me if I remember

318
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,620
when they kidnapped the Hearst girl

319
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,989
and I wasn't even born yet, Mom.

320
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,028
My love addict sponsor was kind of shady though.

321
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,332
In fact, I still have that .22 around here somewhere for him.

322
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,402
- I'm just worried that this new roughhousing thing

323
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:08,107
is gonna get in the way of our relationship's balance.

324
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,509
You know?

325
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,345
(groaning) - Yeah, yeah.

326
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,650
You gotta tap out. - You, tough guys.

327
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,685
Do you want to see what tough is?

328
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,053
Get up.

329
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,422
- [Tucker] Okay.

330
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,192
What are you doing?

331
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,495
- I'm throwing shade at you, redneck.

332
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:37,102
[robot voice reads the text]

333
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,572
- We've got monkey. (grunts)

334
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,273
The snake.

335
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,611
The rona. - Okay, all right.

336
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,613
- What are you doing?

337
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,615
- It's called Vogue.

338
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,617
Voguing, okay?

339
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,485
Read a book once in awhile.

340
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,026
[robot voice reads the text]

341
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,761
- No, I got this.

342
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,030
All right, we got the bus driver.

343
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,801
- (scoffs) Okay. - Okay, I lost.

344
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,136
- Oh yeah, you did.

345
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,740
I don't want you two fighting here no more, okay?

346
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,277
Take it outside, honey, thank you.

347
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,645
- We can't fight in here anymore.

348
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,747
- Because of that?

349
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,115
- Meet you outside.

350
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,486
(playful music)

351
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,223
- Does anyone know how to explain what happened?

352
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,792
- Thanks for taking care of that, babe.

353
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,828
- Babe, I love when I please you.

354
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,763
- You always please me.

355
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,498
She always pleases me.

356
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,667
She is my mediator.

357
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,302
I mean, our mediator.

358
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,237
- Babe, the compliments are turning me on.

359
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,772
- If it wasn't for Cuddelz,

360
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,208
everything in this house would be broken.

361
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,544
(clattering) - [Lez] That's the one.

362
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,545
- By now.

363
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,480
(shattering) - Oh, hell no.

364
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,615
I'm about to jump up like a spider monkey

365
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,319
and do the splits so hard in your little destructive faces.

366
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,590
I'm about to put my legs so far over my head,

367
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,525
it's gonna make your head spin.

368
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,798
(yawns)

369
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,500
It's too early, it's like 8:30 a.m.

370
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,869
and all my lovers are already on their way

371
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,470
to make that dollar.

372
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,306
- That's disgusting.

373
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,509
- Bye, babe. - Bye, babe.

374
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,879
- Bye, babe. - See you later, baby.

375
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,347
- [Lez] Yeah you will.

376
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,216
Hey, hey.

377
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,587
- Oh, I like the way you eat a peach.

378
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,224
- Bye, babe.

379
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,364
- I'm not really a nine to five kind of girl.

380
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,138
Hello, all my body positive warriors.

381
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,175
Remember, you cannot Photoshop personality.

382
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,344
Hello, my little sweet Padawans.

383
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,581
Today we're gonna learn how to knit our own moccasins.

384
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,318
First words of wisdom, do not be afraid of color.

385
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,590
- [Narrator] Slip the pants off

386
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,892
and put both legs into one side.

387
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,928
Now, pull them up over your chest.

388
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,764
Take the unused pant leg, scrunch it up,

389
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,332
and slide your head through.

390
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,673
- But wait, why do I look so good?

391
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,879
I really hustle to get shares and likes

392
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,848
and ultimately compensation for my work.

393
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,249
So screw that nine to five.

394
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,550
I mean, don't get me wrong.

395
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,854
I really respect what my lovers are doing.

396
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:42,754
They hustle too.

397
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,457
A lot, actually.

398
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,761
- I hate my job.

399
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,266
But the corporate benefits include great dental insurance.

400
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,870
- My job is very hands-on.

401
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,605
Sometimes I have to release their stress

402
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,607
by taking it in myself.

403
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,376
(client groans)

404
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,313
- People don't realize how important my job really is.

405
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,850
For example.

406
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,253
For all I know, this could be a bomb.

407
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,724
(clattering)

408
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,263
- Yeah, I gotta hand it to my lovers.

409
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,331
They're really hard workers.

410
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,601
(soft playful music)

411
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,808
(doorbell rings)

412
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,410
The Mormons.

413
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,213
They change the guys but they keep their schedule.

414
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,219
They're usually very adorable.

415
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,490
Hi, blessed be the fruit.

416
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,827
- Hi, I'm Elder Andrew and this is Elder Drew.

417
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,597
- Oh Andrew and Drew.

418
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,632
Hmm.

419
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,633
How cute.

420
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,636
You guys have the same name and the same clothes.

421
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,338
- [Both] Well, the names were by chance.

422
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,740
- Sorry, the names were by chance.

423
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,443
- That's why we shortened them at different ends.

424
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,478
But the clothing are special holy garments

425
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,347
that the church makes us wear for protection.

426
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,516
- That we choose to wear.

427
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,451
- Oh, yes. - Oh you choose to wear the

428
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,354
interesting fashion statement. - Lucifer.

429
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,323
- What?

430
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,958
- When you're playing on the devil's playground,

431
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,026
you need to be protected in the right garbs.

432
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,861
- Oh okay, I do have a little pendulum

433
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,665
but no protection in the world would make me wear that.

434
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,367
Especially under the sun.

435
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,835
- I do like your hat though.

436
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,005
- Thank you.

437
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,406
Cookies?

438
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,710
- Chocolate chip?

439
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,745
- If you want some milk with it, you may come inside.

440
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,448
And I just realized that came out really wrong.

441
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,882
- Thank you but today we're only sharing

442
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,784
our pamphlets with gospel lessons.

443
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,753
And if you're interested, we can schedule a meeting--

444
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,788
- Okay, pamphlets for me is like nudes.

445
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,957
I only trade, so here's mine.

446
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,958
It's all my handles.

447
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,394
Twitter, Instagram, TikTok.

448
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,996
Also Only Fans, but that's something else.

449
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,531
I'm about to hit 100 K subs.

450
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,033
I just need a little push from the Lord.

451
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,936
So who better than the representatives to help out?

452
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,337
- Okay, we have to go.

453
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,505
Thank you for the cookies.

454
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,540
- No worries, have a nice day.

455
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,541
- Excuse me.

456
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,779
How can someone ignore societal rules and be just like you?

457
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,383
- Like what?

458
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:25,884
- Fabulous.

459
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,722
(clears throat)

460
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,828
- So I like to bake at least once a week for my babies

461
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:42,034
because I feel like the smell of freshly baked cookies

462
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,769
with a little rip of salvia

463
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,570
makes our home feel a little bit more,

464
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,572
what's the word I'm looking for?

465
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,573
Homely.

466
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,642
(phone rings)

467
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,078
This is my Abigail angel calling.

468
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,947
She does this every time during lunch.

469
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,016
Stressed about work and stuff.

470
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,985
Hello, my angel.

471
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,453
Ooh, it sounds stressful.

472
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,055
- [Abigail] I can't do it anymore.

473
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,624
I'm not a boss bitch, I'm a fake.

474
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,726
I almost choked on my tuna club sandwich

475
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,997
because I couldn't stop crying long enough to chew properly.

476
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,469
I'm a fake loser bitch who chokes on soft fish sandwiches.

477
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,406
- (shushes) Babe, babe, listen to me.

478
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,643
You're a strong, beautiful, independent woman.

479
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,112
And you have earned the right to eat carbs

480
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,880
at any time of the day.

481
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,483
So free the gluten and remember,

482
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,587
the softest sandwiches are the hardest to swallow.

483
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,024
Struggle's real, it's not on you.

484
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,759
Okay? Mama loves you.

485
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,631
I mean, back to baking. (chuckles)

486
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,468
So the way I like to do the dough...

487
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,073
We used to have this gorgeous datura tree

488
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,608
right out this window.

489
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,444
Oh.

490
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,146
I actually used to make tea

491
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,782
off of the beautiful bell-shaped flowers.

492
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:08,153
I read somewhere that datura is essential recipe

493
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,656
in love potions and witches brew.

[robot voice reads the text]

495

496
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,003
You know, Lez ripped it out.

497
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,838
My dad is so protective of me.

00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,510
My tree!

502
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,730
Kathy Bates.

503
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:58,270
So it is 5:25 and my lovers should be here any time soon.

504
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,473
I like them to come home to a very welcoming house.

505
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,108
You can still smell the cookies.

506
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,111
I have champagne on ice waiting for them.

507
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,946
I put some snacks out

508
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,750
and a little cuddly space for relaxation.

509
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:16,621
And oh, I look absolutely royal right now.

Oh, they just arrived.

You guys arrived all at the same time.

How are you?

- So beautiful, so beautiful. - So beautiful.

517
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,739
- See how grateful they are of me?

518
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,942
I'm the backbone of this house.

519
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,710
Don't I look gorg?

520

- Oh boo. - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

We were having so much fun doing poppers last night.

00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,524
- Wait a second.

722
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,526
- Are you okay, babe?

723
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,261
- [Lez] You smell great.

724
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,197
- Thank you.

725
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,632
- You smell really fricking great.

726
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,502
- That was the goal.

727
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,904
Well, I didn't really put anything--

728
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,140
- (shushes) Wait here.

729
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,677
(soft mellow music)

730
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,854
(whimpers)

731
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,288
Run.

732
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,662
- Lez and I, we already have a very

733
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,666
deep, strong, loving

734
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,602
mental relationship.

735
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,441
- Tucker.

736
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,180
(soft mellow music)

737
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,458
I can smell you.

738
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,464
(soft mellow music)

739
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,967
- About the whole strap-on thing.

740
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,536
Like that, dig that.

741
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,539
But it's just not what I was looking for that night.

742
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,575
But there's one thing that I really learned about Lez

743
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,578
is that she has a very strong sense of smell.

744
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,680
(chuckles) There's no hiding from her.

745
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,683
Sharp, like a hound dog.

746
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,754
She will find you.

747
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,959
- So tonight is Lez's turn for date night

748
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,027
and I am surprised.

749
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,429
She is skipping the scenic drive portion of the date

750
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,765
and going right to intimate stage.

751
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,601
Can't believe it.

752
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,272
Who do you think is going first?

753
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,040
- Oh, it's gonna be me.

754
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,708
I have this feeling.

755
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,280
- You.

756
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,617
- You're up.

757
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,385
Get in there, buster.

758
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,323
- Do you still have the poppers?

759
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,258
- Good luck. - Now!

760
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,629
(soft mellow music)

761
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,434
- You want to finish Sophie's Choice?

762
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,668
- Hell yeah. - Okay.

763
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,744
Lately, Lez and I have been having some hard days.

764
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,314
She used to be so possessive of me.

765
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,817
Very possessive.

766
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,353
- Baby.

767
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,757
- And I like that about my Lez.

768
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,860
But recently, she doesn't seem as interested in me anymore.

769
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,598
I never thought I'd face LDB with such a virile lesbian.

770
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:53,871
[robot voice reads the text]

771
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,941
- Hmm, so I get up in front of everybody

772
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,909
to read my poem and I am shaking so bad.

773
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,478
But I remind myself,

774
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,046
it's the first sentence that's the hardest.

775
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,515
So I tell myself to breathe and...

776
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:07,685
Are you listening?

777
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,793
You're looking at me but you're looking through me.

778
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,365
That's not a good feeling.

779
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,503
(soft mellow music)

780
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,744
- Is she gone?

781
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,747
- I'm still here, Lez.

782
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,616
I'm still here.

783
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,689
Lesbians are sensitive beings.

784
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,425
(soft music)

785
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,763
And intimacy is huge.

786
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,066
So I'm thinking if we spice it up with a (bleeping),

787
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,369
maybe she'll pay attention to me again.

788
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,575
I just think we should do more to reconnect.

789
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,943
- (groans) We do connect.

790
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,779
I just sent you a text.

791
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,454
- I know that Lez does this every once in awhile.

792
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,888
Acts uninterested.

793
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,458
And then she'll (bleep) bejeezus out of Abigail

794
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,894
with the big (bleep) that glows in the dark.

795
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,899
And it's not like Lez tells me her strategy.

796
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:29,934
I can just tell.

797
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,036
I'm intuitive.

798
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,005
I have a very high emotional intelligence IQ.

799
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,041
And it's not just me saying that.

800
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:41,479
My cognitive behavioral therapist thinks so too.

801
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,547
Want a rip of salvia?

802
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,884
Fine.

803
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,558
- I'm a very sensitive lover.

804
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,094
I need romance.

805
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,030
Tenderness. (sighs)

806
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,966
I love love.

807
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:04,802
- Babe.

808
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,070
- Get the (bleep) out.

809
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,705
I'm trying to (bleep) Lez.

810
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,543
(soft playful music)

811
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,185
- Hey.

812
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,820
What's wrong?

813
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,956
- I just hate when Lez takes up all of Abigail's time.

814
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:29,593
- Hey, let them go through whatever they're going through.

815
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,096
- I know, it's just that I really need her tonight.

816
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,931
I was talking to my dad earlier

817
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,233
and he does really know how to make me feel bad

818
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,768
when he wants to.

819
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,105
- He's like a traditional macho guy, huh?

820
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,175
Oppresses you with his narrow mindedness.

821
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,076
I would sure peg him.

822
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,113
[robot voice reads the text]

823
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,115
- I mean, oh, not literally.

824
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,016
Oh God, no.

825
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,285
- Oh my God.

826
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,189
- Have you ever got a song stuck in your head so bad

827
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,291
and you just want to dance?

828
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,726
When you know music.

829
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,895
(humming)

830
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,271
- You look beautiful, baby.

831
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,739
- You like that, baby boy?

832
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,075
- I do. - Come dance with me.

833
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,177
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

834
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,145
- Come. - Babe, no.

835
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,047
- Yeah, follow Mama Cuddelz.

836
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,549
- Okay. - Yeah.

837
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:27,818
- What is it?

838
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:28,819
(humming)

839
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,223
- Your narrow mindedness papa will be never free

840
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,091
the way you are, yeah.

841
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,627
(humming)

842
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,662
- I want to twirl. - Twirl.

843
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,698
- It's okay for a man to twirl, right?

844
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,233
- It's more than okay, my man.

845
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,201
If my man wants to twirl, my man is gonna twirl.

846
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,104
- Gonna twirl. - Twirl, my man, yeah.

847
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:47,972
Mm-hmm.

848
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,574
I wish your dad could see you like that.

849
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,209
- I wish my dad could see me right now.

850
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,177
I feel so free.

851
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,312
Oh my God, oh my God.

852
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,949
- I is ready and perfect.

853
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,053
Lez's turn on smell is green apple.

854
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,624
So I always have hella green apple candles on hand.

855
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,225
No excuses tonight.

856
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,327
I got everything a good sex sesh needs.

857
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,363
Homemade Gatorade, energy bars, extra batteries,

858
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,698
an EpiPen, and smelling salts.

859
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,669
(soft playful music)

860
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,072
- Oh my God.

861
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:22,973
- [Abigail] Hi, lover.

862
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,145
- You look perfect.

863
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,380
- Are you ready?

864
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,682
- Oh, I'm ready to be penetrated

865
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,251
like a teenager at a Jonas Brothers concert.

866
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,120
- Yes. - Come here.

867
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,923
- Oh my God, I'm twirling. - You look like

868
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,824
a Russian ballerina. - I know.

869
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,193
I'm masculine and yet sensitive.

870
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,095
I feel so free right now.

871
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,797
Oh my God, I love you guys.

872
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,866
I love you guys, oh my God!

873
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,271
- One of the most important things to know

874
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,906
about a polyamorous relationship

875
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,643
is that the purpose of it is responsible non-monogamy.

876
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,645
We are four responsible loving adults.

877
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,813
I mean, our relationship isn't just

878
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,915
some wild orgy every day.

879
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,687
(soft playful music)

880
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,089
- Hey, Tuck.

881
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,658
I finally got Abigail those nipple clamps

882
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,726
she's been asking me for.

883
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,927
And while I was at it,

884
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,630
I got her this thing called the Mad Dragon.

885
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,967
- What? That sounds dangerous.

886
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,268
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

887
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,769
You shouldn't touch it.

888
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,072
- Okay.

889
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,640
But what is it, anyways?

890
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,143
- I don't even know if I should tell you.

891
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,111
Should I tell you?

892
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,181
Do you want me to tell you?

893
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,783
'Cause I don't think you want me to tell you.

894
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:45,255
[robot voice reads the text]

895
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,257
- Well, I want to see it.

896
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,759
- You really want to see?

897
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,294
You're gonna pee your pants. - I want to see it.

898
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:51,328
I want to see.

899
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,163
- I don't think so. - I wanna see, I wanna see it!

900
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:54,898
- Here you go, bam!

901
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,270
- I get so angry when neighbors joke about

902
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,741
how they can't wait until when the next Romeo moves in

903
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,310
or when a creepy co-worker asks,

904
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,245
what weird sex stuff did you

905
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,813
and your 20 lovers do last night?

906
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,915
It's offensive, okay?

907
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,019
Our sex is so normal, it's almost boring.

908
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,156
- Wait, I'm trying to order some more dragon cum

909
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,824
for my little contraption.

910
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,696
Yeah, did I mention the dragon dildo cums?

911
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,033
It's kinda gross but...

912
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,702
I can't wait.

913
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,874
- I get so worked up because I love our relationship.

914
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,343
I love our dynamic, I love what we offer each other

915
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:42,246
and I don't want anybody else.

916
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,351
And that is why I am going to ask us

917
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,087
to have a commitment ceremony.

918
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,191
I already hinted at it to Tucker.

919
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,262
(squeals)

920
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,065
- Well, I've been a little nervous

921
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,333
ever since Abigail told me she has some news.

922
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,301
It didn't seem bad.

923
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,538
It's just that, well, I have the tendency

924
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,773
of having bad thoughts about things.

925
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,842
It's a thing.

926
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,410
For example, last night I had a dream

927
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,413
and the news turned out to be that

928
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,881
Cuddelz got Abigail pregnant.

929
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,817
Which I was very happy.

930
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,986
But it's just that I didn't know how to tell my parents

931
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,823
that my girlfriend got my other girlfriend pregnant.

932
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,825
It's just...

933
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,261
- Yeah, I overheard Abigail tell Tucker

934
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,896
she had some bad news.

935
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,033
I'm worried she might break up with him.

936
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,303
It's 'cause he sucks at dates.

937
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,309
- Watch your right. - Okay.

938
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,111
- To your right is a chair.

939
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,112
Okay, stop here.

940
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,485
- Oh my goodness.

941
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,387
You cooked for us.

942
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,056
- Well, I ordered but...

943
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,558
- Oh.

944
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,826
- Alcohol?

945
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,461
- Yes, please.

946
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,396
Thank you.

947
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,099
(soft music)

948
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,337
- Cranberry juice. - Yes, please.

949
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,509
(sighs) Wow.

950
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,078
(soft music)

951
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,986
- Well, hold on on that 'cause I got something else for you.

952
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:29,887
- Oh.

953
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,055
What's this?

954
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,958
Babe, my poem.

955
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,261
- I know, yeah.

956
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,830
I know it might not have won the competition

957
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:44,201
because of the good but I love it.

958
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,937
- You love my haiku about the patriarchy?

959
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:52,643
- I love when you express yourself.

960
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,378
[robot voice reads the text]

961
00:46:54,678 --> 00:47:02,920
[Abigail reads the text]

962
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,022
I wrote it out of my anger about

963
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,323
some people's small mindedness.

964
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:11,295
I mean, I love Cuddelz and I love Lez and I love you.

965
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,498
And I don't want us to ever be judged for that.

966
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,067
- Me neither, baby, and I love you for that.

967
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,139
What?

968
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:24,474
- Do the face.

969
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,943
- Babe, no.

970
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,411
No, no, no. - Come on, do the face.

971
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,478
Do the face.

972
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,081
(laughing)

973
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,921
- Wow.

974
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,324
Wow.

975
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,093
That date was terrifying.

976
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,297
Okay, where do I even begin?

977
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:49,600
The face.

978
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,201
The face.

979
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,338
I don't even think I need to say more.

980
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:56,940
And second of all,

981
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,509
he served her cranberry juice.

982
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:04,481
Cranberry juice I bought a week ago for my UTI.

983
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,217
Good job, Tucker.

984
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,020
That's real sexy.

985
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,457
And third of all, and I'm sorry to say this,

986
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,427
but that poem was terrible, okay?

987
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:21,999
It was a haiku that didn't even follow haiku rules.

988
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:28,005
Tucker, drudging up painful memories of failure.

989
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,240
He's gonna break us up.

990
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,277
He's gonna break us up.

991
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,180
(sighs)

992
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,483
- I sense something's going on, okay?

993
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,086
Hold on a sec, I have this thing here.

994
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,488
Hold on.

995
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,995
I don't like to look into the future

996
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,031
because sometimes it's like playing with fire

997
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,466
but I'm just too much on the edge.

998
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,303
So this is my pendulum, by the way.

999
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,371
And it tells me what's going on in the future.

1000
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,973
I love it with all my heart.

1001
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:07,377
[robot voice reads the text]

1002
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,516
- Goddammit, it's not gonna tell me what's going on.

1003
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:16,620
- Hmm?

1004
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,256
Am I nervous about the news?

1005
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,060
Well, the more I think about it, yeah.

1006
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,131
I don't want Tucker's stupid ideas and his stupid dates

1007
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,468
to keep us separated from each other or keep us apart.

1008
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,005
I love us.

1009
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,111
That stupid sensitive idiot.

1010
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,180
Why can't he just (bleep) Abigail

1011
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:46,049
with a (bleep) like a normal dude?

1012
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:48,485
Then there's--

1013
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,687
- This clothing. - You gotta go up.

1014
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,656
You gotta go up. - There's nothing up.

1015
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:53,757
- Guys. - Red wildflowers.

1016
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,792
Hold on one sec, one second. - It's just for the hair.

1017
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,694
- Put it, oh that's-- - Oh, I took it off.

1018
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,563
- No, but that's not the thing.

1019
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:07,137
- Okay, so I have some very, very important news.

1020
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,272
Oh my God, I'm so nervous.

1021
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,407
- Wait, wait, before you begin.

1022
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,275
Abigail, I just wanted to tell you that

1023
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:15,078
Tucker is very sorry for his ignorance

1024
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,715
and I have supplied him with an arsenal of sex toys

1025
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,151
that might help you two-- - Okay hi, Lez, Lez.

1026
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,320
Thank you but why don't you just listen

1027
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,622
to what she has to-- - No, no, you listen, okay?

1028
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,058
I am trying to save your ass.

1029
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,093
So.

1030
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,830
Okay, so I got you this big dildo.

1031
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,733
I got you this humongous dildo.

1032
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:37,868
I've got a dragon dildo.

1033
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,103
I've got a double sided dildo.

1034
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:43,540
There's a harness, I cleaned out my savings, so just--

1035
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:46,143
- [Tucker] Oh my God, why would you do that?

1036
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,744
- Because I love you.

1037
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,212
- Oh my God!

1038
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,348
That's so beautiful.

1039
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,550
- And that's not even the craziest thing I got you guys.

1040
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,854
I got you this fetish fantasy electroshock therapy set.

1041
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,323
Check it out, it's really strong.

1042
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,492
- Electricity in sex is God.

1043
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,861
Why do you think Zeus had so much sex?

1044
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,430
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1045
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,266
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna come out and say it.

1046
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,669
My babes, loves of my life...

1047
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,376
I want us to have a commitment ceremony.

1048
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,745
- Oh my God, I do, I do.

1049
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,713
- Oh my God, we're not breaking up?

1050
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,649
- No, of course not.

1051
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,554
- We need to set a date.

1052
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,890
I need to get a dress with golden dragons.

1053
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,226
It's my fantasy wedding dress.

1054
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,829
Oh my God, my baby, we need to get a bunad for you.

1055
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,364
Is Hulda Garborg still alive?

1056
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,368
We need to get the best bunad for my sweet, sweet queen.

1057
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,737
(squealing)

1058
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,605
Yeah!

1059
00:51:53,243 --> 00:52:01,184
[robot voice reads the text]

1060
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,955
(soft playful music)

1061
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:08,825
- So I was able to take back some of the sex toys.

1062
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,795
The cock rings, the double sided dildo,

1063
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,863
which I should've kept.

1064
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,165
Nope, I've got too many.

1065
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,835
I was able to take back some of them but

1066
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,403
I'm still missing a chunk of cash

1067
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,940
that could be used for our ceremony, so that kinda sucks.

1068
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,510
- I am so happy, oh my God.

1069
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,644
This is a dream.

1070
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:33,783
I want our ceremony to have live music, feasts, friends.

1071
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,288
- I'm thinking of hand carving some wood veneerings

1072
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,723
for our celebration.

1073
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,225
With precious stones.

1074
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,329
Hey, turquoise is a precious stone, right?

1075
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,833
- My dad is the kinda guy who has a portrait

1076
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,701
of John Wayne in his office.

1077
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,372
He voted for Reagan, Bush, Bush,

1078
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,340
Sarah Palin.

1079
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,409
And that's just to name a few.

1080
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,711
So am I afraid to tell my dad?

1081
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:02,679
Yes, I'm afraid.

1082
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,216
But I really want him to be our best man.

1083
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,489
- Friends, chill vibes, and maybe a forest.

1084
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,859
(gasps) Just like Rachel At The Wedding.

1085
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,327
Do you know that movie?

1086
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,896
That is such a beautiful ceremony.

1087
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,731
I want exactly that.

1088
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,500
Well, I mean except for all the depression and drugs

1089
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,635
and the killing your own sibling thing.

1090
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:28,838
Yeah.

1091
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,640
Everything but that.

1092
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,011
- Okay, I found a forest.

1093
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,881
It's in Montana, it's not safe.

1094
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,283
There are bison stampedes often.

1095
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,018
Okay, the land is so wild,

1096
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,954
they're like a lunch on the breeze in the lady.

1097
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,556
But it's full of legends.

1098
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,657
You know, myth.

1099
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,828
There's these native forest creatures called wendigos.

1100
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:58,301
[robot voice reads the text]

1101
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:03,073
- We have so many details to hammer out, but for now,

1102
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,041
we're just gonna enjoy each other intimately

1103
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,310
and have a group sex sesh.

1104
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:09,980
- Hey Cuddelz, not yet.

1105
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,482
You can't plug it in on the man's first try.

1106
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,783
- Come on, he's having so much fun.

1107
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:14,985
Don't be a downer.

1108
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,753
- [Lez] He's making the face.

1109
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,788
- Ooh, looks like fun.

1110
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,890
Hey, don't forget I'm next.

1111
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,791
Dibs.

1112
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,028
(laughs)

1113
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,797
(playful music)
