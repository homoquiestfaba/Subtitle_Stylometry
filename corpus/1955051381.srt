1
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,095
- We rolling?
- Yeah.

2
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:39,798
All right. I know
I've been a little, uh...

3
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,768
maybe a little stricter than
usual about this kind of thing.

4
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,705
But it's all for a good cause.
You just have to trust me.

5
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:49,708
Aren't you rolling? You don't even
have the damn thing plugged in.

6
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,618
I've invited some cameras

7
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,257
to film our little
sermon here today.

8
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,794
'Cause people have been asking, "what's
going on over there at heaven's veil?"

9
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,130
What are they doing
up there at that ranch?

10
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,298
"Are they being held
against their will?"

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,734
- Are you a prisoner here?
- No.

12
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,803
Are you a prisoner here? No.

13
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,806
No. Just smile for
the camera, people. Wave.

14
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,308
Give me this Bible.
This Bible...

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,912
this here book,
this is a tool, people.

16
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:32,151
And as such, it only has the
power that we ascribe to it.

17
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,952
But you,

18
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,655
you are something
much different.

19
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,658
Your body is of the earth, yes,
but you are not your body.

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,995
You are mightier
than the flesh.

21
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:48,867
We don't need no book
to tell us about the soul!

22
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:52,471
Did you see any lightning
come down out of that sky?

23
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,706
I've been put here

24
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,110
to resurrect mankind
from his fallen state

25
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:03,015
and bring the power of the etheric
realm back into his hands.

26
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:07,853
I'm gonna show you, and you,
and you, and every one of ya

27
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,989
how to push your spirit
through the veil.

28
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,292
It's a deathless reality,

29
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,061
souls aglow with the ever-real

30
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,397
eternal life!

31
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:49,494
<i>30 miles outside the town</i>
<i>of hidden lake, California,</i>

32
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,365
<i>you'll find this small ranch
known simply as the veil,</i>

33
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:56,201
<i>named by the members of</i>
<i>the heaven's veil cult,</i>

34
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,104
<i>the cult that lived</i>
<i>and died here.</i>

35
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>The FBI raided the compound</i>
<i>this morning at 8:52 am,</i>

36
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,577
<i>only to find tragedy.</i>

37
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,682
<i>Every man, woman and child in this
once-thriving community lies dead...</i>

38
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:14,920
<i>dead at the hands of their
leader, Jim Jacobs.</i>

39
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,456
- Okay, and we're out.
- Pack the Mikes.

40
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:22,094
Wait, what's that?

41
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,730
- Everybody, stay back.
- Come on! Come on!

42
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,965
Hold it! Hold it!

43
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,434
Hey, guys. Stay back.

44
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,671
Don't worry. They're not dead.
He's gonna bring them back.

45
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,304
<i>Hello?</i> I'll do it.

46
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,672
<i>What?</i>

47
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,141
<i>Sarah?</i> I said I'll do it.

48
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:18,176
I'll talk to you.

49
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,078
<i>All right. Thank you, Sarah.</i>

50
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,931
Okay. Would you do me a favor?

51
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,568
Could you run this up your
shirt and clip it right there?

52
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,104
Sorry.

53
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,106
Thanks. Okay, is that good? Yep.

54
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,108
- All right, guys.
- Quiet down, please.

55
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,646
Okay. Um...

56
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,517
why don't we start
with your name.

57
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,951
Then we can go from there.

58
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,454
Okay.

59
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,955
Um...

60
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,060
My name is Sarah hope.

61
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,096
I was... i...

62
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,566
I<i> am</i> the only li...

63
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,436
the only known survivor

64
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,471
of heaven's veil.

65
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,378
I have no idea

66
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,647
why they didn't kill me too.

67
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,820
Did your, um...

68
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,689
did your parents
die there also?

69
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,528
Uh, they must have.
I don't know.

70
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm not... I'm not sure
who my parents were.

71
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,635
I don't even know

72
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,270
my real name.

73
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,273
They named me...
they named me Sarah hope...

74
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,175
at the hospital.

75
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,711
Uh...

76
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,817
I was in foster care, a lot of
different homes, till I was 16.

77
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,624
I think this is me and my
brother and my sister.

78
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,461
But I'm not sure.
I was only five.

79
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,129
This is that really famous one,

80
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,399
the one of Jim
and his followers.

81
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,671
I know this is really hard,

82
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,375
but there is a reason why we...

83
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,512
Reached out to you.

84
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:37,449
Like I said earlier
on the phone,

85
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:42,087
we found something that no
one's ever seen before.

86
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,699
Do you see that camera
right there?

87
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,302
And right there?

88
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,972
And right there.

89
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,374
They were filming.

90
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,645
But there's no record
of anything.

91
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,413
Nothing's ever been released.

92
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,420
And there's this.

93
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,423
They never found this room.

94
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,562
Not in the farmhouse
or any of the buildings.

95
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,400
No one knows
what happened that day.

96
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,736
Why did they do it?

97
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,440
I wanna go back out there
and find those films.

98
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:38,510
Maybe we'd find out
what really happened.

99
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,380
<i>We're in this room.</i>

100
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,915
<i>We feel the silence.</i>

101
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:51,022
There is a time for
every season, mama.

102
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,826
This child has been cut
down before her time.

103
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,629
How long?

104
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:00,599
How long has your
daughter been this way?

105
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,470
Two years. Mmm.

106
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,706
The doctors say
she's brain-dead.

107
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,476
Doctors.

108
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,212
Doctors.

109
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,086
The doctors don't
want her well, mama.

110
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,122
They like that money coming in.

111
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,961
No, sir.

112
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,165
The child's mind is not dead.

113
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,067
Will you join hands with me?

114
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,672
We need to create an opening,

115
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,607
close the circuit

116
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,644
so the girl can
find her way back home.

117
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,814
Please. Indulge me.

118
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,519
Please.

119
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,727
Thank you.

120
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,865
There we go. All right.

121
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,967
Now, mama, I want
you to be brave.

122
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:12,303
Something happened before
the child got lost,

123
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,105
about a week before.

124
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,876
No. Mm-hmm.

125
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,311
No. Nothing. Not to her, mama.

126
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,180
Nothing. To you.

127
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,183
To you.

128
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,852
Something so terrible,
it froze your heart,

129
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,622
and you swore you'd never
tell a living soul.

130
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,691
But the spirit sees all.

131
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:36,294
No! The spirit knows all.
The spirit understands all.

132
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,631
Now whisper it. Whisper it to me.
Let it out.

133
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,534
No. No. Let it out.

134
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,536
Whisper.

135
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,473
Whisper it in my ear!
Give it to me!

136
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,408
Tell me the truth. The truth!

137
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,811
The real truth! Now!

138
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:05,857
He's going down! Get his head.
I got his feet.

139
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,059
Grab him. Grab him. Hold him.

140
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,062
I've got his head.
Rotate him. Look out.

141
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,096
So, how long have you
guys worked together?

142
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,032
Just long enough
to talk us into this.

143
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,769
We actually met in film school, so
we've done everything together...

144
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,238
industrials, um, web series...

145
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,974
- infomercials.
- Once. We did one infomercial.

146
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,409
"Your skin
will practically glow."

147
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,045
- That was the best payday we ever had.
- Yeah, for three days of hell.

148
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,549
Uh, excuse me. I'm pretty sure
you slept with the spokesmodel.

149
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,417
Hey, she was very smart. Oh!

150
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,287
She reads books.

151
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,957
But this film?

152
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,893
This is different.

153
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,796
We've wanted to make this
film for a long time.

154
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,165
Why is it so important to you?

155
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,699
Wait, you didn't tell her?

156
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,809
Uh, our dad, he led the
FBI team that day,

157
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,912
the day when everyone, um...

158
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,815
died.

159
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,251
Our dad was never really
the same after that.

160
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,287
Neither was our mom.

161
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,056
So that's why you have
all those photos.

162
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,226
That's why we're here.

163
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,430
Look at this guy.

164
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,214
Mr. Wheeler, hi.
Maggie, from the documentary.

165
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,483
Uh-huh. Thank you so much for
letting us shoot on your property.

166
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,159
I know this is...

167
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,245
Twenty-five years, I
kept folk away from here.

168
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,291
Who are all these folks?
Thought it was just you.

169
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,061
Oh, no, uh, this is my crew.

170
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,697
- Christian, my brother, is the editor.
- Hello, sir.

171
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,566
Nick is our gaffer.
Matt's our cameraman.

172
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,201
Ed, grip. What's up?

173
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,137
Jill does sound,
and Ann is our pa.

174
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,773
- And this is Sarah hope.
- I know who she is.

175
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,913
Thought it was you.

176
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,514
Bound to come back home.

177
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,316
Was wondering
if you ever would.

178
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,638
Oh, wow.

179
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,081
You okay?

180
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,582
Hey, hey. What?

181
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,318
Get this. Okay.

182
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,852
Get down. Get down.

183
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,461
- Oh, shit.
- Sarah! Sarah!

184
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,799
- Sarah?
- Is she okay?

185
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,101
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

186
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,172
I don't know.

187
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,408
Maybe we shouldn't be here.

188
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,746
All right,
we'll set up camp over there.

189
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,925
Thanks.

190
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:46,697
Can you imagine how weird this
must be for her to be back here?

191
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,100
She's the one that made it out.

192
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,475
My whole life has been
defined by this place,

193
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,746
by what happened.

194
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,517
It's the same for me.

195
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,723
After it all happened, I, um...

196
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,959
I was only three at the time,

197
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:18,529
but... my father, uh,

198
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,933
killed himself.

199
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,502
What?

200
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,374
I found him
hanging in the garage.

201
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,516
I thought he was
playing a game.

202
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,525
We both lost our families
because of this place.

203
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,163
I need to know why.

204
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,297
Sarah. Sarah.

205
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,576
Sarah.

206
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,601
Ed? Ed!

207
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,070
Ed! Do you see him down there?

208
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,039
- No, he's not over here.
- Ed! Ed!

209
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,342
Ed, stop messing around!

210
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,178
Sarah, have you seen ed?

211
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,747
He's gotta be around here someplace.
He left all of his stuff.

212
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,882
His wallet is right there.
He couldn't have gone far.

213
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,918
Ed, where the hell are you?

214
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,754
Ed! Ed, breakfast is ready!

215
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,389
Yeah, that should get him.

216
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,458
Maggie! I'm gonna look up front.

217
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,761
- Come take a look at this.
- <i> All right, what is it?</i>

218
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,999
I don't know.
Um, just look here.

219
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,303
Who moved the camera?

220
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,708
Look right there.

221
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,711
Look at that.
We got a ghost. Wow.

222
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:24,415
- Nick, it's not a ghost.
- You don't believe in ghosts?

223
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,484
And watch this part.

224
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,822
That's where ed was sleeping.

225
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,795
The Van's gone.

226
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,164
It's gone. What do
you mean it's gone?

227
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,499
What?

228
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,167
Let's have a look.

229
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,905
Oh, what the fuck?

230
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,475
This isn't like him. I know. He's a
grumpy fucker, but he's not a quitter.

231
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,778
We crawled through swamps with this guy.
There's no way he'd bail on us.

232
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,980
Looks like he did.
What do we do now?

233
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,983
Has anybody got any bars? I'm
trying, but I got nothing.

234
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,014
What do we do? Go back?

235
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,787
No. We have, like, 80 grand
worth of equipment in there.

236
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,656
- That's 80 grand we<i> do not</i> have.
- Yeah, exactly.

237
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,826
Well, someone's gotta
go down for some help.

238
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,866
Me?

239
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,102
Yeah. You're the pa.

240
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:21,772
You're gonna send me down there to
walk 20 miles, probably till dark?

241
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,775
Don't exaggerate. It's 16 miles.
This one.

242
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,777
Ann, it's okay. Nick will go.

243
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,881
Oh, really? Yeah.

244
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,217
Matt'll cover for you. You'll
be down before dark. Yeah.

245
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,219
Well, thanks, pal.

246
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,722
Fine. No, wait.
I'll come with you.

247
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,625
Oh. I thought
you didn't wanna go.

248
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:45,229
It's better than staying up here with
that creepy farmer guy out there.

249
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,565
All right. What?

250
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,201
Be careful.

251
00:22:48,227 --> 00:22:50,735
Yeah, I'll keep an eye
out for inbred farmers.

252
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:53,070
No, Nick, she needs to
be careful of you.

253
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,805
Oh!

254
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,440
Ow, Maggie. Ow. Stop it.

255
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,845
Let's set up the next
interview by the church.

256
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,880
You gonna need both cameras?
Yeah.

257
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,250
We need to go across the lake.

258
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,755
Hmm? Across the lake?

259
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,224
I remembered something.

260
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,658
Are you seeing this?

261
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,434
It's a strip that's shallow.

262
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,703
Come on.
Goes all the way across.

263
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,305
Let's go.

264
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,855
Sarah? Where are we going?

265
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,293
To that place.

266
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,978
And you think this is it?

267
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:45,816
I remember it now.

268
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,687
It was Jim's special place.

269
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:42,706
Ugh.

270
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,341
No lights.

271
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,733
I hate rats. Not my
favorite either.

272
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,982
Oh, I have another one
right here in my pack.

273
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,819
It's, like... it's inside, in, like,
the flashlight pouch. Right there.

274
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,861
Here they are.

275
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,697
These are the films
you were looking for.

276
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,304
Whoa! Sarah, are you okay?

277
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,141
Wha... yeah. I think
I fell through this chair.

278
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,143
What do you mean,
you fell through it?

279
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,712
My hand went through
the leather.

280
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:09,153
Oh... oh, my...

281
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,523
oh, my god!

282
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,399
Come here, Sarah.
Come here. Come here.

283
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,569
Give me your hand.

284
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:30,574
Sarah. Sarah!

285
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,409
Here we go. Fuck.

286
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:41,051
Okay. Okay. Okay.

287
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,322
Well, Maggie,

288
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:48,392
clearly nobody ever
found this place.

289
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,329
There's no way we would have found
this place if it wasn't for her.

290
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,569
What do you think?

291
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,774
We're gonna need to get
some lights on in there.

292
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,076
It's actually
in pretty good shape.

293
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,045
If it's got fuel.

294
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,713
Here we go. Careful.

295
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,654
Let's check it out.

296
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,270
- Oh! God!
- God.

297
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,541
Why don't you
try another switch?

298
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:39,810
Why don't<i> you</i>
try another switch?

299
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,416
Ugh.

300
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,658
Here they are.

301
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,494
We can watch 'em
if I can get this to work.

302
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,599
Look at this.

303
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,201
What?

304
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,869
Oh, wow.

305
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:46,710
No, no, no! Don't touch that.

306
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:50,614
I'm sorry. It's just
that it's next to a body

307
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,183
and it's probably evidence
of some kind of crime,

308
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,220
and if you touch it
with all your hands...

309
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,995
whatever is on this tape...

310
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,965
should go to the police
because it's evidence.

311
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,300
We're not gonna take it to the police.
M-maybe we should.

312
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,297
But n-not right away.

313
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:13,570
I don't really wanna
argue next to a body.

314
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,139
All right, we should...
it's entirely decomposed.

315
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,809
Okay, if you wanna enable yourself
into doing whatever you do.

316
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:39,496
That's Karen Sweetzer,
the nurse that followed Jim.

317
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,932
The one they never found.

318
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,001
<i>I got away.</i>

319
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,072
<i>They... they tried to get me.</i>

320
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,774
<i>But I got away.</i>

321
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,576
When did she record this?

322
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,379
Must be after the FBI raid.

323
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:57,948
<i>They're gonna...</i>
<i>they're gonna come get me.</i>

324
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,951
<i>They wanna control me</i>
<i>like I'm a puppet.</i>

325
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:07,457
<i>They want in, but I'm not</i>
<i>gonna let anybody in.</i>

326
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,094
<i>Do you hear that, Jim?</i>

327
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,867
<i>I will not let anybody in.</i>
<i>I didn't come here to be taken.</i>

328
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:21,805
<i>Even if they get in,</i>
<i>they won't get me.</i>

329
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,852
<i>Sarah.</i>

330
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,589
<i>I want you to...</i>

331
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:45,062
<i>ch... ch...</i>

332
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,311
sh-she looked, like, um,
drugged, you know.

333
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,780
Yeah.

334
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:07,150
She's so manic.
I mean, so paranoid.

335
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,521
What was she talking about? That the
FBI was gonna use her like a puppet?

336
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,492
She was so loyal to the end.

337
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,438
<i>I have become what never fails.</i>

338
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,876
<i>And the dead shall be</i>
<i>raised incorruptible.</i>

339
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,445
<i>And we shall be changed.</i>

340
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,355
We need to watch the
rest of those films.

341
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,327
You got the whole thing in frame?
Yeah, it looks great.

342
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,030
It works.
We just need a new bulb.

343
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,099
Sure there's a kmart around.

344
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,748
Oh, look at this.

345
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,587
"Pancuronium bromide."

346
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,322
It's for lethal injections.

347
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,591
It halts
the respiratory system.

348
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,560
Your lungs stop working.
You suffocate.

349
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,099
Hey. Hey.

350
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:32,202
Be careful with those.
They don't have needle guards.

351
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:36,039
Seriously? Why are you
touching needles?

352
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,841
Sorry. Don't touch...

353
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,124
don't touch anything. Sorry. I
wasn't gonna touch the top.

354
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,649
Jim's room.

355
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,453
Seems about right.

356
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,589
Ugh.

357
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,591
Fuck station partridge family.

358
00:34:57,396 --> 00:35:00,030
Why don't we just go back
down to the compound,

359
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,532
wait for Nick and Ann,
figure everything out there?

360
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,868
How about we just look
for the projector bulbs?

361
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,636
Sorry.

362
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,518
Projector bulb!

363
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,989
Okay, I loaded up
the earliest film.

364
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:29,292
- All right. Rolling.
- Here we go.

365
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,233
All right, is it filming?

366
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,335
Uh, yeah, I hear it.

367
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,838
Well, when we get
the new cameras

368
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,441
we'll be able
to check it right away.

369
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,977
And how are they different?

370
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,112
Uh, they're new video cameras.

371
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:53,683
You can buy the tapes
at the supermarket... $24.99.

372
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:58,155
You don't have to send it all
in to Kodak and... i-i...

373
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:04,094
- okay, Jim.
- Whenever you're ready.

374
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,298
This is film number one.

375
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,702
I'm Jim Jacobs, and we are
here at heaven's veil ranch.

376
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,672
It's December 11, 1982.

377
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,975
When we started here,
there was just a few of us.

378
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:22,546
Small group of seven. A family.

379
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:28,351
There's a small town
in Indiana.

380
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,722
Whenever I think of it,
a great deal of pain comes.

381
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,959
As a child, I was undoubtedly
one of the poor.

382
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,861
Never accepted.

383
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,264
Born, as it were, on the
wrong side of the tracks.

384
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,568
And when I was very small,

385
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:49,172
I lost my father and my mother
to an unholy fire, they tell me.

386
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:54,477
I knew too early the pain of
suffering, the pain of loss.

387
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:59,716
But tragedy
can beget transformation.

388
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,852
I believe that mankind

389
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,256
is on the cusp
of a new reality,

390
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,660
one that transcends
pain, suffering,

391
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,229
even death.

392
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,366
I've discovered
that the spiritual nature

393
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,836
is attached to the human form
at certain points,

394
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,606
represented by the three
nails of the crucifixion.

395
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,709
And by three
alchemical initiations,

396
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,545
I can now draw these nails

397
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,847
and permit
the divine nature of man

398
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,116
to come down from its cross.

399
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,086
I can release the nails

400
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,455
that pin the spirit to the body

401
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:41,925
and free the soul
from its mortal coil.

402
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,629
Jim is in a meditative state.

403
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,365
Once he reaches full trance,

404
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:51,601
he will leave his body
in the physical form

405
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:55,672
and he'll manifest himself
in spirit in this room.

406
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,442
Father?

407
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,314
Father, are you here?

408
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,820
Father, if you are here,

409
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,957
reach out to us.

410
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,236
Reach out to us, Jim.

411
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,619
Jim?

412
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,288
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Jim, come back to us.

413
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,023
Jim, come back to us. Focus.

414
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,792
There you go.

415
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,661
There you go. Slow, controlled.

416
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,331
Okay. That's good.

417
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,333
Mommy. Mommy. What happened?

418
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,802
Sarah. Come here.

419
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,937
Okay. Is he okay?

420
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,808
Yeah, he's okay. What are you doing up?
I was playing, mom.

421
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,943
Okay, come. Time to go to bed.

422
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,624
She was my mom.

423
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,795
Karen Sweetzer was...

424
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,877
so horrible.

425
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,213
I mean... ugh.

426
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,582
So sad for her,
and so gruesome.

427
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,818
You know?

428
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,188
I just think, deep down,

429
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,190
maybe she was hoping

430
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,726
her mom was still alive

431
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,395
somewhere.

432
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,188
Mom.

433
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,659
I guess you were my mom.

434
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,492
I am so sorry
this happened to you.

435
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,128
I feel like...

436
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,434
like something

437
00:41:11,436 --> 00:41:13,336
wanted me to come back here,

438
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:18,208
to bring them here
with me, but I...

439
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,911
something about it
feels so wrong.

440
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,488
Sarah! Sarah?

441
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,690
Sarah!

442
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:36,659
What happened?

443
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,628
What happened?

444
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,830
What happened?

445
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,005
What happened?

446
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,074
Nothing happened.

447
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,344
Nothing happened.

448
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,118
- Help us! Help!
- Matt!

449
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,054
- Please!
- Guys! We need help!

450
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,223
- Do you hear that?
- It's Nick.

451
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:08,791
Help!

452
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,794
- Maggie!
- Maggie!

453
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,163
Ann? Maggie!

454
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,900
What is it? What?

455
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,434
Ed.

456
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,741
- Oh, god.
- Oh, my god.

457
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,145
Oh. He must have been doing 90.

458
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,014
I guess he missed that curve.

459
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:34,017
- Why was he going so fast?
- Someone was in the car with him.

460
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,086
No one was in the car with him.
That doesn't make any sense.

461
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:40,189
What are you talking about?
Who was in the car with him?

462
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,357
Go ahead. Tell her your theory.

463
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,326
The other air bag blew. Look!

464
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,428
It doesn't matter though.

465
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,232
One blows, they both blow.
That's how it works.

466
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,200
Besides, who's
gonna come up here?

467
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:55,438
Someone hiked 16 miles to steal a shitty
Van, and ed gives his life to stop 'em?

468
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,675
Goddamn it, you guys.
I can't believe this.

469
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,512
Did you... did you check him?

470
00:43:02,514 --> 00:43:04,647
I mean, he's for sure dead?
Yeah.

471
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,786
- Are you sure?
- Feel free to check him again, Maggie.

472
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,843
- Oh, god.
- Shit.

473
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,147
So we go to the cops, right?
Yes.

474
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,618
Yes, we go to the cops when we can. There's
no way we can make it there by dawn.

475
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,820
And that farmer's still out there.
Seriously?

476
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:46,356
Farmer John
did not kill ed, okay?

477
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,593
It's 12 miles
down to the main road,

478
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,263
and then it's another 20 miles
to, like, the nearest anything.

479
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:57,500
Do you guys wanna
walk down in the dark, or...

480
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,505
what about ed?

481
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:14,684
Oh, god.

482
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,538
We'll leave in the morning.

483
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,074
Yeah.

484
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:45,915
Do you remember
your mom at all?

485
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:48,551
I can't remember.

486
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,289
I did always feel
like she wanted me back,

487
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,427
for us to be a family again.

488
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:00,963
Maybe it's just

489
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,099
wishful thinking.

490
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:09,205
I don't know, I...

491
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:12,442
I do feel like the answers
are in that house.

492
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:14,977
I do too.

493
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,316
You wanna go back?

494
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,354
I do.

495
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:27,356
Maggie, I thought we just
decided that we were leaving.

496
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,358
We are. In the morning.

497
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,962
We're gonna go back to the
house and watch those films.

498
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,732
Who's coming with?

499
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,102
Christian, come on.

500
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,404
Yeah, no, I was coming.
I was totally coming.

501
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,307
Anyone else?

502
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,115
All right. I guess, uh, see
you guys in the morning.

503
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,920
Seriously?

504
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,590
You guys aren't
a little curious?

505
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:04,127
No. Not really.

506
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,797
Wait up.

507
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:12,602
All right, well,
I'm not babysitting.

508
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,641
Nick, wait. Oh, come on.

509
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:28,050
Hey, I know you guys are really tired,
but I kinda need one more thing.

510
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,789
- Can you grab some b-roll for me?
- Now?

511
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,123
Please.

512
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,000
You are obsessed.

513
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:51,207
Look, Maggie, how far
are we gonna go with this?

514
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:56,946
We lost our family
because of this.

515
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,247
So did she.

516
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,853
So as far as we need to. Right?

517
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,421
Okay.

518
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:16,065
We good? Yeah.

519
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:23,806
To be released and come back.

520
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:27,543
Released and come back.

521
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,313
This is the loop
that we must close.

522
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,215
I must journey
to the other side,

523
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,350
where I will extract
the first nail,

524
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,286
and then I must return
through the golden door...

525
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:41,457
into my body.

526
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:46,495
Karen is preparing
the first injection.

527
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:50,066
It's a little cocktail
of my own making.

528
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,568
There's some luminous ether
in there, some bismuth...

529
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,573
sodium pentothal.

530
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,279
Some Mercury.

531
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:07,550
Yes, it's quite poisonous.

532
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:10,086
Why did you create
this drug, Jim?

533
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,688
Um,

534
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,691
I'm having trouble...

535
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,562
I'm having trouble conjugating.

536
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,298
Re-conjugating.

537
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,934
Re-conjugating?

538
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:36,312
Do you hear that?

539
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:41,450
Yeah. I can't see
where it's coming from.

540
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,786
It's not from the film.

541
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,589
Could be from another room?

542
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,126
Communicate with us.

543
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:52,461
We're here for you.
Push through, Jim.

544
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,097
Push through.
Come through to us.

545
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,200
Push through, Jim.
Push through.

546
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,841
Hello, brothers and sisters.

547
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,077
It's a beautiful day.

548
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,379
Jim, is that you?

549
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,587
The body is nothing
but a shell.

550
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:56,525
A cycle of physical ego

551
00:49:57,762 --> 00:50:01,864
for us to outgrow and discard

552
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,532
as we please.

553
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,955
The first nail is ours.

554
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,563
Now what?

555
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,740
I'm not staying in here.

556
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,744
What do you think?
I don't know.

557
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,450
Oh, shit. Spark plug's fried.

558
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,821
I don't even think they
make this kind anymore.

559
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,757
I think I saw some spark
plugs in the pantry.

560
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,826
Great.

561
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,600
No, no, I'll go.

562
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,271
Thank you, Nick.

563
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:16,872
Thank you, Nick.

564
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,275
Yeah, I'll say hi
to Jim for ya.

565
00:51:19,277 --> 00:51:21,544
They look like this.

566
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,180
Oh, like a spark plug?
Yeah, thanks, Matt.

567
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,538
Somebody here?

568
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,330
Okay, if there's somebody here,

569
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,832
show yourself.

570
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:11,020
All right, look.

571
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:15,925
We're not here
to hurt you, okay?

572
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:24,400
What do you want?

573
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:26,835
<i>Sarah.</i>

574
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,704
I said, what do you want?

575
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,430
What's taking him so long?

576
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,601
Hey, Maggie.

577
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,683
If we can fix the generator,
we're going home, right?

578
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,840
Where's Sarah?

579
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,911
- Sarah!
- Sarah?

580
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,718
Nick! Sarah?

581
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,420
We don't have time for this.

582
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,289
Nick, stop dicking around.

583
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,691
Nick, come on.
This isn't funny, man.

584
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,067
- He went out to the Gennie.
- Jesus!

585
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,637
Sarah, you scared
the shit out of me.

586
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,113
It just... it just came back on.
I didn't even touch it.

587
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,815
Yeah, it was a breaker inside.

588
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,791
I really don't wanna go back inside.
It's just too...

589
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,493
too weird?

590
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,762
Too creepy? Too scary?
Nick! Stop.

591
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,397
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.

592
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,898
Come here.

593
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:25,054
Uh, we should probably go...

594
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,365
let's use this one.

595
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,000
Was that from march of '80?

596
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,669
Yeah. Where the hell
are Ann and Nick?

597
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,806
Right here.

598
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:46,475
Oh, hey.

599
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:49,478
Can you please take these Mikes
and put 'em in the other rooms?

600
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,313
I wanna see what we can pick up.
Sure.

601
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,681
No problem.

602
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,117
Great. Thanks.

603
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,019
Turn 'em on. I just
changed the batteries.

604
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,887
You got it.

605
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:09,198
<i>To be released and come back...</i>

606
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,970
<i>I have refined the formula to take
us further to the other side.</i>

607
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:19,108
The venom from the African black
mamba is a potent neurotoxin.

608
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,878
Mixed with pancuronium bromide,

609
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,981
which is a lethal agent used
to execute death row inmates.

610
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:28,717
Just two drops

611
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,322
will stop the heart
in 60 seconds.

612
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:36,592
After six minutes, brain death.

613
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:40,028
Without an antidote,
the death rate is 100%.

614
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,201
This is the antidote.

615
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,537
This will bring Jim back to us.

616
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:53,075
Now, do not,
under any circumstances,

617
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:57,045
administer the antidote
before the full six minutes.

618
00:56:57,047 --> 00:56:59,014
Set the timer, Sam.

619
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:03,786
Long enough
to dance with death,

620
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,355
not so long as to marry her.

621
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,037
He had an antidote.

622
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,375
- Would that even work?
- It could.

623
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,877
If done in time.

624
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,449
Jim?

625
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,818
Jim, speak to us.

626
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,121
Jim, speak to us.

627
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,658
Oh, my god, Jim.

628
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,627
I don't have a heartbeat, Karen.
Oh, god.

629
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,329
Jim, come on.

630
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:49,465
- Give him the antidote now!
- Use the antidote!

631
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,834
Wait. He said
to wait six minutes.

632
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:53,735
- Don't wait! Do it now!
- Jim, hang on, okay?

633
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,804
You're so close.

634
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,222
Jim!

635
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:18,327
Jim.

636
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,295
Jim. It's me.

637
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,531
Karen. It's me. I
thought we lost you.

638
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,600
Karen. Oh, my...

639
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:28,971
my brothers, we have
removed the second nail.

640
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:31,940
I have been reborn.

641
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,842
I have been reborn.

642
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:39,381
My brothers, sisters,
I must confess.

643
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:42,551
I'm not strong enough
to go back there on my own.

644
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,794
- Now we know.
- Yeah, he's a fucking psycho.

645
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:55,564
It wasn't suicide.

646
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,133
- They had an antidote.
- Why didn't they use it?

647
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,701
Something must have gone wrong.

648
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:03,539
They didn't plan to die.

649
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,507
Yeah, they all thought
that they were coming back.

650
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,210
Jesus, this is
such a load of shit.

651
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:12,147
Let's see if there's
anything on the Mikes.

652
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,186
This is from
the living room Mike.

653
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:23,525
<i>Oh, my... my brothers, we have
removed the second nail.</i>

654
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,160
<i>I have been reborn.</i>

655
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:28,363
<i>I've been reborn.</i>

656
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,999
This is track two, dining room.

657
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,676
Three, hallway.

658
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,851
Four, camera room.

659
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,810
Guys, what the fuck was that?

660
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:16,912
It's haunted!
This place is haunted!

661
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,780
Enough is enough, Maggie.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

662
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,616
We will, I promise.

663
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,384
But we just... but what, Maggie?

664
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,386
Let's just load up
our shit and go.

665
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,321
Why are we still
talking about this?

666
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,825
- But we're so close.
- Close? Close to what, Maggie?

667
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,493
We can't leave.

668
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:35,263
What do you think we should do?

669
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,399
You begged me to come here.

670
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,468
I didn't want to.

671
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:42,704
You said that
we would find answers.

672
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:46,875
Well, now I have actually
seen my family.

673
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:51,947
You can leave.

674
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:55,117
You can all leave,
but I am staying

675
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,686
until I find out why
I was the one who survived.

676
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,192
- Jill, please.
- Maggie, I love you. I do. I just...

677
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:06,995
you can keep all my sound stuff.
I ju...

678
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,232
you know what? When I get down,
I'll call for some help.

679
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,772
Um, you guys are good
with the cameras?

680
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:20,175
- Matt?
- Somebody's gotta go with her, Maggie.

681
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,414
Shit.

682
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,817
Let's digitize
the rest of the films,

683
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,352
and we'll leave at sunrise.

684
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:31,787
Okay.

685
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:44,766
Okay, I just need
to get this on camera.

686
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:50,038
Have you heard
those voices before?

687
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,575
Why didn't you tell us, Sarah?

688
01:01:58,348 --> 01:02:00,248
Would you have believed me?

689
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:03,885
What do you wanna do?

690
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:08,090
I think we should talk to them.

691
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:19,634
Okay.

692
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:26,608
Mom.

693
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:31,913
Can you speak to us?

694
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,156
I know you're here.

695
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:07,783
<i>I'm here.</i>

696
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:10,152
I'm here.

697
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,122
So talk to me.

698
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:19,628
You wanted me. Here I am.

699
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,633
Bring them to us.

700
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:26,902
I've tried.

701
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:29,971
Sarah. I need you.

702
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:37,479
As soon as I get home, I'm gonna give
my résumé to the game show network.

703
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:40,982
You know Maggie. She's not coming down
till she gets exactly what she wants.

704
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,351
Girl's like a dog with a bone.
Shit!

705
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:45,153
Jill? Jill? Hey, wait, wait!

706
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,789
Jill!

707
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,424
Where did he go?

708
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,426
Ed? Where did he go?

709
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:53,495
Oh, my god.

710
01:03:54,865 --> 01:03:56,665
Oh, god.

711
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,170
Matt? Yeah?

712
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:04,472
I think maybe...

713
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,441
oh, my god! Ed!

714
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:10,212
Shit! Oh, my gosh!

715
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:13,515
He's gushing blood from his neck. You
gotta hold... hold the wound right there.

716
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,952
I'm gonna go get something out of my bag.
Put your hand here and hold tight, okay?

717
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,520
It's okay, ed. It's okay.

718
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:22,691
- Hold it tight, Matt!
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.

719
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,397
Hurry the fuck up!

720
01:04:23,423 --> 01:04:25,393
I got it, I got it. Okay.
We're gonna switch.

721
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,996
One, two, three, go.

722
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:31,233
I thought he was dead.
Sarah checked him, right?

723
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:33,802
Look, all that matters is
that we need to get help.

724
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:36,504
I need you to go and get the paramedics.
I can handle this.

725
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,039
All right? Okay.

726
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,641
Go! Okay!

727
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:40,976
Okay.

728
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,811
I need you to hold this, okay?

729
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:45,680
Can you put your hand there? Just gonna
get something to tie it off, okay?

730
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:48,984
I'll be back.

731
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:52,320
Okay. Hang on, ed. One second.

732
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,856
Okay.

733
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:58,860
I'm coming. I'm coming
back, all right? Shit.

734
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:02,197
Help!

735
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:10,505
Stop!

736
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:14,276
Help! Please!

737
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,124
Sarah!

738
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,826
Sarah!

739
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,697
Sarah!

740
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,033
Where are you?

741
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,842
<i>I came back.</i>

742
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,677
<i>Like you asked me to.</i>

743
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,946
<i>Here I am.</i>

744
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:16,064
Sarah!

745
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,708
Sarah!

746
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,176
Fuck!

747
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,152
Christian.

748
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,821
Christian?

749
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,964
Christian, why didn't
you answer me?

750
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,733
You gotta see this.

751
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:09,477
Jesus was nailed to the cross.

752
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,647
He wasn't bound.

753
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,649
He was nailed.

754
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:18,953
The spirit

755
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:21,322
is not bound to the body.

756
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,791
It is nailed.

757
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,027
Thank you, my darling.

758
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:29,764
It won't give up
its fleshy domain easily.

759
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:34,536
But if we release the nails,

760
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:37,172
we forge a new reality.

761
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:42,377
A deathless world,
a new dawn for mankind.

762
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:49,450
But, Jim, certainly,
the children don't...

763
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,919
you know, Karen,

764
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:55,190
in German, the word for "death"

765
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:56,624
is<i> Heimgehen.</i>

766
01:09:57,494 --> 01:10:01,462
It means "going home."

767
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:03,798
What better place
for the children

768
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,668
than at home?

769
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,836
The task that we
have set before us

770
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,905
is one of the most challenging

771
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:14,475
that any group of human beings
has ever had to face.

772
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:17,579
It is a task which requires

773
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:19,981
a perfect faith.

774
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,916
Devotion? No.

775
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:24,819
A lifetime of devotion
is not enough.

776
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:28,256
One must have direct experience

777
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,492
of the power of spirit.

778
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:34,062
Isn't it curious?

779
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,664
The same tool we use
to pound the nails in,

780
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:39,367
we also use
to draw the nails out.

781
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:41,502
How funny.

782
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,841
I release the spirit within!

783
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,910
I release the god inside!

784
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:52,413
I give birth to the spirit,
and birth is bloody,

785
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,216
and birth is painful,
and there is blood,

786
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:59,554
and there is pain, and you are
born into everlasting life!

787
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:01,556
Stop, Jim! Stop it. Sto...

788
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:04,058
back! Get back, I say!

789
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:08,096
Rise up with your spirit
and feel pain no more.

790
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:13,101
And be released into eternity!

791
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:16,271
Arise!

792
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,877
Arise.

793
01:11:32,155 --> 01:11:35,290
Yes. Arise.

794
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,726
Yes! The third nail's ours.

795
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,296
Ours for the taking!

796
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:44,332
And immortality
is yours, brother.

797
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,668
Forever.

798
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,070
Yes.

799
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,479
Will you follow me?

800
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:04,419
Holy fucking shit.

801
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:06,587
He's not a fake.

802
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:09,698
He could really...

803
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:11,784
You said we came all
this way for answers.

804
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,862
Shouldn't we finish?

805
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:29,911
Time has come to extract
the last ethereal nail.

806
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:36,918
Time will mean nothing to us.

807
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:42,857
We'll watch galaxies
spin like pinwheels.

808
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,060
Sam.

809
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,900
Set the timer to six minutes.

810
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,311
Just a spoonful
of sugar, children.

811
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,755
Now we will all journey
to the other side.

812
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:15,890
I will be your guide.

813
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,060
And since I cannot
bring you all back at once,

814
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:23,698
we will use the antidote that
brought me back my first time.

815
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,567
And when we return
to our bodies,

816
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,371
we will have a power
without measure,

817
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,540
as you witnessed within me.

818
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,943
And we will use
this power wisely

819
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:41,048
to release every soul
from its mortal coil.

820
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,583
Sam.

821
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,686
<i>Without death in our lives,</i>

822
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,722
<i>there's no need for fear.</i>

823
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,891
Children.

824
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,894
No! No. Give me the cubes.
Give them to me.

825
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:55,196
Don't put them in your mouth.
Don't eat them.

826
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,467
Sister. Sister.

827
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,436
Be calm, sister.

828
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:03,738
Tormented and frightened
is your soul.

829
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,108
Please don't do this
to our children, Jim.

830
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,709
You're their father.

831
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,346
Jim's your dad.

832
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,218
Should we abandon our path?

833
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,920
No! No.

834
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:23,424
How many times
must I die for you, Karen?

835
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,526
Please, Jim, I'm scared.

836
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:32,467
<i>"Matthew said, " and fear not
them which kill the body,</i>

837
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:35,236
<i>but are not able</i>
<i>to kill the soul."</i>

838
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:37,772
Jim. No, Jim, no!

839
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,640
Jim!

840
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,843
Kids, don't eat them. No, Jim!

841
01:14:41,845 --> 01:14:44,579
Children, I love you.

842
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:47,515
Now, do as I say.

843
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:49,150
No! Kids, don't do it.

844
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,652
Kids, don't eat them.

845
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,088
Jim, stop.
No, kids, don't eat them.

846
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,257
Sam, get the antidote ready!

847
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:58,493
- No!
- Silence!

848
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,896
Sam! Continue, children.

849
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,433
Jim, no! No!

850
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,504
We don't have to do this!

851
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:12,673
Return!

852
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:16,711
Now, mama, please. Mama,
please, please don't do this.

853
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:19,380
Don't do this.
There's nothing to death.

854
01:15:19,382 --> 01:15:21,716
It's just a crossing over
to another plane.

855
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:24,218
Please, mama, please.

856
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,626
We shall all rise up,

857
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:36,898
and we will rub the dust of a
thousand years from our eyes.

858
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,600
Sarah, come on.

859
01:15:41,404 --> 01:15:44,071
Jim! She's getting away!

860
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,541
Sarah, run and hide! Run!

861
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,042
Hide!

862
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:49,410
Jim!

863
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:53,014
Those who will not follow
shall be carried.

864
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:56,551
Stop!

865
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,753
Stop!

866
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,255
No!

867
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:05,326
This is my body.

868
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:07,395
This is my blood.

869
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,096
No!

870
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,833
Shh.

871
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:15,169
She is the flame of life,

872
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,238
the power of darkness.

873
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,241
Let her go.

874
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:24,178
Sarah!

875
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,347
Sarah!

876
01:16:27,283 --> 01:16:28,783
Brothers,

877
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:31,285
sisters.

878
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:35,089
<i>And fear not them</i>
<i>which kill the body...</i>

879
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:41,195
<i>shocked to realize...</i>

880
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:45,199
supreme desire, supreme deity.

881
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,838
Supreme change.

882
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,182
There is no joy
without suffering.

883
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:06,654
Be ready
with the antidote, Sam.

884
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:13,227
<i>What is it that we bury</i>
<i>in the tomb of the...</i>

885
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,141
Sam, the children,
the children.

886
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,477
Please. The antidote. Do it now.

887
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:32,013
Come on. Come on. Come on.

888
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:34,582
Come on. Stay away
from the children!

889
01:17:34,584 --> 01:17:36,384
I'm not killing her!

890
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:46,293
No! No, Sam!

891
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:47,728
The children!

892
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:52,566
Sam! No, Sam, please!

893
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:57,405
Please.

894
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,981
Get away from the children!
Put your hands behind your head!

895
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:11,452
You'll rise. You'll rise again.
Please.

896
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:15,456
Rise, children! Get up and put
your hands behind your head, now!

897
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,458
Your hands where
we can see 'em!

898
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:21,962
What have you done?

899
01:18:21,964 --> 01:18:24,999
What have<i> you</i> done, sir?

900
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:27,068
You think you bar the way?

901
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,704
You only inflame my wrath!

902
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,706
Your children!

903
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:35,976
Your children's children
will be subsumed!

904
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:38,846
You all will be subsumed!

905
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:41,415
No one will escape my wrath!

906
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:45,586
You all!

907
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,094
The FBI agent...

908
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,531
that was my dad.

909
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:35,269
He was the one that...

910
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,972
who let all those people die.

911
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:39,874
All of them.

912
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,610
I mean...

913
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:47,047
none of them... no.

914
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:48,916
They wouldn't have.

915
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:52,286
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

916
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,498
I wanna be with you.

917
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:49,443
Wait for me.

918
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:06,360
They've been here, waiting

919
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,297
for me to come back.

920
01:21:10,299 --> 01:21:12,867
They need you, all of you.

921
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,802
They have to.

922
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:17,338
What the fuck
are you talking about?

923
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,673
New vessels

924
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:22,810
to continue on in...

925
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:24,712
In eternity.

926
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:28,682
Maggie, like Jim said...

927
01:21:28,684 --> 01:21:31,085
there is no joy
without suffering.

928
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,758
Brother, sister,

929
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,863
the sins of the father
now laid upon the children.

930
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:45,199
I don't know
what's happening here,

931
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,834
but we're gonna
get out of here.

932
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:49,670
- Let's go, Christian.
- Christian's gone, Maggie.

933
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:51,772
It's time for you to join us.

934
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:54,575
- Christian?
- It's amazing, Maggie.

935
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:56,076
You'll see.

936
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:59,914
After all,

937
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:03,117
who wouldn't want
everlasting life?

938
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,587
Aaah!

939
01:22:06,589 --> 01:22:08,322
Get the fuck off me!

940
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,618
No! Please, no!

941
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:41,422
It wasn't his fault!

942
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:43,657
He didn't know!

943
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:45,659
<i>I</i> didn't know.

944
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,500
Why is this happening?

945
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,236
Why?

946
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,147
Release the body...

947
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:17,251
that pins the spirit,

948
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:22,156
that frees the soul
from its mortal coil.

949
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:25,826
My will be done.

950
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:10,604
Ed?

951
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,040
Jill? Maggie!

952
01:25:18,714 --> 01:25:20,647
Don't worry.

953
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:23,150
They're not dead.

954
01:25:23,152 --> 01:25:24,985
He's gonna bring them back.

955
01:25:29,258 --> 01:25:32,459
No. No.

956
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,095
You okay? Mr. Williams,
you all right?

957
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,797
Yeah. Yeah.

958
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:56,950
The veil has been lifted,
and the fallen shall rise.

959
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:13,133
Children of the void,
sons of chaos,

960
01:26:13,135 --> 01:26:15,769
it is the last hour.

961
01:26:15,771 --> 01:26:18,539
The hebdomad is complete.

962
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:23,343
We have been remade
by Yaldabaoth

963
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,846
in the image
of the seven Archons

964
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:30,350
who created and enslaved
this world.

965
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,020
We are the hidden masters.

966
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:36,223
We are the architects
of anarchy.

967
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:42,162
We are the dark
fucking soul eaters,

968
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:44,865
lords of the unrighteous.

969
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:47,634
Today our new reign

970
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,704
begins in a new reality!

971
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,540
I told you! I told you!

972
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,377
I told you we'd be deathless!

973
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:02,182
We just, uh, need new shells
from time to time

974
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:04,985
and plenty of souls to eat.

975
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:09,523
Our legion will rise

976
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:11,658
from behind the veil

977
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:15,028
to reap the pain
that we have wrought!

978
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:18,865
The seven shall become
a vast multitude.

979
01:27:18,867 --> 01:27:22,769
These are the days
of vengeance and wrath!

980
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:27,274
The deathless eon has begun!

981
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,411
It's a beautiful day.
