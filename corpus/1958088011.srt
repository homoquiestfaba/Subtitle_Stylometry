00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:04,274
(The Billionaire Theme)

2
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:30,000
- [Secretary] Your client is here, sir.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,301
- Oh, please, send him in.

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,176
- Are you Julius Sagamore,
the worthless nephew

5
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:42,879
of my late Solicitor Pontifex Sagamore?

6
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:45,949
- Well, I don't advertise
myself as worthless,

7
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,551
but yes, Pontifex was my uncle

8
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:49,786
and I've returned from Philadelphia

9
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,287
to inherit as much of his business

10
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,923
as I can persuade his
clients to trust me with.

11
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,992
- I've heard him speak of you

12
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:58,795
and as you had been packed
off to Philadelphia,

13
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,698
I naturally concluded that
you must be worthless.

14
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:06,503
But it doesn't matter, my
business is very simple.

15
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:07,937
I wish to make my will,

16
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:11,074
leaving everything I possess to my spouse.

17
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:14,110
You can hardly go wrong
with that, I suppose.

18
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,212
- I shall do the best I can.

19
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:17,180
Please, have a seat.

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,181
- No, I feel restless.

21
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,617
I shall sit down when I feel tired.

22
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:23,620
- As you wish, but in
order to draw up a will,

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,089
I will first need to
know who your spouse is.

24
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:29,192
- My spouse is a fool and a loser.

25
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,461
You will state that fact in the will!

26
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,163
You will add that it was his conduct

27
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,665
that drove me to commit suicide.

28
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:37,600
- His conduct?

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,768
I'm not sure I follow.

30
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:40,403
- What don't you follow?

31
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:43,106
That my spouse is a man, and
that this is the year 2017

32
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:45,675
in the United States of America?

33
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:49,079
Are you as homophobic and
ignorant as you are worthless?

34
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,748
Love is supposed to win in this country,

35
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:54,484
even if it didn't within
the context of my marriage.

36
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:56,419
- I'm afraid you have it all wrong.

37
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,188
I haven't the slightest
trouble understanding

38
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:00,056
that love wins in the good old USA.

39
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:02,892
My own brother has officiated
many same sex weddings.

40
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:05,795
What I don't follow is
how your spouse's conduct

41
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,298
has driven you to commit suicide when,

42
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,533
unless I'm addressing a ghost,

43
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,736
you haven't committed suicide.

44
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:15,171
- I shall have, when the will is signed.

45
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:18,174
- Of course, quite so.

46
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,776
How stupid of me.

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,610
His name?

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,645
- His name is Alexander Fitzfassenden.

49
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:24,914
- What?

50
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,983
The amateur tennis champion and boxer?

51
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:28,451
- Do you know him?

52
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,588
- We swim together at the
same club every morning.

53
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,557
- The acquaintance does you little credit.

54
00:02:34,557 --> 00:02:36,726
- I had no idea you were
the other Mr. Fitzfassenden.

55
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:39,629
- Do not refer to me by
that abominable name of his.

56
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,466
Put me in your books as
Victor Ognisanti di Parerga.

57
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:47,837
- Well, I am very honored indeed.

58
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,139
Pray, be seated.

59
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,908
- Sit down yourself and don't fuss.

60
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:53,977
- Certainly, if that's what you prefer.

61
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,916
You know, your father was
a really wonderful man.

62
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,887
- My father was the
greatest man in the world.

63
00:03:05,121 --> 00:03:06,189
And he died a pauper.

64
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,192
I shall never forgive the world for that.

65
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:10,026
- A pauper?

66
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:12,462
You amaze me.

67
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,330
It was reported that he
left you, his only child,

68
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,999
$2.3 billion.

69
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,968
- Well, what was $2.3 billion to him?

70
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:21,037
He lost 10.4 billion.

71
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:24,340
He had promised to leave me 15 billion.

72
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,609
I was left with a beggarly 2.3.

73
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,245
It broke his heart.

74
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:32,916
- Still, an income of almost 90 million.

75
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:35,752
- Where did you get that from?

76
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:39,122
I have barely 50 million a year!

77
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,024
Do you know what that
means to a boy brought up

78
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,493
on an income of 10 figures?

79
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,128
The humiliation of it!

80
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:48,331
- I never thought I'd say this
to a member of my own sex,

81
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,966
but you take my breath away, sir.

82
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,468
- As I am about to take
my own breath away,

83
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:55,405
I have no time to attend to yours.

84
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,507
- Oh, the suicide, I almost forgot.

85
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:59,342
- Had you indeed?

86
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,878
Well, will you please give
your mind to it for a moment,

87
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:03,313
and draw up a will for me to sign,

88
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:06,049
leaving everything to Alexander?

89
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,250
- To humiliate him?

90
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,084
- No.

91
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,787
To ruin him.

92
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:12,722
To destroy him.

93
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,724
To make him a beggar on horseback

94
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,526
so that he may ride to the devil!

95
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:20,730
Money goes to his head, I
have seen it at work on him!

96
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,100
- Yeah, I've seen that
happen to many other clients.

97
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,370
But you can't be sure.

98
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,140
He may marry some sensible fellow.

99
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,975
- You are right.

100
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,878
Make it a condition of the inheritance

101
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:36,713
that within a month from my funeral

102
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:40,116
he marries a lowly man called Thonghunter.

103
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,485
- Funny name.

104
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,555
- Oh, his real name is Hector Rodriguez.

105
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:48,091
But he calls himself
"Thonghunter" on social media,

106
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:52,562
and his emails to Alexander
are also signed Thonghunter,

107
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:54,731
as a hint, I suppose, that he wants Alex

108
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,866
to buy him another dozen.

109
00:04:56,866 --> 00:04:58,401
It's disgusting!

110
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,503
- Well, I should like to
meet this Thonghunter.

111
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:01,938
I mean, Hector.

112
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,473
- Why in the world?

113
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,741
I thought you were straight,

114
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:09,679
or do you secretly fall
elsewhere on the Kinsey scale?

115
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,382
- Well, if Alex prefers Hector to you,

116
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,317
he must certainly be worth knowing.

117
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,619
I shall have Alex introduce me.

118
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,489
- I am sorry that you wish
to add yet another loser

119
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:22,425
to your circle of
friends, Julius Sagamore.

120
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,160
- Well, my friends and I wont matter

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,328
once you've taken this.

122
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:27,864
- What's this?

123
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:29,165
- Oh, for the suicide.

124
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:32,001
One sip of that will kill
you like a thunderbolt.

125
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:36,339
- You seem to take my death
very coolly, Mister Sagamore.

126
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:37,607
- I'm used to it.

127
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,441
- Do you mean to tell me

128
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,810
that you have so many
clients driven to despair

129
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,312
that you keep a prescription for them?

130
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,513
- I do.

131
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:44,514
It's infallible.

132
00:05:47,317 --> 00:05:50,853
- You're sure that they
have all died painlessly

133
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,089
and instantaneously?

134
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,024
- No, they're all still alive.

135
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,726
- Alive?

136
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,328
The prescription is a harmless fraud.

137
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:01,230
- No, that's a deadly poison,
they just never take it.

138
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,065
- Why?

139
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,933
- I don't know, but they never do.

140
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:05,335
- Well, I will.

141
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:09,038
And I hope you are lethally
injected for giving it to me.

142
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,274
- I'm only acting as your solicitor.

143
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:12,842
You have said you wanted to commit suicide

144
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,444
and you've come to me for advice.

145
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,679
I'm doing my best for
you, so that you can die

146
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:20,283
without wasting a lot of
gas or diving off a cliff.

147
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:22,685
And I'll only charge your executors $500.

148
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:25,588
- For advising me how to kill myself?

149
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:27,890
- Tomorrow, not today.

150
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,226
- Why put it off until tomorrow?

151
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,528
- Tomorrow's as good as today.

152
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:33,363
There's no hurry.

153
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:37,700
- You are a brute, a beast, and a pig.

154
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,369
My life is nothing to you.

155
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:42,005
You do not even ask what
has driven me to this.

156
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,272
You're the lowest of the low.

157
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,942
You make money out of the
death of your clients!

158
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:46,943
- I do.

159
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,811
There will be quite a
bit of business connected

160
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:49,612
with your death.

161
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,914
I'm sure Alex will come
settle your affairs.

162
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:55,685
- And you expect me to kill
myself to make money for you?

163
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,820
- Well, it's you who raised
my expectations, sir.

164
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,456
- Oh, St. Joan of Arc, listen to this man!

165
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:02,992
Has it ever occurred to you

166
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,894
that when someone's life is wrecked,

167
00:07:04,894 --> 00:07:09,432
they need a little sympathy
and not a bottle of poison?

168
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,667
You're as despicable as a psychiatrist!

169
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,337
- I really can't sympathize with suicide.

170
00:07:14,337 --> 00:07:16,639
It's never appealed to me, somehow.

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,940
But still, if it must be done,

172
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,243
it should be done promptly
and scientifically.

173
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:24,013
- You don't even ask what
Alexander has done to me.

174
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,648
- Why does it matter what
Alexander has done to you

175
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:26,482
when you're dead?

176
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:28,317
- You are what my
grandmother would have called

177
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,086
an unmitigated hog, Julius Sagamore!

178
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:31,320
- Why bother about me?

179
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,556
The prescription will solve everything.

180
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,791
- Damn your prescription!

181
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,093
There!

182
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,328
- Infallible.

183
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,799
Now that you've blown off some steam,

184
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,268
why don't you sit down
and tell me what is wrong?

185
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:49,072
Please, go ahead.

186
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:53,342
- As I said, my father was
the greatest man in the world.

187
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,180
He loved me, his only child, so much

188
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,348
that as soon as it became apparent to him

189
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,351
that I would happier
spending my life with a man

190
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,387
than a woman, he became one

191
00:08:04,387 --> 00:08:08,791
of the nation's most avid
supporters of same sex marriage.

192
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,362
His only concern was that I
should make a foolish marriage,

193
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:16,999
and lose the little money
he was able to leave me.

194
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,968
- The 2.3 billion, precisely.

195
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,136
- Don't interrupt me.

196
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:24,140
He made me promise that
whenever a man wanted me

197
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,578
to marry him, I should impose
a condition on my consent.

198
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,979
- So?

199
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,047
What condition?

200
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,382
- I was to give him $10,000,

201
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,951
and tell him that if within six months

202
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:39,722
he had turned that $10,000
into three million, I was his.

203
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,291
If not, I was never to see him again.

204
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,826
I saw the wisdom of this!

205
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:46,062
Nobody but my father could have thought

206
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:50,933
of such a real, infallible,
unsentimental test.

207
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,169
I gave him my sacred promise

208
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,371
that I would carry it out faithfully.

209
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,140
- And you broke that promise, I see.

210
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,008
- What do you mean, broke that promise?

211
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,110
- Well, you married Alexander.

212
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,812
Now Alexander is a jolly good fellow

213
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:04,947
but you're not going to persuade me

214
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,383
that Alexander made 3
million in six months

215
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:08,651
with a capital of 10,000.

216
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:10,887
- He did.

217
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:14,357
That man's luck is extraordinary.

218
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,893
He always wins.

219
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:18,094
He wins at tennis.

220
00:09:18,094 --> 00:09:19,929
He wins at boxing.

221
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,698
I saw him win an amateur
middle weight championship.

222
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,434
He has a solar plexus punch

223
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,237
that no other boxer can withstand.

224
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,105
- And you married a man

225
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,941
for his superlative solar plexus punch?

226
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,277
- Well, he was handsome.

227
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,946
Now, I admit I can be quite prudish,

228
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,749
and I don't enjoy the sexual activities

229
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:43,719
that most men of my orientation revel in.

230
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:46,522
I'm a pure romantic,

231
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,458
and I've never needed
anything beyond kissing

232
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,795
and cuddling to feel happy with a man.

233
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:55,298
- And Alexander knew that you were,

234
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,134
well, essentially Asexual,
when he married you?

235
00:09:58,134 --> 00:09:59,468
- Every man I've ever gone out with

236
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,070
on a date has known that!

237
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:04,473
I've tried to confine myself
to Roman Catholic men,

238
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,709
as they are much easier to convince

239
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:09,712
that sex is base and vulgar,

240
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:14,417
and that, you know, romance
and matters of the heart

241
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,786
are what's really important.

242
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,988
Alexander himself comes

243
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,557
from a very strong Roman Catholic family,

244
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:25,895
and I'm afraid I made
a very common mistake.

245
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:28,998
I took him at his word when he
told me that, as a Catholic,

246
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:31,601
he believed it was sinful
to have sex with a man.

247
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:35,137
At first I thought that
his religious beliefs

248
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,474
and my chastity were
going to be compatible,

249
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:42,044
but what I didn't realize was
that boxing had been his way

250
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:45,248
of sublimating his sexual urges.

251
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,216
Do you know what sublimation is?

252
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:48,050
- I do.

253
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,151
I minored in Psychology.

254
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:51,053
- Oh, so did I.

255
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:55,891
Anyhow, all of Alexander's
ardor was in his fists.

256
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,663
I shall never forget the day,
it was during our honeymoon...

257
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:03,266
(Gounod's "Romeo et
Juliette" inspired theme)

258
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:21,017
...when his unwillingness to
spoon together infuriated me

259
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,786
to such a degree that I
went for him with my fists.

260
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,989
He knocked me out with
that abominable punch

261
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,824
in the first exchange.

262
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,093
(shouting)

263
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:33,429
Have you ever been knocked out

264
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,797
by a punch in the solar plexus?

265
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,432
- No, no, thank goodness.

266
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm not a pugilist.

267
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,469
- It does not put you to
sleep like a punch on the jaw!

268
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:44,640
When Alexander saw my
face contorted in agony,

269
00:11:48,144 --> 00:11:49,478
he was horrified.

270
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,614
He said he did it automatically,

271
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,983
that he always countered
that way, by instinct.

272
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,194
I almost respected him for it.

273
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,595
- Then why do you want to get rid of him?

274
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,764
- I want to get rid of myself!

275
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:11,167
I want to punish myself for
making a mess of my life

276
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,769
and marrying an imbecile.

277
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,706
I, Victor Ognisanti di Parerga, saw myself

278
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:19,408
as the most sophisticated
young man in America

279
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,911
marrying the most impressive
fellow I'd ever seen.

280
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:25,948
And I was only a goose
marrying a buck rabbit!

281
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,384
What was there for me but death?

282
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:32,421
And now you have put me
off it with your fooling

283
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,824
and I don't know what I want.

284
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,360
That is a horrible state of mind.

285
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:43,566
I am a man who must always want
something and always get it!

286
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,034
- An acquisitive man.

287
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,235
Precisely.

288
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:47,536
How splendid.

289
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,704
(phone ringing)

290
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:49,605
One moment.

291
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,834
Yes?

292
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,337
One moment.

293
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,107
Your husband is here with another man.

294
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,108
They want to see me.

295
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,658
- I have no sense of humor,

296
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:20,461
but this strikes me as irresistibly funny!

297
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,530
(laughs)

298
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,134
You actually left me to spend the night

299
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:30,037
in the arms of Mr. Thonghunter.

300
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:30,871
- No.

301
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:33,674
No, no, I tell you,
it's perfectly innocent.

302
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,109
- Was he in your arms or was he not?

303
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:38,078
- Well, yes, of course he was in my arms.

304
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,780
Just not in the way that you mean.

305
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:43,584
- Then he's even more of a repressed fish

306
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,919
than I took him for.

307
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,656
But really, a man capable of
flouncing out of the house

308
00:13:48,656 --> 00:13:50,991
when I was on the point of pardoning him

309
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:54,094
and giving him a night
of real romantic bliss

310
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:57,031
would be capable of any imbecility.

311
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:57,865
- Pardoning me?

312
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,534
Pardoning me for what?

313
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,503
What had I done when you flew out at me?

314
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,371
- I did not fly out at you.

315
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,040
I have never lost my dignity

316
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,676
even under the most insufferable wrongs.

317
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:09,743
- You hadn't any wrongs.

318
00:14:09,743 --> 00:14:11,312
You drove me out of the house.

319
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,513
- I did not.

320
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,648
I never meant you to go.

321
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:18,185
It was abominably selfish of you.

322
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,357
You had your Thonghunter
to go to, I had nobody.

323
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:25,092
Adrian was out of town.

324
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:26,026
- Adrian?

325
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:28,028
I don't follow.

326
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:31,866
- Well, he is a gentleman
with whom I discuss subjects

327
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:34,568
that are beyond my husband's mental grasp,

328
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:38,506
which, as you can see,
is extremely limited.

329
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,674
- A dude that sets up
to be an intellectual

330
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:43,210
because his father was a publisher.

331
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,145
He makes up to Vicki and
pretends to be in love with him

332
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,847
because Vicki has a good caterer.

333
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:50,017
I tell Vicki the dude cares
for nothing but his food.

334
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,052
He only comes at mealtimes.

335
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,255
A belly-god, I call him.

336
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,223
And I'm expected to put up with him.

337
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,359
But if I so much as look at Hector...

338
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:00,761
Oh my!

339
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,963
- The cases are quite different.

340
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:06,233
Adrian worships the ground
I tread on, that is true.

341
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:08,168
But if you think Thonghunter worships

342
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:11,338
the ground you tread on, you
flatter yourself grossly.

343
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:14,341
The man endures you and pets you

344
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,644
because you buy thongs for him,

345
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:20,614
and no doubt anything
else he might be short of.

346
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,782
- Well, I never contradict anyone,

347
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,584
as that always leads to trouble.

348
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:26,387
And I'm afraid I do cost him a good deal,

349
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:30,090
as he does like me to have nice
things that I can't afford.

350
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,226
- No, Hecky darling, you don't.

351
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:35,129
I'm always pushing things
on you that you won't take.

352
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:36,997
You're a heck of a lot
more careful with my money

353
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:37,932
than I am myself.

354
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:40,334
- Aww, how touching!

355
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,735
(phone ringing)

356
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:42,570
- One moment.

357
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:45,906
Yes?

358
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,210
Did you say Blenderbland?

359
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,211
- Adrian?

360
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,613
How did he know I was here?

361
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,748
- Ask the gentleman to wait.

362
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:57,818
Perhaps you can tell me something
about him, Mr. di Parerga?

363
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:00,654
Is he the chairman of
Blenderbland's Literary Pennyworths?

364
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:01,589
- No, no, no.

365
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,158
That's his father, who
created the business.

366
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:07,728
Adrian is on the board, but
he has no business ability.

367
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:09,863
He is on 15 boards of directors, in fact,

368
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,466
on the strength of his
father's reputation,

369
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,535
but has never, as far as I know,

370
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:17,338
contributed an idea to any of them.

371
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,006
- Be fair to him, Vicki.

372
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:22,242
No man in New York knows how
to order a dinner better.

373
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,978
That's what keeps him
at the top in this town.

374
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,379
- Thank you, I think I know enough.

375
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,580
Shall I send him in?

376
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,216
- Certainly, I want to
know what he is doing here.

377
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:31,018
- That's fine with me.

378
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:33,120
You understand, of course,
that I am not supposed

379
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,489
to know anything of his
relations with my husband,

380
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:36,523
whatever they may be.

381
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:41,795
- They are perfectly innocent..so far.

382
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:44,131
I am not quite convinced
that I love Adrian yet.

383
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:47,735
He makes himself agreeable, that is all.

384
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:50,004
- Send the gentleman in.

385
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:53,841
- Hello.

386
00:16:54,908 --> 00:16:57,711
Where have we all come from?

387
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,513
(laughs)

388
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:01,248
Good morning, Vic.

389
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,951
How you doing, Alexander?

390
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,654
And Mr. Sagamore, I presume.

391
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:07,755
- Yes.

392
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:11,058
- I didn't know you were engaged.

393
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:11,892
- You actually came

394
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:13,394
at exactly the right
time, Mr. Blenderbland.

395
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:15,529
Please have a seat.

396
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,363
- Thank you.

397
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:23,203
The fact is, Victor
mentioned your name to me

398
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:26,707
in conversation as his
choice of a new solicitor.

399
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:30,277
So I figured I couldn't
place myself in better hands.

400
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:34,415
- Did you come here to
consult Mr. Sagamore about me?

401
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:37,418
- Well, yes, I suppose so.

402
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:41,789
But hadn't we better discuss
it a little in private first?

403
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,524
- You shall do nothing of the sort!

404
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:46,794
I will not have my affairs
discussed by anybody

405
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:49,530
in public or in private!

406
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,099
They concern myself alone.

407
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,301
- May I not discuss my own affairs?

408
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,703
- Not with my solicitor,

409
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:56,704
I shan't have it!

410
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,472
- And now he's off at the deep end again.

411
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,374
We might as well go home.

412
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,944
- What is life if it isn't
lived at the deep end?

413
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:07,448
Alexander, you are a tadpole!

414
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:08,282
- Don't do that!

415
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:12,286
- Mr. Fitzfassenden, why did
you marry Mr. di Parerga?

416
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,587
- Why?

417
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:15,756
Does that require an explanation?

418
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:17,825
I have told you why I married him.

419
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:21,295
- Well, though you might not think it,

420
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:23,964
he can be terribly fascinating
when he wants to be.

421
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:25,766
- You are all here consulting me,

422
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,202
but none of you has given
me any instructions.

423
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,204
Had you all better not be divorced?

424
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,872
- What is the creature to live on?

425
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:32,873
He has nothing.

426
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:35,743
When Alexander proposed to me,

427
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:39,146
he was too great an idiot to
comprehend his own audacity.

428
00:18:39,146 --> 00:18:41,315
I kept my promise to my father.

429
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,917
I handed him a check for $10,000.

430
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,453
"Make that into three million
within six months," I said,

431
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:47,788
"and I am yours."

432
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:51,125
- You never told me this.

433
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,659
- Why would I tell you this?

434
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,295
It's a revolting story.

435
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,464
- What is revolting about it?

436
00:18:57,464 --> 00:18:59,500
Did I make good or did I not?

437
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,435
Did I go through hell to
make that money and win you

438
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,736
or did I not?

439
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,339
- Do I understand you to say, Alex,

440
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,408
that you made $3 million in six months?

441
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,276
- [Alexander] Why not?

442
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,812
- With your own madness, your ignorance,

443
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,647
your criminal instincts,

444
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,250
and the luck that attends the half-witted!

445
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,353
You won my hand,

446
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:23,023
for which the matrimonially
inclined gay populations

447
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:27,594
of America, England, and
Europe were on their knees!

448
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,832
What you deserved was a
five year prison sentence.

449
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,400
- Five?

450
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,902
15, more likely.

451
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,237
That was what I risked for you.

452
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:39,106
And what did I get by it?

453
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:41,542
Life with you was worse
than any prison sentence.

454
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:42,943
- It would have been heaven to you

455
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:47,014
if nature had fitted you for
such a companionship as mine.

456
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:49,016
But what was in it for me?

457
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,918
No man had been good enough for me!

458
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,388
I was like a prince in a modern fairy tale

459
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:58,392
offering all eligible gay
men alive my hand and fortune

460
00:19:58,392 --> 00:20:01,061
if they passed my father's test.

461
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:03,897
Able men, brilliant men, younger sons

462
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:06,500
of the noblest,
progressive-minded families

463
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,370
either refused the test or failed.

464
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,672
Why?

465
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:15,175
Because they were too honest or too proud.

466
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:19,213
This thing succeeded,

467
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:23,083
and I found myself tied
for life to an insect.

468
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,552
- You can say what you want,

469
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,922
but you were just as much in
love with me as I was with you.

470
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:36,496
- Well...you were young,
you were well shaped,

471
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,366
your lawn tennis was outstanding,

472
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,101
you were a magnificent boxer,

473
00:20:42,102 --> 00:20:46,340
and I was excited
by...physical contact with you.

474
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,407
- [Julius] I thought you were revolted

475
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,443
by sexual contact, Mr. di Parerga.

476
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,712
- Physical contact is obviously distinct

477
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:54,848
from sexual contact, Julius Sagamore,

478
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:58,752
and therefore, physical
attraction is obviously distinct

479
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,554
from sexual attraction.

480
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:04,858
A person can be physically
attracted to someone

481
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:07,995
and want to kiss them and embrace them,

482
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:11,865
without necessarily wanting to
make sexual contact with them

483
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:14,134
and blow them or screw them!

484
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:22,309
Anyhow, Alexander is
physically attractive.

485
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,580
I wished to keep making
physical contact with him,

486
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,917
and that is my sole excuse
for having married him.

487
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:32,219
Now are you going to sit there

488
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:35,789
and pretend that he has any mental charm?

489
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:41,128
- But how did he make the $3 million?

490
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,230
Was it on the Stock Exchange?

491
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,998
My bank account balance at present is

492
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:46,133
somewhere around 10 grand,

493
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,968
so I should very much like to know how

494
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,670
to make it up to three million.

495
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:54,675
You are so rich, Victor,
that every decent man

496
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:57,711
who approaches you feels
like a needy adventurer.

497
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:59,212
You don't know how a guy

498
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:03,016
to whom $5,000 is a considerable sum feels

499
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,017
in the arms of a man

500
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:08,155
to whom a million is simply pocket money.

501
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:11,458
- Nor do you know what it's
like to be in the arms of a man

502
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,328
and know that you could
buy him up 20 times over

503
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:16,997
and never miss the price!

504
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:22,002
- Now, if I give you my 10
grand, will you invest it for me?

505
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,139
- It is not worth investing.

506
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,475
You cannot make money
on the Stock Exchange

507
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,812
until your weekly account is
at least a couple of millions.

508
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,315
Do not meddle with money, Adrian!

509
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,185
You do not understand it.

510
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:41,822
I will give you all you need.

511
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:44,358
- No, no, no, thank you.

512
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:46,660
I would lose my self respect.

513
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:49,629
Plus I prefer the poor man's luxury

514
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,399
of paying for your taxi rides and flowers

515
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,068
and theater tickets and high teas,

516
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:58,305
and lending you all the
little sums of money you need

517
00:22:58,305 --> 00:23:00,040
when we're together.

518
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,074
- Yes, it's true,

519
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:05,412
I never carry any pocket
money about with me.

520
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:08,015
Oh my gosh, I must owe you
a couple of hundred millions

521
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:10,751
in odd 10 dollar notes.

522
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:14,121
I shall tell my bankers that
you want 100 grand on account.

523
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:15,722
- But I don't.

524
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:18,859
I love lending you 10 dollar notes.

525
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:22,129
Of course, as they run
through my bank account

526
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,900
at an alarming rate, I would
honestly like a lesson or two

527
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,369
from Alex in the art of
turning tens of thousands

528
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,239
into hundreds and hundreds of thousands.

529
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:36,943
- His example would be
useless to you, Adrian,

530
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:40,781
because Alexander is
one of nature's marvels.

531
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:45,786
There is nothing marvelous about
you...except your appetite.

532
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,121
Listen.

533
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,924
On each of his birthdays,
his aunt presented him

534
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:54,694
with a CD featuring one or
all of the Three Tenors.

535
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,364
He found that he could
imitate the Three Tenors

536
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:59,332
with the greatest facility

537
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:02,469
and became convinced that
he could make a fortune

538
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:04,538
as an operatic tenor himself.

539
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,474
He was like those people
who go on reality TV shows

540
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,943
and think that they can sing opera

541
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,345
without any kind of
formal classical training.

542
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:13,580
You know those people.

543
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:18,285
So the first use he made of my money was

544
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:23,290
to give $3,500 to the manager
of an itsy bitsy opera company

545
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:27,294
which was then on its last legs in Buffalo

546
00:24:27,294 --> 00:24:30,630
to allow him to appear
for one night as Romeo

547
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,967
in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette".

548
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:38,605
I laughed until I fell
on the floor of my box

549
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:40,707
in screaming hysterics.

550
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,676
The audience hooted and booed

551
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:46,146
but they could not make themselves
heard above your roaring.

552
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:49,282
Romeo and Juliet hadn't even met yet,

553
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:51,852
when one of the ushers
came charging into my box

554
00:24:51,852 --> 00:24:54,054
and informed me that the
manager had absconded

555
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:58,592
with my $3,500 and left
the whole company flat.

556
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,830
- I'm telling you it was a plot.

557
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,432
Why shouldn't people like my singing?

558
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:05,834
I can sing louder than
any tenor on the stage.

559
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:07,369
I can sing higher!

560
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:09,771
- The poor blighter who
sang Mercutio was deaf

561
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,840
in the left ear, into which you bellowed

562
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,842
with all your force!

563
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:17,679
Not only did I have to agree
to pay everyone's salaries

564
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,014
at the end of the night,

565
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:21,349
but the prima donna refused
to get on the same stage

566
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:25,587
on which you'd bellowed! And
they didn't have an understudy,

567
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:29,024
so...I managed to save
the day for everyone

568
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:31,693
by singing Juliette myself!

569
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,495
Of course, we had to make an announcement

570
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:37,365
that the soprano was being
replaced by a baritone,

571
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:39,834
and so Juliette became Julien.

572
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:42,504
You see, I'd been classically trained

573
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:43,672
since I was a teenager,

574
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:47,475
and I know almost every
major opera by heart.

575
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:48,710
Especially the French ones,

576
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,979
as French is my favorite language.

577
00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:55,750
While other teenagers were watching porn,

578
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,352
I was studying opera.

579
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,156
(orchestra playing dramatically)

580
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,096
(singing the 'Ah! Je veux
vivre' French operatic aria)

581
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,103
(audience applauds)

582
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,977
(Victor's V/O) I must say, they
lapped it all up like honey.

583
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:06,815
- Yes, it's true.

584
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:09,951
He's probably the only baritone on Earth

585
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,953
that can execute the
florid musical ornaments

586
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:13,521
usually reserved for a soprano.

587
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:14,489
- Wow.

588
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:16,891
I'll have to hear you sing
some day, Mr. di Parerga.

589
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:19,360
- Oh, he could have gone pro
in opera if he wanted to.

590
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,628
- Except I could never tolerate

591
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:22,997
the way they sexualize opera these days,

592
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:27,402
you know, to cater to the
lowest common denominator.

593
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,337
- Well, in any case,

594
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:31,639
singing onstage with you was one

595
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,541
of the greatest experiences in my life.

596
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,711
And of course there was
no competition between us,

597
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,947
since I'm a tenor and he's a baritone.

598
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:41,850
I should have been the happiest man alive

599
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,052
if I could have established
my own opera company with you,

600
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,755
and gone on singing together
for the rest of our lives.

601
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:49,124
- And you would have been
the most handsome tenor

602
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:50,492
in the world to look at, dear,

603
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:53,661
but if I had to do one more duet with you,

604
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,697
I should have gone deaf myself.

605
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:57,866
I only did it that one night

606
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,734
because I believed I
owed it to the audience

607
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:00,902
to let the show go on.

608
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:06,775
- Still, this does not explain
how he made the $3 million.

609
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:12,080
- I leave him to tell that
disgraceful tale himself.

610
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,915
I believe he is proud of it.

611
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:19,687
He descended from opera to
the depths of ghetto garbage.

612
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:22,390
- Well, it worked out all right.

613
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,293
I met this young producer

614
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:27,695
and I told him I was crazy about
a guy who wouldn't marry me

615
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:30,131
unless I made three million in six months,

616
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:32,567
and that I had 6.5 grand to start with.

617
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,434
We took a theater.

618
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:35,403
We engaged a first rate cast.

619
00:29:35,403 --> 00:29:36,237
We got a play.

620
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:38,273
We got a superb production.

621
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:41,442
The story had all the
elements the public loves -

622
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:44,078
hookers, booze, weed, and hip hop.

623
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,514
We never asked the price of anything,

624
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:50,418
just went up to our necks for
tens and tens of thousands.

625
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,721
- But how did you pay
for all these things?

626
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:58,626
- It was a "Flamingo", but
it was a heck of a job.

627
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,428
- I don't understand.

628
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:02,230
What is a "flamingo"?

629
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,432
- It's actually quite simple.

630
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,234
You sell shares of the production

631
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,469
in order to pay for
something with a check.

632
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:09,404
So say you paid for something

633
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:11,372
with a check for 6 1/2 thousand,

634
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,608
but you don't have a dime in the bank.

635
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:16,444
You induce a friend or investor
to buy a share from you

636
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:18,112
for 6 1/2 thousand.

637
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,181
That provides for that check.

638
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:24,519
But then it obliges you, on
pain of 18 months imprisonment,

639
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,821
to induce another friend
or another investor

640
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,923
to buy a share for 13,000 from you.

641
00:30:28,923 --> 00:30:32,527
That provides for the next
check and the first investor.

642
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,296
And so you go on spending and selling

643
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:38,566
from 100% of shares to 500% of shares,

644
00:30:38,566 --> 00:30:40,468
from thousands to tens of thousands,

645
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:44,906
and from risks of 18 months
imprisonment to five years,

646
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:48,710
10 years, even 15 years.

647
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,745
But all I wanted was the three million,

648
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,081
so I cleared out with it

649
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:55,550
and I came swanking back
to claim Victor's hand.

650
00:30:58,353 --> 00:31:01,422
He thought I was great.

651
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:02,957
I was great.

652
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,426
The money made me great.

653
00:31:07,896 --> 00:31:10,465
I tell you, I was drunk on
it, I was like a new man.

654
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,102
- But just now, when
I suggested a divorce,

655
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:15,703
you asked how he would live.

656
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:18,640
What happened to the $3 million?

657
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,909
- He bought a circus with it,

658
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,912
after traveling to my
ancestral Sri Lanka with me

659
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:26,314
and falling in love with elephants.

660
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:29,517
He thought he could launch
the next Cirque du Soleil...

661
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:30,785
with elephants!

662
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:35,189
He thought everything he
touched would turn into gold.

663
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:38,026
I had to liquidate that
circus a month later.

664
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:39,761
He was about to turn the wild beasts loose

665
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:41,496
and run away when I intervened.

666
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:48,436
I was down $26,308 by the transaction.

667
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:50,805
- Was it my fault?

668
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,206
The elephant got influenza.

669
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,976
The Department of Health and
Human Services shut me down

670
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,010
and wouldn't let me move on

671
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,480
because the animals might
carry foot-and-mouth disease.

672
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,582
- In any event, the net result was

673
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:04,585
that instead of his being
$3 million to the good,

674
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:08,823
I was $26,300 to the bad.

675
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:12,260
Instead of bringing me the
revenues of a prince and a hero,

676
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,030
he cost me the allowance of a worm.

677
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:21,035
And now he has the audacity
to ask me for a divorce!

678
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:23,771
- No, I don't.

679
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,174
It was Julius who suggested that.

680
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:29,711
How can I afford to let you divorce me?

681
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:32,680
As your husband I enjoy a good
deal of social consideration,

682
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,749
and the retailers give
me unlimited credit.

683
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:37,018
- For thongs, among other things.

684
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,020
- Oh, does he pay for them, Ally?

685
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,722
- No, never mind, darling.

686
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:43,257
I have proven that I can make
money when I am put to it

687
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:46,027
and I will do it again, and
I will buy you all the satin

688
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:48,096
and leather and jeweled thongs you want

689
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:49,497
out of my own earnings.

690
00:32:49,497 --> 00:32:50,898
Don't be upset, darling.

691
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:51,733
- There!

692
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,268
They think they are married already.

693
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:57,205
- I'm afraid the matter is
not in your hands, Alex.

694
00:32:57,205 --> 00:33:00,508
Mr. di Parerga can divorce you
whether you like it or not.

695
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:02,744
The evidence is that on a recent occasion

696
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:05,013
you left your spouse to take refuge

697
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,281
in the arms of Mr. Rodriguez.

698
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:09,751
The Court will give Mr. di
Parerga a decree on that.

699
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:11,319
- Well, let it.

700
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,789
I can support Alexander until
he makes another fortune.

701
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:17,325
Yes, you all think he's a
fool, but he's a good boy.

702
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:20,294
I think it's just disgusting
how you all turn against him,

703
00:33:20,294 --> 00:33:22,397
and how you treat him
like dirt under your feet.

704
00:33:22,397 --> 00:33:23,664
I mean, I would like to know,

705
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:26,134
what would you be without your money?

706
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:30,104
- Nobody is anybody
without money, Thonghunter.

707
00:33:30,104 --> 00:33:32,140
My dear old father taught me that.

708
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,143
"Stick to your money," he said,

709
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:38,312
"and all the other things
shall be added unto you!"

710
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:41,482
He said it was in the Bible.

711
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:43,551
I have never verified the quotation

712
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:45,920
but I have never forgotten it.

713
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,755
I have stuck to my money

714
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:50,158
and I shall continue to stick to it.

715
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:54,095
Rich as I am, I can
hardly forgive Alexander

716
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:57,832
for letting me down by $26,300.

717
00:33:57,832 --> 00:34:01,202
- $26,308, stingy beast, don't forget.

718
00:34:02,036 --> 00:34:02,970
But I will pay it.

719
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:05,039
- Yes, you will, hun,

720
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,808
I'll take out my insurance
and give it to you.

721
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,478
- May I have that in
writing, Mr. Rodriguez?

722
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:12,814
- Oh, you should be ashamed
of yourself, you greedy pig.

723
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:14,449
It was your own fault.

724
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,018
Why did you sell the elephant for 2,500?

725
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:18,119
He cost 20 grand!

726
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,388
- Let's not diverge from the point.

727
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:21,222
- What is the point?

728
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:24,459
- The point is you can
obtain a divorce if you wish.

729
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,960
- I don't wish.

730
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:29,363
Do you think I am going to be
dragged through divorce courts

731
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:32,733
and have my picture in the
papers with that thing?

732
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:36,037
To have the story of my
infatuation told in headlines

733
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,239
in every tabloid in town?

734
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:44,479
Besides, it is convenient to be married.

735
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,848
It is respectable.

736
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:49,951
It keeps other men and women off.

737
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:54,455
It gives me a freedom that I
cannot enjoy as a single man.

738
00:34:54,455 --> 00:34:57,658
I have become accustomed
to having a spouse.

739
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:02,730
No, decidedly, I will
not divorce Alexander,

740
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,067
at least until I can find a
substitute whom I really want!

741
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:11,105
- You can't divorce Alexander
unless he chose to let you.

742
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:13,074
He's too much of a
gentleman to mention it,

743
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:15,109
but your own behavior
hasn't been so very pure

744
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:17,411
that you'd like to have
it shown up in court.

745
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:19,046
- Look.

746
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:23,618
Alexander was the first man I ever loved,

747
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:27,021
and I hope he will not be the last.

748
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:31,359
But legal difficulties do not
exist for people with money.

749
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:37,231
In any event, as Alexander here
cannot afford to divorce me,

750
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,301
and I have no intention of divorcing him,

751
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,069
the question does not arise!

752
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:46,107
And now I shall need some fresh air.

753
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:51,112
This orgy of domesticity
has made the room stuffy.

754
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:54,348
Come along, Adrian, we'll
drive along to the country

755
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,716
and lunch there.

756
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:58,419
I know the quaintest
little lakeside place,

757
00:35:58,419 --> 00:36:02,757
with enough trees and flowers
around to rejuvenate my soul.

758
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,369
How jolly!

759
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:10,774
- Well, I must be a very attractive man.

760
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:13,777
- Indeed!

761
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,212
Not that I am denying it,

762
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:19,616
but what has it to do with
what I have just said?

763
00:36:19,616 --> 00:36:22,185
- You said "How jolly!"

764
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:24,621
I look round at this rotten old inn

765
00:36:24,621 --> 00:36:27,991
trying to pretend that
it's a lakeside hotel.

766
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:31,094
We have just had a horrible meal.

767
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:33,964
Now if you can suffer
this and say "How jolly!"

768
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:36,700
there must be some
irresistible attraction present

769
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,502
and I can see nothing

770
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:42,673
that is not utterly
repulsive except myself!

771
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:48,979
- Don't you like these
dear old-world places?

772
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:52,649
I do.

773
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:53,617
- I don't.

774
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:57,988
Your apartment on the Upper
East Side cost more to furnish

775
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:02,025
than this place did to
build from the ground up.

776
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:04,728
You can get a decent lunch
there, perfectly served,

777
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:07,030
by a word through the telephone.

778
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,401
Or one of your luxurious
cars will whisk you off

779
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:15,005
to one of a dozen first rate
hotels with great views.

780
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:20,010
And yet you chose this filthy
old inn and say "How jolly!"

781
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:26,550
What is the use of being a
billionaire on such terms?

782
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,987
- When I was first let loose on the world

783
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:33,657
with unlimited money, how
long do you think it took me

784
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,025
to get sick of shopping

785
00:37:35,025 --> 00:37:38,195
and tired of all the luxuries
you think so much of?

786
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:40,731
About a fortnight.

787
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:46,737
My father, when he had $7
billion, flew commercial

788
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,374
rather than having his own private jet,

789
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:55,078
and never spent more than
$50 a day on himself,

790
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,980
except when he was entertaining people

791
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,715
who were useful to him.

792
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,785
Why should he?

793
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:03,820
He couldn't eat more than anyone else.

794
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,089
He couldn't drink more than anyone else.

795
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:08,258
He couldn't wear more than anyone else.

796
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,228
Neither can I.

797
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:16,066
- But you promised me a
very special treat, Victor.

798
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,269
You said you had found out
the most wonderful place

799
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,505
by the lake, where we could be ourselves

800
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:26,076
and have a delicious cottage
meal in primitive happiness.

801
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:30,113
Now where is the charm
of this dismal hole?

802
00:38:30,113 --> 00:38:32,249
Have you ever had a viler lunch?

803
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:33,817
There's not even a private sitting room.

804
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:35,986
All these base people can just come and go

805
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:37,721
as ever they please.

806
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,222
I can think of at least
five other places upstate

807
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:40,057
where we would have been
much more comfortable.

808
00:38:40,057 --> 00:38:43,460
And look, the weather forecast
says there might be rain.

809
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:53,236
- Is that my fault?

810
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:57,574
- Well, it completes your notion
of a happy day by the lake.

811
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:00,544
Why is it that people

812
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:03,547
who know how to enjoy
themselves never have any money,

813
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:06,817
and the people who have
money never know how

814
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,852
to enjoy themselves?

815
00:39:11,354 --> 00:39:14,858
- You are not making
yourself agreeable, Adrian.

816
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:20,464
- And you are not entertaining
me munificently, Victor.

817
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,200
For heaven's sake,

818
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,535
let's get in the car
and go to the Hamptons.

819
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,970
The car is far more luxurious

820
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,241
than this hideous coffee
room, and more private.

821
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:33,210
- I am tired of my car.

822
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,812
- I'm not tired of your car.

823
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:38,181
I wish I could afford one like it.

824
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,052
- I thought you would enjoy sitting

825
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:44,821
in this crazy out-of-the-way
place talking to me.

826
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,359
But I find you are a
spoiled, fussy bachelor.

827
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,661
You care about nothing but your food

828
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:54,064
and your little comforts.

829
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,699
Oh my goodness!

830
00:39:56,566 --> 00:39:58,201
You should have met my father.

831
00:39:59,903 --> 00:40:02,305
- I'm very glad I did not.

832
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:06,843
- What's that you say?

833
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,314
- My dear Victor, if
we are to remain close,

834
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:14,417
I might as well be quite frank with you.

835
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:17,788
Everything you've told me
about your father convinces me

836
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:21,691
that though he was an affectionate
parent and amiable enough

837
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:25,862
to explain your rather
tiresome father fixation,

838
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:28,031
as Dr. Freud would call it,

839
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:31,768
he must have been quite
the most appalling bore

840
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:35,639
to ever devastate even a Rotary Club!

841
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,907
- My father!

842
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:39,810
You infinite nothingness!

843
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,646
My father made billions of dollars.

844
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:44,648
You never even made half a million.

845
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:47,651
- My good boy, your father
never made anything.

846
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:51,154
I haven't the slightest
notion of how he contrived

847
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:51,988
to get a legal claim on so
much of what others made,

848
00:40:51,988 --> 00:40:54,758
but I do know he managed
to lose 4/5ths of it

849
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:00,096
by being far enough behind the times

850
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:03,266
to buy up the properties of
those Middle Eastern royals

851
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:05,702
under the belief that America would squash

852
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:08,271
the revolution there in three weeks or so.

853
00:41:08,271 --> 00:41:11,541
Could anyone have made a stupider mistake?

854
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:12,909
Not I!

855
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:16,546
- You rotten thing.

856
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:19,249
Take that for calling my father a bore!

857
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:21,284
- Please, restrain yourself!

858
00:41:21,284 --> 00:41:23,553
You might have hurt me very seriously.

859
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:25,922
- I will hurt you until
you wish yourself dead.

860
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:28,692
Scum!

861
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:30,227
Filth!

862
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:32,629
Take that for saying
he never made anything.

863
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:35,298
- Help!

864
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:36,867
There's a madman on the loose.

865
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:40,437
I won't be able to hold
him single handedly, help!

866
00:41:40,437 --> 00:41:41,271
- Vermin!

867
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,241
- Help, police!

868
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:45,208
He's murdering me.

869
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,042
He's mad.

870
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:47,711
- Dirt!

871
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:49,412
Carrion!

872
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,318
(groans)

873
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:00,090
You brute!

874
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:03,827
You've killed me.

875
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,668
(crying)

876
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:13,169
Oh, Daddy!

877
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:15,338
(banging)

878
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,048
- What's the matter?

879
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:26,917
What is going on here?

880
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:33,456
- Who the devil are you?

881
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:35,525
- I am a doctor.

882
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:36,359
I heard a great disturbance,

883
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,161
I hastened to ascertain the cause,

884
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:41,998
and now I find you here in convulsions.

885
00:42:43,366 --> 00:42:44,200
Can I help?

886
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:47,170
- I am dying.

887
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,538
- Nonsense.

888
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:49,940
You can swear.

889
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,942
The fit has subsided.

890
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:54,144
You can sit back, you are quite well.

891
00:42:56,112 --> 00:42:57,213
Good afternoon.

892
00:42:57,213 --> 00:42:58,048
- Stop!

893
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:01,518
I am not quite well, I
am on the point of death.

894
00:43:01,518 --> 00:43:03,253
I need a doctor!

895
00:43:03,253 --> 00:43:04,688
I am a rich man.

896
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,891
- In that case, you
should have no difficulty

897
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:11,061
finding any doctor in the
area. You don't need me.

898
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,896
Is there anyone else who needs my help?

899
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:14,230
I was upstairs.

900
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,700
The sound was of somebody
falling downstairs.

901
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,002
He may have broken some bones!

902
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:19,836
Excuse me.

903
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:23,673
- Never mind him!

904
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,242
If he had broken every bone in his body,

905
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:28,712
it is no more than he deserves.

906
00:43:28,712 --> 00:43:30,246
Come back instantly.

907
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:31,514
I want you.

908
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:32,916
Come back.

909
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:33,750
Come back!

910
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:52,702
- The landlord is taking the gentleman

911
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:54,104
to the hospital in your car.

912
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:57,340
- In my car?

913
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,142
I shan't permit it.

914
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:01,144
Let them call an ambulance.

915
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:02,312
- The car has gone.

916
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:04,647
You should be very glad
it is being so useful.

917
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:10,453
- It is your business to
doctor me, not to lecture me.

918
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:12,589
- I am not your doctor.

919
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:13,656
I am not in general practice.

920
00:44:13,656 --> 00:44:16,826
I keep a clinic for penniless
refugees and immigrants,

921
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:19,062
and I work at the cottage hospital.

922
00:44:19,062 --> 00:44:20,230
I cannot attend to you.

923
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:22,565
- You can attend to me!

924
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:28,505
You must attend to me!

925
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,574
Are you going to leave me here to die?

926
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:32,742
- You're not dying.

927
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:34,177
Not yet, at least.

928
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:36,079
Your own doctor will attend to you.

929
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,680
- You are my own doctor.

930
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,485
I tell you I am a rich man!
Doctors' fees are nothing to me.

931
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:44,020
Charge me what you please,

932
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,956
but you must and shall attend to me!

933
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:48,825
You are abominably rude,

934
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:52,796
but you inspire confidence as a doctor.

935
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:55,098
- If I attended all those in
whom I inspire confidence,

936
00:44:55,098 --> 00:44:57,100
I should be worn out in a week.

937
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,670
I have to reserve myself for
the poor and useful people!

938
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,472
- Then you are either a fool

939
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:05,542
or a miserable imitation of Mother Teresa!

940
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,877
- I wouldn't compare
myself to Mother Teresa.

941
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:08,912
I am a devout Catholic

942
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:11,181
and I do consider myself a servant of God.

943
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:15,985
- You are not! You are
my doctor, do you hear?

944
00:45:15,985 --> 00:45:17,720
I am a sick man.

945
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,024
You can't abandon me to
die in this wretched place.

946
00:45:21,024 --> 00:45:23,126
- I see no symptoms of sickness about you.

947
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:25,962
Are you in pain?

948
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:27,397
- Yes.

949
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:28,398
Horrible pain.

950
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:30,733
- Whereabouts?

951
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:34,471
- Don't cross-examine me as
if you didn't believe me.

952
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:36,239
I must have sprained my wrist

953
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,242
throwing that beast all over the place.

954
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:40,110
- Which one?

955
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,714
- This!

956
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,721
- Nothing whatever the matter.

957
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:53,523
- How do you know?

958
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:54,524
It's my hand, not yours!

959
00:45:54,524 --> 00:45:55,725
- You would scream the house down

960
00:45:55,725 --> 00:45:57,360
if your wrist were sprained.

961
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,762
You are shamming, lying.

962
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,097
Why?

963
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,866
Is it to make yourself interesting?

964
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:09,205
- Make myself interesting?

965
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:12,108
Man, I am interesting!

966
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:15,044
- Not in the least, medically.

967
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:17,780
Are you interesting in any other way?

968
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:22,285
- I am the most interesting
young man in America!

969
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:25,388
I am Victor Ognisanti di Parerga.

970
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:27,724
- Never heard of him.

971
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,027
Eurasian aristocrat, I presume.

972
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:33,363
- Aristocrat?

973
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:35,632
Do you take me for a fool?

974
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:37,967
My ancestors were moneylenders

975
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:42,405
to half of Europe and Asia 500 years ago.

976
00:46:42,405 --> 00:46:45,875
We are now bankers to
almost the whole world.

977
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:50,079
- Well then, you should
be a Jewish Princess.

978
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,750
- Spare me your attempts at humor.

979
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,352
The stupidest di Parerga can just walk

980
00:46:56,352 --> 00:47:00,456
round the cleverest Jew when
it comes to moneymaking.

981
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:04,027
We are the only real
aristocracy in the world,

982
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:07,230
the aristocracy of money.

983
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,465
- The plutocracy, in fact.

984
00:47:09,465 --> 00:47:10,867
- If you like.

985
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:13,836
I am a plutocrat of the plutocrats.

986
00:47:15,939 --> 00:47:19,776
- Well, that is a disease
for which I do not prescribe.

987
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:22,445
The only known cure is a revolution,

988
00:47:23,646 --> 00:47:25,515
but the mortality rate can be high.

989
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:27,450
If it is the wrong sort of revolution,

990
00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:30,220
it only intensifies the disease.

991
00:47:33,356 --> 00:47:34,490
I cannot help you.

992
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,159
I must get back to work.

993
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:36,993
Good afternoon.

994
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,428
- But this is your work!

995
00:47:38,428 --> 00:47:39,696
What else have you to do?

996
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,699
- There is more good
to be done in the world

997
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:46,669
besides attending to
rich imaginary invalids.

998
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:49,272
- But if you are well paid?

999
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:51,007
- I make the little money I need by work

1000
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:53,543
which I venture to think more important.

1001
00:47:53,543 --> 00:47:54,944
Although my father's American,

1002
00:47:54,944 --> 00:47:57,614
I grew up mostly in France
with my French mother,

1003
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:01,384
and so I do not espouse the
materialistic values of America,

1004
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:03,419
only its work ethic.

1005
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:09,826
- You are a hog, a beast, and a twit.

1006
00:48:09,826 --> 00:48:11,761
It is the most abominable thing of you

1007
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:14,697
to leave me here in my distress!

1008
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:16,432
My car is gone!

1009
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,067
I have no money!

1010
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,736
I never carry any money about.

1011
00:48:20,703 --> 00:48:22,605
- I have none to carry!

1012
00:48:22,605 --> 00:48:24,774
Your car will return presently.

1013
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:26,676
You can borrow money from your driver.

1014
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:31,381
- You are an unmitigated
hippopotamus is what you are!

1015
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:35,918
I've known many fine gentlemen from France

1016
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:39,422
but you are just a Snail Snapper!

1017
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:42,759
I might have known it
from that ridiculous cap

1018
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,527
pretending to be a beret.

1019
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:48,097
You should take it off in my presence!

1020
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,368
At least have the manners to stay with me

1021
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,504
until my chauffeur comes back.

1022
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,440
(car honks)

1023
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,574
- He has come back!

1024
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:06,777
- Damn.

1025
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,181
Can't you wait until he's
had his coffee at least?

1026
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,183
- No.

1027
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,086
Be good enough to give me back my cap.

1028
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,491
- I wanted to see what you
looked like without it.

1029
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,634
Now listen to me.

1030
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,271
You are having an adventure!

1031
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:37,274
Is there no romance in you?

1032
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:42,245
- First of all, what
makes you think I'm gay?

1033
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,884
- Oh, I have an excellent gaydar!

1034
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,690
And the only young men
who come here anymore are

1035
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,493
the more old-fashioned young gay men,

1036
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,830
who appreciate the fact that Joan Crawford

1037
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,066
and Judy Garland used to be regulars here,

1038
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,402
back when they lived in New York.

1039
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,538
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know already, surely.

1040
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,108
- I may be a friend of Dorothy,

1041
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,711
but I'm not a big Joan Crawford fan.

1042
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:18,215
- Oh, but Joan made so
many romantic pictures

1043
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,084
in the late '20s and throughout the '30s.

1044
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:26,556
I love her just as much
as Judy...and Audrey.

1045
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:31,194
But anyway, leave romance
aside for the moment.

1046
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,165
Haven't you even common curiosity?

1047
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:39,703
Don't you want to know why I
threw that beast downstairs?

1048
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,404
Don't you want to throw your wretched work

1049
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:45,342
to the devil for once and
have an afternoon by the lake

1050
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:49,346
with an interesting and attractive man?

1051
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,150
I'm not a sexual person, you see,

1052
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,684
so you don't have to worry

1053
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,287
about me trying to hook up with you.

1054
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:00,724
I don't do 95% of the things
that other gay men do,

1055
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,729
and I get the feeling you don't either,

1056
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,232
being the devout Catholic you say you are.

1057
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,703
- Yes, that is true.

1058
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,509
But regardless of gender, I'm
afraid people in general are

1059
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,710
neither interesting nor attractive to me

1060
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,345
unless they're ill.

1061
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,915
I know them too well, inside and out.

1062
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,817
God has put me on this earth
to treat those who are ill.

1063
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:30,420
You are perfectly well.

1064
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,388
- Liar!

1065
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,325
Nobody is perfectly well,

1066
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:40,597
nor ever has been, nor ever will be.

1067
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:43,266
- That is true.

1068
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:49,439
Are you married?

1069
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,775
- Yes.

1070
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,444
But you need not be afraid.

1071
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,479
My husband is openly unfaithful to me

1072
00:51:56,479 --> 00:51:58,815
and cannot take you into court

1073
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:02,052
if you were to make out with me.

1074
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,955
I can divorce him if necessary!

1075
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:09,893
- And the man you threw
downstairs, who was he?

1076
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:12,495
One does not throw
one's spouse downstairs.

1077
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,466
Did he make out with you,
or perhaps make you angry

1078
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,668
by trying to do more
than make out with you?

1079
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,804
- No.

1080
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,773
He insulted my father's memory

1081
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,576
because he was disappointed
with his lunch here.

1082
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,013
When I think of my father,

1083
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:35,452
all ordinary men seem
to me the merest trash!

1084
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,392
But you are not an ordinary man.

1085
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:45,962
I should like to see some more of you.

1086
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:52,002
Now that you have asked
me confidential questions

1087
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:56,139
about my family, and I have answered them,

1088
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,077
you can no longer pretend that
you are not my family doctor!

1089
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,282
So that is settled.

1090
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,085
- A father fixation, did you say?

1091
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,186
An excess of money?

1092
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,591
- Only a beggarly 2.3 billion.

1093
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,895
- You are a psychological curiosity.

1094
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,197
I will consider it.

1095
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,435
- Consider it?

1096
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:30,407
You will feel honored,
gratified, delighted.

1097
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:33,643
- I see...

1098
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:38,548
Enormous self-confidence,
reckless audacity, insane egotism,

1099
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,251
and apparently sexless.

1100
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,520
- Sexless? In the sense

1101
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,557
that I am chaste, pure,
and abstinent, yes.

1102
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,062
But I've been told over and
over by countless men and women

1103
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,964
that I'm strikingly sexy.

1104
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:57,200
- I meant you have a
rather androgynous demeanor

1105
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,636
about you. Neither masculine nor feminine.

1106
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,906
More like an angel.

1107
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,645
- [Victor] I should think
that's a good thing.

1108
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,514
- The bad thing is that you
seem to regard yourself alone

1109
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,485
as sacred, without
recognizing the sacredness

1110
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,755
of any other members of your
sex, as gay men usually do.

1111
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,625
- Other members of my sex indeed!

1112
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:28,431
I've always been infinitely
purer, more intelligent,

1113
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:33,002
and more refined than
other members of my sex!

1114
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:38,708
You were right to call
me more angel than human.

1115
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,978
Five minutes conversation
with the man I married

1116
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,514
will convince you that he
and I do not even belong

1117
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,016
to the same species!

1118
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,017
You told me a minute ago

1119
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:51,254
that you find neither sex
interesting or attractive.

1120
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,358
Likewise, I find neither sex sacred

1121
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,561
nor automatically worthy of respect.

1122
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,000
Most men and women are weak in mind!

1123
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,604
They yield to dozens of different vices,

1124
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,407
whether it's the consumption of alcohol,

1125
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:15,111
the viewing of pornography,
the engagement in all manner

1126
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,047
of disgusting sexual activities,

1127
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:24,387
and the compulsion to cheat,
steal, defraud, and destroy.

1128
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,994
But there are some great
men, like my father.

1129
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,230
There are some great women,

1130
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,700
like the patron saint of
France, St. Joan of Arc.

1131
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,174
And there are some good doctors, like you.

1132
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,214
- Thank you.

1133
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,086
What does your regular
doctor say about you?

1134
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,657
- I have no regular doctor.

1135
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,725
If I had, I should have
an operation a week

1136
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:06,262
until there was nothing left
of me or of my bank balance.

1137
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:12,302
I shan't expect you to maul
me about with a stethoscope,

1138
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,937
if that's what you are afraid of.

1139
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:19,576
I have the lungs of a whale and
the digestion of an ostrich.

1140
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,479
I have a clockwork inside.

1141
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,816
I'm up by sunrise no matter
what time I go to bed.

1142
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:33,656
When I want anything, I lose
my head so completely about it

1143
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,793
that I always get it!

1144
00:56:40,763 --> 00:56:43,333
- What things do you want most?

1145
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:45,435
- Everything!

1146
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:47,504
Anything!

1147
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,907
Like a lightning flash.

1148
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,909
And then there's no stopping me.

1149
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:58,715
- Well, everything and
anything is no thing.

1150
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,817
(Victor laughs and the Doctor chuckles)

1151
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,320
- Five minutes ago I wanted you.

1152
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,724
Now I have got you!

1153
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:09,392
- Oh, come now.

1154
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:11,694
You cannot bluff a doctor.

1155
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,863
You may want the sun and
the moon and the stars,

1156
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,899
but you simply cannot get them.

1157
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,037
- That is why I take good
care not to want them!

1158
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,875
I want only what I can get.

1159
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,478
- Good.

1160
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,480
A practical intellect.

1161
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,218
And what do you want at
the present, for instance?

1162
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,553
- That is the devil of it.

1163
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,491
There is nothing one can
get except more money.

1164
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,028
- What about more men?

1165
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:50,833
- More Alexanders, more Blenderblands?

1166
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,705
Those are not deep wants.

1167
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,909
At present I want a motor launch, yes.

1168
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,615
- There is no such thing in this place.

1169
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,684
- Tell the landlord to stop the first one

1170
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,085
that comes along and buy it.

1171
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:10,853
- Impossible.

1172
00:58:10,853 --> 00:58:13,056
People will not sell
their boats like that.

1173
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:15,592
- Have you ever tried?

1174
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,794
- Well, no.

1175
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:20,063
- I have.

1176
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,399
When I need a car or a motor boat

1177
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,701
or a launch or anything like that,

1178
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,403
I buy straight off the
road or off the river

1179
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,571
or out of the harbor.

1180
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,208
These things cost hundreds of thousands

1181
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,377
if not millions when they are new,

1182
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:37,280
but the next day you
can't get $500 for them.

1183
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,517
Offer a couple of
thousands for any of them

1184
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:43,886
and the owner dare not refuse.

1185
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,157
He knows he will never
get such an offer again.

1186
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:51,628
- Aha!

1187
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,164
You are a psychologist.

1188
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,867
This is very interesting.

1189
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,502
- Nonsense.

1190
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:04,474
I know how to buy and sell,
if that's what you mean.

1191
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,611
- That is how good
psychologists make their money.

1192
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,985
- Have you made any money?

1193
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,521
- No.

1194
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:20,791
I do not care for money,
I care for knowledge.

1195
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,462
- Knowledge is no use without money!

1196
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,566
You're not married, right?

1197
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,970
- I am married to Science.

1198
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,472
I have been since I was a boy.

1199
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:38,809
- Well, now you are a man,

1200
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:45,015
and I think you will find me
a far more fascinating spouse

1201
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:48,919
than Science could ever
be, if you marry me!

1202
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:51,489
- Oh!

1203
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:55,359
Is there any question of that between us?

1204
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,193
- Yes.

1205
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:58,562
I want to marry you.

1206
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:01,999
- No, Monsieur.

1207
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,302
You are an exceptionally handsome man,

1208
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:09,240
but Science is my spouse.

1209
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,510
- You can have Science as well,
I shan't be jealous of him!

1210
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:16,313
But does that mean that you're averse

1211
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:19,617
to Art, Literature and Music?

1212
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,318
- Quite the contrary.

1213
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:25,623
My mother raised her children
on Art, Literature, and Music.

1214
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,026
However, I only listen to
Classical, specifically Opera.

1215
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:31,629
- Would you like to listen

1216
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:34,698
to a French operatic aria right now?

1217
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,401
- Right now?

1218
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,503
How, on your phone?

1219
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:42,406
- Well, yes, the music's on my phone,

1220
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,376
but I'll perform it in the flesh.

1221
01:00:55,553 --> 01:01:00,558
(singing Saint-Saëns' aria
"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix" )

1222
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:18,829
- How did you know that that
is one of my favorite arias?

1223
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,766
- I didn't know.

1224
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,869
I only sang it because
it's one of my favorites,

1225
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:29,440
and because, well,

1226
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,411
the sentiment seemed perfectly
appropriate right now.

1227
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:38,382
- I have never heard it
sung more beautifully.

1228
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,021
You are truly, deeply blessed!

1229
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:46,724
- Thank you.

1230
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,727
That's very kind of you to say.

1231
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:56,467
I daresay it's a sign, that
you and I should both like...

1232
01:04:01,472 --> 01:04:06,443
But I made a solemn promise
to my father on his deathbed-

1233
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:07,411
- Stop.

1234
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,815
I made a solemn promise to
my mother on her deathbed!

1235
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:13,717
- What?

1236
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,057
- My mother was a very wise woman.

1237
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:22,226
She was a pillar of the
Roman Catholic Church

1238
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:25,262
and raised me on all the
Christian principles,

1239
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:27,264
but she also realized that
no amount of holy water

1240
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,233
would change the fact that I'm gay.

1241
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,834
(Victor laughs)

1242
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,837
After her prayers to make me heterosexual

1243
01:04:33,837 --> 01:04:36,273
remained unanswered for 10 years,

1244
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:39,109
she accepted that it was the
will of God that I be gay.

1245
01:04:40,678 --> 01:04:41,945
She made me swear to her however

1246
01:04:41,945 --> 01:04:45,282
that if any man wanted to
marry me, and I felt tempted,

1247
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:48,285
that I would hand the man 100 euros

1248
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,087
and tell him that unless
he went out into the world

1249
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:52,322
with just that and the
clothes he stood in,

1250
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:55,859
and earned his living alone
and unaided for six months,

1251
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,728
then I would never talk to him again.

1252
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,000
- And if he stood the test?

1253
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,270
- Then I must marry him,

1254
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,172
because any man who could help himself

1255
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:10,474
would be helped by God.

1256
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,820
- And you dare ask me,

1257
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:26,356
me, Victor Ognisanti di Parerga,

1258
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:30,461
to submit myself to
this test, to any test?

1259
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,361
- I swore.

1260
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,131
I was a mama's boy.

1261
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:37,634
My mother was as sweet
as the Blessed Virgin.

1262
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,304
I was attached to her like
Jesus was to the Madonna.

1263
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:45,175
- I myself have been
compared to the Madonna,

1264
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:47,678
a masculine version of
the Madonna, that is,

1265
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:51,982
by virtue of my chastity and purity.

1266
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:56,954
What was your mother, anyhow?

1267
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:58,122
A teacher?

1268
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,623
- A seamstress.

1269
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:00,424
A widow.

1270
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:02,893
She raised seven children.

1271
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:05,796
I was the youngest, the Gretl.

1272
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:10,601
The other six are honest working folk.

1273
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:13,337
With their help, she raised
me to be a man of learning.

1274
01:06:14,872 --> 01:06:16,206
It was her ambition to have a son

1275
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:18,709
who could serve God by serving mankind.

1276
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:22,546
With her prayers to the Blessed Virgin,

1277
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:24,548
God endowed me with the necessary talent.

1278
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,718
- And you think I will allow myself

1279
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:30,420
to be beaten by an old seamstress?

1280
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:33,957
- I am afraid so.

1281
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,326
You could never pass the test.

1282
01:06:38,595 --> 01:06:40,330
- Indeed!

1283
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,267
And my father's test for
a husband worthy of me?

1284
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:46,870
- Oh.

1285
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:49,540
I am to be tested too?

1286
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,407
- Mm-hm.

1287
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:52,943
- Never occurred to me.

1288
01:06:54,111 --> 01:06:56,480
- Nor to your mother either, it seems.

1289
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,816
Well, you know better now.

1290
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,919
I am to give you $10,000.

1291
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:06,190
In six months, you are to
increase it to three million!

1292
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,258
How is that for a test?

1293
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:11,628
- Quite conclusive.

1294
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:12,696
At the end of the six months,

1295
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:17,701
I shall have not a penny to
my name, praise be to God.

1296
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,139
- You confess yourself beaten?

1297
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,042
- Absolutely.

1298
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:25,876
Completely.

1299
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,180
- And you think I am beaten too.

1300
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,749
- Absolutely.

1301
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,085
You do not know what homeless poverty is,

1302
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:37,921
and God in his love and
mercy will take care

1303
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:38,856
that you never do.

1304
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,138
- How much is 100 euros exactly?

1305
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,278
- At the rate of exchange
contemplated by my mother,

1306
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,380
about $110.

1307
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:06,683
- Hand it over!

1308
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,923
- Unfortunately, my mother didn't provide

1309
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,058
for this contingency.

1310
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18,896
I do not have $110.

1311
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:21,665
I will have to borrow it from you.

1312
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,938
- I haven't a dollar on me.

1313
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,743
No matter, I will borrow
it from my chauffeur.

1314
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:38,715
He will write you a check
for $10,000 on my account,

1315
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:40,918
if you dare ask him.

1316
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:46,523
Goodbye for six months.

1317
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:50,193
(instrumental variation of
"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix")

1318
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:05,676
(The Billionaire Theme)

1319
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:13,517
- Hey, what...

1320
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:17,387
What do you want?

1321
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:18,622
What are you doin' here?

1322
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,257
- I want employment.

1323
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,526
A man told me I should find it here.

1324
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:23,927
I am destitute.

1325
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:26,630
- That is not the way to get employment,

1326
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,466
sticking your nose into
places that don't concern you.

1327
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:30,300
Get out.

1328
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:33,971
There's no one workin'
here besides my wife and I.

1329
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,907
- You lie!

1330
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:40,310
There are four women and two
young men working in there.

1331
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,812
Who employs them?

1332
01:09:41,812 --> 01:09:44,881
- Is that the way you talk to me?

1333
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,950
You think a lot of yourself, don't you?

1334
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,385
Just what do you take me for?

1335
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:49,586
- A worm!

1336
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:52,155
- Take care, Joe.

1337
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:53,523
He's an inspector.

1338
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,658
Look at his shoes!

1339
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,261
- I am not an inspector,

1340
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:01,098
and what is the matter with my shoes?

1341
01:10:01,098 --> 01:10:04,935
- Well, sir, could a young man
looking for minimum wage work

1342
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:06,570
afford shoes like those?

1343
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:11,842
I assure you, we don't employ anyone here.

1344
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:13,276
We're only caretakers.

1345
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:17,147
- But I saw six people.

1346
01:10:17,147 --> 01:10:17,981
- Where?

1347
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,150
Not a soul.

1348
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,119
Search the whole damn basement.

1349
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:24,221
- Joe, please!

1350
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:26,223
Don't speak to the gentleman like that.

1351
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:29,960
So you see, sir, not a soul.

1352
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:34,598
- There's a smell.

1353
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,667
You have given them a signal to hide.

1354
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,669
You are breaking the law.

1355
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:43,673
Give me some work or I will
call an inspector right away!

1356
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:45,842
- Look here, mister.

1357
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,477
Can't we arrange this?

1358
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,446
What good does it do you
to get me into trouble

1359
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:51,915
and to shut up my little shop?

1360
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,551
- What good will it do me to say nothing?

1361
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:57,954
- Well, what about $100 a week?

1362
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:00,223
- I cannot live on $100 a week!

1363
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:02,959
- You can if you look around a bit.

1364
01:11:03,894 --> 01:11:05,462
There are others, you know.

1365
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:07,497
- Give me the address of the others.

1366
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:09,366
If I am to live by blackmail,

1367
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:11,902
I must have an extended practice.

1368
01:11:11,902 --> 01:11:13,603
- Well, if I have to pay,

1369
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,739
I don't see why the others shouldn't too.

1370
01:11:15,739 --> 01:11:17,841
So will you take 100?

1371
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,745
Look here.

1372
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:23,146
Look at it.

1373
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,147
(bill crinkles)

1374
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:24,981
Listen to it.

1375
01:11:26,817 --> 01:11:31,688
It's yours, and another
hundred every Wednesday,

1376
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:34,157
if you keep the inspector off me.

1377
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:38,662
- It's no use waving a
$100 bill in my face,

1378
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:40,997
I am accustomed to them.

1379
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,699
And I feel convinced that you will pay

1380
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,535
at least 350 if I insist!

1381
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:49,473
- Oh, please, sir, have
a little feeling for us.

1382
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:52,008
You have no idea how
much we struggle to live!

1383
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:54,177
- Here, we're not beggars.

1384
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,416
I will pay you exactly what
the business can afford

1385
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,684
and not a dollar more.

1386
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:03,386
You seem to know we can afford 350,

1387
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:08,358
so you must also know that
we cannot afford any more.

1388
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:10,927
Take this 350 and be damned with you.

1389
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:13,697
- Now, Joe, let's not get hasty.

1390
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:14,731
- You shut up.

1391
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:19,064
You think you can beg him down
a hundred or two? You can't.

1392
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:22,467
I can size up a tough lot
without looking at his shoes.

1393
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:25,003
He's got us, and he knows he's got us!

1394
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:30,409
- I don't like this blackmailing business.

1395
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,177
Of course, if I must, I must,

1396
01:12:32,177 --> 01:12:37,182
but...can't you give me some manual work?

1397
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:38,951
- You want to get a little deeper

1398
01:12:38,951 --> 01:12:40,786
into our business, don't you?

1399
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,189
- I am as deep as I can go already.

1400
01:12:44,189 --> 01:12:45,824
You are employing six
young people in there,

1401
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:49,628
who are no doubt making
less than minimum wage!

1402
01:12:49,628 --> 01:12:51,997
Except that the sanitary arrangements

1403
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:53,832
are probably abominable,

1404
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:56,268
there is nothing more for me to know.

1405
01:12:56,268 --> 01:12:59,705
I have you in the hollow of my hand.

1406
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:02,140
Give me some work to live by

1407
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:06,211
or I will have you cleared
out like a wasp's nest!

1408
01:13:06,211 --> 01:13:08,814
- I have a good mind to clear out now

1409
01:13:08,814 --> 01:13:12,918
and take up somewhere where
you won't find me so easy.

1410
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:14,519
I'm used to changing my address.

1411
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:18,824
- That is the best card in your hand.

1412
01:13:18,824 --> 01:13:20,692
You have some business ability!

1413
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:25,364
But tell me, why can't you
give me work to live by,

1414
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:27,266
just as you give it, I suppose,

1415
01:13:27,266 --> 01:13:30,035
to the young people I saw in there?

1416
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:32,704
- I don't like the people
I employ to know too much!

1417
01:13:33,572 --> 01:13:35,040
- I see.

1418
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,409
They might call in the inspector!

1419
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:39,711
- Call the inspector?

1420
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,813
(laughing)

1421
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:46,051
What kind of fool are you?

1422
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:49,221
They dread the inspector more than I do.

1423
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:50,422
- Why?

1424
01:13:50,422 --> 01:13:53,058
Don't they want to be protected?

1425
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:54,960
- The inspector wouldn't
protect them, sir,

1426
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,428
he'd only shut up the place

1427
01:13:56,428 --> 01:13:58,263
and take their jobs from them.

1428
01:13:58,263 --> 01:14:00,766
If they thought that you could be so cruel

1429
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,000
as to report them,

1430
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,637
they'd be down on their
knees to you to spare them.

1431
01:14:05,637 --> 01:14:08,240
- You that know so much ought to know

1432
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,210
that a business like this
can't afford luxuries.

1433
01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:14,379
It's a cheap labor business.

1434
01:14:14,379 --> 01:14:16,948
As long as I get people to
work for their natural wage,

1435
01:14:16,948 --> 01:14:19,651
I can get by, but no luxuries, mind you.

1436
01:14:19,651 --> 01:14:24,089
- And just what is a person's
natural wage according to you?

1437
01:14:24,089 --> 01:14:27,459
- $5.85 an hour for a 12 hour day.

1438
01:14:28,493 --> 01:14:29,328
- Slavery!

1439
01:14:29,328 --> 01:14:33,465
- Oh no, sir, nobody
could call that slavery.

1440
01:14:33,465 --> 01:14:37,202
- Can a person live on $420 a week?

1441
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:39,338
- [Joe] Of course one can.

1442
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:40,772
What's preventing 'em?

1443
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:43,942
- Well, I will work even for that,

1444
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:47,412
to prove that I can
work and support myself.

1445
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:51,283
So give me work and be done talking!

1446
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:52,918
- Who started talking?

1447
01:14:52,918 --> 01:14:53,752
You or I?

1448
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:55,854
- I did!

1449
01:14:57,856 --> 01:15:01,693
I thank you for the
information you have given me.

1450
01:15:01,693 --> 01:15:04,663
It has been instructive and to the point.

1451
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:07,632
Is that a sufficient apology?

1452
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,403
And now to work, to work.

1453
01:15:11,403 --> 01:15:13,672
I am in a hurry to get to work!

1454
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,408
- What kind of work can you do?

1455
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:19,811
- Can you use a sewing machine?

1456
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,713
Can you make a buttonhole?

1457
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:23,248
- Certainly not.

1458
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:25,250
I don't call that work.

1459
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,153
- Well, what kind of work do you want?

1460
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:30,255
- Brain work.

1461
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,656
- [Joe] (laughs) He's crazy!

1462
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,192
- Your work.

1463
01:15:34,192 --> 01:15:37,295
Managing work, planning
work, driving work.

1464
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:40,565
Let me see what you make there.

1465
01:15:40,565 --> 01:15:42,067
Tell me how you dispose of it.

1466
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:47,205
- The man in the truck
comes and takes them away.

1467
01:15:47,205 --> 01:15:48,907
- Does he pay you for them?

1468
01:15:48,907 --> 01:15:49,708
- No.

1469
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,510
He gives us a receipt.

1470
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:53,779
Mr. Superflew pays us for the receipts

1471
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:55,013
at the end of the week.

1472
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:58,550
- And what does Mr.
Superflew do with the coats?

1473
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,685
- He takes them to the wholesaler

1474
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:03,088
who supplies the cloth for him.

1475
01:16:03,088 --> 01:16:04,790
The truck brings us the cloth

1476
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,425
when it picks up the finished clothes.

1477
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:10,061
- Why don't you deal directly
with the wholesalers?

1478
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:11,963
- Oh, no, that wouldn't be right.

1479
01:16:11,963 --> 01:16:16,034
We don't know who they are
and Mr. Superflew does.

1480
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,769
Besides, we can't afford a truck!

1481
01:16:17,769 --> 01:16:21,440
Not even an old, weathered
truck like that one.

1482
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,042
- [Victor] And does Mr.
Superflew own the truck?

1483
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,178
- No, that wouldn't be right.

1484
01:16:26,178 --> 01:16:29,848
He hires it out by the hour from Bolton's.

1485
01:16:29,848 --> 01:16:33,318
- And is the driver always the same man?

1486
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:36,087
- Yes, always old Tim Goodman.

1487
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:41,426
- Write those names down for me.

1488
01:16:41,426 --> 01:16:44,729
Bolton's, Superflew, Goodman.

1489
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,099
- Look here.

1490
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:50,202
I'm not your secretary, you know.

1491
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:51,203
- You will be, soon.

1492
01:16:52,103 --> 01:16:52,938
Do as I tell you.

1493
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:56,174
- Well, of all the nerve!

1494
01:16:56,174 --> 01:17:00,278
- Now, when Goodman comes round next,

1495
01:17:00,278 --> 01:17:04,416
tell him to tell Bolton's
that he has found somebody

1496
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,752
who will buy the truck for $1,500.

1497
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,256
Tell him that if he can induce Bolton's

1498
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,191
to part from it at that figure,

1499
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:15,994
you will give him $200 for himself

1500
01:17:15,994 --> 01:17:19,664
and engage him at $100
advance on his present wages

1501
01:17:19,664 --> 01:17:23,802
to drive just the same old
round to the same places.

1502
01:17:23,802 --> 01:17:25,637
He knows the wholesalers.

1503
01:17:27,873 --> 01:17:32,477
Mr. Superflew (laughs) is superfluous!

1504
01:17:33,378 --> 01:17:36,147
We shall collect not only our own stuff,

1505
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:39,451
but that of all the other sweatshops.

1506
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:40,785
- Sweatshops!

1507
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:43,455
Who are you calling sweatshops?

1508
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:46,424
- Man, know thyself!

1509
01:17:46,424 --> 01:17:49,628
You sweat yourself, you
sweat your poor wife,

1510
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:51,696
you sweat those poor
young people in there,

1511
01:17:51,696 --> 01:17:54,099
you live on sweat.

1512
01:17:54,099 --> 01:17:56,001
- That's no way to talk about it.

1513
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:56,935
It isn't right.

1514
01:17:57,936 --> 01:18:02,073
I pay the right wages, same
as everybody else pays.

1515
01:18:02,073 --> 01:18:04,976
And I give employment to the likes of them

1516
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:06,745
that couldn't make it themselves!

1517
01:18:06,745 --> 01:18:09,180
- You are sensitive about it.

1518
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,982
I am not.

1519
01:18:10,982 --> 01:18:14,719
I am going to sweat Mr.
Superflew out of existence!

1520
01:18:15,687 --> 01:18:18,189
I am going to sweat Mr. Timothy Goodman

1521
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:20,659
instead of allowing Mr.
Superflew to sweat him.

1522
01:18:21,726 --> 01:18:22,694
- Look here.

1523
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:25,697
Does this business belong to me or to you?

1524
01:18:27,465 --> 01:18:28,266
- We shall see.

1525
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:32,103
Dare you buy the truck?

1526
01:18:32,103 --> 01:18:34,072
- Where's the money to come from?

1527
01:18:34,072 --> 01:18:36,041
- Where does all the money come from?

1528
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:37,375
From the bank!

1529
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,314
- (laughs) You got to put
it there first, haven't you?

1530
01:18:42,314 --> 01:18:44,215
- Not in the least.

1531
01:18:44,215 --> 01:18:47,652
Other people put it there
and the bank lends it to you

1532
01:18:47,652 --> 01:18:51,189
if it thinks you know how
to extend your business.

1533
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:55,660
- Oh, Joe, don't trust
your money in a bank.

1534
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,263
No good has come out of
banks for the likes of us.

1535
01:18:58,263 --> 01:18:59,798
Don't let him tempt you!

1536
01:19:00,966 --> 01:19:03,668
- When had you last a holiday, my dear?

1537
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:05,437
- Me, a holiday?

1538
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:09,140
I can't afford a holiday!

1539
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:12,143
I had one when my brother
brought his little daughter

1540
01:19:12,143 --> 01:19:14,379
to New York, 10 years ago.

1541
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:17,716
- Then it required your
brother to impregnate a woman

1542
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:22,320
to give you one holiday
in your entire adult life!

1543
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,756
I can do better for you than that.

1544
01:19:24,756 --> 01:19:27,258
- We don't understand
that sort of talk here.

1545
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,895
We have no time for it.

1546
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:35,667
Please, take our little
present, and go away.

1547
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:37,802
(horn honks)

1548
01:19:37,802 --> 01:19:39,838
- That's Tim, for the clothes.

1549
01:19:39,838 --> 01:19:41,539
- Sit down.

1550
01:19:41,539 --> 01:19:42,741
I will deal with Tim.

1551
01:19:51,549 --> 01:19:54,619
- Don't listen to him, Joe.

1552
01:19:54,619 --> 01:19:56,621
Don't let him meddle with our lives.

1553
01:20:02,527 --> 01:20:05,897
- Listen, mister, let's
have an understanding.

1554
01:20:05,897 --> 01:20:07,932
- No understanding is necessary.

1555
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:12,137
Tim is sure that Bolton's
will take 1,250 for the truck.

1556
01:20:12,137 --> 01:20:12,971
(Joe's wife crying)

1557
01:20:12,971 --> 01:20:14,739
Tim is my devoted slave.

1558
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:19,978
Oh, do stop that poor woman
from howling if you can.

1559
01:20:23,048 --> 01:20:24,416
I'm going now.

1560
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,584
There is not enough work here for me.

1561
01:20:26,584 --> 01:20:29,654
I can do it all in half a day every week!

1562
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:32,090
I will take a job
washing dishes at a hotel

1563
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:34,225
to fill up my time.

1564
01:20:34,225 --> 01:20:38,063
But first, I must go round to
the address Tim has given me

1565
01:20:38,063 --> 01:20:40,665
and arrange that we send
them our stuff direct,

1566
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:43,601
and then collect, just as Superflew did.

1567
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:45,103
When I have arranged everything with them,

1568
01:20:45,103 --> 01:20:47,739
I will come back and
arrange everything for you!

1569
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:52,277
Meanwhile, carry on as usual.

1570
01:20:52,277 --> 01:20:53,111
Good day.

1571
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:58,383
- It's like a sort of dream to me.

1572
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:01,786
I don't know what to do.

1573
01:21:02,721 --> 01:21:04,355
- Do what he says, Joe.

1574
01:21:06,524 --> 01:21:07,525
We're like children.

1575
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:12,030
- Isn't this a dream, Hector?

1576
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:13,798
- It's lovely, darling.

1577
01:21:13,798 --> 01:21:15,967
- Nothing beats a fine
weekend on the lake!

1578
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:18,036
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1579
01:21:18,036 --> 01:21:20,472
I hope you're finding
everything here to your liking.

1580
01:21:20,472 --> 01:21:22,407
- It's the loveliest, most peaceful hotel.

1581
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:24,476
But what have you done to the old place?

1582
01:21:24,476 --> 01:21:26,377
When I was here last, a year ago,

1583
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:28,713
it was an old pub called
'The Sow and Whistle'?

1584
01:21:28,713 --> 01:21:31,116
- Oh, it was so until quite lately, sir.

1585
01:21:31,116 --> 01:21:32,851
My parents kept the old sow, right back

1586
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,386
to the days of Rudolph Valentino.

1587
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:38,823
Our old guestbook is filled
with numerous signatures

1588
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:41,025
of stars throughout the decades!

1589
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:44,963
Everyone from Joan
Crawford to Audrey Hepburn.

1590
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:48,600
But it was on its last
legs when you saw it, sir.

1591
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,636
- Well, you have made a
first rate job of it now.

1592
01:21:51,636 --> 01:21:52,804
- Oh, it wasn't my doing, sir.

1593
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:54,205
I'm only the Manager.

1594
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:56,908
You'd hardly believe it if I
were to tell you the story.

1595
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:58,276
- Well, fire ahead, my dear!

1596
01:21:59,377 --> 01:22:01,179
- One day a boy came in here,

1597
01:22:01,179 --> 01:22:03,715
looking for a job washing dishes.

1598
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:05,683
My poor old father hadn't
the nerve to turn him down,

1599
01:22:05,683 --> 01:22:09,020
so he said that he might just
try him for a day or two.

1600
01:22:09,020 --> 01:22:13,725
So the boy washed two
dishes and he broke six.

1601
01:22:13,725 --> 01:22:16,294
My mother was furious.

1602
01:22:16,294 --> 01:22:17,962
She said since the boy had broken them,

1603
01:22:17,962 --> 01:22:19,430
he should have to pay for them

1604
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,033
even if he had to have the
price taken out of his wages.

1605
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:24,769
So off went the boy and he came
back with a load of crockery

1606
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:26,704
that made my mother cry.

1607
01:22:26,704 --> 01:22:28,373
She said that we'd be the laughing stock

1608
01:22:28,373 --> 01:22:31,676
of the state of New York if we
served a meal on such things.

1609
01:22:31,676 --> 01:22:36,080
But the very next day, a
European lady came back

1610
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,549
and bought them right off the table

1611
01:22:37,549 --> 01:22:39,717
for three times the actual value.

1612
01:22:39,717 --> 01:22:42,053
My mother never dared
say another word to him.

1613
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:44,789
That boy took things into his own hands

1614
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:47,759
in a way that we could have never done.

1615
01:22:47,759 --> 01:22:52,430
It was cruel, but it was the truth.

1616
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,132
- What's cruel about
getting nice crockery?

1617
01:22:54,132 --> 01:22:56,434
- Oh, it wasn't only that, sir.

1618
01:22:56,434 --> 01:22:59,103
But what was wrong with
the old Sow and Whistle was

1619
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:02,373
not the thick old plate that
took away your appetite away.

1620
01:23:02,373 --> 01:23:04,309
It was the people that it had gathered

1621
01:23:04,309 --> 01:23:08,947
who had never been up to
much by modern standards.

1622
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:11,583
The boy told them the
truth about themselves

1623
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,085
and I couldn't deny it!

1624
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:16,287
My father was at his wits' end trying

1625
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:17,822
to pay off the mortgage.

1626
01:23:17,822 --> 01:23:19,457
And the next thing we knew,

1627
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:21,492
the boy paid off the mortgage,

1628
01:23:21,492 --> 01:23:23,728
and got the banks off us completely.

1629
01:23:25,096 --> 01:23:26,865
"It's time for you two
to sell and retire...

1630
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:28,933
...you're doing no good
here!" he had said.

1631
01:23:30,034 --> 01:23:32,337
- That's dreadful, to
root them out like that.

1632
01:23:32,337 --> 01:23:34,939
- It was hard, but he was right.

1633
01:23:34,939 --> 01:23:38,843
Here I was, ashamed of the
place, with no prospects.

1634
01:23:38,843 --> 01:23:43,748
And now here I am - with
a salary and a percentage

1635
01:23:43,748 --> 01:23:46,084
more than anything I
could have ever dreamt of!

1636
01:23:47,118 --> 01:23:49,020
- Then he didn't chuck you, my dear.

1637
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,154
- No, sir.

1638
01:23:50,154 --> 01:23:51,856
You see, I was intelligent enough to know

1639
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:54,292
that the boy was always right.

1640
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:57,061
I backed him up 100%!

1641
01:23:57,061 --> 01:23:58,897
Everything that that boy touches,

1642
01:23:58,897 --> 01:24:02,500
it just, it turns into
gold every single time.

1643
01:24:03,368 --> 01:24:06,604
A wonderful young man,
one day washing dishes,

1644
01:24:06,604 --> 01:24:09,240
and the next an owner
of a first class hotel!

1645
01:24:10,408 --> 01:24:12,410
- And are your folks happy and satisfied?

1646
01:24:13,544 --> 01:24:17,415
- Well, they have all the
comfort that they need.

1647
01:24:17,415 --> 01:24:19,884
And it was the best thing for them.

1648
01:24:19,884 --> 01:24:20,718
Business is business

1649
01:24:20,718 --> 01:24:22,820
and there's no room for sentiment in it!

1650
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,223
- Well, that is a very moving story,

1651
01:24:26,324 --> 01:24:27,926
more so than you think, my dear,

1652
01:24:27,926 --> 01:24:30,194
because I happen to know
a man by that stamp.

1653
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:33,798
Oh, by the way, I asked
a friend of mine to come

1654
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:36,200
and join us for the
weekend - a Mr. Sagamore.

1655
01:24:37,201 --> 01:24:38,736
You can find a room for him, I suppose?

1656
01:24:38,736 --> 01:24:41,539
- That will be quite
alright, sir, thank you.

1657
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:44,075
- Are there many guests staying
at the hotel this weekend?

1658
01:24:44,075 --> 01:24:44,976
- Less than usual, sir.

1659
01:24:44,976 --> 01:24:48,046
We have a doctor who
takes his meals here -

1660
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,315
very quiet, not a word to anyone.

1661
01:24:50,315 --> 01:24:52,216
And then we have another
gentleman, an invalid,

1662
01:24:52,216 --> 01:24:54,385
who was just discharged from the hospital.

1663
01:24:54,385 --> 01:24:56,154
The doctor recommended our chef here,

1664
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:58,723
so he takes his meals here as well.

1665
01:24:58,723 --> 01:25:00,925
- Well, we must put up
with them, I suppose.

1666
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,101
- Sir, you came up this morning

1667
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:05,036
without signing the register.

1668
01:25:05,036 --> 01:25:05,870
I brought it up.

1669
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:06,704
Would you be so kind?

1670
01:25:06,704 --> 01:25:07,572
- Of course, I forgot.

1671
01:25:15,213 --> 01:25:16,014
There you are.

1672
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:16,881
- Thank you very much, sir.

1673
01:25:18,783 --> 01:25:19,851
Oh, indeed, sir!

1674
01:25:19,851 --> 01:25:20,852
We are honored.

1675
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:21,686
- Anything wrong?

1676
01:25:21,686 --> 01:25:24,288
- The proprietor of this
hotel was once married

1677
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:25,456
to a Mr. Fitzfassenden.

1678
01:25:25,456 --> 01:25:26,958
- What?

1679
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:28,126
Get me out of here.

1680
01:25:28,126 --> 01:25:28,960
Pack up, Hector!

1681
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,328
My bill, please, instantly!

1682
01:25:30,328 --> 01:25:31,162
- Certainly, sir.

1683
01:25:31,162 --> 01:25:33,097
But may I say that he's
not on the premises,

1684
01:25:33,097 --> 01:25:35,199
and I do not expect him this weekend?

1685
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,035
- Don't fuss, darling.

1686
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:38,302
We certainly have a right to be here

1687
01:25:38,302 --> 01:25:39,303
just as much as anyone else,

1688
01:25:39,303 --> 01:25:41,472
if we pay our way. Come on. Please!

1689
01:25:41,472 --> 01:25:43,741
- Very well, very well.

1690
01:25:43,741 --> 01:25:44,642
Have it your way.

1691
01:25:46,044 --> 01:25:47,745
But my weekend is spoilt!

1692
01:25:47,745 --> 01:25:48,746
- He won't be here, sir.

1693
01:25:48,746 --> 01:25:51,115
He's getting tired of
paying us unexpected visits

1694
01:25:51,115 --> 01:25:53,184
now that he knows that he can count on me.

1695
01:25:56,154 --> 01:25:57,422
Your friend Mr. Sagamore, sir,

1696
01:25:57,422 --> 01:25:59,424
coming up with the invalid gentleman.

1697
01:26:10,468 --> 01:26:12,036
- Alex!

1698
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:13,971
Mr. Rodriguez.

1699
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:17,408
What does this mean, Sagamore?

1700
01:26:17,408 --> 01:26:19,710
You never told me who you
were bringing me to see,

1701
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:22,313
you said two friends.

1702
01:26:22,313 --> 01:26:23,681
- What has happened to you, man?

1703
01:26:23,681 --> 01:26:26,017
What have you done to yourself?

1704
01:26:26,017 --> 01:26:29,287
- Everybody asks what
I have done to myself.

1705
01:26:29,287 --> 01:26:32,523
I haven't done anything to myself.

1706
01:26:32,523 --> 01:26:36,227
I suppose you mean this and this?

1707
01:26:36,227 --> 01:26:40,465
Well, they are what your
husband has done to me.

1708
01:26:40,465 --> 01:26:43,234
- Wow, I'm awfully sorry, man.

1709
01:26:43,234 --> 01:26:44,869
- Oh, you're really kind,

1710
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:47,271
but I can't accept the
privilege of a friend

1711
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:49,207
and at the same time be a plaintiff

1712
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:51,275
in an action for assault and battery!

1713
01:26:51,275 --> 01:26:52,443
- Yes, you can, bro.

1714
01:26:52,443 --> 01:26:53,711
The situation isn't new.

1715
01:26:53,711 --> 01:26:55,713
The victims are always
coming to us for sympathy.

1716
01:26:55,713 --> 01:26:56,981
Make yourself comfortable.

1717
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:03,754
- Well, the truth of the matter is

1718
01:27:03,754 --> 01:27:05,790
that Mr. Blenderbland won't be reasonable,

1719
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:06,958
and I was hoping you two might help me

1720
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:08,359
bring him to his senses.

1721
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:10,161
- It's no use, Sagamore.

1722
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:12,964
2.5 million.

1723
01:27:12,964 --> 01:27:14,098
And costs.

1724
01:27:14,098 --> 01:27:15,533
Not a dollar less.

1725
01:27:15,533 --> 01:27:16,868
- Too much!

1726
01:27:16,868 --> 01:27:18,469
Ridiculous.

1727
01:27:18,469 --> 01:27:19,871
A jury might give 500,000

1728
01:27:19,871 --> 01:27:21,506
if there were a clear
disablement from earning,

1729
01:27:21,506 --> 01:27:23,941
or if the defendant had
attacked you with a weapon.

1730
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:25,443
But you are only a sleeping member

1731
01:27:25,443 --> 01:27:27,378
in the firm your father founded.

1732
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:29,480
You don't really earn your money.

1733
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:32,216
Besides, hang it all.

1734
01:27:32,216 --> 01:27:35,953
Mr. di Parerga is a very
dramatic young man, to be sure,

1735
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:37,588
but he's not a cruel person,

1736
01:27:37,588 --> 01:27:38,923
and I don't think you
can persuade any jury

1737
01:27:38,923 --> 01:27:41,125
that he injured you in cold blood.

1738
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:43,828
- Why didn't you give him a
punch in the solar plexus?

1739
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:47,598
- Physically harm someone?

1740
01:27:47,598 --> 01:27:48,366
Impossible.

1741
01:27:48,366 --> 01:27:49,534
- Bullshit!

1742
01:27:49,534 --> 01:27:50,535
If a man becomes violent,

1743
01:27:50,535 --> 01:27:52,436
he must take what he gets and deserves.

1744
01:27:52,436 --> 01:27:55,940
- Well, unfortunately I
have neither your skill

1745
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:58,676
nor your knowledge of how to punch.

1746
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:01,212
But I will take lessons when I am well.

1747
01:28:01,212 --> 01:28:03,381
And he will pay for them.

1748
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:07,151
2,500,000!

1749
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:09,487
And medical expenses!

1750
01:28:09,487 --> 01:28:10,721
And costs!

1751
01:28:10,721 --> 01:28:13,024
- And cab fare to the hospital, I suppose.

1752
01:28:13,024 --> 01:28:16,294
- No, I went in his own car.

1753
01:28:16,294 --> 01:28:20,198
But now you remind me,
I did tip the chauffeur.

1754
01:28:20,198 --> 01:28:22,066
Now don't misunderstand me.

1755
01:28:22,066 --> 01:28:25,503
It's not the money, but I
won't be beaten by a rich man.

1756
01:28:25,503 --> 01:28:28,839
It's a point of honor, of self-respect!

1757
01:28:30,308 --> 01:28:35,313
It was a brutal, unprovoked,
cowardly assault.

1758
01:28:35,446 --> 01:28:38,049
- Was it quite unprovoked?

1759
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:41,385
- I'm extremely sorry, sir,

1760
01:28:41,385 --> 01:28:42,587
but my proprietor is here with the doctor.

1761
01:28:42,587 --> 01:28:44,355
I really did not expect him.

1762
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:50,695
- You have allowed my husband

1763
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:53,931
to bring another man to my
hotel and enjoy themselves here.

1764
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:54,832
You are fired!

1765
01:28:54,832 --> 01:28:56,367
- [Manager] I am so sorry,
sir, but I didn't know

1766
01:28:56,367 --> 01:28:57,969
that this gentleman was your husband.

1767
01:28:57,969 --> 01:28:59,604
But you're always right.

1768
01:28:59,604 --> 01:29:01,639
Do you wish me to go at once or carry on

1769
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:03,507
until you find someone to replace me?

1770
01:29:05,376 --> 01:29:08,913
- I do not wish you to go
at all, you are re-engaged.

1771
01:29:08,913 --> 01:29:11,148
Throw them both out, instantly!

1772
01:29:11,148 --> 01:29:11,983
(laughs)

1773
01:29:11,983 --> 01:29:13,217
- Your manager cannot throw Alexander out.

1774
01:29:13,217 --> 01:29:15,620
He could throw us all
out, if it came to that.

1775
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:18,389
And as for Mr. Rodriguez,
this is a licensed house

1776
01:29:18,389 --> 01:29:21,359
and he has as much right
to be here as you or I.

1777
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:23,928
- I will set the hotel
on fire if necessary!

1778
01:29:27,365 --> 01:29:28,733
Hello.

1779
01:29:28,733 --> 01:29:30,167
What is this?

1780
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:32,103
Adrian here too?

1781
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:34,138
What has happened to you?

1782
01:29:34,138 --> 01:29:35,506
What are those sticks for?

1783
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:38,142
Send the doctor here at once.

1784
01:29:40,611 --> 01:29:42,179
Did you hurt yourself?

1785
01:29:43,814 --> 01:29:45,216
- Hurt myself?

1786
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,217
Hurt myself?

1787
01:29:47,585 --> 01:29:49,253
- Has he been run over?

1788
01:29:50,354 --> 01:29:51,789
- This man has half killed me,

1789
01:29:51,789 --> 01:29:54,458
and he asks if I have hurt myself.

1790
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:58,663
I fell down that whole flight of stairs.

1791
01:29:58,663 --> 01:29:59,997
My ankle was sprained.

1792
01:29:59,997 --> 01:30:00,998
My knee was twisted.

1793
01:30:00,998 --> 01:30:02,733
The small bone in my leg was broken.

1794
01:30:02,733 --> 01:30:05,569
I ricked my spine.

1795
01:30:05,569 --> 01:30:08,906
- But why didn't you
walk downstairs properly?

1796
01:30:08,906 --> 01:30:09,907
Were you drunk?

1797
01:30:09,907 --> 01:30:10,741
- I-

1798
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:12,843
- He declares that his
injuries were inflicted by you

1799
01:30:12,843 --> 01:30:14,645
when you last met, Mr. di Parerga.

1800
01:30:14,645 --> 01:30:15,680
- By me?

1801
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:17,948
Am I a prizefighter?

1802
01:30:17,948 --> 01:30:19,884
Am I a coal-heaver?

1803
01:30:19,884 --> 01:30:20,718
- Both.

1804
01:30:20,718 --> 01:30:22,253
- Do you deny that you assaulted him?

1805
01:30:22,253 --> 01:30:24,088
- Of course I deny it.

1806
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:26,223
Anything more monstrous I never heard.

1807
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:30,961
What happened was that he
insulted my father grossly,

1808
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:33,097
without the slightest provocation,

1809
01:30:33,097 --> 01:30:35,433
at a moment when I had every reason

1810
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:38,903
to expect the utmost tenderness from him.

1811
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:42,440
- I am not going to be
talked out of my case.

1812
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,175
- What do you mean by your case?

1813
01:30:45,609 --> 01:30:47,445
- He has a case action against you.

1814
01:30:47,445 --> 01:30:48,279
- An action?

1815
01:30:49,413 --> 01:30:53,217
Very well, you know my invariable rule.

1816
01:30:53,217 --> 01:30:55,953
Fight him to the last ditch,
no matter what it costs.

1817
01:30:55,953 --> 01:30:57,955
Take him to the Supreme
Court if necessary!

1818
01:30:59,323 --> 01:31:03,160
We shall see whose wallet
will hold out the longest.

1819
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,030
I will not be blackmailed!

1820
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:10,868
- Do you think your father's
money places you above the law?

1821
01:31:10,868 --> 01:31:12,303
- Again!

1822
01:31:12,303 --> 01:31:14,672
- No, no, no, no, we'll have none of that.

1823
01:31:14,672 --> 01:31:16,540
Toko, my boy, toko.

1824
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,541
- [Julius] Toko?

1825
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:18,542
What is toko?

1826
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:19,877
- He knows.

1827
01:31:19,877 --> 01:31:22,880
Toko is an infallible medicine
for calming the nerves.

1828
01:31:23,781 --> 01:31:25,983
A punch in the solar plexus
and a day in bed, that's toko.

1829
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:29,186
- Okay, why don't we all step outside,

1830
01:31:29,186 --> 01:31:30,688
get a breath of fresh air?

1831
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,022
- Yes, go on.

1832
01:31:32,022 --> 01:31:35,326
Insult me, threaten me, blackmail me.

1833
01:31:35,326 --> 01:31:37,328
You can all do it with impunity now.

1834
01:31:37,328 --> 01:31:40,131
- Don't take it that way, Mr. di Parerga.

1835
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:42,867
There is no question of
insulting or blackmailing you.

1836
01:31:42,867 --> 01:31:43,734
I just want to settle this business

1837
01:31:43,734 --> 01:31:45,836
of Mr. Blenderbland's
injuries before I move on

1838
01:31:45,836 --> 01:31:47,838
to the matrimonial question.

1839
01:31:47,838 --> 01:31:50,207
- I want to hear no
more of Mr. Blenderbland

1840
01:31:50,207 --> 01:31:52,743
and his ridiculous injuries!

1841
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:55,112
- Be reasonable, Mr. di Parerga.

1842
01:31:55,112 --> 01:31:57,782
How do I address the
compensation due Mr. Blenderbland

1843
01:31:57,782 --> 01:32:00,284
if we don't mention his injuries?

1844
01:32:00,284 --> 01:32:03,854
- There is no compensation
due to Mr. Blenderbland.

1845
01:32:03,854 --> 01:32:06,357
He deserved what he
got, whatever that was.

1846
01:32:07,358 --> 01:32:08,859
- But he will take an action against you.

1847
01:32:08,859 --> 01:32:10,795
- Take one against him first.

1848
01:32:10,795 --> 01:32:12,029
- What for?

1849
01:32:12,029 --> 01:32:14,965
- For anything, only
don't bother me about it!

1850
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,936
Claim $20 million damages.

1851
01:32:18,936 --> 01:32:21,872
I tell you I will not be blackmailed!

1852
01:32:21,872 --> 01:32:23,908
- Neither will I.

1853
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:26,944
I am entitled to compensation
and I will have it!

1854
01:32:26,944 --> 01:32:29,280
- Please, please, steady.

1855
01:32:30,748 --> 01:32:32,850
I cannot advise either
of you to go to court...

1856
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:35,853
but quite seriously, Mr. di Parerga,

1857
01:32:35,853 --> 01:32:39,089
Mr. Blenderbland is entitled
to some compensation.

1858
01:32:39,089 --> 01:32:40,591
You can afford it.

1859
01:32:40,591 --> 01:32:41,425
- Mr. Sagamore,

1860
01:32:42,927 --> 01:32:47,031
a young man as rich as I
am cannot afford anything.

1861
01:32:47,031 --> 01:32:51,068
I have to fight to keep
every dollar I possess.

1862
01:32:51,068 --> 01:32:54,104
Every beggar, every
blackmailer, every swindler,

1863
01:32:54,104 --> 01:32:57,441
every charity, every testimonial,
every political cause,

1864
01:32:57,441 --> 01:32:59,343
every league and
brotherhood and sisterhood,

1865
01:32:59,343 --> 01:33:01,378
every church and chapel, every institution

1866
01:33:01,378 --> 01:33:04,181
of every kind on earth is
busy from morning to night

1867
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:05,783
trying to bleed me to death.

1868
01:33:07,184 --> 01:33:10,654
My standing instructions to
you are to defend every action

1869
01:33:10,654 --> 01:33:12,790
and to forestall every claim for damages

1870
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,960
by a counterclaim for 10 times the amount.

1871
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,797
That is the only way that
I can write across the sky:

1872
01:33:19,797 --> 01:33:22,032
"Hands off my money!"

1873
01:33:22,032 --> 01:33:25,836
- [Julius] You see, Mr.
Blenderbland, it's no use.

1874
01:33:25,836 --> 01:33:28,305
You must withdraw your
threat of an action.

1875
01:33:28,305 --> 01:33:29,139
- I won't.

1876
01:33:30,574 --> 01:33:31,475
- You will.

1877
01:33:31,475 --> 01:33:35,012
Mr. di Parerga, he can
do nothing against you.

1878
01:33:35,012 --> 01:33:37,815
Let me make an appeal on
his behalf ad misericordiam.

1879
01:33:37,815 --> 01:33:39,316
- Oh, we are wasting time,

1880
01:33:39,316 --> 01:33:41,585
and I have more important
business to settle!

1881
01:33:42,553 --> 01:33:45,589
Give him $2,000 and have done with it.

1882
01:33:45,589 --> 01:33:46,423
- $2,000?

1883
01:33:48,192 --> 01:33:49,627
- Oh, Mr. di Parerga.

1884
01:33:49,627 --> 01:33:53,163
- Yes, $2,000.

1885
01:33:53,163 --> 01:33:56,667
No man can refuse $2,000

1886
01:33:56,667 --> 01:34:00,704
when you crackle all those
$100 bills under his nose.

1887
01:34:01,705 --> 01:34:03,107
- He wants 2,500,000.

1888
01:34:05,776 --> 01:34:06,877
- Two mill-

1889
01:34:06,877 --> 01:34:09,880
- Not a dollar less.

1890
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:16,921
- Adrian, darling, I have underrated you.

1891
01:34:16,921 --> 01:34:19,156
Your cheek, your gluttony,

1892
01:34:19,156 --> 01:34:22,760
your obstinacy impose respect on me.

1893
01:34:23,894 --> 01:34:27,231
I threw a half baked gentleman downstairs,

1894
01:34:27,231 --> 01:34:29,833
and my chauffeur picked up on the mat

1895
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:32,870
a magnificently complete skunk!

1896
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:35,072
- Five million for that,
Sagamore, do you hear?

1897
01:34:35,072 --> 01:34:36,640
- Please, please, keep your temper.

1898
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,776
- Keep your own temper.

1899
01:34:38,776 --> 01:34:40,444
Has he lamed you for life?

1900
01:34:40,444 --> 01:34:42,246
Has he raised a lump on your head?

1901
01:34:42,246 --> 01:34:44,548
Has he called you a skunk?

1902
01:34:44,548 --> 01:34:46,350
- No, but he might at any moment.

1903
01:34:47,751 --> 01:34:51,255
- (laughs) My Sagamore!

1904
01:34:51,255 --> 01:34:52,189
Mio tesoro!

1905
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:55,225
Shall I give him five million on condition

1906
01:34:55,225 --> 01:34:57,795
that he turns it into a
billion in six months?

1907
01:34:57,795 --> 01:35:00,297
- I will do what I like with it.

1908
01:35:00,297 --> 01:35:03,167
I will have it unconditionally.

1909
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:05,436
- Mr. Blenderbland, it is
a mistake to go into court

1910
01:35:05,436 --> 01:35:08,739
in the character of a man
who has been called a skunk.

1911
01:35:08,739 --> 01:35:11,609
It makes the jury see you in
that light from the very start.

1912
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,346
It is also very difficult for
a plaintiff to get sympathy

1913
01:35:15,346 --> 01:35:16,847
in the character of a fully grown man

1914
01:35:16,847 --> 01:35:19,683
who has been thrashed by
another fully grown man.

1915
01:35:20,684 --> 01:35:23,754
If Mr. di Parerga had
stabbed you, or shot you,

1916
01:35:23,754 --> 01:35:25,990
or poisoned you, that would
have been quite in order,

1917
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:28,592
it would not have
compromised your dignity.

1918
01:35:30,494 --> 01:35:32,229
But Mr. di Parerga knows better.

1919
01:35:33,397 --> 01:35:36,233
He knows the privileges of
his gender and his status

1920
01:35:36,233 --> 01:35:38,736
down to a hair's breadth
and never oversteps them.

1921
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:42,473
He will come into court
impeccably dressed,

1922
01:35:42,473 --> 01:35:43,474
looking his best.

1923
01:35:43,474 --> 01:35:46,744
No man is more refined and more graceful

1924
01:35:47,578 --> 01:35:49,980
when it is his cue to play
the perfect gentleman.

1925
01:35:51,548 --> 01:35:54,985
Long before we can even
get your case on the books,

1926
01:35:54,985 --> 01:35:57,388
that bump on your head will have subsided,

1927
01:35:57,388 --> 01:35:58,455
your broken bone will have set,

1928
01:35:58,455 --> 01:36:01,158
and the color will have
come back into your cheeks.

1929
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:03,560
So unless you can provoke Mr. di Parerga

1930
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,996
to assault you again the
day before the trial,

1931
01:36:05,996 --> 01:36:08,832
which he is far too clever for,

1932
01:36:08,832 --> 01:36:12,569
the chances against you
are a billion to one.

1933
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:14,071
- That's right, Blenderbland.

1934
01:36:14,071 --> 01:36:16,407
You haven't a dog's chance!

1935
01:36:16,407 --> 01:36:18,509
Next time you see his fist
coming in your direction,

1936
01:36:18,509 --> 01:36:20,177
duck and counter.

1937
01:36:20,177 --> 01:36:22,780
If you don't get that
satisfaction, you won't get any.

1938
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:25,182
- Alexander's right, Mr. Blenderbland.

1939
01:36:25,182 --> 01:36:29,853
But perhaps if you ask
Mr. di Parerga nicely,

1940
01:36:29,853 --> 01:36:32,189
he'll pay your expenses.

1941
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:38,629
- Is there any justice for a
regular guy against a rich man?

1942
01:36:40,698 --> 01:36:42,032
- Believe me, no.

1943
01:36:43,767 --> 01:36:45,035
Not against a billionaire.

1944
01:36:47,538 --> 01:36:50,074
- And what justice is
there for a billionaire,

1945
01:36:50,074 --> 01:36:51,575
I should like to know?

1946
01:36:51,575 --> 01:36:53,010
- In courts...

1947
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:54,778
- I am not thinking of the courts,

1948
01:36:54,778 --> 01:36:57,848
there is little justice there for anybody.

1949
01:36:57,848 --> 01:37:01,051
My $2.3 billion is in itself an injustice.

1950
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,923
I speak of the Justice of Heaven!

1951
01:37:05,923 --> 01:37:07,691
- Oh, Lord, now we're in for it!

1952
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:12,827
- Alexander, how can you jeer at me?

1953
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:16,731
Is it just that I, because
I am a billionaire,

1954
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:19,567
cannot keep my spouse,
cannot keep even a lover,

1955
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:22,070
cannot keep anything but my money?

1956
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,877
There you sit before my very eyes,

1957
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:33,047
snuggling up to that
insignificant little nothingness,

1958
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:36,050
who cannot even afford to
pay for his own thongs,

1959
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:39,187
and you are happy and he is happy.

1960
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:46,894
Here is this suit of
clothes on two sticks.

1961
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:49,163
What does it contain?

1962
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:51,332
- [Adrian] Leave me alone, will you?

1963
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:55,036
- Something that once resembled a man,

1964
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,605
something that liked lending me $5 notes

1965
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,241
and never asked me to repay them.

1966
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,409
Why?

1967
01:38:01,409 --> 01:38:03,277
Kindness to me?

1968
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:05,013
Love of me?

1969
01:38:05,013 --> 01:38:10,018
No, the swank of a poor man
lending to a billionaire!

1970
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:13,888
In my divine wrath, I smashed him

1971
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:17,358
as a child smashes a disappointing toy.

1972
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:22,964
And when he was beaten
down to his real self,

1973
01:38:22,964 --> 01:38:26,367
I found I was not a
potential boyfriend to him,

1974
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:28,703
but a bank account with a good cook.

1975
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:32,540
- That's all very fine, deary,

1976
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:35,043
but the truth is no one can live with you.

1977
01:38:38,179 --> 01:38:40,782
- And anyone can live with you.

1978
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:49,223
And apparently you can live with anybody.

1979
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:50,758
- [Alexander] What Hector
says is God's truth.

1980
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:52,527
Nobody can live with you.

1981
01:38:52,527 --> 01:38:54,562
- But why, why, why?

1982
01:38:54,562 --> 01:38:56,130
- Mr. di Parerga, be reasonable.

1983
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:59,600
Can anyone live with a tornado?

1984
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,169
An avalanche, an earthquake?

1985
01:39:01,169 --> 01:39:02,570
- Yes!

1986
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:05,473
Thousands of people live
on the slopes of volcanoes,

1987
01:39:05,473 --> 01:39:07,041
in the tracks of avalanches,

1988
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,977
on land thrown up only
yesterday by earthquakes.

1989
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:16,417
But with a billionaire who
can rise to his destiny

1990
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:21,289
and wield the power his
money gives him, no.

1991
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:25,026
Well, so be it.

1992
01:39:28,596 --> 01:39:32,867
I will live in utter loneliness,
and keep myself sacred

1993
01:39:32,867 --> 01:39:34,869
until I find the right man!

1994
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,940
A man who can stand with
me on the utmost heights

1995
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:41,342
and not lose his head.

1996
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:44,011
The mate created for me in Heaven!

1997
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,014
He must be somewhere.

1998
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:50,251
- (The Doctor) The manager
says I am wanted here.

1999
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:52,086
Who wants me?

2000
01:39:54,288 --> 01:39:55,857
- I want you!

2001
01:39:55,857 --> 01:39:56,691
Come here.

2002
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,561
- Something wrong with
your blood pressure, yes?

2003
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:04,799
Wow, I had never heard a
voice like yours before,

2004
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,602
and I have never felt such a pulse.

2005
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,972
It is like a slow sledge hammer.

2006
01:40:10,972 --> 01:40:14,609
- Well, is my pulse my fault?

2007
01:40:14,609 --> 01:40:16,110
- No.

2008
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:17,545
It is the will of God.

2009
01:40:17,545 --> 01:40:19,647
All our pulses are part
of the will of God.

2010
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:22,116
- Now don't be silly, Doc.

2011
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:22,984
I don't know what things
are like in Europe,

2012
01:40:22,984 --> 01:40:24,819
but anyone in America will tell you

2013
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:27,088
that Science and God
simply don't go together.

2014
01:40:27,088 --> 01:40:29,157
I can assure you that a
great many of your patients

2015
01:40:29,157 --> 01:40:31,492
over here would not want to
hear you talk about God at all!

2016
01:40:31,492 --> 01:40:34,829
- That does not disconcert
God in the least, my friend.

2017
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:38,166
The pulse beats still, slow, strong,

2018
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:43,104
just as your voice rang
clear, steady, and strong

2019
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:44,572
when you sang to me that day.

2020
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:51,112
You are a terrible man,
but I loved your voice,

2021
01:40:51,112 --> 01:40:55,216
and now I must say, I love your pulse.

2022
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:56,984
I've never felt anything like that.

2023
01:40:58,653 --> 01:40:59,754
- Well, fancy that.

2024
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:00,821
I can understand loving
someone for his voice,

2025
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,658
but he actually loves him for his pulse.

2026
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:04,892
- I am a doctor.

2027
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,494
Men as you fancy them are nothing

2028
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,995
but bundles of ailments to me.

2029
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:12,867
But the life, the pulse,
is the heartbeat of God.

2030
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:17,238
A beautiful voice is the gift of God.

2031
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:23,978
- My pulse will never change.
This is the love I crave for!

2032
01:41:25,479 --> 01:41:27,481
I will marry you.

2033
01:41:31,152 --> 01:41:34,388
And I will sing to you every
day, if you want me to.

2034
01:41:37,325 --> 01:41:41,662
Mr. Sagamore, see about a special license

2035
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:43,998
the moment you have got rid of Alexander.

2036
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,535
- I am afraid it is not possible.

2037
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:50,705
We are bound by our vows.

2038
01:41:52,406 --> 01:41:56,577
- Well, have I not passed
your mother's test?

2039
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:58,713
You shall have an
accountant's certificate.

2040
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:02,617
I learned in the first half
hour of my search for employment

2041
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:04,719
that the living wage
for a single person is

2042
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,822
approximately $350 a week.

2043
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:09,724
Before the end of the week,

2044
01:42:09,724 --> 01:42:12,493
I had made enough to support
me for a hundred years.

2045
01:42:13,761 --> 01:42:16,430
I did it honestly and legitimately.

2046
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,499
I explained the way in which it was done.

2047
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:21,902
- Had you added $1 an hour

2048
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:23,704
to the wages of those sweated workers,

2049
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:26,507
that wicked business would
have crashed on your head.

2050
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:28,175
You sold it to the man Superflew

2051
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:29,610
for the last quarter of his savings

2052
01:42:29,610 --> 01:42:31,279
and those workers still work for him

2053
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:33,281
for less than minimum wage an hour.

2054
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:36,284
- You cannot change the
market price of labor,

2055
01:42:36,284 --> 01:42:38,819
not the Lord himself can do that.

2056
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:43,424
But I came to this hotel to wash dishes,

2057
01:42:43,424 --> 01:42:45,793
the most incompetent scullery maid

2058
01:42:45,793 --> 01:42:47,561
that ever broke a dinner service.

2059
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,630
(laughs)

2060
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,464
I am now its owner

2061
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:52,700
and there is no minimum wage an hour here!

2062
01:42:54,669 --> 01:42:56,070
- But what of those old people

2063
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,906
whose natural home this place had become?

2064
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:01,075
They've been cast out into
the homeless shelters.

2065
01:43:01,075 --> 01:43:03,411
- I have to take the world as I find it.

2066
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:06,647
- The wrath of God shall overtake those

2067
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:09,317
who leave the world no
better than they found it.

2068
01:43:09,317 --> 01:43:12,653
- I think God loves those who make money!

2069
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,855
- All the evidence
suggests that, certainly.

2070
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:17,858
- But all this talk is idle.

2071
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,194
This gentleman has easily
fulfilled the conditions

2072
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:21,329
imposed by my mother,

2073
01:43:21,329 --> 01:43:25,032
but I have not fulfilled
the conditions imposed

2074
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,834
by this gentleman's father.

2075
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,669
- You need not worry about that.

2076
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:31,405
The six months have not yet expired.

2077
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:35,509
I will show you how to turn
your $10,000 into 3 million.

2078
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:36,344
- You cannot.

2079
01:43:38,012 --> 01:43:38,846
It is gone.

2080
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:42,683
- Oh, you can't have spent it all,

2081
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:44,985
you who live like a church mouse!

2082
01:43:48,556 --> 01:43:51,625
There must be some of it left.

2083
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:52,693
- Not a dollar.

2084
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:54,295
Not a quarter.

2085
01:43:56,030 --> 01:43:56,864
The Lord -

2086
01:43:56,864 --> 01:43:57,932
- Oh, bother the Lord!

2087
01:43:57,932 --> 01:43:59,533
What did you do with it?

2088
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:01,435
- The Lord is never bothered.

2089
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:06,407
On that afternoon after you
left me to earn your own living,

2090
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:09,410
I sat down and took in a newspaper.

2091
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:12,680
While scanning the pages,
I saw a familiar name.

2092
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,917
It was that of the teacher
who changed my whole life

2093
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,252
and gave me a new soul

2094
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:21,088
by opening up the world of Science to me.

2095
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:23,924
I was his assistant for four years.

2096
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:26,427
He would make his own
apparatus for his experiments,

2097
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:29,196
and one day he needed a filament of metal

2098
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:30,698
that would stand a temperature

2099
01:44:30,698 --> 01:44:33,634
that melted platinum like sealing wax.

2100
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:36,404
- Buy his patent for me if
it has not been snapped up!

2101
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:38,939
- He never took out a patent.

2102
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:41,375
He believed that knowledge
is no man's property.

2103
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:45,713
The company he worked for
made hundreds of millions

2104
01:44:45,713 --> 01:44:47,114
of dollars off his discovery

2105
01:44:48,682 --> 01:44:50,284
by people who care nothing about knowledge

2106
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,619
and everything about money!

2107
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,756
He left $30,000 and a widow.

2108
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:58,926
The good woman was like
a second mother to me.

2109
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:06,333
$8 a day at most, which is less
than minimum wage per hour.

2110
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:11,338
- That comes of marrying
an incompetent dreamer.

2111
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,775
Are you going to beg for her?

2112
01:45:14,775 --> 01:45:18,012
I warn you I am tired of destitute widows.

2113
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:20,748
I should be a beggar myself

2114
01:45:20,748 --> 01:45:22,683
if I took them all on my shoulders.

2115
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:24,652
- Have no fear.

2116
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,320
The Lord heard the widow's prayer.

2117
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,590
I went to the president of the firm

2118
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:30,825
and told him that it was the will of God

2119
01:45:30,825 --> 01:45:34,028
that she should have a widow's pension.

2120
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:35,830
She received it.

2121
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:38,332
But all this took time!

2122
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:41,168
The illness, the nurse, the funeral

2123
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:42,536
had left her without anything.

2124
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:45,172
Between the pensions and the death,

2125
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:48,275
there was a gap exactly $10,000 wide.

2126
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,478
He who is just and exact supplied that sum

2127
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,613
by your chauffeur's
hands and then by mine.

2128
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,750
It rejoiced my heart as money
had never rejoiced it before!

2129
01:45:59,253 --> 01:46:01,555
- Well, man, you may have
not done a lot for yourself,

2130
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:04,859
but you have done damn well for the widow.

2131
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:07,528
And you escaped Vicki.

2132
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:10,264
He won't marry you with
your pockets empty.

2133
01:46:10,264 --> 01:46:12,600
- Oh, really now?

2134
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,768
$3 million must have been made

2135
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:17,538
out of that discovery
scores of times over!

2136
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,442
The doctor, in putting my money

2137
01:46:21,442 --> 01:46:23,577
into the widow's necessary expenses,

2138
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:26,881
may be said to have made
a retrospective investment

2139
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:28,415
in the discovery!

2140
01:46:28,415 --> 01:46:32,553
And he has shown the greatest
ability in the affair,

2141
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:33,988
has he not, Mr. Sagamore?

2142
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,323
- Unquestionably.

2143
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:38,592
He has settled the widow's
affairs to perfection.

2144
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:43,497
- My mind is made up. I
will marry this doctor!

2145
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:49,503
Ascertain his name and make
the necessary arrangements.

2146
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:53,207
- You take care, doctor.

2147
01:46:53,207 --> 01:46:56,677
He is unfaithful in wanting to marry you.

2148
01:46:56,677 --> 01:46:59,713
He flirted with me, brought me here,

2149
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:03,884
and made me believe that I was
to be Alexander's successor,

2150
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:06,787
before he ever saw you!

2151
01:47:06,787 --> 01:47:08,789
And now look at what he's done to me!

2152
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:12,226
And he will do the same to you

2153
01:47:12,226 --> 01:47:14,929
when the next man catches his fancy.

2154
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:18,032
- What have you to say to that?

2155
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:23,470
- You must learn to take
chances in this world!

2156
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,308
This disappointed gay philanderer tries

2157
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:30,444
to frighten you with my unfaithfulness.

2158
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,148
He has never been married. I have.

2159
01:47:34,148 --> 01:47:37,251
And I tell you that in the
very happiest marriages

2160
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:42,256
not a day passes without 1,000
moments of unfaithfulness.

2161
01:47:43,824 --> 01:47:47,127
You begin by thinking you
have only one spouse...

2162
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:48,562
you find you have a dozen.

2163
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:51,765
There is the creature you hate and despise

2164
01:47:51,765 --> 01:47:55,836
and are tied to for life,
and before breakfast is over,

2165
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:58,105
the fool says something nice

2166
01:47:58,105 --> 01:48:02,109
and becomes the man whom
you admire and love,

2167
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:06,714
and between these extremes
there are 1,000 degrees

2168
01:48:06,714 --> 01:48:09,984
with a different pair of
spouses at each of them.

2169
01:48:11,952 --> 01:48:14,521
A husband is all men to his spouse,

2170
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:19,226
he is everything that is devilish
- the thorn in your flesh,

2171
01:48:19,226 --> 01:48:23,464
the jealous schoolboy, the
detective dogging your movements,

2172
01:48:23,464 --> 01:48:25,699
the complainer, the scolder, the worrier.

2173
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:30,738
But he has only to tell
you an affectionate lie,

2174
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:36,644
and he becomes your comfort, your helper,

2175
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:40,781
at best your greatest treasure,

2176
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:46,353
at worst your troublesome
but beloved child.

2177
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:56,630
All spouses, regardless of
gender or sexual orientation,

2178
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:58,766
are all these people in one!

2179
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,603
What do the unmarried know

2180
01:49:02,603 --> 01:49:06,640
of this infinitely
dangerous, heart tearing,

2181
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:11,245
ever changing life of adventure
that we call marriage?

2182
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:19,520
Face it as you would face
a dangerous operation.

2183
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,725
Have you not performed hundreds of them?

2184
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:30,964
- To be sure, there is
no wit and no wisdom

2185
01:49:30,964 --> 01:49:33,033
like that of an individual
ensnaring the mate

2186
01:49:33,033 --> 01:49:34,368
chosen for him by God.

2187
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:38,172
Yet I am very happy as I am.

2188
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:40,741
Why shall I change?

2189
01:49:41,608 --> 01:49:43,477
I should be a very happy old bachelor.

2190
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:49,283
- Can you feel my pulse
every day as an old bachelor?

2191
01:49:53,787 --> 01:49:55,622
- I had forgotten about the pulse.

2192
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:03,864
- Or hear my voice every
day as an old bachelor?

2193
01:50:09,937 --> 01:50:12,539

playing from Victor's phone)

(sings 2nd half Saint-Saëns'
"Mon cœur s'ouvre à ta voix")

2195
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,387
- That voice!

2196
01:52:40,387 --> 01:52:42,289
The depth of feeling, those eyes!

2197
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:45,692
And yes, the pulse too.

2198
01:52:46,927 --> 01:52:51,164
It is irresistible. It is a
pulse in a hundred thousand, I -

2199
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:53,233
I love it!

2200
01:52:54,635 --> 01:52:58,071
And you're right, I cannot give it up.

2201
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,309
And that majestic voice has haunted me

2202
01:53:02,309 --> 01:53:04,278
since the first time I heard you sing.

2203
01:53:05,545 --> 01:53:08,482
At first, I thought you
were a modern day siren,

2204
01:53:08,482 --> 01:53:12,052
a gay man's siren, sent to
tempt me and lure me astray.

2205
01:53:13,487 --> 01:53:15,289
You've just stripped yourself
of all conceit and pride

2206
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:16,757
in front of all these people,

2207
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:20,427
and borne your heart and
soul to me with your singing!

2208
01:53:20,427 --> 01:53:25,432
- You just might turn out
to be my heart and my soul.

2209
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,635
My father used to be both,

2210
01:53:29,603 --> 01:53:32,973
and while his passing away broke my heart

2211
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:34,808
and pierced my soul,

2212
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:40,948
I think you may be the angel
he sent me to heal both.

2213
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:44,885
- And I suppose one can say

2214
01:53:44,885 --> 01:53:48,221
that you are the chaste and
pure angel my mother sent me!

2215
01:53:49,089 --> 01:53:51,959
You certainly have the virtues
and the voice of an angel,

2216
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,661
if not always the temperament.

2217
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,730
