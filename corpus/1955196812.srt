00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,998
The world's climate scientists tell us that

3
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:46,337
the highest save level of emissions
would be around 350 ppm CO<s>2</s>

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,380
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
and we're already at 400.

5
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:57,882
They tell us that the safest we could hope to do
without having perilous implications,

6
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:02,623
as far as drought, famine, human
conflict, major species extinction

7
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:07,204
would be about a 2°C
increase in temperature.

8
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,000
We are rapidly approaching that

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,230
and with the all the built-in carbon
dioxide that's already in the atmosphere,

10
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:15,421
we're easily going to exceed that.

11
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,989
On our watch we are facing the
next major  extinction of species on the earth

12
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:26,711
that we haven't seen since
the time of the dinosaurs disappearing.

13
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,449
When whole countries go under water
because of sea level rise,

14
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:35,042
when whole countries find there's so much drought
that they can't feed their population,

15
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,310
and as a result they need to

16
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:41,200
desperately migrate to another country
or invade another country...

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,610
We are gonna have climate
wars in the future.

18
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,743
<i>What about…</i>

19
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,781
<i>what about livestock
and animal agriculture?</i>

20
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:54,060
Well, what about it.. I mean...

21
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:24,967
My name is Kip.

22
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,068
This is me.

23
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,254
I had a cliché
US American childhood.

24
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:29,464
My mom was a teacher,

25
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:30,893
my dad was in the military,

26
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,548
and I have one sister.

27
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,668
I played all the sports growing up but
always loved the outdoors and camping.

28
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:37,669
Life was simple.

29
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,949
Not a care in the world.

30
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:41,853
And then this guy showed up.

31
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,771
Like so many of us, I saw his film
"An Inconvenient Truth"

32
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,569
about the impacts of global
warming and it scared the emojis out of me.

33
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,074
In Al Gore's film he describes
how our earth is in peril.

34
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:54,896
Climate change stands for the fact
that all life on this planet,

35
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:55,967
from monster storms,

36
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,257
raging wild-fires,

37
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:58,181
record droughts,

38
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,407
icecaps melting,

39
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,340
acidification
of the oceans,

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,431
to entire countries
going underwater,

41
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,519
that could all be caused by
human's demands on the Earth.

42
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,845
With scientists warning that unless
we take drastic measures

43
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,888
to correct our
environmental footprint

44
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:13,225
our time on this planet

45
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,221
may be limited to
only 50 more years.

46
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,417
I wanted to do everything
I could to help.

47
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,701
I made up my mind right then
and there to change how I lived

48
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,019
and to do whatever I
possibly could to find

49
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,109
a way for all of us to live together,

50
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,510
in balance with the planet

51
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,537
sustainably,

52
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:30,991
forever.

53
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:33,716
I started to do all the things
Al told us to do.

54
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,089
I became an OCE.

55
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,954
"Obsessive-Compulsive Environmentalist"

56
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:40,157
I separated the trash and recycled,

57
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:40,957
I composted,

58
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:42,313
changed all the light bulbs,

59
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,313
took short showers,

60
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,175
turned the water off when
I brushed my teeth,

61
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,070
turned off lights
when leaving the room,

62
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,503
and rode my bike instead
of driving, everywhere.

63
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:52,833
But as the years went by it seemed
as if things were getting worse.

64
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,833
I had to wonder:

65
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,212
with all the continuing ecological
crises facing the planet,

66
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,721
even if every single one of us
adopted these conservation habits,

67
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:04,080
was this really going to be
enough to save the world?

68
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:08,274
It just seemed there
was something more to the story.

69
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:11,637
I thought I was doing everything
I could to help the planet.

70
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:16,983
But then, with one friend's
post, everything changed.

71
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,500
The post sent me to a report online,
published by the United Nations

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,366
stating that cows produce
more greenhouse gases

73
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:26,208
than the entire transportation sector.

74
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,400
This means that raising cattle
produces more greenhouse gases

75
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:33,550
than all cars, trucks, trains,
boats, planes combined.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,867
13% compared to 18%
from livestock.

77
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,943
This is because cows produce
a substantial amount of methane

78
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:41,609
from their digestive process.

79
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:46,381
Methane gas from livestock
is 25-100 times more destructive

80
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,432
than carbon dioxide
from vehicles.

81
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,755
I'd been riding my bike everywhere
to help reduce emissions

82
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:55,612
but it turns out there is more
to climate change than just fossil fuels.

83
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,063
I started doing more research.

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,149
The UN along with other
agencies recorded that

85
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,786
not only did livestock play a
major role in global warming,

86
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,609
it is also the leading cause
of resource consumption

87
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,900
and environmental degradation
destroying the planet today.

88
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,778
How was it possible I wasn't aware of this?

89
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,953
I thought this information would be plastered
everywhere in the environmental community.

90
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:19,090
I went to the nation's largest
environmental organisations' websites.

91
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,100
350.org, Greenpeace,

92
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,159
Sierra Club, Climate Reality,
Rainforest Action Network, Amazon Watch…

93
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,217
and was shocked to see they
had virtually nothing on animal agriculture.

94
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:29,940
What was going on?

95
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,731
Why would they not have this
information on there?

96
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,873
It seemed the main focus for many of
those groups was natural gas and oil production,

97
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:41,374
with fracking being the latest hot issue,
due to water usage and contamination.

98
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,766
Hydraulic fracturing for natural gas
uses an incredible amount of water.

99
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:49,390
A staggering 375 billion litres of water is
consumed each year in the US.

100
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,899
But when I compare this with animal agriculture

101
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:57,190
raising livestock just in the
US consumes 130 trillion litres of water.

102
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,440
And it turns out the methane emissions
from both industries are nearly equal.

103
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:05,815
Living in California, a state
plagued by drought and water shortages,

104
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,299
water use is a major
concern for many of us.

105
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:14,148
(PACIFIC INSTITUTE)
The average Californian uses about
5700 litres per person, per day.

106
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,857
About half of that is related
to consuming meat and dairy products.

107
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:22,074
Meat and dairy products
are incredibly water-intensive,

108
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,882
in part because the animals
use very water-intensive grains,

109
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,678
that's what they eat.

110
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:33,823
So all of the water embedded
in grain, and that the animals eats

111
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,482
is essentially considered part of the virtual
water footprint of that product.

112
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:42,270
I found out a one 110 gram hamburger

113
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:45,731
requires over 2500 litres
of water to produce.

114
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,815
Here I'd been taking these short
showers trying to save water,

115
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,800
to find out that
eating just one hamburger

116
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,473
is the equivalent of showering
two entire months.

117
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,315
So much is attention is given
to lowering our home water use,

118
00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:00,790
yet domestic water use is only
5% of what is consumed in the US

119
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:03,357
versus 55% for animal agriculture.

120
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,315
This is because it takes
upwards to 9500 litres of water

121
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:08,565
to produce 450 grams of beef.

122
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:12,565
I went on the government's department of water
resources' "Save Our Water" campaign,

123
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,172
where it outlines behaviour changes
to help conserve our water.

124
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:17,975
Like using low-flow shower
heads, efficient toilets,

125
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:21,274
water-saving appliances and
fix leaky faucets and sprinkler heads

126
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,606
but nothing about animal agriculture.

127
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:28,245
When I added up all governments' recommendations,
I was saving 180 litres a day.

128
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,433
Still that's not even close to the
2500 litres for just one burger.

129
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:36,890
I wanted to see if I could somehow talk
with the government about this.

130
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,682
Just calling to see if we
could schedule an interview.

131
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,074
<i>Yeah, that would be good.</i>

132
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,565
<i> What does your schedule look like this afternoon
or tomorrow afternoon? </i>

133
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:50,897
Tomorrow afternoon could be good.

134
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,986
(Chief Water Use and Efficiency Branch)
For the urban environment there are a lot of things that can be done.

135
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:05,298
Indoors, using low-flow shower heads,

136
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,857
low-flow faucets, efficient toilets,

137
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:12,606
efficient water-using appliances.

138
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:16,523
All those are really good areas can help quite a lot.

139
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,340
But the biggest water
savings is from outdoors.

140
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,701
We have to be mindful
about the way we use water.

141
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:26,546
We have to use it as
efficiently as possible.

142
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:32,082
We have to protect its quality and have to be
good stewards of the environment that depends on water.

143
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:38,376
And checking the sprinkler. A lot of times
we get leaks and broken sprinklers…

144
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,740
Things like that
wastes water.

145
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:46,240
Those are the areas where
there is a lot of room for conservation.

146
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:52,531
<i>It kept on coming up a
lot was about animal agriculture…</i>

147
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,986
<i>Can you comment on that
at all about how much that</i>

148
00:08:56,986 --> 00:09:03,207
<i>plays a role in water
consumption and pollution.</i>

149
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,931
That's not my area…

150
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:18,135
<i>There's one study that found that
producing a pound of beef...</i>

151
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,606
<i>9500 litres of water.</i>

152
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:22,481
- Yes.
- Yes.

153
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:28,657
<i>Eggs 1800 litres of water.
Cheese almost 3400 litres.</i>

154
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:32,265
<i>Isn't it simple, why isn't it on "Save Our Water"?</i>

155
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,386
<i>It's kind if you went
to someone's house</i>

156
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:37,949
<i>and my neighbour
has a faucet dripping</i>

157
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,065
<i>and then you see a giant
hose turned full blast</i>

158
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:47,399
<i>until 2500 litres of water
shout out in the street</i>

159
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,857
<i>flooding the entire street.</i>

160
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,990
<i>I think I would say:
"Hey, you know, turn that off, please."</i>

161
00:09:54,557 --> 00:09:57,572
<i>Seems it could be a huge
thing that we could be doing,</i>

162
00:09:57,707 --> 00:10:00,348
<i>by far more than anything else.</i>

163
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,232
<i>If that is really the case.</i>

164
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,976
I think that the water footprint

165
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:10,370
of animal husbandry is greater
than other activities.

166
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:13,748
Without a doubt.

167
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,350
<i>That would be really powerful.</i>

168
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:19,357
<i>Rather than waiting until we really
are in a drought, just start now</i>

169
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:22,307
<i>and tell whoever is in charge of
"Save Our Water", say</i>

170
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:25,174
<i>"Let's start to encourage people
to eat less meat</i>

171
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,923
<i>because these studies
are coming up."</i>

172
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:31,606
- I don't think that will happen.
<i>- Why?</i>

173
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,690
- I don't think that'll happen.
<i>- Why?</i>

174
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:39,207
Because the way government
is organised here.

175
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,357
<i>It's interesting, why though?</i>

176
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:51,692
One is water management,
the other behaviour change.

177
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,665
<i>Behaviour of taking showers</i>

178
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:58,799
<i>and not watering your
lawn, that is behaviour.</i>

179
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,873
Yes.

180
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:07,411
Clearly the government did
not want talk about this issue.

181
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,581
Their inability to answer

182
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,246
along with the environmental
organisations' silence

183
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,660
on animal agriculture,

184
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:15,157
made it seem something
more was going on.

185
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:18,273
I started investigating more about
the impact of livestock

186
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,995
and found that the situation
was worse than I had thought.

187
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:25,543
In 2009, two advisors from the
World Bank released an analysis

188
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,427
on human-induced
greenhouse gases,

189
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,326
finding that animal agriculture

190
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:32,795
was responsible not for 18%
as the UN stated,

191
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:36,629
but for 51% of all
greenhouse gases.

192
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,009
51%.

193
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,757
Yet all we hear about
is burning fossil fuels.

194
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,223
This devastating figure is due to
clear-cutting rainforest for grazing,

195
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:46,915
respiration and all the
waste animals produced.

196
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,340
This makes animal agriculture the number one

197
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,222
contributor to human-caused climate change.

198
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,826
But not only that, I found
that raising animals for food

199
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:58,007
consumes 1/3 of all the planet's fresh water,

200
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:02,111
occupies up to 45%
of the Earth's land.

201
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:05,623
Is responsible for up to 91%
of the Amazon destruction,

202
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,865
Is the leading cause of
species extinction,

203
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,540
ocean "dead zones",

204
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:14,265
and habitat destruction.

205
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:17,550
Yet the world's largest
environmental groups

206
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,090
that are suppoed be saving our world
didn't mention this anywhere.

207
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:26,123
I had to speak with environmental organisations to find out
why they weren't addressing this issue.

208
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,365
I sent off dozens of emails,
made call after call.

209
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:29,757
Spent hours on hold.

210
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,220
Days became weeks and
weeks became months

211
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,490
and for some reason, no-one
wanted to talk to me about this.

212
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:36,673
So bizarre.

213
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,607
I supported these organisations
so long and now I was met with silence.

214
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:45,157
I was however able to connect with a handful
of environmentalist authors

215
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,997
and advocates that were
willing to address this issue.

216
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:52,699
I took my old trusty van Super Blue out
of retirement and hit the road.

217
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:56,175
So my calculations are that

218
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:02,957
without using any gas, oil
or fuel, ever again, from this day forward,

219
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:08,404
that we would still exceed our
maximum carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions,

220
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:11,659
565 gigatons, by
the year 2030.

221
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:16,305
Without the electricity sector or the
energy sector even factoring in the equation,

222
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:19,381
all simply by raising and
eating livestock.

223
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:25,612
If you reduce the amount of methane emissions,
the level in the atmosphere goes down fairly quickly.

224
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:26,489
Within decades.

225
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:30,323
As opposed to CO<s>2</s>, if you reduce
the emissions to the atmosphere

226
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:33,474
you don't really see a signal in the atmosphere
for a 100 years or so.

227
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:41,234
The single largest contributor to every
known environmental ill known to human kind:

228
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:44,380
deforestation, land use,
water scarcity,

229
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:48,706
destabilisation of communities, world hunger…
The list doesn't stop.

230
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:51,781
It's an environmental
disaster that's being ignored

231
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:55,315
by the very people who
should be championing.

232
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:59,712
Free-living animals 10,000 years
ago made up 99% of the biomass.

233
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:03,499
Human beings made up only
1% of the biomass.

234
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:08,140
Today, only 10,000 years later,
which is only a fraction of time,

235
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:12,881
we human beings and
the animals we own as property,

236
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,990
make up 98% of the biomass.

237
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:19,669
And wild free-living
animals make up only 2%.

238
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:24,198
We basically have completely
stolen the world, Earth,

239
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,321
from free-living animals
to use for ourselves,

240
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:30,157
and our cows, pigs, chickens
and factory-farmed fish

241
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:33,098
and the oceans are
even more devastated.

242
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:36,856
Concerned researchers of
the loss of species agree

243
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:41,919
that the primary cause of loss of
species on our earth that we are witnessing,

244
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,323
is due to overgrazing and habitat loss
from livestock production on land

245
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,057
and by overfishing, which I
call fishing in our oceans.

246
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:54,523
We are in the middle of the largest mass
extinction of species in 65 million years.

247
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:58,265
The rain forest is being cut down
at 4000 m2 per second.

248
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,449
The driving force behind all of
this is animal agriculture.

249
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,884
Cutting down the forest to graze animals
and to grow soya beans.

250
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:11,273
Genetically engineered soya beans to feed to the cows, pigs,
factory-farmed chickens and fish.

251
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:17,711
91% of loss of rainforest in
the Amazon area thus far to date

252
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:21,957
91% that has been destroyed
is due to raising livestock.

253
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:26,887
The leading cause of environmental
destruction is animal agriculture.

254
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:28,554
I just couldn't understand why the

255
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,932
world's largest environmental organisations
weren't addressing this

256
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,231
when their entire mission is
to help protect the environment.

257
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,093
<i>That's the thing too, they say:</i>

258
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,840
<i>"Use less coal, ride your bike…"</i>

259
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,310
<i>- What about "eat less meat"?</i>
- Yeah.

260
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,365
I think they focus-grouped it
and it's a political loser.

261
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:50,315
They are membership
organisations.

262
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,915
They want to maximise the number
of people making contributions

263
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,138
and if they are getting
identified as anti-meat

264
00:15:57,138 --> 00:16:01,580
or challenging people on their everyday habits,
something that is so dear to people,

265
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,331
it will hurt with their fundraising.

266
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:10,928
They don't want to address the primary driving
cause of environmental devastation,

267
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,328
which is animal agriculture,
because they're businesses.

268
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,874
They want to make sure that they have
a reliable  source of funding.

269
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:25,830
I got invited to a meeting with
Al Gore some years ago now

270
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,762
and met his methane arguments
but he was really push-back.

271
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:29,957
That's just his argument:

272
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:32,994
"It's hard enough to get
people to think about CO2."

273
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,032
"Don't confuse them."

274
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,864
I think that the problem with a lot
of the organisations is that they're focused

275
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:45,450
and have a laser focus, they don't go
off-message because they don't want to piss off

276
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:48,718
another whole group of people that will
make their lives difficult.

277
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:54,948
If you listen to the majority of the major environmental
organisations, they're not telling you to do much,

278
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:59,550
besides "live life the way you've been living it, but
change the light bulb from time to time,

279
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,620
drive less, use less
plastic, recycle more…"

280
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:06,524
It's better for their
fundraising and better for their profile

281
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:09,951
to create a victim-
and-perpetrator sort of plotline.

282
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:15,413
It's like when we talk about the fact
that when we have a dysfunctional family.

283
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:20,065
The father is an alcoholic. It's
the one thing no one talks about.

284
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,471
Everyone goes around that,

285
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:26,568
yet it's the one thing that causes the
devastation in the relationships in the family.

286
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:29,223
Because nobody wants
talk about it.

287
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,572
How can these organisations not know?

288
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,811
The issue is right in front of them,
unmistakable at this point.

289
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:39,988
And just like these organisations fall over
themselves to show the general public

290
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:42,442
that climate change is human-caused

291
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:47,784
and in doing so completely fail to see
what's right in front of them:

292
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:51,604
that animal agriculture, raising
and killing animals for food

293
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,973
is really what's killing the planet.

294
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,546
That was it. No more e-mails, no more
phone calls, I had enough.

295
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,190
I realised that if I wanted answers,

296
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,316
I would have to go to these
organisations headquarters in person.

297
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,431
GREENPEACE
San Francisco Headquarters

298
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,269
- Hi, how's it going?
- Good.

299
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:11,096
We're doing a full-feature documentary.

300
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:15,626
It's on sustainability
and animal agriculture.

301
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,710
And we're here to talk
with David Barre.

302
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:21,004
- With Barre?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,668
- OK. Do you have an appointment with him?
- We've been trying for almost two months.

304
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:29,397
- We didn't even have one
receptive email, or anything.

305
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:32,723
- Sure.
- .. to see if we can set something up.

306
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,173
- Let me... So..
They sent out their PR person instead.

307
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:38,171
She refused to be filmed and
told us to turn off the camera,

308
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:40,840
but promised someone
from the rainforest, ocean

309
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,760
and climate change department who
would all speak with us. Finally.

310
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,998
Next stop was to give Sierra Club a visit.

311
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,497
Turns out they were a bit more receptive
to me showing up at their doorstep.

312
00:18:57,497 --> 00:18:58,999
How's it going?

313
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,157
<i>With climate change, what is
the leading cause of that?</i>

314
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,765
Well, it's basically burning
too many fossil fuels.

315
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:12,632
Coal, natural gas, oil, tar sands.

316
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:14,767
Oil shale…

317
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:18,364
All new fuel exotic fuels
that are kind of hybrids between them.

318
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:21,657
That's basically what is
loading up the atmosphere,

319
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:25,079
we have this greenhouse effect
where the heat is trapped

320
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,173
and the temperatures are soaring

321
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,198
at a rate that never existed
in the history of the Earth.

322
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,580
<i>What about ...</i>

323
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:36,890
<i>what about livestock
and animal agriculture?</i>

324
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,015
Well, what about it.. I mean...

325
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,281
<i>We ...</i>

326
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,081
<i>... did research</i>

327
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,375
<i>A couple of UN reports say animal
livestock accounts for more emissions</i>

328
00:19:49,703 --> 00:19:52,140
<i>than all transportation put together.</i>

329
00:19:52,506 --> 00:19:55,365
<i>A recent 2009 Worldwatch report:</i>

330
00:19:55,631 --> 00:20:00,081
<i>"Livestock causes 51%
of all greenhouse gas emissions…"</i>

331
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:01,849
Well...

332
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:06,732
It is a big issue and we need
to address that as well

333
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,673
but, you know, there are so many potential
sources of methane and carbon emissions…

334
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:18,771
<i>If the number one leading cause is animal
agriculture and meat consumption</i>

335
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:24,447
<i>then doesn't it mean to be the number one
focus, if not, the number two?</i>

336
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,090
Well, that's your assessment,
our assessment is different.

337
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:34,757
That was bizarre.

338
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,757
Greenpeace got back to
me today and said:

339
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:41,515
"It was great to meet with you yesterday."

340
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:45,780
"I've spoken with various people here at
Greenpeace about your request,

341
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:50,090
but I'm afraid we're not going to
be able to help this time."

342
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,126
"Thanks again, and best of luck."

343
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:57,449
Greenpeace's response
reminded me of the statistic

344
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,723
that 53.000 kilograms
of farm animal excrement

345
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,890
is produced every
second in the US alone.

346
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,995
That is enough waste per year to cover
every square foot of San Francisco,

347
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:11,701
New York City, Tokyo, Paris,

348
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:15,290
New Delhi, Berlin,
Hong Kong, London,

349
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:21,465
Rio de Janeiro, Delaware, Bali,
Costa Rica and Denmark combined.

350
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:30,651
Livestock operations on land has caused more
than 500 nitrogen-flooded dead zones

351
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:32,174
around the world and our oceans.

352
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:36,223
It comprises more than 245.000 km2
of areas completely devoid of life.

353
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,049
So any meaningful discussion
about the state of our oceans

354
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,548
has to always begin by frank discussions

355
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:47,974
about land-based animal agriculture,

356
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,600
which is not what our conservation
groups, Oceana being the largest one in the world,

357
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,399
and the most influential,

358
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,740
and others - at the apex of their discussions.

359
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,132
I went on my favourite oceans protection
organisation's website,

360
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:05,132
Surfrider Foundation, to see
what they were doing about this.

361
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:08,506
Mostly what I found were campaigns about
plastic bags and trash

362
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:10,830
but nothing about
animal agriculture.

363
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,520
<i>What is the number one
coastal water quality issue polluter?</i>

364
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,157
A lot of it...

365
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:22,698
We call it the "toxic cocktail."

366
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:26,417
Because it really is
this diffuse source.

367
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:31,074
It's heavy metal from tyres, brakes
and cars, heavy metals,

368
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,232
herbicides and pesticides.

369
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:38,140
Really picking up everything
we leave on the ground,

370
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,332
collecting it together and
pushing it out into the ocean.

371
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:43,807
It's hard to actually target one thing.

372
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:48,032
We're doing research on this
particular one, and run-off

373
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:52,281
and increasingly, as we're
interviewing more and more people,

374
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:56,177
what keeps coming up,
is animal agriculture

375
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:00,723
as being the number
one water polluter.

376
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,790
<i>Considerably far more
than any other…</i>

377
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:06,948
Yeah, interesting, I guess it depends
on the regions you focus on.

378
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:10,882
Like the urban areas, like where
we are in southern California where we are,

379
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:14,931
we don't see that, because there are
not a lot of agricultural farms

380
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,415
but look in the mid-Atlantic

381
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:20,340
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,

382
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:24,494
I know there are many poultry
farms, a lot of hog farms

383
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,590
and it's a huge waste issue.

384
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:30,107
I was surprised that they not only
not focus on farm run-off

385
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,340
they also didn't
mention in any campaigns

386
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,653
about how our oceans
are in near collapse.

387
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:37,723
The UN reporterd that the 3/4
of world's fisheries

388
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:41,777
are overexploited, fully
exploited or significantly depleted,

389
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:43,131
due to overfishing.

390
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:48,343
The oceans are under siege like never
before and marine environments are in trouble.

391
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,331
If we don't wake up and
do something about it

392
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:54,491
we have fishless oceans
by the year 2048.

393
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,315
That's the prediction
of scientists.

394
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:59,295
The fact that when people
look at fishing sometimes,

395
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:04,157
they look only at the animals
that are consumed by humans,

396
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:08,944
not necessarily looking at all the animals
who are caught in the drift nets

397
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:12,131
All the others animals
killed in the industry,

398
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:17,452
Even the shrimping industry has done
a lot to devastate the planet as well,

399
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,817
breaking down natural barriers
that we have to protect the islands.

400
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:27,863
We're at over 28 billion animals that
were pulled out of the oceans last year.

401
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:32,012
They are never given
a chance to recover.

402
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,257
They don't multiply that quickly,
we don't give them the opportunity.

403
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,189
The oceans are in complete collapse,

404
00:24:38,024 --> 00:24:40,773
the large fish specie
are near extinction.

405
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,277
The way fishing is done today, to feed the deman dfor  90 million tonnes of fish,

406
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:47,837
fishing is primarily done with massive fish nets.

407
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:49,913
For every pound
of fish caught,

408
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:53,930
up to 2,2 kg of untargeted
species become trapped,

409
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:59,222
such as dolphins, whales, sea turtles
and sharks, known as by-kill.

410
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:03,484
If we imagine the same happening
on the African savannah,

411
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:04,614
targeting the gazelle

412
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:09,613
but in the process scooping up every
single lion, giraffe, ostriche and elephant

413
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:11,286
nobody would stand for it.

414
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:16,506
Yet, this is what's happening
in our oceans every single day.

415
00:25:18,323 --> 00:25:21,003
Between 40-50 million sharks
are killed every year

416
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:23,428
in fishing lines
and fishing nets as by-kill.

417
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:26,223
Then their fins may b
cut off or not cut off

418
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,520
but they're caught
initially as by-kill.

419
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:34,770
And it's from fishing.
From fishing in a sustainable manner

420
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,380
in many cases for fish that are labelled
'sustainable', by for instance Oceana

421
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,883
and these sustainable
certified organisations.

422
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:48,647
So my thought is why would we stop
at banning shark fin soup

423
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,966
if you're concerned
about sharks?

424
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,301
Which these organisations
are, and most of the public is now.

425
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:57,359
If we're really concerned about
sharks, we would ban fishing.

426
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,540
I went on the world's largest
ocean conservation's groups website,

427
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,626
Oceana to see what
they do about this.

428
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,282
On their site, along the TED Talk
by CEO Andy Sharpless,

429
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:11,137
I was astounded to read they actually recommend
that one of the best ways to help fish

430
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,107
is to eat fish.

431
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:15,161
With the world's fish
population in near collapse,

432
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:18,432
this seems like saying that the best way
to help endangered pandas

433
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:19,315
is to eat pandas.

434
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:21,483
I couldn't understand how
Oceana could say

435
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,349
we could remove close to a
100 million tons of fish per year

436
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:28,957
and this could be sustainable
and good for our oceans.

437
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:34,425
In many species that
are near extinction,

438
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,422
have done so and

439
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:42,957
haven't recovered on
the watch of Oceana

440
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:45,773
and on the watch of Marine
Stewardship Council,

441
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,884
and on the watch of
Monterey Bay Sea Food.

442
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:53,823
I mentioned in one of my lectures
they are aptly named, because

443
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,098
they are watching this happen, instead
of aggressively halting it.

444
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:03,557
According to the UN Food and
Agricultural Organisation

445
00:27:06,365 --> 00:27:08,121
three-quarters of all the fisheries

446
00:27:08,121 --> 00:27:10,539
are either "fully exploited
or overexploited".

447
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,307
So there are not many
fish stocks out there

448
00:27:14,474 --> 00:27:19,260
that you might consider at healthy
levels for the ecosystem.

449
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,057
<i>Watching Andy's TED Talk
about feeding the world…</i>

450
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:28,681
<i>In 1988, the fishery peaked
at 85 million tonnes.</i>

451
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:34,315
<i>How can we sustainably catch
100 million tons in 2050?</i>

452
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:39,415
<i>Regardless if it's
in a farm or in an ocean, if</i>

453
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:41,748
<i>for every pound
of fish you take out</i>

454
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:45,382
<i>you essentially take out
2,2 kg of wild fish,</i>

455
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:49,990
<i>no matter whether it's a
pond or if it's in the ocean.</i>

456
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,723
<i>How can that be sustainable?</i>

457
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:04,822
The ultimate question is that there
is a tremendous amount of natural

458
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:09,781
production that comes out of
the oceans all the time.

459
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:14,996
We have a massive upwelling
from our ocean conveyor belt

460
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:18,731
that brings ancient nutrients

461
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,340
and our ecosystems
are turning that into fish.

462
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:26,322
Yes, they're eating each other and
you're losing some of that production

463
00:28:26,591 --> 00:28:29,715
every step up in the food chain,
but you get more every year.

464
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:34,331
You can fish, take some out and
next year there will be more.

465
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:38,931
And if we do that right, without
hitting the fundamental driver…

466
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:42,273
It's like living off the interest, right?

467
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,957
As long as you don't
bring the principle down

468
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:49,049
if you invest in something,

469
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:53,590
and the principle remains high,
you can live off the interest forever.

470
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:55,465
That's the basic
idea with fish.

471
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,427
<i>With our population right now…</i>

472
00:28:58,178 --> 00:29:03,115
<i>75% of the fish is depleted.</i>

473
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:06,307
<i>It's a good analogy with money,</i>

474
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:09,840
<i>We are not living off interest,
we are in extreme debt.</i>

475
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:14,098
<i>And if our population
is trying to live as a family</i>

476
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:17,590
<i>on the same amount of money</i>

477
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,340
<i>and it's increasing by 35 percent
to 9 billion people.</i>

478
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,957
<i>Isn't it just: "Hey, we have to
stop spending money"?</i>

479
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:26,440
- Yes.
<i>- "Let's not eat fish."</i>

480
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,657
If you can bring the principle back…

481
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:32,796
Fishing of any type is depleting
not only the species,

482
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,198
you get into this serial depletion,
where one fish species will be minimised

483
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:43,685
and the fishing industry for that fishery
will move on to the next species.

484
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:47,140
It's called serial
depletion, aptly named.

485
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:49,440
In the process fish is lost,

486
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:53,784
but the next in line is lost,

487
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:57,390
the mechanism is still
extremely destructive.

488
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:00,990
They lose the fish species,

489
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,423
but they also destroy habitats.

490
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:10,183
They came up with the term "sustainable fishing" to
make ourselves feel good about eating fish

491
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:13,441
and continue to take
fish from the oceans.

492
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,006
In fact, Sea Shepherd says

493
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:18,574
that there is no such thing
as "sustainable fishing".

494
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:29,180
Sea food is not a protein
source for the planet.

495
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:33,708
Nobody wants to hear it because it

496
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,862
makes them feel
they have to act.

497
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:38,544
Many people don't want to

498
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:42,806
disclose because it's uncomfortable
to tell others what to do.

499
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:45,574
But we are at a point where
we must all be rational,

500
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,181
and have to realise we
have to take action.

501
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,700
Our founder captain Watson says:

502
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,940
"If the oceans die, we die."
It's not a tagline, it's the truth.

503
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:59,474
Perhaps the only ecosystem that is
being destroyed at such a rapid rate

504
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,623
are the rainforests.

505
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,532
Our global rainforests are
the planet's lungs.

506
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:07,599
They absorb CO<s>2</s> and release oxygen.

507
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:11,265
4000 m<s>2</s> of rainforest
is cleared every second.

508
00:31:11,732 --> 00:31:16,373
To create pastures and
cultivate animal feed.

509
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,073
The equivalent of a football
field cleared every second.

510
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,390
It is estimated that every day

511
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:27,466
over 100 plant, animal and
insect species are lost

512
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:30,131
due to rainforest destruction.

513
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:44,082
Rainforest Action Network
Headquarters, San Francisco

514
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:49,076
What is the main cause of
rainforest destruction?

515
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,017
(Executive Director)
Human intervention,

516
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:56,208
either by logging
or agribusiness.

517
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:58,657
The top global drivers

518
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:01,973
varies somewhat depending
on the forest

519
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,923
but the way we use these
natural resources,

520
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,699
on an industrial scale
is the main cause.

521
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,178
When I went to the Rainforest
Action website

522
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:16,173
I couldn't believe there was
nothing about cattle.

523
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,931
But there was a big
campaign against palm oil.

524
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:23,997
Palm oil plantations cause tremendous
deforestation in the Indonesian rainforest.

525
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:26,582
It is estimated that palm
oil is responsible for

526
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:29,313
10 million hectares
of being cleared.

527
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,239
Though, livestock feed crops

528
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:37,757
are responsible for 56 million
hectares of lost rainforest today.

529
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,829
But I was shocked to find that
on their website cattle was not included

530
00:32:42,009 --> 00:32:43,781
as one of their
four main issues.

531
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:45,808
Instead, they
focused on palm,

532
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,530
pulp and paper, coal
and tar sands?

533
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:52,101
How can can they not have the
leading cause of rainforest destruction?

534
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,407
I had to wonder: why focus on fossil
fuels and not cattle?

535
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,743
<i>Is it more more fuel fossils
or is it more animal agriculture?</i>

536
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,610
I don't know why
we have to choose.

537
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:04,881
<i>I just want to know
which one is it?</i>

538
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,109
I don't necessarily
know what it is.

539
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:11,505
Could the executive director of
one of the largest rainforest

540
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:15,649
protection groups really
did not know what is happening?

541
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,299
Or even worse, hid something?
If so, why?

542
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,224
I immediately went to Amazon Watch
to see what they would say

543
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:25,632
what the leading cause of
rainforest destruction.

544
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:30,124
The most biologically and culturally
diverse place on the planet,

545
00:33:31,173 --> 00:33:33,028
is under massive attack right now.

546
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:38,346
The Amazon forest could
be gone in the next ten years.

547
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:41,881
<i>What is the leading cause
rainforest destruction?</i>

548
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:48,465
The main cause of
rainforest destruction…

549
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,682
Say ...

550
00:33:52,849 --> 00:33:56,071
To put Amazon Watch
in context ...

551
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,799
There are many drivers
of deforestation.

552
00:34:02,363 --> 00:34:07,060
Many reasons and ways
to destroy forests.

553
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:10,386
The main cause that
cause the most damage

554
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:14,611
are mega projects.

555
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:18,426
Such as oil and gas pipelines.
Mining projects,

556
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:22,366
such as mega dam projects.
We're not talking about ...

557
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:24,860
I felt like walking in circles
with all of these groups.

558
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,477
As if caught in some
"Cowspiracy" Twilight Zone

559
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,965
where nobody could
talk about cows.

560
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,590
I couldn't believe these
organisations just wouldn't say

561
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,715
what the leading cause of
rainforest destruction truly is.

562
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,995
I had to ask one more time.

563
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,975
It's hard to say what the leading
cause of deforestation in the Amazon

564
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:49,304
because they are all destructive: oil and gas,
mineral mining, dams, agriculture,

565
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:58,559
But in terms of land use, in terms of
the amount of land destroyed…

566
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,190
When we talk about in comparison
to all the causes of deforestation

567
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:11,006
what is causing the most
trees to fall, for example...

568
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,910
It think it would
definitely be agriculture.

569
00:35:16,705 --> 00:35:21,792
Unfortunately, one of the biggest
causes of deforestation

570
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,930
definitely in the Brazilian Amazon,
is agribusiness.

571
00:35:26,246 --> 00:35:30,549
Cattle grazing and soy
production in particular.

572
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,982
<i>This is what really is going on.</i>

573
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:35,006
<i>Why do you think ...</i>

574
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:40,831
<i>Nobody, like Greenpeace, will</i>

575
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:44,132
<i>say the whole story?</i>

576
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:45,173
Yes.

577
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:49,840
I think you raised
very good points,

578
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,205
why is anyone doing
anything about it.

579
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,690
I think in Brazil, especially
when we look at

580
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,590
what happened after
Forest law was passed

581
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:06,262
people stood up against the
lobbyists and private interests:

582
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,610
the cattle industry,
agribusiness…

583
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,262
what happened to them, many of
those who spoke out were killed.

584
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:15,883
If you look at Ze Carlos, Claudio

585
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:18,969
People who put
themselves out there

586
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:23,785
and said cattle ranching
destroys the Amazon

587
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,918
a lot of people who
put themselves out there

588
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,356
like Dorothy Stang, a nun
who lived in Para

589
00:36:31,994 --> 00:36:33,757
... was killed.

590
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,798
Many people will speak up,
many people stay silent

591
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:43,840
because they don't want to be the next
to end up with a bullet to their head.

592
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:47,250
Sister Dorothy Stang
was an American nun

593
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:50,174
who lived in the heart of the
Brazilian rainforest.

594
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,757
She dedicated her life
to protect the Amazon.

595
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:55,757
She spoke out openly against
the destruction of the rainforest

596
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,498
and cattle ranching for years.

597
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:02,364
Walking home one night she was
brutally gunned down at point blank range

598
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:05,157
by a hired gun of
the cattle industry.

599
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,531
After Greenpeace initial denial
for the interview

600
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:28,454
I wrote again, begging
they reconsider.

601
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:32,440
Greenpeace got back again
and said again:

602
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:36,265
"I'm afraid we explored the
options in terms of helping you

603
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:40,707
and are not going to be able
to help this time."

604
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:43,615
You mentioned you would
also speak with Oceana,

605
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:46,598
I'm sure they will be
able to give you some great quotes

606
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,199
about the ocean-related issues.

607
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,615
Thanks again for thinking of us."

608
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:53,723
Unbelievable.

609
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,993
With Greenpeace
unwilling to be interviewed

610
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,274
I had to find a different
avenue to get answers.

611
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,974
There's something
really fishy going on over there.

612
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,639
Fortunately, I found a former Greenpeace
board of director

613
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,774
who now speaks openly
about the industry.

614
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:12,040
Environmental organisations like other
organisations are not telling you the truth

615
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,651
about what the world needs
from us as a species.

616
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:20,676
It's so frustrating when the information
is right before their eyes.

617
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:24,823
It's documented in peer-reviewed journals,

618
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,874
it's there for everybody to see,

619
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,615
but the environmental organisations
are refusing to act.

620
00:38:31,982 --> 00:38:33,515
Nowhere you find in the policies

621
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:36,740
or Greenpeace mission,

622
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,074
that diet is important.

623
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,323
That animal agriculture
is the problem.

624
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,406
They refuse, like other
environmental organisations,

625
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,106
to look at the issue.

626
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:53,848
The environmental community is failing
us and they're failing the ecosystems.

627
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:58,990
It's so frustrating to
see them do this.

628
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,531
"NRDC, the Earth's best defense"

629
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:12,565
Alright, they actually do have a
few things on animal agriculture.

630
00:39:17,073 --> 00:39:22,831
The leading cause of environmental
degradation is too much pollution.

631
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:22,865
Too many engines churning too fast
The main cause of environmental
degradation is too much pollution.

632
00:39:22,865 --> 00:39:27,815
Too many engines churning too fast

633
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,765
in too many places
around the globe.

634
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,731
<i>In late 2009, a Worldwatch report:</i>

635
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:37,845
<i>livestock causes 51%
of greenhouse gas emissions</i>

636
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:40,207
<i>and transportation is about 13%.</i>

637
00:39:40,207 --> 00:39:44,149
<i>On the low end there's the
UN between 18 and 30%,</i>

638
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:48,199
<i>which is more than all
transportation together.</i>

639
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,323
Nationally ... or internationally?

640
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,190
- Or nationally?
<i>- Worldwide, yes.</i>

641
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:58,648
I think energy production
and transportation

642
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,515
are still the major
sources so I think ...

643
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:08,465
I'm guess I'm not going to comment on that,
because I'm not familiar with those numbers.

644
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:11,240
So don't quote me on this,
but that's cow farts.

645
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,723
I think what that is.

646
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,857
I think that's cow fart.

647
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,764
Well, that's part
of the story.

648
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,989
Methane production from cows
and other livestock flatulence

649
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:29,526
is a major contributor.

650
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,733
But mostly it is due to deforestation
and the waste they produce.

651
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:37,548
Which exceeds 130 times more than
the waste of all humans.

652
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:41,315
Almost all without the benefit
any waste treatment.

653
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:46,870
The NRDC absolutely has
a big food programme.

654
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,582
In fact, every year, we
do the "Going Green Awards"

655
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:52,984
and we recognise
food innovators.

656
00:40:54,004 --> 00:41:00,331
Last year, one of the awardees was
a sustainable pork producer

657
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:04,148
that doesn't use antibiotics.

658
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:10,232
The antibiotic use that
industrial food production

659
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:13,557
in the US uses…

660
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:18,357
We're getting the majority
of antibiotics in the US

661
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:22,032
are administered to healthy livestock.

662
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,473
I wanted to visit one of
these sustainable farms.

663
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,207
I found the Markegard beef farm

664
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:34,107
on the lush misty
California coast.

665
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:46,857
I met Erik and Doniga Markegard
and their four children.

666
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:52,851
Lea and Larry are usually
up and out at 6 milking,

667
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:54,652
feeding the pigs...

668
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:09,295
Altogether, we graze 1800 hectares

669
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:12,065
and this is our home ranch,

670
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:16,982
and this is 380 hectares.

671
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:24,540
On average it's one cow or a cow and
a calf for every four hectares.

672
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:37,236
Annually we produce almost
36,000 kg plate-ready meat.

673
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:48,740
We keep about 10 pigs
in a 20 hectare area.

674
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:52,648
and move them in
4 acre pastures.

675
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:58,409
(Daughter)
Some say pigs are dirty and
gross, but I like them.

676
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:06,357
They know people and they will
be friends and real nice.

677
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:11,799
They could be your best
friend or like a sister.

678
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,715
See.

679
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:17,549
They know you and we
get to know them.

680
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:21,248
I shouldn't be bonding
but we have to have nice pigs.

681
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,048
Why shouldn't you bond with them?

682
00:43:23,048 --> 00:43:25,823
Because they will turn into bacon.

683
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:32,065
These pigs are 7 months old now.

684
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,490
These bigger ones are getting ready to be killed.

685
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:40,507
The two smaller ones can
grow for a few more months.

686
00:43:41,507 --> 00:43:47,166
I love, I love animals and that's
why I'm in the meat business.

687
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:51,196
What society needs
to see more

688
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:56,549
is that that packaged piece
of meat is a living animal

689
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:02,257
living, breathing creature.

690
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:06,990
Yes, it's hard, it's hard,
but what Doniga said earlier,

691
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:10,140
we do it because
we love them.

692
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:13,006
<i>With the land use</i>

693
00:44:13,173 --> 00:44:19,965
<i>that is between 1 to 1,5 hectare per cow ...</i>

694
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:25,231
<i>all the way up to, depending on, not as
lush as this, up to 14 acres.</i>

695
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:27,865
Yes, we have a ranch in
South Dakota that is

696
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:31,590
20 hectares ...
Yes, it's 20 ha, yes.

697
00:44:31,857 --> 00:44:33,757
<i>Why is that?</i>

698
00:44:34,023 --> 00:44:37,090
The same thing, it was farmed
and robbed of the nitrogens.

699
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,661
- Abused the land…
- It's also seasonal, right?

700
00:44:39,662 --> 00:44:41,307
It's also seasonal.

701
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:46,799
<i>Is it possible and practical
for the whole world to say:</i>

702
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:49,048
<i>"Grow grass-fed cattle"?</i>

703
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:50,865
<i>Like say in Brazil, where</i>

704
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:57,432
<i>80% of the rainforest
was destroyed for cattle.</i>

705
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:00,140
<i>What are your thoughts on that?</i>

706
00:45:00,507 --> 00:45:03,998
They shouldn't eat beef.

707
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:09,250
If their environment wasn't
designed to raise beef

708
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:11,444
- they shouldn't be eating it.
- Yeah.

709
00:45:11,465 --> 00:45:15,215
<i>How do you offset the carbon
footprint of livestock?</i>

710
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,923
We don't feel that livestock
have a carbon footprint.

711
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:26,715
I left feeling confused.

712
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:29,774
As far as grass-fed beef
not having a carbon footprint

713
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,945
sounded like it could make sense.

714
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,915
Until I added up the numbers
on land use and population.

715
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:37,444
If we use the Markegard model
for raising animals

716
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:40,674
which requires about 1800 ha
to produce 36,300 kg of meat.

717
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:43,549
The average American eats
95 kg of meat per year.

718
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:44,990
If that was all grass-fed beef

719
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:47,670
only 382 people could
be fed on the land.

720
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:53,131
That's 5 ha per person, times
314 million Americans,

721
00:45:53,298 --> 00:45:56,474
which equals 1,3 billion ha
grazing land.

722
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,457
Unfortunately, there are only
809 million ha in 48 US lower states.

723
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:06,632
Currently, nearly half of US land is
already dedicated to animal agriculture.

724
00:46:06,899 --> 00:46:08,532
If we switch to grass-fed beef

725
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,715
it would require every
cm2 in the US.

726
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:15,999
Up to Canada, all of Central America
and well into South America.

727
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:19,040
And this is just to feed
US demand on meat.

728
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:22,023
But that figure does not even
take into consideration

729
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,750
that much of the land is
not suited for livestock.

730
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:28,273
We would have to convert all
mountain ranges to grass lands.

731
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,640
Clear ancient forests and
national parks for grazing.

732
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,690
And demolish every city
to make room to graze cows.

733
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:40,031
Just like Brazil, the US is not
suited to meet demands for meat.

734
00:46:40,232 --> 00:46:43,280
It takes 23 months for a
grass-fed animal to

735
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:46,347
grow and reach
slaughter age.

736
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:49,535
A grain-fed cow takes 15 months.

737
00:46:49,571 --> 00:46:55,215
That's an additional eight months of
water use, land use, feed, waste.

738
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:58,857
In terms of the carbon foot print,
it's a huge difference.

739
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:00,532
Turns out, due
to land use

740
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:05,940
grass-fed beef is more unsustainable
than even factory farming.

741
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,695
I had to come to terms
with the fact that there are not

742
00:47:09,732 --> 00:47:12,607
enough animals for the
world's demand for meat

743
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:14,565
and had my doubts
on dairy as well.

744
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:17,732
But I wanted to talk with
a premier organic dairy company.

745
00:47:17,732 --> 00:47:21,407
to see if their product was sustainable
for the world's population.

746
00:47:21,674 --> 00:47:24,872
It requires a lot of inputs.

747
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:28,808
Feed, water, land.

748
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:34,200
It may not be practical to expect that there can

749
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,106
be enough dairy produced
sustainably to feed the entire world.

750
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,962
I think that's not necessarily a given.

751
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:46,078
I think maybe it's
too much to expect

752
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:52,064
that the world can be fed
with sustainable dairy.

753
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:55,282
I don't know the answer,
but common sense would say,

754
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,649
that's a long shot.

755
00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:00,482
I was shocked to hear
such an honest answer.

756
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:05,165
If this is what the dairy CEO would say,
what would the farmer claim?

757
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:08,849
Based on their marketing
their farms are an oasis for cows.

758
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:11,490
FOR GOODNESS SAKE
Drink Clover Milk

759
00:48:14,498 --> 00:48:17,200
It was not what I expected.

760
00:48:28,598 --> 00:48:33,514
Normally a cow consumes
64-70 kg of feed a day.

761
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:37,415
- Between 64 ...
- Between 64 and 70 kg a day.

762
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,974
She also drinks between
114-151 litres of water.

763
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,473
My God.

764
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,715
We use about 20 tons per week.

765
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:50,473
- 20 tonnes of grain per week.
- 20 tonnes.

766
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,515
Primarily for milking cows,
so about 250 cows.

767
00:48:56,348 --> 00:48:58,974
The biggest part of
sustainability, to me,

768
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,890
the number one thing on
the list should be profitability

769
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:07,215
How the process completely
works from start to finish:

770
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:09,890
The cow needs to have a
baby in order to give milk.

771
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:14,665
So she have the baby, the baby is going to
stay with the mother for at least two days.

772
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,890
The babies will go off to a
calve-raising facility.

773
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,665
They are raised in
an individual hutch.

774
00:49:20,932 --> 00:49:24,598
Since we are a dairy, only the
girl cows give us milk, so the boys

775
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:28,807
on typical dairies are sold
off to beef-raising facilities.

776
00:49:28,974 --> 00:49:31,899
But we keep half of
them for two years

777
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:34,482
and sell them as organic
grass-fed beef.

778
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:38,331
So all dairy cows eventually
go to the beef industry?

779
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:42,074
At some point in time
she will drop off

780
00:49:42,074 --> 00:49:44,540
and you have to
make a business decision.

781
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,148
Do you keep investing in
her to give milk

782
00:49:47,515 --> 00:49:51,932
or sell her off to another dairy
or to the beef industry.

783
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:05,774
Only a few places on the planet
have this type of environment.

784
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,857
But the demand for dairy-based
protein will increase in the world.

785
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:11,942
There is not enough
land on the planet

786
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,257
for this type of dairying.

787
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:20,099
The land is not there.

788
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:27,099
On a global scale the conclusion
would be it's not sustainable

789
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,807
Unless we dig up houses
and put pastures back.

790
00:50:32,431 --> 00:50:36,457
For this to happen, there
have to be less people.

791
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:41,598
But we know the population
continues to grow.

792
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:44,899
That means more commercial
dairy, I'm sure.

793
00:50:45,265 --> 00:50:47,440
That or lower the demand ...

794
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:50,140
Yes, or another
product will take its place.

795
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:53,849
We see all sorts of soy
and almond milks

796
00:50:54,015 --> 00:50:56,348
other products and different blends.

797
00:50:56,515 --> 00:51:00,557
Juices and proteins.

798
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,458
I think we'll see more of that.

799
00:51:02,682 --> 00:51:05,925
He was right. How could
cow's milk be sustainable?

800
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:11,099
1 litre of milk it takes a 1000 litres of water to produce.

801
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:13,565
Doing research on
grass-fed livestock

802
00:51:13,565 --> 00:51:16,099
I kept coming across
the work of Allan Savory.

803
00:51:16,265 --> 00:51:19,406
Almost a third of the planet
is becoming desert,

804
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:22,306
with the vast majority
due to livestock grazing.

805
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:26,023
Savory claims that the best
way to reverse this desertification

806
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,907
is to actually graze more animals.

807
00:51:28,974 --> 00:51:30,773
This reminded me of Oceana saying

808
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:33,181
that the best way to
help fish is to eat fish.

809
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:34,390
This is the same man

810
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:37,057
who in the 1950s, working
as a research officer

811
00:51:37,223 --> 00:51:39,807
for the Game Department
of what is now Zimbabwe,

812
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:42,807
came up with the theory, in spite
of scientific evidence

813
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,446
that elephants caused
the desertification.

814
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:51,306
His solution was to convince the
government to kill 40,000 elephants.

815
00:51:55,807 --> 00:52:02,965
Yet, after 14 years of relentless
slaughter the conditions got worse.

816
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:05,974
His theory was wrong.

817
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,140
The culling finally ended,

818
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:12,465
but not before tens of thousands of
elephants and their families were killed.

819
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:17,223
This is not someone I would
ever take ecological advice from.

820
00:52:27,057 --> 00:52:30,199
It turns out the cattle
industry has the same effect

821
00:52:30,465 --> 00:52:33,132
on wild life in the US.

822
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,657
The government is rounding
up horses in mass.

823
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:39,640
We have now more wild horses
and donkeys in state farms.

824
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:44,515
50.000 horses and burros more
than free on the range.

825
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:48,448
Basically, rangers get to
graze on our public lands

826
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:50,573
for a a fraction of
the going rate.

827
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,823
They enjoy tax subsidies,
about 1/15 of the going rate.

828
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,199
What the Bureau's Land Management
has to do is say:

829
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,465
"How much forage and
water is on the land?"

830
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:00,540
Then they divide,

831
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:03,682
a part for the cows,
other to "wildlife".

832
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,890
and to wild horses and burros.

833
00:53:06,157 --> 00:53:09,865
What we see is that
most forage and water

834
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:11,865
goes to the livestock industry.

835
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,898
They scapegoat the horses
and burros and say:

836
00:53:14,898 --> 00:53:17,782
"There are too many horses
and burros, let's remove them."

837
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:22,157
I always tell people that the wild horses
and donkeys are just victims

838
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,774
of the management of public
lands for livestock

839
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,065
because we also see
the predator killing going on.

840
00:53:28,065 --> 00:53:32,240
We now know wolves
are targeted by ranchers.

841
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:36,982
The Department of Agriculture has air-craft
and do aerial gunning of predators.

842
00:53:36,982 --> 00:53:39,615
All a rancher needs to say:
"I've got a coyote here."

843
00:53:39,982 --> 00:53:41,782
They come over and shoot the coyote.

844
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:44,365
Or shoot the mountain
lion or shoot the bobcat.

845
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,115
And this is all for ranching.

846
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:52,106
In Washington State, after
cattle was attacked

847
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:55,143
on public lands where it was grazing

848
00:53:56,074 --> 00:54:02,531
Washington state decided to
kill an entire pack of wolves.

849
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:07,448
Those wolves were not introduced,
they had immigrated from Canada.

850
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,448
But they're no longer there.

851
00:54:09,715 --> 00:54:13,283
It starts at the local level, with
the Bureau of Land Management

852
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,440
but then it goes to Congress.

853
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:19,112
And we see that Congress allows

854
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:22,036
this type of mismanagement
of public land to continue.

855
00:54:22,036 --> 00:54:28,779
It is the insistence and lobbying power
of the agriculture industry

856
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:32,949
that continues to see wolves killed.

857
00:54:33,115 --> 00:54:36,667
and insists on predators being maintained at

858
00:54:36,737 --> 00:54:41,199
a low level that does not
benefit the ecosystems.

859
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:45,360
I've seen so many pieces of land, so many
environmental assessments

860
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:48,932
from the Bureau of Land
Management that say

861
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:50,840
the range land does
not meet the standards.

862
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,650
They say straight up
livestock-raising is a cause

863
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,265
for not meeting range standards.

864
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,566
Yet they allow livestock grazing.

865
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:05,706
They are at the core of making sure that
cougars are hunted by hounds,

866
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,306
that wolf packs
are run down,

867
00:55:08,573 --> 00:55:12,957
that hunting seasons
are opened up year-round,

868
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:15,984
that traps are set
so that they suffer.

869
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,144
If anyone cares for horses,
wildlife and public land

870
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:23,149
and the environment, you
can't ignore livestock,

871
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:27,261
the negative impact of livestock
grazing on public lands in the West.

872
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:32,267
I added up the cost of
animal food production

873
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,581
that producers don't
bear themselves.

874
00:55:35,648 --> 00:55:38,082
The hidden or externalised costs

875
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:39,907
that they impose on society.

876
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:44,032
Those are categories like
health care, environmental damage,

877
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:47,915
subsidies, damage to
fisheries and even cruelty.

878
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:53,032
Those external costs are
about 332 billion euros.

879
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:58,455
If the dairy and meat industry
would internalise these costs,

880
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,703
if they had to bear the costs themselves,

881
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:05,525
the price of meat and
dairy would skyrocket.

882
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:09,786
A 5 euro carton of eggs
would go to 10 euros.

883
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:12,330
A 3,50 euro Big Mac
would go to 9 euros.

884
00:56:13,218 --> 00:56:16,974
The problem with these external
costs imposed on society

885
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,565
is whether you
eat meat or not

886
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:21,929
whether you're an
omnivore or an herbivore

887
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:26,594
you pay part of the costs of
someone else's consumption.

888
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:28,306
When someone goes
to McDonald's

889
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:30,693
and buys a 3,50 euro Big Mac.

890
00:56:30,706 --> 00:56:34,160
there's another 6,35 euro of
costs are imposed on society.

891
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,365
I'm paying that paying that, you're
paying that whether you eat meat or not.

892
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:42,515
When we look at who benefits and
lobbies for this system of agriculture

893
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:46,546
it's the largest food and meat

894
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,685
producers in the country.

895
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:52,117
And once they become so large
and wealthy they

896
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:57,147
can dictate federal policies
around producing food.

897
00:56:57,681 --> 00:57:01,336
because they have so
much political power.

898
00:57:01,715 --> 00:57:04,212
Was this why Al Gore,
even as vice-president,

899
00:57:04,594 --> 00:57:06,573
never addressed the question
of animal agriculture

900
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:09,240
and failed to mention it his film
"An Inconvenient Truth"

901
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:12,141
or in his organisation the
Climate Reality Project?

902
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:15,418
Was this truth just too
inconvenient, for even him?

903
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:19,624
I felt let down by the man who
inspired me in on this path.

904
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,340
I had to speak with an
animal agriculture lobbyist

905
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,374
to see what they would say.

906
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,274
If they can silence
the government, can they

907
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,657
influence environmental
groups as well?

908
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:35,365
Agriculture Animal Alliance, one of
biggest animal agriculture lobby groups

909
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:38,898
agreed to an interview.
Greenpeace won't give us an interview

910
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:42,190
but Animal Agriculture Alliance
has agreed to an interview.

911
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:44,232
Now that...

912
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:46,417
That is saying something.

913
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:50,340
People hear the word GMOs
and it's a scary term.

914
00:57:50,611 --> 00:57:54,486
and agriculture struggles
to explain what that means.

915
00:57:54,563 --> 00:58:00,606
In reality we use
technology to make advancements

916
00:58:01,922 --> 00:58:03,988
in how we grow
and raise animals.

917
00:58:03,988 --> 00:58:07,860
We're not going to feed the world
on how it was 100 years ago

918
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:10,273
where all animals
were pasture-fed.

919
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:14,523
We not just move animals
inside and implemented

920
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,781
large vertically integrated systems.
Because of sustainability

921
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:21,015
it certainly reduces the
environmental impact,

922
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,305
while improving animal
welfare and food safety.

923
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:28,374
<i>So that animals like it
inside just as much as</i>

924
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,427
<i>say the chickens and cows,
fond of being inside</i>

925
00:58:31,446 --> 00:58:33,323
<i>they like the ones pasture-fed?</i>

926
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:37,631
In many cases it
improved their wellbeing,

927
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:41,531
in terms of the care
they can get, individually.

928
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:43,923
<i>Does the meat and dairy
industry ever support</i>

929
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:47,023
<i>or donate to environmental non-profits?</i>

930
00:58:47,621 --> 00:58:49,969
I don't know if I want
to comment on that.

931
00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:52,238
(Voice of the President Kay Smith
Animal Agriculture Alliance)
<i>Yeah, I…</i>

932
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,023
I don't know.

933
00:58:54,982 --> 00:59:00,826
(Voice of the President Kay Smith
Animal Agriculture Alliance)
[?]<i> They don't need to know who
we donate to or not donate to.</i>

934
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:05,690
<i>Does the meat and dairy industry ever
support or donate to Greenpeace?</i>

935
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,773
Again, I don't know if
I feel comfortable ...

936
00:59:12,565 --> 00:59:14,876
Hi, sorry we didn't contact earlier.

937
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,384
I have some bad news.

938
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:20,399
(call from film backer)
Unfortunately, we are not longer able to
continue to fund your film project.

939
00:59:20,399 --> 00:59:23,898
<i>We had a meeting and due to the
growing controversial subject matter</i>

940
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,883
<i>we have some concerns
and have to pull out.</i>

941
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:29,357
Why was this subject
so controversial?

942
00:59:29,423 --> 00:59:32,648
The first person I could think
to speak with, was Howard Lyman

943
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:35,443
who was sued by cattlemen
for speaking the truth about

944
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:39,198
animal agriculture on
The Oprah Winfrey Show.

945
00:59:41,282 --> 00:59:46,449
I was born on the largest
dairy farm of Montana in 1938.

946
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:54,010
Grew up and lived on
a livestock farm.

947
00:59:54,115 --> 00:59:58,315
I graduated on Agriculture at
Montana State University.

948
00:59:58,781 --> 01:00:06,842
Came back and developed a mega
venture in agriculture

949
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,781
with 4046 ha in crops,

950
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,781
7000 head of cattle

951
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:15,823
and about 30 employees.

952
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:20,540
I spent 45 years of my life
in animal agriculture.

953
01:00:22,634 --> 01:00:24,690
I've been there, done that.

954
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:28,695
When I was on the Oprah show we
had the Food-Disparagement Law

955
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:34,014
In my opinion the law
was unconstitutional.

956
01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:37,720
What it basically
said, it was illegal

957
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:43,657
to state something that was known to
be false about a perishable product.

958
01:00:43,823 --> 01:00:47,282
I didn't say anything on the
show that I thought was false.

959
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:49,948
I went there and told the truth.

960
01:00:50,215 --> 01:00:55,499
It took five years and
hundreds of thousands of dollars

961
01:00:55,865 --> 01:01:03,330
to get rid of the suits
from the cattle industry.

962
01:01:03,906 --> 01:01:08,657
But if was to go on
the Oprah Show today

963
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:13,540
I'd say exactly the same thing
I said back then,

964
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:15,823
I would be guilty.

965
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:21,328
For me, when they were talking
about the Food-Disparagement Law

966
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:25,806
was about whether I
told the truth or not.

967
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:30,149
You can go today and tell the truth

968
01:01:30,715 --> 01:01:32,831
and you will be guilty.

969
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,640
Because if you
cause a disruption

970
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:41,007
in the profits of
the animal industry,

971
01:01:41,774 --> 01:01:44,690
you're guilty under the Patriot Act.

972
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:50,323
<i>Do you think there should be any concerns of
us making this documentary?</i>

973
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:51,906
Of course!

974
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,323
If you don't realise

975
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:57,881
that you're putting your neck
on the chopping block,

976
01:01:59,468 --> 01:02:02,849
you better take that
camera and throw it away.

977
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:09,357
The animal and agriculture industry is one
of the most powerful on the planet.

978
01:02:09,357 --> 01:02:12,423
I think most people in this
country are aware of the influence

979
01:02:12,423 --> 01:02:16,965
of the money and industry on
politics, and we see it clearly

980
01:02:17,257 --> 01:02:19,077
with this industry in particular.

981
01:02:19,077 --> 01:02:20,178
Most people would be shocked

982
01:02:20,178 --> 01:02:22,524
to learn that animal rights
and environmental activists

983
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:26,223
are the number one domestic terrorism
threat according to the FBI.

984
01:02:26,223 --> 01:02:28,826
<i>- Why is that?</i>
- Difficult to answer

985
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:32,623
why the these groups are on the
top of the FBI's priorities.

986
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,036
I think a big part of it is that

987
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:37,940
that they more than any
other social movement,

988
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,006
directly threaten
corporate profits.

989
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:43,496
When we try to find out
how factory farms,

990
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:46,355
how animal agriculture is
pulling the environment,

991
01:02:46,355 --> 01:02:48,540
they try to claim exemptions
to that information

992
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,623
either under national security
terms or public safety,

993
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:55,834
trade mark issues, it's a business secret.

994
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:57,950
We've seen all these attempts to
keep people in the dark

995
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,787
about what they're actually doing.

996
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:02,057
One of the biggest
industries on the planet

997
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:04,278
with the biggest
environmental impact,

998
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:06,465
trying to keep us in the
dark on how it's operating.

999
01:03:06,465 --> 01:03:09,062
Through the Freedom of Information
Act we got documents from

1000
01:03:09,062 --> 01:03:10,230
the antiterrorism unit,

1001
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:13,449
that show they
monitor my lectures,

1002
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:16,957
media interviews like this
one, my website, my book...

1003
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:19,964
<i>Are we at risk filming
and showing this?</i>

1004
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:23,323
You're going up against people that
have massive legal resources.

1005
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,946
The amount of money at
their disposal is overwhelming

1006
01:03:27,455 --> 01:03:28,500
And you have nothing.

1007
01:03:28,528 --> 01:03:31,650
I think that fear is
a big part of the tactic as well.

1008
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,640
Will was right, I was scared.

1009
01:03:35,206 --> 01:03:37,235
When I learned about
activists killed in Brazil

1010
01:03:37,235 --> 01:03:39,590
I was disturbed,
but it was far away.

1011
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,194
But learn about American
activists and journalists

1012
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:44,940
being targets of the animal
agriculture industry and the FBI?

1013
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,665
My funding being dropped?

1014
01:03:46,732 --> 01:03:49,607
I was genuinely worried when
it hit me directly.

1015
01:03:49,774 --> 01:03:52,740
Was this why noone was willing
to talk about the issue?

1016
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:57,190
I decided to take precautionary measures
with all the footage we shot.

1017
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,357
I was beyond frightened to
imagine what could possibly happen

1018
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:11,040
if I would pursue
this project any further?

1019
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:16,774
It seemed the only decision to make was to
put down the cameras and walk away.

1020
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:21,450
Then I realised that
this issue was way bigger

1021
01:04:21,685 --> 01:04:24,674
than any personal concern
I could ever have for myself.

1022
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,607
This was about all life on earth hanging
in the balance of our actions.

1023
01:04:28,774 --> 01:04:31,857
Either you live for
something or die for nothing.

1024
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:34,482
I actually had no choice all along.

1025
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:37,557
I decided then to surrender not
to fear from a secret

1026
01:04:37,557 --> 01:04:39,690
but rather to a cause to its truth.

1027
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:41,894
I couldn't be like the
environmental NGOs,

1028
01:04:41,894 --> 01:04:46,173
when the planet was being
eaten alive in front of our eyes.

1029
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,523
I had to stand
up and continue on.

1030
01:04:56,523 --> 01:04:59,390
Some people would say the problem
isn't really animal agriculture

1031
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:02,315
but human over-population.

1032
01:05:04,565 --> 01:05:07,398
In 1812 there were 1 billion
people on the planet.

1033
01:05:07,565 --> 01:05:10,048
In 1912, 1,5 billion.

1034
01:05:10,315 --> 01:05:16,009
Just 100 years later, our
population exploded to 7 billion.

1035
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:18,507
This number gets much attention

1036
01:05:18,774 --> 01:05:22,148
but a more important figure

1037
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:27,815
are the 70 billion farm
animals humans raise.

1038
01:05:28,123 --> 01:05:32,440
The human population drinks 20
billion litres of water per day

1039
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:35,240
and eats 4,3 billion
kilos of food.

1040
01:05:35,607 --> 01:05:38,106
But the 1,5 billion
cows in the world,

1041
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:41,472
drink 170 billion litres
of water per day.

1042
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:44,915
and eat 60 billion
pounds of food.

1043
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:47,115
This less of a human
population issue

1044
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:50,515
but more a "human eating animals"
population issue.

1045
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:53,092
Environmental organisations
not addressing this

1046
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:56,031
is like health organisations
fighting lung cancer and

1047
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:58,040
not speaking about
cigarette smoking.

1048
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:00,981
But instead of passive smoking,
it's second-hand eating

1049
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:02,940
which affects the entire planet.

1050
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:08,663
(Environmental and Ethics Author)
We grow enough food to feed
between 12 and 15 billion people.

1051
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,257
We have 7 billion people.

1052
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:14,840
We have roughly a billion people
starving every day.

1053
01:06:15,206 --> 01:06:19,226
Worldwide, 50% of the grain and
legumes we're growing,

1054
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:20,874
are to feed the animals.

1055
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:23,173
They're eating huge
amounts of grain and legumes.

1056
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:28,164
In the US it's close to 70-80%,
depending on the grain

1057
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:30,315
90% ... 90% of the soya beans.

1058
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:34,836
82% of the world's starving
children live

1059
01:06:34,997 --> 01:06:38,698
in countries where food is fed
to animals in the livestock systems

1060
01:06:38,698 --> 01:06:41,515
and are killed and eaten
by more well-off individuals

1061
01:06:41,515 --> 01:06:44,165
in developed countries,
such as US, UK and Europe,

1062
01:06:44,165 --> 01:06:49,290
The fact is today we could feed
every human being on the planet today

1063
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,323
with an adequate diet,

1064
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:56,965
if we take the feed
we're feeding to animals

1065
01:06:57,431 --> 01:07:00,290
and turn it into food for humans.

1066
01:07:00,657 --> 01:07:04,707
Someone trying to justify GMOs

1067
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:08,690
is like trying to give a
drowning man a drink of water.

1068
01:07:09,057 --> 01:07:13,590
You can produce on average,
15 times more protein

1069
01:07:14,057 --> 01:07:21,119
from plant-based sources
than from meat on any given area of land.

1070
01:07:21,354 --> 01:07:23,874
Whether it's a very fertile area

1071
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,707
or on a depleted area.

1072
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:29,415
If we would reduce the amount of
meat we're eating, dairy and eggs.

1073
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:31,899
we could allow all those mono-crop fields

1074
01:07:32,165 --> 01:07:34,682
with genetically engineered
corn and soya beans

1075
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:38,065
to revert back to forest again
to be habitat for animals.

1076
01:07:38,531 --> 01:07:44,140
Anytime someone tells you "we
can't grow food for humans on

1077
01:07:44,406 --> 01:07:48,074
land that we're growing
feed for animals,"

1078
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:52,641
this is somebody that is moking the number one crop out of California.

1079
01:07:53,913 --> 01:07:58,849
The fact of is, if you can grow
grow corn to stuff down on an animal,

1080
01:07:59,115 --> 01:08:02,390
we can grow corn
and feed it to a human.

1081
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,240
You encourage people to eat
less meat, for the tremendous resources required

1082
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,032
and the toll on the environment.

1083
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:11,065
- And on the animals.
- And on the animals.

1084
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:14,281
And the workers in the system. It's
a brutal system at every level.

1085
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:18,974
As the world population
grows to 9 billion

1086
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:23,993
do you foresee that one day we will have
to stop eating meat altogether?

1087
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,129
I don't know if we
will completely stop.

1088
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,907
I think the amount of meat
eating will decline.

1089
01:08:29,907 --> 01:08:32,800
There is no way to support
255 gr meat per person per day,

1090
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,957
what Americans are eating now.

1091
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:37,723
If the Chinese alone decide to
eat that much,

1092
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:40,199
and they decided they want
eat the same amount.

1093
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,199
We don't have enough world

1094
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:46,135
to produce the grain to
generate that much meat.

1095
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:50,949
I think a plant-based diet
is the most sustainable.

1096
01:08:51,115 --> 01:08:54,652
What do you recommend the
9 billion people to eat,

1097
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:57,115
not only to sustain,
but also to thrive?

1098
01:08:57,115 --> 01:08:59,615
Would you throw a number ...
Like 30 grams?

1099
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:02,805
- For meat?
- Including dairy.

1100
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:05,823
I don't know enough.

1101
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:09,856
It would be at the order of
a couple of ounces a week.

1102
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:12,629
Not how we're eating it now.

1103
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:15,490
We are gorging on meat,
eating huge amounts.

1104
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,823
- Does that include cheese?
- Yeah, yeah.

1105
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:21,465
- Some 60 grams in total?
- Yes, cheese and milk.

1106
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:23,613
Only 60 grams per
week seems nothing.

1107
01:09:23,848 --> 01:09:26,281
People could probably
produce that at home.

1108
01:09:26,448 --> 01:09:29,199
Maybe backyard farming
was a sustainable solution.

1109
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:30,698
I have 42 ducks.

1110
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:33,531
I started with three ducks
three years ago.

1111
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:39,157
Those burdened into
a population.

1112
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:41,576
I buy a 70-pound seed bag.

1113
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:45,577
That seed bag will
last about two weeks.

1114
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,981
The ducks that we're gonna be
culling are about two years old.

1115
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,054
When you're living with them,
they get used to you.

1116
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,857
They're not intimidated or whatever.

1117
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,858
And so they make all their
vocal sounds, like natural.

1118
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,162
Slow down.

1119
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,200
Easy, easy, easy.

1120
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,804
Okay.

1121
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,542
No, we're gonna keep you.

1122
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,780
Run. These two go first.

1123
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,687
Being smart-wise?

1124
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,226
Compared to a chicken,
they're probably the same.

1125
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,968
-That one's nice, see?
-Yeah, he is.

1126
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,907
Alrighty.

1127
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:53,145
Okay.

1128
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,049
Right there.

1129
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,268
That's gonna be a little gruesome.

1130
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:18,373
How could that still be alive?

1131
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,041
They're not.

1132
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,743
That's eh nerves.

1133
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,744
A nerve reaction.

1134
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,784
Five years old or something
like that, I think it was

1135
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,785
the first time my dad came
out and made us watch

1136
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,123
as we did rabbits.

1137
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,959
We'd raise probably a couple
dozen rabbits each year.

1138
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:48,099
Then we would take those
rabbits and skin them

1139
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,772
and clean them up and
keep them for food.

1140
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,773
As a young kid,
I was kind of…

1141
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,610
I don't want to say it was hard,
but it was kind of, from my memory…

1142
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:03,251
some of the rabbits
I had named.

1143
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:06,252
So I was kind of
like going hmm

1144
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:11,123
After doing it a couple times,
you kind of just learned

1145
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:14,126
it's just something
that has to be done.

1146
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,335
Not the fingers.

1147
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,447
l just can't do it.

1148
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:36,085
I don't think I could have someone
else do it for me, if I can't do it.

1149
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:39,885
If l can't do it, I don't want
someone else doing it for me.

1150
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,256
And then sustainability --

1151
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:47,257
For sustainability,
32 kg is 900 gr per…

1152
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,996
So it's a 450 gr per week per duck.

1153
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,101
52 weeks, 50 kg.

1154
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,904
So it's 50 kg of food

1155
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,975
for 450-700 grams of meat.

1156
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:07,978
So on a sustainability
issue, it's 100 to 1.

1157
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:12,380
And that grain gets.. you know
who knows where the grain comes from?

1158
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:16,480
But I mean, when it gets to this point,
it's not even about sustainability...

1159
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,459
it was just…

1160
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,129
You know, I don't feel real good inside.

1161
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,231
It's the first time
I've ever seen that.

1162
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,232
So kind of....

1163
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:30,169
Yeah.

1164
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,909
I'd been so caught up in the destruction
caused by animal agriculture

1165
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,945
I realised I'd never truly dwelled
on the obvious reality

1166
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,514
that every one of these
animals was killed.

1167
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:42,885
It was always a disconnected,
abstract fact of eating meat.

1168
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,890
But when it became personal,
face to face, the story changed.

1169
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:52,294
I had scheduled weeks in advance
to film another backyard slaughter

1170
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,529
of a chicken that
stopped producing eggs.

1171
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:58,530
I didn't know how I was gonna possibly
go through another slaughter.

1172
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:02,201
So I didn't.

1173
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:24,820
Animal Place is a farm animal sanctuary
in Northern California that focuses

1174
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:27,762
on rescuing animals from the
animal agriculture industry.

1175
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:31,760
A lot of people don't realise meat-breed
chickens like this guy behind us

1176
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,834
they're generally slaughtered
at about 42 days old.

1177
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,837
Whereas chickens that are bred
for egg production are killed

1178
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,776
when their productivity
starts to decrease

1179
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,777
when they start laying less eggs.

1180
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:49,947
That generally happens
about 18 to 20 months.

1181
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,890
It doesn't matter if you buy caged
eggs, eggs from cage-free farms

1182
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,891
or free-range or pasture-based farms.

1183
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,892
Hi, Carol. It doesn't matter.

1184
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:03,465
Turns out there's a successful movement
of sustainable animal-alternative

1185
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,167
food producers based right
here in California

1186
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,168
funded by big names like
Bill Gates and Biz Stone.

1187
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,575
When egg-laying hens eat
all that soy and corn

1188
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:17,445
you have an energy conversion
ratio at about 38 to 1

1189
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,881
whereas alternatively
you can find plants,

1190
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,882
you can grow those plants
and convert those plants into food.

1191
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:25,985
The energy conversion ratio
for the plants we're using

1192
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:30,389
to replace the eggs is about 2 to 1,
compared to 38 to 1 for eggs.

1193
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,260
So our explicit goal is to have
the maximum amount of impact

1194
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:40,490
by creating this new model that makes
the global egg industry entirely obsolete.

1195
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,505
We're making Omega products

1196
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:47,506
proving we make better tasting
food that's great for you

1197
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:51,980
and it takes one-twentieth of the land
and resources that dairy do.

1198
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,118
If you could have the fibre structure,
satiating bite, the protein

1199
01:15:56,118 --> 01:16:00,300
and the nutritional benefits of meat
without having animal protein itself

1200
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,190
and by doing that you
could address climate change,

1201
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:06,191
human health epidemics that
we're seeing, animal welfare

1202
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,595
and natural resource conservation.
Would you make the change?

1203
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,234
But what if people just ate
less animal products?

1204
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,234
Like going meatless on Mondays.

1205
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:20,606
When you go meatless on Monday,
you essentially contribute

1206
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:22,443
to climate change, pollution

1207
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,444
depletion of our planet's
resources and your own health

1208
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,447
then only six days of
the week, instead of seven.

1209
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:33,280
You're creating a false justification,
clearly a false justification

1210
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:35,890
for what you're doing
on those other six days.

1211
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,891
So in other words, we really shouldn't
be resting on our laurels

1212
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:43,794
of what you do right only
one-seventh of the time.

1213
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:48,901
You can't be an environmentalist
and eat animal products, period.

1214
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,271
Kid yourself if you want, if you want
to feed your addiction, so be it.

1215
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,909
But don't call yourself
an environmentalist.

1216
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,612
I knew I had to stop eating
all animal products.

1217
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:04,610
I wanted to help the planet be sustainable,
but I needed to sustain myself.

1218
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:08,123
I had doubts about being healthy
and not eating meat, dairy and eggs.

1219
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,692
All I knew was the standard
American diet I grew up on.

1220
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:14,692
Is it even possible to be
a healthy vegetarian or vegan?

1221
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:23,535
(Physician True North Health Center)
I became vegan 32 years ago now.

1222
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,674
I run several miles every day.

1223
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,610
I go biking 60 km
through the countryside.

1224
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,245
I work long hours.

1225
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,246
I feel great. It's nice waking up
in a light, trim body everyday.

1226
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,385
And so many of my vegan
friends and patients

1227
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,986
are thriving since their
transition to a vegan diet.

1228
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:45,060
So yes. I've seen vegan moms
go through healthy vegan pregnancies

1229
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:47,061
and deliver healthy vegan children

1230
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:51,062
and raise them to tall, full-sized,
intelligent vegan adults.

1231
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:55,890
And yes, certainly all the nutrients are
there in the plant kingdom to do this,

1232
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,738
that is correct.

1233
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,739
Think anyone should be
consuming dairy?

1234
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:03,778
I really don't.

1235
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,614
When you think about it,
the purpose of cows' milk--

1236
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,615
I grew on a dairy farm in Wisconsin.

1237
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,785
The purpose of cows' milk is
to turn a 65-pound calf

1238
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:19,289
into a 200 kilo cow
as rapidly as possible.

1239
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:23,928
Cows' milk is baby-calf growth fluid.

1240
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,333
It's what the stuff is.

1241
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:31,334
Everything in that white liquid,
the hormones, the lipids, the proteins

1242
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:37,208
every one of those is meant to blow
the calf up to a great big cow

1243
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,081
or it wouldn't be there.

1244
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,750
And whether you pour it
on your cereals as a liquid

1245
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,751
whether you clot it into yogurt

1246
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:49,223
whether you ferment it into cheese

1247
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,224
whether you freeze it into ice cream

1248
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,661
it's baby-calf growth fluid.

1249
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,666
And women eat it and it
stimulates their tissues...

1250
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,667
and gives women breast lumps,
it makes the uterus get big

1251
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:05,474
and they get fibroids and they bleed
and they get hysterectomies

1252
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:09,474
and they need mammograms
and gives guys man boobs.

1253
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,779
This is…

1254
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,548
Cows' milk is the lactation secretions

1255
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:17,549
of a large bovine mammal
who just had a baby.

1256
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,121
It's for baby calves.

1257
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,256
I tell my patients,
"Go look in the mirror.

1258
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,825
Do you have big ears, a tail,
are you a baby calf?

1259
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,826
If you're not, don't be eating
baby-calf growth fluid."

1260
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:28,829
In any level, there's
nothing in it people need.

1261
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:34,669
It was a relief to hear l didn't
have to eat animal products

1262
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:36,504
to be healthy and even thrive

1263
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:40,208
but I still thought you needed animal
manure to grow organic agriculture.

1264
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:42,209
Turns out there's an entire movement

1265
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,079
with people growing food
without any animal inputs.

1266
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,080
I visited Earthworks
Urban Farm in Detroit.

1267
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,318
They work with and grow food
for the low-income community.

1268
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:55,919
We tend to see ourselves
as individuals in a bubble

1269
01:19:56,025 --> 01:20:00,325
but forget that we inhabit this land
and this earth with other creatures.

1270
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,428
So we have to learn how
to share more, I guess.

1271
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,865
Jah here is working on his garden.

1272
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:11,303
You'd be surprised what you can
do with not a lot of space.

1273
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:13,340
About 1,2 by 2,5 yeah.

1274
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,711
What's your goal this year? How much
do you think you can maximise?

1275
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:19,711
I would push for 45 at least. At least.
- 45 kilos.

1276
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,216
That's amazing.

1277
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,217
One full year after
this was constructed

1278
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:29,421
we doubled our yield to
over 6,350 kg of food.

1279
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,758
6,350 kilos? On about
how many hectares?

1280
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,628
About one.

1281
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:37,629
So as much food as we
produce and we grow

1282
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,934
or the earth helps us grow...

1283
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,837
We also have to return those
nutrients back to the soil.

1284
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,940
We think of our work
as being regenerative.

1285
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,805
That we're putting as much
life-giving substance in the ground...

1286
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,312
as we're taking out.

1287
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,913
So is it just kind of healthier
and safer to use vegetarian

1288
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,650
- or vegetable composting stuff?
- That's what we found.

1289
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,953
Also because it takes less time
and it's a lot easier to manage.

1290
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,424
- A lot easier, yeah.
- Yeah.

1291
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:07,225
- And the soil's just as rich?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1292
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,763
Not only is vegan more compassionate,
it's also more efficient.

1293
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,766
And in a society with this
many billions of people

1294
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,671
we need to be as
efficient as possible.

1295
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:22,672
Some people might go back and say
if we embraced this primitive approach

1296
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,878
of only wild animals everywhere

1297
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,883
and we go back to a
hunter-gatherer system,

1298
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,417
that sounds great.

1299
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,418
But that was 10 million people
on the entire continent.

1300
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,722
Maybe a little bit more, a little
bit less, no one really knows.

1301
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,793
Today, now we have what?

1302
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:43,494
We have 320 million in the US,
25 million in Canada.

1303
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,565
Another 100 and so-many-
million in Mexico.

1304
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:51,902
So, North America is up to
almost 450 million people.

1305
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,208
Trying to figure out a way
to bring animal agriculture

1306
01:21:56,411 --> 01:22:00,991
in balance with 450 million
hungry people is impossible.

1307
01:22:01,952 --> 01:22:06,982
This is amazing, I didn't believe
it when I first learned it

1308
01:22:06,988 --> 01:22:09,957
but 216,000 people are
born to the planet every day.

1309
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,226
Every day.

1310
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,961
It's extraordinary.

1311
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,962
But what's really extraordinary
is you need, per day

1312
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,034
14,000 new hectares of farmable land.

1313
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,369
It's not happening.

1314
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,705
To feed a person on a
vegan diet for a year

1315
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:27,441
requires just 675 m2 of land.

1316
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,744
To feed that same person
on a vegetarian diet

1317
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:33,281
that includes eggs and dairy
requires three times as much land.

1318
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,983
To feed an average US citizen's
high-consumption diet

1319
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:38,984
of meat, dairy and eggs
requires 18 times as much land.

1320
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,258
This is because you can produce
17,000 kilos of vegetables

1321
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:48,258
on 0,6 ha, but only 170 kilos
of meat on the same plot of land.

1322
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,565
The comparison doesn't
end with land use.

1323
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:54,803
A vegan diet produces half as
much CO2 as an American omnivore,

1324
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,338
uses one-eleventh the
amount of fossil fuels

1325
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:01,009
one-thirteenth the amount of water
and an eighteenth of the amount of land.

1326
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:04,909
After adding this all up, I realised
I had the choice every single day

1327
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:09,646
to save over 4100 litres
of water, 20 kilos of grain

1328
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:14,218
10 m2 of forested land,
the equivalent of 9 kilos of CO2

1329
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,322
and one animal's life
every single day.

1330
01:23:18,095 --> 01:23:22,963
If we all did go vegan and
moved away from animal foods

1331
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,566
and toward a plant-based
diet, what would happen?

1332
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:28,967
If we didn't kill all
these cows and eat them

1333
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,805
then we wouldn't have
to breed all these cows

1334
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,806
because we're breeding cows
and chickens and pigs and fish.

1335
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,644
We're breeding them over
and over again, relentlessly.

1336
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:41,245
If we didn't breed them,
we wouldn't have to feed them.

1337
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,349
Then we wouldn't have
to devote all this land

1338
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,120
to grow grains and legumes
and so forth to feed to them.

1339
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,123
So the forest
could come back.

1340
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,327
Wildlife could come back.

1341
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:56,328
The oceans would come back.
The rivers would run clean again.

1342
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:59,364
The air would come back.
Our health would return.

1343
01:24:00,137 --> 01:24:05,637
Renewable energy infrastructure,
such as solar and wind generators

1344
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,776
to reduce climate change,
that's a pretty good idea

1345
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,145
but it's projected to take
at least 20 years

1346
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:15,146
and at least, minimally,
$18 trillion to develop.

1347
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,650
It's important to realise
that we don't have that long.

1348
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,891
We just talked about how it might
be a three to four year time frame,

1349
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:27,362
so we don't have 20 years and we don't
have $18 trillion to develop these.

1350
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:32,362
Another solution to climate change:
we could stop eating animals.

1351
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:36,267
It could be done today. It
doesn't have to take 20 years

1352
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:40,371
and it doesn't have to take $18
trillion, because it costs nothing.

1353
01:24:40,644 --> 01:24:44,745
Some say, "Fix CO2, then
worry about methane."

1354
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:49,546
It's the other way. Do something about
methane and you get a response right away.

1355
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:53,985
The most powerful thing that someone
can do for the environment,

1356
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,890
no other lifestyle choice has
a farther reaching

1357
01:24:56,891 --> 01:25:00,891
and more profoundly positive impact
on the planet and all life on Earth

1358
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:05,929
than choosing to stop consuming
animals and live a vegan lifestyle.

1359
01:25:06,035 --> 01:25:09,536
Do you realise 75
percent of Americans

1360
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:12,937
consider themselves
to be an environmentalist?

1361
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:18,113
You don't think we couldn't solve
this problem in a heartbeat?

1362
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:21,913
I'll tell you what,
all we would need

1363
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:26,016
is for the environmentalists
to live what they profess

1364
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:30,921
and we'd be on a new
course in the world.

1365
01:25:32,596 --> 01:25:37,464
We will not succeed until
we stop animal agriculture.

1366
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,032
And by "succeed," I mean

1367
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:42,033
we will not save ecosystems
to the extent necessary,

1368
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,740
we will not have enough food
for people around the planet

1369
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,975
we will not stop global warming,

1370
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,976
we will not stop pollution
in the dead zones that run of

1371
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:56,012
all the fields of corn and soy
that are grown to feed livestock

1372
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,057
and we will not stop the hunting
of wolves and other predators.

1373
01:26:00,057 --> 01:26:05,990
Organic farming is one step in the right
direction, but we need to keep walking.

1374
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,827
We need to get beyond organics.
We need to get to sustainability.

1375
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:14,833
When you take the animal out, you
take the greenhouse gas issue out.

1376
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,171
you take the food
safety issues out

1377
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:20,508
you take some other externalities
related to food scarcity out.

1378
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,908
But one thing that's amazing is
I think you put our values back in.

1379
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:29,980
Values like compassion
and integrity and kindness

1380
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:34,985
values that are natural to
human beings, you put that in

1381
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:38,623
you build that back into
the story of our food.

1382
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:44,593
I think as this begins to progress,
I think it also helps people to pause.

1383
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:47,501
Before they eat that egg,
before they eat that steak,

1384
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,636
before they eat that
chicken nugget

1385
01:26:49,637 --> 01:26:53,637
and ask themselves, is
that really what they want?

1386
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,875
Or do they actually
want something more?

1387
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,046
I had to come to
the full conclusion

1388
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:02,047
the only way to sustainably
and ethically live on this planet

1389
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:06,250
with 7 billion other people is to
live an entirely plant-based vegan diet.

1390
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:10,121
I decided instead of eating
others, to eat for others.

1391
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:14,220
At first, like these environmental groups,
I was afraid of what it'd mean to change.

1392
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,029
But now I embrace it.

1393
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:20,530
All this talk about sustainability sounded
like our planet was on life support.

1394
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:24,535
I don't want her to simply
survive or to sustain, but to thrive.

1395
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,672
Life today is not about sustainability.
It's about "thrive-ability."

1396
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:32,676
She's given so much to us for so
long, it was time to give back.

1397
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,649
A hundred-and-eight percent
of everything we have.

1398
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:38,650
It felt good. It was an alignment.

1399
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,989
We see this movement,
not just about providing cheaper

1400
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:47,295
inexpensive food that everyone
can have, but also a spiritual move.

1401
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,797
A move towards understanding
who we really are

1402
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:51,798
and how we can
connect to each other.

1403
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:56,159
Do what you can do as
well as you can do it,

1404
01:27:56,179 --> 01:27:59,979
every day of your life,

1405
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:05,172
and you will die one of the happiest
individuals that ever died.

1406
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,379
We become part of a gathering
momentum of other people.

1407
01:28:08,383 --> 01:28:11,786
It's happening. This is really
what's happening. This is the news.

1408
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,887
Selflessness is a nice way to be.

1409
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:18,000
It has all these benefits for yourself,
as well as the planet and other people.

1410
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:20,661
It's a beautiful way to live.

1411
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,963
Ecologically it
just feels better.

1412
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,666
This is about massively transforming

1413
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:29,667
how our society eats,
because it's a necessity.

1414
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,071
It's acting on what we know.

1415
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,841
And acting kindly and gently
on the whole planet

1416
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:41,911
and with other people to accomplish
the goals of living better.

1417
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:46,717
We can do it, but we
have to choose to do it.

1418
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:51,056
You can change the world.

1419
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:55,056
You must change the world.
