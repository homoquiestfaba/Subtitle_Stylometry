00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,184
"Apartment For Rent
Furnished Spacious Loft $ 700"

2
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,688
MANAGER

3
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,237
Here you go.

4
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:09,090
Well, the furniture's not new
but it's in pretty good shape.

5
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,754
And it's just been steamed today.

6
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:14,308
- It's beautiful!
- Yes it is.

7
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:20,404
The morning sun can be pretty intense,
especially if you're a night owl like me.

8
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:24,202
No, no, I'm a morning person.
Best light for painting.

9
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:25,185
You an artist?

10
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,642
Well that's what I'm here to find out.

11
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,638
Well, then this place
is perfect for you.

12
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,600
Quiet building...
Nice neighborhood...

13
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,986
A fairly nice neighborhood...
considering the area.

14
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,151
Besides,

15
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,892
you got me.
Right next door.

16
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:44,645
Yeah...

17
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,458
So...

18
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:49,760
The bathroom is over
here behind the stairs.

19
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,617
And the bedroom is
right upstairs in the loft.

20
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,725
Is this the only closet?

21
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,220
Yeah, I'm afraid it is.

22
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,485
This... used to be a real wood
burning fire place here...

23
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:28,382
but now it just operates on gas.

24
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:30,509
You know...
no fuss no muss, huh?

25
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,945
I'll take it!

26
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,504
Great!
When would you like to move in?

27
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:36,705
Next week?

28
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:38,207
That soon?

29
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:42,798
Okay well, you can sign the lease
now and Elaine can sign it tonight.

30
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,721
- Elaine?
- My wife.

31
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,183
She's the one that
actually owns the building.

32
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,145
And I guess should warn you...

33
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,897
She's a bit... eccentric.

34
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,027
- What do you mean?
- Oh!  She's harmless...

35
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,534
It's just that she still
thinks that it's 1969.

36
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:00,821
You still want to move in?

37
00:04:01,635 --> 00:04:02,970
I... yeah!

38
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:05,308
Well then.  Welcome, neighbor.

39
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:06,498
What's your name?

40
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,000
Paige Benedict.

41
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,293
Paige... well, I'm
Jonas Lowrey.

42
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:14,440
If you need anything, you
call me... day or night.

43
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:17,564
I think I'll be fine.
Thanks.

44
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,877
Oolaa...

45
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:06,521
You're the new girl in unit "C" right?

46
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,645
Yeah, and you must be Jonah's wife.

47
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:11,388
How did you know that?

48
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,490
Lucky guess.

49
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:16,392
Elaine Lowrey.

50
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,093
Paige Benedict.

51
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,247
And this is  Doo.

52
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,689
Far out!
He likes you.

53
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,591
Oh boy!

54
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,785
I named him after the song...

55
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,229
The song?

56
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,916
You know?  Me and you
and a dog named "Doo".

57
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:44,337
Well, I think the song is
"Me, you and a dog named Boo".

58
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,480
What...?

59
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:47,881
No...

60
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,759
Who name their dog "Boo".
That's a a stupid name.

61
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,654
Isn't it, baby?
Yes it is.

62
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,339
Wow, that looks like it weighs a ton.

63
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,210
Yeah.  Feels like it too.

64
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:09,740
What are you standing here
rapping with me for?

65
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:12,711
Get it inside before
it breaks your back.

66
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,558
Good idea!
Thanks.

67
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,995
Get a grip, Paige.
It's only a Ouija board.

68
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,265
Okay!
The phones all hooked up.

69
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,556
You got any cold beers in there?

70
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:36,658
No.

71
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,251
All I got is a coke.

72
00:07:38,286 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh!  That's all you got.

73
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:02,662
Hello!

74
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,220
Anybody home?

75
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,428
YES

76
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:36,937
Hello?

77
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,104
Is there anybody there?

78
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,741
Hello?

79
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,739
Is there somebody here?

80
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,963
Oh my God!
These things really work?

81
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,165
YES

82
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,267
Who are you?

83
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,472
S... U...

84
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:06,897
S...

85
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,399
A...

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
N...

87
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,602
Susan!

88
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,003
YES

89
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,605
Hi Susan,

90
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:16,906
I'm... I'm Paige.

91
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,508
Hello

92
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:21,309
What are you doing here?

93
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:26,210
P... R...

94
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,238
O...

95
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:29,571
M...

96
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:30,908
O...

97
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,210
A promo ...?

98
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,412
A promotion!

99
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,539
You know about the promotion?

100
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
Am I going to get it?

101
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,942
Susan?

102
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,209
GOODBYE

103
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,013
Sorry.

104
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:01,653
I didn't mean to startle you.

105
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,938
Mitch, what are you doing here?

106
00:10:06,497 --> 00:10:07,840
You forgot this.

107
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,254
I thought you might
need it for your CPA exam.

108
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,251
And really, Paige...

109
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,352
the question is...

110
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:16,853
What are you doing here?

111
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:19,416
I mean... look at this place,
it's a dump.

112
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,813
It's an artist loft...

113
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,482
And living here is going
to make you an artist...

114
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,164
I am an artist!

115
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:30,277
Why?

116
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:32,598
Because you did a couple of
drawings when you were a kid?

117
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,130
You know, if you really
wanted to paint, Paige,

118
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,857
you could have just set
your stuff up in the garage.

119
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,624
You didn't have to move out.

120
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,824
You don't understand...

121
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,392
Yeah, you're right, I don't understand.

122
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,124
Why don't you explain it to me?

123
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:48,510
I tried to...
You wouldn't listen.

124
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:50,543
Well, I'm all ears now.

125
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,609
Mitch... I...

126
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,436
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,437
Can't do what?

128
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,804
Mitch, please!

129
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:01,970
Talk to me, Paige!

130
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:05,315
- I can't!
- Just talk to me, God dammit!

131
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,216
Excuse me.

132
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,779
Is everything alright in here?

133
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,352
Yes, everything's fine.

134
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:23,539
You know, man...

135
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,031
maybe you should go find yourself
some business or something...

136
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,227
because right now
you're in mine, okay?

137
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,429
Well...

138
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,171
Actually this is my business.

139
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:36,547
You see, my sister
owns the building...

140
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:39,900
And , I'm pretty
sure she has a policy

141
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,334
against her tenants being harassed.

142
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,868
So?

143
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,270
So.

144
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,127
You're not really going to
make me call the police, are you?

145
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,232
I am the police.

146
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you still here?

147
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,164
25-O-5,
Right?

148
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,365
What?

149
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,667
Your badge number.

150
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:28,827
I just want to make
sure I had it right.

151
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,159
So, when you call your superiors

152
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,460
so I can tell 'em...

153
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,874
what great work you're doing
for public relations down here!

154
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:07,224
Thanks.

155
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,674
- Russell Upton.
- Paige Benedict.

156
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,294
You must have a whole hell
a lot of unpaid parking fines...

157
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:20,186
No... he's my ex-boyfriend.

158
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:25,158
MENTONE & SONS
ACCOUNTING FIRM

159
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,463
Carla?

160
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,065
Wait.
Hold on a second.

161
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,985
Have you seen my books
for the Eden account?

162
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:52,273
I left them on Henry's desk
last night but he can't find them.

163
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,634
Why are you asking me?

164
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,036
Well I... am...

165
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,533
you were the last one in there.

166
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,722
George, I'll call you back.
Okay.

167
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,732
What are you accusing me of?

168
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,233
Nothing...

169
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,235
I. .. I just... um

170
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:17,440
Well you know...

171
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:21,912
we're both up for this
CPA position, and I...

172
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,213
Listen to me, Paige...

173
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,220
Do you really think I
need steal your work

174
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,317
in order to beat you
out of this promotion?

175
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:32,453
No!

176
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,626
I don't... know...

177
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:37,948
I guess not.

178
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,244
Then why don't you go and
look for it somewhere else?

179
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,188
Oolaa!

180
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,402
Have you met any of
the other tenants yet?

181
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:55,347
No... not yet.

182
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,373
What about the guys behind you?

183
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,429
You haven't heard any strange noises?

184
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,019
Oh, what do you mean?

185
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,633
Well.

186
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,959
They claim they're just roommates,

187
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,029
but I have my doubts.

188
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,147
Not that I would
say anything though

189
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:15,139
because like I don't dig gossip.

190
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,911
Not like Wanda Esbell.

191
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,112
Who?

192
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,533
The writer in unit "B".

193
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,372
Never smiles.

194
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,912
Never sets foot out of her apartment.

195
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:33,215
Never has a pleasant thing
to say about anybody.

196
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,637
You know everyone in
this building, don't you?

197
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,381
I am the landlady.

198
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,578
Did you ever know anyone named Susan?

199
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:48,938
You mean Susan Sidney?

200
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,444
I. .. I don't know.
Or maybe ...

201
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,297
Did she use to live here?

202
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,040
Two years ago.
Why?

203
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:58,755
I found a Ouija board in the closet...

204
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:04,652
Hi, Paige!

205
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:07,320
- Get settle in okay?
- Oh yeah, thanks.

206
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,278
Oh, Christ!
I'm sorry about that.

207
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,738
Oh, it's okay.

208
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,107
Listen, I'm the handyman around here.

209
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,523
So if you ever need anything,

210
00:16:17,674 --> 00:16:19,746
and I mean anything,

211
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,188
just let me know.

212
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,429
Ahhh... thanks.

213
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,495
You're making a fool
of yourself, Jonas.

214
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,897
Come on.

215
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,769
The shower drain is clogged again.

216
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,531
It's because you keep washing
your goddamn mud in there.

217
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:39,314
Well, I have to clean him, don't I?

218
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:41,378
Well, hose him off in the backyard.

219
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,305
He's a dog, for Christ sakes!

220
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:46,409
Shhh!  He's sensitive...

221
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:51,081
You know he doesn't
dig being called a D-O-G.

222
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:53,215
Come on, Doo,

223
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,509
Mommy and Daddy are going upstairs.

224
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,623
Elaine, you get way too
many drugs and weird stuff.

225
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,013
Russel!  Are you crazy?
You nearly scared me to death!

226
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,535
Yeah.
My death.

227
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,172
I'm... I'm... I'm
so sorry.

228
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:20,671
God I'm sorry...

229
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,906
Oh God, it must have hurt.

230
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:26,277
I don't know what came over me.

231
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:29,074
Is there anything I can do for you?

232
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,575
Yeah!

233
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,176
Kill me!

234
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,078
I'm sorry.

235
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,597
I don't mean to laugh.

236
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:41,907
Oh here, let me.

237
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:51,811
There.

238
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,082
How are you feeling now?

239
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:55,419
Better?

240
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh, yeah, yeah!

241
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,508
I always welcome new
tenants by writhing around

242
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,029
in the dust and he's
groaning in agony.

243
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,491
I still can't believe I did that.

244
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,553
I'm usually not that aggressive.

245
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,921
What are you doing
down here, anyway?

246
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:11,552
Checking the boiler for leaks.

247
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,184
Shouldn't Jonas be doing that?

248
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,580
He is the handyman, isn't he?

249
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,613
I'm the handyman is more like it.

250
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:27,781
You've got a great
face, you know that?

251
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:33,154
I'm not coming on to you.
I'm a photographer.

252
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:38,173
Would you consider
posing for me some time?

253
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:43,800
I don't think so.
I'd be way too self-conscious.

254
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:47,716
Okay I don't to push it.
But ...

255
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:51,509
Here is my card.
In case you change your mind.

256
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:59,110
Did Susan Sidney pose for you?

257
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:02,449
- You knew Susan?
- Uh, Elaine mentioned her.

258
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,667
Figures.

259
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:07,654
There's 3 forms of mass
communication around here.

260
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,481
Telephone, telefax and tell-Elaine.

261
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:15,126
What was she like?
Susan I mean?

262
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:20,912
Smart, sexy,
totally independent.

263
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:22,696
And very tough.

264
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:26,577
She'd kicked me just like you did,
but she never would have apologized.

265
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,153
So what were you and Elaine
talking about her anyway?

266
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:33,197
I found a ouija board and
I think it might be hers.

267
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:34,863
Probably is.

268
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,467
She was really into
all that occult stuff.

269
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,903
And yes, she did pose for me.

270
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:44,365
I can't believe I'm doing this...

271
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,652
Susan!

272
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:47,286
Are you still here?

273
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:51,709
Susan?

274
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,394
Susan, is your last name Sidney?

275
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,353
YES

276
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,200
And, um...

277
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:01,759
this is your ouija board.

278
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:03,958
YES

279
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,700
What are you doing here?

280
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:08,361
A...

281
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,264
R...

282
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,065

00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:15,168
S...

285
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:16,906
T...
Artist?

286
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,480
Are you an artist?

287
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,318
H...

288
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,655

290
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,893
P...
Help?

291
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,402
You need help?
Or you mean you're here to help me?

292
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:39,081
Susan?

293
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,709
Susan, what do you mean?

294
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,158
Whoa!

295
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,112
Who did that?

296
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:26,705
Susan, what are you doing?

297
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,150
What the hell...?

298
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:43,366
Susan!
Are you alright?

299
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,067
E...

300
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:48,104
D...

301
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,505
E...

302
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:51,170
N...

303
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,009
Eden?

304
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,860
The Eden account?

305
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:55,559
You know where my books are?

306
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:57,278
C...

307
00:27:58,446 --> 00:27:59,581
A...

308
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:02,083
R...

309
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:03,884
L...

310
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:06,735
A...
Carla?

311
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,290
That bitch!

312
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,533
EDEN COSMETICS FISCAL YEAR 1993

313
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,999
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

314
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:49,690
This is my office, my desk!
How dare you come in here like this.

315
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,988
- And you get out of here before...
- Shut the fuck up.

316
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,756
If you ever...
pull a stunt like this again,

317
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,323
you're going to need a calculator and
count all the teeth you'll be missing.

318
00:29:19,294 --> 00:29:20,819
Hello!
Paige Benedict.

319
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,321
Paige!
It's Mitch.

320
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:24,714
Listen, I think we should talk.

321
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:26,354
Mitch, I'm at work.

322
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:29,249
Well, you wouldn't talk to
me in your apartment, so...

323
00:29:29,382 --> 00:29:31,113
You weren't talking,
you were yelling...

324
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:33,100
and I'm not putting
up with it anymore.

325
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,485
Damn it, Paige!
Just listen to what I have...!

326

Russell Upton

327
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:00,137
Beautiful, Paige!
... Beautiful!

328
00:30:00,538 --> 00:30:01,739
Now be sexy.

329
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,201
This is the sexiest I can...

330
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,897
Come on!
You're not even trying...

331
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,825
It has nothing to do with trying...

332
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,548
- I'm just not sexy.
- I don't believe it!

333
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,794
Here, lick your lips!

334
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:21,923
I said lick them, not swallow them.

335
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:26,504
I'm sorry.
I just feel silly...

336
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,429
That's because you're posing.

337
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:32,257
Try to be more natural.
Pretend I'm not here.

338
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:35,362
Oh!
Easier said than done.

339
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:36,505
Okay

340
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:39,111
Then, forget the camera.
Just talk.

341
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:43,084
- Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?

342
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:47,320
- Whatever you want to tell me.
- Okay.

343
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:52,601
I'm an only child, born and
raised on a farm in Indiana.

344
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:57,583
My parents were very
old fashioned and very strict.

345
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:01,257
- I could have guessed that much.
- How come?

346
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:05,695
- You dress like Mary Poppins.
- I beg your pardon.

347
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,167
Perfect!
See, there's a natural pose...

348
00:31:08,437 --> 00:31:11,579
Good enough for my
driver's license, I'm sure.

349
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,147
So how long you've
been interested in art?

350
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:19,144
Oh!  Guys lyings I can remember...

351
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:24,481
When the other little girls were playing
jump rope, I was doing charcoal sketches.

352
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,753
Then how did you end up an accountant?

353
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:31,532
Well, I wanted to go to Art School
and become a painter

354
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:35,085
but my father wanted me to go
to college and study business.

355
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,509
He said a career in art was too risky.

356
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,484
So we compromised.  I went to
college and studied business.

357
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,673
You always do what your father wants?

358
00:31:47,936 --> 00:31:50,109
Until he died last year.

359
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,802
And then I decided to do what I want.

360
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,986
Move out here, and become a painter.

361
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,700
- So what happened?
- I met Mitch ...

362
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:04,285
and fell into the same doormat
relationship I had with my father.

363
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,635
And you eventually give up painting.

364
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:12,409
Well, that didn't take much.
I hadn't drawn anything in 4 years.

365
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:16,050
I don't ... sorry, it's like I have
writer's block or something.

366
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:22,457
And I'm not very good at confrontation.
At least not until today.

367
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:25,760
- What happened today?
- I don't know.

368
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:30,195
I guess I just got tired
of always playing it safe.

369
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:33,997
Is that what made you
change your mind about posing?

370
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:39,201
POLICE

371
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:49,806
CORONER

372
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:18,615
What happened?

373
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:21,475
It's Jonas.
He's had an accident.

374
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:23,281
What?
How?

375
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:24,582
The boiler.

376
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:28,245
I begged him to stop drinking...!
I begged him!

377
00:33:28,246 --> 00:33:29,758
He must have been
drunk out of his mind.

378
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,244
She said it looked like he hit the
boiler room door with every tool he had.

379
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,552
Where is Doo?
Where is my dog?

380
00:33:36,587 --> 00:33:38,908
I'm sure he's fine.  He's probably
in the apartment somewhere.

381
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:42,017
- Don't believe I knew!
- Okay, okay, okay.

382
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:13,751
Hello?

383
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:16,450
Paige?  It's Henry.
Are you coming in today?

384
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:24,960
You know...?  Um...
I'm really not feeling that good, Henry.

385
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,207
I think I'm getting
the flu or something.

386
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:29,033
Oh well, that explains it then.

387
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:30,795
I figured it had to be
something pretty serious

388
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:32,656
in order for you to
miss a day of work.

389
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:37,090
Oh, yeah!  You know.
I'm sorry I didn't call.

390
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:38,888
I slept right through my alarm.

391
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,619
No, no, no!
I understand.

392
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:44,256
- You just get well quick, okay?
- Yeah okay.  Thanks, I will.

393
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:02,302
Who is it?

394
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,507
Paige, it's me.

395
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,005
What do you want?

396
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,133
Well, I heard about the
accident here yesterday

397
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:11,388
and I wanted to make
sure that you are alright.

398
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,904
Can I come in, please?

399
00:37:32,934 --> 00:37:35,165
Christ, you look like shit!

400
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,657
You came all the way over
here just to tell me that?

401
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:39,780
No.

402
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,331
I came over here because
I wanted to make sure

403
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:43,406
that you are alright.
I was worried.

404
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,068
You did this?

405
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:51,722
Yeah?  So?

406
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:55,284
Well, it's .. it's great!

407
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:00,888
Do you really think so?

408
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:02,480
Hell, yes I think so!

409
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:04,441
Paige, when you told
me you wanted to paint

410
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:07,660
I had absolutely no idea
that you were capable of...

411
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:16,483
I guess I wasn't
very supportive, was I?

412
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,287
Right...

413
00:38:22,688 --> 00:38:26,000
Well, I should go.
I've got a watch.

414
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,438
Mitch!

415
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:32,037
Could you do me a favor?

416
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:33,739
Name it.

417
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,936
A woman named Susan Sidney.

418
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,398
She used to lived here about 2 years ago.

419
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:41,529
Could you find out how she died?

420
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:43,432
What for?

421
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:48,134
Okay.

422
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:51,067
Might take a couple of days.

423
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,460
Okay.  Thanks.

424
00:39:42,484 --> 00:39:45,277
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

425
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:48,074
The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away.

426
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,500
Rest in peace, brother Jonas.

427
00:39:52,047 --> 00:39:56,618
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

428
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,710
- Thanks for coming.
- You're welcome.

429
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:03,948
Thanks for coming.

430
00:40:16,855 --> 00:40:20,949
- You okay?
- Yeah.

431
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:23,995
I'm glad you came.

432
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:29,090
- You look great.
- Thanks.

433
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:34,252
- I didn't see Elaine anywhere.
- She hasn't accepted it yet.

434
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:38,888
- I suppose it will take time.
- More than you know.

435
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,366
Our parents died in '69,
that's why she's stuck there.

436
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,850
Russel,  I'm sorry.

437
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:49,400
It was a long time ago.
I was just a kid.

438
00:40:50,986 --> 00:40:54,395
Luckily we inherit a lot of property,
got us through the tough times.

439
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,195
Now if there's anything I
can do, you let me know.

440
00:40:58,661 --> 00:40:59,797
Thanks.

441
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:02,498
Actually, she's better off without him.

442
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,190
I mean, he was a drunk and a cheat.

443
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:05,930
- Russel!
- What?

444
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:08,326
You gonna tell me he
never made a pass at you.

445
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:13,363
I suppose.

446
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,566
You suppose.

447
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:17,736
Trust me, he went
after anything in a skirt.

448
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:19,696
Poor Elaine !

449
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:21,562
She doesn't know.

450
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:25,961
How could she not know?

451
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:28,653
She lives in her own little world.

452
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:31,521
Reality very rarely intrudes.

453
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:37,462
Do you think Jonas had an
affair with Susan Sidney?

454
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:39,365
I know he did.

455
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,332
That's how she paid her rent.

456
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,472
And Elaine never knew?

457
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:47,712
I made sure she didn't.

458
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:49,798
And Jonas, he wasn't gonna tell her.

459
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,166
So how did she die?

460
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:57,498
- Who?
- Susan of course.

461
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,112
Susan's not dead.
She moved.

462
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:02,200
I made Jonas kick her out.

463
00:42:02,902 --> 00:42:04,202
What?

464
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:17,708
Okay.

465
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,411
Who are you?

466
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:21,478
I know you're here.

467
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,010
Answer me, God damn it!

468
00:42:27,013 --> 00:42:29,273
You're not Susan Sidney, are you?

469
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:31,776
YES.

470
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:32,878
Okay.

471
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:33,980
You are Susan...

472
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:36,281
How did you die?

473
00:42:36,882 --> 00:42:48,582
M-U-R-D-E-R.
Murder?

474
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:49,982
You were murdered?

475
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:53,993
No...

476
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:59,720
I don't believe you.
Russel says Susan's still alive.

477
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:16,123
R-I-F-L-E   C-A-P-E.

478
00:43:17,002 --> 00:43:18,203
Rifle Cape?

479
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,592
What's that suppose to mean?

480
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:22,207
Susan...

481
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,432
What does it mean?

482
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:28,406
Susan, I can't help you unless
you tell me what you want.

483
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,535
BYE.

484
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:47,739
- Hello?
- Paige.

485
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,267
Hey listen, I got
that info you wanted.

486
00:43:50,368 --> 00:43:53,987
But there is no death certificate
on file for Susan Sidney anywhere.

487
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,093
<i>Are you sure she's dead?</i>

488
00:43:58,995 --> 00:43:59,930
No.

489
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:04,772
Okay, I've got to run trace and see if
I can find out if she's moved and where.

490
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:07,894
And I should have the information
for you by tonight, okay?

491
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:14,832
Hello?
You still there?

492
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:18,990
Ehhh...  yeah.
I gotta go Mitch.

493
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:21,433
Okay.

494
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:22,735
That's it!

495
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:25,167
I'm through with you,
whoever you are!

496
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,250
This thing is going out
with tonight's garbage!

497
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:29,352
NO.

498
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,199
Are you sure you're alright?

499
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,251
Maybe we should call a doctor.

500
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,070
No. .. I'm fine.
I just fainted.

501
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:13,030
You did more than that...

502
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:18,909
You... You screamed like you
were having a bad acid flashback.

503
00:45:19,694 --> 00:45:23,884
What’s going on, Paige?
When did you paint this?

504
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:29,162
What do you guys know
about Ouija boards?

505
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:32,356
Not much.
I mean supposedly

506
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:35,116
ghosts can spell out messages
with that pointer thing, right?

507
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:37,443
Do you believe that?

508
00:45:37,578 --> 00:45:38,646
No.

509
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:42,208
I figure it's probably just
your own subconscious.

510
00:45:42,768 --> 00:45:44,339
How about you?

511
00:45:45,606 --> 00:45:47,458
Last week I would have said no.

512
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:50,878
It's only a game,
like checkers or chess.

513
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:53,919
But now I...

514
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,689
I believe it.

515
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:57,784
You do?

516
00:45:58,287 --> 00:46:01,135
I'm not the only one, Russel...

517
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:07,000
Lots of people believe in spirits and
that you reach them with the Ouija board.

518
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:09,691
You can!
I mean I have!

519
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:15,783
I have been in contact with a
spirit since the day I moved in.

520
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,864
It claims to be Susan Sidney.

521
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,107
But Susan isn't dead.

522
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:24,840
Well, how do you know that?

523
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:27,584
I mean... you haven't seen
her in two years, right?

524
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:31,081
And so I've been painting again.

525
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:33,039
Susan helped me.

526
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,554
What are you talking about?
Susan was an exotic dancer.

527
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:43,666
- Susan wasn't an artist?
- A con artist maybe.

528
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,403
Halt...

529
00:46:44,404 --> 00:46:48,190
There is only one way
to find out for sure.

530
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:50,880
Susan?

531
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:53,182
If you are Susan...

532
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:55,284
Are you here?

533
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:00,888
Susan?

534
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:04,014
Ladies, this is really weird.

535
00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:06,560
- Hold it, Russel!
- I feel stupid.

536
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:08,892
Well, so did I at first.

537
00:47:16,897 --> 00:47:18,500
That's Doo.

538
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,378
Susan must be close by.

539
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,970
Susan, is that you?

540
00:47:29,632 --> 00:47:30,768
YES.

541
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:35,318
And you still claim
to be Susan Sidney?

542
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,528
YES.

543
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,790
Then you know these people with me.

544
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:42,892
YES.

545
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,330
Good.

546
00:47:45,366 --> 00:47:47,427
They want to ask you some questions.

547
00:47:47,992 --> 00:47:49,127
NO.

548
00:47:49,228 --> 00:47:50,064
No?

549
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:52,067
Why not?

550
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,664
You are Susan Sidney, right?

551
00:47:55,165 --> 00:48:05,481
U-P-T-O-W-N

552
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:07,172
Uptown?

553
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:08,673
Uptown...?

554
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,971
Susan, what's uptown.
You?

555
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:29,046
2-1-7   P-A-R-K-W-O-O-D

556
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:34,169
Wow!  217 Parkwood

557
00:48:34,909 --> 00:48:36,410
It's an address.

558
00:48:37,311 --> 00:48:38,512
Susan?

559
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:40,646
Is that where you murdered?

560
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,586
Come on, guys!
This is not Susan.

561
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:44,676
YES.

562
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:49,886
Then, what's your middle name?

563
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,013
When is your birthday?

564
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,743
Where are you from originally?

565
00:48:57,716 --> 00:48:59,172
She's getting agitated...

566
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:01,014
Why?  Because she can't
answer the lightning round?

567
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:02,478
Or maybe she's just confused.

568
00:49:02,479 --> 00:49:04,560
Oh, I am sure death
is very disorientating.

569
00:49:04,563 --> 00:49:07,380
Shut up, Russell!
You're upsetting her.

570
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:09,875
Upsetting who?
This is not Susan.

571
00:49:22,982 --> 00:49:24,782
That's it!

572
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:28,919
I don't think that's it all.
I'm splitting.

573
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:42,027
That was incredible!

574
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:50,971
Maybe you shouldn't
use this thing anymore.

575
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:03,145
There's a ...
map in the side table.

576
00:50:03,803 --> 00:50:06,362
See if you can find
Parkwood Street.

577
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:09,229
You sure you want to do this?

578
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:12,266
Yeah ... I'm sure.

579
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:28,352
- Hello?
- Paige...

580
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:32,490
Listen here.  There is absolutely
no paper on this Susan Sidney at all.

581
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:35,151
Oh so, what does that mean?

582
00:50:35,384 --> 00:50:36,944
Well, it means that when
she moved from there,

583
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:38,741
she never reestablish her new address,

584
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:42,627
not with the phone company, the
post office.  None of the utilities.

585
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:44,833
Oh, that's unusual isn't it?

586
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,850
Well ... not if she moved out of state.

587
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,430
She could have moved
in with somebody here,

588
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:51,922
who just has all the
utilities in his own name.

589
00:50:54,024 --> 00:50:56,186
Mitch, what's a Rifle Cape?

590
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:58,287
I have no idea.

591
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,971
It's not part of a gun or something?

592
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:02,192
No.

593
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:03,929
Okay.

594
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:06,392
I can't find Parkwood Street anywhere.

595
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:07,828
What?

596
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:21,141
Mitch, do you know where
217 Parkwood Street is?

597
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,346
Never heard of it.

598
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,007
You must have, it's uptown somewhere.

599
00:51:26,073 --> 00:51:27,309
No.

600
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:30,302
- Not unless...
- Unless what?

601
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,694
Are you sure you're not
talking about Park Woods?

602
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,295
Park Woods?

603
00:51:34,296 --> 00:51:35,956
Right.  The Woods.

604
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:38,689
Outside the city limits,
near the Interstate...

605
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,421
Yes! Yes!
That must be it!

606
00:51:40,522 --> 00:51:42,188
Thanks, Mitch.
I got to go.

607
00:51:46,392 --> 00:51:47,793
What's up?

608
00:51:50,396 --> 00:51:52,456
Are there any shovels in the basement?

609
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:54,693
WARNING!
NO TRESPASSING

610
00:52:11,722 --> 00:52:14,568
You know, if I were to
list every stupid stunt

611
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:17,316
I've ever pulled in my entire life,

612
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:19,713
this would rate in the top two.

613
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:22,260
We don't even know
what we're looking for!

614
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:25,712
I think this is where
Susan was killed and buried.

615
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,018
Oh, man!  I have a
bad feeling about this...

616
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:44,879
So where do we start?

617
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:48,682
She said 217 Parkwoods.
That must mean something.

618
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:51,386
What do you think?  We gonna
find a sign that says 217,

619
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:52,947
the big "X" that marks the spot?

620
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:55,052
I don't know, Russell!
It's a mystery!

621
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:56,585
You don't want to
help me figure it out, fine.

622
00:52:56,685 --> 00:52:59,778
But I've spent all my
entire life playing it safe.

623
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:03,676
I'm sick of it!
Now I need to do this.

624
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,942
Not just for Susan, but for me.

625
00:53:10,343 --> 00:53:11,809
What was that?

626
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,042
It's footsteps.

627
00:53:18,043 --> 00:53:21,527
- Someone else is here!
- Or something...

628
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,570
We are in the woods, Paige.

629
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:26,850
It could be a bear... or a cat.

630
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,036
Let's get the hell out of here.

631
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:49,531
What the hell are you two doing here?

632
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:53,036
Mitch...
Something's chasing us.

633
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:54,672
Alright, go to the
car, I'll check it out.

634
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:57,738
- No, don't go.
- Just do what I'm asking you to, ok?

635
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:00,404
Come on, Paige, let
him play Dirty Harry.

636
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:29,202
Who's there?

637
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:40,867
Here's your bogeyman.

638
00:54:44,302 --> 00:54:47,156
Have you both completely
lost your minds?

639
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:51,536
Us?   You're the one
who just shot Rocky.

640
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,343
Hey listen, Chuckle Head.
Now is not the time for you

641
00:54:54,346 --> 00:54:57,040
to impress me with your wit.
Do you understand?

642
00:54:57,075 --> 00:54:57,843
Mitch...

643
00:54:57,944 --> 00:54:59,447
No, Paige.
You don't even know this guy.

644
00:54:59,448 --> 00:55:01,478
What are you doing out in the
middle of nowhere with him?

645
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,750
She invited me.  The question is,
what are you doing out here?

646
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,573
I was looking for Paige.
I was worried about her.

647
00:55:07,732 --> 00:55:09,889
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

648
00:55:10,034 --> 00:55:12,389
I wonder if wasn't you
chasing us back there.

649
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:13,955
What ?

650
00:55:14,357 --> 00:55:17,200
Maybe you trying to scare...
Get her to move back in.

651
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:19,280
Your charm sure isn't gonna do it.

652
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:22,876
Stop it!
Both of you.

653
00:55:22,877 --> 00:55:25,205
- You're very brave with that gun.
- Then you want me to get rid of it?

654
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:29,117
- Yeah!  Give it to me!
- Shut up!  Just shut the fuck up!

655
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:33,299
Come on.
I'm taking you home.

656
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:40,028
Are you asking me or telling me?

657
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:48,372
I'm asking you.
Please...

658
00:55:58,296 --> 00:56:00,228
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

659
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,227
What's happening to you, Paige?

660
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:30,094
What do you mean?

661
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:33,256
Now look at the way you're dressed...

662
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,464
- What about it?
- Baby, that's not you.

663
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:44,476
Same as the first time I've
ever heard you swear, ever.

664
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,481
Since when did you notice
anything I said ...?

665
00:56:48,082 --> 00:56:50,900
Or wanted, or cared about?

666
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:52,768
I noticed...

667
00:56:53,968 --> 00:56:55,693
I'm not an idiot, Paige.

668
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:58,164
I knew you were unhappy, I just ...

669
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,394
I don't know, I was
afraid to mention it to you

670
00:57:01,395 --> 00:57:03,445
because I thought you would leave.

671
00:57:04,498 --> 00:57:06,028
But I left you anyway.

672
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,304
Well, I didn't say it was a good plan.

673
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:15,587
It really hurt me when you left.

674
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:18,278
And you know how I get when I'm hurt.

675
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:21,003
I'm angry and nasty...

676
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,663
It doesn't mean that
I don't care about you.

677
00:57:25,164 --> 00:57:26,566
I know.

678
00:57:27,066 --> 00:57:28,887
I want you to move back in.

679
00:57:31,997 --> 00:57:35,109
- I can't.
- Why not?

680
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,096
This Russell character, I
suppose he's the sensitive type.

681
00:57:40,097 --> 00:57:45,731
- Knows exactly what you need?
- I don't even know exactly what I need.

682
00:59:15,017 --> 00:59:18,386
PANPIPES
MAGICKAL MARKETPLACE

683
00:59:19,513 --> 00:59:21,855
I know what you're thinking.

684
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,595
You've never seen
a Jewish occultist before.

685
00:59:25,031 --> 00:59:27,374
Not to worry, I'm not orthodox.

686
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:30,351
First thing you gotta understand,

687
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:35,762
is that spirits are all
around us all... the time.

688
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,438
But they can't reach us
without some kind of help.

689
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:40,864
Like the Ouija board!

690
00:59:40,898 --> 00:59:42,265
Correct!

691
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,459
When you use the Ouija...

692
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,089
you open the door...

693
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:47,657
and the spirits...

694
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:50,120
can step through.

695
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:52,742
So that's how she was
able to break my mirror?

696
00:59:52,743 --> 00:59:54,503
Because we were using the Ouija.

697
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:55,803
Right!

698
00:59:56,004 --> 00:59:58,093
No Ouija, no broken glass.

699
00:59:58,264 --> 00:59:59,859
Couldn't that be dangerous?

700
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,162
Sure.

701
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:03,922
You get an evil spirit...

702
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,581
You could have furniture and
silverware flying all over the place.

703
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,037
This spirit of yours,
she was murdered.

704
01:00:14,538 --> 01:00:16,518
Yes... How...?
How did you know that?

705
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:19,627
They all say that.

706
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:22,286
Being dead must be really dull.

707
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:25,314
Because they love to "talk" to us.

708
01:00:25,342 --> 01:00:27,101
But they know we won't talk to them

709
01:00:27,102 --> 01:00:30,204
if they're some boring
schmuck who died of old age.

710
01:00:30,553 --> 01:00:33,100
So they say they were murdered.

711
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:37,149
I guess even in the spirit world,
sex and violence sells.

712
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,776
So what are you saying?
All spirits are liars.

713
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:43,611
To a degree, yeah.

714
01:00:43,646 --> 01:00:47,411
- What's a a rifle cape?
- You got me.

715
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,831
It isn't some spiritual
term of some kind?

716
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:52,792
Not that I know of.

717
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,437
Are you sure she didn't misspell it?

718
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:59,189
- Is that possible?
- Are you kidding?

719
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,104
Spirits are terrible spellers.

720
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:04,781
Their communication skills in
general leave a lot to be desired.

721
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:06,696
Look...

722
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:09,887
assuming that all this stuff

723
01:01:09,971 --> 01:01:14,113
isn't just a bunch of "mumbo jumbo".

724
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:18,872
How can we be sure this
spirit really is who it says it is?

725
01:01:19,322 --> 01:01:20,672
You're not sure?

726
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,666
- Did you know her when she was alive?
- I did.

727
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:30,899
I got just the thing ... for you.

728
01:01:31,075 --> 01:01:36,621
- What is it?
- An automatic writer.

729
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,657
You use it just like
a regular planchet.

730
01:01:41,023 --> 01:01:45,117
You put it on a sketch pad
instead of a Ouija board.

731
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:50,380
And ... you stick
a pen ... in this hole.

732
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:56,673
Then this, Susan of yours will actually
have to write out her messages.

733
01:01:56,851 --> 01:01:58,724
Well, what good is that?

734
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:01,794
If it's really her, it will be
her handwriting, not yours.

735
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:04,476
That's incredible!

736
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:07,465
When did they come up with this?

737
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:11,000
What's today?  The fifth.
About two thousand years ago.

738
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:17,168
They actually predate Ouija boards
been around since at least 540 BC.

739
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:20,572
Which makes them only slightly
older than my mother-in-law.

740
01:02:21,297 --> 01:02:26,342
You got any other questions ...
Read this.

741
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:30,864
The Complete History Of
OUIJA

742
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:36,253
So, as soon as we get back, see if
find a sample of Susan's handwriting.

743
01:02:37,177 --> 01:02:38,738
Can't wait to use this.

744
01:02:38,897 --> 01:02:42,146
Maybe you should read the book first.
Find out what you're doing.

745
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,835
You read the book.
I know what I'm doing.

746
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:47,755
What's the big hurry?

747
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,130
Why can't you wait one lousy day?

748
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:52,700
- What for?
- What for?

749
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,757
Paige, look at yourself.
You're obsessed with that Ouija board.

750
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:59,250
Russell, why do you even care?
You don't even believe in it.

751
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:00,416
No, I don't.

752
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,023
You were there, Russell.

753
01:03:03,058 --> 01:03:06,029
You saw the pointer move
with your own eyes.

754
01:03:06,704 --> 01:03:12,158
It was your subconscious,
or Elaine's or maybe even mine.

755
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:15,151
So who's subconscious
shattered the mirror?

756
01:03:15,427 --> 01:03:16,720
I don't know.

757
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:19,436
But there's a logical
explanation somewhere.

758
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:20,779
Yes!

759
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,936
Susan Sidney is dead and
she wants me to find her body.

760
01:03:35,985 --> 01:03:42,500
Promise me, you won't use the Ouija or
the writer till I read this book, okay?

761
01:03:42,712 --> 01:03:45,564
Okay, Mom, I promise.

762
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,001
CAR  FILE

763
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:25,364
FIRE  PLACE

764
01:06:35,668 --> 01:06:36,811
Hello?

765
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:38,783
Paige, it's Mitch.

766
01:06:39,114 --> 01:06:41,653
Listen, I think I found
your friend Susan Sidney.

767
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,478
You're kidding?
Where?

768
01:06:43,568 --> 01:06:45,671
Well, it seems a couple
of years ago, Parks Woods

769
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:48,594
was going to be
developed into tract homes.

770
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:52,137
The plans fell through but not before
they subdivided the land into lots.

771
01:06:52,138 --> 01:06:54,841
And one of the lots is number 217.

772
01:06:55,298 --> 01:06:57,060
Mitch, that's great!

773
01:06:57,363 --> 01:06:59,160
Yeah... Well, I'm going to
head up to it right now.

774
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:01,452
- Okay yeah.  I'll meet you there.
- No!

775
01:07:01,491 --> 01:07:04,001
Listen.  It's police business.
If there is a body out there

776
01:07:04,002 --> 01:07:06,425
you're out of it, as of now.
You got it?

777
01:07:07,796 --> 01:07:09,920
- Wait, I was the one who...
- No!

778
01:07:09,921 --> 01:07:12,805
No "buts", Paige.
And I mean it, okay?

779
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:17,401
Okay, but you call me as
soon as you find something.

780
01:07:17,436 --> 01:07:19,380
I will.
Goodbye.

781
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:35,681
Susan?

782
01:07:36,483 --> 01:07:37,982
Susan are you here?

783
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:42,184
Susan...?

784
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,415
Susan, I have good news.

785
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:54,833
Mitch found your body.
He's driving out there right now.

786
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,470
Stop.

787
01:08:04,974 --> 01:08:06,238
Stop?

788
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:08,736
Isn't that what you want?

789
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:10,869
Susan!

790
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,673
Susan!
What do you want?

791
01:12:08,674 --> 01:12:10,665
Paige...
Paige!

792
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,431
Snap out of it!

793
01:12:17,932 --> 01:12:19,497
What happened?

794
01:12:21,698 --> 01:12:25,222
You had to use it, didn't you!
You just couldn't wait.

795
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:28,880
Please, no lectures.

796
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:32,578
- Still feeling a little faint?
- It's nothing.

797
01:12:32,911 --> 01:12:35,037
No, it's not.

798
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:38,788
I've been reading this book on Ouija's
and it scared the hell out of me.

799
01:12:39,296 --> 01:12:41,190
Do you know what
they used to be called?

800
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:42,924
Before this century...?

801
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,289
"Witch boards".

802
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,650
Yeah.

803
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,782
Witches used them to contact demons.

804
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:50,181
Remember when I said
you were obsessed.

805
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:51,916
Well, I was right.

806
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:55,000
According to this book,
when you use the Ouija alone

807
01:12:55,012 --> 01:12:58,915
like you've been doing, you're very
susceptible to the spirit you contact.

808
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:02,154
At first they'll be
helpful and friendly

809
01:13:02,155 --> 01:13:05,138
so it can get you to use
the board over and over.

810
01:13:06,609 --> 01:13:10,082
And each time you do, he gets
stronger and you get weaker.

811
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:13,050
Soon you're so weak, you have to
use it whether you want to or not.

812
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,850
What are you telling me?
I'm a Ouija junkie?

813
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:17,381
It's no joke, Paige!

814
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:20,397
It's called "progressive
entrapment" and it gets worse.

815
01:13:20,599 --> 01:13:23,055
After you're addicted,
the spirit changes.

816
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:25,872
He starts to threaten
and terrorize you

817
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:29,554
breaking down your
resistance like brainwashing.

818
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:32,490
So eventually it can possess you.

819
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:35,219
Why would Susan want to possess me?

820
01:13:35,254 --> 01:13:36,445
It's not Susan!

821
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,847
Yes, it is!

822
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,147
Look...

823
01:13:40,914 --> 01:13:43,351
She lost this when she was killed.

824
01:13:43,742 --> 01:13:45,760
This could be anybody's.

825
01:13:45,795 --> 01:13:47,067
It's Susan's!

826
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:48,934
Oh, yeah?

827
01:13:49,035 --> 01:13:50,899
Here, take a look at this.

828
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:52,532
What is it?

829
01:13:52,701 --> 01:13:54,230
Susan's lease agreement.

830
01:13:54,332 --> 01:13:57,115
Compare the "S"s in her
signature to the "S" in STOP.

831
01:14:03,851 --> 01:14:05,015
It doesn't match!

832
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:07,110
No!  It doesn't!

833
01:14:07,713 --> 01:14:09,307
Well, then who the fuck is it?

834
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:11,014
It doesn't matter who it is!

835
01:14:11,049 --> 01:14:13,109
Well, what it is, you have
to stop using the Ouija

836
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:15,281
and the automatic writer right now!

837
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:19,601
Russel, I'm not falling
into progressive entrapment.

838
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:21,573
Oh, no?  Here...

839
01:14:21,774 --> 01:14:23,930
Let me read you some of the symptoms.

840
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:27,554
Fainting spells, aggression,

841
01:14:27,933 --> 01:14:30,156
excessive use of profanity,

842
01:14:30,692 --> 01:14:34,171
overtly sexual,
provocative behaviour.

843
01:14:36,645 --> 01:14:38,505
Sound like anyone you know?

844
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:40,700
Russell, what am I going to do?

845
01:14:42,803 --> 01:14:44,413
I'm glad you asked.

846
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:51,381
Here, take these and toss
them into the dumpster.

847
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:54,604
- Should I take the earring too?
- No!  All on to it.

848
01:14:55,476 --> 01:14:57,996
Good night, Paige.
I'll call you tomorrow.

849
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,899
Hello?

850
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,674
<i>Hi Paige?  I'm Officer Rogers.
I hope you remember me...</i>

851
01:16:39,768 --> 01:16:41,594
I remember you.
Mitch's friend, right?

852
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:43,453
<i>Right.
Mitch has been in an accident.</i>

853
01:16:43,454 --> 01:16:44,455
What?

854
01:16:44,657 --> 01:16:45,657
Where?

855
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:46,987
<i>Ah, in the County Hospital.</i>

856
01:16:47,287 --> 01:16:49,250
Yeah... yeah...
Thanks.  Okay.

857
01:18:03,153 --> 01:18:06,470
- Russel?
- Elaine!

858
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:10,820
- Something wrong?
- You tell me.

859
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,486
What do you mean?

860
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:16,140
You forged that lease
agreement you showed to Paige.

861
01:18:16,878 --> 01:18:18,543
What are you talking about?

862
01:18:20,045 --> 01:18:22,080
I found the real one.

863
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:24,077
Look.

864
01:18:24,378 --> 01:18:26,502
The "S"s all match perfectly.

865
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:31,123
It really is Susan's spirit, isn't it?

866
01:18:31,424 --> 01:18:32,792
I think so.

867
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:36,238
And I think she
caused Jonas's accident.

868
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:43,944
Elaine!
Wait!

869
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,213
All right you bitch!

870
01:19:09,548 --> 01:19:11,378
I know you're not Susan.

871
01:19:11,715 --> 01:19:13,941
So what the hell do you want from me?

872
01:19:15,276 --> 01:19:16,904
I know you're here!

873
01:19:20,106 --> 01:19:21,835
What do you want from me?

874
01:19:24,437 --> 01:19:26,332
Answer me, God damn it!

875
01:19:27,534 --> 01:19:29,099
What do you want?

876
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,756
Russel, I don't want
to talk about it ...

877
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:08,245
Just leave me alone!
Go home!

878
01:21:27,655 --> 01:21:29,056
Come on!

879
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,540
Official Mitchell!
What are you doing out of bed?

880
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:37,748
Going checking out.

881
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:40,239
But Dr. Gillano hasn't released you.

882
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:18,109
Russel?

883
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:32,875
Russel!

884
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,343
Russel...?

885
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:43,143
Paige!

886
01:24:00,445 --> 01:24:01,544
Listen.

887
01:24:01,845 --> 01:24:03,770
We need to go back Park Woods.

888
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:07,004
I know where Susan is buried
and I know how she died.

889
01:24:07,864 --> 01:24:09,258
The only thing I don't know

890
01:24:09,259 --> 01:24:10,948
is why she said the
woods were uptown

891
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:12,982
when they were actually
up by the interstate.

892
01:24:13,346 --> 01:24:16,203
I thought you were going
to stop using the Ouija.

893
01:24:16,305 --> 01:24:17,835
I don't think I can.

894
01:24:18,336 --> 01:24:21,470
You were right.  I've fallen
into progressive entrapment.

895
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:24,617
God damn it!
Why don't you just leave it alone!

896
01:24:27,054 --> 01:24:29,993
Russel.
What's the matter with you?

897
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:31,821
Why are you so angry?

898
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,739
Oh my God!

899
01:24:50,906 --> 01:24:53,132
She wasn't saying "uptown".

900
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:57,194
She misspelt Upton.

901
01:25:01,793 --> 01:25:04,941
You said you inherited property.

902
01:25:05,774 --> 01:25:07,239
Park Woods?

903
01:25:09,442 --> 01:25:11,205
You murdered Susan!

904
01:25:15,905 --> 01:25:17,005
Paige!

905
01:25:17,006 --> 01:25:18,208
Stay away from me!

906
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:19,730
Let me explain...

907
01:25:25,474 --> 01:25:26,675
Paige...

908
01:25:27,275 --> 01:25:29,896
Open the door, and let me
tell you what happened!

909
01:25:33,577 --> 01:25:34,841
Susan!

910
01:25:35,775 --> 01:25:37,636
Susan, I need your help!

911
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:40,293
No!
Don't use the Ouija!

912
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,725
Paige!

913
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:56,690
Susan, please!

914
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,524
Hold it!

915
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:06,124
I got you!

916
01:26:08,461 --> 01:26:09,826
Scumbag...

917
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:17,057
Drop the pick axe.

918
01:26:22,259 --> 01:26:23,458
We have to stop her.

919
01:26:23,894 --> 01:26:26,004
Like you stop Susan Sidney?

920
01:26:26,888 --> 01:26:29,610
I didn't kill Susan!
Elaine did!

921
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:31,780
She must have found out
about her affair with Jonas.

922
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:33,647
Yeah, right.

923
01:26:35,882 --> 01:26:38,337
You just helped her hide
the body, didn't you?

924
01:26:38,538 --> 01:26:39,968
No!  That was Jonas!

925
01:26:40,304 --> 01:26:44,775
I didn't know anything about it!
I really thought Susan moved.

926
01:26:45,392 --> 01:26:46,864
I'm sure you did.

927
01:26:46,964 --> 01:26:51,651
Paige!  Come on out here, babe.
Everything's under control!

928
01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:54,516
Listen to me...

929
01:26:54,817 --> 01:26:58,453
Susan came back for revenge...
To kill Jonas and Elaine.

930
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:00,431
But now I think she wants more.

931
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:01,890
She wants her life back!

932
01:27:01,891 --> 01:27:04,484
And she's going to possess
Paige unless we stop her.

933
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:06,922
What ...?
Possess Paige?

934
01:27:07,177 --> 01:27:09,336
What the hell are you
talking about, man?

935
01:27:12,039 --> 01:27:13,338
Paige!

936
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:42,140
Who the hell are you?

937
01:28:08,441 --> 01:28:09,742
Official Mitchell...

938
01:28:10,443 --> 01:28:12,731
So nice of you to drop by.

939
01:29:07,135 --> 01:29:08,896
What's with the gun, Russel?

940
01:29:09,898 --> 01:29:11,826
Aren't you happy to see me.

941
01:29:16,027 --> 01:29:17,759
You can't kill me...

942
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:22,089
I'm already dead.

943
01:29:37,525 --> 01:29:38,988
Look, Russell...

944
01:29:40,659 --> 01:29:42,289
I have nothing against you.

945
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:46,093
After all, Elaine was
the one who killed me.

946
01:29:46,484 --> 01:29:49,207
Just let me walk out of here...
and we'll call it even.

947
01:29:50,206 --> 01:29:52,843
I can't.
I can't do that.

948
01:29:53,275 --> 01:29:54,904
You don't have a choice.

949
01:29:54,906 --> 01:29:57,366
You shoot me, you shoot Paige.

950
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,011
And it would be a
shame to put a hole

951
01:30:01,012 --> 01:30:03,625
in such a nice body
when I just got it.

952
01:30:05,946 --> 01:30:07,971
It is a nice body, isn't it?

953
01:30:09,513 --> 01:30:12,258
Not as nice as mine,
but then I was a dancer.

954
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:16,071
You were a bitch!
And you still are.

955
01:30:16,274 --> 01:30:20,214
But you wanted me
anyways, didn't you?

956
01:30:20,868 --> 01:30:22,838
And you wanted Paige...

957
01:30:24,164 --> 01:30:25,858
Put the gun down, Russell!

958
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:29,654
And you can have us
both at the same time.

959
01:30:33,382 --> 01:30:34,722
Come on, Russell!

960
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,434
It's not everyday you get
a chance to fuck a ghost.

961
01:30:38,669 --> 01:30:40,960
Stay back!
I mean it...

962
01:31:25,662 --> 01:31:30,273
Let her go ... Susan!
She's innocent...

963
01:31:33,882 --> 01:31:39,359
Nobody's innocent!
And I want my life back!

964
01:32:07,996 --> 01:32:09,262
Paige!

965
01:32:37,598 --> 01:32:39,395
Evening, officer Mitchell...

966
01:32:40,994 --> 01:32:42,104
Where is she?

967
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:44,156
You tell me where
she is, where's Paige.

968
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:46,633
Tell me where she is,
you little bitch!

969
01:32:48,018 --> 01:32:49,647
Where is she?

970
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:53,144
Right here, officer Mitchell...

971
01:32:54,045 --> 01:32:55,246
Mitch...

972
01:32:55,546 --> 01:32:57,012
Help me, please!

973
01:32:59,012 --> 01:33:00,212
Paige...?

974
01:33:17,714 --> 01:33:19,739
Seven years bad luck!

975
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:29,740
Please!

976
01:33:31,073 --> 01:33:32,406
Whoever you are...

977
01:33:34,907 --> 01:33:36,473
Let Paige go...

978
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:40,000
Actually, I'm doing her a favor...

979
01:33:41,236 --> 01:33:43,261
She was always afraid of life.

980
01:33:45,096 --> 01:33:47,981
Now she doesn't have
to be afraid anymore.

981
01:33:51,681 --> 01:33:53,111
Paige!
Don't!

982
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:56,144
You can fight her!

983
01:33:56,446 --> 01:33:58,142
I know you can stop her!

984
01:33:58,376 --> 01:33:59,841
I know you can!...

985
01:34:00,744 --> 01:34:03,041
You fight her, Paige!
You fight her!

986
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,536
That's it!
Fight her!

987
01:35:03,138 --> 01:35:05,494
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts about moving.

988
01:35:06,095 --> 01:35:07,295
No.

989
01:35:08,194 --> 01:35:12,195
Now that found Susan's body has
finally been found and laid to rest...

990
01:35:12,224 --> 01:35:14,183
I'm ready to move on with my life.

991
01:35:14,484 --> 01:35:16,775
And I'm definitely going to
go to art school this time ...

992
01:35:16,776 --> 01:35:18,405
and nothing is going to stop me.

993
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,095
So, can I call you
once you're settled in?

994
01:35:21,795 --> 01:35:24,077
I'll be insulted if you didn't.

995
01:35:24,699 --> 01:35:27,217
You should know by now,
I'm not so easy to get rid off.

996
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:30,643
Who says I want to get rid of you?

997
01:35:42,146 --> 01:35:44,504
Chuck, you and Linda
finally have that baby, huh?

998
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:46,846
Yeah.
A boy.  Named him Brandon.

999
01:35:46,899 --> 01:35:48,598
Yeah alright Chip.

1000
01:35:51,301 --> 01:35:53,900
- Hey!  Look at this!
- What?

1001
01:35:54,132 --> 01:35:55,960
Well, it looks like one of those...

1002
01:35:55,963 --> 01:35:58,189
You know, the pointer
things, to a Ouija board.

1003
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,616
Oh man, those things
give me the creeps.

1004
01:36:00,852 --> 01:36:02,713
Look, this one's got a pen in it.

1005
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,423
Huh, you can actually write with it.

1006
01:36:04,847 --> 01:36:06,276
Mike, come on!
Put it back!

1007
01:36:06,277 --> 01:36:07,426
We got to go.

1008
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,955
You don't think these
things really work, do you?

1009
01:36:16,057 --> 01:36:18,388
YES.
