1
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,622
<i>My father used to say, "Life is a road,</i>

2
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,799
<i>"and every day is a mile marker.</i>

3
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,536
<i>"If you don't slow down occasionally,</i>
<i>you'll miss what each mile has to offer."</i>

4
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,603
<i>But there's also a flip side to that.</i>

5
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,939
<i>Sometimes you can take a wrong turn</i>

6
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:33,007
<i>and find yourself on the most God-awful</i>
<i>stretch of road imaginable,</i>

7
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,751
<i>spinning your wheels,</i>

8
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,851
<i>praying it's not a dead end.</i>

9
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,765
How you doing back there, Joshua?

10
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,536
I'm in too much pain to be dead.

11
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,767
- How you hanging in there, boss?
- I'm all right.

12
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,274
I've lost more blood from a bad shave.

13
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,654
Damn. I think one of my lungs
just collapsed.

14
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,851
That's all right. You only need one.

15
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,496
My old man lost a lung to Joe Camel
when he was 53 years old,

16
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,432
and he lived to be 67.

17
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,032
Still running a pack a day
through the other lung.

18
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:30,002
Of course, out of spite,
he switched to Marlboro.

19
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,873
I'm dying, Vincent.

20
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,004
Hey! That is bullshit. I don't let you die.

21
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,742
I told you I was leaving.

22
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,845
All right, you gotta stay with me.

23
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,389
We're half an hour
from the doc's house.

24
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,857
I'll have us there in 20 minutes.

25
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,556
<i>Love, honor, power,</i>

26
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,422
<i>fear of death,</i>

27
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:01,004
<i>people live for all kinds of reasons.</i>
<i>Some are more noble than others.</i>

28
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,340
<i>When all you have to live for is revenge,</i>

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,010
<i>it can really bone your quality of life.</i>

30
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,016
Come on in, Donnie.

31
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,920
I don't see
why we have to talk in the garage

32
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,221
when I've got a perfectly nice house.
Why don't I...

33
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,760
Get in there!

34
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,691
Donnie. Stop being such a pussy, huh?

35
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,665
- Hey, Mickey.
- What?

36
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,430
Try to maintain
some level of professionalism.

37
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,028
- What are you talking about?
- The pushing, the name-calling,

38
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,439
- it's not necessary.
- Hey, I'm sorry, Donnie.

39
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,437
See, I thought that we work
for this big crime boss

40
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,638
and we're here
to collect some money for him,

41
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,704
but obviously
we're a couple of Avon ladies.

42
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,876
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Not everything's black and white.

43
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,149
- I mean, Donnie here's a good guy.
- Get over there.

44
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,815
But this isn't a social call, is it, Donnie?

45
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,020
This is business.
This is nothing personal.

46
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,232
We're here to collect the money
or impose a penalty.

47
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,326
There's no need to add insult to injury,
now, is there?

48
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,392
No.

49
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,031
Joshua, what kind of injury
are we talking about?

50
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,034
So you don't have Vincent's money.

51
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,307
- Well, not all of it.
- Well, how much do you have?

52
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,447
None of it.

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,179
Donnie.

54
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,686
You put me in a very bad place.

55
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,262
Please, have a seat.

56
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,972
- You don't have to do this.
- It's for your own safety.

57
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,633
- What?
- Hold him.

58
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,401
No!

59
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,581
Come on, Joshua.
Can't you tell Vincent I wasn't home?

60
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:59,022
Tell him I'm out of town on business
or something.

61
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,655
You want me to lie to Vincent?

62
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,762
Betray his trust because
you can't stay away from the ponies?

63
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,197
I can have the dough next week!

64
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,367
Vincent's been more than patient
with you.

65
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:17,237
- Now he wants his pound of flesh.
- Hey! Maybe we take his thumbs off.

66
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,277
No, nothing permanent.

67
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,143
What are you talking about?
They can reattach them these days.

68
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,682
Hey, I think I found something.

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,117
How about we give him
a little snip-snip Bobbitt?

70
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:33,021
Yeah, then there'd be two loose pricks
in the room.

71
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,924
- That's funny?
- A little bit.

72
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,263
I've got a joke for you,
and it starts like this.

73
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:51,371
That's enough, Mickey.
Grab that stool and prop his legs up.

74
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,604
- What?
- Take his shoes off.

75
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,047
- Get your fucking feet up.
- The socks, too.

76
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,449
Get your feet up here, you fuck.

77
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,011
- Why? Don't! Why?
- Shut the fuck up!

78
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,218
- Grab his legs.
- What? Why?

79
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,420
Joshua. Please.

80
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,933
No! Please! Joshua, please, no!

81
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,300
Don't you find it ironic, Mickey,

82
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,107
that the black culture has become
so influential in this country

83
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,512
that even the Italians
are trying to identify with it?

84
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,915
What the fuck are you talking about?

85
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,681
If your grandfather knew
that you had a lifetime membership

86
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,085
to the tanning salon...

87
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,987
Tanning salon?
You're out of your fucking mind.

88
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,458
This is natural. This is my natural color.

89
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,893
Orange.
That's your natural color, orange?

90
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,659
Orange? Do I look orange to you?
This is olive.

91
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,065
- Which one? The green or the black?
- The green and the black.

92
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,126
- <i>Who is it?</i>
- It's Joshua.

93
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,899
- <i>Password, please.</i>
- You're a douche! That's the password.

94
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,868
Hey, why the fuck do you...

95
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,409
<i>Come on! Who is it?</i>

96
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,282
- Jeff, it's me, Joshua.
- <i>Bullshit. Joshua knows the password.</i>

97
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,848
Majestic 12, Jeff.

98
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,757
"Majestic 12, Majestic 12."
What a fucking snatch.

99
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,324
What the fuck is Majestic 12?

100
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,399
It's a secret committee
formed in the '40s to investigate UFOs.

101
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:01,305
- You believe that shit?
- There are two kinds of truths, Mickey.

102
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,839
There's the obvious truth.
The sky is blue.

103
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:10,344
The grass is green. You're a dick.
And then there's the intangible.

104
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,309
The kind that requires one's faith
to be true.

105
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,885
Can't be conclusively proven or refuted.

106
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,995
This is the truth of religion
and conspiracy theories.

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,902
My faith in God mandates
that I stay open-minded to all truths.

108
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,969
Otherwise I risk becoming a hypocrite,
and that ain't cool.

109
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,320
Hey. Come in.

110
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,452
- How you doing, buddy?
- Okay.

111
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,394
- Wow. New wallpaper?
- It's aluminum foil.

112
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,396
It's nice. I gotta get the number
of your interior decorator.

113
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:07,337
Can I get you guys something to drink?
I have triple-filtered water, no fluoride.

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,606
Triple-filtered water, huh? Nah.

115
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,038
What was it about Vincent
you wanted to tell me?

116
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,678
You've heard of Frankie Tahoe, right?

117
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,713
- Why don't you tell me about him?
- Hey, Jeff.

118
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,654
Did you really get abducted by aliens?

119
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,558
- Yeah, I was.
- Wow. That's fucking crazy.

120
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,323
Can you put those down, please?

121
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,829
- These?
- Please.

122
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,558
- Mickey, put them down.
- Okay.

123
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,964
Thank you.

124
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,367
Okay, Frankie Tahoe
is this Puerto Rican small-time punk.

125
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,971
Drug dealer, right?

126
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,769
And he knows
I'm good friends with Vincent.

127
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,072
All of a sudden
he starts asking me all kinds of shit.

128
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,341
"Where does he live?
How many guys he got?" Okay?

129
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,938
But I didn't...

130
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,616
I didn't... I didn't tell him nothing.
I swear to God.

131
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,826
Look what he did to me.

132
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,999
Stop messing with this stuff.

133
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,474
This is cute.

134
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,178
See, now, I'm ignorant
on the whole abduction thing,

135
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,044
you know what I'm saying?
So, is it true that when they bring you up

136
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:28,519
in their spaceship, that they roll around
your fucking prostate and your anal?

137
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,886
- They get in there?
- Yeah, that's part of the exam.

138
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,790
Why the fuck would they put it
in your ass? I don't understand.

139
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,556
There's things they want to find out
about us human beings, you know.

140
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,997
- Through your ass?
- Yeah. Body temperature, you know?

141
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,564
Parasites.

142
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,671
I know, I know.
But I'm gonna be there this time.

143
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:50,335
I will.

144
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,968
Okay. Okay.

145
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,552
You know what I think?

146
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,217
I think that all the aliens
must be fucking gay

147
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,693
and they just want to shove it right
in your corn, you know what I mean?

148
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,195
They just want to come down here
and abuse humans

149
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,960
and fucking give it to you
right in your ass. Is that true?

150
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,733
Do you refuse to believe 'cause
you believe this to be impossible?

151
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,070
Or maybe it's just impossible
for your limited wit to comprehend.

152
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,773
Excuse me.

153
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,572
You know, that's a good point.
You know, my limited wit might...

154
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:34,085
Might stop me from believing that aliens
don't fuck you in your fucking ass!

155
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,621
- Now listen to me. Listen to me!
- Get off of me.

156
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,455
- Look at me, look at me!
- Joshua!

157
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,618
- Get off my...
- Fuck!

158
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,855
Put your fucking arms down.
Put your fucking arms down, now!

159
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,829
- Okay, okay. They're down.
- Okay, thank you.

160
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,889
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you go to Vincent directly?

161
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,164
- Why come to me?
- 'Cause you know how he would get

162
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,633
if he saw what they did to me.

163
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,566
You're his main guy, right?

164
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,835
Do what you gotta do
to this lying piece of shit.

165
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,076
Wait! Wait. Okay. Wait. Stop! Joshua!

166
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,482
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Stop, stop. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

167
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,883
- Okay, see?
- Okay, okay.

168
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,253
Joshua, all I was trying to do
is make a few bucks

169
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,624
selling his stuff, and he starts
talking to me about all this shit!

170
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,868
Just don't tell Vincent, please.
He'll be so fucking mad at me.

171
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,364
I am telling you the truth now.
I swear to God.

172
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,800
- You better be, you fucking junkie.
- Fuck!

173
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,094
- Vincent.
- Come on in.

174
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,939
Sorry to wake you.
I thought it might be important.

175
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,842
Actually, I wasn't sleeping.
I was fucking,

176
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,315
and if you think it's important
then it probably is.

177
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,343
Joshua, I want to thank you
for having the good sense and courtesy

178
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,916
to remove your shoes, so as not
to track in the filth of the outside world.

179
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,188
Take your shoes off, Mickey.

180
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,358
Shit, I'm sorry.

181
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,539
The good news is,
I didn't track anything in.

182
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,503
Can you detect things that exist
on a microscopic level?

183
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,445
In the future,
when you come to my home,

184
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,982
I want you to take off your shoes.

185
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,708
I don't want to tell you again,
'cause if I do,

186
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,845
you won't need shoes anyway,
'cause I'll cut off your fucking feet.

187
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,890
- Got it, Vince.
- Vincent.

188
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,787
Say my whole name
or don't say it at all, please.

189
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,521
Yes, sir, Vincent.

190
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,021
Let's sit down, shall we?

191
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,300
Well?

192
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,844
Apparently, a cat by the name
of Frankie Tahoe wants you dead.

193
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,648
That's not exactly what you want to hear
at 1:00 in the morning.

194
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,514
Is there any time of day
you want to hear that shit?

195
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,612
Who the fuck is Frankie Tahoe,
and where'd you hear this?

196
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,284
He's a Puerto Rican drug dealer.
Jeff told me.

197
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,021
Why didn't Jeff call me himself?

198
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,087
- Vincent?
- Yeah, baby.

199
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,861
- Did you offer the boys any coffee?
- No.

200
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,460
- Why not?
- 'Cause they don't want any.

201
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,000
Well, how do you know that
if you didn't offer?

202
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,507
Because when they're working for me
I make decisions for them,

203
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,668
and I've decided
they don't want any fucking coffee.

204
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,372
Jesus Christ, you are the worst host.

205
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,109
- Would you please watch your mouth?
- Look who's talking.

206
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,981
Do not take the name of my savior
in vain.

207
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,280
You know, you wouldn't even offer him
a cup of coffee.

208
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,344
He doesn't drink coffee.

209
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,913
Would you please do me a favor
and go back to bed?

210
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,891
I'll be up in a minute.

211
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,984
Go back to bed.

212
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,536
Like what you're seeing, Mick?

213
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,535
What?

214
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,512
Come on. There's a...
I mean, she's beautiful, but...

215
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,345
- I would never do that.
- Go wait outside.

216
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,314
- It's fucking freezing outside.
- Get the fuck out of here.

217
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,358
So, Jeff's been selling this dude's dope
on the side.

218
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,699
Okay, that's why he didn't call me.
What do you make of it?

219
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,997
It's not the first drug dealer
that wanted you dead.

220
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,907
- Yeah.
- But I don't know that I trust Jeff.

221
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,541
He's from my old neighborhood.
I trust him.

222
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,947
- Guy thinks he was abducted by aliens...
- I know, I know.

223
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,343
All right, here's what I want you to do.

224
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,356
Find out exactly
where this guy is right now.

225
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,249
I'm gonna go get dressed.

226
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,297
Hey, Vincent? There is one other thing.

227
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,523
What is it? What's the problem?
You need money? What is it?

228
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,161
- No, no. It's not that.
- Where do you think you're going?

229
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,603
I'm going to Disneyland.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

230
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,264
Isn't that when everybody
goes to Disneyland?

231
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,241
- Give me a fucking break.
- What a smartass.

232
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,334
And you know what?
I don't like you talking to me like that.

233
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,176
All right, all right, all right.
We'll talk about it later.

234
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,632
Hey.

235
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:04,439
- Jeffrey, how's things?
- They're fine. They're great, Vincent.

236
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,817
- So, how's Katie?
- What?

237
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,081
- Katie? How is she?
- She's good, yeah.

238
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,487
She's starting high school soon.

239
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,553
We're gonna take care of her,
you know that, right?

240
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,619
- You get enough visitation?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,765
So, Jeff, tell me about this Puerto Rican.

242
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,801
Frankie. Yeah, Frankie Tahoe.

243
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,237
You in trouble with this guy
or something?

244
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,667
Why?

245
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,978
Look at me.

246
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,283
I need to be 100% sure that what
you're telling me is on the level.

247
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,788
Yeah, Vincent. I wouldn't lie to you.
You know that.

248
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,855
- He do this to your face?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,724
- I wouldn't tell him nothing.
- Okay.

250
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,730
No, Vincent. No.

251
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,629
You don't have to sell dope
for these scumbags.

252
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,998
You need money, you come to me.

253
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,427
I know. I know.

254
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,300
Thanks, Vincent. Sorry, Vincent.

255
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,105
Jeffrey.

256
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,809
This is fucking unbelievable.
This fucking guy.

257
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,441
Fucking respects him
more than he respects me.

258
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:17,012
- This guy's a fucking lowlife junkie.
- He's got history with this cat.

259
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,256
- Come here!
- Fuck!

260
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,457
Shit.

261
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,670
- Where's your piece?
- Easy.

262
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,308
It's cute.
My grandmother's got one just like it.

263
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,144
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,047
- You know why I'm here?
- No.

265
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,755
Interesting.

266
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,026
How long have you worked
for Mr. Tahoe?

267
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,561
A few months.

268
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,458
Now, here's the most
important question.

269
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,557
In that time,
do you think you've developed

270
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,967
a relationship worth dying for?

271
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,228
No. Fuck that.

272
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,740
Good answer.

273
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,070
- Give me your driver's license.
- What?

274
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,907
Fuck.

275
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,149
Easy, big boy. Easy.

276
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:04,427
Looks like
you've lost some weight, Gregory.

277
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,362
Yeah, I've been cutting back
on the carbs.

278
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,049
What the fuck, man?

279
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,217
- Put your hands behind your back, B.
- For your own safety.

280
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,225
- Okay, well, in that case, all right.
- Yeah, good.

281
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,456
Yeah, I'll play with you guys
for a little while.

282
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,762
- Turn that music down.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,401
Okay, we can talk.
I got a couple questions for you.

284
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,840
That's good, man.

285
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,639
'Cause I got a couple questions for you
my damn self,

286
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,374
you know what I'm saying? First one is,

287
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,915
which one of these two little bitches
right here

288
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,281
gonna give me a lap dance?

289
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,243
Joshua, you wanna give him
a lap dance?

290
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,847
Trip, man. Got chocolate over here.

291
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,352
- How was that?
- Shit.

292
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,127
Fuck. That's not really
what I had in mind, but...

293
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,792
Okay. Okay.

294
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,596
Listen, before we begin,
I want to give you some advice.

295
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,169
When you're dealing with me,
there are two things

296
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:26,335
that will always save your ass.
Honesty and respect.

297
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,504
Now, those are your cigarettes.
You mind if I have one?

298
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,775
Yeah, yeah, go ahead, man.
Help yourself, man.

299
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,840
Why don't we all have one,
you know what I'm saying?

300
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,317
Got a light?

301
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:40,185
You're a good little bitch, huh?
Lighting him up like that.

302
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,152
You know,
I can't smoke in my own home.

303
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,026
My wife won't let me.

304
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,165
She's 110 pounds soaking wet,
but she's got the heart of a drill sergeant

305
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,669
and the mouth of a sailor.
But, fuck, I married her, right?

306
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,297
Do what you do, man,
you know what I'm saying?

307
00:22:56,775 --> 00:23:01,610
I married her, so I have to answer to her.
Everybody's gotta answer to somebody.

308
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,575
I answer to my wife. I answer to God.

309
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,849
Who do you answer to, Franklin?

310
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,748
Well, first of all,
I don't answer to Franklin.

311
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,983
You know what I'm saying?

312
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,391
I didn't like it much
when my mother called me that,

313
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,430
and it sure as hell don't sound
any sweeter coming from your ass.

314
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,331
- Fair enough.
- And the whole married thing,

315
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,761
too much pussy out there in the world,
man, to be married, right, right?

316
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,634
You feel me? And God,

317
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,171
he went right out
the motherfucking door, homie,

318
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,472
once I was old enough
to think for my damn self.

319
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,171
Now, that says a lot about you.

320
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,146
- Is that right?
- Yeah, it does.

321
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,650
You have a problem with authority.
By being an atheist,

322
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,183
you reject the existence
of the ultimate authority.

323
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,619
What the fuck is this? Inquisition?

324
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,415
Now let me tell you something, man,

325
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,825
this is the 20th century, homeboy,
you know that, right?

326
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,865
I stopped believing in fairytales, man,
a long time ago.

327
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,164
God, Santa Claus, all that shit
went out the motherfucking door, man.

328
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,731
Hey, come on, come on, come on, man!

329
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,105
Is this really what you ladies
came down here for?

330
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,507
Is this what you girls
came down here for?

331
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,774
Ask some stupid-ass questions?
I get it, I get it, I get it.

332
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,145
You guys want me to make a donation
to the church, right?

333
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,515
You really think you can kill me,
you piece of shit?

334
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,180
What the fuck you talking about, man?

335
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,917
You slap my people around.
You disrespect my lord and savior.

336
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,621
Hey, hey, my man, is this guy serious?

337
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,494
Hey! Talking to you!

338
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,225
What's this guy talking about, man?

339
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,336
Hey, look, hold on, hold on, let me just...

340
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,637
Let me just think about this
for a quick second, all right?

341
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,370
What the fuck are you talking about,
man? Your people?

342
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,878
What are you... Fuck! God damn...

343
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,977
I've had enough
of your Puerto Rican ass!

344
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,608
That shows how fucking stupid you are,
white boy!

345
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,813
I'm a motherfucking Mexican!

346
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,218
What the fuck is this place?

347
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,467
Who the fuck is that? Is he the cargo?

348
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,238
No, cargo's dead in the trunk.
He's with me.

349
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,835
- Just one?
- Yep.

350
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,742
All right, go straight, to the left.

351
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,907
Fuck this guy, huh?

352
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,921
Fuck. This guy's fucking heavy.

353
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,753
- Straight back. Yeah.
- Right here?

354
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,494
I swear to God, I think he's breathing!

355
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,265
No, I think I'm bugging out.

356
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,280
That was fucking scary.

357
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,950
Fucking goombah zombies,
'cause I hate that shit.

358
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,883
What the... What the fuck?

359
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,424
I'm sorry, Mick.
This thing's got a hair-trigger.

360
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,161
Tell you what,
use these to stop the bleeding.

361
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,928
Some panties.

362
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,095
You should recognize those.
You've been in them enough.

363
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,437
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- This asshole's fucking my wife.

364
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,312
Come on, Vincent.
Do you think I'm stupid?

365
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,007
I think you're stupid enough
to lie to me about it

366
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:41,644
- when you know I know you're lying.
- I'm not lying to you. Joshua, please.

367
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,848
Tell him I'm not lying to him.

368
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,084
I had her followed.
They saw him coming out of my house.

369
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,388
What the fuck were you doing
in my house?

370
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,192
- I wasn't in your house. I swear to God.
- Hope she rocked your world, Mick.

371
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,892
You got me confused with somebody
else, Vincent, I swear to God.

372
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:59,869
Joshua, please. We've been together
the whole time I've been on this crew.

373
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,065
Please tell him I'm not lying.
I swear to God, on my mother's life,

374
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,802
- I swear to God, Vincent.
- Shut up, Mickey.

375
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,104
Vincent?

376
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,344
Vincent! I swear to God,
on my mother's life,

377
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,211
I never fucked your wife! I swear to God.

378
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,519
All right, Mickey. I just had to be sure.

379
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,390
You scared the shit out of me.

380
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,811
Thank you, doll.

381
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:30,088
That's unbelievable.
That looks even worse than it sounded.

382
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,261
It's good for you. You should try it.

383
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,959
You're supposed to enjoy what you eat.
That shit's got no flavor.

384
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,695
It's utility food.

385
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,533
Excuse me, more decaf, please.

386
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,532
Thank you.

387
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,169
You see, that's what I'm talking about.
Decaf. What's the point?

388
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,907
It's like drinking non-alcoholic beer,

389
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,480
getting knobbed from some fat chick,
it's pointless.

390
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,051
You ever had your dick sucked
by a fat chick, Vincent?

391
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,145
No.

392
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,889
Don't knock it till you tried it.

393
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,152
Not only are they extremely
appreciative lovers,

394
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:08,393
but they're incredibly talented
when it comes to oral gratification.

395
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,825
- No shit.
- I shit you not, my friend.

396
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,339
You see, I would... I would
be worried the bitch would get hungry

397
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:18,341
and just start gnawing on the bone,
you know?

398
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,416
I'm leaving, Vincent.

399
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,225
What, are you going on a vacation
or something?

400
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,264
- More like retirement.
- Retirement.

401
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,965
You're gonna retire before me?
With what?

402
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,734
- With who?
- With no one.

403
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,108
Are you starting your own crew?

404
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,441
How long have you been planning this?

405
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,787
- This isn't me anymore.
- All right, listen.

406
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,348
If this is about Mickey,
the guy was fucking my wife, okay?

407
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,054
What am I supposed to do?
What would you do?

408
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,824
- It's not just him.
- Well, then what?

409
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,832
- What about the drug dealer?
- What about him?

410
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,102
Or the way we came down
on that sweatshop three weeks ago.

411
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,262
What about it?

412
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,431
Or that mark you pulled out of the car
on the freeway.

413
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,532
What are you saying to me?

414
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:30,741
I lose it sometimes. What do you want,
an apology? What the fuck do you want?

415
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,529
You all right, Vincent?

416
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,332
No, I'm not all right, Vincent.

417
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,172
Fuck you.

418
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,712
You owe me.

419
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,551
You owe me your life,
and you're out when I say you're out.

420
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,191
I am sick of this shit, Joshua.

421
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,996
- When is it going to end?
- He killed Mickey tonight.

422
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,306
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Thought you were sleeping with him.

423
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,539
Were you?

424
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,574
Fuck you, Joshua.

425
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,922
Wow, really?

426
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,727
Eight points, huh?

427
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,898
That's great, buddy.

428
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,004
And you packed already?

429
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,498
Okay. Me, too.

430
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,434
Vincent. Baby,
I don't want you to go outside.

431
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,377
- I don't want you to go out there.
- What?

432
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,280
Why don't you call Joshua?
Wait for Joshua.

433
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,945
Joshua's down the road, okay?
Joshua's not here anymore.

434
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,184
Joshua's gone.
I'm not gonna call Joshua.

435
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,152
- Listen to me. I'm fine.
- I know.

436
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,923
I'm gonna talk to these guys,
and I'm gonna come right back.

437
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,327
All right?

438
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,280
This coffee sucks. Shit!

439
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,182
- What the hell? What the hell was that?
- Christ almighty!

440
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,685
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

441
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,721
Like I fucking need this...

442
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,184
Hey, Paulie,
there's no one in the fucking car here.

443
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,957
- What?
- There's nobody in the car.

444
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,930
- What are you talking about?
- You all right, fellas?

445
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,526
Yeah, we're fine, pal.
We got it under control. Thank you.

446
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,867
'Cause, you know, I saw the whole thing.
It was clearly the other car's fault.

447
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,136
Hey, pal, I think I already told you,
we have everything under control.

448
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,471
- You got that, right?
- Stephen.

449
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,772
- No, please, Paulie.
- No, no, no, Stephen.

450
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,779
You, please, shut the fuck up.

451
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,372
- What's the matter?
- This is our guy.

452
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,319
This guy? How do you know?

453
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:19,447
He has what appears to be
a very large weapon sticking in my ribs.

454
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,623
Okay. Okay.

455
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,188
Come on.

456
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,127
You know the deal.
We're just the messengers here.

457
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,223
Okay, my doorbell works.

458
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,965
And if it doesn't,
there's a big-ass knocker on the door.

459
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,869
When were you two
gonna deliver the message?

460
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,533
Quite honestly, when our boss called.

461
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,370
How's that for timing?

462
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,003
Hello?

463
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,075
Paulie's busy right now.
Can I take a message?

464
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,446
Yeah, that's me.

465
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,083
No, they were quite obvious.

466
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,017
Okay.

467
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,457
All right, I'll see you soon.

468
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,092
He wants you to take me to the house.
Let's go.

469
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,805
- Vincent?
- No.

470
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,500
Don't worry about it.
Go enjoy your retirement.

471
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:15,441
- Let's go, boys.
- Get in the car, Vincent.

472
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:46,036
This is Nino Bollino's house.

473
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,102
And how do you know that?

474
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,038
- Trust me, I know.
- Interesting.

475
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,945
Come on.

476
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,349
I used to work for his father
back in the day.

477
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,159
He wants to have a little talk.

478
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,403
Welcome to the top of the food chain,
gentlemen.

479
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,438
By the way,
naturally we'll have to pat you down.

480
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,241
Well, you can certainly try.

481
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,751
That's right. Let's have a look at that
gun you stuck in the back of my head.

482
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,219
- Fuck!
- You ever seen a compound fracture?

483
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,257
'Cause if you wanna continue
this little pissing contest,

484
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,555
I could have Joshua
rip this fucker's arm off

485
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,926
- and beat him with it.
- Hey. Just trying to do my job.

486
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,589
I understand,
but we didn't crash this party.

487
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,189
We were invited.

488
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,393
So, if your boss doesn't want us

489
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,436
to exercise
our Second Amendment rights,

490
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,904
we'll just be on our way. Joshua?

491
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,508
Hey, please. Please. Yes, sir, Mr. Nino.

492
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,642
- I was this close to having you.
- Yes, I felt it.

493
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,440
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

494
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,450
Mr. Nino will see you right now.

495
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,525
Jupiter once commanded all the birds
of the Earth to appear before him,

496
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:15,860
so that he might choose
the most beautiful to be their king.

497
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,131
The ugly black crow
collected all the colorful feathers

498
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,104
which had fallen from the other birds,

499
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:26,302
attached them to his own body
and appeared looking very beautiful.

500
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,944
But the other birds
recognized their own plumage

501
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,913
and began to strip him.

502
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:34,150
"Stop what you're doing," said Jupiter.

503
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:38,051
"This self-made bird
has more sense than any of you.

504
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,624
"He shall be your king."

505
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,618
- Can I get either of you a drink?
- No, thanks.

506
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,629
<i>Prendi un</i> prosecco.
Have a seat.

507
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,241
- There are plenty of chairs.
- Thank you, but he prefers to stand.

508
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,353
You're a real guard dog, ain't you?
You found yourself a pit-bull.

509
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,859
- More loyal and can be twice as vicious.
- I like that.

510
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,328
Could probably teach some of my guys
a few things.

511
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,261
Quality over quantity.

512
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,823
In some things.

513
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:30,038
- You know, we've met before.
- Really?

514
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,734
I don't think so.
I'd remember a guy like you.

515
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,779
Well, this was a long time ago,
before I became a guy like me.

516
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,116
Your father was Benny Bollino, right?

517
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,655
I worked a paper route for him
when I was a kid.

518
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,884
- Paper route?
- Yeah, that's what he used to call it.

519
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,756
I ran bribes, picked up extortion money.
Shit like that.

520
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,989
I'll bet it paid better
than peddling <i>The Sunday Times.</i>

521
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:57,625
Yeah, yeah.
Your father was quite a guy, you know?

522
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,534
Loved by his friends,
respected by his enemies.

523
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,163
To accomplish everything he did

524
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,404
and still cross the finish line
due to natural causes, it's amazing.

525
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,201
You think so?

526
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:13,845
My father was a doddering old bag
of bones the last six years of his life.

527
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,215
When he wasn't pissing his pants,
he was wandering around his house

528
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,551
trying to figure out who
and where the fuck he was.

529
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,919
I kept him propped up on a throne,
but I was the one running things.

530
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,394
You know what I'm saying, Joshua?

531
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,967
And as for crossing the finish line
of natural causes,

532
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,667
at least with a bullet
he could have checked out

533
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,762
with some fucking dignity.

534
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,968
I'm sorry you feel that way.

535
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,976
- God rest his soul, I loved him.
- I'll bet you did.

536
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,246
So, tell me,
why'd you kill Frankie Tahoe?

537
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,579
- Who?
- Frankie Tahoe.

538
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,247
Drug dealer. Scumbag. About yea tall.

539
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:55,458
You accosted his bodyguard
outside of one of my clubs last night.

540
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,154
Sent the little pussy home
with his tail between his legs.

541
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:01,664
All we found of Frankie this morning
was a puddle of blood

542
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,597
and a couple of teeth.

543
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,636
And what makes you think
that I had anything to do with it?

544
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,695
I know you had everything to do with it.

545
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:12,503
Bodyguard knew your name,
and that stripper knows your face.

546
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,077
And yours.

547
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,746
She was staying late to give Frankie
his own private show last night.

548
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,979
<i>She had slipped away to grab a rubber</i>

549
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,318
<i>when you and your boys</i>
<i>interrupted the festivities.</i>

550
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,828
Bitch-ass motherfucker! Fuck you!

551
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,501
She saw the whole thing.

552
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,899
That was quite
the Perry Mason moment, Counselor.

553
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,497
- It was, wasn't it?
- Yeah, let's see.

554
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:49,674
I'm ID'ed by a dead chicken-shit
bodyguard and a strung-out stripper.

555
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,442
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do for an encore?

556
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,073
Pull the murder weapon out of her ass?

557
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,813
Well, as entertaining as that might be,
I don't think it's necessary.

558
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,912
The verdict is already in.

559
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:01,955
What do you want to do?

560
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,255
You owe me for the life of my employee.

561
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,491
Well, since drug dealers are pretty
much a dime a dozen in this town,

562
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,657
you got change for a penny?

563
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,561
Frankie Tahoe may have been worthless
in the eyes of God and society,

564
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,265
but he was an exceptional drug dealer.

565
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,476
You all right?
You're looking a little pale.

566
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,682
<i>Richie, un bicchiere d'acqua.</i>

567
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,377
You gotta be careful.
The stress will kill you.

568
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,951
I know how you feel.

569
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,529
I don't want any water.

570
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,889
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

571
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,032
Looked like you were having
a heart attack.

572
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:52,565
You scared me for a second there.
Okay, so, the way I figure,

573
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,344
your little batting practice
cost me at least 100 grand a year.

574
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,403
Profit.

575
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,280
Maybe you can write if off on your taxes.

576
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,046
All right, smartass.

577
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,355
The only reason you and your boy Friday

578
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,584
aren't lying inside
a couple of chalk outlines right now

579
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,456
is because I'm a little curious.

580
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:14,588
If your actions were justified,
maybe we could work something out.

581
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:18,629
So, what did Frankie do?
Kill your mother? Fuck your father?

582
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,027
I have it on a good source
that he was out to kill me.

583
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,505
I'd check that source if I were you.

584
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,544
Frankie didn't wipe his ass
without getting the go-ahead from me.

585
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,738
If he was planning on killing anyone,
I would have known about it,

586
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,713
'cause I would've had to okay it.

587
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,807
The way I see it,
there are several options to consider.

588
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,910
Option A, you pay off the debt.

589
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,420
We'll say,
100 grand for the next five years.

590
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,419
Option B, you work off the debt.

591
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:48,423
I could always use
a couple of good leg breakers.

592
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,661
Then, of course,
there's the unpleasant option C.

593
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,830
That would be
the aforementioned chalk outline?

594
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,437
If there's enough of you left to chalk.

595
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:03,912
You know, there is an option D.
Might be a long shot, but it does exist.

596
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,015
Are you fucking serious?

597
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,882
You can't be serious.

598
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,989
You're a little fish.
Splash, splash, splash.

599
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,691
I'm a shark.

600
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,251
Bank account, body count,
I got you beat on all counts.

601
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,788
I am the ever-present threat
lurking just out of sight.

602
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,434
By the time you realize I'm there,
it'll be too late.

603
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,401
I will drag you down.

604
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,103
- Like that bitch at the beginning of <i>Jaws.</i>
- Okay.

605
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:37,938
Nino, let me explain something to you.
I ain't no bitch.

606
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,675
I'm Roy Scheider.

607
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,311
We all know what happened to Jaws
when he messed with Roy Scheider.

608
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,288
- The shark got blowed up.
- He got blowed the fuck up.

609
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,553
You listen to me.
I don't give a fuck who you are,

610
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:54,458
what you have or who you fucking killed!

611
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,257
Fuck this shit.

612
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:39,636
Vincent?

613
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,556
Vincent?

614
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,810
Honey?

615
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,833
So you wanna tell me
how Bollino knew your name?

616
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,467
- What?
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

617
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,506
I asked you a question.
Do you think I'm stupid?

618
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,151
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

619
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,855
That's the guy I saw outside
of the bodyguard's apartment building.

620
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,160
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

621
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:48,935
Marisa? Fuck. It's going to voicemail.
Motherfucker! Go, go!

622
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,148
Marisa!

623
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,795
Just give me a minute, will you?

624
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,894
Give me a minute.

625
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,339
Listen, I need you to take Julian
over to your mother's.

626
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,917
No, no. Nothing's gonna happen.
Just do it, okay? Please?

627
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,147
Nice wallpaper, Jeff. Really works.

628
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,388
Charlie, now,
what did you have to do that for?

629
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,297
Our employer would like to have
a little talk with you,

630
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,771
ask you some questions.

631
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,003
Think of it as a little chit-chat,
a <i>tête-à-tête,</i> as it were.

632
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:25,104
Should you try to hinder us
from transporting you to said employer,

633
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,116
we have been instructed
to shoot you on the spot.

634
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,483
So, for now, just relax.

635
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,084
Breathe.

636
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,688
Think happy thoughts.

637
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,619
Easy. Hey, easy with him, huh?

638
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,161
Now, if you stay calm,
cool and cooperative,

639
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,035
you may even live to see tomorrow.

640
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,439
Come on, hurry up. Move.

641
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,104
Jesus Christ!

642
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,945
Hey, man. You know it.
You know, I'm only doing my job.

643
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:11,383
You know what'll happen to you
if you kill me, right?

644
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:15,193
Your boss set the pace.
I'm just trying to keep up.

645
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,710
That was for blasphemy.

646
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,462
What are we doing here, Vincent?
What's going on?

647
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,327
Don't worry about it.

648
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,830
That backpack looks heavy.

649
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,665
Joshua, take Jeff's backpack for him,
would you, please?

650
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,797
- It's not that heavy.
- Let go of the bag, Jeff.

651
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,077
Let's all sit down.

652
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,317
Let's see if we can answer
each other's questions.

653
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,659
You go first.

654
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,520
Why are we here?

655
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:25,461
'Cause it's a safe place to talk.
Joshua, you're up.

656
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,629
- Vincent?
- How much did you owe Frankie Tahoe?

657
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:30,931
No.

658
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,533
Jeff.

659
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,974
- Back on the shit, Jeff?
- Nope.

660
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,038
No, Vincent, I was... Oh, God.

661
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,754
All right, let me guess.
Frankie Tahoe gave you a line of credit,

662
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,663
and you got in over your head.
Am I right?

663
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:00,928
Yeah.

664
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:07,199
<i>I imagine Frankie was the kind of guy</i>
<i>that didn't mind pushing pretty hard</i>

665
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,711
<i>when it came to collecting a debt.</i>

666
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,444
<i>Probably looked forward</i>
<i>to bills coming due.</i>

667
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,505
Katie.

668
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,018
<i>And I imagine</i>
<i>he considered working people over</i>

669
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:20,078
<i>to be one of the perks</i>
<i>of being a drug dealer.</i>

670
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,814
What up, Jeff?

671
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,524
You know, little Katie
really starting to blossom, right?

672
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,428
There is nothing sweeter
than some untapped pussy.

673
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,329
I like that little bald shit,
you know what I'm saying?

674
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,594
Fresh, right out of the oven.

675
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,832
That's some grade-A cherry shit, man.
You wanna take a little sniff?

676
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,836
Are you kidding me right now?

677
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,376
I can't believe you just did that, dawg.

678
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:44,470
We're practically family, homeboy.
I just fucked your daughter.

679
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:46,208
You're a dead man.

680
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,445
- What? Come again?
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.

681
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,080
You got no right to be pissed off
at anyone but your damned self, man.

682
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,714
You owe me a lot of money, homie.

683
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,918
I'm gonna tell you right now, dawg,
the way I see it,

684
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,461
you're fucking lucky
Katie was in town visiting, man,

685
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,928
'cause she just bought you some time

686
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,862
and saved you some broken bones,
homie.

687
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,231
I'd rather you broke
every bone in my body.

688
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,130
I would rather you killed me.

689
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,470
No, Jeff, you don't get it, man.
You see this here?

690
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:16,343
This is a lot more fun, homeboy.
Lot more fun.

691
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,841
How much did you owe him?

692
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,553
3 grand.

693
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,831
You lied to me over 3 grand?

694
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,499
You fucking serious?

695
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:47,768
You manipulated and you betrayed me
for $3,000?

696
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,604
You could have come to me.

697
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:53,907
You could have told me the truth.

698
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,178
I would have taken care of it.
You could have come to me.

699
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,446
I know.

700
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:02,251
It wasn't about money, Vincent.
It wasn't about money.

701
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,423
All right.

702
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,764
How long's it been since your last taste?

703
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,768
Last night.

704
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,665
You want Joshua to cook you up a hit?

705
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,467
Yeah.

706
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,921
Did you ever hear the story
of the scorpion and the frog, Jeff?

707
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,757
There's this scorpion.

708
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:43,598
He's sitting on a rock in the middle
of the river and the water's rising,

709
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,896
and he knows he's gonna drown.

710
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,203
And he sees this frog swim by
and he says,

711
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:55,809
"Hey, man, give me... Give me a lift
to the other side of the river."

712
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,846
Frog says,
"You kidding me? You're a scorpion.

713
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,882
"You're gonna sting me."

714
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,746
Scorpion says, "No, I just want a ride.

715
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,922
"I'm not going to sting you, I promise."

716
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:10,789
So the frog says "Okay,"
and they start off across the river.

717
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,194
Sure enough, the frog looks back,

718
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,766
the scorpion's bitten him
right in the ass.

719
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:24,862
Frog says, "What did you do that for?
Now we're both gonna die."

720
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,208
Scorpion says, "I know.

721
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,936
"I'm sorry, but it's in my nature."

722
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:39,116
Hey, soup's on, huh?

723
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,925
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Give me the needle.

724
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,136
Hold still.

725
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,965
- Makes all the difference, huh?
- Yeah.

726
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:37,702
It's the only thing
that stops the nightmares.

727
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,377
You still get the nightmares, Vincent?

728
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,250
Can't dream if you don't sleep.

729
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,595
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Vincent.
- Yeah, me too.

730
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,658
But it's not about the lie anymore.

731
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,326
It's about the avalanche of shit
that's come down on me

732
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,199
because of that lie.

733
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,632
What do you mean?

734
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,641
Frankie Tahoe
wasn't a private vendor, Jeff.

735
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:12,708
He was employee of the month
for the Donald Trump of the underworld.

736
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,244
We pissed off the biggest junkyard dog
on the East Coast.

737
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,487
He's been shitting in our backyard
all day.

738
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:27,287
- Is that who sent those guys for me?
- Yeah.

739
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,190
Thank God you showed up
when you did.

740
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,340
The poor bastards
didn't know what hit them.

741
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:43,744
It was just like when we were teenagers

742
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:47,214
and you dry-gulched
those fucking Grays, remember?

743
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,275
Yeah, I do.

744
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,515
Remember what I used to say about you
after that?

745
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:56,788
You put the "Vince" in invincible.

746
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,062
I don't... I don't know who this big dog is,

747
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,591
- but my money's still on you, hoss.
- They killed Marisa.

748
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,168
No. No.

749
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,739
Yeah, they killed her.

750
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,539
They tied her up,
and they butchered her like an animal

751
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:20,605
because of your lie and my actions.

752
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:27,186
Oh, God, Vincent. Oh, God, no,
Vincent, please. No. Please.

753
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,884
Jeffrey. Jeffrey.
You don't have to explain anything.

754
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:30,983
You're like a brother to me.

755
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,891
- There's a reason, Vincent.
- I know.

756
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,293
There's a reason.

757
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,230
Vincent, you gotta let me explain.
Please, Vincent.

758
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,461
- I know.
- Oh, God.

759
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,456
Oh, shit, it's the guy's kid.

760
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,361
Close your eyes, motherfucker.

761
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,253
This is 50 grand.
It's called severance pay.

762
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,626
It's time for you
to get the hell out of Dodge.

763
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,791
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

764
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,158
No.

765
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:54,109
This morning I owe you my life, and
I can't be trusted. Now I'm in your will?

766
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,171
I ain't dead yet. Just take the money.

767
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,049
Yeah, but here's the problem.

768
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,413
Nino's not gonna be happy
until he kills us both

769
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,715
and everybody we care about.

770
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,460
I can't let that happen.

771
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,626
I'm coming with you.
That's not everything.

772
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:21,232
- Get in the car.
- Damn right I'm getting in the car.

773
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,717
- You fully loaded?
- Yeah.

774
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,918
Work your way around the pool
and find a way in.

775
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,889
- I'll see you inside.
- How are you going in?

776
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,358
Front door.

777
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,708
Twenty-four, and I got 19.

778
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,811
I gotta go to work.

779
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,483
- You need anything?
- I already got what I needed.

780
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,689
Three times.

781
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,695
That was amazing, wasn't it?

782
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:13,439
- <i>They got Doc Holliday with them.</i>
- <i>Holliday, huh?</i>

783
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,011
<i>Cotton, you get over with the horses.</i>

784
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:21,147
<i>Ike, I can't take this kind</i>
<i>of gunplay anymore. Cut me out.</i>

785
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,248
<i>Get over there.</i>

786
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,127
Hey, Richie, Nino's looking for you,
and he's pissed.

787
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,465
I think he's looking for Paulie.

788
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,043
Paulie? Paulie Looch?

789
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,915
- That's not a word.
- Of course it's a word. It's foreshadow.

790
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,755
- Ignorant motherfucker.
- What the fuck is a foreshadow?

791
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,488
- Foreshadow!
- "Verb.

792
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:05,490
"To show or indicate beforehand.
Prefigure."

793
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,725
- There you go.
- Yeah, you know,

794
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,430
it's like a sign
that something's gonna happen.

795
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,099
Hey! Any of you jerkoffs
seen Paulie around?

796
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,198
No.

797
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,501
Fucking pansy.

798
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,501
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Paulie, Richie.

799
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,544
- Where the hell have you been?
- <i>Who's Paulie?</i>

800
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,375
- What?
- <i>Who's Paulie?</i>

801
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:55,308
- Who is this?
- <i>Detective Miller, Homicide. Who's this?</i>

802
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,442
What happened to Paulie?

803
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,420
<i>Somebody shot him.</i>
<i>Was he a friend of yours?</i>

804
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,095
Hey, Paulie! Where you been?
Nino's looking all over for you.

805
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,223
Hey!

806
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,294
Paulie's dead.

807
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,131
<i>Seven of them are with Cotton.</i>
<i>I only see six.</i>

808
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,842
- Mr. Nino!
- In the kitchen.

809
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,147
We got a problem.

810
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,658
The police answered Paulie's phone.
Somebody shot him.

811
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,859
Hey, Vincent, is that you?

812
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,965
I was just making myself
a protein shake. You want one?

813
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,973
- I'll have yours!
- Okay.

814
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,146
<i>A salute,</i> motherfucker!

815
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,736
Hey, Mr. Nino, what's going on?

816
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,038
It's an old-fashioned
mobsters ball, Larry.

817
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04,375
- You ready to dance with the devil?
- What?

818
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,676
Just watch the fucking stairs.

819
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,611
Jesus...

820
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,336
I'm gonna go upstairs
and get that son of a bitch.

821
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,895
I'll take care of things down here.

822
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,772
Nino? Nino? Should I call the <i>polizia?</i>

823
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,282
Baby, this is no time to make jokes.
Go hide.

824
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:44,897
Fuck!

825
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,142
Come on, you cocksucker!

826
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:11,732
I'm gonna go grab another beer.
You want one?

827
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,062
- You got it, Johnny.
- <i>Cotton,</i>

828
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:17,731
<i>you chicken-livered, miserable...</i>

829
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,114
Well, I'm a little surprised.

830
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,820
I was unaware that Nino went
and hired us a house nigger.

831
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,557
That's impressive.

832
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:46,365
You want to see impressive?
Let's do this old-school.

833
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:40,115
- Are you wearing a vest, Nino?
- Yeah!

834
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,554
Ain't you?

835
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,787
Fuck, that hurts.

836
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:52,225
I know I nailed you with the shotgun.

837
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,092
How bad is it?

838
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,595
I've had worse.

839
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,474
Well, we ain't done yet, Vinnie!

840
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,061
Motherfucker.

841
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:06,121
Change for a penny.

842
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:43,587
That's too bad.
He was gonna get me a beer.

843
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:41,188
Is this the piece of shit
that killed Marisa?

844
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,917
Yeah, that's him.

845
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,466
<i>Sometimes you can take a wrong turn</i>

846
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:44,672
<i>and find yourself on the most</i>
<i>God-awful stretch of road imaginable,</i>

847
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,245
<i>spinning your wheels,</i>

848
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,377
<i>praying it's not a dead end.</i>

849
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,865
- Tell me about my father.
- What?

850
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,233
My father, Vincent.

851
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:15,069
Your father was a junkie.
He never did anything for you.

852
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,006
I saved you from that. I raised you.

853
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:20,212
You owe me.

854
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,948
How many times
do you want me to tell you?

855
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:25,815
He was a dope dealer.

856
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,480
He owed a lot of money
to a lot of people.

857
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,353
You owe me the truth.

858
01:25:31,426 --> 01:25:33,155
You know the truth.

859
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,427
<i>He was dead before I got there.</i>

860
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:56,517
<i>Love, honor, power,</i>

861
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,109
<i>fear of death,</i>

862
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:05,658
<i>people live for all kinds of reasons.</i>
<i>Some are more noble than others.</i>

863
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:10,258
<i>When all you have to live for is revenge,</i>

864
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,396
<i>it can really bone your quality of life.</i>

865
01:26:22,777 --> 01:26:25,507
You think you can kill me because of it?

866
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:29,876
Well, you can't. You're too loyal.

867
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,586
It's in my nature.

868
01:28:38,587 --> 01:28:39,587
