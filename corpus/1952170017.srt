1
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,004
I'm flying.

2
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,474
I'm flying
over the city at night.

3
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,513
There's lights,
all different kinds of lights.

4
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:32,480
I'm checking all the bulbs,

5
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:36,019
and i get to this one big
silver light bulb,

6
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:39,022
and it's busted,
and it won't turn on,

7
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,989
and i can't fix it.

8
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:44,527
Oh. There's this
big slot machine, you know,

9
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:47,530
and, uh, it's live,

10
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,532
and i keep
feeding it quarters,

11
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,802
and i get a shock,

12
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,002
so i check the cables,

13
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:57,540
and the cables
are sticking out of my chest,

14
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:00,008
and they're attached
to my heart,

15
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:04,047
and i want to-
i want to yank them out,

16
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:06,014
but my arms won't move

17
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,051
because they're-
they're just frozen.

18
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:09,517
You know how you...

19
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:11,554
anyway,
it's a stupid dream.

20
00:01:11,589 --> 00:01:13,521
It woke me up.

21
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:16,058
That's
what woke me up.

22
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,561
It's an alimony dream.

23
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,028
What?

24
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:22,065
It's obvious
it's an alimony dream.

25
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,032
No. That's a nightmare,

26
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,569
and i don't need to go
to sleep to have it.

27
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,573
Is that me or you?

28
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,575
Me.

29
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,504
The body of christ.

30
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:13,509
The body of christ.

31
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,532
Excuse me.

32
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,534
The body of christ.

33
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,538
Excuse me.

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,302
What do you think
you're doing here?

35
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,054
She happens to be
my goddaughter, too.

36
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:01,557
No. You don't belong
to this family anymore.

37
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,561
What do you look like?

38
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:07,563
"Gus don't pay me
enough alimony

39
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,565
to buy decent clothes"?

40
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:12,568
You're supposed to believe
in these things to be here,

41
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,535
which you don't,
as we know,

42
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,572
so why don't you
do me a favor, huh?

43
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,039
I was invited.

44
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,077
By who? Of course
you weren't invited.

45
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:22,543
I got an invitation.

46
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:25,581
You got an invitation
don't mean you're invited.

47
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:28,584
The polite thing is
you don't show up.

48
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,087
Yeah, well, i did.

49
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,089
Is that your girlfriend?

50
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,556
Whoa. Just a minute.

51
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:39,095
You don't talk to me,
i don't talk to you.

52
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,596
That's really mature.

53
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,098
Yeah, right.

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,602
Give me a big smile.

55
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,604
I got to go.

56
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,357
Why don't we go
over to your sister's?

57
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,574
Are you kidding me?
If she sees my car,

58
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,112
i'll have her lawyer
breathing down my neck.

59
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:58,114
Don't you pay
what you're supposed to?

60
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,081
What? What?

61
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,582
I'm just asking.

62
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,369
This woman
feels trapped-

63
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,121
trapped
in the neighborhood,

64
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:06,587
trapped as my wife.

65
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,125
She leaves me,
goes to college,

66
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,591
and here's the joke-

67
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,629
she leaves, i'm trapped
to pay for it.

68
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,149
"Supposed to"
don't come into it.

69
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:18,910
You don't have
to shout at me, gus.

70
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:21,792
I know. It's just...
i look at her...

71
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,735
i just have to see her,
and i go nuts.

72
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,643
You never told me
she was so beautiful.

73
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:29,145
You think
she's beautiful?

74
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,898
She looks like a slob.

75
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,792
No. She looks good.

76
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,652
Who's driving? You see?

77
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:39,620
No. Why?

78
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,158
You wanted to go.
Let's go.

79
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,631
How was it?

80
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,633
I don't see this guy
forever,

81
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:56,137
and in 10 seconds,
i want to kill him.

82
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:59,175
Anyway, i did it.
My hands are shaking, but...

83
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,149
i like that you
waited for me.

84
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:11,187
I know-for a change,
my waiting for you.

85
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:13,707
I didn't mean that.

86
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:16,192
How long do you have?

87
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,696
An hour. About an hour.

88
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,198
So?

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,186
What are you
waiting for?

90
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:30,138
I mean,
drive faster!

91
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:34,077
I used to bowl here
when i was a kid.

92
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:37,080
First place my old man
took me to.

93
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,047
Now look at it.

94
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:41,084
You know
this place?

95
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,086
Yeah.
I bowled here.

96
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,553
So did i.

97
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:47,590
When was
you there?

98
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,557
When i was a kid.

99
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,559
Jesus. It's macaroni
down there.

100
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:54,597
Don't stick your head
down in the hole.

101
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:56,099
Use your tester.

102
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,600
Hide your wallets.

103
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,103
Here comes your
investment counselor.

104
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,604
Oh! Pope.

105
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,605
Hey.

106
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:05,608
I got to talk to you
about the turkey deal.

107
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,610
Harvey,
i don't eat turkeys.

108
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,112
You don't have to.

109
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:11,614
Am i a martian
or something?

110
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:14,117
I can't explain
a simple idea?

111
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,619
Buy turkeys cheap,
sell them expensive.

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,122
It's like commodities-
rubber, coffee.

113
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,623
We buy turkeys.

114
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,626
What's so hard
to understand there?

115
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,593
You guys are a trip.

116
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,596
Every week you got
a different scheme.

117
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:33,136
One of these days,
we'll be over on easy street.

118
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,137
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,775
Hey! Hey, gus!

120
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,812
I need that car,
man!

121
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,815
Hey! Bring it in!

122
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:47,782
Up.

123
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,319
All right.
How about it?

124
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,786
Forget it.

125
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:56,325
Hey, gus, come on!
Hey! I'm paying cash!

126
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,827
You said 50,000?

127
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,293
Mm-hmm.

128
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,796
Take a look
at these forms.

129
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,298
Bring them to third floor
admissions.

130
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,336
Look for the signs that say
"to radiology".

131
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,606
Yeah.

132
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:12,492
Gus: Uhh!

133
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,344
Uhh! Uhh!

134
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,348
Sign here for me,
please.

135
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,856
I got to get
straight back.

136
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,357
Kiss me.

137
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,360
Mmm.

138
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:34,328
This is a hospital.

139
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,366
I know. Your kisses
make me better.

140
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,833
I'm working.

141
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,370
Isn't there, like,
a closet

142
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:43,838
we could
go play doctor in

143
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:47,341
or a gurney
we could lay down on?

144
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:50,379
Why didn't you come over
before my shift?

145
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:51,846
I was working.

146
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,633
Rita, you know
i like to clean up.

147
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,386
I smelled
like a freaking sewer.

148
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,853
I got a shower-

149
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,140
you want to
take the elevator

150
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,357
back where
you came from.

151
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,395
Follow the signs,
go to the third floor.

152
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:12,902
Push me.

153
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:14,368
What?

154
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,370
They'll think
i'm a patient.

155
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,408
You got my message
about friday, right?

156
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,875
Yeah. Ok.

157
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,877
If i stop
paying alimony,

158
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,914
that company's
in big trouble.

159
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:26,433
What about saturday?

160
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:27,943
Saturday, i'm on nights.

161
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:29,949
This relationship,
i swear,

162
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,886
you need a degree
in planning.

163
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,425
If we had a place-
i know this subject is taboo-

164
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,196
this would not
be a problem.

165
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,933
C- co...
can you say this word-

166
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,399
commitment?

167
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:48,938
C- c-c-c-c...
m- m-m-m...

168
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:50,404
nah.

169
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,441
Which way
is speech therapy?

170
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,908
Get out.

171
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,945
Hey,
i'm only kidding.

172
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,828
All right.

173
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,365
You got the keys?

174
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,831
Yeah.

175
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,367
Look at this place.

176
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,136
Where are the lanes?

177
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,836
In the basement.

178
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,873
That sign alone
is worth something.

179
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,642
Oh, man,
this is great.

180
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,342
Be careful
in there.

181
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,380
You see, this to me
is beautiful.

182
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:15,846
Say this goes wrong.

183
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,883
It's not like
turkeys, harv.

184
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,850
You screw up
with turkeys,

185
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,852
it's sandwiches
your whole life.

186
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,890
You screw up here,
do lots of bowling.

187
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,893
You can't like a turkey,
you know.

188
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,860
You can't feel for them.

189
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,898
It's like those
things in the necks,

190
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,667
thecomo se llama
things.

191
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,367
You go
into business,

192
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,405
it's got to be
something you love.

193
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,871
My father loves dresses.

194
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,873
My uncle adores
surgical supports.

195
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,412
What has love got to
do with it anyway?

196
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,431
Gizzards!
That's what it is.

197
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,442
Man, they are
disgusting.

198
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,698
I spoke with the realtor.

199
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,920
I can make
a good deal.

200
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,922
This place
is in foreclosure.

201
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,925
Any decent offer,
the place is ours.

202
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,428
The only problem
is electrical work.

203
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,930
Somehow, i think
we can manage.

204
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,397
No, no.

205
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,435
We could be very
comfortable with this,

206
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,936
very comfortable.

207
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,455
I quit.

208
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,904
Please.

209
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,906
No, no. Hypnosis.

210
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,944
Amazing. 100 bucks-
whew-completely clear.

211
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,964
You paid 100 bucks
to a hypnotist?

212
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,726
I spend $100 a month
on cigarettes.

213
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,453
After one month,
i'm in profit.

214
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,954
When did you quit?

215
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,421
Yesterday.

216
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,459
Hey, pork chop!
Easy with the floors.

217
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,461
This may be
our livelihood.

218
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,962
Star lanes.

219
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,429
What?

220
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,966
Star lanes.
Stars got 5 points.

221
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,969
There's 5 of us. Huh?

222
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,936
Star lanes.

223
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,973
That's
a terrible name.

224
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,440
What was its name?

225
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,478
If there's only one,
it'sthebowling alley.

226
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:53,944
It's huge.

227
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,446
It needs more lights.

228
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,483
Big deal.
Needs more everything.

229
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:00,003
Going to be
lots of work.

230
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,488
This is
a lot of work

231
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,489
we'll do
for ourselves.

232
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,991
This could be
beautiful.

233
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,493
This could be great.

234
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,460
Fellas, fellas,

235
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,997
polish up
your bowling balls

236
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,500
and leave everything
to me.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,502
Star lanes.

238
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,505
I like it.

239
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,006
I was just thinking...

240
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,510
i got an uncle in gloverston
who makes shoes.

241
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,513
I could talk to him
about making bowling shoes.

242
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,516
We know lots of people
between us,

243
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,017
carpenters and stuff.

244
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,519
Yeah.

245
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,020
What?

246
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,523
I'm dreaming.

247
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:38,989
Why do you say that?

248
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,777
Where am i going
to find my share?

249
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,530
Each month,
you set some aside.

250
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,497
Take out a loan.

251
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:49,535
It pays for a fatal
disease i got

252
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,502
called an ex-wife.

253
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,790
I don't figure alimony.
You pay that forever?

254
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,186
A new car, you make
36 payments, it's yours.

255
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:01,547
I keep paying unless
she gets married again.

256
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,048
So there's your solution.

257
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,550
Find her
another husband.

258
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,017
That's a good one,
pope.

259
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,055
Put that in
the suggestion box.

260
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,062
Gus, um...

261
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,065
does-does rita like you
to wear aftershave?

262
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,567
What?

263
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,570
What do you
make of this?

264
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,575
It's ok.

265
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,076
How about this?

266
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,579
What is this,
a promotion?

267
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,083
Let me see
the other one.

268
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,586
Just, uh,
which one's more me?

269
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,087
Ok. I'll tell you.

270
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,589
Pope, listen.

271
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,591
Some women
like us better

272
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,593
without any
of this crap.

273
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,094
Soap and water.

274
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:53,564
Yeah, but i want to
smell good, you know?

275
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,101
Who's the owner of this
important nose, anyway?

276
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,103
She works
with my brother.

277
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,605
Is she italian?

278
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,106
No.

279
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,608
Italian girls
are killers.

280
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,109
She's not italian.

281
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,612
Start saying
a hail mary

282
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,115
and see if
she moves her lips.

283
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,118
Hey. Think about my idea.

284
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,121
It's not telling her
to marry somebody.

285
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,124
Arrange for her to
meet somebody.

286
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,626
You think she's dumb?

287
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,629
She could fit your brain
inside her brain

288
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,632
and still have room
for a bowling ball.

289
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,635
Do me a favor.
Don't mention it again.

290
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,637
I'll see you tomorrow.

291
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,105
We already made you
a loan,

292
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,142
and we're garnishing
your salary

293
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,609
until you catch up.

294
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,111
Garnish?
What am i, a salad?

295
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,149
I've been with this company
for 8 years.

296
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,151
Doesn't that
count for anything?

297
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,653
I'm sorry,
mr... demarco.

298
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,120
It's tough times.

299
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,657
What about a payment plan?

300
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,125
That's what you've got.

301
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,664
What about a payment plan
for my payment plan?

302
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,631
No?

303
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,670
I guess not, huh?

304
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:05,636
Hard times?

305
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,174
What does he know
about hard times?

306
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,176
What does he know?

307
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,643
Nothing.

308
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,144
Pope: Please
don't hassle him.

309
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:17,182
Gus, there's a time
problem on this deal.

310
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,686
We got to know
if you're in or out.

311
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,687
I'm out.

312
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,688
He's not out.

313
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,155
He ain't in.

314
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,942
What about
pope's idea,

315
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:28,836
find some
sorry sucker,

316
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,661
marry off
your old lady?

317
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,198
There are people who
take care of these matters.

318
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,199
Pal,
you getting in?

319
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,200
He's deciding.

320
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,452
Let him decide
later.

321
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,346
Nick lippi
lost his wife.

322
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,545
What about him
and leonora?

323
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,709
He's a dope,
and he's free.

324
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,228
He's not a dope...

325
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,677
and he's not free.

326
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,215
Hey, hey, my friend,
give us a break.

327
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,182
Hey. Giveus
a break.

328
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,220
There are other people
interested in this venture.

329
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,687
Harvey!

330
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,224
We got to
let him know.

331
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,190
Lou cassells.

332
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,227
Let's give him
another week.

333
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,694
Lou cassells?

334
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,082
What if we give him
another week?

335
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,073
Professor?

336
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:15,574
Hi.

337
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,076
Um, yeah. I was-

338
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,578
where are you
going for lunch?

339
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,080
Where are you going?

340
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,083
If i knew
where you were going,

341
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,585
i'd know where
i was going,

342
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,587
where we might
auspiciously collide.

343
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,089
Well, across the street.

344
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:31,590
Oh. That's amazing.

345
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,092
That's where
in one minute

346
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,094
i'll decide to go.

347
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,595
Come on. Come on.

348
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,847
Let's
grab something.

349
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,599
Did you
sleep with him?

350
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:41,565
What?

351
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,102
Did you or not?

352
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:45,069
Hi, joyce.

353
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,570
He's cute and all,

354
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,107
but i'm
telling you...

355
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,610
hey, baby.

356
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,616
Go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

357
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,620
What are you doing here?

358
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,087
You can't take it

359
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,125
now that the shoe's
on the other foot.

360
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,091
What?

361
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,128
Embarrass me
with my people,

362
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:10,594
i embarrass you.

363
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,131
I am not embarrassed.

364
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,597
Who's the guy?

365
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,100
What guy?
Those are girls.

366
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,138
The guy with the library
under his arm.

367
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,640
I want to talk to you.

368
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,107
I'm busy.

369
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,645
I thought you college kids
were permanently on vacation.

370
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,148
You know,
i have a job.

371
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,614
You know this.

372
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,902
I pay $12,000 a year
just for tuition.

373
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:37,156
Ipay $12,000
just for your tuition.

374
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,658
Think i want your money?

375
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,125
Do me a favor.

376
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,164
Marry some other bastard
and screw up his life.

377
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,131
I'll pay back
every cent.

378
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,669
You won't pay me back
because you don't care.

379
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,136
I got something going.

380
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,424
I bet that guy
can't even change a fuse.

381
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:58,820
Look, i don't want
to fight with you.

382
00:17:58,855 --> 00:18:02,181
I'm talking about
5 minutes of your time.

383
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,684
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

384
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,151
Hey!

385
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,188
I got this
golden opportunity.

386
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,155
Listen to me.

387
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,693
Remember that bowling alley
we used to go to?

388
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:16,195
Bowling alley?

389
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,696
Yeah.

390
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,700
You know what's
astonishing to me?

391
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:22,666
What?

392
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,668
I see you, i think,

393
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,207
"i knew him from the day
i was born.

394
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,174
"I thought i loved him.

395
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,712
I went to church
and married him. "

396
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,215
I think, "how? Why?"

397
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,681
Oh, christ.

398
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,183
Was i mentally ill?

399
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,220
Was i completely
deranged?

400
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,222
You know-
you know something?

401
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,724
Who gives a shit

402
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,191
whether you can
change a fuse

403
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,729
if the wires aren't
connected in your head?

404
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,731
Do you follow?

405
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,233
Of course not.

406
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:55,734
What?

407
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,246
I just can't-
i can't tell you

408
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,713
what it feels like
to me

409
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,751
to know that there's
so much to know,

410
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,253
so many...

411
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,507
what am i
trying to say?

412
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,724
I walk into the library,

413
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,012
and i think because
i read all this stuff,

414
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:27,231
and i haven't even
scratched the surface,

415
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,770
and you can laugh at me,
but it makes me dizzy.

416
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,022
I'm not laughing.

417
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,916
Listen, i go dizzy.

418
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,741
I run to the car.

419
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,280
I'm running to
get to my car

420
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,247
to come here.

421
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,250
When i say "run,"
i mean "hurry. "

422
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,288
Don't think you have
any power over me.

423
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,760
Listen. I look at you.

424
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,300
When we make love,
i look at you.

425
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,808
Tell me
i have to go now.

426
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:13,312
No. I don't want to.

427
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:27,309
I don't want you
to go anywhere.

428
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,578
Right, right, right.

429
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,081
When i make mine,

430
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,084
i get water,
sort of, like, puddles,

431
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:37,836
under the spaghetti.

432
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,052
I heard they use

433
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,590
the thing
from the bull-

434
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,591
its thing.

435
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:44,057
What thing?

436
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:46,594
The tassel,
to thicken the sauce.

437
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:49,097
They call a bull's penis
a tassel?

438
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:51,600
That's what
they call it.

439
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,101
Where's
the chips?

440
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:55,103
You need beer?

441
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,104
Yeah.

442
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,607
Your tassel pulled?

443
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,608
I tried the bank.

444
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,075
I tried my uncle.

445
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,113
I'm high one thing,
i'm low something else.

446
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:08,116
It's the squeeze.
My leverage is poor.

447
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,117
Who the fuck knows?

448
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:12,120
I called my nephew
the ex-priest.

449
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:14,139
I can't borrow
from him.

450
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,124
Not to borrow money,
chooch,

451
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,091
to date your wife.

452
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:21,129
Hey! What is it
with you guys, huh?

453
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:24,132
I can't introduce
2 lonely people?

454
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,599
The answer is no.

455
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,601
Anyway,
she's not my wife.

456
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:29,387
Ex-wife. What's
the difference?

457
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,782
Once married,
always married.

458
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:34,107
That's what
they taught us.

459
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:37,646
Yeah? Who taught you,
the priest or ex-priest?

460
00:21:38,146 --> 00:21:41,650
Dante's driving me mental
about this operation.

461
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,419
He's having
an operation?

462
00:21:43,454 --> 00:21:45,153
No. I'm having
an operation.

463
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:46,620
I got a gallstone.

464
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,121
I'm having an operation.

465
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:50,659
He can't sleep
for the worry.

466
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,161
I wish
i could get gus

467
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,628
to worry about me.

468
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,130
This guy,
love him less, rita.

469
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:01,169
You love him less,
he'll love you more.

470
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:04,172
Yeah?
How do i do that?

471
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:08,176
I'm sorry, but i think
leonora poisoned the well.

472
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,179
There are 3 sides
to every story-

473
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:13,146
his, hers,
and the truth.

474
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:16,184
What is that
supposed to mean?

475
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:19,653
Oh, honey,
it's history.

476
00:22:19,688 --> 00:22:22,656
They were kids.
He's still a kid.

477
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,694
Hannah's right.
He should thank god for you.

478
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,213
It's not history.

479
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:28,662
He's embarrassed

480
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:31,700
because he can't
go in with his friends

481
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:33,166
because of the alimony.

482
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:37,205
He's too scared
to live with me.

483
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,675
These men,
they can't help it.

484
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,213
That's one race,
and this is another.

485
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,181
Oh, god.

486
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:50,218
Now she's crying.

487
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,220
Oh, sweetheart.

488
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:54,723
Come on.

489
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,191
Come on.

490
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:02,731
Ok.
Cry on those.

491
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,699
What?

492
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,701
But this is my gnocchi.

493
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:11,239
She cries on these
and feeds them to gus.

494
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:13,206
He swallows her tears,

495
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:15,744
means he'll never
break her heart.

496
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,746
Now i heard everything.

497
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,212
It works.

498
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,250
I still got wedding cake
under my pillow.

499
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,252
We been happy 28 years.

500
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,719
What wedding cake?

501
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:28,256
A piece
of my wedding cake.

502
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,723
Like, crumbs?

503
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:33,261
No. It's in a thing,
a little silk purse.

504
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:34,763
Crumbs.

505
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,279
Good.

506
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,116
Excuse me.

507
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,118
I'm looking for a woman.

508
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,619
Leonora demarco.

509
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,122
She's working
in the potting room.

510
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:03,125
That's the second door
on your left.

511
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,126
Thank you.

512
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:05,627
You're welcome.

513
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:24,646
Why this feeling?
Why this glow?

514
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:26,648
Mr. Wonderful?

515
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:28,115
Excuse me?

516
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,153
Funny face
seeks mr. Wonderful.

517
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:34,121
I guess i got
the wrong guy.

518
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:37,624
Yeah, you got the wrong
guy, all right.

519
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,662
You looked like you were
looking for someone.

520
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,164
Aquatic greenhouse,
3:00, and...

521
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:43,665
no. Sorry.

522
00:24:52,174 --> 00:24:53,425
Whoa!

523
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,819
Sorry.

524
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,143
It's ok.

525
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:59,181
Hey, it's the perfect
job for you.

526
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:02,184
You hate cleaning,
and you hate kids.

527
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,151
What is your problem?

528
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:08,690
Do i come and bug you
at your place of work?

529
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:10,657
You're right.
I'm a jerk.

530
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:13,195
Listen, i just came
to apologize

531
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,697
because
i was being a jerk,

532
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,199
and i'm sorry.

533
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,665
And?

534
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,701
And nothing.

535
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:22,669
Just
for the record,

536
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:25,207
i never said
i hated kids.

537
00:25:25,242 --> 00:25:26,673
You did.

538
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,211
Actually,
i love babies.

539
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:30,712
But, anyway.

540
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:32,179
Anyway.

541
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:35,217
So i was wrong
about the babies.

542
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,683
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:39,221
I'm kind of sorried out.

544
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:43,225
Hey, look, i don't
want to bother you,

545
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,691
but out of curiosity,

546
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,229
what are they
paying you here?

547
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,695
What?

548
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,732
Nothing.
It's poop and scoop.

549
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:52,199
I can see that.

550
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,701
Listen, i spoke
to uncle bruno-

551
00:25:54,736 --> 00:25:58,240
what do you mean,
you spoke to uncle bruno?

552
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:00,707
The deli
would pay you more,

553
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:03,745
which means i could
pay you less,

554
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,747
and you won't
feel guilty.

555
00:26:05,782 --> 00:26:07,249
We could be happy

556
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:09,716
and forget
all this bullshit.

557
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:12,754
You have any idea
the strings that were pulled

558
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,221
to get this job?

559
00:26:14,256 --> 00:26:17,259
Nothing could drag me back
to that neighborhood.

560
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,779
You were always
ashamed of me,

561
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,229
ashamed
of where you come from.

562
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:23,765
You dumped me.
You're still a guinea.

563
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,233
I didn't.

564
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,735
Sorry.
I must be delusional.

565
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,773
I must be thinking
of some other girl

566
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,240
who walked out.

567
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,242
Are you mr. Wonderful?

568
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,279
No, no, no.
This always happens.

569
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:39,281
You're mr. Wonderful,
right?

570
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:41,283
Funny face?

571
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:43,284
No.
I'm not funny face.

572
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,751
You're mr. Wonderful.

573
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,788
You're meeting a lady.
3:00.

574
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:48,557
So what's going on?

575
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:50,257
She's waiting for you.

576
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,295
She probably left.
You better hurry.

577
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,297
Hey, thanks!
Thanks a million!

578
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:57,299
What was that
about?

579
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,767
Matchmaking.

580
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:03,770
A little hobby of mine.

581
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,308
You have no hobbies
you can't bet money on.

582
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:07,809
That's what you think.

583
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:09,328
This bugs me.

584
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:10,777
We've changed.

585
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:13,315
I could find you
the perfect guy.

586
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,316
You should let me.

587
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:16,783
No. I'm serious.

588
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:19,320
I found somebody,
and i'm happy.

589
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:21,823
I want you
to be happy, too.

590
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:25,827
You want to find me
a job and a man?

591
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,830
What next? Wash
my underwear? No, thanks.

592
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:30,797
We got
an attitude problem.

593
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,835
We're divorced. We won't
split up over it.

594
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,802
You live in a pigsty.

595
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:39,341
You dress like a bag lady.
You break my balls.

596
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,343
If you want to know,

597
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:44,346
although it's none
of your business,

598
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,849
i have a date now
who likes my attitude

599
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:50,852
and likes the way
i live and dress.

600
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:52,854
Great.

601
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,827
Lee, how are you?

602
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,866
George, i'd like you to
meet one of my students.

603
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:08,370
Lee, this is
my son george.

604
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,372
Hello.

605
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:12,374
Hi, george.

606
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,876
I'm sorry
about this.

607
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:15,877
I'm sorry.

608
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:17,879
It doesn't matter.
Don't worry.

609
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,381
It does matter.

610
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:20,882
It does matter.

611
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,385
Now i've made you sad,

612
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,351
and I-

613
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:25,887
george: Daddy!

614
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:28,390
Oh! Uh!

615
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,893
Let daddy help you.

616
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,899
Come around
the garden with us.

617
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,901
No.
I don't think so.

618
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:40,867
Come on!

619
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:42,869
How can
we persuade lee

620
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:45,657
to walk around
the garden with us?

621
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:48,410
I'll see you
in class, professor.

622
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,376
Bye.

623
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,412
Oh... well.

624
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,422
Mr. Wonderful:
I was worried.

625
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,389
"Oh, no.

626
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,926
She's not going
to show up. "

627
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:06,893
I was waiting for you.

628
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:09,431
Why did you choose
funny face?

629
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,945
Don't throw your
cigarette in there.

630
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,947
I wasn't planning to.

631
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,414
Good.

632
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:29,951
Because i like
those turtles.

633
00:29:29,986 --> 00:29:32,721
Yeah. They know
how to live.

634
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:35,107
Swim around,
mate for life.

635
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:37,551
They don't.
I think it's swans.

636
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:39,961
What do you get,
divorced turtles?

637
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:41,463
I guess it's rough.

638
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:45,216
There's plenty of fish
in the sea.

639
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,470
Not too many turtles
in this pond.

640
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:52,939
Well...

641
00:29:52,974 --> 00:29:54,441
you better get going.

642
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:57,479
You don't want
to miss your date.

643
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,445
What?

644
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,481
Your date.

645
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:00,447
It's tonight.

646
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,484
Oh, now it's tonight?

647
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,486
Yeah.

648
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:07,489
Your date right now
is tonight?

649
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,996
Ok, so who's
this perfect guy?

650
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:15,962
Excuse me?

651
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:19,501
This guy you're hot
to set me up with.

652
00:30:19,536 --> 00:30:22,003
Got a problem
with a working guy?

653
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:23,470
No.

654
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,256
So you'll meet him?

655
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,008
I don't know.
Maybe.

656
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:27,974
Hey, great.

657
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,011
Calm down.
I said maybe.

658
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:31,513
I'll see you later.

659
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:32,531
Great.

660
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:33,480
Hey, lee!

661
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:37,018
I'll find you
a mr. Wonderful!

662
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,254
Yeah. Right. Ok.

663
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:41,456
I'll hold my breath.

664
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:59,207
Hey, marlon.

665
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:00,673
Hey!

666
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,209
What's up, fella?

667
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,676
How you doing?

668
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:05,463
Sandwich looks good.

669
00:31:05,498 --> 00:31:07,180
Your wife make it?

670
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,218
One of the beautiful things
about marriage, huh?

671
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:12,720
Mills, you dead
or still single?

672
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,222
I'm a bachelor, gus.

673
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:16,724
It's terrible,
the junk he eats.

674
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,727
I got a solution.
I know this chick.

675
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:22,230
She's funny, really funny,
and smart.

676
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,232
Look, i don't know, gus.

677
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:26,734
If she's smart,
i'm not smart.

678
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,736
You know what i'm saying?

679
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:32,740
She's not a superbrain
or anything.

680
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,707
Hey.

681
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,744
Hey, harry,
how you doing?

682
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,211
What are you eating?

683
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:40,213
Cheeseburger!
You want a bite?

684
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:43,216
No. They go right
to the love handles.

685
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:46,754
They're only love handles
if you got someone to love.

686
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,221
Got someone?

687
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,259
2 somebodies.
That's my problem.

688
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:53,261
Right.

689
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,267
This is a disaster.

690
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,771
Every one of these guys
is married.

691
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,785
You guys want
some of this?

692
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,554
No, thanks.

693
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,289
It's excellent.

694
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:23,291
Try it.

695
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,259
Pope?

696
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,796
Yeah. Thanks, mike.

697
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,801
Mmm. This is
great meat loaf.

698
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:35,303
I made it myself.

699
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:36,269
No kidding?

700
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:38,806
No. I cook
all the time.

701
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,273
I love to cook.

702
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:41,809
For the whole
family?

703
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:43,328
No. No family, gus.

704
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,088
I cook for myself.

705
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,719
How about you?

706
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:48,281
I like to cook,

707
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:50,783
but i like to cook
for someone special.

708
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:54,322
Well, first you got to meet
somebody special.

709
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:56,289
Whenever i talk to women,

710
00:32:56,324 --> 00:33:00,328
i feel like
i got a hump on my back.

711
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:03,331
No. I don't
see any hump.

712
00:33:03,366 --> 00:33:05,350
I got
a lot to give.

713
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,335
I got a nice house.

714
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,337
Keep it nice.

715
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,339
But i don't know.

716
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:14,108
With women...

717
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:15,808
i don't know.

718
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:17,810
Hey, you know,
you guys,

719
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:20,348
you're getting me
all depressed here.

720
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:21,814
Mikey. Mike.

721
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,816
Just remember this.

722
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:26,854
For every pot,
there's a lid.

723
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,194
You're crazy.
This is crazy.

724
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,661
I know. I know.

725
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:37,163
You're such
a sweetheart.

726
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:40,702
If you sneeze,
i say there's a phone call?

727
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,971
Anything.
Just bail me out.

728
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:45,206
Can you sneeze
when you want?

729
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,673
Ah-choo!

730
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,210
That's a very
realistic sneeze.

731
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:50,479
That's good.

732
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:51,713
Oh, my god.

733
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,716
Oh, my god.
This is him.

734
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:56,235
I don't know you?

735
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,719
Right, right.

736
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:06,728
Leonora?

737
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:08,229
Yeah. That's me.

738
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:09,731
I'm mike crosbie.

739
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:12,233
Hi, mike.
How are you doing?

740
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,234
Ok.

741
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,236
Mind if i sit down?

742
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:17,739
No, of course not.

743
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,751
I never had a date
at 11 a. m. Before.

744
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:34,255
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

745
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,221
Yeah.

746
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:38,259
But i should
get you one.

747
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:40,762
I have one.

748
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:42,764
Coffee, please.

749
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:43,730
Decaf?

750
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:45,767
Sure, sure.
I don't mind.

751
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:52,273
So, mike,
what do you do?

752
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,275
I'm on
the red wagons.

753
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,778
I'm working
the 9 p. m. Shift.

754
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,245
That's how come
i'm free.

755
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,783
Working that shift,
no one will marry you?

756
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:04,250
No, no.

757
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,752
I'm working...
that shift.

758
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,255
That's how come
i can be here. Now.

759
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,795
What you said before,
about getting married,

760
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,797
i wouldn't
want to say.

761
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,764
Excuse me?

762
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:20,802
I wouldn't want
to say right away.

763
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:23,322
I already
told that to gus.

764
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,583
I want to
talk things over

765
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:27,809
with my parents
first.

766
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:32,278
Ah-choo!

767
00:35:32,313 --> 00:35:33,814
God bless you.

768
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:35,281
Uh, phone call.

769
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:38,319
I know. I thought,
"not mike. Mario. "

770
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:40,321
Mario's perfect.

771
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:42,323
What?

772
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,826
What?
Hey, come on. Come on.

773
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,328
You broke the ice,
didn't you?

774
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:49,330
Do this one for me.

775
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:52,834
To tell you the truth,
i already promised mario.

776
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:53,835
Absolutely.

777
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,837
Ok, he's a terrific guy.

778
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:00,341
You got a free lunch
out of it anyway, didn't you?

779
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:01,808
No?

780
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,309
Well, listen.

781
00:36:03,344 --> 00:36:06,347
I guarantee a free lunch
with mario.

782
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,815
Ok.

783
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,817
You're a peach.

784
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,855
I'll talk to you later?

785
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,123
Right.

786
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:16,258
Bye-bye.

787
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:17,323
Yes!

788
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,360
All right!

789
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,328
Who is mario?

790
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,365
A cousin
of loretta's cousin.

791
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,832
Good. So he's family.

792
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:28,336
I got good feelings
about mario.

793
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:29,585
His name's
dominic beard,

794
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,623
and he's a pharmacist
over at the hospital,

795
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:35,126
and he's
a genuine triple "s. "

796
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,593
Triple "s"?

797
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,130
Smart, successful,
single.

798
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,633
Great.
Get his number.

799
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,602
I already gave him
lee's number.

800
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:50,641
This woman is going to be
drowning in dates.

801
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:52,108
Ow.

802
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,146
Do you stab
all your patients?

803
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,115
Up.

804
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,617
I haven't covered
your elbow

805
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,405
because injury's
in the lower arm.

806
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,300
If the injury was
in the upper arm,

807
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:10,249
the elbow would
have to be immobile.

808
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:13,164
Are my fingers
supposed to be numb?

809
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,166
No. You should
have told me.

810
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,168
I can't feel anything.

811
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,635
What's this?

812
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,673
Oh, yeah.
Something's coming back.

813
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,642
And this.

814
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,180
Yeah. Now
i'm getting like a...

815
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:30,949
tingling sensation.

816
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:32,834
Is that good or bad?

817
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:35,028
That's very good.

818
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:37,126
Nurse, i'll tell you.

819
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:39,176
With my hands like this,

820
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,192
it will be hard to...

821
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,164
relax.

822
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,701
This won't hurt
a bit.

823
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,502
You look great.

824
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,396
I feel great.

825
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,256
Go heal people.

826
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,757
Ok.

827
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,742
Hey.

828
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,280
Let's look for
a place together.

829
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,698
I like music-
jazz, classical.

830
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,626
I've got this
incredible stereo.

831
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,593
I like painting.

832
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,096
I like
to make love.

833
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,133
I've studied
tantric sex.

834
00:39:29,168 --> 00:39:30,634
Oh, excuse me.

835
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,101
Ah-choo!

836
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,602
It's good to sneeze.

837
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,890
A sneeze has a force
of 300 miles an hour.

838
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:40,144
People who repress sneezes
are frigid.

839
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:41,110
Ah-choo!

840
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,148
Also, bombs are going off
inside their heads.

841
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:45,416
No kidding?

842
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,650
Think about it.

843
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,652
Bombs.

844
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,127
Hey, jimmy, what's up?

845
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,914
Morning, big guy.
How you doing?

846
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:03,667
This chick is
going to kill me.

847
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,634
She won't let me sleep.

848
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,673
Last night, i thought
i was having a heart attack.

849
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,639
Coffee.

850
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,178
Make that 3.
Black with a lot of sugar.

851
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:15,644
She does this thing.

852
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,147
She gets on me and spins.

853
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,185
I don't know
how she does it,

854
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,651
but, oh, my god.

855
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:26,690
The really strange thing is,
we talk all the time.

856
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:29,693
If we don't
screw ourselves to death,

857
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,695
the talking
will kill us.

858
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,163
Hey, gus! Gus!

859
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,201
This broker's calling me
day and night.

860
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:39,168
What do i tell him?

861
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,205
Nobody sleeps
around here?

862
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,172
Translate that
for me.

863
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,209
He's working
this dating scheme.

864
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:47,211
This scheme
don't make sense.

865
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:48,980
Say she meets
some guy.

866
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:50,679
Over easy,
dry toast.

867
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,717
Say she dates
every night, every week.

868
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:55,684
After 10
or 15 dates,

869
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,221
which isn't
that pessimistic,

870
00:40:57,256 --> 00:40:58,687
she meets mr. Right.

871
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,725
Say she'd like to dine
with the gentleman

872
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,193
before she marries him.

873
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,730
Men are already
living on the moon.

874
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,232
Have some faith, harv.

875
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,235
I do have faith-
in lou cassells.

876
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:12,736
He's got money.

877
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,238
He'll go to bat.

878
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,739
But he ain't gus.

879
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,243
Pope,
the door is closing.

880
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:21,228
The door
is closing!

881
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,005
Hey, what is this?

882
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,972
On every block!

883
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,975
We'll have to wait.
Take it easy.

884
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,013
We'll just be a minute.
Who's winning?

885
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,015
3-2 in the 5th.

886
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,981
Go mets.

887
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:44,518
You guys must be
into plants.

888
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:46,986
We ain't got all day.

889
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,523
You probably got
trees to plant.

890
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:50,541
That's us.

891
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,525
That's right.

892
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,493
Chill out!

893
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:56,530
Your wives
must have gardens.

894
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:58,032
Right.
I ain't married.

895
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,499
Really?

896
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:03,037
Are you paul or joe?

897
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:05,289
Actually,
we're both paul,

898
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:07,041
but paul and paul
sound like-

899
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:08,542
what is this?

900
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:11,545
Why don't we
just go ongeraldo?

901
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,548
Absolutely, paul,
but i was talking to paul.

902
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:17,551
I have one terrific
opportunity.

903
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:18,552
Oh, yeah?

904
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:23,057
How would you like to go out
with a fabulous broad

905
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:26,060
who is highly green-fingered
like yourself?

906
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:33,567
Hello.

907
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:37,071
Wh-what do you mean
jump all over you?

908
00:42:37,571 --> 00:42:40,039
Who? Who?

909
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:42,076
Why are you here?

910
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:44,043
The guy is gone.

911
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:47,081
If i find him,
he's in the hospital.

912
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:49,100
Don't getpaisan
with me.

913
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:50,860
Why'd you let him in?

914
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,551
Because
he was early.

915
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:55,589
You invite a guy
into your apartment

916
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,592
and then wonder
why he jumps on you?

917
00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:00,059
You invited him in!

918
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:02,561
He was a friend of yours!

919
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:05,099
We learned something.
In the future-

920
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:06,868
there will be
no future.

921
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:08,567
Ok.
No future. Fine.

922
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:12,106
Somebody explain to me
how i get in a situation

923
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:15,609
where my ex-husband
is finding me dates.

924
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:17,111
So why'd you call?

925
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,577
What?

926
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:21,115
Because you gave this gorilla
my telephone number.

927
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:24,118
If you had someone
better to call,

928
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:26,120
you wouldn't
have called me.

929
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,122
I'm doing you
a big favor.

930
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:31,590
Would you please
just get out!

931
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,629
You don't know anything
about anything!

932
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,398
Calm down, will you?

933
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:39,098
No! You get out! Out!

934
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,635
I'm going, ok?
I'm going.

935
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,104
Oh.

936
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:48,142
Hey, uh, why don't
you come with me?

937
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,108
What?

938
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:50,609
Come with me.

939
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,646
I'll take you to dinner.

940
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:54,113
No! Absolutely not.

941
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:57,116
If you stay here,
you'll get more upset.

942
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:00,654
I'll take you out.
I'll take you to florians.

943
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:02,656
I'm not hungry.

944
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,624
Ok. Look,
you're right.

945
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:08,412
It's my mistake.
I screwed up.

946
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,165
I want to make it up to you.

947
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,631
I wasn't thinking.

948
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,668
That's right!
You weren't thinking!

949
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:16,670
That's what
i just said!

950
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:18,672
Ok!

951
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:23,677
You got to book florians.

952
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,179
Not me, sister.

953
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:26,645
Big shot.

954
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,147
So, what are you-

955
00:44:28,182 --> 00:44:30,184
you're going out
like that,

956
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:32,186
or you're
going to change?

957
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:34,205
lamchanged!

958
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,190
Ok, let's go.

959
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,693
And don't, please,
make any remark

960
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:41,695
about the way
i'm dressed-

961
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,162
i'm saying nothing.

962
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,699
Or my apartment
or anything.

963
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:51,205
You want to live in shit,
that's your business.

964
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,474
Oh, look.
It's the same car,

965
00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:55,709
before you make
any remarks.

966
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:57,676
I'm not saying a word.

967
00:44:57,711 --> 00:45:01,215
It had a paint job,
which was a trade-off.

968
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,684
I installed
this guy's alarm system.

969
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:09,223
Gus, you love this car
more than life itself.

970
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:12,226
I never believed
you sold it.

971
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,218
Hey.

972
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,755
You crying?

973
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,722
Am i?

974
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:47,761
I don't know why.

975
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,730
I know.

976
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:53,232
I kept thinking

977
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,270
you'd come walking back
through the door

978
00:45:56,305 --> 00:45:57,771
any minute.

979
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:04,278
I thought any minute
you'd call.

980
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:09,783
I kept waiting.

981
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:22,796
Hey, uh, i don't
really want to go out.

982
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:26,300
I mean,
we quit dating, right?

983
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:27,266
Right. Yeah.

984
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,803
No. Whatever
you want to do.

985
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,270
It's a good top-

986
00:46:31,305 --> 00:46:34,308
easy to take down,
easy to put up.

987
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:39,813
But a trade, right?

988
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,280
Yeah.

989
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:45,319
He did you a favor.
You did him a favor.

990
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:46,320
Hey.

991
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:55,295
What language is this?

992
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,814
Latin.

993
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:58,263
Latin?

994
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:02,302
I thought latin
was extinct.

995
00:47:02,337 --> 00:47:06,306
Um, well, plants
still speak it.

996
00:47:07,808 --> 00:47:10,811
And... and i'm learning
to speak it.

997
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:17,818
See?

998
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,821
Poculum.

999
00:47:21,856 --> 00:47:24,324
Mm-hmm.

1000
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:31,581
Anyway, not
everything you learn

1001
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:34,334
has to have a plug
on the end of it.

1002
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:36,336
Really?

1003
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,092
Gus?

1004
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,844
Yeah?

1005
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:47,347
Don't fix things.

1006
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:52,352
No. Better i should let you
blow yourself up.

1007
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,354
Solve all my problems.

1008
00:47:55,856 --> 00:48:00,360
Oh, christ.
I got to make a phone call.

1009
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:03,829
Hello.

1010
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:06,867
I'm looking for
rita calley, please.

1011
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:10,871
Did you knock
on her door?

1012
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:11,872
Yeah.

1013
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:13,874
You knocked
on her door?

1014
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:15,375
Yeah, i did.

1015
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,879
Ok. Look, just tell her
that i called, ok?

1016
00:48:18,914 --> 00:48:19,845
Ok.

1017
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,346
Thanks.
You're a doll.

1018
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:24,384
I'm not a doll.
I am a nurse.

1019
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:25,350
What?

1020
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:27,352
I'm not a doll.

1021
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:29,389
No, no.
It's an expression.

1022
00:48:29,424 --> 00:48:30,891
Jesus christ.

1023
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:34,394
Mmm.

1024
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:40,901
Oh.

1025
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:46,907
I think i did something
to your computer.

1026
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:48,676
Gus, that's my term paper.

1027
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:50,375
Don't touch my things.

1028
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,916
Please, please, please
let me have saved this.

1029
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,918
This is a whole credit.

1030
00:48:57,953 --> 00:48:58,919
Saint anthony.

1031
00:48:58,954 --> 00:48:59,885
What?

1032
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,922
Saint anthony-
he finds things.

1033
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:02,888
Oh, great.

1034
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:04,890
I was going
to recommend

1035
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:07,677
a surge protector
for this machine.

1036
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,430
I don't need
protection from surges.

1037
00:49:10,465 --> 00:49:12,432
I need protection from you.

1038
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:17,938
Oh, thank you, god.

1039
00:49:19,439 --> 00:49:22,442
Thank you, saint anthony.

1040
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:24,444
Whew.

1041
00:49:25,946 --> 00:49:27,412
Wow.

1042
00:49:27,447 --> 00:49:29,950
You're really on it,
aren't you?

1043
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:31,416
Hmm?

1044
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:33,919
Studying?

1045
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:36,922
Yeah. I guess.

1046
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,959
Outside the university,

1047
00:49:38,994 --> 00:49:40,961
your face
was all lit up.

1048
00:49:40,996 --> 00:49:42,427
And your books.

1049
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,714
You got
so many books now.

1050
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,932
You could start
a bookstore.

1051
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,970
You weren't cut out
to be nobody's wife.

1052
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:53,939
I don't want to
think that.

1053
00:49:53,974 --> 00:49:56,977
No. I mean,
not my wife, anyway.

1054
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:59,497
Not a guy
who fixes things.

1055
00:49:59,532 --> 00:50:01,982
Not a working guy,
you know?

1056
00:50:02,017 --> 00:50:03,483
Listen, i'll get going.

1057
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,404
Ok.

1058
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,442
Oh, actually,
there is one more thing...

1059
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,461
that i want to fix.

1060
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:16,411
I'll fix it right now,

1061
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,949
and that's this light
right here.

1062
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:21,218
Who lives
right over there?

1063
00:50:21,253 --> 00:50:23,453
I don't know.
A couple.

1064
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:25,956
All right. Shh.

1065
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,963
Ah.

1066
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,972
The most important thing
securitywise

1067
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,974
is good lighting.

1068
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:45,475
Right?

1069
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,484
There you go.

1070
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,460
Huh.

1071
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,997
Bad time?

1072
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:08,463
No.

1073
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,500
I was just passing.

1074
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,968
I'm tom gough.

1075
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,755
Tom is my professor.

1076
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,900
Yeah?
God is my father.

1077
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,975
So, uh, what's this?

1078
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,513
A little
late-night cramming?

1079
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:25,515
I'm so dumb.

1080
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,483
How does it go?

1081
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,021
What do you
tell your wife-

1082
00:51:31,056 --> 00:51:32,540
i'm going
for a jog,

1083
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:34,024
bang
a couple students?

1084
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:37,027
You must be...

1085
00:51:37,062 --> 00:51:38,295
gus.

1086
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,529
Don't.

1087
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,496
Don't gus me, ok?

1088
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,534
Why don't we jog back
to mrs. Professor

1089
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:46,036
and chat with her?

1090
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,002
Tom?

1091
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,539
I'm going to go,
i think.

1092
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:50,557
Don't go.

1093
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:51,817
No. Go.

1094
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:53,008
No! You go!

1095
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,545
I'll drop by
some other time.

1096
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,047
I was
just passing.

1097
00:51:57,082 --> 00:51:58,816
What do i know?

1098
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:00,515
I should go.

1099
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,017
She's right.
I'll go.

1100
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,554
I'm the one
who's brain-dead.

1101
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,655
Yo!

1102
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,191
Anybody down there?

1103
00:52:58,692 --> 00:52:59,192
Who's that?

1104
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:00,694
Pope, is that you?

1105
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:03,161
Gus?

1106
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,162
Uh, yeah.

1107
00:53:04,197 --> 00:53:05,664
I'm just, uh...

1108
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,951
what are you
doing here?

1109
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:10,203
What are you doing here?

1110
00:53:10,238 --> 00:53:11,670
I'm with marie.

1111
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,207
I showed her
the bowling alley.

1112
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:16,209
One thing led
to another.

1113
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:17,210
Unfucking believable!

1114
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:19,177
Please, gus.
Please don't.

1115
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:21,715
Swear to me
this never happened.

1116
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,234
Swear on your mother.

1117
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:25,244
I hope you're careful.

1118
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:27,185
Yes, we're
being careful.

1119
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,722
I'm not talking
about precautions.

1120
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:31,725
Don't zap your girlfriend's
butt on 6,000 volts.

1121
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,726
Oh, right.

1122
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:34,192
Ah!

1123
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:35,478
That's beautiful!

1124
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,730
You just do that?

1125
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:37,731
Like that?

1126
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:39,232
That's so beautiful!

1127
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,700
No way you're
dead on this.

1128
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:44,738
A star's got 5 points.
You're one of them.

1129
00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:47,205
I got to go.

1130
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,243
Listen, i'll see you
monday morning.

1131
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:59,085
Isn't this a view?

1132
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,588
I love this apartment.

1133
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:02,589
Want to know why?

1134
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:04,556
It's got
light and space.

1135
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:07,594
Linoleum and kitchens
you can change,

1136
00:54:07,629 --> 00:54:10,597
but you cannot change
those 2 things.

1137
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:15,101
We're looking
at a lot of places.

1138
00:54:15,136 --> 00:54:17,621
You'd be
stupid not to.

1139
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:20,106
This is more,
you know,

1140
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:22,073
than we wanted
to spend.

1141
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:25,612
I'll leave you young
people to talk it over.

1142
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:27,614
Lock the door
behind you.

1143
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:33,119
Rita, call me
at the office.

1144
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:44,130
I know i can
make you happy.

1145
00:54:44,165 --> 00:54:45,632
Hey, you do.

1146
00:54:46,132 --> 00:54:48,635
This is... this is
just the best day

1147
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:50,602
of my entire life.

1148
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:52,103
Sorry about
last night.

1149
00:54:52,138 --> 00:54:55,141
You know, i was, uh...
running around,

1150
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:58,144
and i did
an off-the-books job,

1151
00:54:58,179 --> 00:54:59,611
and, uh... you know,

1152
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:01,648
it dawned on me-
the time,

1153
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:03,615
and i telephoned you,

1154
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,653
but, uh... anyway,
i'm-i'm sorry.

1155
00:55:06,688 --> 00:55:08,172
But that's my point.

1156
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:09,621
That's been my point.

1157
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:13,159
You're in your place.
I'm in my place.

1158
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:16,680
You got to call me.
I got to call you.

1159
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:20,166
I want to be there
when you get home.

1160
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:21,633
I know you do.

1161
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:24,170
I want to love you.

1162
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:31,643
Hey...

1163
00:55:31,678 --> 00:55:34,180
don't go
anywhere, ok?

1164
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:42,188
I'm lucky
i found you, you know?

1165
00:55:42,223 --> 00:55:43,690
Yeah, you are.

1166
00:55:43,725 --> 00:55:45,156
You know,

1167
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:48,444
i love this apartment,
and do you know why?

1168
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,698
Because it's got light,
and it's got space.

1169
00:55:51,733 --> 00:55:53,217
It's got
cracked linoleum

1170
00:55:53,252 --> 00:55:54,666
and damp
in the kitchen.

1171
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:58,204
I'm going to leave
you 2 lovely people

1172
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,172
to lay down
on the floor.

1173
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:04,711
No way am i getting
down on that floor.

1174
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:05,677
Ok.

1175
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:08,715
I'm going to leave
you 2 lovely people

1176
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,217
to lie down
standing up.

1177
00:56:11,252 --> 00:56:13,219
Well, that's ok.

1178
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:21,428
I was coming
around last night.

1179
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:22,947
I was brilliant.

1180
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:24,396
You would have been

1181
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,182
astounded by
my resourcefulness

1182
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,934
in getting
out of the house.

1183
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:29,901
I was home.

1184
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:32,188
Well, i called you
3 times,

1185
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,406
and i got
your machine.

1186
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:36,943
The phone was
ringing a lot,

1187
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:39,446
so i put
the machine on.

1188
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,413
You never call.

1189
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:42,914
After
the last visit,

1190
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:45,452
i thought
it might be politic.

1191
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,455
Did you read
my paper?

1192
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:49,456
Huh?

1193
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:51,458
No,
i don't think so.

1194
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,461
Um... no, i think
i might have.

1195
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:56,463
Let's see.

1196
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,966
Oh...

1197
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:01,968
here we are.

1198
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:06,473
And?

1199
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:11,978
It was good.
It was fine.

1200
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:16,483
It was good.

1201
00:57:19,986 --> 00:57:21,488
Some good things.

1202
00:57:21,523 --> 00:57:22,989
Really.

1203
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,491
Thanks.

1204
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:35,251
I could
get away tonight.

1205
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:38,505
Can... we...
see a play?

1206
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:41,007
Sure.

1207
00:57:42,008 --> 00:57:45,011
It's just that i love
being with you.

1208
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,013
I love hearing you talk

1209
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:51,267
about paintings
or... writers...

1210
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:55,021
not just getting
into bed with you.

1211
00:58:02,028 --> 00:58:02,529
Tom.

1212
00:58:03,029 --> 00:58:05,031
Oh, john.

1213
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:11,538
Talking about
not just going to bed...

1214
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:14,541
when you were with,
um...

1215
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,544
gus...

1216
00:58:20,046 --> 00:58:23,049
he's so...
he's not exactly...

1217
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:25,552
plagued by ideas,

1218
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:27,053
is he?

1219
00:58:28,054 --> 00:58:30,056
What else did you do?

1220
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:32,023
Change fuses?

1221
00:58:32,058 --> 00:58:35,061
Strip down the car?

1222
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:39,566
See how long he could
hold his breath?

1223
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:44,571
Actually, he's not
at all stupid.

1224
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,073
Hey,
i was just kidding.

1225
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,078
Hey...

1226
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:05,890
ok, cut!

1227
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:07,392
Cap off first.

1228
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:09,929
Don't cut
what you can't see.

1229
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:10,895
Ok.

1230
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,397
Make good
eye contact.

1231
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:14,434
Get good light
on those cables.

1232
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:16,436
Ok.

1233
00:59:22,442 --> 00:59:24,944
Dante said
i'd find you here.

1234
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:26,446
Ok, cut!

1235
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:28,948
Good.

1236
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:34,954
I had... 13 calls
at work today.

1237
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:36,956
That's
a lot of calls.

1238
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,458
Ok, cut.

1239
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:40,460
It's good.

1240
00:59:42,462 --> 00:59:44,714
I'm not looking
for a husband.

1241
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,858
I had one.
It didn't work.

1242
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:48,968
How you can
get involved-

1243
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,737
you don't know him.

1244
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:52,472
He's using you.

1245
00:59:56,476 --> 00:59:57,477
Probably.

1246
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,481
Probably is.

1247
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:04,233
Ok, cut it!

1248
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,985
I should go.

1249
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:09,489
Hey, gus?

1250
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:10,990
You got a problem?

1251
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,492
No.

1252
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:14,959
I do.

1253
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:16,996
I'm out
of the deal.

1254
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,963
I'm going for a walk.

1255
01:00:18,998 --> 01:00:22,502
Gus, you can't keep
cutting out like this.

1256
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:25,004
Go ahead
and fire me.

1257
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:31,511
I'll give you 100 bucks
for a cigarette.

1258
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,513
Does anybody
like lou cassells?

1259
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:34,479
I don't.

1260
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,516
Would somebody
explain to me

1261
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,518
what's this
obsession with like?

1262
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:40,787
Who likes gus
more than me?

1263
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:42,673
This is
a business deal.

1264
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,524
But we're not
businessmen.

1265
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,491
We're friends.

1266
01:00:46,526 --> 01:00:49,494
I got to go
to the hospital.

1267
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:52,532
Loretta's due out of
surgery in an hour.

1268
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:53,998
You're smoking.

1269
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:56,786
I don't smoke,
so icansmoke.

1270
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,431
You smoke,
so you can't.

1271
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:02,006
How do i
explain to gus?

1272
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:05,545
The realtor told us
we were losing the deal.

1273
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,047
It don't feel right
without gus.

1274
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,317
Dante, what
do you think?

1275
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:12,453
If they were
taking it out,

1276
01:01:12,488 --> 01:01:14,554
they would have
by now.

1277
01:01:16,556 --> 01:01:19,023
I am alone.

1278
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:22,061
I am alone
in this life.

1279
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,149
Gus,
what's all this?

1280
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:27,650
All what?

1281
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,118
In the cabinet-

1282
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:33,121
the fancy glasses...
china?

1283
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,159
I guess they're
wedding presents.

1284
01:01:36,194 --> 01:01:38,161
How come
you kept them?

1285
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:41,164
Hey.

1286
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,130
Hi.

1287
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,631
Does that
bother you,

1288
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,668
having dishes
from my marriage?

1289
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:47,920
It's ok.

1290
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:49,172
Yeah?

1291
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:56,679
You know, she wouldn't
date dominic.

1292
01:01:56,714 --> 01:01:57,645
Dominic who?

1293
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,183
My friend-dominic beard,
the pharmacist.

1294
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,685
Mr. Triple "s. "

1295
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,652
He kept calling.

1296
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:05,688
She never
called back.

1297
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,655
It was a dumb idea.

1298
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,942
I couldn't
get her to do

1299
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,087
a thing
i wanted before.

1300
01:02:12,122 --> 01:02:14,410
Why should
she change now?

1301
01:02:14,445 --> 01:02:16,699
You know what?
I do care.

1302
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,702
I don't want
to use her plate.

1303
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,206
I don't want to drink
from her glasses.

1304
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:26,709
I want to move on.

1305
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,723
Break the plate.

1306
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:41,689
Wha-

1307
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,726
you wanted
to move on.

1308
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:45,228
Break the plate.

1309
01:02:45,263 --> 01:02:46,194
I can't.

1310
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,731
If you won't,
i will.

1311
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,234
You first.

1312
01:03:05,731 --> 01:03:07,465
Oogie,
can you read that?

1313
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,003
Yeah,
table one, place one.

1314
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:14,006
Mrs. Muriel manners.

1315
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:16,509
Oh, yeah.

1316
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:17,510
Whoo!

1317
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:18,976
Yes!

1318
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:21,013
What brings
you here tonight?

1319
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:22,480
I'm the secretary

1320
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:25,017
of the nurses united
against leukemia.

1321
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:27,036
How do you like that?

1322
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:29,047
Completely at random.

1323
01:03:29,082 --> 01:03:30,988
Uh... mrs. Manners,

1324
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:34,026
it says here
you are to forfeit

1325
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:37,029
an item
of your underwear.

1326
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,532
Ok.

1327
01:03:40,032 --> 01:03:42,534
Do i have to say
what it is?

1328
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,037
According
to the card here,

1329
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,540
you have to show us.

1330
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,509
Ok.

1331
01:03:51,544 --> 01:03:53,546
All right,
let's give her

1332
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:55,548
a little drum roll,
oogie.

1333
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,816
Ok.

1334
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:58,201
Bllll!

1335
01:03:58,236 --> 01:03:59,517
Ok.

1336
01:03:59,552 --> 01:04:02,054

let's-whoa!
Here we go.

1338
01:04:04,592 --> 01:04:06,058
How about that?

1339
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,560
Let's start
the bidding.

1340
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,812
Who will
give me 25?

1341
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,564
Who will
give me 50?

1342
01:04:12,064 --> 01:04:13,065
Who'll give me 75?

1343
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:14,532
75!

1344
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:15,818
Who'll give me 100?

1345
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:17,069
100 in the back.

1346
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,036
Do i hear 130?

1347
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:21,323
Who will
give me 140?

1348
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,576
140 in the corner.
140!

1349
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:25,345

01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,079
140 going twice.

1351
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:28,546
150!

1352
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:30,082
Sold to
the jealous husband

1353
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,084
for 150.

1354
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:33,586
All right.

1355
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:35,588
This next forfeit
will involve

1356
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:37,840
2 people
coming up here

1357
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,592
on the stage
and singing.

1358
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:41,594
The card says
they're from

1359
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:44,096
table 20,
place number 2

1360
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:45,598
and place number 3.

1361
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:49,602
Let's have a nice welcome
for dominic beard

1362
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,371
and his lovely
companion.

1363
01:04:51,406 --> 01:04:53,105
Bring them up!
Let's go!

1364
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:56,609
Whoa!

1365
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,128
Yeah!

1366
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:00,578
Hi.

1367
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:02,364
One for you.

1368
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,116
Break a leg.

1369
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,127
Smile, dominic!

1370
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,098
The moment
i wake up

1371
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:24,887
before i put
on my make-up

1372
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:28,641
i say a little
prayer for you

1373
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:33,110
while combing
my hair now

1374
01:05:33,145 --> 01:05:36,649
and wondering
what clothes to wear now

1375
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:40,618
i say a little
prayer for you

1376
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:43,656
forever and ever,
you'll stay in my heart

1377
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,425
and i will
love you

1378
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,060
forever
and ever

1379
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:48,879
we never
will part

1380
01:05:48,914 --> 01:05:50,539
and how
i love you

1381
01:05:50,574 --> 01:05:52,120
together,
together

1382
01:05:52,155 --> 01:05:53,661
that's how
it must be

1383
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:55,132
to live
without you

1384
01:05:55,167 --> 01:06:00,673
would only mean
heartbreak for me

1385
01:06:02,174 --> 01:06:05,142
i run
for the bus, dear

1386
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:08,180
while running,
i think of us, dear

1387
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:09,647
us, dear

1388
01:06:09,682 --> 01:06:13,185
i say a little
prayer for you

1389
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,654
at work,
i just take time

1390
01:06:16,689 --> 01:06:19,692
and all through
my coffee-break time

1391
01:06:20,192 --> 01:06:21,193
break time

1392
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:22,712
i say a little

1393
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:24,222
prayer for you

1394
01:06:24,257 --> 01:06:25,698
forever, forever

1395
01:06:26,198 --> 01:06:29,201
you'll stay in my heart,
and i will love you

1396
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:30,703
forever and ever

1397
01:06:31,203 --> 01:06:32,454
we never will part

1398
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,706
oh, how i love you

1399
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:35,707
together, together

1400
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,226
that's how it must be

1401
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:38,676
to live without you

1402
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:44,717
would only mean
heartbreak for me

1403
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:49,221
can we go now?

1404
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:52,224
Announcer:
Oh, boy!

1405
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:53,743
How do
you like that?

1406
01:06:53,778 --> 01:06:55,227
All right,
dominic!

1407
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:56,729
Dominic!

1408
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:00,983
Unbelievable!

1409
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,199
That was great!

1410
01:07:02,234 --> 01:07:04,737
Yeah, i thought
she said no.

1411
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:06,704
Uh... she did,

1412
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:08,741
and then
i called again,

1413
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:10,207
and she said yes.

1414
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,745
I think she
regrets it now.

1415
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:15,247
Do you know rita?

1416
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,516
No. Hi.

1417
01:07:16,551 --> 01:07:17,715
Hi, lee.

1418
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,252
Jan, this is
lee demarco.

1419
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,755
Lee, this is
jan and martin.

1420
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,757
Oh, right!
Oh.

1421
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:26,223
Hi.

1422
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:28,760
Nice to meet you.

1423
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,228
Hi. How are you?

1424
01:07:31,263 --> 01:07:33,515
Want to join us?
We're celebrating.

1425
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,768
Gus and rita are
moving in together.

1426
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:40,773
Uh, uh... i don't know.
Um... do you...

1427
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:43,741
uh... maybe later.

1428
01:07:43,776 --> 01:07:46,278
Up there,
you're kind of exposed.

1429
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,780
Sure.

1430
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:52,785
Well, have
a good evening.

1431
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,251
You, too.

1432
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,288
Nice to
have met you.

1433
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:58,540
Congratulations...

1434
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,292
on the apartment.

1435
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:01,794
Thanks.

1436
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:07,264
Oh, my god.

1437
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:09,301
How embarrassing.

1438
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,070
I don't think so.

1439
01:08:11,105 --> 01:08:12,805
I think it's great.

1440
01:08:16,809 --> 01:08:19,561
I hope they fall
madly in love

1441
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,314
and all their
dreams come true.

1442
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:24,083
I'm sorry
about that.

1443
01:08:24,118 --> 01:08:25,783
It's ok.
It's ok.

1444
01:08:25,818 --> 01:08:27,820
You have
a nice voice.

1445
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:28,786
No.

1446
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:31,824
Yeah, your... ex
and rita and...

1447
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:32,790
oh.

1448
01:08:32,825 --> 01:08:34,827
I... i should
have thought.

1449
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:36,095
I didn't think.

1450
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:37,329
Don't worry.

1451
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:42,334
You have
a nice voice.

1452
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,300
Yeah, well...

1453
01:08:43,335 --> 01:08:47,339
i love to sing,
just not in public.

1454
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,842
Well, you were
may queen.

1455
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:52,344
What?

1456
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:56,849
You were may queen
at saint anthony's.

1457
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:57,815
Oh, god!

1458
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,853
I was 12 years old.
How do you know?

1459
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:09,862
Oh, mary,
we crown you

1460
01:09:10,362 --> 01:09:13,615
with blossoms today?

1461
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,511
Queen of the angels?

1462
01:09:17,546 --> 01:09:21,373
And queen
of the may

1463
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,877
i remember you.

1464
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:40,059
I don't know
how she did that.

1465
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:42,811
Come to bed, huh?

1466
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,956
You're quiet.

1467
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:47,031
I'm tired.

1468
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:52,071
I got to get up
in, like, 5 minutes.

1469
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:53,037
Hey...

1470
01:09:53,072 --> 01:09:56,575
i look out of
the window at night now.

1471
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,577
All i see are lights.

1472
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,044
What?

1473
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,582
Since i met you-
lights.

1474
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:07,586
Thousands
of electric lights.

1475
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,127
Good night.

1476
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:59,603
I bet i know 2 people

1477
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:01,640
who aren't
sleeping right now.

1478
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:02,606
Huh! Jan?

1479
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,608
What,
are you kidding me?

1480
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:07,646
She couldn't wait
to dump that guy.

1481
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:11,650
Not jan.
Dominic and lee.

1482
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,903
I bet
she's giving him

1483
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,655
something
to dream about.

1484
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:18,157
N- no way.

1485
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,660
No, i'm telling you.

1486
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:25,629
Heaven and back.

1487
01:11:25,664 --> 01:11:27,916
That's where
they've been.

1488
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,169
Look! You made
your point, ok?

1489
01:11:33,172 --> 01:11:34,638
Jesus christ!

1490
01:11:34,673 --> 01:11:37,676
Look, is there more
you'd like to add,

1491
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,445
or is
the point made?

1492
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,145
Because the point-

1493
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,183
the point certainly
is made with me, ok?

1494
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:07,539
So rachel has gone
upstate with george.

1495
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,044
I'm writing
a lecture.

1496
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:14,546
We have croissants.

1497
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,049
We have
poetry to read.

1498
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:20,552
We have shakespeare
on video.

1499
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:24,556
We have...
glenn gould... on tape.

1500
01:12:25,057 --> 01:12:26,558
Call me an optimist,

1501
01:12:27,059 --> 01:12:29,561
but i think
we have the makings

1502
01:12:30,062 --> 01:12:31,563
of a perfect day.

1503
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:36,068
Stop me, you know,

1504
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:38,570
if i stumble across
the password.

1505
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:41,073
Uh... words
are not the problem.

1506
01:12:41,573 --> 01:12:45,077
Who said anything...
about a problem?

1507
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:47,044
I don't know. L-

1508
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:49,581
i thought words
were... an issue.

1509
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:52,084
I thought you were
complaining

1510
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:54,604
about us
not talking,

1511
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:57,054
or...
so, here i am.

1512
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:59,341
Culture,
culture, culture.

1513
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:01,593
Don't always
have an answer.

1514
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:03,595
What?

1515
01:13:05,097 --> 01:13:07,564
Hey...

1516
01:13:07,599 --> 01:13:11,103
i'm sick
of this yard.

1517
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:16,108
I'll tell you
what it is.

1518
01:13:16,143 --> 01:13:17,609
No, don't,
actually.

1519
01:13:21,113 --> 01:13:23,615
Don't tell me
what it is.

1520
01:13:26,618 --> 01:13:29,621
Shall i leave
the croissants?

1521
01:13:31,123 --> 01:13:32,124
Tom...

1522
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:42,134
my work.

1523
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:47,639
What am i
trying to say?

1524
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:48,640
I don't-

1525
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:54,146
leonora,
your work is good.

1526
01:13:57,649 --> 01:13:58,650
Thanks.

1527
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,633
I love
this new place.

1528
01:14:14,668 --> 01:14:16,152
Whoa! Nice view.

1529
01:14:16,187 --> 01:14:17,636
Electric's good?

1530
01:14:17,671 --> 01:14:19,103
Yeah.

1531
01:14:19,138 --> 01:14:22,641
It's got a square-d 2400,
installed 1986.

1532
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:23,642
Really nice.

1533
01:14:25,644 --> 01:14:27,146
I checked it out.

1534
01:14:27,181 --> 01:14:28,147
Naturally.

1535
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:31,615
Checked it out.

1536
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,652
This guy's
an electrical guru.

1537
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:35,654
I am a guru.

1538
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:39,158
Where's your stuff?

1539
01:14:39,193 --> 01:14:41,125
What is this?

1540
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,662
Where is everything?

1541
01:14:43,697 --> 01:14:44,680
Rita.

1542
01:14:44,715 --> 01:14:45,629
Gus, hi.

1543
01:14:45,664 --> 01:14:49,168
Did you call them?
Why didn't you call me?

1544
01:14:49,203 --> 01:14:50,669
They guaranteed me 10.

1545
01:14:50,704 --> 01:14:52,136
What's going on?

1546
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:54,673
Gus and rita
got to talk.

1547
01:14:56,175 --> 01:14:57,141
Hey... out!

1548
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:59,143
Hey, dan,
should i...

1549
01:14:59,178 --> 01:15:02,181
how do i know?
See you later, gus.

1550
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:03,682
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.

1551
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:16,660
What's going on?

1552
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:19,198
I sent
the truck back.

1553
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,168
I was so
embarrassed.

1554
01:15:24,203 --> 01:15:26,955
But they were
real nice, the guys.

1555
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:29,708
Apparently,
it's not so unusual.

1556
01:15:34,713 --> 01:15:37,216
You can kid yourself.

1557
01:15:38,717 --> 01:15:40,719
I'm good at that.

1558
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:45,689
See? He loves me.

1559
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:47,726
He's moving in with me.

1560
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:51,229
See? He's moving
in with me,

1561
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:53,732
so he can't
still love her.

1562
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:59,738
See? He's trying
to marry her off,

1563
01:15:59,773 --> 01:16:02,241
so he can't
still love her.

1564
01:16:02,276 --> 01:16:03,207
Rita-

1565
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:05,209
but you're stuck
someplace,

1566
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:08,247
and i've been
stuck there with you,

1567
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:11,250
and we can put
furniture all around it.

1568
01:16:11,285 --> 01:16:13,252
We're still stuck.

1569
01:16:15,254 --> 01:16:17,756
And as
a matter of fact,

1570
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,758
i can do better.

1571
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,764
I deserve better.

1572
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:49,121
I don't want to lose
this good thing

1573
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:52,624
that i got

1574
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:55,092
if i do

1575
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:56,628
i will surely

1576
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:01,633
surely lose a lot

1577
01:17:02,134 --> 01:17:04,136
'cause your love

1578
01:17:04,171 --> 01:17:06,638
is better

1579
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:09,641
than any love i know

1580
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:11,608
it's like thunder...

1581
01:17:11,643 --> 01:17:13,645
can i ask you
something?

1582
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,611
Yeah.

1583
01:17:14,646 --> 01:17:17,114
Tell me
to shut up if-

1584
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:20,152
first thing i thought
was not to ask,

1585
01:17:20,187 --> 01:17:23,155
because you and rita
just broke up.

1586
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:25,622
I see marie, ok?

1587
01:17:25,657 --> 01:17:29,661
I'll see her
maybe 50, 60 yards away,

1588
01:17:29,696 --> 01:17:32,664
and i'll get
this tight pain.

1589
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:34,631
You know?

1590
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:38,170
Or she's brushing her hair-
something just like that-

1591
01:17:38,205 --> 01:17:40,137
brushing her hair,

1592
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:43,175
and my stomach will go,
you know,

1593
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:45,642
i don't know... funny,

1594
01:17:45,677 --> 01:17:48,930
you know,
when we do stuff-

1595
01:17:48,965 --> 01:17:52,076
i mean, we do
some weird stuff,

1596
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:55,187
and we'll just look
at each other.

1597
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:58,190
You ever hear
of candy pants?

1598
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:01,693
Candy pants-
panties you can eat.

1599
01:18:03,695 --> 01:18:06,198
Yeah, but anyway,
the point is...

1600
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:08,700
what? Am i in love or...

1601
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:11,203
yeah.

1602
01:18:12,704 --> 01:18:14,171
You're in love.

1603
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:17,209
I thought that's
what it had to be.

1604
01:18:17,244 --> 01:18:20,229
Get off here.
Get off over here.

1605
01:18:20,264 --> 01:18:23,215
We got to go-
hey, hang on.

1606
01:18:26,718 --> 01:18:28,685
Do you like to travel?

1607
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,723
Sure. I've been doing
exams and stuff,

1608
01:18:31,758 --> 01:18:34,726
so i guess
i haven't traveled much.

1609
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:36,693
Yeah.

1610
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:39,231
I want to-
i want to...

1611
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:41,233
travel all over.

1612
01:18:41,268 --> 01:18:42,699
Yeah?

1613
01:18:42,734 --> 01:18:45,237
I mean, it's crazy.
I'm italian.

1614
01:18:45,272 --> 01:18:47,204
I've never been to italy.

1615
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:50,242
I've never seen rome.
I've never seen venice.

1616
01:18:50,277 --> 01:18:52,244
I've been
to venice beach.

1617
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:53,710
Um...

1618
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:55,747
i've been to...

1619
01:18:55,782 --> 01:18:57,749
tony roma's?

1620
01:18:59,251 --> 01:19:00,752
Tony roma's.

1621
01:19:00,787 --> 01:19:02,254
That's right.

1622
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:03,720
Uh...

1623
01:19:03,755 --> 01:19:06,258
stupid things,
you know.

1624
01:19:07,759 --> 01:19:10,261
I'm-i'm counting pills,

1625
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:12,781
and i lose my place,

1626
01:19:12,816 --> 01:19:15,267
and it's, "50, lee.

1627
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:17,769
60, lee. "

1628
01:19:19,771 --> 01:19:22,774
L- i'm afraid i'm going
to poison somebody.

1629
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:27,279
Today, i wrote
a prescription

1630
01:19:27,314 --> 01:19:29,781
and put your name on it.

1631
01:19:30,282 --> 01:19:32,284
What were you
prescribing me?

1632
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:36,788
I don't know if this is
horribly obvious,

1633
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:39,791
but i am crazy
about you

1634
01:19:39,826 --> 01:19:41,758
and obsessed

1635
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:43,795
and completely...

1636
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,797
you know, gaga.

1637
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:20,031
This way, guys.

1638
01:20:23,535 --> 01:20:25,537
I don't know
exactly what happened,

1639
01:20:26,037 --> 01:20:27,504
but we lost our service.

1640
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:31,042
We got a 208 installation,
and it just blew.

1641
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,562
An electrician
came to take a look.

1642
01:20:33,597 --> 01:20:36,073
Next minute,
there's this flash,

1643
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:38,550
and he's bounced
off the wall.

1644
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,517
We'll take it from here.

1645
01:20:40,552 --> 01:20:44,055
You'll be all right.
Call if you need me.

1646
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,057
Ok. Thanks.

1647
01:20:53,565 --> 01:20:55,031
So, uh...

1648
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:57,569
what was all that
back there,

1649
01:20:57,604 --> 01:20:59,536
the botanical gardens?

1650
01:20:59,571 --> 01:21:03,074
Something you said made
me realize something.

1651
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:06,578
Something i said
made you realize something?

1652
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:08,044
Yeah.

1653
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:09,581
It's amazing.

1654
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:14,085
I got two fuses dead,
one live.

1655
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,588
So pull
the dead fuses.

1656
01:21:20,091 --> 01:21:22,058
Then that something...

1657
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:24,596
turned into
something else.

1658
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:04,135
Pope!

1659
01:22:17,649 --> 01:22:19,400
I got it.

1660
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,117
Excuse me.

1661
01:22:21,152 --> 01:22:23,154
What do
we got here?

1662
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:24,621
Gus.

1663
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:27,624
Jan, is he going
to be ok?

1664
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:30,662
Lie still.
It's going to be ok.

1665
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:31,628
Just relax.

1666
01:22:31,663 --> 01:22:33,665
Clear
the corridor.

1667
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,167
Hey.

1668
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:41,673
Today-today we got
scalds and burns.

1669
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,174
Yeah.

1670
01:22:43,675 --> 01:22:45,677
I need to cut away
these pants, mr. Demarco.

1671
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,647
I'll be back.

1672
01:22:48,682 --> 01:22:49,648
Rita.

1673
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:51,114
What?

1674
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:53,151
You been ok?

1675
01:22:54,653 --> 01:22:56,119
Yeah.

1676
01:22:56,154 --> 01:22:57,656
Pretty good.

1677
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:40,865
I'm sorry.

1678
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:53,377
Dr. Rostoff,
call the page operator.

1679
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:57,882
I fell asleep.
I must have dozed off.

1680
01:23:59,384 --> 01:24:00,850
I just heard.

1681
01:24:00,885 --> 01:24:02,852
I wanted
to stop by.

1682
01:24:02,887 --> 01:24:05,890
I shouldn't probably,
but is he, um...

1683
01:24:05,925 --> 01:24:07,909
i heard he got burned.

1684
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:09,920
He's going
to be fine.

1685
01:24:09,955 --> 01:24:11,896
You want to
sit with him?

1686
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,649
Oh, no.
I have class.

1687
01:24:14,684 --> 01:24:16,901
Just tell him
i came by.

1688
01:24:16,936 --> 01:24:17,902
Ok.

1689
01:24:18,403 --> 01:24:19,904
How's the apartment?

1690
01:24:19,939 --> 01:24:21,423
We didn't do it.

1691
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:22,907
What do you mean?

1692
01:24:22,942 --> 01:24:24,409
We broke up.

1693
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:28,162
I'm sorry.

1694
01:24:28,197 --> 01:24:29,879
It's ok.

1695
01:24:29,914 --> 01:24:31,381
How's dominic?

1696
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:34,419
He's good.
He's-he's a good man.

1697
01:24:34,454 --> 01:24:37,422
He cares about me.
I'm really sorry.

1698
01:24:37,457 --> 01:24:38,888
So...

1699
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:42,427
i guess it's true
what they say.

1700
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:48,433
Tears-there's only so many
of them to go around.

1701
01:24:48,468 --> 01:24:51,936
Somebody starts to cry,
someone else stops.

1702
01:24:53,438 --> 01:24:55,440
Same with happiness.

1703
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:59,944
No. I hope not.

1704
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:11,456
Hey, you must be
marie, huh?

1705
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:16,961
He loves you.
He was telling me.

1706
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:19,464
He loves me? Good.

1707
01:25:33,678 --> 01:25:35,180
Hey, come on in.

1708
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:37,182
Hi.

1709
01:25:39,684 --> 01:25:41,651
How you feelin'?

1710
01:25:41,686 --> 01:25:44,689
Good. A little sore,
but better, you know?

1711
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:51,696
I never thought
i'd be back in this place.

1712
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:52,662
That's life.

1713
01:25:52,697 --> 01:25:54,164
It shuffles the deck,

1714
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:56,201
and there you are
with the joker again.

1715
01:25:56,236 --> 01:26:00,205
This place is
in kind of a mess,

1716
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,207
which is in your honor.

1717
01:26:02,242 --> 01:26:03,708
Just joking.

1718
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:07,712
I'm sorry
about you and rita.

1719
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:09,179
Yeah.

1720
01:26:09,214 --> 01:26:11,181
It came as a shock.

1721
01:26:11,216 --> 01:26:14,219
What was so important
the phone wouldn't do?

1722
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,223
You want something?
Something to drink?

1723
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:19,724
No.

1724
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:31,236
Dominic asked me
to marry him.

1725
01:26:32,237 --> 01:26:33,738
Great.

1726
01:26:37,742 --> 01:26:40,745
He wants me
to have his children.

1727
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,247
What?

1728
01:26:43,748 --> 01:26:47,252
I said he wants me
to have his children.

1729
01:26:47,287 --> 01:26:48,218
Yeah?

1730
01:26:48,253 --> 01:26:50,255
Yeah. Amazing, huh?

1731
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,756
Weird.

1732
01:26:54,759 --> 01:26:56,726
Said i...

1733
01:26:56,761 --> 01:27:00,014
i needed time
to think about it.

1734
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:02,909
Right. You met the guy
4 weeks ago,

1735
01:27:02,944 --> 01:27:06,359
and you're already
having his kids.

1736
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:09,585
Took me 6 months
to cop a feel off you.

1737
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,700
You'll get what you wanted,
you know?

1738
01:27:12,735 --> 01:27:15,780
The bowling alley
and no more checks,

1739
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:18,248
no more alimony.

1740
01:27:18,283 --> 01:27:20,250
That's right.
That's great.

1741
01:27:20,285 --> 01:27:23,788
Listen, congratulations,
but i got things to do,

1742
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:25,290
so, uh... great.
Terrific.

1743
01:27:25,325 --> 01:27:27,292
Have a nice life.

1744
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,294
Salud.

1745
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:35,800
Ok.

1746
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:43,308
This was mine.

1747
01:27:57,322 --> 01:27:58,823
Hey.

1748
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:02,792
This is my last offer.

1749
01:28:02,827 --> 01:28:05,830
Don't get no sweeter
than this. What?

1750
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:08,833
This is it. Sweet deal.
Bring them in.

1751
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,800
Oh, come on.

1752
01:28:10,835 --> 01:28:12,837
You got to be kidding.

1753
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:15,357
Gus. Gus!

1754
01:28:15,392 --> 01:28:17,807
Hey! Hey!

1755
01:28:17,842 --> 01:28:20,845
Look at his hands.
Oh, my god.

1756
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,312
Oh!

1757
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:25,350
It's a miracle.
Back from the dead.

1758
01:28:25,385 --> 01:28:27,317
He wasn't dead.

1759
01:28:27,352 --> 01:28:29,819
Oh, yeah?
What was he?

1760
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:32,357
He wasn't here or there.
He was somewhere.

1761
01:28:32,857 --> 01:28:35,360
Hey! Welcome back,
you bastard.

1762
01:28:35,395 --> 01:28:37,862
You had us scared good.

1763
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,364
It's a miracle.

1764
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:41,866
You got him back, huh?

1765
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,868
You all met marie,
right?

1766
01:28:43,903 --> 01:28:45,387
Sure.
Hi.

1767
01:28:45,422 --> 01:28:46,836
Hi, marie.

1768
01:28:46,871 --> 01:28:49,374
Oh, by the way, i'm in.

1769
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:50,340
In what?

1770
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,841
The bowling alley.

1771
01:28:51,876 --> 01:28:53,878
My wife-
she's getting married.

1772
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:55,380
She found
mr. Wonderful.

1773
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:57,347
You're kidding me.

1774
01:28:57,382 --> 01:28:59,384
Oh, here's the deposit.

1775
01:28:59,884 --> 01:29:01,851
I hear sirens.

1776
01:29:01,886 --> 01:29:04,889
Where did you
get the money?

1777
01:29:05,390 --> 01:29:06,391
I took the bus.

1778
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:08,893
You sold the corvette?

1779
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,860
Hey, it's only a car.

1780
01:29:10,895 --> 01:29:13,648
I quit smoking.
I quit smoking.

1781
01:29:13,683 --> 01:29:16,401
So, uh, who is
she marrying?

1782
01:29:16,436 --> 01:29:18,420
Oh, you know, uh...

1783
01:29:18,455 --> 01:29:20,405
the pharmacist.

1784
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,924
Dominic.

1785
01:29:21,959 --> 01:29:23,373
Who?

1786
01:29:23,408 --> 01:29:25,410
You know, dominic,
the pharmacist.

1787
01:29:25,445 --> 01:29:28,378
Is that
what you want?

1788
01:29:28,413 --> 01:29:31,416
Of course
it's what he wants.

1789
01:29:31,451 --> 01:29:34,419
He don't have
to pay the check.

1790
01:29:34,454 --> 01:29:36,421
Gus knows
what i'm saying.

1791
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:38,888
If he doesn't, i do.

1792
01:29:38,923 --> 01:29:41,426
Right, and he's been
in a coma.

1793
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:11,003
Hey.

1794
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,540
What's going on?

1795
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,507
Don't ask me any questions.

1796
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:18,045
I'll forget all the names
of these plants.

1797
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,048
This one here is, uh...
it's, uh...

1798
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:23,015
caryota, which is the...

1799
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:26,554
which is otherwise known
as the fishtail plant.

1800
01:30:26,589 --> 01:30:30,558
This one over here is
monstera deliciosa,

1801
01:30:30,593 --> 01:30:32,059
which is your, uh...

1802
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:33,526
ha ha!

1803
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,564
Your basic
swiss cheese sandwich plant.

1804
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:39,567
This one is the, uh...

1805
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:40,568
it's a...

1806
01:30:40,603 --> 01:30:41,534
gus.

1807
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:43,571
Elephant palm,
which is, uh...

1808
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:45,072
what are you doing?

1809
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,539
Colocasia.

1810
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:49,076
I'm trying
to learn something.

1811
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,579
I'm trying
to learn some latin.

1812
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,582
The lights.

1813
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,085
They're beautiful.

1814
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,087
Yeah, they're
pretty lights.

1815
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:03,055
Lee...

1816
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,057
i love you,

1817
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:09,597
and i tried to think
of some way to show you.

1818
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:12,600
All i could think of
was lights.

1819
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:15,603
I put up some lights.

1820
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:22,575
Dominic...

1821
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:25,578
is just parking
the car.

1822
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,114
And i'm telling you
that i love you.

1823
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:30,583
Gus, what am i su-

1824
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,620
i know
you don't love him.

1825
01:31:32,655 --> 01:31:34,086
Oh, really?

1826
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:38,626
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you love him.

1827
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:41,646
You always do this,
you know?

1828
01:31:41,681 --> 01:31:44,632
You always, always
do this to me.

1829
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,136
Ok.

1830
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:53,140
Marry the guy.

1831
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,656
Gus...

1832
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:19,667
dominic:
So can you?

1833
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:25,422
What? I'm sorry.
I'm in a daze.

1834
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:28,676
Can you look me
in the eyes

1835
01:32:28,711 --> 01:32:30,643
and tell-

1836
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:33,430
tell me
that you love me?

1837
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:36,183
I couldn't help
overhearing.

1838
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:39,246
Mr. Wonderful?

1839
01:35:14,392 --> 01:35:17,895
I wake up
each morning

1840
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:21,416
and i try
not to care

1841
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:24,902
going through
the motions

1842
01:35:24,937 --> 01:35:28,871
of a love affair

1843
01:35:28,906 --> 01:35:31,874
times are
just lonely

1844
01:35:31,909 --> 01:35:35,663
when the feeling'
s not there

1845
01:35:35,698 --> 01:35:39,309
and you'd think
that by now

1846
01:35:39,344 --> 01:35:42,920
i'd have
moved on somehow

1847
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:48,926
but i'm
getting nowhere

1848
01:35:50,428 --> 01:35:53,931
and still it's you

1849
01:35:54,432 --> 01:35:57,900
it's always you

1850
01:35:57,935 --> 01:36:05,443
no matter what
i say or do

1851
01:36:05,478 --> 01:36:08,964
i'm still in love

1852
01:36:08,999 --> 01:36:12,450
i guess i always was

1853
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:18,456
i tried to live a lie,
but still it's you

1854
01:36:18,491 --> 01:36:20,423
yeah, you

1855
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:24,211
moonlight
on the window

1856
01:36:24,246 --> 01:36:27,857
so i pull
down the shade

1857
01:36:27,892 --> 01:36:31,469
tryin' to block
the memories

1858
01:36:31,504 --> 01:36:34,990
of the love
we made

1859
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:38,752
lying here
without you

1860
01:36:38,787 --> 01:36:42,385
and the music
won't play

1861
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:45,983
and i'm trying
to sleep

1862
01:36:46,484 --> 01:36:49,487
but it all
runs so deep

1863
01:36:49,987 --> 01:36:57,495
and the dream
just won't fade

1864
01:36:57,530 --> 01:37:01,016
and still it's you

1865
01:37:01,051 --> 01:37:04,467
it's always you

1866
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:12,009
no matter what
i say or do

1867
01:37:12,044 --> 01:37:15,780
i'm still in love

1868
01:37:15,815 --> 01:37:19,482
i guess i always was

1869
01:37:19,517 --> 01:37:25,022
i tried to say good-bye,
but still it's you

1870
01:37:25,057 --> 01:37:26,489
ooh, boy

1871
01:37:26,524 --> 01:37:30,528
why did you have
to have that face?

1872
01:37:30,563 --> 01:37:34,532
One that could
never be replaced

1873
01:37:35,032 --> 01:37:41,038
why couldn't you have
been like all the rest?

1874
01:37:41,073 --> 01:37:45,042
I should have got out
when i could

1875
01:37:45,077 --> 01:37:51,065
but you loved me,
oh, so good

1876
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:57,019
why did you have
to be the best?

1877
01:37:57,054 --> 01:38:00,523

i tried
