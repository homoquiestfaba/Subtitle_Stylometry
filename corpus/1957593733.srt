00:00:01,403 --> 00:00:04,236
(MultiCom jingle)

2
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,604
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,271
(bird chirping)

4
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,845
(soft music)

5
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:51,839
(child yelling)

6
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:45,650
(apple crunching)

7
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,960
- Hungry?

8
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,853
- [Veronica] Don't start with me, Ted.

9
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,560
- God, I got a faculty meeting
in three and a half hours.

10
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,300
- Then what are you doing up?

11
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,870
- After you climbed over me on your

12
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,080
hundredth trip to the toilet,

13
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,940
I couldn't get back to sleep.

14
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,660
- You came in here to make
fun of my weight admit it.

15
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,910
Hey, that's my ice cream.

16
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,160
- What you don't have enough there.

17
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,993
I just want a couple of spoons.

18
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:02,403
- Well, it's mine give it to me.

19
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,459
- [Ted] I'll have a couple of spoons,

20
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,292
and then I'll give it to you.

21
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,190
- No, you give me the whole thing,

22
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,010
and I'll give you a couple of spoons.

23
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,230
- No.

24
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,740
- Don't you trust me?

25
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,820
- No.

26
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,463
- The mother of your child?

27
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,960
- No.

28
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
- You're gonna eat your baby's food.

29
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,773
- Okay, here.

30
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,230
- Sucker.

31
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,360
- [Ted] I knew it.

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,483
- Bring a spoon.

33
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,810
Ted, you know I don't know what's wrong.

34
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,870
I can't stop eating.

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,420
I look like a 200-pound
sack of bird seed, don't I?

36
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:37,891
- Yeah, you do.

37
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,710
- Thanks.
- It's only temporary.

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,553
What are we out of mayonnaise?

39
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:47,213
How can you eat this without mayonnaise?

40
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,120
- Maybe not, Ted.

41
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,300
- [Ted] I don't see any I think we are.

42
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,800
- Maybe it's not temporary.

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,300
Maybe I won't lose the weight.

44
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,710
- Can I tell you something?

45
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,200
You'll lose it it's temporary.

46
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,140
It doesn't matter.

47
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,980
It doesn't matter because
I can let myself go

48
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,530
and we can live in the kitchen.

49
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,393
(soft music)

50
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:06,573
- I'm so damn tight.

51
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,814
- How's buster?

52
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:12,730
- We bred a kick boxer champion.

53
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,813
- Oh, good, we can take
in early retirement.

54
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,873
- Ted.
- Huh?

55
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:18,706
- You love me?

56
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:21,138
- Of course I love you.

57
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,555
- Even like this?

58
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,493
- Especially.

59
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,263
- As always we appreciate
the good work, Malcolm.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,570
If there's no new business,

61
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,550
I suggest adjournment,

62
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,204
so that we might all return
to the task of making money.

63
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,820
(men chuckling)

64
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,071
All in favor.

65
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,904
- [Men] Aye.

66
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:45,737
- Opposed.

67
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,020
This meeting is adjourned.

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,684
- Thank you, son, for your presentation.

69
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,604
You did a terrific job.

70
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:53,437
- We're a good team.

71
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:54,632
- I'm very proud of you.

72
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,932
Listen would you see
that Charlotte gets this.

73
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,580
Carter, before you leave,

74
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,425
I have something I'd
like to share with you.

75
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:04,758
- Oh, thank you.

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,365
- I thought you had quit.

77
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,330
- He did.

78
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,920
- Don't start sounding like your mother.

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,143
This is an auspicious
occasion, my third grandchild.

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,840
- I suppose that means you'll
be looking for another raise.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,330
- Well, you're lucky, Mr. Hughes.

82
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,800
This time I'm just the uncle.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
- No, this is Veronica's it's her first.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,260
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

85
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,747
Well, congratulations to you both.

86
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:27,850
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

87
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,683
- Boy or girl?

88
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:29,790
- Well, we don't know yet.

89
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,800
It's not expected for another week or two.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,340
- You're jumping the gun, aren't you?

91
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,870
- Well, the full board doesn't meet

92
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,930
for another three months,

93
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,180
and by then the kid will
be entering Harvard.

94
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,910
- Full scholarship no doubt.

95
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,360
- There better be we're
in a recession, you know.

96
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,630
- Come on.

97
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,150
Aren't you gonna offer me one of those?

98
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,060
- You know how much these things cost?

99
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,260
- That's why I want one.

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,490
- JD, what are you doing hanging out?

101
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,750
Give Mack a hand with those two by fours.

102
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,583
- Charlie.

103
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,416
- We haven't got all day.

104
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,249
- Charlie.

105
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,082
- Ladies, ladies.

106
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,680
What do you want from me?

107
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,170
We're doing the best job we
can under the circumstances.

108
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,370
- Charlie, you're making
decisions about materials

109
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,830
without consulting us.

110
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,800
- We couldn't get copper.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
We got galvanized sheet metal.

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
- It rusts out.
- Works just as well.

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,070
They all will rust out eventually.

114
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,670
- Charlie, we expect
copper in this fountain

115
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,060
because it lasts longs.

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,220
With galvanized sheet metal

117
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,450
it's gonna rust out in no time.

118
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,770
You really wanna replace the stuff

119
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,110
in two years instead of 20.

120
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,220
- It's the best galvanized

121
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,200
sheet metal.
- It's wrong, Charlie.

122
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,333
- It's top.
- Wrong.

123
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,760
- What do you want from me?

124
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,230
We're just trying to get the job in

125
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,486
by deadline under budget.

126
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:35,420
(cellphone ringing)
- Great now just

127
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,330
through in correctly and we're all set.

128
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,140
Talk to Joni she has a cost points.

129
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,080
- Hello.

130
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,390
Yeah, she's right here.

131
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,240
It's your mother.

132
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,500
- More advice.

133
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Everybody's a critic, Charlie.

134
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,990
- We couldn't get copper.

135
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,010
- Yes, mother.

136
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,303
I'm in the middle of a
meeting can I call you right--

137
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:54,980
- Darling, I just wanted to
remind you about the vitamins.

138
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,160
You know how important they are.

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,650
I was reading this article.

140
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,330
- Yes, thank you, mother
I'm already taking them.

141
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,220
Now I've really gotta.

142
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,090
- I know, dear, you're busy as usual.

143
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,850
Just don't push too hard

144
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,620
for the baby's sake if nothing else.

145
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,000
- Bye, mother.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,050
I'll call you later.

147
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,353
I have really got to go.

148
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:13,890
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.

149
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,940
- Charlie has agreed to replace
the materials as ordered.

150
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,430
Take the cost over on
that out his own pocket.

151
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,263
Honesty lives.

152
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,960
- Stupidity lives.

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,440
Any ways, we'll stay in closer touch

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,630
from here on in, okay?

155
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,330
- Great, listen guys I've got to get to

156
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,690
an appointment in about five minutes.

157
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,523
- I thought we had nothing--

158
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:30,040
- I was wrong, sorry, take care, Charlie.

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,873
- See you later.

160
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:32,230
- Excuse me, I had some other things--

161
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,923
- This is it, Joni, the
real thing I know it is.

162
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,650
- Why didn't you say so?

163
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,660
- Are you crazy.

164
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,100
Charlie Singleton thinks
women belong in the kitchen.

165
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,659
Today we made progress.

166
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:43,492
You think I'm gonna give it up

167
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:45,100
by reminding him that women have babies.

168
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,190
- Now you are the back
bone of the labor force.

169
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,470
- Don't make me laugh.

170
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,070
- Come on.

171
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,903
Just relax.

172
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,050
Start breathing in, okay, good.

173
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,493
Alright breathe, breathe.

174
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,018
- [Ted] Welcome to paradise.

175
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,351
Welcome to the modern world.

176
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,347
- I got her.

177
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:15,264
I got her.

178
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:19,470
(telephone ringing)

179
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,080
- Hello, you have reached

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,740
the hospital room of Jacqueline Ricci.

181
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,033
We're resting right now.

182
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,253
- This is your grandfather speaking.

183
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,600
- Malcolm, what a surprise.

184
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,750
We haven't heard from you and
Clair for at least an hour.

185
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,380
- I cannot be responsible
for my wife, Ted.

186
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,230
That's something you yourself
will discover someday.

187
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,120
Actually, I just wanted to talk to

188
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,350
my daughter alone for a couple of minutes

189
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,030
while my wife is at
some committee meeting.

190
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,820
- Um, she's resting right now.

191
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,380
She'll call you back in about 15 minutes.

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,350
- Relax will ya I'm babysitting Christy.

193
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,700
Let me just say a quick hello to her,

194
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,720
and then I'll speak to her
tomorrow from the office.

195
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,553
Thank you, Ted.

196
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:54,386
- All right.

197
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,230
- Hi, dad.

198
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,430
- Hi, sweetheart.

199
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,057
I won't keep you I just
wanted to say that...

200
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,477
I just wanted to tell ya that I love you,

201
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,123
and you're still my little girl.

202
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,240
Goodnight, sweetheart.

203
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,468
- Goodnight, daddy.

204
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,907
- You want me to read that to you?

205
00:09:29,907 --> 00:09:30,740
- Uh-huh.

206
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,100
- Where did you get this book?

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,010
- You gave it to me, grandpa.

208
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,713
- I did I don't remember that.

209
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,701
- Well, hello.
- Hey.

210
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,656
- Hi, Christy.
- Hi.

211
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:48,007
- Hi, Michael.

212
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,664
(people conversing)

213
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,081
- Hey, beautiful.

214
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,180
Where's the baby?

215
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,796
- Outside with Ted.

216
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,083
Put that down we'll get that upstairs.

217
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:58,916
- Yeah.

218
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,016
- There she is.
- There's dad.

219
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,687
- Hi, Malcolm.

220
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,960
- Look at that face she looks
just like you, Veronica.

221
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,210
- Well, I hate to admit
you're right, Clair,

222
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,400
but she does look like her mom.

223
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,590
- [Ted] Yeah, secrets out
it was a virgin birth.

224
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,398
- Well, I think she has Ted's mouth.

225
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,487
- Oh, I don't agree.

226
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,690
- Oh, absolutely not.

227
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,360
- Well, she dances just like
me though no doubt about that.

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,970
- Can I see?
- Sure come on over.

229
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,260
You too, Christy, come on.

230
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,498
Jacqueline, meet your
cousins Michael and Christy.

231
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,337
- Can I touch her?

232
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:35,793
- [Veronica] Sure, but do it very gently.

233
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,381
- She's so little.

234
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,647
- Well, yes, but you were that
little once too, you know.

235
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,393
- Yeah, and so were you.

236
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,870
- Alright, my angel for you.

237
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,110
A family tradition

238
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,935
all my little girls get
horseys, don't they?

239
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,658
(birds chirping)

240
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:56,776
- Wanna see the waterfall?

241
00:10:56,776 --> 00:10:57,609
- [Michael] Okay.

242
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,000
(soft music)

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,120
- Well, why don't I take
our things upstairs.

244
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:10,400
(crickets chirping)

245
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,200
- Tomorrow we'll go
take a look at the boats

246
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,780
on the lake would you like that?

247
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,510
Okay, that's tomorrow's agenda.

248
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,540
Give me a kiss.

249
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,383
Sleep well.

250
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,100
- [Michael] Okay.

251
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,040
- And sweet dreams my angel.

252
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,513
Give grandpa a big kiss.

253
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,050
When we get home on Sunday,

254
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,613
you and I will do something
special all right.

255
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:34,304
All right.

256
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,092
- All right.

257
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:38,092
- Goodnight.

258
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:48,140
(gentle music)

259
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,883
- Ted.

260
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:02,770
- Yeah, Ted, the one who looks
nothing like your daughter.

261
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:04,720
What are you doing?

262
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,012
- I couldn't sleep.

263
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,050
I (stammering).

264
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,733
I was just up here looking for something.

265
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,940
- Anything in particular
maybe I could help?

266
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,440
- It's not important.

267
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,197
- [Ted] Then why are you looking?

268
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,363
- I honestly don't know.

269
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,343
Come on let's go back to bed.

270
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:30,620
- Actually, you know,
as long as we're here.

271
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,453
- Oh, Ted.

272
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,160
- Door is closed your
parents wouldn't hear.

273
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,940
- No, no, come on, come on, don't.

274
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,910
- Veronica.

275
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,305
- What?

276
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,255
- Do you really think she has my mouth?

277
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,013
- Yes, I do.

278
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,185
Let's go to bed.

279
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,185
(crickets chirping)

280
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,820
I don't know ever since
the first day, nothing.

281
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,650
She just won't nurse.

282
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,710
- I understand your
concern, Veronica, I do,

283
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,640
but I've checked her out
entirely and she's just fine.

284
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,060
This is not that usually.

285
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,570
Remember she's learning too,

286
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,620
so I really don't think there's

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,600
anything to worry about for now.

288
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Just keep trying.

289
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,700
I have some brochures over here

290
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,800
if you'd care to read them.

291
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,550
- I don't know it just feels wrong.

292
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,410
- I think V's trying to
take on a little too much

293
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,500
between the baby and the job.

294
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,580
I think you should give it some time.

295
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,540
I'm not worried.

296
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,503
- Well, I am, okay.

297
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,620
Isn't there anything we can do?

298
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,070
- Just give it some time

299
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,120
and I'll see you in two months, bye, bye.

300
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:38,427
- Here.

301
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,500
What's wrong with me I'm so edgy.

302
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,110
I feel so disconnected.

303
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,017
- Hey, I love you, Big V.

304
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,517
(baby cooing)

305
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:59,646
Oh, the baby's horsey.

306
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:03,573
♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♪

307
00:14:03,573 --> 00:14:06,168
(dramatic music)

308
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,918
(engine revving)

309
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,397
Honey, don't let this breast
feeding thing get to you.

310
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,710
It really doesn't matter.

311
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,511
You know I wasn't breast fed as a kid.

312
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,000
It wasn't the done thing.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,950
Doctors actually preferred
formulas then to breast feeding.

314
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,342
- Stop the car.

315
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,390
- [Ted] Huh?

316
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,223
- [Veronica] Stop the car.

317
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:28,383
- What's the matter, what's wrong?

318
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,997
- Just please stop the car.

319
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:31,080
- Okay, okay.

320
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:35,284
(dramatic music)

321
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:36,117
Veronica.

322
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,508
Veronica.

323
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:39,341
Veronica.

324
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:41,799
(car horn honking)

325
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,632
Veronica.

326
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:45,179
Veronica.

327
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:47,047
Veronica.

328
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,547
(baby crying)

329
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,483
(car horn honking)

330
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,771
Veronica.

331
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,305
Look out.

332
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:02,305
(car horns honking)
(tires squealing)

333
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,487
(tense music)

334
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:09,487
(car horns honking)
(breaks squealing)

335
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:15,876
- You crazy.

336
00:15:17,893 --> 00:15:20,460
- I do, I do understand
how important it is to him.

337
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,740
I'm just saying I don't wanna leave

338
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,810
Jacqueline with a babysitter.

339
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,950
- Have you forgotten what the

340
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,200
Preservation Society represents, Veronica?

341
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,850
They've only presented this
award twice in 15 years.

342
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,270
Now every person of
stature in this community

343
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,530
will be in that room to honor your father

344
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,030
at our own country club.

345
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,800
- I'm aware of that, mother.

346
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,170
It's very flattering to dad.

347
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,210
- Your brother's giving
the toast, you know.

348
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,877
- [Veronica] I'm sure he is.

349
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,675
- And what's that supposed to mean?

350
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:49,600
(baby crying)

351
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,610
- Nothing, mother.

352
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,338
Jacqueline's crying and I've
gotta give her, her bottle.

353
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,760
- Alright, all right.

354
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,470
Just call us soon,
Veronica, with good news.

355
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,510
- I will, mother, goodbye.

356
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,233
- Bye.

357
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:08,163
(baby crying)

358
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,003
- You hungry, Jacqueline, huh?

359
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,878
Here, sweetheart, come here.

360
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,381
Come here let's have some food.

361
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,059
Let's have some food.

362
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,559
(baby cooing)

363
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:31,963
Hungry, huh?

364
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:34,288
Here.

365
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:39,984
(baby crying)

366
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,287
(heavy gasping)

367
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:52,442
- What's the matter?

368
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,275
What's the matter?

369
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:54,425
- I can't breathe.

370
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:56,119
I feel like I can't breathe.

371
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,980
- Alright, alright you're okay.

372
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,863
Nightmare again?

373
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,150
It's okay.

374
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,983
Breathe.

375
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,240
What was it the blood?

376
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,200
- I don't know if it's
blood it's just red.

377
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,120
It's just a sea of red so much red

378
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,593
until it's smothering me.

379
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,614
Oh, god it's so awful.

380
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:22,564
- It's all right.

381
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,002
It's all right.

382
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,169
I'll hold you.

383
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,223
It's okay.

384
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,270
I wish I could come into your dream.

385
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,193
I'd protect you.

386
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,053
- Ted, I think I'm losing it.

387
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,041
I'm so nervous.

388
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,601
- You're not losing it.

389
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,950
- I walked out in the middle of traffic.

390
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,100
I could've been killed.

391
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,830
- It's part of that postpartum depression.

392
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,690
- Don't give me that
postpartum depression crap.

393
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,940
This is different I know it is.

394
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,153
- Alright, okay, relax tell me what's--

395
00:17:58,153 --> 00:18:00,480
- If I could relax, it wanna be a problem.

396
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,103
Don't you get it?

397
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,021
- I get it.

398
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:03,854
I get it.

399
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,256
Tell me what you want
I'll do anything you want.

400
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:08,143
What do you want?

401
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:09,393
- I don't know.

402
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,510
- You know I still don't understand

403
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,210
why you couldn't get Mrs. Foley's niece

404
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,970
to sit with Jacqueline?

405
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,960
This is no place for a baby.

406
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,600
- Because, mother, I don't like handing

407
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,560
my new baby over to strangers

408
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,510
and I already told you that.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

409
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,460
I'd like to introduce to Mr. Tom Worth.

410
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,733
- Every once in a while,

411
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,200
the Preservation Society
uses its annual fundraiser

412
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,740
to honor one of its fellow members.

413
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,200
The board felt that one individual

414
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,080
had so distinguished himself
with his efforts toward the

415
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,770
preservation and the restoration
of the city landmarks

416
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,333
that he must be paid tribute.

417
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,680
I turned them down, however.

418
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,260
(audience chuckling)

419
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,520
I suggested that they
honor my father instead.

420
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,970
Who better to introduce Malcolm Worth

421
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,020
than the kid he groomed in his own image.

422
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,340
My father has dedicated himself
to ensuring the security

423
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,060
and the saving of the historical landmarks

424
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,530
and legacies in this city.

425
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,240
He did all this in his spare time

426
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,170
when he wasn't balancing
the ledger at the bank

427
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,520
or when he wasn't tending lovingly

428
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,870
to the needs of his family.

429
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,115
So, dad, congratulations.

430
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:43,282
(audience applauding)

431
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,512
- Oh, thank you, son.

432
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,293
That's very kind of you.

433
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,734
Your check's in the mail.

434
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:10,860
(audience chuckling)

435
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,693
This is indeed an honor to receive this.

436
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:15,980
(baby crying)

437
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,910
Thank you, Jacqueline, my
youngest granddaughter.

438
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,510
She's very proud of the old man.

439
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,870
Ted, you sure you know
how to change diapers.

440
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,070
- I'm learning, grandpa.

441
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,230
- I would like to thank, first of all

442
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,770
my family for their love and support

443
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,123
and patience over the past few years.

444
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,730
We can all be very proud
of what we have achieved

445
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,460
in our city in the last five years.

446
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,530
We've taken some of the great old homes

447
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,119
that were about to fall
down and we have made them.

448
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,360
Thank you, Kathy, I'm
glad you could be here.

449
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,923
- [Clair] This is just lovely.

450
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,070
- I think it's super
that your whole family

451
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,590
turned out for this, Malcolm.

452
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,600
- Yes.

453
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,150
- Well, it was a pleasure to see you all.

454
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,100
And congratulations again.

455
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,650
- Thank you, Winston.

456
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,910
- Bye.

457
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,930
- Whole family except for one
renegade, ungrateful daughter.

458
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,460
- Well, I'm sure she has her reasons, dad.

459
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,040
- Oh, really I wonder what they are.

460
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,420
- Malcolm, do you have my coat check?

461
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,530
- All I'm saying is she's
not here to defend herself.

462
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,050
- Exactly she's not here.

463
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,290
- Hey, hey dad, dad come on now.

464
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,740
It's been a terrific day,

465
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,600
so don't get all charged up on us, okay.

466
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,580
- Well, thank you, Tom for your loyalty.

467
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,754
And Veronica my little girl.

468
00:21:32,614 --> 00:21:34,096
- Don't.
- What?

469
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:34,980
- What's the matter with you, Veronica?

470
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,113
- Nothing, nothing all right.

471
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:36,946
- What, darling?

472
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,630
- Don't, please don't.

473
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,463
- What's up, V?

474
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,600
- I need to get out of here.

475
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,433
- I don't know.

476
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,633
Hold the baby I'll be right back.

477
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,363
Veronica.

478
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,270
Veronica.

479
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,823
V, what happened?

480
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:58,569
What happened?

481
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:03,566
What?

482
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:04,816
- I don't know.

483
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:09,654
I don't know.

484
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,350
- [Becky] It's just a little weird

485
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,450
that's all I'm telling you.

486
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,490
- I just thought it was
time that we talked.

487
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,330
- Talk about what?

488
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,263
- Just in general.

489
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,356
- So what you're taking some
kind of psych course at night

490
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:29,890
you get to the part of sibling guilt?

491
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,110
- That's not fair, Beck.

492
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,160
I haven't exactly heard from you lately.

493
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,430
- No, you haven't.

494
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,780
- So it's a two-way street.

495
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,253
- Alright, you're the one
who took the train down here.

496
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,163
You start.

497
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
- Look, if you're gonna
be a wise ass about this,

498
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,950
I can get right back on the
train and go home, your call.

499
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,883
- Still got that temper, huh?

500
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,853
Sure.

501
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,293
I'm sorry.

502
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,473
It's just a little out
of the blue, you know.

503
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,223
- Yeah, I know.

504
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,610
- Dad missed you at the banquet.

505
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,600
- Oh, I'll bet.

506
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,433
- He did.

507
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,263
Then he...

508
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,740
He just got angry.

509
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,733
- What a surprise.

510
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,810
- Becky, I've been having these dreams,

511
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,400
these nightmares ever
since Jacqueline was born.

512
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,490
- [Becky] Isn't that normal?

513
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,440
- I don't think so.

514
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,010
See it's pretty much the
same dream all the time

515
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,030
only I can't make it out.

516
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,700
But I think that you're
in the dream somehow

517
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,850
even though you're not.

518
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,010
- What do you mean?

519
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,780
- I mean you're there but you're far away

520
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,453
and I can't get to you.

521
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,980
There's this red

522
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,393
like blood only not
really just a lot of red.

523
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,753
- [Becky] Well, maybe
you should talk to your

524
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:57,870
doctor about it.
- Yeah.

525
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,083
Becky, when we were kids,

526
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,473
did we have any favorite stuffed animals?

527
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,520
- Sure, who didn't?

528
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,820
- No, I mean specifically.

529
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,253
Like a stuffed horse.

530
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,190
- You got me.

531
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,023
I blocked most of those years out.

532
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:22,327
You know, they weren't a
lot of fun for me, you know.

533
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,550
- I remember, but I

534
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,860
I don't know why really.

535
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,853
- Well, some other time maybe.

536
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:31,450
I've got a five o'clock shot,

537
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,690
so I'm gonna have to cut this short.

538
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,410
If I had a little bit more notice.

539
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,310
Why don't you call me first next time.

540
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,053
- I will.

541
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,683
Soon.

542
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
I'd like for you to meet Jacqueline.

543
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,860
Maybe come visit?

544
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,693
- Why not.

545
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,783
I gotta fly.

546
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,043
- No, it's okay.

547
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,980
- I'm really sorry.

548
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,270
- No, no it's all right.

549
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,133
I'm glad that we got
to talk even this much.

550
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:03,980
I don't get to the city that often,

551
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,807
and I thought why not, right.

552
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:09,478
- It was good to see you.

553
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,250
- Good to see you too.

554
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:15,959
Bye.

555
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,840
- You're my husband, Ted, not my father.

556
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,185
- You wanna translate that for me?

557
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,467
- It means you can't tell me what to do.

558
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:32,920
- I'm not telling you I'm begging you.

559
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,100
It's not a good idea.

560
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,470
You said yourself the
other night I'm losing it.

561
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,530
Why would you wanna go back to work

562
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,560
and add the extra pleasure?

563
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,870
- Because I need to get out.

564
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,660
I need to get on with my life.

565
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,000
- Oh, right, because you're spending

566
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,980
oh, so much time with
your daughter, right.

567
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,569
- What's that supposed to mean?

568
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:48,650
- You act like you don't want her.

569
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,890
- What because I wanna go back to work?

570
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,420
It's not my fault she won't breast feed.

571
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,340
The doctor said so even you said so.

572
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,950
- I am talking about
basic maternal instincts.

573
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,410
- What about them?

574
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,960
- You don't appear to have any.

575
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,960
- Get out of my sight.

576
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,360
- No, I live here.

577
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,239
Although you may not
have noticed that lately.

578
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,939
Might as well sleep in the garage.

579
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,970
- So that's what this is about?

580
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,220
You're feeling neglected.

581
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,320
- What I'm feeling is that
I don't have a wife anymore

582
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,003
in the house or in my bed.

583
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,673
Where are you?

584
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:27,797
Where the hell are you?

585
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:30,140
(soft music)

586
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,517
- What do you want me to say?

587
00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:33,760
- I want you to tell me what's wrong,

588
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,073
so we can fix it.

589
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,493
(gentle music)

590
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,127
- Is that what you think, Jacqueline

591
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,512
that I don't want you?

592
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,792
You mean everything to me.

593
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:24,870
Everything.

594
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,709
- So, welcome to the wonderful
world of working motherhood.

595
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,040
It's great, isn't it?

596
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,980
- Which we minds me the
last time we ate here

597
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,990
I couldn't get close enough to

598
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,810
this counter to reached carrots.

599
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,083
- Have some of this.

600
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,082
It's been hell without you.

601
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,250
- Oh, why didn't you say so?

602
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,306
I've been on the phone
with you nearly every day.

603
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:48,183
- I didn't wanna worry you.

604
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,850
- Oh, great, saving it
up for one big chat.

605
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,783
- No, one big lunch.

606
00:27:57,493 --> 00:28:00,490
I think if we get all the bids
in by the end of this week,

607
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,931
we can probably finish this
by the end of this month.

608
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:02,764
What do you think?

609
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,140
- Great, compared to motherhood
it's a piece of cake.

610
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,130
Which reminds me do they still have that

611
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,210
white chocolate mousse thing?

612
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,043
- I hope so.

613
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,210
So how are you really?

614
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,760
- I'm driving my husband crazy.

615
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,500
- He's tough he can take it.

616
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,920
I was the same way.

617
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,210
I was so certifiable for three
months after Lilly was born.

618
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,820
It's totally normal.

619
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,590
- So I keep hearing.

620
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,840
- Yeah, but nobody really
understands, do they?

621
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,673
- No.

622
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:32,236
- Is there anything I can do?

623
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,360
- Split the chocolate
mousse thing with me.

624
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:37,769
- Waiter.

625
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,525
(gentle music)

626
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,450
- Veronica, you can't
just show up like this

627
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,523
in an hour's notice.

628
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,481
(gentle music)

629
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,897
"Let's play ride the horsey,"

630
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,420
that's what he would call it.

631
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,593
He would take me into his
study and lock the door,

632
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,883
and there was a couch,

633
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,333
a cold leather couch.

634
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:39,650
It had a blanket,

635
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,823
a big old soft blanket covering it,

636
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,173
and he would do it to me there.

637
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,076
- The blanket.

638
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,165
What color was it?

639
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:02,131
- Red.

640
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,429
- So it was you in my dream.

641
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,577
But how could I know that?

642
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,790
- Who knows you must have seen it sometime

643
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,090
and not known what it was.

644
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,686
"Ride the horsey."

645
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:41,453
- [Veronica] I'm sorry,
Becky, I'm so sorry.

646
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,749
- How could he do that to me?

647
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:45,999
- I don't know.

648
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,390
I don't know it's over.

649
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:52,968
It's all over.

650
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,180
- I really feel bad about this.

651
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,830
My wife knew that we had a
7:30 appointment with you.

652
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,120
I guess she got stuck at the office,

653
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,290
which is the reason we need to hire you

654
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,553
so she can get stuck at
the office more often.

655
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,703
Anyway, she should be here any minute.

656
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:28,160
Can I get you some more coffee?

657
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,610
- No, thank you, that's fine.

658
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:33,664
(crickets chirping)

659
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,893
- Sorry.

660
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,723
- Sorry, that's it.

661
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,223
Sorry end of story.

662
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,127
- Listen, Ted, I'm beat I gotta go to bed.

663
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:51,343
- No, no you listen.

664
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,270
A: You missed an appointment
with a perspective nanny

665
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,320
that was scheduled at your request,

666
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,500
and B: when I called your office,

667
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,573
they told me you went home early.

668
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,360
I didn't hear a word from you.

669
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,690
So I gotta figure either you're
dead on the road somewhere

670
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,370
or what having an affair?

671
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,283
- Is that what you think?

672
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:11,258
- I don't know what to think.

673
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,150
- That I'm having an affair.

674
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,360
- No, I don't think
you're having an affair

675
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,280
but at least it's an explanation.

676
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,450
Where the hell have you been?

677
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,283
- I went...

678
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,240
I can't talk to you when you're this way.

679
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,213
- Fine, that's okay, no, no, no.

680
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:24,670
So what do you wanna do you
wanna play a little Cribbage?

681
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,050
Should we watch some TV,

682
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,320
or you wanna just jump
into bed call it a day

683
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,330
no questions asked?

684
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,310
- That doesn't help, Ted.

685
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,830
- Well, what does really I'd like to know

686
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,420
because I spent my whole term break

687
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,400
taking care of my daughter

688
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,500
so that you could go back to work earlier.

689
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,280
God forbid we should all
spend sometime together.

690
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,330
It's not enough for you what do you want?

691
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,210
I am your husband not the hired help.

692
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,170
- I know, I know.

693
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,193
I am sorry.

694
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,303
I'm sorry I am just
under a lot of pressure.

695
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,960
- Well, how would I know that?

696
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,613
See you don't talk to me anymore.

697
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,040
I can see you going through something.

698
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,030
But wouldn't it make
sense to share it with me?

699
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,340
I mean isn't that why we got married

700
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,640
so that we could ease
the burden a little bit?

701
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,520
- I'm going through something so scary

702
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,620
I can't talk about it.

703
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,430
- [Ted] You can tell me anything, V.

704
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,237
- I can't not this, not yet.

705
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,370
- Then why are we together?

706
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,260
Why did we have a child?

707
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,945
- Oh, Ted, this has nothing to do--

708
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,227
- It has everything to do with it.

709
00:35:31,227 --> 00:35:32,800
- Just stop.

710
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,660
I need to sort this out alone.

711
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,960
Can't you understand that?

712
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:42,607
- No.

713
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,440
No.

714
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:47,890
I gotta get out of here.

715
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,744
You think you can take care
of Jacqueline till I get back

716
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:56,494
or do you want me to call a sitter?

717
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,530
(baby cooing)

718
00:36:17,184 --> 00:36:20,267
(soft lullaby music)

719
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,360
- This isn't gonna be done in time.

720
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,173
Hello.

721
00:36:58,298 --> 00:36:59,720
Where are you?

722
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,553
- Sorry.

723
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,150
I don't think I'm gonna
make a full day, Joni.

724
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,720
You mind if I cut out
early I need to lie down.

725
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,660
- Sure, you know I think you pushed it

726
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,420
a little coming back so soon.

727
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,960
Why don't you take a little more time?

728
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,310
- I needed to be back here.

729
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,033
We actually hired a nanny.

730
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,910
Starts Monday.

731
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,550
- Okay.

732
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,680
Well, have a nice weekend.

733
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,513
- I will.

734
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,713
Ted.

735
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,933
Ted.

736
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,073
- Me.

737
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,213
I'm sorry, honey.

738
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,130
I was trying to be as quiet as I could.

739
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,220
Blame your father for this.

740
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,623
This was his idea.

741
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,750
I love fishing but even the trotter

742
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,630
are a sleep at this time.

743
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,500
Besides, I don't relish
driving an hour and a half.

744
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,360
- Ted, don't go.

745
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,288
- Oh, right.

746
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:01,455
- I'm serious.

747
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,350
- I'm only exaggerating, you know.

748
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,540
I mean once I'm out there
on the river in the boat,

749
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,690
it's all okay.

750
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,310
- Please, don't go.

751
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,860
- Oh, right you want me to call

752
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,380
Malcolm Worth the third at dawn

753
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,220
and tell him that I'm gonna
cancel the fishing trip

754
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,590
that he's planned for
a whole month no way.

755
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,630
- I'm asking you not to go.

756
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,020
- Besides, you know, your
brother's going now too.

757
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,140
It's a whole big thing.

758
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,973
- I don't care.

759
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,140
- What's the matter are you sick?

760
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,933
- No.

761
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,963
I just don't want you

762
00:38:29,963 --> 00:38:32,252
spending time with my father right now.

763
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,840
- I have to.

764
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,673
I want to.

765
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,620
You know I need a break.

766
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,715
Besides, your father and I
we have a good time together.

767
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:42,715
You should be happy.

768
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,322
- Don't talk to me like that.

769
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,620
- Like what?

770
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,290
- Like I'm crazy.

771
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,440
- Well, when you get like this

772
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,990
you know, I think you are crazy.

773
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,100
Hey, it's four o'clock in the morning.

774
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,370
Go back to bed.

775
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,200
- No, not until you deal with this.

776
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,630
- Deal with what?

777
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,500
Some irrational
middle-of-the-night decision that

778
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,840
all of a sudden I shouldn't
go fishing with your father.

779
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,463
What the hell is wrong with you?

780
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,190
I am going, got it.

781
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,303
I'll see you tonight.

782
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:12,995
(glass breaking)

783
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,740
I don't know what to do?

784
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,213
I don't know how to help you.

785
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,023
I think we need some professional help.

786
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,550
'Cause otherwise there's not
gonna be anything left to save.

787
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:42,169
- I'm sorry.

788
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:45,602
I'm sorry.

789
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:08,936
(engine revving)

790
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:43,716
Hi.

791
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,871
- [Ted] What time is it?

792
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,630
- About 4:30.

793
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,140
Where's Jacqueline?

794
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,973
- Nap time.

795
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:56,890
You're home early.

796
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,553
- Yeah.

797
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:00,137
I wasn't feeling well.

798
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,500
What's new, right?

799
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,787
- You said it not me.

800
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,173
- I'm sorry, Ted, I really am.

801
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,670
I love you, you know.

802
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,837
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

803
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,903
If it wasn't for you,

804
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:20,236
I don't know what my life would be like.

805
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,209
(soft music)

806
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:29,331
- Oh, I miss this.

807
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,267
(soft music)

808
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:10,927
(telephone ringing)

809
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,803
- Don't get it.

810
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:16,723
That's what answering machines are for.

811
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,103
I wanna talk.

812
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,274
- Hello, sorry went can't
get to the phone right now.

813
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:27,595
(baby crying)

814
00:43:27,595 --> 00:43:29,571
I guess that's what fathers are for.

815
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,071
(baby crying)

816
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,600
(machine beeping)

817
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,200
- Hi, little girl it's daddy.

818
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,460
I was just thinking about you.

819
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,483
I hope all is well with you.

820
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,773
How's my granddaughter?

821
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,310
I've got my hands full here

822
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,230
babysitting my other little pride and joy.

823
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,063
Here.

824
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,103
Say, hi, Christy.

825
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,270
Come on, darling, say hello
to your Aunt Veronica.

826
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,953
Never mind.

827
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,660
Well, alright we've got to go now.

828
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,583
We'll see you all.

829
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:11,683
- Dad.

830
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,150
- [Malcolm] We're
unavailable at the moment,

831
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,800
but leave a brief message
and we'll return your call.

832
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,800
- Becky, it's me can you talk?

833
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,770
I think something terrible is happening?

834
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,560
- What is it Jacqueline?

835
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,080
- No, not Jacqueline it's...

836
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,620
Oh, god, I think...

837
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,060
I think dad's doing it to Christy.

838
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,893
- [Becky] What?

839
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,220
How do you know?

840
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,113
- I just know.

841
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,580
I mean I don't know for sure.

842
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,123
It's just a feeling.

843
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:04,710
- [Becky] Veronica what I
told you about me and dad

844
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,570
happened a long time about.

845
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,540
I think maybe you're letting
this get out of hand.

846
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,903
- [Veronica] What if I'm not?

847
00:45:11,903 --> 00:45:13,093
What if it's true?

848
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,480
He's spending a lot of time with her.

849
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,080
- It can't be true he's too...

850
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,010
I don't know he's too old.

851
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,996
It's in the past.

852
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:25,700
It happened to me not you.

853
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,013
I've moved on you gotta do the same.

854
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,590
Are you listening to me?

855
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,743
- Yes, I'm listening.

856
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:34,333
- Life goes on, okay.

857
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,803
Like you told me it's over.

858
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:41,390
It's all over.

859
00:45:42,268 --> 00:45:47,078
There's nothing to worry
about anymore it's over.

860
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,661
(gentle music)

861
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,610
- You got my wife's number.
- Yes.

862
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,741
- Doctor's numbers by the phone.

863
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:00,574
- Yes.

864
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:01,820
- I got my beeper you can beep me anytime.

865
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,010
- We'll call, but everything's okay.

866
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:04,859
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

867
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,630
- Okay, okay right.

868
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,933
- Hi, Joan, bye Joan.

869
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:09,905
- Bye.

870
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:11,783
- Thanks for your car.

871
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:12,780
I didn't wanna wait for the Auto Club.

872
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,233
Not today I don't wanna be late.

873
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,290
- Then don't be late.

874
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,350
- Bye, Jacqueline.

875
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:17,183
Olivia.

876
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,410
- You be good for Olivia.

877
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,700
- We'll be just fine, yes, we will.

878
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,667
- She ate.

879
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,500
- Okay.

880
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:29,617
What a morning.

881
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,020
New nanny, Ted's first day back teaching.

882
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,350
When he came downstairs this morning

883
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,580
and found that flat
tire he nearly flipped.

884
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,458
Thanks for picking me up, Joni.

885
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:52,458
- No problem.

886
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,200
Well, you and Ted don't look like

887
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,550
you're ready to kill each other anymore.

888
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,383
Just maim.

889
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,070
That was a joke.

890
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,273
You remember jokes?

891
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,130
What is it Olivia and Jacqueline?

892
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,680
It's gonna be fine.

893
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,730
Woman is a natural.

894
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:22,840
- I know, I know.

895
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,850
- Why do you look like
you just left your baby

896
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,203
with a child molester.

897
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:31,675
- Why would you say that?

898
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:32,508
- What?
- Why in the hell

899
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:34,353
would you say something like
that about a child molester.

900
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:36,153
It's not funny.
- I didn't mean it.

901
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:40,004
Are you alright?

902
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:42,035
- No.

903
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:47,981
- [Joni] Can I help.

904
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:50,593
- I can't talk about it.

905
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:51,426
- Come on.

906
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:57,240
Does it have something to do with

907
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,001
what you and Ted are
going through in therapy?

908
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,280
- We don't need therapy, Joni.

909
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,300
I'm the one with the problem not Ted.

910
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,150
- No, the two of you are married,

911
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,030
which means you got a lot of stuff

912
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,330
you gotta work out together.

913
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,100
- Joni, my father raped my sister

914
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,220
when we were kids repeatedly in our house.

915
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,163
I just found out.

916
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:19,815
- So that's what's been going on with you.

917
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,050
- I don't know what to do.

918
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,260
- Does Ted know?

919
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,093
- No.

920
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,036
- Sweetie, he's your husband.

921
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:28,023
You gotta tell him.

922
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:31,098
- I'm so ashamed.

923
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:35,501
- You gotta tell him.

924
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:36,890
You gotta give him a break.

925
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:39,163
You gotta let him know what's
been going on with you.

926
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:43,034
- I know.

927
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:45,534
(soft music)

928
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,053
- Malcolm Worth.

929
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:49,220
Malcolm Worth.

930
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:53,833
It's unbelievable.

931
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:56,495
Malcolm Worth are you sure?

932
00:48:56,495 --> 00:48:57,828
- Yes, I'm sure.

933
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,260
- It's hard to believe.

934
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,140
But Becky's always been a
little bit on the dramatic side.

935
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,250
You know, all I'm saying is that--

936
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,930
- She's not making it up.

937
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,183
She's telling the truth.

938
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,420
- Why all of a sudden?

939
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,470
- 'Cause she's been hiding it.

940
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,303
Why do you think she never comes home?

941
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,070
- The only reason I'm saying this is

942
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,460
because, you know, thinks get embellished.

943
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,470
You know, I mean when I was a kid

944
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,690
my father was the old
school, a disciplinarian.

945
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,190
You know, the back of the hand, the belt

946
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,107
all that old crap, you know.

947
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:29,940
But never thought about it being abuse.

948
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,670
It's just the way it was.

949
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,970
- Ted, hitting a kid is abuse.

950
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,073
I don't care what culture or day in age.

951
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,960
I mean can you imagine taking a strap

952
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,910
or the back of your hand to Jacqueline?

953
00:49:45,676 --> 00:49:46,509
Can you?

954
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:48,927
- No.

955
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,853
No.

956
00:49:58,324 --> 00:49:59,813
- I don't know what to do.

957
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:01,687
- What can you do?

958
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:04,223
It was 30 years ago it's over.

959
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:09,260
- But it's not over.

960
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,909
I think he's still doing it.

961
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:11,742
- What?

962
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:16,412
- To Christy.

963
00:50:23,907 --> 00:50:25,600
I'm paralyzed.

964
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,120
I can't stop thinking about it.

965
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,883
I just can't let it go.

966
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,300
- [Ted] Nobody's asking you to.

967
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,393
- Oh, Ted, come on you are in a way.

968
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,440
- I just want you to be happy.

969
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,273
- Well, so do I.

970
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,480
I feel like I should
find out about Christy.

971
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,203
- I agree.

972
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,603
- So,

973
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,633
do I confront my brother?

974
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:12,243
My father?

975
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:17,611
(liquid pouring)

976
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:20,673
I feel sick.

977
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,393
Yes, I feel nauseous.

978
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,733
My head is spinning just
like when I was a kid,

979
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:32,566
just like when.

980
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:40,933
(soft music)

981
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,053
I wanna stop it

982
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:54,853
the pain,

983
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:58,450
my pain.

984
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,813
Christy's.

985
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
- How do you know Christy's in pain?

986
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,023
- I can see it.

987
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,440
Now when I look back

988
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,040
and I see her

989
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,540
especially when she's with him,

990
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,803
she has that lonely,

991
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,363
lonely look of fear.

992
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,450
Like she's the one

993
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,913
he's chose to hurt.

994
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,963
It's the most awful feeling.

995
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,093
- Veronica,

996
00:52:39,377 --> 00:52:42,547
how do you know?

997
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:45,320
How do you know what Christy's feeling?

998
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:48,440
How?

999
00:52:50,882 --> 00:52:53,465
(somber music)

1000
00:53:03,706 --> 00:53:05,873
- No, no, no, no daddy no.

1001
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,910
(engine revving)

1002
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:20,445
(soft music)

1003
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,807
(engine revving)

1004
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,810
It's been a week since I've known, and I

1005
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:08,263
I still answer his phone calls.

1006
00:56:10,052 --> 00:56:12,643
I still feel the need
to try and please him.

1007
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,940
I still haven't had the
guts to confront him.

1008
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,630
- Veronica, you're not even sure

1009
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,723
in the legal sense that
he is abusing your niece.

1010
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:29,943
If he is, we have to report it,

1011
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,540
which means you have to be sure

1012
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,970
in your mind about your own experience.

1013
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,623
It's all part of one process.

1014
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,750
- Yes, I know but what I can't figure out

1015
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,863
is why I let it go on.

1016
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,613
- [Walter] Christy.

1017
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:47,446
- Me.

1018
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,260
- Oh, what alternative did you have?

1019
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,226
You were what seven, eight years old.

1020
00:56:52,226 --> 00:56:54,729
- I should have been able to do something.

1021
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:56,062
- What, a child.

1022
00:56:57,968 --> 00:56:58,801
What?

1023
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,133
- I was afraid of the room itself.

1024
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,830
Until the other day when I went back there

1025
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,560
and I realized that it was just a room

1026
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,550
and I could've gotten away.

1027
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,460
I could have runaway.

1028
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,293
- To where?

1029
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:13,723
- Who knows somewhere anywhere.

1030
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,623
Who knows.

1031
00:57:20,889 --> 00:57:22,273
- Is Christy to blame?

1032
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,620
- What.

1033
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,390
- Do you blame your niece?

1034
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:30,103
If indeed this is happening
to her, do you blame her?

1035
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,840
- Of course not, no.

1036
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,823
- Well, then why do you
blame yourself and Becky?

1037
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,970
He was an adult and he was your father

1038
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,273
what possible power could
you have had over him?

1039
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,940
You were no different
then, than Christy is now.

1040
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,190
No different at all.

1041
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,513
- No, we're different Christy and I.

1042
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,113
She has me.

1043
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:10,374
- Are you nuts?

1044
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,470
Where do you come up with this stuff, huh?

1045
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,460
I mean what do you do sit around all day

1046
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,230
watching talk shows.

1047
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,460
I mean dad you're crazy.

1048
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,303
- Tom, it happened.

1049
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,313
It happened to me and Becky.

1050
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,330
- And you both just happen today remember

1051
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:30,390
exactly the same moment in
time because you're so close.

1052
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,825
- No, no Becky has known.

1053
00:58:31,825 --> 00:58:33,650
That's why she's never around.

1054
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,970
- Yeah, Becky, there's a source, boy,

1055
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,570
a woman who up until three years ago

1056
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,020
at the ripe old age of
37 couldn't keep a job

1057
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,040
or stay with a guy for more than a week,

1058
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,010
who in the course of her sordid life

1059
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,860
has ingested more drugs
than a laboratory rat

1060
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,880
and you're gonna believe what she says.

1061
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,450
- Tom, will you keep voice down.

1062
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:52,590
The kids will hear you.

1063
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:53,423
- Oh, yeah, right, Jan.

1064
00:58:53,423 --> 00:58:55,140
It's okay for my sister to walk in here

1065
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,620
telling us their grandfather
raped her when she was eight.

1066
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,692
That's okay for them to hear.

1067
00:58:58,692 --> 00:59:00,580
- Just lower your voice.
- I'm not gonna lower

1068
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,500
my voice not when she comes in here.

1069
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,333
- Tom.
- What.

1070
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,605
- What I really came here
to talk to you about--

1071
00:59:05,605 --> 00:59:09,570
- Wait you mean there's more, Veronica.

1072
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,170
Well, gee, what now?

1073
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,590
You found out mom's a terrorist.

1074
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,630
Dad's running guns for the PLO.

1075
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,553
- Tom, I have reason to believe
that dad's abusing Christy.

1076
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,490
- What are you talking about?

1077
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:27,608
- Okay, one, two.

1078
00:59:29,302 --> 00:59:30,135
One, two.

1079
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,623
Okay, do you have any aces?

1080
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,903
One.

1081
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,580
You don't then go fish.

1082
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,810
Here you go.

1083
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,643
- Hi, sweetie.

1084
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,476
- Hi.

1085
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:46,650
- Aunt Veronica just wanted
to stop by for a minute.

1086
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,358
She can't stay long.

1087
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:50,670
- Hi, Christy, how you doing?

1088
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,600
- Good, how's the baby?

1089
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,163
- Oh, she's fine.

1090
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,700
You know I know that
she would just love it

1091
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,897
if you'd come by and play
with her would you like that?

1092
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:01,920
- Can we?

1093
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,213
- Sure, sometime soon.

1094
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,533
- How long will she be a baby?

1095
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,793
- For a while you've got time.

1096
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,140
Listen how would you like it

1097
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:18,233
if grandma and grandpa came with you?

1098
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:26,893
No.

1099
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,993
- Why not, Christy?

1100
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,643
- So, what are you playing?

1101
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:49,770
- School I'm teaching her to play Go Fish.

1102
01:00:50,443 --> 01:00:52,410
- Oh, that's your best game.

1103
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:53,653
You always beat me.

1104
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,390
- I beat daddy too.

1105
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,243
- Yep, it's true.

1106
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:02,050
- And you even beat grandpa
when you play it with him,

1107
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,533
and he's good at games.

1108
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:12,450
So, what's your favorite
game in the whole world

1109
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,053
besides Go Fish?

1110
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,780
- Swings at the park.

1111
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,883
- Oh, I knew that.

1112
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,843
'Cause you like to go so high.

1113
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,653
And what's your least favorite?

1114
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,160
Oh, come on you can't fool me.

1115
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,010
If you have a best favorite game,

1116
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,010
you have to have a least favorite right?

1117
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,787
You can tell me, you know.

1118
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:51,313
No matter what it is you can
always tell mommy and daddy.

1119
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:02,263
It's okay to tell I promise.

1120
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,473
So what is it?

1121
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:14,480
- I hate the horsey

1122
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,503
with grandpa.

1123
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:29,890
- You know if you just telephoned,

1124
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,630
I could've arranged to
have lunch with you,

1125
01:02:31,630 --> 01:02:34,530
but as it is I've gotta
be at the Athenaeum

1126
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,930
in a meeting at 2:30,
well, 3:00 if I stretch it.

1127
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,640
- It's alright, mother,
I don't need lunch.

1128
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,563
I just wanted to talk.

1129
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,790
- Everything alright at home, Ted, baby?

1130
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:46,623
- Fine.

1131
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,853
It's me I wanted to discuss actually.

1132
01:02:52,427 --> 01:02:57,427
- Oh, so now we go into a
discussion instead of a talk.

1133
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,420
Well, that sounds serious have some tea.

1134
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,253
- No, thanks.

1135
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,070
- Mother, when we were kids,

1136
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:08,980
you were out of lot, right?

1137
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,950
- Veronica, if this is
gonna be one of these

1138
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,820
mother/daughter sessions
where you inform me

1139
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,250
that I neglected you as a child,

1140
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,350
I have to tell you my conscience is clear.

1141
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,630
Martha Richards has just gone through

1142
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,080
a similar thing with Catherine.

1143
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,680
She's 45 years old for God's sake.

1144
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,730
- Would you listen to me, mother.

1145
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,113
For once just listen.

1146
01:03:31,483 --> 01:03:33,890
(soft music)

1147
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:37,563
You did neglect us but you know that.

1148
01:03:39,694 --> 01:03:41,444
You were never around but that's...

1149
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:45,310
That's not the point.

1150
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,633
It's what happened while you
were gone that's at issue.

1151
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,030
- And what was that?

1152
01:03:57,253 --> 01:03:59,327
(soft music)

1153
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:01,770
- Did you ever notice
that daddy treated us

1154
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,493
Becky and me

1155
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,073
differently?

1156
01:04:10,244 --> 01:04:12,708
- No.

1157
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,658
I don't know what you're talking about.

1158
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:17,980
This is not the time
to discuss this, honey.

1159
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,823
- Daddy raped us, mother,

1160
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,166
repeatedly

1161
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:31,089
when we were small
children and you were away.

1162
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:36,559
Did you hear me?

1163
01:04:37,514 --> 01:04:39,097
- Yes, I heard you.

1164
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,520
- That's it.

1165
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,570
You're walking away that's your response.

1166
01:04:52,665 --> 01:04:57,050
My god, mother, what is wrong with you?

1167
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:59,100
- Nothing's wrong with me.

1168
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,660
I am respectful of your father.

1169
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,030
I will not give one iota of credence

1170
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:08,070
or attention to such vile
accusations as you've made.

1171
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,500
Whatever mental torture

1172
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,360
you're putting yourself through, Veronica

1173
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,440
as a result of whatever
fashionable therapeutic analysis

1174
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,680
you happen to be going
into, it's your business.

1175
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,343
I don't have to be a part of it.

1176
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:20,070
- But you do, mother.

1177
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:22,210
If you knew about it and
you allowed it to happen,

1178
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,630
then you are just as sick as he is.

1179
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,530
- All I ever observed was your
and your over-sexed sister

1180
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:31,800
flirting madly with every man
who set foot in this house

1181
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,202
including your own father.

1182
01:05:33,202 --> 01:05:35,140
(telephone ringing)

1183
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,490
- Mother, we were children.

1184
01:05:37,953 --> 01:05:40,730
(telephone ringing)

1185
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,563
- [Clair] Hello.

1186
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,803
Christy, oh, my god.

1187
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,330
I'm coming right over.

1188
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,163
- What happened?

1189
01:05:51,163 --> 01:05:52,200
- It was your brother.

1190
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,100
You evidently spread your vile

1191
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,430
poison over at his house yesterday.

1192
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,610
- What about Christy.

1193
01:05:57,610 --> 01:05:59,381
- She's runaway.

1194
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,464
- Oh, my god.

1195
01:06:02,409 --> 01:06:05,864
- [Christy] No, way I
don't wanna come down.

1196
01:06:05,864 --> 01:06:07,933
Daddy, make them go away.

1197
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:09,955
- Oh, my god, Christy.

1198
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:12,730
- Christy, honey, please talk to me.

1199
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:16,730
- Christy, whatever's wrong
we're gonna fix it, okay.

1200
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,410
I promise everything
is gonna be just fine.

1201
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:19,970
Mommy and daddy are gonna fix everything.

1202
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:20,803
- Honey, stay right where you are.

1203
01:06:20,803 --> 01:06:21,636
- Will you stay out of this please.

1204
01:06:21,636 --> 01:06:23,291
- I will not stay out of this.

1205
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:24,124
- Please.

1206
01:06:24,124 --> 01:06:25,791
- Mommy, I'm afraid.

1207
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,523
- [Janet] Why are you afraid now, Christy.

1208
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:32,339
- It hurts.

1209
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:34,089
- [Janet] What hurts?

1210
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:36,635
- The game.

1211
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,433
- What game, honey?

1212
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,950
- Ride the horsey it hurted me so much.

1213
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,643
I don't wanna play it anymore.

1214
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:49,763
I don't wanna play.

1215
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,970
- Honey.

1216
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,803
Honey.

1217
01:06:56,257 --> 01:06:58,680
Honey, if I can promise you

1218
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,497
that grandpa will never hurt you again.

1219
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:01,957
- [Male] Watch you step there, sir.

1220
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:04,698
- And that he'd never play
that game with you ever again,

1221
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:08,207
would you come down and come
back home with us, honey?

1222
01:07:08,207 --> 01:07:09,840
- But he'll get mad at me?

1223
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,680
- No, no honey he won't.

1224
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,040
Look I'll talk to him, all right.

1225
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,603
He'll listen to me he's my dad.

1226
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,090
I listen to you don't I, sweetie?

1227
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,855
I'm listen to you right now.

1228
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,980
I promise you I'm gonna fix it

1229
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:28,930
so that you never have to play
that stupid game ever again.

1230
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,133
Okay.

1231
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:33,893
- Okay.

1232
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:36,960
- Okay, now is it alright
if I come over there,

1233
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,293
and get you so that we can go home?

1234
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,930
- [Male] Take it slow, sir.

1235
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:42,763
Take it slow.

1236
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:44,563
- Okay.

1237
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:49,383
Hold on tight, honey.

1238
01:07:49,383 --> 01:07:50,663
- [Male] Take your time.

1239
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:53,312
(board breaking)

1240
01:07:53,312 --> 01:07:54,310
(people gasping)

1241
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,810
- Grab the board, grab the railing.

1242
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:56,643
- He's alright.

1243
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,470
- [Male] That's it.

1244
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:59,970
- I'm alright, honey.

1245
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,470
I'm okay just step, just step.

1246
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,964
Alright I got you, sweetheart.

1247
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:06,877
I got you, you're safe.

1248
01:08:06,877 --> 01:08:09,040
You're safe, Christy, I promise you.

1249
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,853
With all my heart you're safe.

1250
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,290
I love you sweetie.

1251
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,600
- [Male] Don't try to
come back with the girl.

1252
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:21,205
We'll come to you.

1253
01:08:22,952 --> 01:08:25,535
(somber music)

1254
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:51,857
(screen door squeaking)

1255
01:08:51,857 --> 01:08:54,164
- Clair, where have you been?

1256
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:56,240
What's going on are the kids alright?

1257
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,220
- Malcolm Worth, sir?

1258
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:59,380
- Yes, I am what the
hell is going on here.

1259
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,440
- You're under arrest for
the rape of Christine Worth.

1260
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,940
You have the right to remain silent.

1261
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,057
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1262
01:09:07,057 --> 01:09:08,770
You the right to talk to a lawyer.

1263
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,308
- Clair, call the lawyer.

1264
01:09:10,308 --> 01:09:11,141
- [Clair] I will.

1265
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:11,974
- [Officer] If you want a lawyer before

1266
01:09:11,974 --> 01:09:13,093
or during questioning.

1267
01:09:13,093 --> 01:09:14,419
- Oh, Malcolm.

1268
01:09:14,419 --> 01:09:15,252
- [Officer] One will be appointed

1269
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:17,585
to represent you at no cost.

1270
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,480
- I don't intend to sell
you a bill of goods.

1271
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,390
The situation you've
all found yourselves in

1272
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,370
is undoubted painful,

1273
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,123
so I want to be real clear
about what lies ahead.

1274
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,973
We've got two distinct cases here.

1275
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,610
With regard to Becky and Veronica,

1276
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:38,330
there's a very real possibility that

1277
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,630
we'll never even got
as far as a court room

1278
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,400
because of limitation statutes.

1279
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,250
This all happened quite sometime ago.

1280
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:48,650
- I read somewhere that if you can show

1281
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:51,533
a present effect that you can
sometimes get around that.

1282
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,960
- Sometimes is the
operative word so is effect.

1283
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,090
It can get pretty dicey.

1284
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,520
Now the fact that both of you

1285
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,363
want to cooperate can only help.

1286
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:08,030
As far as the case with
Christy, I'm going to be honest.

1287
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,990
I'll need everyone's cooperation

1288
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,753
to bring a successful prosecution.

1289
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,913
- What kind of cooperation?

1290
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,120
- A man like your father

1291
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,150
is not likely to roll over and play dead

1292
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:24,120
neither are his high-priced lawyers.

1293
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,830
If Christy is our only witness,

1294
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:28,640
it will be more difficult.

1295
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,040
- But she is the only witness.

1296
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,500
Nobody else was ever present.

1297
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,290
- Right, but what happened to

1298
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,890
Becky and Veronica is so similar

1299
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:39,750
down to the phrase, "Ride the horsey"

1300
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,420
that their testimony as well as yours

1301
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,850
and Janet's as to what
your daughter told you

1302
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,970
how she behaved around her father etcetera

1303
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,093
will all be essential
in convincing a jury.

1304
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,813
- What if...

1305
01:10:53,346 --> 01:10:55,096
What if we decide not to prosecute?

1306
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:59,010
- You don't really have that option.

1307
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,670
This is not technically
a crime against Christy.

1308
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,283
It's a crime against the state,

1309
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,143
and it's up to my office to
decide to prosecute or not?

1310
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,200
- And when will you decide if you want to?

1311
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,643
- I've already decided.

1312
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,723
I want to.

1313
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,980
Having intercourse with
a five year old child

1314
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,950
is a heinous crime any way you slice it.

1315
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:28,390
My only question is whether
I've got a strong enough case

1316
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,810
to proceed should you all
decide not to work with us

1317
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,193
in which instance I may proceed any way.

1318
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,020
I think Malcolm Worth is a dangerous man.

1319
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:39,520
- Alright, alright hold on.

1320
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,980
- Mr. Worth, I know this
is difficult to hear.

1321
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,890
But I am involved on a daily basis

1322
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,380
with children who are sexually

1323
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,870
and physically abused by adults.

1324
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,373
It ain't pretty as they say.

1325
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,490
I know a thing like this
can tear a family apart.

1326
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:55,710
But truth be told the damage

1327
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,603
has already been done to all of you.

1328
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:01,560
The point now is to protect this child

1329
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:05,230
and any other child from
suffering the same abuse.

1330
01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:06,063
So,

1331
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:10,400
I am asking for cooperation

1332
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:15,453
from all of you.

1333
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:21,590
Why don't you use our
conference room to discuss it.

1334
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,443
- We can't just slap
his hand and walk away.

1335
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:41,470
I think we should cooperate.

1336
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,810
- What do we get out
of it in the long run?

1337
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,773
Revenge.

1338
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,143
You think that's worth it?

1339
01:12:49,143 --> 01:12:51,130
- This has nothing to
do with revenge, Becky.

1340
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:51,963
It's like she said.

1341
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:52,796
It's a heinous crime.

1342
01:12:52,796 --> 01:12:53,980
It could happen again.

1343
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,130
- So what do you think dad's gonna

1344
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,940
hang around the school yards.

1345
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,710
We just keep him away
from Christy that's all.

1346
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,640
- We have a daughter too, Tom.

1347
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,400
- Yeah, so what are you saying?

1348
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,120
- I'm saying it's not
as simple as you think.

1349
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,640
- Well, sure he's not your father.

1350
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,270
- Well, he's my father.

1351
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,500
- Excuse me, but we owe this to Christy.

1352
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,960
I'm not gonna let her go
through this by herself.

1353
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,740
What's wrong with you, Tom?

1354
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,870
- What's wrong.

1355
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,653
What kind of a son testifies
against his father?

1356
01:13:19,653 --> 01:13:21,100
What's kind of a son would I be?

1357
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,960
- What kind of a father
would you be if you didn't?

1358
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,860
- Tom, you were the first one
down at the police precinct.

1359
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,143
Remember how you felt?

1360
01:13:31,164 --> 01:13:32,770
If we don't do this for Christy now,

1361
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:35,683
we're just as guilty
as dad, maybe more so.

1362
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,982
- Maybe this was not the
best place for us to come.

1363
01:13:47,982 --> 01:13:49,950
- It doesn't matter, mother.

1364
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,783
Thank you.

1365
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:54,301
- Thanks.

1366
01:13:57,597 --> 01:14:01,280
I'm told that you still haven't

1367
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,173
decided whether or not to go
through with this prosecution.

1368
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,493
I'm asking you not to.

1369
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:10,510
- It's not up to me, mother.

1370
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,693
It's up to the DA.

1371
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:18,230
- Do you know that the bank

1372
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:21,110
has asked your father
to take early retirement

1373
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:22,703
starting next month?

1374
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,960
Do you know that this country club

1375
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,970
where he's been a member for over 30 years

1376
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,453
has not invited him back?

1377
01:14:31,962 --> 01:14:34,000
- You still don't get it do you?

1378
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,100
- Get it, I'm living with it.

1379
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,600
- You think this is about dad,

1380
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:41,933
about what happens to dad.

1381
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:46,260
What about Christy, what
about five-year-old Christy?

1382
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,770
You think she deserves to suffer?

1383
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:48,670
- No.

1384
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:51,583
No, I do not and I blame you.

1385
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,520
A five-year-old child does not come up

1386
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,330
with vile accusations
such as this on her own.

1387
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:00,130
She has to be coached.

1388
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:00,963
- Coached.

1389
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,970
You don't believe that, mother.

1390
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:05,960
Why would I do that?

1391
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,340
Why would I do something like that?

1392
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:09,870
- It is revenge, Veronica,

1393
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,773
pure and simple and it's perverse.

1394
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,883
- What dad did to me and
Becky was bad enough,

1395
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,060
but now for you to twist things around

1396
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,503
that's what's perverse.

1397
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,313
- Your father's an old man, Veronica.

1398
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:33,890
It is in your power to ruin,

1399
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,733
devastate what's left of his life.

1400
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:41,503
But I must ask you where
is the joy in that?

1401
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:57,520
- It's late do you wanna go to bed?

1402
01:15:58,770 --> 01:15:59,603
- Huh?

1403
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,883
- Wanna go to bed?

1404
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:12,550
- No, you go ahead, honey.

1405
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,550
I've got some more I've gotta read here.

1406
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,640
- You don't have to.

1407
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,383
You're not the lawyer.

1408
01:16:18,383 --> 01:16:20,060
It's not your job you don't have to.

1409
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,433
- What are you saying, Ted?

1410
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:26,527
- Never mind I'll see you in the morning.

1411
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,010
- Ted, come on please.

1412
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,150
Don't do this.

1413
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:34,633
- I'm very sorry for what happened to you,

1414
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,980
and I wish I could make it
all go away, make it better.

1415
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,310
But we have a life together.

1416
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:42,863
We have a family of our own,

1417
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:47,850
and it would be nice if
we could get back to it.

1418
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,810
Move on that's all.

1419
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:50,643
- Move on.

1420
01:16:50,643 --> 01:16:51,476
- Yeah.

1421
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:53,223
- Ted, I am stuck in it.

1422
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,150
You think now because it's out in the open

1423
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,880
it gets any easier.

1424
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,203
If anything it gets worse.

1425
01:17:02,136 --> 01:17:03,440
It didn't happen to you.

1426
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,503
- That's right, didn't happen to me.

1427
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,440
Other things happened to me.

1428
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,540
- Yes, but what what happened
to you didn't make it

1429
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:13,093
impossible for you to
function normally this does.

1430
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,633
Ted, I'm sorry.

1431
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:23,653
I wanna come back to our life,
to our marriage, Jacqueline.

1432
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,703
It's all I can think about some days.

1433
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,910
It just seems so far away.

1434
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,560
- We're right here.

1435
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,393
We're right here.

1436
01:17:34,393 --> 01:17:36,379
- I know you are.
(telephone ringing)

1437
01:17:36,379 --> 01:17:39,130
- Hello, sorry, we're unable
to take your call right now.

1438
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,797
Machine will get it.

1439
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:45,010
- [Clair] It's mother.

1440
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:46,820
We're at the hospital.

1441
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,093
Dad's had a heart attack.

1442
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,293
- It's me what happened?

1443
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,013
Of course, tonight.

1444
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:04,953
- How bad?

1445
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,130
- They don't know.

1446
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,653
- What?

1447
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:16,778
- She asked me if I was satisfied.

1448
01:18:16,778 --> 01:18:19,195
(soft music)

1449
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:27,897
- [Female] Dr. Gerald Steiner
please call the OR two.

1450
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:31,397
Dr. Gerald Steiner please call the OR two.

1451
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,680
Dr. Peterson radiology.

1452
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,597
Dr. Peterson radiology.

1453
01:18:43,173 --> 01:18:45,590
(soft music)

1454
01:18:58,603 --> 01:19:01,436
(heavy breathing)

1455
01:19:14,586 --> 01:19:17,820
- [Female] Dr. Copeland,
Dr. Robert Copeland.

1456
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,960
- I forget if you said real sugar or fake.

1457
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,000
- Neither.

1458
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,833
- I got both.

1459
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,013
- Is there milk?

1460
01:19:26,338 --> 01:19:27,280
- I thought you said black.

1461
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,270
I'm sorry I'll go get some.

1462
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:30,187
- No, no, it's okay this is fine.

1463
01:19:30,187 --> 01:19:31,925
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1464
01:19:31,925 --> 01:19:32,758
- Okay.

1465
01:19:34,846 --> 01:19:37,803
- [Female] Dr. Coleman, Dr. Sarah Coleman

1466
01:19:37,803 --> 01:19:40,220
please call the surgery unit.

1467
01:19:47,284 --> 01:19:50,823
- You know, I've been thinking.

1468
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:57,920
Seeing dad like this, you
know, with the tubes and all

1469
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:02,870
I just feel like this is all our fault.

1470
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,580
I know what you're gonna say,

1471
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,790
and there's a part of me that just wants

1472
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:09,053
to see the old bastard suffer and die.

1473
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,200
But then there's another part

1474
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:16,703
that knows he's just sick mentally.

1475
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:23,393
I just feel like maybe
we've punished him enough.

1476
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,453
- Punished him.

1477
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,573
Tom, it's not our fault.

1478
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,670
This isn't about punishment.

1479
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,823
It's about recognition.

1480
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,470
I think we have to go through with this

1481
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:39,873
or where will it stop.

1482
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:45,390
- Veronica, look I...

1483
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:50,123
I am truly sorry for what
happened to you and Becky.

1484
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:54,200
I mean...

1485
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,490
I mean I blame myself.

1486
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:56,750
- You had nothing to do with this.

1487
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,799
- Will you let me finish please?

1488
01:20:58,799 --> 01:20:59,853
I mean where was I?

1489
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,180
Why didn't I see?

1490
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:04,163
I'm your brother.

1491
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,240
I'm your guy's older brother.

1492
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,790
I was supposed to look out for you two.

1493
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:08,927
- You were just a kid.

1494
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:10,683
- But what about now, huh?

1495
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:15,880
I mean how could I let
this happen to Christy.

1496
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,714
I'm her father for god's sake.

1497
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:19,781
- Oh, Tom.

1498
01:21:19,781 --> 01:21:20,614
Oh, Tom.

1499
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:26,680
Why should I be the one to
feel the anguish over this?

1500
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,513
I lived it.

1501
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,433
I lived with it.

1502
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,960
And now I have to live with the knowledge

1503
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,483
that I'm destroying his life.

1504
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:36,380
Why because I made it all up?

1505
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,206
- Is that what you think
that you made it up?

1506
01:21:40,206 --> 01:21:43,380
- No, no I just can't
let myself off the hook.

1507
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,430
- [Walter] What hook?

1508
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:48,603
- That I should have never
brought this out in the open.

1509
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:52,560
- Well, what was this alternative

1510
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,760
to let your niece be permanently injured

1511
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,185
the way you and Becky were?

1512
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,907
- No, no, Walter I know that.

1513
01:21:57,907 --> 01:21:59,050
I am just angry.

1514
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:02,250
I am just so damn angry I could scream.

1515
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,530
Who are you so angry at
by the way, yourself?

1516
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,363
- No.

1517
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:08,748
My father.

1518
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,680
- Then maybe it's time you told him.

1519
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,030
- We have nothing to say to each other.

1520
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,033
- Yes, we do.

1521
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,050
- My lawyer's handling this.

1522
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,317
You can face it with him.

1523
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:52,383
- No, daddy.

1524
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,730
I have to face this with you.

1525
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:58,550
- What the hell do you want from me?

1526
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,590
- An explanation.

1527
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:00,423
- For what?

1528
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:03,303
- An admission.

1529
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,753
An apology.

1530
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,133
Something.

1531
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:11,763
Anything.

1532
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,920
- I have nothing to apologize for.

1533
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,343
I've done nothing to you.

1534
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,810
If you insist on going forward

1535
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:21,380
with these trumped up charges--

1536
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:24,170
- You raped me, daddy,
why did you do that?

1537
01:23:26,257 --> 01:23:28,313
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1538
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:32,093
- I looked up to you.

1539
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,710
Why did you wanna hurt me?

1540
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,693
Did you hate me that much?

1541
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,423
- Hate you.

1542
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:45,163
I loved you.

1543
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,203
Both of you.

1544
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:51,123
You were all I had.

1545
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:55,073
My little girls.

1546
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,603
You were my pride and joy.

1547
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,603
- Don't you know what you did to us?

1548
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,423
- I don't understand you, Veronica,

1549
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,930
and I want you to stop this.

1550
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:19,790
- I can't.

1551
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:22,540
- Well, then you can consider
me your father no longer.

1552
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,990
- You stopped being my father

1553
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:31,043
the first time you forced
me to have sex with you.

1554
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:35,683
- Veronica.

1555
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:45,610
You disappoint me, deeply.

1556
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:46,913
- It won't work, dad.

1557
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:51,013
I'm going to see that you're prosecuted.

1558
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:58,515
- Then you are no longer my daughter.

1559
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,733
- I can understand about Becky.

1560
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,620
I can't believe that you would

1561
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:17,690
actually go through with this,

1562
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:19,920
and Tom is going along with you.

1563
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,853
- Yes, Tom is going along with us.

1564
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:24,106
- Why.

1565
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:28,880
- Because we all feel
that we have to, mother.

1566
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,763
- Oh, that's a load of crap, Veronica.

1567
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:34,970
It is hateful and it is selfish.

1568
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:37,803
It's unnatural and it
is crap, do you hear me?

1569
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,770
Why?

1570
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,360
Why in your sordid little
mind do you believe

1571
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,773
that you have to go through
with this wretched thing?

1572
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:54,920
- So that Becky and I can go on from here

1573
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:57,963
and restore some kind of a life,

1574
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,100
and so that Christy has a chance at one.

1575
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,700
I hope someday you'll understand.

1576
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:10,179
(soft music)

1577
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,180
- I should've gone in with you.

1578
01:26:34,307 --> 01:26:35,953
I couldn't.

1579
01:26:35,953 --> 01:26:36,786
- I know.

1580
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:38,892
It's okay.

1581
01:26:41,022 --> 01:26:42,272
- No, it's not.

1582
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:50,805
It's not okay.

1583
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:53,222
(soft music)

1584
01:26:55,163 --> 01:26:57,560
- I sat on the couch, you know.

1585
01:27:07,484 --> 01:27:09,734
And for the first time ever

1586
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,309
I didn't wanna vomit.

1587
01:27:26,535 --> 01:27:27,785
- It's a start.

1588
01:27:30,687 --> 01:27:31,520
- Yeah.

1589
01:27:33,775 --> 01:27:36,525
(engine revving)

1590
01:27:50,664 --> 01:27:53,164
(baby cooing)

1591
01:28:10,593 --> 01:28:12,877
It's gonna be difficult for a while

1592
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,530
with the trial and all.

1593
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,150
It's not over yet.

1594
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:21,560
Can you stand it?

1595
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,880
- With a good looking woman like you

1596
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,393
and a baby like this I can stand anything.

1597
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:32,471
(soft music)

1598
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,363
There we go.

1599
01:28:38,363 --> 01:28:42,760
Look who's here and it's
time for the bottle.

1600
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,819
Come on here we go.

1601
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:45,652
Up we go.

1602
01:28:54,385 --> 01:28:55,218
- Let me.

1603
01:28:56,978 --> 01:28:58,427
Hi, Jacqueline.

1604
01:28:58,427 --> 01:28:59,677
Hi, sweetheart.

1605
01:29:01,807 --> 01:29:04,069
I wanna try again.

1606
01:29:04,069 --> 01:29:06,736
Come here sweetheart, come here.

1607
01:29:16,362 --> 01:29:17,362
Oh, sweetie.

1608
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:42,498
