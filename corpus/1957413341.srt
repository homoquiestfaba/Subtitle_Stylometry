<i>We hunted you,</i>

7

<i>So, we struck up a truce</i>

11
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,041

between our kind and yours.</i>

12
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,916
<i>We lived in secret,</i>

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,625

you had never really believed.</i>

00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,208
<i>You forgot to be afraid.</i>

15
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,958

17
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,958

than you could ever imagine.</i>

18
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,125
<i>To this day, there are some
who still uphold the truce,</i>

Hey, Grandma.

[Grandma] You came at a good time.

[Benny in English] Yeah? Why's that?

104
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,500
[Grandma in Spanish] I just took out
some flautitas and some empanadas.

[Benny in English] Nice!

106

[Grandma in Spanish] Are you hungry?

[Benny in English] You know it.
[in Spanish] But why do I bother shopping

108
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,250
if you're never
going to cook me a <i>sancoche?</i>

109

You know I don't cook that.

110
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,416

I'm going to buy you a house.

[groans] I don't need
my own home, my love.

What I do need is for you
to finish your studies

113

so you can take care of yourself.

114
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,833

I'm gonna die, and so will you.

So negative. I don't like it.

you could handle it.

No, I told you. This is...

Come on, Jessie,
you're really gonna do me like that?

124
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,875
I need someone to cover the car tonight.

125
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,708
It's about Maria.

126
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, well, I thought I could rely on you!

Yeah, fine, whatever.

128
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,291
Why are you creeping?

129
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,291
If I'd know you was coming through,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

130
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,833
I have to pick up some things,
check in on Grandma.

131
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
- Check in on your punk ass.
- Ha.

132
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Oh, wait a minute. What's this?
Bro, that some gray hairs on your head?

133
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey, I'm serious.
You're getting old, <i>papi.</i>

134
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
- Just wait. It's gonna happen to you too.
- [laughs]

135
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,125
I don't know if you're working tonight,
but maybe we could go to Mario's,

136
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,833
grab a pizza, watch the game.

137
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
[Jay] I got something else tonight.

138
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,500
All right,
then who's covering the car, then?

139
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
[Jay] I had to cancel.
Everyone's booked up.

140
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,166
All right, but you see,
I was thinking, like, what if,

141
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,291
you see, what if I take the car? Right?

142
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
- 'Cause I could use the money.
- No way.

143
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,125
- Why not?
- [Jay] One, you're a bad driver.

144
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,333
Bad… That's bullshit.

145
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
When was the last time
you were west of K-Town?

146
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
Hey, Jay, my man, look,
I am way more responsible

147
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
than all them dudes
you got out there at the depot.

148
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,291
Yeah, except them dudes at the depot,
they got chauffeur's license,

149
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,041
they're insured by the company,
and they actually own a suit.

150
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,875
I… You see, the thing is, though,
Jay, I got a suit. I got a suit, Jay.

That's what it is?

You having some relationship issues?

154
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,041
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me.

155
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I give great advice.
That's what people be saying.

156
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791

- I said don't worry about it.

163
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
All right. Fine, man.
I didn't even… [mumbles]

Yo. You serious?

Man! I'm gonna need me one of these.

169

You can't afford it.

170

509
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,500
- What… what did you do?
- Max?

510
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,958
Hey, Max. You okay?

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,500
[in deep voice] Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I'm living my best life.

512
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
Are you crazy? Is he…

513
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,666
- Is he...
- He's dead. Yes, Daniel.

514
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,125
Yes, he's dead.

515
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,291
I killed him.

516
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,041
- No, you can't do this.
- [Zoé] No?

517
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,833
We're protected. This place is protected!

518
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,791
You're protected?
How protected do you feel right now?

519
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,750
Hmm? [laughs]

520
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,041
Blaire, finish your drink.
We're running behind schedule.

521
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,791
- Hey. You stupid bitches.
- [Zoé] Mmm.

522
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,000
They're gonna come after you for this.
The bosses will burn you alive.

523
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
- Oh.
- [Daniel] Yeah.

524
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,791
- You can't kill in here. It's off-limits.
- [laughs]

525
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Oh, are those the rules?

526
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
You can't. You're gonna ruin this place.

527
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,750
Well, that's the point.
No more happy endings.

528
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,416
- [clangs]
- No, wait, hey!

529
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,708
Wait, no, no, no. Don't, please, wait.

530
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,583
You can't kill me.
You can't. What about the truce?

531
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:44,041
- The truce is dead, handsome.
- Wait. Wait. [groans]

532
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:47,666
[Blaire slurping]

533
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,458
[panting]

534
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
Hey, uh, officer, listen. Um, I…

535
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,291
I need… I need your help. I… I got this…

536
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,291
It's an emergency.
There's these two women, right?

537
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,958
- And they're after me and...
- Two women?

538
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,333
- Mm-hmm.
- After you?

539
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah, I've been… I've been driving them
around all night, but I think that's...

540
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,250
Is there anything
you want to tell me about, son?

541
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,791
- No, listen, I'm trying...
- How much have you had to drink tonight?

542
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,333
- I haven't drank anything.
- Any drugs?

543
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,541
- No drugs.
- Weapons on you?

544
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,250
Listen, there's
this secret floor in there, okay?

545
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,541
There's this crazy shit
that's going on in there.

546
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,458
I need you to call backup.
I need you to call everyone, call...

547
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,000
Exactly what'd you see up there?

548
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,333
[panting]

549
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,708
They killed these two guys, all right?
They were drinking their blood, man.

550
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,125
Okay, that's enough.
Put your hands behind your back.

551
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,000
Put your hands behind your back!

552
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey!

553
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
Come on. Take… take me to jail right now.

554
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,041
Get me… get me out of here. [grunts]

555
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,500
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

556
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

557
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,000
- What happens upstairs stays upstairs.
- No. Okay.

558
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,583
- You should know better.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna say...

559
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,625
- Get in the trunk. In the trunk!
- I won't say nothing!

560
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,250
- I'm not gonna say anything!
- Excuse me, Officer Anderson.

561
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,291
You girls.

562
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,250
Yes, us girls.

563
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,833
This kid is saying
you killed two men upstairs.

564
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,041
- That can't be right, right?
- [Blaire] Of course not.

565
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,583
Benny here has no idea what he saw.

566
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,625
Do you, Benny?

567
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,375
We just gave those boys
the best suck they're ever gonna get.

568
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,000
Let him go. He's ours.

569
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,125
[chuckles]

570
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,333
Yeah. Victor know about this?

571
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,958
What do you think, dipshit?

572
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,250
We're just making our collections.
Business as usual.

573
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,416
- Well, I didn't get a call.
- Oh, you didn't get a call?

574
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,333
Maybe you're not important enough
to get a call.

575
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, maybe I should just call Victor now.

576
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,625
[Zoé] Why don't you do that?

577
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:56,750
I'm sure Victor would love to hear
from his favorite little piggy.

578
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,583
[Blaire] Hand him over.

579
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,083
[exhales]

580
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,833
Okay, all right. Fine.

581
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,166
[keys jingle]

582
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,375
[handcuffs click]

583
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,125
[Zoé] Go turn the car around.

584
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,666
Huh? Hey!

585
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,291
No more funny games.

586
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,625
[ominous music playing]

587
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,875
- [clicks]
- [liquid pouring]

588
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,625
[mechanical whirring]

589
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,250
[phone camera clicks]

590
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:29,458
[muffled] Wait! No.
Don't go! Wait! Don't leave!

591
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,125
[engine revving]

592
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,125
[sinister music playing]

593
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
[Zoé and Blaire laughing]

594
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,833
Yeah.

595
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,291
- Yeah, you count this out?
- [both laugh]

596
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,541
[speaking indistinctly]

597
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:15,041
[gulps]

598
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,458
[panting]

599
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,000
[heart beating]

600
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,875
[clicks]

601
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,000
[heart beating rapidly]

602
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,916
[grunts]

603
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,041
Back in the car, driver.

604
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,541
[Benny] Hmm.

605
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,458
[intense music playing]

606
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:07,666
[engine revving]

607
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,958
[music continues]

608
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,375
[somber melody playing]

609
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,125
Don't get up. I know where the bar is.

610
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,375
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm having a drink with my bosses, Eva.

611
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,000
Better make it a good one.

612
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,708
- It's gonna be your last.
- [Victor] I'll keep that in mind.

613
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,666
We told you what would happen
if you stepped foot in Boyle Heights,

614
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,000
and yet, here you are,

615
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,541
being reckless as ever.

616
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,833
Drinking blood cocktails

617
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,250
on white upholstery,
and I'm the reckless one?

618
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,291
[Eva] You need to remember your place,
Victor. You're middle management.

619
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,416
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't call Martin right now.

620
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,125
- Because I've had a change of heart.
- What heart?

621
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,583
I deserve that.

622
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,958
This view never gets old.

623
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,458
Yeah. But now we're gonna have to ruin it
with your dead body.

624
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,750
I should have let her do
what she wanted with you.

625
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,916
I wanted to barbecue you
the moment you fed outside the lines.

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,708
But Grace said that would be impulsive.

627
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,458
I think the word I used was tacky.

628
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,625
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

629
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,458
I know you've never trusted me,
never given me any real power.

630
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,166
But if you hadn't tried
to run me out of my own city,

631
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,666
I wouldn't be seeing so clearly now.

632
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,250
- Are you on something?
- You violated the truce.

633
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,208
It's the one thing that's kept
our kind safe all these years,

634
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,416
and you just pissed on it.

635
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,666
For years we've been told
who to feed on and where

636
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,291
and treating humans
like they're our equals.

637
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,541
It started to feel like a prison.

638
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,625
So I got frustrated
and did something impulsive.

639
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
Should we say

640
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,000
tacky?

641
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,000
[Eva] Tacky?

642
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,500
You fed where you weren't supposed to
and started a war with Jay Perez.

643
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,875
If he comes for us,
Boyle Heights will follow.

644
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,083
Do you like your fancy clothes
and your concrete mansion?

645
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,166
Because if we get exposed,
that all goes away. For all of us.

646
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,125
I know.

647
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,833
I put you two in a terrible position.

648
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,208
Do you think that I don't get frustrated?

649
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:51,208
Do you think that when my pool boy
leaves a leaf in the pool,

650
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,958
that I don't wanna string him upside down
and suck him dry?

651
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,625
But if I pitch a fit every time
somebody pisses me off,

652
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,791
what does that make me?

653
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,958
A man.

654
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,250
Stupid as shit.

655
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
Like I said.

656
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,625
I'm sorry.

657
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,125
No, a ban is a ban.

658
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,208
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that if you want me to reverse it.

659
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,208
You know, forever is a very long time.

660
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
Give it 40, 50 years.

661
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,000
Who knows? Maybe this will blow over,
and you'll be able to come back.

662
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,708
[sighs] Oh, I think you've misunderstood.

663
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm not going anywhere.

664
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,666
In fact, my girls
are down there right now,

665
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,958
ripping your entire network apart
one neck at a time.

666
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,083
So, everything you see belongs to me.

667
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,250
After I kill both of you, of course.

668
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,750
- Martin!
- [feedback squeals]

669
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:54,333
I, uh, think you might
have to speak up a little.

670
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:59,083
[laughs]

671
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,875
[Benny mumbling]
This is not real. This is…

672
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,458
Come on. She's here, then she's there.

673
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:07,625
[muttering]

674
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,625
- You need to calm down.
- Calm? Be calm?

675
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,166
- You want me to calm down?
- Yeah.

676
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,916
- I'm calm.
- Oh, you're calm?

677
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,125

01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,083
[Zoé]<i> I thought you said</i>
<i>you were gonna take care of Jay.</i>

1186
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,208
[Victor] <i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'm on my way to meet Jay.</i>

1187
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,583
<i>Just stopped for a drink.</i>

1188
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:30,541
Okay.

1189
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,750
I don't know. I'm getting worried.

1190
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,750
<i>This night's going sideways.</i>

1191
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,083
We can't stop now. We're nearly done.

1192
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm gonna drain the kid.
I'm gonna smother the grandma,

1193
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,166
and we can hit Venice tomorrow.

1194
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,708
[Victor] <i>We need to clear Venice tonight.</i>
<i>Rocko is too unpredictable.</i>

1195
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,416
If we mess this up,
there will be no tomorrow.

1196
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,750
- [man grunting]
- Venice is the last kill.

1197
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,791
- [man whimpering]
- I know you can do it.

1198
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,625
Just keep a hold of the kid,
and we'll party at dawn.

1199
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,541
The world will be ours, babe,

1200
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,375
just me and you.

1201
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:07,958
[breathes deeply]

1202
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:08,875
Yeah.

1203
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,541
Let's get it done.

1204
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,166
Now,

1205
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
where were we?

1206
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,458
[whispering] It's kind of cool.

1207
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,000
[knife clatters]

1208
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250
Huh.

1209
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,791
All right.

1210
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,333
[hip-hop music playing on speakers]

1211
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,791
This is super cool.

1212
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,333
[chuckles] Yeah, all right.

1213
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,041
You… you can put that down.

1214
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,041
[sighs] Sorry.

1215
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,500
This is all just leftover
from when I was a kid.

1216
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,333
I was gonna get rid of all of this stuff.
I haven't really had the time to upgrade...

1217
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,416
Yes. Did you build all of this?

1218
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,666
Yeah, but you know,
can we just maybe turn this down...

1219
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,791
Mm-mm. No.

1220
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,291
Why not?

1221
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,458
'Cause I like it.

1222
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,833
I think it's really good.

1223
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,333
I mean, I'm assuming
B's Session Number Three, that's you?

1224
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh yeah. You know,
this is actually… it's a… it's a classic.

1225
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,458
Oh, this is a classic?

1226
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,375
Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone says so.

1227
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,041
- [Blaire] Oh, everyone says so?
- Mm-hmm.

1228
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
People, like who?

1229
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,125
You know, people like… my grandma?

1230
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,458
- Yeah. [laughs]
- [Benny laughs]

1231
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,500
So, when are you gonna play this
for other people?

1232
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:50,833
Well, I'm planning on it. I… I want
to do something… something with this.

1233
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,791
It's more than fun.
I wanna turn it into something real.

1234
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,458
And when I do, you know,

1235
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,875
then you could tell people
that you're my first fan.

1236
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,458
- So, in a way, you're welcome.
- Oh, I can?

1237
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,500
Yeah, you know, if you want.

1238
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,583
Well, I mean, for what it's worth,

1239
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,041
I believe you. It's really good.

1240
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,041
You're really talented.

1241
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,458
[inhales] And you're a very good driver.

1242
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,666
- [laughs] Thanks.
- [Blaire] Mmm.

1243
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
[chuckles]

1244
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,750
Well, what… what about you?

1245
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
What about me? [chuckles]

1246
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,791
You know, is there anything that you like?
Anything you're passionate about?

1247
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,500
I mean, like, in a past life.

1248
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,375
[inhales deeply]

1249
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,708
Zoé and I are always talking
about, like, the shit we're gonna do.

1250
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,250
- You know?
- When did you two meet?

1251
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,291
Um… [laughs]

1252
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,875
She had this place
in Laurel Canyon in the '70s,

1253
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,708
and she would throw these parties.

1254
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,125
So, they would go
for like three or four days.

1255
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,291
Everyone was there. And she loved Bowie,

1256
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,083
so she had this, like…
the Bowie haircut, you know.

1257
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,375
She was cool, man.
The queen bitch, that was her.

1258
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,166
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, that checks out.

1259
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,791
And I was, like, just like a stray
when I first moved here,

1260
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:06,500
and I didn't feel like I fit anywhere.

1261
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,916
And it was like she saw me.

1262
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,125
She told me everything could be beautiful.

1263
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,625
[chuckles softly]

1264
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,166
She said a bunch of stuff.

1265
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,333
And then she turned me,

1266
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,000
and she gave me this life.

1267
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,583
[inhales deeply]

1268
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,041
Honestly, you should take this
to a producer.

1269
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,125
- [Benny] Yeah.
- [Blaire] You could make real money.

1270
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,333
[Benny] I know, I know, it's just
I don't think it's where it has to be yet.

1271
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,166
Where does it have to be?
What's it missing?

1272
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,458
It's missing a little something
before it becomes like a...

1273
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,250
- Like, what? A classic?
- Yeah.

1274
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,750
- Mmm.
- Yeah, a classic.

1275
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,041
[Zoé clears throat] We need to leave.

1276
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,416
Yeah. Cool.

1277
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,625
Hi.

1278
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,583
We're done with Benny, right?
He can stay here.

1279
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,833
I don't think so.

1280
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,583
- Well, this has nothing to do with him.
- He's coming. That's how it's gotta be.

1281
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,500
Why are you being like this?

1282
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,875
Do you want to be the one to tell Victor?

1283
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey.

1284
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,416
I'm coming with you.

1285
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:29,708
Good.

1286
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
[Benny] Let's go.

1287
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,875
[Jay] Anything happens to me,

1288
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,250
you take care of Benny.

1289
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,958
You protect him.

1290
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,333
[man] Consider it done.

1291
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,416
[intense music playing]

1292
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:01,958
[Jay] Where's Benny?

1293
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,416
- [cutlery clinks]
- Jay. So glad you could make it.

1294
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,833
You put a hand on him or Maria,
I swear to God...

1295
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,833
Is that her name? We'll get to her.

1296
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,875
But first, sit.

1297
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,875
- Where are they?
- Sit.

1298
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,916
It's funny to think, though.

1299
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,958
Almost a hundred years ago,

1300
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,875
my kind sat across from your kind,

1301
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,916
much like you and I right now.

1302
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,458
And then they came up with that truce.

1303
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,291
[Jay] Well, you broke that truce.

1304
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,000
You took people from my neighborhood.

1305
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,750
Innocent people.

1306
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,541
Did you think we were gonna let
you get away with that?

1307
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:49,333
We? Who's this "we" you're talking about?

1308
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,333
Everyone's gone. I had them all killed.

1309
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:58,416
You should have taken my offer.
Now it's all going to be mine.

1310
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,166
You see, you're the last piece.

1311
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:07,458
Once you're gone,
this city's just one fat neck

1312
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,958
waiting to get sucked.

1313
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,875
You want me?

1314
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,250
Fine. Fair game.

1315
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,375
Maria and Benny
have nothing to do with this.

1316
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,458
Let them go.

1317
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,458
That's not how this is going to go.
Nobody walks.

1318
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,791
You know that.

1319
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:30,708
[grunts]

1320
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:33,375
[grunts, pants]

1321
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:37,000
- [grunts]
- How do I look? Do I look okay?

1322
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:39,125
[Jay panting]

1323
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,916
- Do you want some?
- [grunts]

1324
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,791
I saved her for you.

1325
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,708
Your sweet Maria.

1326
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,625
What?

1327
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,958
I saved her for you, Jay.

1328
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,916
- [laughs]
- No. No.

1329
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,583
Don't go soft on me now.

1330
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,375
We haven't even gotten started yet.

1331
01:14:58,458 --> 01:14:59,583
[Jay panting]

1332
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,208
[Zoé] Last kill.

1333
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,083
Let's do this.

1334
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:34,791
[dramatic music playing]

1335
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,958
Maybe lean close. This guy's a freak.

1336
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,125
Look what the night dragged in.

1337
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:53,583
Couple of strays.

1338
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,125
Good morning, Rocko.

1339
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
No such thing as a good morning.

1340
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,250
[Zoé] Mmm, maybe not for you.

1341
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't know you, do I?

1342
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,708
No, but I'm… I'm with them.

1343
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:12,000
[chuckles] That doesn't really change
your problem, amigo.

1344
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,875
- I don't know you.
- Don't worry about him. He's cool.

1345
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,291
Yeah, chill, he's with us.

1346
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,125
You cool?

1347
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
Cool, dude.

1348
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,416
Rough night?

1349
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,166
You look a little, uh, banged up, bro.

1350
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,166
Yeah, I'm… I'm a little banged up, bro.

1351
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:41,375
[tense music playing]

1352
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,416
[laughs]

1353
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,875
Oh, I'm just messing with you, man!
