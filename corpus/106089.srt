1
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,432
Why can't he use the doggy door?

2
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,062
He doesn't understand.
It's too new.

3
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,935
Your dog?

4
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,134
Your house.

5
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,927
-Did you see the paper?
-No.

6
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,621
The old man is stepping down.

7
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,165
-What?
-Junior's taking over. The king's dead.

8
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,633
-What a way to let us know.
-Tell me about it.

9
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,400
New York is putting him in charge of
both magazines. Consolidation.

10
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,443
Sales is tight. There could be some
layoffs in editorial, so watch your ass.

11
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:24,768
Hi, Mr. Gascon would like to see you.
Mr. Gascon Jr., that is.

12
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,439
Hey.

13
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,679
-We're getting fired, aren't we?
-l don't know.

14
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:42,685
Man. l just broke up with my girl
last Thursday. That was stupid.

15
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,084
Now I'm gonna have no job
and no girl.

16
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,486
I'll end up pushing mochas
at Starbucks.

17
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,822
How about you, Quincy?
You still going with that model?

18
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,759
-Helen.
-Don't break up.

19
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,834
No stress. Tonight, we're announcing
our engagement at the Zig Zag Club.

20
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,731
-You need to be there.
-After work?

21
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,202
-Yeah.
-After work could be in 1 0 minutes.

22
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,500
Mr. Gascon won't need
to see you. Thanks.

23
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,339
-See?
-Really? So l can go?

24
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,139
You can go. I'm sorry.

25
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,347
-Mr. Watson, he's ready for you.
-Just me?

26
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,797
-Excuse me.
-No, excuse me.

27
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,280
As you've probably heard, Quincy,
the company's downsizing.

28
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,344
Yeah, l heard that.

29
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,214
l have a problem, Quincy.
I've gotta let 1 5 percent of staff go.

30
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,288
It's unfortunate, and it's necessary.

31
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,524
Yeah.

32
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,091
Now, l see in your résumé...

33
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,288
...you went to graduate school
in psychology for a year.

34
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,830
Berkeley.

35
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,561
-You're familiar with crazy people.
-Mostly from living in L.A.

36
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,871
Okay. What do you know
about firing people?

37
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,974
-How's that?
-l don't know. Firing.

38
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,440
Just laying off, in general.

39
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,546
Employee termination, yeah.
There are several studies out.

40
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,648
l haven't studied it myself. Why?

41
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,512
Do you know the name
Jeffrey Jasper?

42
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,484
-Yeah, the guy from New Jersey.
-That's it. Got fired.

43
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,148
Got a gun. Got drunk.
Shot 1 0 executives in the stomach.

44
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,061
Well, l don't want to be Jaspered.
I'd like you to put together--

45
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,496
l don't know, a guideline
or a set of procedural outlines.

46
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,637
Wouldn't Mr. Peters from
human resources be more qualified?

47
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,204
He probably would.
l fired him this morning.

48
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,069
He didn't like it.
Said he'd kill me with a golf club.

49
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,304
-Mr. Peters?
-A MacGregor 3 iron. Very specific.

50
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,949
I'd like those guidelines on my desk
by Friday afternoon.

51
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,211
-Is that gonna be a problem?
-No, sir.

52
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,189
Helen?

53
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,827
Helen?

54
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,994
Never can be too careful.

55
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,193
Watch out.

56
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,338
Oh, my bad.

57
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,507
You all right?

58
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,769
"See you tonight, love..."
Love you too.

59
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,913
<i>"Termination of Employees:</i>

60
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,517
<i>Psychological Strategies</i>
<i>for Employers.</i>

61
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,311
Got somebody you wanna fire?''

62
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,488
Q, relax.
She's gonna be here, all right? Relax.

63
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,993
All right, hey. Let me get the toast.

64
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,066
-To my cousin Q.
-Yes.

65
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,297
To having sex with the same woman
for the rest of your life...

66
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,568
...over and over and over again.

67
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,804
In so many different positions.
Don't you sleep on that.

68
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,574
That's what you need to do too.
lf she don't hurry--

69
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,945
-Relax. She's gonna be here.
- I'm good.

70
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,678
-You good, but I'm....
-There she is, right there.

71
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,119
There he go. There he go.

72
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,220
Where you been, huh?
Everybody is waiting on you.

73
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,365
You got Evan, Greg, Lamont, Trey,
everybody here. Where your girls?

74
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,534
-They're not coming.
-Okay. Why not?

75
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,468
-l didn't invite them.
-You wanna break it to them later?

76
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,972
What? You wanna get a little kissy
or something back here in the back?

77
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,145
-I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
-You don't wanna get engaged now?

78
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,612
Please don't be mad. But l think we
should take some time off.

79
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,112
Away from each other.
Think things through.

80
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:40,186
-For what?
-Everything between us is too right.

81
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,693
-Too easy. Never dramatic.
-What are you talking about?

82
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:51,097
I'm 25 years old and still waiting
for that, you know, grand passion.

83
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,132
l mean, it's not your fault.
You just don't do grand.

84
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,538
You don't do sweeping,
romantic gestures.

85
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,373
Look, l wanna marry you. l wanna
spend the rest of my life with you.

86
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,915
Ain't that grand and sweeping?
At least sweeping?

87
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:11,514
See, you just don't get it. l need to be
away from you for a while.

88
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,182
-What did l do to you?
-l am so sorry.

89
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,023
You gonna make these people
think l hit you. Where you going?

90
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,359
-It's not important.
-It's important to me.

91
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,434
-You don't wanna know.
-Girl, l wanna know.

92
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,003
-No, you don't.
-Girl, you better tell me where.

93
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,639
What, you crying?

94
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:33,005
I'm going to Paris with Tony...

95
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,305
-You going to Paris with who?
-...tomorrow.

96
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,317
You're going to Paris
with my best man?

97
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,283
And l gathered these people
to announce my engagement?

98
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,718
l was gonna send a letter,
but it's not fair.

99
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,586
Are you high? Are you smoking?
Write me a letter?

100
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:52,093
-Oh, write me a postcard from Paris?
-No. it wouldn't have been a postcard.

101
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,233
You know that l love you.

102
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,733
Girl, l don't even know who you are.
You somebody else right now.

103
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:03,034
You a alien right now.
Helen, Helen. Girl, don't--

104
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:07,474
-l think she just kicked him to the curb.
-Lord, have mercy.

105
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,298
Quincy.

106
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,829
-Quincy. What are you doing?
-Hey, Mr. Gascon. Hey.

107
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,701
You got a handle on it?

108
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,409
-A handle on what?
-On the firing.

109
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,910
Yeah. I've researched.
Got everything together.

110
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,708
-Okay. All right. Excellent.
-Yeah, yeah.

111
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,818
-All right, here you go.
-Okay. All right. l see names.

112
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,046
-What is--? What is this?
-Yeah. Well...

113
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,316
...it's just a little
hands-on experience.

114
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,086
Right. l don't understand
what you're talking about.

115
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:59,321
Come on. What?
Don't go daft on me here.

116
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,127
-I'm not. Yeah.
-It's a list of people who need to be...

117
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,497
-...fired.
-What? You want me to do it?

118
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,173
-Of course. You're the expert.
-No, wait a minute.

119
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,140
l was just doing the research. l didn't
know you were about to fire people.

120
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,041
Yeah. No, no.
Well, see, l thought l was clear.

121
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,114
-No, no.
-Well, then that's my error. All right.

122
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,784
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Okay. Okay.

123
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,648
-Well, let me know how it goes.
-Mr. Gascon, listen.

124
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,983
-l am not comfortable with this.
-Well, of course not.

125
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,717
To feel comfortable,
you'd have to be a monster.

126
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,193
-Yeah, yeah.
-No, you're no monster. Neither am l.

127
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,834
-Right, right.
-l just happen to be in the position...

128
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,367
...to delegate, and you are not.

129
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,003
Hey, good luck.

130
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,044
-Quincy. What's happening, man?
-Hey, nothing.

131
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,841
-You look awful.
-Thanks.

132
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,986
-Looks like it was quite a blowout.
-Yeah, l was blown out.

133
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,213
-All right. So, what's up?
-This and that.

134
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,854
-This and that?
-Yeah.

135
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,994
-Sandra said you wanted to see me.
-Yeah.

136
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,728
-So it's like that, huh?
-Look....

137
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,036
That's cool.

138
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,469
Shit!

139
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,687
-Make sure Mr. Gascon gets this.
-Sure.

140
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,451
Q.

141
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,955
Q. Come on, open up the door, man.

142
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,294
Oh, Q. Man, what you wearing, Q?

143
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,564
-You know, it feels good on my skin.
-You gonna let me in?

144
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,602
-What you want?
-That's for what.

145
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,899
Your mother,
my auntie's been calling me...

146
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,839
...every day early for a week.
She's worried about you.

147
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,637
-You can't call her?
-Been busy.

148
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,371
-You been busy?
-I've been busy.

149
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,015
-Move out--
-Watch the piss.

150
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,675
-What's that?
-You so in a hurry, you ain't looking.

151
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,715
Oh, no. No, no, no.

152
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,619
-See, this is disturbing, Q.
-Kind of a mess, huh?

153
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,023
It's like an outer extension of disease.
Where's your stuff?

154
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,596
Helen, you know, she took some stuff.
Took a TV.

155
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,291
Left me with the dog and a
half-naked picture of herself. Just evil.

156
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,995
-l gave her everything but my soul.
-And l bet they want that too.

157
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,140
-Just greedy.
-Don't give it to them.

158
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,640
All you gotta do is pretend
to give it to them.

159
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,836
Why do l have to pretend?
Why can't l just be me?

160
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,447
Nobody finds pathetic charming.

161
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,018
Was that cheese? Okay, look,
I'm sorry about Helen, okay?

162
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,088
But you got to pull yourself
together, bro.

163
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,986
-l been writing.
-You been writing?

164
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,889
Letters to Helen. A few letters.

165
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,825
How many letters, Q?

166
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,592
-l could not get the right tone.
-No, how many letters?

167
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,203
l just kept obsessing over the way
she left me and what she told me.

168
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,397
Then it came to me, with my
employee-termination research...

169
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,408
...that if Helen was my boss,
then the way she fired me was bad...

170
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:38,311
...bad in every way. Public humiliation,
conflicting messages, horrific timing.

171
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,451
Oh, yeah, l wrote a letter.

172
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:45,818
l wrote a letter detailing the disgust
l have at her method and technique.

173
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,721
Her method and her technique
for dumping you?

174
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,988
-Exactly.
-Oh, okay, man. Where is this letter?

175
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,297
-I'm calling your mom.
-Wait.

176
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,230
No, that is a scream for help.
I'm calling your mother.

177
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,463
it started out as a letter,
then it evolved into a manual.

178
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,767
A manual on how to break up
with a lover...

179
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,968
...based on psychological and
employee-termination research.

180
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,807
You're telling me you don't find
any of this strange?

181
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,644
What's strange, huh?
What's strange about it?

182
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,152
When you break up with somebody,
and firing somebody's the same...

183
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,588
...you wanna do it the easiest way
without producing a stalker.

184
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,459
- l call it <i>The Plan.</i>
- <i>The Plan</i>?

185
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,259
<i>The Plan</i>. it is brilliant.

186
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,901
You got a table of contents?

187
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,337
l don't believe him.

188
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,203
''Committed or committable?
Time to kill.

189
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,706
Location, location.''
Why break up at her place?

190
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,971
You control the duration of the
breakup, leave when you want.

191
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,412
A person can follow you if you're
at a bar, restaurant or hotel.

192
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,984
But ain't nobody leaving
their own apartment.

193
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,689
-And the answering machine?
-Change the outgoing message...

194
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,089
...to the mechanical one because a
breakup-ee will call the breakup-er...

195
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,559
...just to hear their voice
and then hang up.

196
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:02,894
And what that does, it creates a cycle
of emotional desperation...

197
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,731
...especially if the message says,
''I'm not here. I'm in Paris....''

198
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:13,035
You see, to me, falling in love
is blissful insanity.

199
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,304
But breaking up,
that's a rational act.

200
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:21,180
Now, how do we improve upon that
rational act? We do it through science.

201
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,152
What were you planning on
doing with this?

202
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,290
I'm....

203
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,657
l got a betty l been seeing
for three months.

204
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,827
Chapter 6. Yeah.
What's--? Capricorn?

205
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,967
-Aries.
-Oh, yeah.

206
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,534
You wanna take this
on a field test.

207
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,697
Quincy? We're gonna be rich, bro.
We are gonna be so incredibly rich.

208
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,659
<i>How to dress. How to act.</i>
<i>What to wear. What not to wear.</i>

209
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:50,069
<i>All I've done is just research
<i>and realize that you can break up...</i>

210
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,743
<i>...but improve on it by the science.</i>

211
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,176
-That's my boyfriend's cousin there.
-Who's that, honey?

212
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,681
The guy on TV, talking about
the book he wrote on how to break up.

213
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:04,584
Not exactly leading us out of the Dark
Ages, is he? He's kind of cute, though.

214
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,350
-What's he like?
-l don't know. l never met him.

215
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,687
-But l know he is one lonely puppy.
-Why do you say that?

216
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:14,798
What woman would go out with a guy
whose expertise is dumping people?

217
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,732
You got a point. Okay, here we go.

218
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,905
<i>What's your love life like?</i>

219
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,535
<i>- Are you seeing anyone?</i>
<i>- Give me a second.</i>

220
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,981
So, what do you want me to do?

221
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,012
Something drastic. I've been
seeing Evan for three months...

222
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,052
...and l really like him,
but he's getting a bit twitchy.

223
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,917
You know how the fine ones are.

224
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,523
l think l need to shock him.

225
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,718
l need to shock myself.
l had that dream again.

226
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,491
-The one with the straps?
-No. The one with Halle Berry.

227
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,793
-So....
-Dreaming of Halle before a haircut...

228
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,996
...is as clear a sign you're
gonna get in this lifetime.

229
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:06,149
How does it feel to be in the building
as an author and not a slave?

230
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,479
-l can wait by Philip's office.
-l don't want you to be lonely.

231
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,485
-Lonely?
-You gotta get out more...

232
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,521
...because it's depressing
seeing you.

233
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,360
A fan wrote me a letter,
said l was arrogant.

234
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,395
No, no. Let me tell you something.
You have supplied...

235
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,362
-...a humanitarian service to the world.
-No.

236
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,059
No, listen to me.
You should feel good about that.

237
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,738
How is anybody gonna find
their one true love...

238
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,774
...when they're stuck in a bunch of
dead-end relationships? Quincy...

239
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,977
-...you are a love enabler.
-l just need somebody normal.

240
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,276
Oh, see, there you go. There are no
normal relationships. You know why?

241
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,112
Because there are no
normal women.

242
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,380
You know what? A girl came to
my crib. Never seen her before.

243
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,219
-Says that she dug the book.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. A groupie.

244
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,420
Oh, my boy had his first groupie.
Groupies are there to please, okay.

245
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,032
They're there to do whatever,
whenever, however you want, kid.

246
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,227
-l couldn't close the deal.
-Oh, Q! Don't tell me that, man.

247
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,736
Do you know what I'd do
to get with a groupie?

248
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,340
lf it happens again,
you can pretend you're me.

249
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:08,610
I'm gonna do that. l gotta meet up with
Nicky later. You wanna check her out?

250
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,012
-Nope. How many weeks she got left?
-Technically, her time's almost up.

251
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,654
-But she's a little freaky. So....
-You like her.

252
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,188
-No.
-You gazed into just midair.

253
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,485
-No, l....
-When you like people, you gaze.

254
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:28,360
All right, you know what it is? She has
this long, black, thick, sexy, sexy hair.

255
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,565
-Just got the weirdest pain in my nuts.
-l don't want to be staring at that.

256
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,740
Anyway, you'd like her, Q. She does
physical therapy at the hospital.

257
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,574
-You know, she's bright.
-Mulatto?

258
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,410
-No, no. A little cinnamon.
-Okay. Bright like smart.

259
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,449
Yeah, bright like smart. She's tough.

260
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,384
She has body and that long,
long, black hair.

261
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,718
Oh, shit, there it is again.

262
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,520
Boy, you are too old
to be having the crabs.

263
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,864
You been putting that where
you ain't supposed to?

264
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,158
It's a very social organ, but....

265
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,133
-Yo.
<i>- He's ready for you.</i>

266
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,635
Okay. All I'm saying is that
one day a girl's gonna dump you...

267
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,605
...before you dump her. It's gonna
have you very Eric Benét: sensitive.

268
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,744
-Don't jinx me.
-I'm not jinxing you.

269
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,675
She's gonna hide things from you.

270
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,044
The next thing you know, she's gonna
give you those fatal words:

271
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,811
''Baby, l think we need to talk.''

272
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,949
-Respond to the door.
-Okay, fine. I'm out.

273
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,058
-Twist it, respond, out.
-Need something from the clinic?

274
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,021
-Hey.
-Hey.

275
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,429
-Author, author. Good to see you.
-King Author, baby. King Author.

276
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,296
-What's cracking?
-Well, yeah.

277
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,165
-Ready to do the second printing?
-Let's get cracking.

278
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,103
-Publishing boys treating you right?
-Pretty decent.

279
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,277
That book is just
the beginning too.

280
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,413
I'm seeing the whole line now
of <i>Spoil</i> books.

281
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,413
<i>Spoil's Guide to Sex.</i>
<i>Spoil's Guide to Golf.</i>

282
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,678
<i>- Spoil's Guide to Pimping.</i>
-I'm branding the whole damn world.

283
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,185
-Yeah.
-Okay.

284
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,688
Guess you're wondering why
l asked you up here.

285
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,589
-Yeah, why am l here?
-Okay, just-- Why don't you sit.

286
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,960
Let me just put it right out on the table.
l need your help.

287
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,167
-With what?
-Firing somebody.

288
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:18,699
Which is not the right word. More
''letting go,'' ''getting rid of,'' ''losing.''

289
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,845
-Another employee?
-It's my girlfriend.

290
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,981
You want me to help you
fire your girl?

291
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:28,243
Well, no, if only you could.
No, no. I've gotta do this myself.

292
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,184
I'm not gonna delegate this.
l would if l could, but l can't. It's just...

293
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,724
...l am at my wit's end. This woman--
God, she has a power over me.

294
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,328
Just a-- It's like a voodoo, hoodoo,
she do! She's got me.

295
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,294
l am-- I'm not in control.

296
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,759
No. This is not me.

297
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,264
Hi, it's Sandra.

298
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,201
You asked me to tell you
if there was anything to know.

299
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,536
<i>- Mr. Gascon has brought in a ringer.</i>
-l need a professional.

300
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,974
-Breakup professional?
-Breakup professional.

301
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,545
-Me?
-You.

302
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,477
-Him.
-You've got to help me.

303
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,450
No, it's a disaster. My God.
Amy, l look like a bigheaded alien.

304
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:07,353
No, Evan's gonna freak.
No, l don't know what l did. It's ugly.

305
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,290
Oh, Jesus. Would you stop
with the ''perfect couple'' crap?

306
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,159
No, no, l don't look like Halle Berry.
l look like her Yorkshire terrier.

307
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,533
Okay. No, l gotta go.

308
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,935
Nicky.

309
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,136
-Nicky.
-I'm in the bedroom.

310
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,506
All right, come on.
We're gonna be late.

311
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,776
-Did you hear me?
-I'm not coming out.

312
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,249
-What?
-Never. I'm never coming out.

313
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,355
-What are you doing up there?
-Nothing.

314
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,354
You're doing nothing in
the bedroom?

315
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,084
-Yeah.
-And why are you never coming out?

316
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,560
-Because I'm hiding.
-And why are you hiding?

317
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,861
Baby, we need to talk.

318
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,136
Damn, he did jinx me.

319
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,499
Prepare yourself.

320
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,669
God.

321
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,608
Evan?

322
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,219
Hey, Evan?

323
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,889
Evan?

324
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,703
-What's up, Q?
-What you doing here?

325
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,311
l was driving by and saw
you had the lights on.

326
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,812
-That's why I'm here.
-What's with the hitting?

327
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,042
-You jinxed me, man. l knew it.
-I'm gonna whup your ass.

328
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,244
-You know what happened?
-What?

329
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,548
-She tried to break up with me.
-What?

330
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,248
''What?'' She was being evasive
and she was hiding...

331
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,896
...and you know what she said to me?
''Baby, we need to talk.''

332
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,964
-Yeah, that sounds familiar, don't it?
-What did you say?

333
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,635
What do you mean?
l preempted the strike. l ran.

334
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,497
You was gonna break up anyway.

335
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,764
l was gonna break up with her.
You feeling that? l with her.

336
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,501
There's a world of difference.
But it's cool because l have a plan.

337
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,374
This the plan, okay? l made plans
to meet her at the Zig Zag at 9:00.

338
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,914
-Oh, come on.
-So you're gonna show up there.

339
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,710
<i>You tell her I'm gonna be late.</i>

340
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,821
<i>You're gonna talk me up.</i>
<i>Tell her what a great guy I am...</i>

341
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,584
<i>...how cool it is for her to be with me.</i>
<i>Call me. I take it from there.</i>

342
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,886
-Where you gonna be?
-I'll be right here.

343
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:28,191
-Why you staying at my place?
-l can't go home. She'll find me there.

344
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,027
-Chapter 3.
-Chapter 3.

345
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,566
-You been reading.
-Come on.

346
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,567
That's why you're nervous.

347
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,612
Nicky?

348
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,786
-Maybe.
-Maybe not, huh? What is your name?

349
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:00,021
-No, I'm not Nicky. Sorry.
-Okay, that's the wrong name.

350
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,910
Excuse me. Quincy.
Did you ask me my name?

351
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,879
-No.
-You didn't just...?

352
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,609
-Okay, well, my name is Quincy.
-Okay.

353
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,219
-Mary.
-Mary, nice to meet you.

354
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,860
l was actually here because my cousin
sent me to find his girlfriend.

355
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,155
She has long hair.
l never realized how many women...

356
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,060
...in L.A. had long hair.

357
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,727
No other distinguishing characteristics
like a scar or a tattoo...

358
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,429
-...dimples or something?
-Pretty smile.

359
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,706
No, not to my knowledge.

360
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,206
Maybe her description of you is
more detailed than yours of her.

361
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,607
She doesn't know me.

362
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,339
She thinks she's coming
to meet her boyfriend.

363
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,281
-But she's not?
-No, no. My cousin sent me because...

364
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,888
...for some reason, he is terrified
she's gonna break up with him.

365
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,557
Why would he think that?

366
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,522
Because she wants to talk.

367
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,423
He ever think she'd wanna
talk about something else?

368
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,655
You know women
when they just want to talk.

369
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,302
You guys, when y'all wanna talk,
y'all talk. And y'all talking.

370
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,562
-Just talky-talk.
-We're funny like that.

371
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,069
Really.

372
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,674
-What'd he expect you to do about it?
-He wants me to chat her up...

373
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,902
...tell her how great of a guy he is.

374
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,910
-That's really high-school.
-l said the same thing.

375
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,743
And the cold part is l gotta lie.

376
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,681
-He ain't great.
-What do you mean?

377
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,549
He's a misogynist.
He's a player, you know?

378
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,384
And he has a three-month
commitment clause.

379
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,085
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah. No, a firm policy.

380
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,356
-Sounds like a real peach.
-Even within the three months...

381
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,024
...he messes with other girls anyway.
So I'm like, ''What's the deal?''

382
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,534
-Yeah, what is the deal?
-Enough. Want a drink?

383
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,264
Yeah, a bloody mary.
Can l get a double, please?

384
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,535
Mary likes bloody marys. That's cute.

385
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:58,808
Yeah. So, Quincy,
what is it that you do?

386
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:03,348
-l am an editor for <i>Spoil</i> magazine.
-Really?

387
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:09,658
Wow. You know,
you remind me of someone.

388
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,662
-You remind me of somebody too.
-Really?

389
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,855
Halle Berry.

390
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,662
You got that.

391
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,133
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

392
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,506
-Q.
-No-show.

393
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,647
-Damn. That's a sign, isn't it?
-Like a flashing red light before a cliff.

394
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,873
Wanna go get something
to drink, man?

395
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,211
l can't, man. l just met this babe.

396
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,854
We might go get some dinner
and a club later.

397
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,583
l didn't mention that l wrote the book.
Is that dishonest?

398
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,761
You're on a date.
It's all dishonest.

399
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,292
All right.

400
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,627
Strange. You were gonna meet
your date, l was gonna meet mine.

401
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,328
And we meet each other
at the same time. Strange.

402
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,871
-That's not strange.
-No?

403
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,067
-No. You wanna hear strange?
-Give me strange.

404
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,644
-Teratomas.
-That's them little cookies?

405
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,906
-They come in a package?
-That's tiramisu.

406
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,244
Teratomas. They're tumors
that can grow inside our bodies...

407
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,422
...formed by all three
embryonic precursors.

408
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,525
-What does that mean?
-it means that they have hair...

409
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,595
...and skin and glands, so they sweat
like you are now, and brain tissue.

410
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,630
l saw one pulled out of a woman
the size of a basketball.

411
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,099
And when they cut it open,
she had a full row of teeth.

412
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,432
All the stuff that comes together
to form human life are there.

413
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,007
But somehow they dissemble into
something hideous. It's crazy.

414
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,612
So, what's the strangest thing
that you know?

415
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,177
Can't bite through your own skin.

416
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,748
-What?
-It's impossible.

417
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:18,048
First law of nature: self-preservation.
You can't do it, because you're selfish.

418
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,225
l can't bite through my own flesh,
because I'm too selfish?

419
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,654
-Try to.
-No.

420
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,488
-Bite into yourself.
-That's lame.

421
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,961
-Bite yourself.
-All right.

422
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,405
You want some hot sauce?

423
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,635
l can't bite into my skin,
because I'm sane.

424
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,711
It's the same thing, biologically
speaking. See, if you're not selfish...

425
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,280
...that means you're crazy
and you could do it.

426
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:49,044
What about if you care about someone
more than you care about yourself?

427
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,780
First, why would you do that?
Second, are you talking about love?

428
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,688
Yeah. Love.

429
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:00,590
lf someone is in love, therefore
not selfish, then he or she is crazy...

430
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:05,298
...and could bite through
his or her own flesh.

431
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,671
So being in love and being crazy
are one and the same?

432
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,204
It's obvious.

433
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,899
-Wanna bite your other hand?
-No.

434
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:18,206
Wanna bite me? I'm tender.
I'm moist. I'm loving.

435
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,622
Hello.

436
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,133
Quincy Watson, l presume?

437
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,413
Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Quincy.

438
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,552
Quincy Watson.
What's up? Come on.

439
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,916
-I'm Rita Monroe.
-Oh, yes, you are, Rita.

440
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,232
-That's his way of saying hello.
-Oh, God.

441
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,368
''Hello, Rita.''

442
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,733
-Drink?
-You do know why I'm here?

443
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:23,371
l do know. l do. Do--?
Do l--? Do l know why?

444
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,042
One second.

445
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,716
-So you read my book?
-I'm familiar with it.

446
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,523
I'm also familiar with the fact
that you plan...

447
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,218
...on giving my Philip
breakup pointers.

448
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,195
Not a very good idea.
I'm completely....

449
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:49,032
Everyone has a job, and mine is
to become Mrs. Philip Gascon.

450
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,238
I'm sorry. You were saying?

451
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:55,469
I'm saying that l think we need to
work some things out.

452
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,406
One professional to another.

453
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,946
-Professional?
-Don't be under any illusions.

454
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,619
It's not all love.

455
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,654
It's not love.
l think l understand now.

456
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:10,123
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
l wasn't expecting you to be so--

457
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,319
-What? So honest?
-Straightforward.

458
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,465
There's no need for us to work
against each other on this.

459
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,698
-You wanna talk compensation?
-Wow. Very direct.

460
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,838
-Was l too fast for you?
-No. I'm just used to placating...

461
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,940
...scared little rabbits, you know?

462
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,600
I'm not used to doing business
with a real man.

463
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,784
l need to find an ATM.

464
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,700
Oh, what the hell?

465
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,635
-Look at the town drunk.
-Where am l?

466
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,372
You're in my living room. What kind
of man corrupts another man's dog?

467
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,880
-You see a woman around?
-You that freaky...

468
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,881
...you need help
to get a dog drunk?

469
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,554
What you do to the dog?
I'm gonna report you.

470
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,553
It's not your dog,
it's your ex's.

471
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,159
lf Helen came home now and saw
an alcoholic pug, what would she say?

472
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,829
You can't let pugs drink,
they're not rottweilers.

473
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,932
-They got little-bitty kidneys.
-Helen's not coming back.

474
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,962
it ain't about Helen.

475
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,603
No. And it's definitely not
about the dog.

476
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,104
l don't know what kind of freaky stuff--
You got my drawers on?

477
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,146
Mr. Lynch, I've told you...

478
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,447
...don't take your clothes off
for therapy.

479
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,248
Hold my dick.

480
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,949
Okay. I'll come back
when you get dressed.

481
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,655
<i>Dr. Jacobs, call 2035.</i>

482
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,266
Evan called.
One o'clock, your place.

483
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:36,340
A little afternoon delight?
Oh, he's so romantic.

484
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,236
You guys are the reason l date.

485
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,809
He thinks I'm breaking up with him.
He's freaking out.

486
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,880
-Are you?
-No, or l wasn't.

487
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,813
Then l went on a date with Quincy,
who thinks I'm Mary.

488
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,385
And found out that if true,
Evan is Satan.

489
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,056
Not that Quincy's reliable,
given he lied about...

490
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,487
...what he does or did
in writing that book.

491
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,652
But he did seem sincere, and there's
the craziest freaking attraction that's--

492
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,764
Oh, God.

493
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,524
So l guess the answer's yes.

494
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,702
-Yes, what?
-I'm dumping Evan's ass for lunch.

495
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,870
-Hey.
-You're late.

496
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,737
-What are we doing way out here?
-Spies.

497
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,540
l don't think you fully realize the
seriousness of the situation I'm in.

498
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:22,208
l got techniques for you so good you
will never worry about this girl again.

499
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,647
Now, what's the plan?

500
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,057
Early supper, maybe a DVD
back at my place.

501
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,850
Can we get the DVD at her place?

502
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,961
-Her place. Now, what do l say?
-Nothing.

503
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,653
-Nothing?
-It's what you do.

504
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,389
-Well, what do l do?
-You sulk.

505
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,662
Pardon?

506
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,272
And then eventually,
she will ask you....

507
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,738
-What's wrong?
-Then you will respond by saying...

508
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,375
...nothing. Come on, come on.

509
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:59,086
-Honey, something must be wrong.
-No, nothing.

510
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,057
-Something is obviously wrong.
-No, it's nothing.

511
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,425
Tell me.
Please tell me what's bothering you.

512
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,897
Now you got her. She's desperate.
Hit her right between the eyes.

513
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,161
Well, if you must know,
l wanna break up.

514
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,267
Wait a second. Just like that?

515
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,034
l call it the passive-aggressive
bullet to the head.

516
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,710
She feels responsible.

517
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,540
Then eventually, she'll squeak out,
''But why?''

518
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:28,515
And then you just look right in her
eyes and say, ''Hey, l don't love you.''

519
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,046
And then you bounce.

520
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,186
Wow. Well, it sounds a bit cruel.

521
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:39,523
It's less cruel than a bad relationship.
Now, I'm gonna give you these.

522
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,063
Okay? That reminds you who you are.

523
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,259
You're hard metal. You're steel.

524
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,569
l still don't know why we
couldn't go to your place.

525
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,711
l like the smell of new paint.

526
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,347
-Drink?
-No, thank you.

527
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,497
You look like you
swallowed a spider.

528
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,230
l didn't just swallow a spider.

529
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,669
-A rat?
-No.

530
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,238
-Wanna know what it is?
-What you swallowed?

531
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:32,610
-Why l am sulking?
-it just looks like you're constipated.

532
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,149
No. l explained to you
that l was sulking.

533
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,843
Because you're constipated.

534
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,522
-When was the last movement?
-It's not about that.

535
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,715
-You want to know what it's about?
-No.

536
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,019
-Well, why not?
-Because you look so cute.

537
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,359
There's something on my mind.
Something you should know.

538
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,762
Philip, rub my leg. l have a cramp.

539
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,295
Don't you wanna know
what's on my mind?

540
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,336
Rub my leg first.

541
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,599
Higher.

542
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,277
Higher.

543
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,514
What's on your mind, big boy?

544
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,303
Let's go.

545
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,039
It's open.

546
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,088
-You cut your hair.
-l know.

547
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,757
No, but l mean, like,
you really cut your hair.

548
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,017
l mean, you look like that actress.

549
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,718
-Halle Berry.
-No, not Halle Berry, please. No.

550
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,565
The actress in that movie
about the crack addicts.

551
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,064
-That's who you look like.
-Like a crackhead?

552
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,464
it doesn't matter,
because, you know...

553
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,435
-...that's one hell of a cut.
-So, what, you like it?

554
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,371
No, l hate it. That's good.
it makes it so much easier.

555
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,067
-l wanna break up.
-What?

556
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,372
Yeah. ''What?'' l wanna break up.

557
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:14,108
You can't break up with me. I'm
supposed to break up with your ass.

558
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,512
Well....

559
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,022
Apparently not.

560
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,455
This is so unfair. This is so completely
like you, just totally contrary.

561
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:29,064
Okay, but why you yelling? Because
you wanted to break up with me.

562
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,734
Yesterday you wanted to have
''the talk.'' Remember?

563
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,166
l didn't want to break up.
You thought l did.

564
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,306
Oh, no. No, no.
Okay. l saw the sulk.

565
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,271
-You were sulking when l came in.
-That wasn't a sulk.

566
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,139
it was too a sulk.
Your forehead looked like a walnut.

567
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,906
-l saw it.
-Okay, today, l was sulking.

568
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,846
-Yesterday, total misread.
-Today, today. What?

569
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,350
-About the talking.
-So why'd you cut the hair?

570
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,648
-To keep you, dumb-ass.
-This is too confusing. I'm out.

571
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,258
Be gone, nigga. l don't care.
Who's keeping you?

572
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,951
You're real indignant,
considering you stood me up.

573
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,687
l did not.
You stood me up.

574
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,059
It's good. I'm leaving.
But you stood me up.

575
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,430
You practically forced me to go out
on a date with another guy.

576
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,002
What?

577
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,969
Yeah.

578
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,244
-What other guy?
-Whoever l was out with, obviously.

579
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,140
-Where'd you go?
-Where we were at.

580
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,144
Now you fronting.
You a comedian now?

581
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,283
It's good, because I'm up out of here.

582
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,611
How long you been seeing this guy?

583
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:27,014
You know what? That's no longer
any of your business, now, is it?

584
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,591
-Did you do it?
-No, not really.

585
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,704
-You're still together?
-No, he dumped me.

586
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,473
He dumped you? Wow.

587
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,142
-He's good.
-Too good.

588
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,437
it doesn't make sense.
You were perfect.

589
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,048
-You should get married.
-it makes perfect sense.

590
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,276
His best friend shows up,
acts like he doesn't know who l am.

591
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,514
Talks smack about Evan to get me
all angry, knows all these great lines...

592
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,521
...and then lies about what he does.

593
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,389
''And what does he do?'' you ask. He
masterminds breakups. It's obvious.

594
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,225
-it is?
-They did the old bait and switch.

595
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,196
Evan handed me off
to Quincy, like:

596
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,302
''I'd slap that ass.
You give it a try.''

597
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,369
No. What are you gonna do about it?

598
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,631
Quincy doesn't know that l know.

599
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,402
He doesn't see that l see
the connection with Evan.

600
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,011
That l know about
that stupid book he wrote.

601
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,047
That's fine and dandy.
I'll keep our little date tonight.

602
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,077
Take him down the old romance path.

603
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,780
When he leans in to kiss me, that
first awkward kiss of the evening...

604
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,323
-Yeah.
-...l pull back and laugh.

605
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,155
I'll dump his ass so hard
he'll be using a walker.

606
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,795
What?

607
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,661
-it sounds a little childish.
-it is not.

608
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,202
Okay. Maybe Evan will realize
how much he's in love with you...

609
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,738
...and then you can suggest
couple's counseling or....

610
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,870
It's time for my rounds.
We'll talk later.

611
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,242
Lay back, Mr. Lynch.

612
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,351
Q.

613
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,917
-What you doing here?
-Just helping Philip.

614
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,219
Forget about Philip.
Your boy got problems.

615
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,521
-l know that.
-You ready for this?

616
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,631
-I'm in love.
-That's what you said.

617
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,267
No, no. That was lust.
That was just bump and grinding...

618
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,405
...talking-dirty-while-
I'm-spanking-that-ass lust. This--

619
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,767
-This is love. It's Nicky.
-Right.

620
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,944
-l broke up with her today.
-Strange way to show your love.

621
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,046
l wasn't in love with her
when l did it, okay? At least...

622
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,840
...l didn't think l was.

623
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,881
Was l in love with her when l did it?

624
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:39,488
No. it wasn't until she told me she was
seeing another guy. That's what it is.

625
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,920
-That's jealousy. That ain't love.
-Think so?

626
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,651
Of course it's jealousy,
that's what I'm saying.

627
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,092
Why would l be jealous
if l wasn't in love?

628
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,961
-Because we trip like that sometimes.
-l think l made a big mistake.

629
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,762
l don't know what to do.
What you think l should do?

630
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,405
Buy her something.
Diamond rings, clothes.

631
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,734
-Here we go. You're no help.
-Credit card.

632
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,002
l need to find the dude,
stick my foot up his ass.

633
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,111
He might be big.
Might whup your ass.

634
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,715
You know, if it wasn't for
that stupid haircut that she had....

635
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,920
-She cut her hair?
-Cut her hair. Can you believe--?

636
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,555
Women know that's an
aggressive act towards men.

637
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,521
Women cut their hair, it's aggression.
She aggressed me.

638
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,251
-No long hair?
-No long hair.

639
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,657
Thinks she look like Halle Berry.
Come on.

640
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,559
Halle Be--

641
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,793
You know, it's--

642
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,995
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing. l was bubbling.

643
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,506
You know, my stomach is bad.
l ate some of those taquitos...

644
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,737
...that they had out in the front.
No, l need to go.

645
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,381
Where's a--?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

646
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,113
Nicky?

647
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,461
So, Mary.

648
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,301
-Is that short for Marilyn?
-No.

649
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,669
Actually, it's not.

650
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,814
So why don't you tell me more
about your job as an editor.

651
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:02,176
Actually, you know what I'm
trying to do? I'm trying to write a book.

652
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,581
-Like a children's book.
-Of course, a book.

653
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,085
It's called <i>All Dogs Leave L.A.</i>

654
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:13,059
Because they can't get
any attention or any love.

655
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,055
-Where do they go?
-Compton.

656
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,561
Whatever happened to your sleazy
friend and his longhaired girlfriend?

657
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,365
-They broke up.
-How's he taking that?

658
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,340
-Feels like he made a big mistake.
-Does he?

659
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:45,725
Yeah, they say that honesty
is the most important element in love.

660
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,487
Oh, l don't believe that.

661
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:51,896
l think it's the most important element
in a relationship, but love...

662
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,903
...doesn't care about it
one way or the other.

663
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:00,634
What does it care about?

664
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,569
itself.

665
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,695
<i>Who the hell do you</i>
<i>think you are?</i>

666
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,371
We had a deal.

667
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,735
l don't know what crazy game
you think you're playing...

668
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,070
<i>- ...but you're out of your league.</i>
-Gotta be a wrong number.

669
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,406
-Safe word: rabbit.
-Grow up.

670
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:42,278
Listen, Mr. Watson, if you want more
than sex, then damn it, just speak up.

671
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:46,320
But double-dealing? Totally
unacceptable. You call me back.

672
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,855
These things are pinching me.

673
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:52,222
l swear, l don't know who it is.
They gotta have a wrong number.

674
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,056
-l don't know who it is.
-I'm out.

675
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,494
Some other Quincy.
Yo, wait, baby.

676
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,567
-Look, l swear l don't know who--
-Oh, you swear what?

677
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,898
That you're honest and forthright?
Is that what you swear?

678
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,006
Mostly, yeah.

679
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,983
Get all you need, bro.
Get all you need.

680
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:28,623
She took the day off. But
if there's anything l could do for you....

681
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,096
-Will she be here tomorrow?
-l don't think so.

682
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,235
l been calling.
She hasn't called back.

683
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,396
-You have the nicest eyes.
-Thanks.

684
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,838
Is there something else l can
help you with? l like your hat.

685
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,277
I'm so confused.

686
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:54,416
-Me too.
-What should l do, Mr. Lynch?

687
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,319
Love me.

688
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,619
And hold your dick, right?

689
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,690
Okay.

690
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,094
-Is he gone?
-Yep.

691
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,565
-Finally.
-l think he's really, really sorry.

692
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,328
Shouldn't you give him a chance?

693
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,769
-l don't know.
-You two belong together.

694
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,173
How about it?

695
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,149
lf you hate this girl so much,
why can't you break up with her?

696
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,318
It's called fear.
Don't get me wrong...

697
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:58,886
...she has many fine qualities:
beautiful, fun, smart....

698
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:02,616
But after a point, you get this feeling
of bottomless ruthlessness.

699
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:07,092
So tell me, you wicked little animal...

700
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,889
...what is Philip offering?

701
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,293
You tell me.

702
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,764
Nothing. Stinko. Zip.

703
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,028
Book payback.

704
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,604
-Book?
-Tit for tat. l can give you tit and tit.

705
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,368
-Philip Gascon?
-But you decide.

706
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:25,173
You helping Philip break up with me,
or are you helping me marry him?

707
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,248
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
-What is it?

708
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,921
l got a cramp.

709
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,454
-Where?
-It's in my leg.

710
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,656
Well, I'll help you rub it.

711
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,659
-Here?
-Yeah, right there.

712
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,265
That's where the cramp is.

713
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,026
<i>You're not even listening to me.</i>

714
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,497
Hello, Philip?

715
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,866
-Where you at?
-Sorry.

716
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,701
Look, if something isn't done soon,
I'll be married.

717
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,170
So why you wanna marry Philip?

718
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,175
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy.

719
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,649
I'm a practical girl.

720
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:08,886
l was brought up dirt-poor, wrong side
of Toledo, by not a very loving family.

721
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,987
I've put together a life for myself
based on good looks and street savvy.

722
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,901
l figure another five to seven years
to cash in. It's really all quite simple.

723
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,935
l mean, even the book
is theoretical. Just....

724
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,037
Don't fall in love.
That's the main thing.

725
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,234
Don't fall in love. It's dangerous.
Somebody could get hurt.

726
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,680
-Do you love Philip?
-No. l like him.

727
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,874
He's nice.
He's a likable guy.

728
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,315
But women don't love men
they can manipulate.

729
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,512
What about a man
that can manipulate you?

730
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,917
Well, if l find one...

731
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,693
...I'm sure I'll fall in love.

732
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,053
You need to break up with her
in public.

733
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,959
Do it at the post office, airport.

734
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,361
Banks are good.
Where there's security.

735
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,468
But you gotta come on
with the come on.

736
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,231
-You got to be assertive.
-l know, I've gotta be assertive here.

737
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,737
Yeah. Got to get you--

738
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:01,207
l didn't tell you about the face.

739
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,639
-What?
-You know about the face?

740
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,041
-No.
-The face of immutability.

741
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:09,378
That's where you drain all the emotion
off your face, like this here:

742
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:15,952
See? You don't show emotion, hard
for a person to be emotional with you.

743
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,320
This breaks the cycle
of facial expressions.

744
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,190
it gives off pain, anger and hurt.

745
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,931
-Yeah, keep that. Keep that. Keep that.
-Yeah.

746
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,626
Now, when you see her, you act,
you don't wait. You say, ''It's over.''

747
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,036
Philip.

748
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,813
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing. l want to break up.

749
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,987
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, l want to break up.

750
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,255
-Here?
-Yes, here.

751
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:48,947
Why here?

752
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,750
To avoid violence.

753
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,389
In a post office?

754
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,696
Philip, it's not you.
l know you.

755
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,961
-You're a FedEx man.
-Yeah, whatever.

756
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,866
-Well, it's not possible.
-Why not?

757
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,633
-Because we're getting engaged.
-The hell we are.

758
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,469
Look, l thought it all through...

759
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:11,408
...and it is the best thing to do.
it is the most generous thing to do.

760
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,583
l don't want to be generous.

761
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:17,048
Honey, I'm being generous,
not you.

762
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,017
Listen, let's face facts, Philip.

763
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,918
You are an aging, boring white guy.

764
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,686
Without me to define you,
you're invisible.

765
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,728
So in good conscience,
the loving person that l am...

766
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,901
...l could not really just
let you go.

767
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,469
-l just wanna break up.
-Of course you do.

768
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,369
Listen, we'll get a bottle of wine
and you can tell me all about it. Okay?

769
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,875
Come on. Come on. Buck up.

770
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,687
Rufus, my darling.

771
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,789
How's my little baby?

772
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,221
Rufus, it's me. Helen.

773
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,824
You stop that.

774
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,366
You have something
to say to me?

775
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,374
-Yeah.
-What?

776
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,681
You ever hear of this game,
the question game?

777
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,317
-No.
-It's real simple.

778
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,750
It's where you ask me a question,
l have to answer it truthfully.

779
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,288
l ask you a question,
and you have to answer it truthfully.

780
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,722
-Sounds slightly mean and dangerous.
-No.

781
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,395
How about l start it out?

782
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,429
What's your name again? Mary?

783
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,324
Nicky.

784
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,229
-Your turn.
-Okay.

785
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,404
What do you do?

786
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,270
l was an editor at <i>Spoil</i> magazine.

787
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:51,004
Then l wrote this handbook
on how to break up with your lover.

788
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,782
-How long have you known that?
-First night at the bar.

789
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,783
How long have you known
that my name wasn't Mary?

790
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,683
-Yesterday.
-So you didn't know that first night?

791
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,888
Hold on.

792
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,892
Why'd you go out with me?

793
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,129
Because you thought
l looked like Halle Berry.

794
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,733
-Who was that woman on the phone?
-l don't know.

795
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,234
No girlfriend in the shadows
with a frying pan?

796
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,269
Nope. None of that.

797
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,273
Do you love Evan?

798
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,609
l thought l did.

799
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,176
Once you knew who l was,
you planned to stop seeing me?

800
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,877
l can't do that. That's my cousin.
It's not right.

801
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,851
-But here you are.
-Here we are.

802
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,786
Why is that?

803
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,489
I'm crazy.

804
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,788
-How crazy?
-I'm crazy like:

805
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,632
Not a drop of blood.
What's a girl to think?

806
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,398
I'm bleeding internally.

807
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,339
Wait, wait.
Wait, Quincy, wait.

808
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,575
Wait. Maybe we shouldn't, Quincy.

809
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,686
-Why?
-You know why.

810
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,916
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

811
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,456
l gotta talk to him.

812
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:14,255
Yeah. lf we have wild sex tonight,
it would only complicate things.

813
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:15,795
Yeah, yeah. it would.

814
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,095
I'm tripping.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

815
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,293
You know what?
Maybe l should just go.

816
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,994
-You wanna go?
-You want me to?

817
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,639
-Not unless you want to.
-l don't.

818
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,309
-Don't go.
-Then why you bring it up?

819
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,937
-We could play a game.
-Naked Twister.

820
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,346
-No, l have a better game.
-Really?

821
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,177
-The fantasy game.
-The fantasy game.

822
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,323
-You sit over there. I'll be over here.
-All right.

823
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,118
You tell me one of
your favorite fantasies.

824
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:45,817
And I'll tell you one of mine.

825
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,621
-You can go first.
-Okay.

826
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:50,026
There's these baby chickens...

827
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,700
...and they're all oiled up.

828
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,629
You go first.
l gotta work mine out.

829
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,637
Okay. I'm asleep...

830
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,537
...in this...

831
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,337
...deep, beautiful sleep.

832
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,776
This stranger,
he comes into my bedroom.

833
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,507
And his lips....
And he tastes so sweet...

834
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,583
-...like a Now and Later.
-Grape?

835
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,277
-Grape.
-Yeah, grape.

836
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,050
And then his lips are slowly...

837
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,860
...moving down my body
from my neck...

838
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,255
...to my breasts...

839
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,360
...to my belly.

840
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:28,433
l just can barely
catch my breath and....

841
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,265
Oh, this-- It's like a slow...

842
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,669
...enormous explosion and--

843
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,742
Get off. What are you doing?

844
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,937
What? l--
The dream and the lips.

845
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,275
it was a fantasy.

846
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,744
-Oh, my....
-God.

847
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,452
You got me excited. l....

848
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,855
l was feeling....

849
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,092
-Oh, what the hell. Oh, God.
-Yeah.

850
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,874
Didn't work out, did it?

851
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,309
Somehow it turned into
a negotiation.

852
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,244
We started out far apart.

853
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,317
l wanted to break up,
she wanted to get engaged.

854
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,318
In the end, we forged a compromise.

855
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,252
-What was the compromise?
-We got engaged.

856
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,893
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

857
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,024
-So you still want to break up?
-More than ever.

858
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,366
You know l believe in straightforward
honesty and direct dealings?

859
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,539
l have deep respect
for your philosophy.

860
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,798
Damn all that.
We gonna write a letter.

861
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:42,671
The letter states you've broken up.
Hell, I'll even write it. All right?

862
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:46,747
After that, all you do is change your
phone numbers, answering machine.

863
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,442
Take a vacation for two weeks,
somewhere exotic only you know of.

864
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,144
Don't you wanna be somewhere
so you can be naked...

865
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,347
...run on the beach,
have fun and frolic?

866
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,356
Frolic all you want, then come back
and you change up.

867
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,621
Change your habits.
Change your schedule for about...

868
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,696
...six months.

869
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,572
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

870
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,435
-Well, l can do that.
-Run naked somewhere, can't you?

871
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,278
I've got an ass,
and I'm gonna show it.

872
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,175
lf it's what you want. l don't
wanna see it. Show your ass.

873
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,373
Okay, let's see some ass.

874
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:24,212
-Don't get naked right here.
-l can just run away!

875
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,814
All right. All right, man.
You scaring me.

876
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,652
You scar--
You are scaring me.

877
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:39,229
Evan. This cousin of yours
is a genius.

878
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,598
Don't forget to give me that letter.
About 7:00? All right.

879
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,865
-Adios.
-What you give him?

880
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:50,506
-l need to holler at you.
-Got something to show you.

881
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,546
-Watch your eyes. Watch your eyes.
-Nicky?

882
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,547
-Who else?
-Thought you broke it off.

883
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:59,916
Q, the deeper the hole, the bigger
the romantic gesture to crawl out of it.

884
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,556
And this is a big gesture.

885
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,589
-You think she's interested?
-l know.

886
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,021
-How you know?
-l know.

887
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,091
-Her friend told me.
-No, she didn't.

888
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,524
-She did.
-Her dude?

889
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,598
She's just using some loser
to get to me, the real prize.

890
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,735
-You think he's a loser?
-l know he is.

891
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,427
l don't believe that.
That she'd choose that.

892
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,166
Believe it. l know Nicky, right?
l see where she's going with this.

893
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,401
She likes little games,
and l play along.

894
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,240
-Some games kind of kinky, right?
-Oh, man.

895
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,542
-Why you doing this?
-l love the woman, that's why.

896
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,651
-You don't think it's a good idea?
-No.

897
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:34,812
Set you up. l knew you'd say that.
You're about being safe and in control.

898
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,491
And this....

899
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,854
-This is crazy, right?
-When?

900
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,221
The master plan goes down tonight.

901
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,393
I'm so brilliant.

902
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,300
How you doing?
I'm looking for Nicky Callas.

903
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,996
I'm a good fiend of hers,
Quincy Watson.

904
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:56,208
You know, she's out for a few hours,
but why don't you leave a message.

905
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,610
Sure. Can you tell me
where she went?

906
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,775
No. No idea.

907
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,076
Make sure she gets this.
This is important.

908
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,685
-Okay?
-Of course.

909
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,720
-Hi.
-Hey.

910
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,452
-Still on for tonight, aren't we?
-Sure.

911
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,102
-Nicky.
-No, it's Philip.

912
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,472
Are you bringing
that letter over yet?

913
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,979
-Yeah, I'm coming.
-Thank you, <i>muchacho.</i>

Surprise!

915
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,404
Well, l couldn't rush off to paradise
without celebrating a second printing.

916
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,510
Ladies and gentlemen,
Quincy Watson, author.

917
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,975
There he is, big-time, big-time.
Hey, l got a surprise for you.

918
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,585
It's in the back.

919
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:15,087
-You ain't seen Philip's girl, have you?
-l doubt she was invited.

920
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,485
-Good, good.
-Yeah.

921
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,422
-l thought you had to meet Nicky.
-It's being arranged.

922
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:21,457
Trust me, boy. No, hey, trust me.

923
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:25,691
Have l ever let you down?
Have l ever let you down?

924
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,862
-Hello, Quincy.
-Helen?

925
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,568
Yeah. What you doing here?

926
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,074
I'm back.

927
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,740
-Whose party is this?
-A friend's.

928
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:43,078
-l wanted to go to the movies.
-Don't be such a drag. it'll be fun.

929
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,138
it took me going away to realize...

930
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,902
...that it wasn't you
who needed to change...

931
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,305
...it was me.

932
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,404
You're perfect just...

933
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:14,810
...the way you are.

934
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,544
But l would do anything
to make it right again between us.

935
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,885
Amy, what have you done?

936
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,923
Oh, my God.

937
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,757
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

938
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,761
And you can either kiss me
or slap me.

939
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:36,438
l don't care.

940
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,035
Excuse me. Q.

941
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,271
l need to speak to you
for a minute. Now.

942
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,675
Oh, don't go.

943
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,451
Nicky's here. Yeah, yeah.
And Rita's here too.

944
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,382
-What?
-Oh, it's a long story, okay?

945
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:56,046
But l need you to go get Nicky
and bring her back here to me.

946
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,092
-I'll tell you how to recognize her.

947
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,829
-l don't see Evan anywhere.
-l can't believe you did this to me.

948
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:05,762
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, no. He's changed.

949
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:09,665
Okay, it was supposed to be
a surprise, but he has a ring.

950
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,504
-A ring of what?
-A diamond ring, silly.

951
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,104
You're psychotic.

952
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,147
Really psychotic.

953
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,750
-Well, that's harsh.
-Excuse me.

954
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,387
-Nicky. Hey, what's up?
-Quincy.

955
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,559
-You know what? Let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

956
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,819
l was thinking we'd bounce,

957
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:37,923
You know, have you seen the floors?
These floors are great.

958
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,602
-Who's that woman waving?
-She's looking at you.

959
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,632
Have you got the letter?

960
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,703
-Right here.
-Okay, Nicky.

961
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:48,104
-See you met Quincy already. Cool.

01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,644
-That's the girl.
-Hi.

01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,292
-Let's blow out these candles.

-You know, l don't--

972
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,910
Look, I've been seeing Nicky,
and l love her.

973
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:45,227
Hey, just met your muse
and your little ho.

974
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,665
You know what you are?
You're a walking, talking teratoma.

975
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,899
No, Nicky, Nicky. Wait.

976
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,514
Yo, Nick!

977
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,251
E! Wait!

978
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,984
E, E, hold up, man.
Look, it's not what you think.

979
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,123
l think you weren't thinking.

980
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,486
-l didn't know what--
-l don't give a damn.

981
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,528
You don't do that to blood. You don't
do that to family. You know the rules.

982
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,922
Yeah, l know you know.
Go to hell, man.

983
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,602
I'm gonna get her back, Q.
Stay away from her.

984
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,703
Dude.

985
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,568
<i>Going somewhere?</i>

986
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:33,512
Yeah, just a business trip. You know,
kind of a last-minute thing...

987
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,207
...to London, just--

988
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:39,618
Yeah, just--

989
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:43,121
-Well, the hotel pool, you know?
-You're allergic to chlorine.

990
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,555
-Not that bad.
-You stop breathing.

991
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:52,667
-Change the locks?
-Yeah. The key broke off inside the....

992
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,769
-But it....
-Is this letter addressed to me?

993
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,598
Perhaps you should just read it.

994
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:05,913
There's something l need to tell you,
but it may change your opinion of me.

995
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,881
I'm having an affair.

996
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,058
Famous Q.

997
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,627
What you doing,
and how'd you get in?

998
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,096
-l broke a window.
-Why you do that?

999
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,702
-Your little dog is very friendly.
-What are you doing here?

1000
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,637
Yo. What's your problem, man?

1001
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,544
Oh, damn. What the hell
is wrong with you, man?

1002
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,284
-Yo, Philip, I'm confused.
-You certainly are, because l know.

1003
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:49,515
-You know what?
-Rita told me about your indiscretions.

1004
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:52,489
He bit me. That animal.

1005
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,960
The way l listened to you.
The way l confided in you.

1006
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,896
-it wasn't me, l swear.
-Listen, ungrateful little misanthrope.

1007
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,731
lf you so much as look at Rita,
l will hire people to break you in two.

1008
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:05,964
Plus, I'm pulling your lousy book.

1009
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,143
Your self-help days are history.

1010
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,910
I'm gonna marry that girl,
and there's not...

1011
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,948
...a damn thing you can do
to stop me.

1012
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,725
Yeah, it's just....

1013
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,122
Yeah.

1014
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,639
Stop that.

1015
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:24,785
What?

1016
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,783
This?

1017
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,389
Fine.

1018
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,284
Here.

1019
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,957
Don't you threaten me.

1020
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,772
l want that thing put down.

1021
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,788
There won't be fights in here.
But if you do, keep that left up.

1022
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,295
-Then uppercut and a round--
-Can l help you?

1023
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,797
Yeah, l was wondering...

1024
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:17,462
...if l left my girlfriend's dog here,
could you find him a good home?

1025
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,937
-Come with me.
-All right. There you go.

1026
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,201
Got your own condo,
skylights, Jacuzzi.

1027
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:25,380
You gonna have mad freaks
up in here.

1028
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,982
Yeah, they all get three days,
but between me and you...

1029
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,744
...ain't none of them
get out of here alive.

1030
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:34,946
Let me know.

1031
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,181
-Honey, I'm home.
-Are you crazy?!

1032
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,383
-Get that thing away.
-Where my dogs at?

1033
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:13,788
God, it's so ugly.

1034
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,023
Fly back to Paris on this.

1035
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,326
Go get her, boys.

1036
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,044
-Nicky?
<i>- The person you're calling...</i>

1037
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,440
<i>...is unavailable.</i>

1038
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,255
-Yo, E, l gotta talk to you.
-Wait a minute.

1039
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,793
Before you start,
l have something l wanna say.

1040
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,132
-I'm getting married.
-No.

1041
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,633
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
No date yet, but it's going down.

1042
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,272
-You happy?
-Of course. It's a big day, but--

1043
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,965
And that's just good
because you know why?

1044
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,740
-l want you to be my best man.
-No, l can't.

1045
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,278
-Hey, Q. We go back.
-No, l can't. I'm serious.

1046
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,747
-She's here.
-She's here. She's here? For what?

1047
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:11,818
No.

1048
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,953
Quincy, this is Rita.
Rita, Quincy.

1049
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,087
Pleasure finally meeting you.
Heard a lot about you.

1050
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,162
You have no idea.

1051
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,891
-Yeah, what happened to Philip?
-Heart attack.

1052
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,904
What do you think?

1053
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,906
So pretty, isn't it?

1054
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:42,145
<i>Thankfully, it turned out</i>
<i>to be a fairly minor incident.</i>

1055
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,418
<i>But he needed to spend</i>
<i>a few days in the hospital.</i>

1056
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:52,822
<i>So there I was, nursing the poor soul</i>
<i>back to life when who walks in?</i>

1057
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,289
Oh, hey, is that the Angler contract
you got there?

1058
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,467
-Yeah, you know, I'll come back.
-No, just put it down.

1059
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,829
-Right here?
-Yeah, just here. Here is good.

1060
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,305
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?
Evan, this is Rita Monroe.

1061
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,032
Rita Monroe, Evan Fields.

1062
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,872
<i>Of course, I didn't know he was Evan.</i>
<i>I thought he was you.</i>

1063
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:17,785
<i>I felt so used,</i>
<i>so manipulated that I just...</i>

1064
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,111
...fell in love.

1065
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,814
-Is Philip still in the hospital?
-No, l fixed him up with this nurse.

1066
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,364
-Good boy.
<i>- He's in good hands.</i>

1067
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,999
Rita, will you excuse us
for a second?

1068
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,170
I'll see you outside.

1069
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,405
-What's crackulating?
-Talk to Nicky?

1070
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:44,306
Oh, no. Well, l stalked her for a while,
but that was a long time ago.

1071
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,310
-That's a joke. That's a joke.
-Good.

1072
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,210
Rita, nice to meet you.

1073
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,349
Q.

1074
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,688
You still need my permission
if you wanna talk to her.

1075
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,451
Them the rules.

1076
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,560
l got my own rules now, player.

1077
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,671
l can't believe he hit you in the ear.

1078
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,397
They deserve each other.

1079
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,541
Hello?

1080
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,253
-Hey, where's Nicky?
-She's not here.

1081
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,425
-When is she coming back?
-She's not.

1082
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:33,589
-What you mean, ''she's not''?
-She's gone to Portland.

1083
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,387
-Portland?
-You just missed her.

1084
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,588
She took the train. He's afraid to fly.

1085
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,733
He? Who the hell is he?

1086
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,435
Right here, Mr. Lynch.

1087
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,814
Don't move. Your daughter
doesn't pay me enough...

1088
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,246
...to play hide-and-seek with you.
All right?

1089
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,976
I'm gonna go get the tickets.
Stay here.

1090
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,269
Damn.

1091
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,005
Hi, two tickets
on the Surfliner to Portland.

1092
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,909
Come on.

1093
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,714
Damn.

1094
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,601
Nick.

1095
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,742
Nicky.

1096
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,992
-His right hand grabbed me like this.
-l see.

1097
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,023
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta go now.

1098
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:47,422
Let's go.

1099
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:07,846
Please have your tickets ready.

1100
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,076
Final destination for this train
is San Diego.

1101
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,978
What?

1102
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:32,703
Don't even think about it.

1103
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,550
What the...? Oh, my gosh.

1104
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,122
Quincy.

1105
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:56,994
-What are you doing?
-I'm a--

1106
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,497
-It's my fault. I'm an idiot.
-What are you--?

1107
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,726
l don't understand
what you're saying.

1108
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:04,770
Do you hear me?
What you with the old dude for?

1109
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:07,441
l can't understand what you're saying.

1110
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,243
I'm a misanthrope.
I'm an asshole. I'm a fool.

1111
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,108
-l can't hear you.
-l love you. l got to have you.

1112
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,287
What are you--?

1113
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,623
No, no, no.
No, no. No, don't.

1114
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,622
-Crazy man.
-Don't, don't.

1115
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,021
No, no, don't. Don't.

1116
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,254
Oh, my God! Stay here.
