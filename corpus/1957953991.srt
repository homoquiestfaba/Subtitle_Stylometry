0
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:14,186
Giblets, what's that like?

1
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,559
Good morning, beautiful girl.

2
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:52,664
Hi, mom.

3
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:54,390
Merry almost Christmas.

4
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:55,505
Do you need us to pick you up?

5
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:56,357
I'm happy to do it.

6
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:58,359
No, we're fine, we'll get a car.

7
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,396
I'm sure your
brother's available.

8
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,328
Joe, it's Maya.

9
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,330
Love you, miss you, can't do it.

10
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:04,917
I can't wait to meet Trent.

11
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,402
Hey, yeah, speaking of which...

12
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,921
Vashy, Maya's
calling from Boston.

13
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:09,888
Do you want to say
hi to your sister?

14
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,785
Just so you know...

15
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,203
Maya's got a boyfriend.

16
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,756
What's the brother's name again?

17
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,378
Trent.

18
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:19,011
And I know it's no big deal,
I'd just thought I'd mention...

19
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,416
Flight 143 to Baton Rouge,

20
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,694
boarding business
class and Columbia.

21
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,696
What was that, honey?

22
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,800
It doesn't matter.

23
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,389
Trent is psyched to meet y'all.

24
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,804
Gotta go.

25
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,736
Love you.

26
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:32,393
I love you.

27
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,538
Okay.

28
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,311
I finally get to meet
this Trent brother.

29
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:42,576
I've been stalking her social.

30
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,130
No pics.

31
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
Maybe he's famous.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,546
I bet he plays for the Celtics.

33
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:49,352
Or maybe Trent's a secret
service man or something,

34
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:51,378
like one of Obama's sons.

35
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:52,482
That'd be tight.

36
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:54,657
Maya dating some
future president.

37
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,970
Okay, A, Maya's going to
be the first black female

38
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,490
president all by herself.

39
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:01,940
And...

40
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,424
Obama's only got
daughters, dummy.

41
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,712
Whoever he is, he's got to be
some black panther ranget to be

42
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:06,186
with Maya.

43
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,463
Okay, okay, let's go.

44
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:08,923
Santa's going to be
here in 48 hours.

45
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:10,569
If you got 'em, wrap them.

46
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:11,639
If not...

47
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:12,502
Santa's going to put
coals in our stockings?

48
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:15,367
It's gonna be okay.

49
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,358
We're safer up there, you know?

50
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:41,600
What's that?

51
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,672
I read somewhere you're
safer in an airplane sitting

52
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,226
in your own apartment.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,440
Have a scone, calm your nerves.

54
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,890
I'm not nervous.

55
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,893
I'm just excited.

56
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,241
I'm a freaking wreck.

57
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,521
It's my first time
flying, you know.

58
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,809
But I'm thinking there's no way
that God's going to knock down a

59
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,940
plane carrying someone as
drop dead gorgeous as you on it.

60
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:16,256
Did you read that, too, or did
you just make it up on the spot?

61
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,154
Well, that's the thing
about romantic gestures,

62
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:22,641
feels spontaneous, but
they take a lot of work.

63
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:31,098
It's just a big deal, you know,
I'm taking my boyfriend home to

64
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:32,824
meet my family.

65
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:35,689
Flight 143
to Baton Rouge now boarding

66
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,035
all rows.

67
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,139
No sweat.

68
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,796
They're going to love me.

69
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,350
Damn straight.

70
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,464
So, that was wicked cool.

71
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,154
Yeah.

72
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,270
Yeah, maybe I'll become a pilot.

73
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,340
You'd miss too
many Red Sox games.

74
00:04:55,364 --> 00:04:57,642
Stupid idea, flying sucks.

75
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,229
Good, 'cause I like
having you around.

76
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,231
All right, here's
the 411 on my family.

77
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,302
Oh, no.

78
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,683
I know.

79
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:05,788
You took notes?

80
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:08,169
It helps me remember.

81
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,068
Plus, I write down
everything you say.

82
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,001
Kinda creepy.

83
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:14,728
See, okay, "kinda creepy."

84
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:15,591
Jerk.

85
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,627
Ow.

86
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:22,529
Seriously, you know, I
think it's important.

87
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:23,920
I don't take you to my uncle's
pizza party once a week for

88
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:26,774
the grinders.

89
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,225
My family loves you, Maya.

90
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,366
I kind of want the same thing.

91
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:37,682
Well, all right,
Mr. CIA, quiz time.

92
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,891
Tell me about Vashy.

93
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,145
Vashy, short for Navasha,
some lake in East Africa you did

94
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,722
a bunch of research at.

95
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,172
Yeah.

96
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,667
She's 16 going on
30, takes 100 selfies a day.

97
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,278
Okay.

98
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:50,049
Pretty good snapshot of
the family narcissist.

99
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,592
God bless her.

100
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,629
What about Joe?

101
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:58,012
Short for... no, Joe
is named after Jomo Kenyatta,

102
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:03,017
the George Washington of Kenya.

103
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,433
Yeah.

104
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,503
He's 22.

105
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,368
Super cool, into
music like your dad.

106
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,576
Trying to get into hip hop.

107
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,924
You forgot his stage name, OBG.

108
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,304
OBG.

109
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,548
Not bad, Mr.
Thomas, not bad.

110
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,344
Let's see, who we got next?

111
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,460
Got your cranky, cute Grandma
Hattie who lives with you guys

112
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,624
in the house,
owned by your uncle,

113
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,143
the dentist.

114
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,627
Doc, he loves to be called Doc.

115
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:27,663
Doc, right.

116
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:31,218
Who lives next door with
your Aunt Dee for Deana.

117
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:33,496
Basically a 1950's homemaker.

118
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,431
There are two kids,
Alyssa and Matthew.

119
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:40,607
And she's, what, sophomore
at the local HBCU college.

120
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,436
Wardwell.

121
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,749
Yes.

122
00:06:44,783 --> 00:06:45,059
All girls, good school, did two
years there before I transferred

123
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,406
to Brown.

124
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,717
And it's HBCU.

125
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,168
Good catch, good catch, yeah.

126
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,309
That leaves us to
your cousin Matthew.

127
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,207
He's a high school
senior computer geek.

128
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:57,037
Little quiet, a bit
awkward, wears mascara.

129
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:58,245
I never said that.

130
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,591
I know, I'm messing with you.

131
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:02,594
How did I do?

132
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,598
Okay, fine, you get an A-.

133
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,048
A-.

134
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:10,326
But here's what you don't know.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,328
There's a little tension
between the families.

136
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:15,158
My dad and his brother
are always really tight,

137
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,540
but very different.

138
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:21,475
So, my dad was this liberal
professor of Afrocentric music

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,133
and he married a
community activist.

140
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,928
I thought your mom was a CPA?

141
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,206
Only since my dad died.

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,002
Then there's Doc and Dee.

143
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,452
Conservative, kind of stuff.

144
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:35,385
It's been a tough couple years
with living right next door to

145
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,111
Doc and Dee.

146
00:07:37,146 --> 00:07:40,874
Oh, Renee, I love your
robe, so imaginative.

147
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,082
Tea?

148
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:44,118
No, thanks, just the pan, Dee.

149
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,051
Kind of a constant
reminder what she once had.

150
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,883
All right.

151
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:52,057
There.

152
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,656
Wow, you've outdone
yourself this Christmas.

153
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,406
Thank you.

154
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,167
Okay, thanks.

155
00:07:58,201 --> 00:07:59,420
Remember Maya's
bringing her new boyfriend.

156
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:01,342
So...

157
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:02,975
Oh, would you like him to
bunk upstairs with Matthew?

158
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,518
They aren't married, are they?

159
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,491
They're adults,
so no, thank you.

160
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,528
Well, at least come
over for dinner tonight.

161
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,599
We'd love to meet him.

162
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,464
Yeah, okay, thank you.

163
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,879
Great.

164
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:24,814
And don't bring anything, I know
cooking isn't really your thing.

165
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,402
Bye-bye now.

166
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:31,856
It never
bothered us kids though,

167
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,271
we were all really close.

168
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,653
Things got kind of ugly
when my dad got sick.

169
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:41,624
See, we supported a liberal
candidate for city council and

170
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,732
my aunt and uncle supported
and backed this republican,

171
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,078
a white guy.

172
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:50,599
No offense.

173
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:53,671
So, of course it's fine.

174
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,913
So, both sides kin of dug in.

175
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:58,434
Now, five years later and they
both refuse to take down those

176
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,747
stupid signs.

177
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,886
Families are complicated.

178
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,001
Why should yours
be any different?

179
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,303
What?

180
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,556
Something my dad
would have said.

181
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:11,205
I wish I could have met him.

182
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,621
Me too.

183
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,277
But you'll really like my mom.

184
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:18,040
She's cool, super
smart, kind of intense,

185
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,043
but chill at the same time.

186
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,183
Sounds like somebody I know.

187
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,116
Who does that sound like?

188
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,600
And there are the signs.

189
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:29,396
Thank you.

190
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,985
You too.

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,406
Home sweet home.

192
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,650
Don't be nervous,
just be yourself,

193
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,411
and don't mention
you're a libertarian.

194
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,895
What was that?

195
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:49,589
Come on, oh, my God.

196
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,730
Don't be surprised
if they seem surprised.

197
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,007
Why?

198
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,157
No big deal, but I might have
forgotten to tell them that

199
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,011
you're whi... hi!

200
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:03,430
HI.

201
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,677
How much she pay
you to play along?

202
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:12,646
And what did you
do to your hair?

203
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:17,582
Everybody, this is
Trent Thomas, my boyfriend.

204
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,033
What?

205
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,079
I'm Trent, how are you doing?

206
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,726
Sure, okay, please come in?

207
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,694
Can I offer you a beverage?

208
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,592
A beer perhaps?

209
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,593
I got it, I'm good.

210
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,663
No worries.

211
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,424
Okay.

212
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,495
Hi, Trent, nice to meet you.

213
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,050
Oh, you guys,
this is just too kind.

214
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:41,054
Trent was it?

215
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:43,746
Merry Christmas, Maya.

216
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,855
I love your
home, Mrs. Greyson.

217
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,063
Please, call me Renee.

218
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:52,652
The apartment that I grew
up in could literally

219
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,514
fit inside this room.

220
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:59,417
Oh, is that a... I
know what that is,

221
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,601
it's a kora from West Africa,
your husband wrote about

222
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,764
that, right?

223
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,904
Are you musically
inclined, Trent?

224
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:06,631
No, God, I can't sing a note.

225
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,091
Maya's got a sweet ole
set of pipes though.

226
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,392
Gran Hattie.

227
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,532
Merry Christmas.

228
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,051
You look great.

229
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,192
Baby, you're here.

230
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,643
Trent, this is my grandmother.

231
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,577
So nice to meet you.

232
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,544
Excuse me, son.

233
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,754
I'm just wondering what
the hell you're doing here.

234
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:27,341
Gran, I invited him.

235
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,860
I wanted him to meet y'all.

236
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,413
You invited him?

237
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:32,737
Yeah, and vice versa, I wanted
to come and see how the other

238
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:37,489
half lived.

239
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,251
The other half lives?

240
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:44,565
Oh, I meant Maya,
my better half.

241
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,293
Why don't you put
down your book bag, Trent.

242
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:50,986
Make yourself comfortable and
we'll go see about that coke.

243
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,436
Joe, Maya.

244
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:13,940
That is a wicked festive scarf.

245
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,472
Maya, why didn't you tell us?

246
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,635
That was weird.

247
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:21,361
I'll say.

248
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:25,054
Offering him beer at
2:30 in the afternoon?

249
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,608
Can I have a beer?

250
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:28,989
No.

251
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,035
Why you leaving him with gran?

252
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,957
I was scared.

253
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,579
What?

254
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:33,798
Ever since I saw Get Out,
I'm scared of white people.

255
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,996
Next thing he's gonna say
is his best friend is black.

256
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,101
All of y'all stop it.

257
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,034
Get out there and act normal.

258
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,036
You hear that?

259
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,522
She said get out, told y'all.

260
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:50,504
When I was your age,
black folks and white folks

261
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:51,701
didn't date.

262
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,082
Oh, my.

263
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,327
Well, they did, but you
know, it was on the side.

264
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:00,434
Maybe it was because I married
my husband when I was 20 and he

265
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:01,435
was black.

266
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,783
Gran.

267
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,439
Cracker?

268
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,406
Excuse me?

269
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,993
That's what I was thinking.

270
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,408
Joe?

271
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:09,868
Just wanted to know if
he would want a cracker.

272
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,307
Oh.

273
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:14,517
Yeah, sure.

274
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,210
Thanks.

275
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:20,316
You know, back then they used
to call us colored instead

276
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,835
of black.

277
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,079
I learnt that in history class.

278
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,666
Did you ever
study history, Trent?

279
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,323
Can we change the subject?

280
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:28,611
Listen to y'alle I'm just
babbling on and on and on.

281
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:33,433
Trent, is Maya the first
black girl you ever dated?

282
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:34,710
Gran?

283
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:37,506
Like it never
crossed your mind at some point.

284
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,542
It's fine, it's
fine, Gran Hattie.

285
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:44,824
Actually, when I look at
Maya I don't see a black woman.

286
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,999
I'm... I'm sorry, what?

287
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,148
I see a brilliant woman
with a beautiful soul.

288
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:02,842
Isn't that sweet?

289
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:10,228
You know what they say, honey,
once you go black you never

290
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,712
go back.

291
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,128
Okay.

292
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,234
Okay, let's get you settled.

293
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,824
You can come with me upstairs?

294
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,759
I think Trent might be more
comfortable at Doc and Dee's.

295
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,934
Momma, what?

296
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,452
He is not staying here.

297
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,039
Why?

298
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,178
Because I don't know.

299
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:34,114
Trent, why don't you follow me?

300
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,841
I need to meet
them anyways, right?

301
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,946
Yes, you do.

302
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,258
Please, come with me, Trent.

303
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,157
Let's just... its' just over
here.

304
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,503
It's not far at all.

305
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:45,850
See you guys later.

306
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,300
Thanks for the coke.

307
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:48,818
Cool.

308
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:59,484
Maya, sweetheart, welcome home.

309
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,830
Oh, pretty as ever.

310
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:01,797
Thank you.

311
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:03,868
And you must be her new beau.

312
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,121
Mrs. Greyson, I'm Trent Thomas.

313
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:05,905
Nice to meet you.

314
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,182
Call me Auntie Dee.

315
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,079
Everyone else does.

316
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:10,219
Come in, come in.

317
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,775
So, you changed your mind.

318
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm so glad you did.

319
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,997
Go on you too, up the
stairs, last door on your right.

320
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:19,953
Maya knows.

321
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,437
Go on, go on.

322
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:27,305
Well, well, well, guess who's
coming to Christmas dinner.

323
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,969
Well, that wasn't weird at all.

324
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,214
Yeah, I promise, they're
not usually like that.

325
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:43,114
That was wicked uncomfortable.

326
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,496
I feel like a freaking tool.

327
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,188
Did you tell them I
was coming or exist?

328
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,952
Yes, of course, sorta.

329
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:57,749
I mean, I tried.

330
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:01,926
No, I'm sorry.

331
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,272
Get comfortable.

332
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,998
It's going to be fine.

333
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:13,247
Whew.

334
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:16,906
I just think it's
so mature of her,

335
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,046
don't you?

336
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,047
Yeah, uh huh.

337
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,014
Something like that.

338
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,190
To think, Maya, winner
of the Rosa Parks Award,

339
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:27,262
president of the Afro Am club.

340
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:30,368
And didn't she quit vanilla ice
cream because it was too white?

341
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:35,960
Listen, I know Maya and
this is just a phase.

342
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,342
Trust me.

343
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,516
It's good.

344
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,221
Okay, this is a little more
complicated than I figured.

345
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,819
We're going to have
to divide and conquer.

346
00:16:56,843 --> 00:16:58,017
What are we talking about?

347
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,191
You ever go to the
arcade and shoot the BB gun?

348
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:02,952
Maya, can we just focus here?

349
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,679
I'm saying we pick 'em off.

350
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:08,061
It's like the shooting gallery.

351
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,374
You get enough
targets, you get the prize.

352
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,755
I've got what, like,
eight family members here.

353
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,171
You're going to win them over.

354
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:18,727
We're going to win
them over one at a time.

355
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,729
Do you trust me?

356
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:22,731
I do.

357
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:23,697
I do.

358
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,009
Good.

359
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,183
Take out your notebook.

360
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,668
We're going to
start with Auntie Dee.

361
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:29,945
We're sunk if we can't get her.

362
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,291
Okay, and then?

363
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:32,844
We work our way up to my mom.

364
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:37,135
Auntie Dee takes care of
everybody else so often I think

365
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,059
she's forgot who she is.

366
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,751
Her one secret vice is sports.

367
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,169
How you doing?

368
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,689
Wow, oh, goodness.

369
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:50,724
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

370
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,659
You scared me half to death.

371
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:59,043
I'm just not used to seeing
strange people in the house.

372
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,806
So, Dee, what's going on here?

373
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,222
I hear you're quite the cook.

374
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:08,294
Well, I'm making
dinner for you and Maya.

375
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,744
Maya was right about
you, you're far too kind,

376
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,575
as if letting me bunk
here is not enough.

377
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,715
Well, we're eager
to get to know you.

378
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:19,684
Well, tonight, okay,
you take a load off.

379
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,617
Please, you're a
guest, I insist.

380
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:23,768
You don't even have to worry,
I was practically raised in a

381
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,829
diner and I would consider it
an honor if I can take this one

382
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:28,141
little burden off your plate.

383
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:30,350
All right, settled.

384
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:33,595
Here you go.

385
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,734
Madame.

386
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,701
My, this is a treat.

387
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:42,949
After you.

388
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:46,573
Okay.

389
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:47,678
And the clicker.

390
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:48,610
Thank you.

391
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,750
What channel is ESPN
on down here?

392
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:53,684
I think they got a
Hurricane game starting up.

393
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,926
I'm not much into hockey.

394
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,239
If there's
anything else you need.

395
00:18:57,274 --> 00:19:00,035
Not unless you've
got 20 bucks to lose.

396
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,056
Hey, momma.

397
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,231
Hey, hon, what you doing?

398
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:26,958
Oh, just packing up some goodies
for the food drive tomorrow.

399
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,926
Oh, just like old times.

400
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,583
Just like old times.

401
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,481
Want some help?

402
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,207
Of course.

403
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:37,003
So, only five more months
until you're a lawyer, huh?

404
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:38,867
How's that feel?

405
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,672
I'm feelin pretty good, but I'm
not actually going to be a lawyer

406
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:41,766
until I pass the bar.

407
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,941
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

408
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,736
Found out where
you want to work?

409
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,532
I bet the Louisiana ACLU
would want to hire you back

410
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,843
in a second.

411
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:52,743
Mom, they never worked there, I
volunteered back in high school.

412
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,642
Still.

413
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:56,609
Well, there's always the
Baton Rouge Coalition,

414
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,887
the NAACP.

415
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,648
And I still have my close
connection in the United Way.

416
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,582
Mom, you remember that law firm
that I did my summer internship

417
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,654
at last year in Boston?

418
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:08,828
They made me an offer.

419
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,520
What, Suffer, Shallow and Mean?

420
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:12,832
Mom.

421
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:16,111
Sanford, Shale and Maine, mom.

422
00:20:16,145 --> 00:20:21,841
As if Maya Greyson would
ever go the corporate route.

423
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,774
As if.

424
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:24,809
All done.

425
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,022
He really did love Christmas.

426
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:37,926
Decorations, songs, presents,
mostly just having time to spend

427
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,929
with all of us, right?

428
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:51,905
Give Trent a chance because
he's really important to me.

429
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,599
Of course, baby, of course.

430
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,841
Thank you.

431
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,569
First over to Wayne.

432
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:03,020
Top of the circle,
slap shot by Hosington.

433
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,471
Picks it up for
the Mountaineers.

434
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,474
What in the world
are you making?

435
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:12,478
I've got pot roast,
au gratin potatoes,

436
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,859
string beans with
pistachios and chives,

437
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:16,654
and for dessert,
cherries jubilee.

438
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,000
Will you marry me?

439
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,623
What?

440
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,763
Crazy impressive, honey.

441
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:26,837
And that apron is sexy, no
matter what anybody else says.

442
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,771
Oh, really?

443
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,187
You know what we should do now?

444
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,512
Forks on the left, spoons
and knives on the right.

445
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,918
Like I said, they
are very formal.

446
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:41,161
Sorry.

447
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,680
Suppers at my
house were more like,

448
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:43,968
do you want cheese or pepperoni?

449
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,304
Don't beat yourself up.

450
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,616
Now, looks like we're
one down, seven to go.

451
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,755
You got this?

452
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,756
You don't need my help?

453
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,655
You go shower, I'll
figure out who's next.

454
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:52,828
Okay.

455
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,875
Greetings, you must be Trent.

456
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:05,876
That would make you Matthew.

457
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,912
Indeed.

458
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:08,741
Maya tells me you're into I-T.

459
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:09,811
Say it.

460
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:10,743
Say what?

461
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:11,777
It, I... T, it.

462
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,714
I know how to spell it,
I don't know what it is.

463
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,096
If it...

464
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,925
You know what,
let's just start over.

465
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,651
Maya tells me you are into...

466
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:24,457
Information technologies
should be abbreviated to IT,

467
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,621
not I-T.

468
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:29,382
Saves a syllable, like
ASAP instead of A-S-A-P,

469
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:34,214
or RSVP, instead of R-S-V-P.

470
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,184
If everybody calls I-T IT, we'll
save thousands of man hours over

471
00:22:38,218 --> 00:22:39,737
the next century.

472
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:43,672
Then again, think of all the
man hours spent explaining it to

473
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:47,158
chowderheads like me.

474
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:48,884
Hey, this is a wicked cool room.

475
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:49,851
Hey, are you into sailing?

476
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:54,890
No, no, no, no.

477
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,927
Water makes me seasick.

478
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,205
Things aren't
always what they seem.

479
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,587
I'm getting that vibe.

480
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:04,624
Lotus blossom,
that sounds riveting.

481
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:06,291
So, you're
romantically tied to my cousin.

482
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:09,698
Well, we met at the BC Library.

483
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,769
That's short for
Boston College, by the way.

484
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:13,012
I get it.

485
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,230
Well, we're having
supper with your folks.

486
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:15,601
Pot roast, are you hungry?

487
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,743
I don't eat meat, plus I
have to tend to my garden.

488
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:23,471
Well, our loss and thanks for
letting me crash in your place,

489
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:24,851
by then way.

490
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:27,613
That's... I figured it out.

491
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,754
I'm rethinking the
whole I-T, it thing.

492
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:33,619
No, no, no, not that it, you
it, the sand garden,

493
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:36,553
the incense, the lotus blossom,
the no-meat thing.

494
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:38,865
And that is not a
captains wheel.

495
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,040
That's a... what do
you call that?

496
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:44,630
That's a dama wheel.

497
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,872
You're a Buddhist.

498
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,307
No, I'm not.
And don't tell anybody.

499
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,117
That's cool, man.

500
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,031
And there's nothing
wrong with being a Buddhist.

501
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,536
Okay, okay, I'm a Buddhist, just
keep your voice down before my

502
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,815
mother hears.

503
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:05,850
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

504
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,414
Buddhist in Christian household
would be wise to keep

505
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,140
yin yang shut.

506
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,798
It's not that I'm
ashamed or anything, but...

507
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:17,386
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

508
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,492
You be you.

509
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:23,565
I'll be quieter than the
sound of one hand clapping.

510
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,843
Okay.

511
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:31,953
I'm gonna... I'm
gonna freshen up.

512
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:35,232
Thank you, roomie.

513
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:54,907
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a happy New Year. ♪

514
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:56,495
Whoa.

515
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,291
What's that for?

516
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:02,880
That's about two down
and about six to go.

517
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:07,885
Matthew seems shy, but he's
actually got a lot of nirvana.

518
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,160
Hmm, well, I'm glad you're
feeling feisty because up next

519
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,237
is my Uncle Doc and he's going
to try to eat you for dinner.

520
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,963
Come on.

521
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:23,211
So, Trent, did you
also study law school?

522
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:24,523
No, sir.

523
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:27,353
I'm in the production and
distribution of protein bars.

524
00:25:27,387 --> 00:25:29,182
Trent started his own company.

525
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:31,288
Well, I co-started.

526
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:34,015
We're in supermarkets and
packies and service stations

527
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,120
from Providence to Benga.

528
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:37,984
Service stations.

529
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,298
So, did you study
business in school?

530
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,896
I went to Northeastern
on a hockey scholarship.

531
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,026
Ah, an athlete.

532
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,892
Tomorrow is the
beginning of our Reindeer Games,

533
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,376
neighborhood touch football.

534
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,377
Killer, yeah.

535
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:56,831
So, I started as
a business major.

536
00:25:56,865 --> 00:26:00,041
After two years I just thought,
get out there and do it, right?

537
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,629
I mean, it worked
for Bill Gates.

538
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:07,117
Yeah, it kind of did.

539
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,568
I always thought
about going back though.

540
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,053
Maya, didn't you write about how
business drove more people to

541
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,226
poverty than it helps?

542
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:15,125
That was in ninth grade, mom.

543
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,920
Poverty sucks.

544
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:22,408
The great thing about America is
with hard work and a stick-to-it

545
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:25,066
attitude, anybody can succeed.

546
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,276
Dr. Greyson, you
are a prime example.

547
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:34,213
Well, Trent, it's just a bit
more complicated than that.

548
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:38,286
You do know that slavery
was driven by capitalism, right?

549
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,324
Yeah, of course, my Irish
ancestors faced their...

550
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,191
Trent, baby, it's not
really the same thing.

551
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,204
Well, God, no, no, I didn't
mean it like that at all.

552
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:51,851
Why don't we take our seats?

553
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:54,440
Yeah, that's a good idea.

554
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,445
It's okay, baby.

555
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,038
My, oh my, Trent.

556
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:07,867
This looks great.

557
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:10,111
Please, it was nothing.

558
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:13,079
Do you mind if I
do the honors, sir?

559
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:16,945
I'll never say no
to a man who prays.

560
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,466
Bless us, oh Lord, in these, thy
gifts in which we are about to

561
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,917
receive from thy bounty
through Christ our Lord, amen.

562
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,884
Amen.

563
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:31,753
And, Lord, please bless this
family with a very safe and very

564
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:32,892
Merry Christmas.

565
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:36,344
Amen.

566
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,794
All righty then.

567
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:39,140
Let's eat.

568
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,315
So, how did you two meet?

569
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,903
Last May...

570
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:49,219
May 15th at 4:04
p.m., to be exact.

571
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:53,154
You see, BC has got this wicked
lecture series on business.

572
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:56,329
So, I like to sneak in
and just listen sometimes.

573
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:58,169
I'm at the library, I'm
sitting at the long table.

574
00:27:58,193 --> 00:27:59,436
At the side of the table.

575
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,989
Uh huh.

576
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:02,508
That's right, that's right.

577
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:07,306
I see Maya, smoking hot.

578
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,618
All of the sudden
she starts crying.

579
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,655
It's true.

580
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,277
So, I'm feeling terrible.

581
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:14,934
They call that white guilt.

582
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:16,764
Hmm.

583
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,250
So, I say, what's wrong?

584
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:21,917
I had this product
liability class that I hated,

585
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:25,289
it was so stressful.

586
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:28,465
So, I said, sometimes the best
way to learn something is by

587
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,328
teaching it.

588
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:31,951
And we spend the night together.

589
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:32,952
Studying.

590
00:28:32,987 --> 00:28:35,265
The whole syllabus.

591
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,751
I'm learning about airbags
and aspirin bottles,

592
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:39,752
the whole thing.

593
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:42,099
It was so sweet.

594
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,377
She gets an A on the exam.

595
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,412
Ooh, hoo.

596
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:47,484
Bravo.

597
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,245
And so, love
blossomed in Boston.

598
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,697
Well, that took some doing.

599
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,803
I was starting my
summer associates position.

600
00:28:55,837 --> 00:28:57,874
I take her to Fenway.

601
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:58,920
I take her to
Candle Pin Bowling,

602
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,704
Cannoli's in Little Italy.

603
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,567
I'm getting no where.

604
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,707
Finally I pull
out all the stops.

605
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,571
I get tickets to Boston Pops.

606
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:09,333
Fourth of July,
orchestra, fireworks.

607
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:11,888
Right, and afterwards we go
dancing on the steps of the

608
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:13,717
steps of the statehouse.

609
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,616
No music, just her and I.

610
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:17,894
That was it.

611
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:25,004
I don't know if I'll be
able to eat again before

612
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,626
New Years.

613
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:30,285
You know, Trent's family is
in the restaurant business.

614
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,876
Yes, my uncle owns a pizza
joint and my dad runs a diner.

615
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:37,327
Oh, what about your mom?

616
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,915
My mom's a cop.

617
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,192
Oh.

618
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,786
And they just love Maya.

619
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,408
They just love her.

620
00:29:49,442 --> 00:29:52,066
When I told my mom that she's
taking that job at the fancy law

621
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,861
firm and moving up permanently.

622
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:57,209
God, she was just
she flipped.

623
00:29:57,243 --> 00:30:02,662
I mean, over the moon.

624
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:03,767
Flipped in a good way.

625
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,977
Oh, my.

626
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:08,254
Thank you for dinner.

627
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,677
Trent spoke out of turn, mom.

628
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:18,955
It's not a done deal.

629
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:22,372
I'm just weighing my options.

630
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,789
I'm looking for the girl
your father and I raised.

631
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,757
Let me know when she shows up.

632
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:31,968
Momma?

633
00:30:36,282 --> 00:30:38,319
I'm saying you shouldn't
have talked about the job.

634
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,182
Why not?

635
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:41,011
It's an awesome job.

636
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:43,013
It's complicated.

637
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:47,707
My mom has expectations,
different expectations.

638
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:49,226
She's harder than I thought.

639
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,608
It's like your family's
never seen a white guy before.

640
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,781
My family's not racist.

641
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,749
Look who's in
town for the holidays.

642
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:55,784
Hey.

643
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:56,855
How are you?

644
00:30:58,235 --> 00:30:59,305
Good, how are you?

645
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,068
Trent, this is
Shaundra and Cubby.

646
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:06,623
Are you psyched for Santa Claus?

647
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,487
Will you be there tomorrow for

648
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:09,729
Reindeer Games tomorrow?

649
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:10,799
Oh, for sure.

650
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,215
Okay.

651
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,493
Polar Bears versus
Reindeer, I wouldn't miss it.

652
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:15,597
Ho, ho, ho.

653
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:16,978
Good night.

654
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:18,048
Good night.

655
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,637
Good night, Cubby.

656
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:21,672
You remember Maya.

657
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,295
The kid's adorable.

658
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:30,578
Yeah, she's been really good to
my mom since my dad passed away.

659
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:33,581
He really would have liked you.

660
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:35,203
Oh, really?

661
00:31:35,238 --> 00:31:39,207
Professor of African music would
be okay with white Trent Thomas

662
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:43,936
from Boston, Mass,
whose mom is a cop?

663
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,800
When you put it that way?

664
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:52,186
I'm sorry about the job thing.

665
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,947
It's not your fault.

666
00:31:54,982 --> 00:32:00,573
Oh, boy, you're right,
it's hard.

667
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:04,094
My mom, I just
don't understand her.

668
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:05,958
Maybe I should talk to her?

669
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:10,618
No, you worry about Vashy and
Joe and talk to Alyssa when she

670
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,722
gets home tomorrow.

671
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:14,760
I'll worry about my mom.

672
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:16,624
Goodnight, Miss Greyson.

673
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,463
Hey, mom.

674
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:29,223
What you doing?

675
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:33,123
Working.

676
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:35,298
If you're still angry
about the job thing?

677
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:38,680
You're a big girl, you
can do whatever you like.

678
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:39,854
Okay.

679
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,961
It's just you've changed, Maya.

680
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,939
If you mean I'm not the same
little girl who used to do

681
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,034
everything you
told her, then yeah.

682
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,656
It's this Trent fellow.

683
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,589
He seems nice enough.

684
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:52,049
Weren't you the one
who told me to be bold,

685
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:53,902
take some risks?

686
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,836
For a few weeks, maybe.

687
00:32:56,871 --> 00:33:00,116
But this has been going
on since last spring, Maya.

688
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,808
You promised me you were
going to give him a chance.

689
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:04,741
He's amazing.

690
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,501
He makes me feel...

691
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:07,606
What?

692
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,505
Happy.

693
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,612
For the first time
since daddy died.

694
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:17,857
When I'm with him, it's
it feels like I'm home.

695
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:20,860
Like he's home.

696
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:22,345
That's nice.

697
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,968
Really.

698
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,625
Just don't lead him on, okay.

699
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:27,971
Lead him on?

700
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,766
Don't let him
think it's serious.

701
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,633
Mom, it is serious.

702
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,467
A man who says when he
looks at you he doesn't

703
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:38,119
see a black woman?

704
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:40,984
And everything
that means, I mean, Maya.

705
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,676
He sees me.

706
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:44,781
Me.

707
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,645
He can't see you.

708
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,651
Is it because he's white?

709
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:54,377
No, no, Maya.

710
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,526
Is that what
you're worried about?

711
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,794
I'm worried about you.

712
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:03,041
Trent is... is a symptom.

713
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:07,597
A symptom, that's
really nice, a symptom.

714
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:18,366
Nice job, Renee.

715
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,680
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

716
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,647
No, they're coming around.

717
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:25,787
Your mom?

718
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:28,756
Well...

719
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,791
It's me isn't it?

720
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:32,449
It's because I'm a JP rat
who didn't go to an

721
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:33,588
Ivy League school?

722
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:35,383
It's not you.

723
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,603
When my dad died, she had to
take that CPA job and had to put

724
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:41,665
all her community
projects on hold.

725
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,840
She put them on me.

726
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,877
Apparently I'm the
George Bear in this family.

727
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,329
You're at the top of your class,
job offers coming out the wazoo.

728
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:51,479
I mean, if I had a
daughter like you,

729
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,756
I would be doing a
freaking cartwheel.

730
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,471
Thank you.

731
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:59,097
But there's a difference
between accolades and activism.

732
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:04,688
Oh, no no no, I got it.
It's heavy.

733
00:35:04,723 --> 00:35:06,518
My parents were married here.

734
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:07,760
We'll be back.

735
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:20,048
Wow, this is beautiful.

736
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:23,742
Yeah, my mom
really wasn't a church goer,

737
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,745
but daddy was.

738
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:30,887
You think if you
ever got married

739
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,062
that you would
want a church wedding?

740
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:37,825
You know, I never
really gave it much thought.

741
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:43,727
But who you marry is much
more important than where.

742
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:52,357
You're going to
get through this.

743
00:35:52,391 --> 00:35:55,670
Somehow your family
resists my good looks and charm?

744
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:58,328
Well, I'll blow them away
with my football skills.

745
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,607
Even if I am white.

746
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,648
It's not because he's white.

747
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,270
I couldn't care less.

748
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,514
Yet this is the third
time you've mentioned it.

749
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:14,275
Have you met my husband?

750
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,104
About 6'1", kind
of skinny, white.

751
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,797
You know me better than that.

752
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,454
I love him like a brother.

753
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,628
Okay, what is it?

754
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:23,767
I don't know.

755
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:26,322
He's all Boston.

756
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:31,154
Thinks everybody's his friend.

757
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:36,539
Bouncing around all nice
and smiley and happy and...

758
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,231
Sounds like monster.

759
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:43,201
He's just wrong for her.

760
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,893
I just wish he was more like...

761
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:49,483
Like Eli?

762
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:52,624
Look, if you're sure he's wrong,
speak now or forever hold

763
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:54,142
your peace.

764
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,877
You, you were a walk on at
Northeastern hockey scholarship.

765
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,914
What is this?

766
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:08,167
It's touch
football, this is nothing,

767
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,779
this is nothing, it's great.

768
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:11,884
Preser Freden Kay.

769
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:16,889
You got this.

770
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:19,754
Merry Christmas.

771
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,273
You must be Alysssa.

772
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:23,827
I'm Trent, Maya's boyfriend.

773
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:24,966
Nice to meet you.

774
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:26,520
Playing in the
Reindeer Games, right?

775
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:28,004
I got these for you.
Let me get this

776
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,869
Let's go, okay.

777
00:37:30,903 --> 00:37:34,907
All right.

778
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:44,952
You know, I don't
know where to put this.

779
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:46,022
Just okay, hold tight.

780
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,137
I'm going to put the cups down.

781
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:48,783
I'll help you.

782
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:49,991
Okay.

783
00:37:50,026 --> 00:37:53,719
Good morning Mr. Tracy.

784
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:57,378
Hey, Joe, who's your friend?

785
00:37:57,413 --> 00:38:00,036
Eric.

786
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,796
What are you doing here?

787
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:04,730
Ah, Maya, I've missed you, too.

788
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:06,801
And thanks, you're looking
pretty fly yourself.

789
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:09,908
Come on, Reindeer Games, my
favorite holiday tradition.

790
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:11,599
And I'm 3-0.

791
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,808
Okay.

792
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:15,016
Hey, hey, let's go over here.

793
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:16,570
Who's that?

794
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:17,640
Who, what?

795
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:19,262
That tall one.

796
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,919
Eric.

797
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,714
Eric, as in your boyfriend Eric?

798
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:23,760
As in my ex-boyfriend Eric.

799
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:24,784
Yeah.

800
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,072
I thought he was in England.

801
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,029
Some Rhodes Scholarships
only last a year.

802
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,066
He's a Rhodes Scholar, too?

803
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,654
I didn't know he was coming.

804
00:38:31,688 --> 00:38:32,931
Joe invited him.

805
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:33,863
Eric St. John.

806
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,036
Trent Thomas.

807
00:38:35,071 --> 00:38:36,452
Nice to meet you.

808
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:37,453
Merry Christmas.

809
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:38,523
Thanks, man.

810
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:39,776
All that merry, merry
stuff, that's tomorrow.

811
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,734
Today, ah, we play football.

812
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,632
Yeah.

813
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:52,675
Yeah.

814
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:54,953
Yes.

815
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:55,987
Full pat, full pat.

816
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,337
Let's get this party started.

817
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,683
It's nice to see Eric again,

818
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,305
isn't it?

819
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,653
As captain of the reindeer team,
I pick first and I pick Joe.

820
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:11,832
Come on.

821
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:19,866
Polar Bears, first choice is

822
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,082
Cubby.

823
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:23,740
Wait, what?

824
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:28,020
Why did he pick him?

825
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:29,643
My money's on Eric's team.

826
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:31,714
Okay.

827
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:36,684
Okay, Reindeers.

828
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,758
Hut.

829
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,414
Touchdown.

830
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,980
Oh!

831
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:09,027
Sexy antlers on one.

832
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:09,959
And hike.

833
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:17,587
Yeah.

834
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,278
That's like hit and run.

835
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,285
Look at that.

836
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,872
Yeah!

837
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:30,358
Y'all don't want none of this.

838
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:36,261
Oh!

839
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:38,056
That's what I'm talking about.

840
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,750
Why didn't he throw to you?

841
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:43,820
Oh!

842
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:45,960
Break it down, break it down.

843
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:48,135
Yeah.

844
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,826
What are the doing?

845
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:50,758
They're losing.

846
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:51,932
I'm proud of you guys.

847
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:56,695
All right.

848
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:00,699
You're mine.

849
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:01,597
And hike.

850
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:05,704
There he is.

851
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:07,568
Yeah.

852
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:08,856
Wait, what is
going on wit the kid?

853
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,846
He's going all the way.

854
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:22,859
I'm celebrating, seriously.

855
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:29,556
Maya, why are they celebrating?

856
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,284
Let's go, hike.

857
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,012
Trent, you're bleeding.

858
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:39,807
Baby, are you okay?

859
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:40,843
Maya.

860
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:41,706
Uncle Doc, you're
bleeding, baby.

861
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:47,056
Oh, my God.

862
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,644
Just lean back and relax.

863
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,300
Open.

864
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:53,027
Ah!

865
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:55,340
What is that now?

866
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:59,344
Sodium pentanol, some
people call it truth serum.

867
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:01,967
Now, I want you to relax and I
want you to tell me what you

868
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:04,591
really think about Maya?

869
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,075
Seriously?

870
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,528
No, boy, this is Novocaine.

871
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:11,529
This is going to pinch.

872
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:15,843
All right.

873
00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:19,882
I can't believe
Joe invited Eric.

874
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:23,471
He's practically family, Maya,
and he loves Reindeer Games,

875
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:24,093
you know.

876
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,682
Just like dad.

877
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:31,583
No, Eric likes to show off and
be the center of attention and

878
00:42:31,618 --> 00:42:34,448
that is why we're not
together anymore.

879
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:37,624
I just mean he is
a strong, smart,

880
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:40,730
black man who nows who he
is and knows who you are,

881
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:44,009
a lot like your father.

882
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,874
Daddy liked the Reindeer Games
because it was time for the

883
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:49,049
family to get
together and have fun.

884
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:53,674
The terrible win at all costs
attitude that Eric had today.

885
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:55,573
Dad would have hated that.

886
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,576
You didn't always
think Eric was so bad.

887
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,650
Did you know that after England
he went to Singapore

888
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:04,249
to work as a liaison.
Mom would you stop?

889
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:09,863
I'm in love with Trent, why
can't you understand that?

890
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,765
How can you be sure, Maya?

891
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,491
Hmm?

892
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:21,875
After what, six months?

893
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:27,708
I was sure the Fourth of July.

894
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:31,332
So, you and Maya, huh?

895
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:36,199
She's uh, I mean, she's amazing.

896
00:43:36,234 --> 00:43:39,720
She's not like any other
girls I've dated before.

897
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:42,654
Not that there's anything
particularly wrong with most

898
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:49,661
other women, but I just...
I'm just saying... what was

899
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,180
I saying?

900
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,561
Maya, stay with me.

901
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:55,736
This stuff works fast.

902
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,738
Open your mouth.

903
00:43:57,773 --> 00:44:00,914
I think the world of her, sir.

904
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:02,570
So do we, so
you're in good company.

905
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:07,506
I just want you to know it's
not some... some passing fancy.

906
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:10,578
We started
spinning around to you, sir.

907
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:11,649
I'm all ears.

908
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:17,793
See, Maya's father is no
longer is no longer around,

909
00:44:17,827 --> 00:44:20,243
Her father.

910
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:23,661
I wanted to talk to you
as head of the family.

911
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:24,903
Head of the family.

912
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:30,391
Because I got a really
important question to ask you.

913
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:35,086
I really appreciate that and I
now this is hard for you to say.

914
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,501
You can say that again.

915
00:44:36,535 --> 00:44:37,640
No, you can't.

916
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,642
Yeah.

917
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,232
Um.

918
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:48,202
You know, I think relationships
are worked best when you've got

919
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:51,723
two strong people
that are together.

920
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:55,520
Like two pre-molar bicuspids.

921
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:59,524
On the other hand if one
is leaning on the other,

922
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:02,285
then you're looking
at a lateral expander.

923
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,221
If not, an
inter-proximal reduction.

924
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:09,672
And you don't want that.

925
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,778
No, I want you to
understand something.

926
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,745
Maya is one in a million.

927
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,474
And this is going to take a very
special guy to deal with her.

928
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:21,097
Like Eric?

929
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,824
No, Eric has
nothing to do with it.

930
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:24,722
What you have to concentrate on,

931
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:29,554
are you that guy?

932
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:31,383
Now, rinse.

933
00:45:31,418 --> 00:45:34,076
Am I that guy?

934
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,250
Sorry, sorry.

935
00:45:36,285 --> 00:45:40,496
Hey, look what else your
Rhodes Scholar boyfriend broke.

936
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,672
Ex-boyfriend.

937
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:46,951
Sorry.

938
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:47,985
Come on, we gotta go.

939
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:51,990
You can take your phone back.

940
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:57,444
Such a gentleman.

941
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:01,034
Oh, yeah.

942
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:02,449
You ready?

943
00:46:02,483 --> 00:46:05,797
No, wait, wait, stop
guys, wait a second.

944
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:07,765
Come on, guys.

945
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,042
No, Vashy, you can't go.

946
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:10,629
You know the rules.

947
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:12,045
Why, Maya, why not?

948
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,079
It's the rules.

949
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:18,189
Since when did you
start following the rules, huh?

950
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:20,778
Sorry, baby girl, you can't go.

951
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:21,779
Bye.

952
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,056
Maya.

953
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,643
Love you.

954
00:46:24,678 --> 00:46:26,059
We out.

955
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:42,903
You could have come to Boston.

956
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:44,077
Look, don't sweat it.

957
00:46:44,111 --> 00:46:46,907
I doubt any of my
girls are here, either.

958
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,022
I have tons of
friends at this school.

959
00:46:48,046 --> 00:46:49,979
Literally tons.

960
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:51,739
Okay, just word of advice.

961
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:55,916
Skip the whole I-T, IT speech.

962
00:46:55,951 --> 00:46:57,538
It'll be cool.

963
00:46:57,573 --> 00:47:01,991
Just seniors and grads kicking
it old school at the old school.

964
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:06,824
Cool, did you ever
come out here with Eric?

965
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,929
He doesn't compare to you.

966
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,551
And I'll show you why.

967
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:12,553
When is my birthday?

968
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,797
June 16th, 6:02, p.m.

969
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,732
Mmm, Edward forgot it twice.

970
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:19,906
Eric.

971
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,114
Ooh, see.

972
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:22,770
I've already forgotten him.

973
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,945
Maya, come here, girl.

974
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,637
Hi, how you doing?

975
00:47:27,672 --> 00:47:28,673
Good to see you.

976
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,241
You said you
wanted to see her life.

977
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:49,867
You know, I've been trying to
imagine your life down here for

978
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,766
so long, and now

979
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,802
Better or worse?

980
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:56,735
Awesome.

981
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:01,085
I'm just another member of
the Maya Greyson fan club.

982
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,741
There's no such thing.

983
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:04,743
Hey, guys, come with me.

984
00:48:04,778 --> 00:48:10,473
I want to show you something.

985
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:11,889
My God.

986
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:18,757
Yes, yes, this is
where it all started.

987
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:22,175
Welcome to the birth of DJ OBG.

988
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,523
You're looking at the
winner of the tenth grade

989
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:26,489
talent competition.

990
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:29,078
I still think that
Olar should have won.

991
00:48:29,113 --> 00:48:30,700
I bet you would, R2D2.

992
00:48:30,735 --> 00:48:32,092
Y'all sit tight, I'm going to
shed a little light on this

993
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:33,772
situation right here.

994
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:36,499
Cool, Joe.

995
00:48:36,534 --> 00:48:38,191
I mean, OBG.

996
00:48:38,225 --> 00:48:39,640
Yeah, that, right there.

997
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:43,921
Ask not what your high
school can do for you.

998
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,785
So, Lyss, how's college?

999
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,442
It's cool, just all girls.

1000
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm trying to
transfer to Georgia,

1001
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:51,721
but that's top secret, y'all.

1002
00:48:53,551 --> 00:48:56,830
Yeah, y'all
feeling that, ain't ya?

1003
00:48:56,864 --> 00:49:00,765
Yes, sir.

1004
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:02,422
This is pretty good.

1005
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:03,917
It's a bold move
with that name though.

1006
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,907
OBG?

1007
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,290
Like OBGYN.

1008
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:13,881
The doctor for pregnant ladies.

1009
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,194
That's good.

1010
00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:18,645
Thank you very
much, y'all like that one.

1011
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:21,510
Ooh, but wait until
you hear my second jam.

1012
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:24,823
DJ OBGYN.

1013
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:27,792
You're a lady doctor.

1014
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:30,968
Trent says, OBG
sounds like OBGYN,

1015
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:35,179
a physician specializing in the
health and welfare of vajay jay's,

1016
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:36,732
women's vajay jay's.

1017
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:39,528
No, OBG stands for
Original Black Genius.

1018
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:43,601
An obstetrician gynecologist,
that's what it stands for.

1019
00:49:43,635 --> 00:49:48,399
DJ OBGYN.

1020
00:49:48,433 --> 00:49:51,022
You did say this
place gave birth to you.

1021
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,059
Throw your legs in the air.

1022
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:55,923
And put your feet
in the stirrups.

1023
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:59,065
Tough Room.

1024
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,790
Hey, look on the
bright side, huh?

1025
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:04,415
At least women are
going to have to see you.

1026
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:06,313
Hey, I have no
problem seeing girls, okay?

1027
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:07,388
I'm messing with you, man.

1028
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:09,592
What do you even
know about me, man?

1029
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:12,285
Or about any of us?

1030
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,495
Joe?

1031
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:18,360
How many black
people do you know, Trent?

1032
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:21,984
I have some friends, but
I don't see people that way.

1033
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:22,847
Okay, so you don't see us.

1034
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:24,228
Joe, that is enough.

1035
00:50:24,262 --> 00:50:26,954
No, name them, Trent.

1036
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:29,371
Okay, this is getting weird.
Let's just

1037
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,683
Joe, my best friend is black.

1038
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:33,927
I didn't see that one coming.

1039
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:35,584
My best friend is black.

1040
00:50:35,618 --> 00:50:36,723
Typical.

1041
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,000
Let's go.

1042
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,175
Come on, who is
this best friend, Trent?

1043
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,595
Maya.

1044
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:47,872
Oh, snap.

1045
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:50,771
Mic drop.

1046
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,635
You're lucky.

1047
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,982
Okay.

1048
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:57,261
All right, let's dance.

1049
00:50:57,295 --> 00:50:58,538
Right.

1050
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:03,405
Oh, it's going to hurt tomorrow.

1051
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:06,028
I'm just a little bit surprised
the way you've been treating

1052
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,135
Maya and Trent.

1053
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:14,105
When Eli died, I had to
take that accounting job.

1054
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,900
What, you need money?

1055
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:22,217
No, all my work at the center,
all my volunteering downtown.

1056
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:27,084
I had to give that
up, for the kids.

1057
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:28,913
No, I don't regret it.

1058
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:34,608
I miss it, you know.

1059
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:39,061
And I feel like...
Like I lost twice.

1060
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,789
First with Eli and then again
with the people on the causes

1061
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:43,790
I really cared about.

1062
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:47,759
I feel like I sold out.

1063
00:51:47,794 --> 00:51:49,865
What are you talking about?

1064
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,626
You've raised wonderful kids.

1065
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:55,664
What's the point of all
that sacrifice if Maya

1066
00:51:55,698 --> 00:51:58,045
sells out, too?

1067
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,840
Because she fell in
love with a white guy?

1068
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,187
Do you even know
how that sounds?

1069
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,189
It's not because he's white.

1070
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:04,707
Race has nothing
to do with it, Doc.

1071
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:09,471
It would go against everything
I believe and everything

1072
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,505
I've worked for.

1073
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:20,240
I... I'm just a mom who
wants her daughter to have...

1074
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,621
To have what you had.

1075
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:22,655
More.

1076
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:30,733
Let me ask you something.

1077
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:33,564
How do you think Eli
would feel about Trent?

1078
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:35,290
Do you think I'm
doing this to spite Eli?

1079
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:39,086
I'm doing it because of Eli.

1080
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:40,950
He didn't leave us
with a trust fund,

1081
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:42,849
your brother.

1082
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:47,957
He died and he left me alone.

1083
00:52:47,992 --> 00:52:49,959
You're not alone.

1084
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:51,996
You've got me.

1085
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,275
You've got Dee.

1086
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,898
You'll never be alone.

1087
00:52:57,933 --> 00:53:00,246
You've got each other.

1088
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,938
And you're our family, too.

1089
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,805
Don't do this, baby.

1090
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,806
We're family.

1091
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,325
I know.

1092
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,809
I got you no
matter where you go.

1093
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:14,743
I know, I know.

1094
00:53:31,656 --> 00:53:35,591
OBG.

1095
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,318
He's hopeless.

1096
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:41,735
You know, I think I
like him more than Eric.

1097
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:48,949
Yeah, he's pretty all right.

1098
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:50,227
Oh, my God.

1099
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:51,987
I know why he's here.

1100
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,920
Certainly isn't his dancing.

1101
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:55,818
Some stereotypes are true.

1102
00:53:55,853 --> 00:53:57,648
No, stupid.

1103
00:53:57,682 --> 00:54:00,064
He is her to propose.

1104
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:10,005
Stop, I did not work
this hard for you to mess it up.

1105
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:11,662
Ready?

1106
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:16,598
Come on, come on,
five, six, seven, let's go.

1107
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,877
Yes, yes, yes.

1108
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:25,158
Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder.

1109
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:26,987
Are you happy?

1110
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,093
Happier than I've been in ages.

1111
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,791
Merry Christmas Mr. Tray.

1112
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:39,966
Thank you.

1113
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,836
Merry Christmas.

1114
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,079
Wake up, sleepy head.

1115
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:52,150
We got presents.

1116
00:54:52,185 --> 00:54:54,083
We got breakfast.

1117
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:55,947
And three more
people, oh, where is it?

1118
00:54:55,982 --> 00:54:58,295
Here it is.

1119
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:05,612
Four, Vashy,
Hattie, and your mom.

1120
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:07,821
Doc's still a maybe.

1121
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:14,794
Oh, you really are thorough,
what's this anyway?

1122
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:15,829
No, that's your present.

1123
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:17,555
One of them.

1124
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,798
One of them?

1125
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:19,764
Wow!

1126
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:21,973
Score.

1127
00:55:22,008 --> 00:55:26,495
Hey, uh, I was thinking.

1128
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,602
If you wanted to
take a job down here,

1129
00:55:29,636 --> 00:55:30,982
be closer to family.

1130
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:33,709
I love Boston.

1131
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:34,986
You freaking chowderhead,

1132
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:37,748
you Downey from Dorchester.

1133
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:41,855
Wicked.

1134
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,063
What?

1135
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:44,893
You don't want me in Boston?

1136
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:47,413
I want you to be happy.

1137
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,380
And if that means
we're moving down here,

1138
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:54,937
or D.C., Nairobi, or
Mars, I'm all in.

1139
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,220
And what, you think I
can't do a southern accent?

1140
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:05,638
Merry Christmas, y'all.

1141
00:56:05,672 --> 00:56:10,643
Let's go down to the river.

1142
00:56:10,677 --> 00:56:14,716
Never ever do that accent again.

1143
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,027
God, that was awful.

1144
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,995
No problem, miss.

1145
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:21,585
Come on, it's Christmas.

1146
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:22,862
Come over.

1147
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:24,208
It's Christmas.

1148
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:27,038
No presents for you
if you do not come.

1149
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:27,694
Thank you sir Oh, Santa.

1150
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:29,420
Santa Baby.

1151
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:32,699
Whoo.

1152
00:56:32,734 --> 00:56:34,114
Ho, ho, ho.

1153
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:35,115
Hey, handsome Santa.

1154
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:36,945
Santa finally arrived.

1155
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:40,811
Merry Christmas, Vashy.

1156
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,675
Vashy, be nice.

1157
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:44,401
Hey, what do you got
in the bag, Trent?

1158
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,275
I know I can't compete
with your southern hospitality,

1159
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:49,785
but I got you all
a few presents.

1160
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,131
Wow.

1161
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:56,723
My, my, my, Santa
really is here.

1162
00:56:56,758 --> 00:56:59,968
Thank you, darling.

1163
00:57:00,002 --> 00:57:01,694
Mr. Matthew.

1164
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:04,731
Bringing them over.

1165
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:05,974
Yeah.

1166
00:57:06,008 --> 00:57:11,220
Vasshy.

1167
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,601
I know you think it's Harvard,

1168
00:57:12,636 --> 00:57:13,740
but it's an HBC share.

1169
00:57:13,775 --> 00:57:15,604
I've got crabs.

1170
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,088
Nice.

1171
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:18,469
Gran Hattie.

1172
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:24,061
Oh, momma.

1173
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:26,063
She needs that.

1174
00:57:26,097 --> 00:57:27,454
That got me
through all of college.

1175
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:28,065
Thanks.

1176
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,653
Thank you.

1177
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:31,689
USS Constitution.

1178
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:34,727
What?

1179
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:36,073
What do I have?

1180
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:37,523
What is this?

1181
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:44,875
Oh, a leg massager,
oh, you'll like that, Granny.

1182
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:52,572
And last but not
least, for Renee.

1183
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:53,953
Thank you.

1184
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:55,161
Don't I get a present.

1185
00:57:55,195 --> 00:57:56,576
You're later, if you're good.

1186
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:58,129
Okay.

1187
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:07,449
That is a first
edition, excellent condition.

1188
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,978
I read the whole thing, but
carefully not to bend the spine

1189
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:10,694
or nothing.

1190
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:11,809
I mean, it was way over my head.

1191
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,110
I can't play chopsticks.

1192
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:14,836
I sing like a dying animal.

1193
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,839
But...

1194
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:18,988
This is very kind of you, Trent.

1195
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:20,531
I hope everybody
likes their present.

1196
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:24,535
Thank you, thank you.

1197
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,882
Well done, son.

1198
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,851
Speaking of Santa Claus, last
night when I was home alone,

1199
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:36,823
I stumbled across this.

1200
00:58:36,858 --> 00:58:39,930
Now, wait a minute, girl,
the parade's about to come on.

1201
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:40,758
It'll only take a minute.

1202
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:42,449
No, no.

1203
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:44,797
Look at momma.

1204
00:58:44,831 --> 00:58:46,212
Merry Christmas, you two.

1205
00:58:46,246 --> 00:58:52,425
Letters to Santa
staring Maya Greyson.

1206
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:54,910
Wait, that's me.

1207
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:59,743
Dear Santa, I want a football
helmet and a water gun and

1208
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:03,056
a hippopotamus.

1209
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:04,679
Signed Benjamin.

1210
00:59:04,713 --> 00:59:08,648
Benji, I'm down with
the helmet and water gun,

1211
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:12,825
but hippos are on the
endangered species list.

1212
00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:15,310
And they're also quite mean.

1213
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,794
They're also really mean.

1214
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:23,974
Maybe we could hear
what the other kids want?

1215
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:26,977
What a good idea.

1216
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:29,773
What about you, little boy?

1217
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,706
Who is she calling little?

1218
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:38,920
I want one of them iPods.

1219
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:44,339
You've been pretty good, but
only good enough to get an

1220
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,582
iPod Mini.

1221
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:46,616
Wait, what?

1222
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:51,515
One last thing from Santa,
until white folks see they got

1223
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:55,419
what they got because of
the hard work of black folks,

1224
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:57,594
I'm putting all white
people on the naughty list.

1225
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,216
Merry Christmas, y'all.

1226
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,666
- Merry Christmas.
- Good job, Maya.

1227
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:07,500
Oh, my.

1228
01:00:07,534 --> 01:00:13,644
Wow, I thought that the
performances were top notch.

1229
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:15,888
Excuse me, guys.

1230
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:18,615
Merry Christmas.

1231
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:23,896
Vashy, really?

1232
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:35,987
Turns out I was on the
naughty list the whole time.

1233
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:36,943
It's good to know.

1234
01:00:36,978 --> 01:00:37,978
I was ten.

1235
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:44,882
I know, but I just liked it
better when I didn't know about

1236
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:46,919
this stuff.

1237
01:00:46,953 --> 01:00:48,921
I felt like I was color blind.

1238
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:53,684
I felt like it didn't matter.

1239
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:55,721
I like being color blind.

1240
01:00:55,755 --> 01:01:03,755
Even color blind people,
Trent, can see black and white.

1241
01:01:04,108 --> 01:01:05,869
The day when I
met in the library,

1242
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:08,734
when I was upset.

1243
01:01:08,768 --> 01:01:11,081
Product liability.

1244
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:14,947
I wasn't crying
because of my exam.

1245
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:19,365
I was crying because another
student saw me reading in a

1246
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:22,230
lounge chair and
called the cops.

1247
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:23,956
What?

1248
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,430
Why would you not
tell me that, Maya?

1249
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,064
Those kinds of things
happen all the time.

1250
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:34,552
If you are color blind,
you're blind to my color.

1251
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:37,624
Which means you are
blind to my experiences.

1252
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:42,629
Which means you're blind to me.

1253
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:44,286
That is crazy, Maya.

1254
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:45,805
Human beings, we're
exactly the same.

1255
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,289
Biologically we are the same.

1256
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:50,845
Race is an illusion, okay.

1257
01:01:50,879 --> 01:01:52,709
Somebody just invented it.

1258
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:54,903
Well, somebody invented it
and now we're stuck with it.

1259
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:08,310
So...

1260
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:10,623
And what are you
doing with me, Maya?

1261
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:14,420
I'm not a civil rights activist.

1262
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:16,432
The only protest I've ever been
to is when they threatened to

1263
01:02:16,456 --> 01:02:23,360
kick my frat off of campus for
having a wrestling match against

1264
01:02:23,394 --> 01:02:27,605
a sorority in chocolate pudding.

1265
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:35,786
Maya, you are...
You are next level,

1266
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,167
okay.

1267
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:40,204
You are straight to the top.

1268
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,069
And I'm just a college
dropout who sells candy bars.

1269
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:45,071
Do not do that.

1270
01:02:45,106 --> 01:02:48,626
Do you not see what
you do to people?

1271
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:51,457
The joy you bring?

1272
01:02:51,491 --> 01:02:54,667
Ten more of you, there would be
peace in the Middle East

1273
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:57,739
by New Years.

1274
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,812
But the lawyer who was going
to go off and save the world?

1275
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,814
The girl who made that movie.

1276
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:05,851
Am I not holding her back?

1277
01:03:05,885 --> 01:03:07,507
Can't she have both?

1278
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,515
Maybe you would be
better off with someone else.

1279
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:17,827
It's your parents.

1280
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:22,281
I better take this.

1281
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:25,215
Hey, mom, Merry Christmas.

1282
01:03:25,249 --> 01:03:28,494
No, I'm not avoiding you,
I just... my phone broke.

1283
01:03:28,528 --> 01:03:34,776
It was a haphazard
game of touch football.

1284
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,811
If it happens.

1285
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:42,404
Hey, Gran, how's the parade?

1286
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:47,202
You know, same old, same old.

1287
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:53,346
Is it getting better
out there, in general?

1288
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:57,764
Times change, people don't.

1289
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:04,288
I am 78 years old but on
the inside I feel your age.

1290
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:06,118
You're as old as you feel.

1291
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:09,017
Girl, you're
missing the whole point.

1292
01:04:09,052 --> 01:04:13,263
All I'm saying is it
goes by so quickly.

1293
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:18,026
You better grab your
happiness while you can.

1294
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,305
Does he make you happy, baby?

1295
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,963
More than anybody
else, but I don't know.

1296
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:26,138
But, but, but nothing.

1297
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:27,770
You better jump because
tomorrow you'll turn

1298
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:29,762
around and you'll be me.

1299
01:04:29,796 --> 01:04:33,524
Girl, it's my nap time.

1300
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:36,113
Oh, uh, trying to
help your old Gran.

1301
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,330
You remember what I said, baby.

1302
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:55,822
I don't know.

1303
01:04:55,857 --> 01:04:56,962
The timing feels off.

1304
01:04:56,996 --> 01:04:58,687
Something like that.

1305
01:05:01,069 --> 01:05:02,277
You know when you know.

1306
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:07,869
What the hell does that mean?

1307
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,147
We need to talk.

1308
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:12,425
We sure do, baby.

1309
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,429
You raised me to be
an astute, loving,

1310
01:05:16,464 --> 01:05:19,916
brave, black woman,
and that's who I am.

1311
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,711
But I'm not you.

1312
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:27,061
Maybe I want to change the
world by being a lawyer at a big

1313
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:29,166
Boston firm.

1314
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:32,066
That's what I want to do.

1315
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,689
Why Trent?

1316
01:05:34,723 --> 01:05:36,080
I don't know who has
the bigger blinders on,

1317
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,244
you, or him.

1318
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:41,696
You're disappointed.

1319
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,835
I get it.

1320
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:49,807
Maya, he compared his
Irish ancestors to slavery.

1321
01:05:49,842 --> 01:05:52,017
He doesn't see color.

1322
01:05:52,051 --> 01:05:54,019
What happens if you have kids?

1323
01:05:54,053 --> 01:05:55,237
Who's going to
give them the talk?

1324
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:57,332
You don't know him.

1325
01:05:57,367 --> 01:06:01,336
I don't know him,
but I know you.

1326
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:08,688
And I know you're not
seeing what I'm seeing.

1327
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:10,656
My eyes are wide open.

1328
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:24,946
Hey.

1329
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,122
What's wrong?

1330
01:06:28,156 --> 01:06:30,952
I should have told you.

1331
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:36,095
And I should have
seen you, all of you.

1332
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,684
You love me?

1333
01:06:38,718 --> 01:06:40,375
I do.

1334
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,619
Do you love me?

1335
01:06:46,554 --> 01:06:47,934
Is that enough?

1336
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:52,836
I sure hope so.

1337
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:54,734
I mean, what else is there?

1338
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:22,176
She's making a mistake, Eli.

1339
01:07:25,696 --> 01:07:28,561
She's making a mistake.

1340
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:09,671
Hey, Gran, it's supper time.

1341
01:08:09,706 --> 01:08:11,087
What you looking at?

1342
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,951
See that dog.

1343
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:18,784
Every year that Christmas dog
is on that lawn from November

1344
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:20,026
through January.

1345
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:21,649
Some people think it's silly.

1346
01:08:21,683 --> 01:08:22,891
Not me.

1347
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:25,963
I can't get enough of it.

1348
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:28,725
All holidays, really.

1349
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,071
Isn't that why we like them?

1350
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:35,559
It's like old
friends coming home.

1351
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,078
I see it now.

1352
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,976
What's that?

1353
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:43,119
Why Maya likes you so much.

1354
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:46,605
You're the real
deal, Trent Thomas.

1355
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:49,125
Thank you, Hattie.

1356
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,680
You have no idea how
much I needed to hear that.

1357
01:08:52,714 --> 01:08:54,475
Let's go get some turkey.

1358
01:08:56,718 --> 01:08:58,720
Oh, thank you, baby.

1359
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:16,980
You can't have
none of this wine.

1360
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:18,671
You know you can't
have none of this wine.

1361
01:09:18,706 --> 01:09:19,914
Merry Christmas, Trent.

1362
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,018
Are you good?

1363
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:23,262
Good, sir, yeah.

1364
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:24,988
At least I think I am.

1365
01:09:25,022 --> 01:09:29,510
I was thinking about what you
were telling me about being

1366
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:30,787
that guy.

1367
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:36,586
And yeah, I'm sure.

1368
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,555
Oh, good.

1369
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,282
Why, like 80, 80% sure.

1370
01:09:43,317 --> 01:09:46,112
What about the other 20%, son?

1371
01:09:46,147 --> 01:09:49,771
I'm thinking she's
way out of my league.

1372
01:09:49,806 --> 01:09:54,397
Yeah, well, son, that's the
way every man should feel.

1373
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:54,914
Careful.

1374
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:56,744
I do, I really do.

1375
01:09:56,778 --> 01:09:59,712
Shall we begin, everyone?

1376
01:09:59,747 --> 01:10:04,027
Let's bow our heads.

1377
01:10:04,061 --> 01:10:07,893
Oh, Heavenly Father, we thank
you for this magnificent feast

1378
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:10,861
and for all the blessings that
you've bestowed on this family.

1379
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,589
And we also thank you for the
fellowship of good friends.

1380
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:17,385
And Father, we'd like to say a
special prayer in remembrance of

1381
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,975
those who are no longer
with us, as we reflect on your

1382
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:24,599
benevolence of
this holiday season.

1383
01:10:24,634 --> 01:10:27,533
Amen.

1384
01:10:27,568 --> 01:10:29,466
I'm excited.

1385
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,088
I don't know why
I don't have wine.

1386
01:10:33,988 --> 01:10:36,266
I mean, all of the grownups...

1387
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:38,095
We'll get you
something later, all right.

1388
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,097
I still think I
can have me a little wine.

1389
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:42,238
Your mother really
outdid herself this year.

1390
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,135
Did she really cook the
turkey or did she order it?

1391
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,550
She cooked it.

1392
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,069
We helped her.

1393
01:10:56,493 --> 01:10:59,358
Uh-oh now we
bout to get into it.

1394
01:10:59,393 --> 01:11:06,745
No, I just have an
announcement to make.

1395
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:10,921
It's more like a
question really.

1396
01:11:10,956 --> 01:11:14,580
But first, I want to express
my thanks for you all having me

1397
01:11:14,615 --> 01:11:17,480
into your home, or
should I say homes.

1398
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,244
You guys are wicked cool.

1399
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,387
And when I first met
Maya, I'm thinking,

1400
01:11:28,422 --> 01:11:29,975
no sir.

1401
01:11:30,009 --> 01:11:32,357
Like me, no.

1402
01:11:33,806 --> 01:11:37,500
And... and then coming down
here and seeing all of you,

1403
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:42,401
I feel like this would
be the perfect place,

1404
01:11:42,436 --> 01:11:46,060
the perfect time to... I'm
just rambling on like this.

1405
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,855
I'm usually more
prepared than this.

1406
01:11:47,889 --> 01:11:49,684
I'm a salesman.

1407
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:52,894
Maybe this will help.

1408
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:53,654
What is that?

1409
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,034
What's this?

1410
01:11:55,069 --> 01:11:56,277
Is that my notebook?

1411
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,693
Yo, yo, who are
you calling a narcissist?

1412
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:00,868
I take selfies a lot?

1413
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:01,903
Mom?

1414
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:02,559
Whoa.

1415
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:05,700
Mom?

1416
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:06,667
What are you doing?

1417
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:08,565
I'm a little ditzy.

1418
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,396
I tend to think
whatever Doc tells me to.

1419
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,537
I don't do that, do I, honey?

1420
01:12:14,571 --> 01:12:17,091
Let me see that book.

1421
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,195
You don't understand.

1422
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:21,026
You... this is not
what it looks like.

1423
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:25,962
Since when did you
start betting on sports?

1424
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:27,101
What's going on here, son?

1425
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,311
Oh, my God, what?

1426
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,348
So, you are
transferring out of Wardwell.

1427
01:12:32,382 --> 01:12:34,049
No, daddy, I was
thinking it's a possibility.

1428
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:35,040
What's this?

1429
01:12:35,074 --> 01:12:36,938
It's nothing.

1430
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:37,984
Since when are you a Buddhist?

1431
01:12:38,008 --> 01:12:38,975
What?

1432
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:39,907
What?

1433
01:12:39,941 --> 01:12:44,118
Uh, Matthew, I am...

1434
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:50,331
Conservative,
paternalistic, stuffy.

1435
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,196
Just what kind of game
are you playing here, boy?

1436
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,129
Just this is not what it seems.

1437
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,199
Renee, this was private.

1438
01:12:56,233 --> 01:12:59,271
Why did you give that to them?

1439
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:01,204
I didn't write the words.

1440
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:04,207
You... this is
not what it looks like.

1441
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:15,874
I'm gonna...

1442
01:13:27,955 --> 01:13:29,577
How could you?

1443
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,726
Trent, Trent, Trent.

1444
01:13:40,761 --> 01:13:42,107
Maya.

1445
01:13:43,349 --> 01:13:44,389
I need you to listen to me.

1446
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,521
I didn't want it to go
down like this.

1447
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,941
I don't believe you.

1448
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:51,461
You need someone like you.

1449
01:13:51,496 --> 01:13:53,463
A champion, a fighter
for the right causes.

1450
01:13:53,498 --> 01:13:55,258
You never even
gave him a chance.

1451
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:56,612
Trust me, as much
as it hurts now,

1452
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,606
it's much better than.

1453
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:00,505
You know what Trent believes in?

1454
01:14:00,539 --> 01:14:01,609
Me.

1455
01:14:01,644 --> 01:14:06,096
The way daddy did and
the way you used to.

1456
01:14:06,131 --> 01:14:08,167
Why do you think
I'm so upset, Maya?

1457
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:11,447
Because I believe in you.

1458
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:14,311
Talk about blind.

1459
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:17,383
Have you forgotten what he
was like when he was alive?

1460
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:20,939
The same energy,
the same love, kindness.

1461
01:14:20,973 --> 01:14:21,940
What are you talking about?

1462
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:26,013
Trent, mom.

1463
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:29,188
I'm not the one who
changed, you are.

1464
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:30,511
You are saying you want
me to think for myself,

1465
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:34,470
but as soon as I do,
somehow I'm wrong.

1466
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:36,126
Somehow I've failed.

1467
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:40,510
I know you gave up
your dream and it sucks.

1468
01:14:40,545 --> 01:14:42,754
I'm sorry.

1469
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:49,139
But it's like you're blaming me
for how your life turned out.

1470
01:14:49,174 --> 01:14:56,008
This... this is you failing.

1471
01:14:56,043 --> 01:15:01,393
Trent, wait.

1472
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:03,878
Trent, wait.

1473
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:05,328
Trent.

1474
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:07,917
Just come back inside.

1475
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:08,780
Everything's okay.

1476
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:10,126
I'm sorry.

1477
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,576
I guess I was just
soft in the head.

1478
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:13,070
I thought I could come down here
and be a part of your family.

1479
01:15:13,094 --> 01:15:15,200
Baby, let's just go inside.

1480
01:15:15,234 --> 01:15:16,822
It's gonna be fine.

1481
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:18,548
She hate me, Maya.

1482
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:19,307
They all hate me.

1483
01:15:19,342 --> 01:15:20,964
Trent, just come back inside.

1484
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,552
It's okay, baby.

1485
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:26,418
I love you, Maya.

1486
01:15:26,452 --> 01:15:27,799
I'm sorry.

1487
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:29,663
What?

1488
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:31,285
Trent.

1489
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:00,935
Maya.

1490
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,765
Merry Christmas, mom.

1491
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:18,333
So, if you
didn't say it, then who did.

1492
01:17:18,357 --> 01:17:19,677
Oh, my God, would
you two drop it?

1493
01:17:20,877 --> 01:17:22,614
See, the fact that you can't
just proves you're a narcissist.

1494
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,638
See, I knew it.

1495
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,022
May I suggest we just all calm
down, take a beat and meditate?

1496
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:29,196
Oh, who cares what you think,

1497
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,576
you skinny, black Buddha.

1498
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:31,957
Spoken like a true narcissist.

1499
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:32,509
Hey, don't talk
to my sister like that.

1500
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:33,372
Or what?

1501
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:34,926
You're gonna give
me a mammogram?

1502
01:17:39,896 --> 01:17:41,139
What the hell is this?

1503
01:17:41,173 --> 01:17:44,038
Let me guess, a
membership renewal to the NRA?

1504
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:45,873
Oh, an invitation to a
George Bush fundraiser?

1505
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:49,250
Or a receipt to a box of Oreos?

1506
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:51,321
That is my
farewell correspondence.

1507
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:53,876
I'm moving out, if there is
one thing I cannot tolerate

1508
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:55,947
it's intolerance.

1509
01:17:55,981 --> 01:17:57,638
What?

1510
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,605
What?

1511
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,031
My forwarding
address is at the bottom.

1512
01:18:01,055 --> 01:18:04,610
Boy, your forwarding address
is the address of this house.

1513
01:18:04,645 --> 01:18:06,302
That is correct.

1514
01:18:06,336 --> 01:18:10,064
Here I feel accepted, even in
the company of vengeful mothers,

1515
01:18:10,099 --> 01:18:13,171
teenage narcissists and
musical gynecologists.

1516
01:18:21,317 --> 01:18:26,529
Two days ago we were fine, a
normal, messed up family.

1517
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:27,806
What happened?

1518
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:29,083
Trent happened.

1519
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:30,498
And his stupid notebook.

1520
01:18:30,533 --> 01:18:34,399
Why do you think he wrote
those notes in the first place?

1521
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:37,367
Do you think it was all a part
of his evil plan to spring it on

1522
01:18:37,402 --> 01:18:40,094
you and ruin your holidays?

1523
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:43,477
To destroy what
he has with Maya?

1524
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:47,723
So, you picked a
stupid nickname, so what?

1525
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:51,865
And you, somebody said
you were self involved.

1526
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:56,317
Well, show me a teenage
girl on this planet who isn't?

1527
01:18:56,352 --> 01:19:00,356
And honey, your problem ain't
that you want to go to another

1528
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:03,946
college, your problem is you
can't discuss it with your

1529
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,534
mother and father.

1530
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:08,364
Son, you're stuffy.

1531
01:19:08,398 --> 01:19:10,090
Mom.

1532
01:19:10,124 --> 01:19:10,918
And baby, I'm sorry,
but you are ditzy,

1533
01:19:10,953 --> 01:19:13,024
but I love you.

1534
01:19:13,058 --> 01:19:15,751
And you, you, boy,
you're going to hell,

1535
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:17,856
but that's your choice.

1536
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:22,481
Don't you see, he wrote those
notes because he wanted

1537
01:19:22,516 --> 01:19:24,138
to know us.

1538
01:19:24,173 --> 01:19:27,072
He wanted to get
y'all's blessings.

1539
01:19:27,107 --> 01:19:29,385
But did you help?

1540
01:19:29,419 --> 01:19:31,352
Or at least tend to
your own methods?

1541
01:19:31,387 --> 01:19:38,808
No, y'all figured you'd
just pop his balloon.

1542
01:19:38,843 --> 01:19:41,052
Oh, well, pop.

1543
01:19:41,086 --> 01:19:43,502
He's gone.

1544
01:19:43,537 --> 01:19:45,435
Happy now?

1545
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,757
Oh, look.

1546
01:20:31,792 --> 01:20:32,828
Go on.

1547
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:33,943
Go on back to your squabbling.

1548
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:39,041
I'm through with all of y'all.

1549
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:42,423
You're not moving.

1550
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,080
I can't do it.

1551
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:46,427
Sorry for calling
you a narcissist, Vash.

1552
01:20:46,462 --> 01:20:49,016
That's cool.

1553
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:55,367
Matt, Lyss, I believe I
owe you two an apology.

1554
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,749
I believe we can
talk about this.

1555
01:20:57,783 --> 01:20:59,095
We're better than this.

1556
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,925
You want to blame somebody.

1557
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:04,066
Blame me.

1558
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,378
I told him most of
those things about you.

1559
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:09,795
I wanted him to love
you for who you are,

1560
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:11,625
the way I do.

1561
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:16,699
And we love you, honey.

1562
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:19,805
I used to think that
mattered more than him,

1563
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,154
more than us.

1564
01:21:23,188 --> 01:21:27,572
But now if I have to choose.

1565
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,169
I ain't never
said he was perfect.

1566
01:21:38,203 --> 01:21:41,068
Yes, sometimes he sticks
his foot in his mouth,

1567
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:43,829
but I have never met
anybody who cares more,

1568
01:21:43,864 --> 01:21:47,109
or who tries harder.

1569
01:21:47,143 --> 01:21:51,044
Daddy used to say we are
the most forgiving people,

1570
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:52,183
because we have to be.

1571
01:21:52,217 --> 01:21:54,116
Well I want to be, too.

1572
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:59,190
So, I'm going to keep trying.

1573
01:21:59,224 --> 01:22:06,059
Because bottom line, I love him.

1574
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,233
What else is there?

1575
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:19,210
There are 100 reasons
why I did what I did.

1576
01:22:19,244 --> 01:22:24,387
And every one of them was wrong.

1577
01:22:24,422 --> 01:22:27,804
This was never
about Trent, honey.

1578
01:22:27,839 --> 01:22:30,014
This is all about you.

1579
01:22:30,048 --> 01:22:32,948
Or maybe it was about me.

1580
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,157
I don't know.

1581
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:39,920
Maybe some day
you'll forgive me.

1582
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:44,890
I know your dad would.

1583
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:49,343
But I am truly, truly sorry.

1584
01:22:52,036 --> 01:22:53,727
I'm so sorry.

1585
01:23:02,322 --> 01:23:04,324
We gonna save you, ain't we?

1586
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:12,159
Let's find him, okay.

1587
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:15,128
His phone is broken and I
have no clue where he is.

1588
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,002
Maybe we can put our heads
together and come up

1589
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:19,580
with something.

1590
01:23:19,615 --> 01:23:20,685
Black Shout Out.

1591
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:21,617
Will that work?

1592
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:22,756
Vashy, you're a genius.

1593
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,102
What's that?

1594
01:23:24,137 --> 01:23:26,035
A new rapper.

No, mother, just no.

1607
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:55,651
Yo I thought that was on fleek.

1608
01:23:55,685 --> 01:23:57,756
On fleek, now I
know he's a rapper.

1609
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:25,888
Is it him?

1610
01:24:25,922 --> 01:24:27,717
Maya, honey.

1611
01:24:27,752 --> 01:24:28,752
We got him.

1612
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:36,036
Come on, kids.

1613
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,934
Dee, Dee, you follow me?

1614
01:24:37,969 --> 01:24:39,522
Come on, baby.

1615
01:24:39,557 --> 01:24:41,041
This way.

1616
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:42,594
I love you.

1617
01:24:56,919 --> 01:24:57,782
Is this the fastest way there.

1618
01:24:57,816 --> 01:24:58,886
The bridge, honey.

1619
01:24:58,921 --> 01:25:03,201
It's Christmas Day.

1620
01:25:03,236 --> 01:25:05,617
I'm just going to pull up,
you jump out of the car.

1621
01:25:05,652 --> 01:25:06,929
What if we miss him?

1622
01:25:06,963 --> 01:25:09,414
Stop, stop, stop.

1623
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:10,070
Thanks.

1624
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:10,898
Go, go, go.

1625
01:25:10,933 --> 01:25:11,865
Go get him.

1626
01:25:20,494 --> 01:25:21,564
Hi.

1627
01:25:21,599 --> 01:25:23,566
Hey.

1628
01:25:23,601 --> 01:25:25,430
You missed something.

1629
01:25:29,538 --> 01:25:32,472
Yeah, I missed a lot
of things, didn't I?

1630
01:25:32,506 --> 01:25:35,613
So much for
seeing things better.

1631
01:25:35,647 --> 01:25:39,030
What do you see now?

1632
01:25:39,064 --> 01:25:43,103
I see the most
beautiful woman in the world.

1633
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,624
And I see that she's black.

1634
01:25:46,658 --> 01:25:48,039
And?

1635
01:25:48,073 --> 01:25:55,633
And I see that I'm
a big chowderhead.

1636
01:25:55,667 --> 01:25:58,946
Anything else?

1637
01:25:58,981 --> 01:26:03,019
Got a long way to go.

1638
01:26:03,054 --> 01:26:05,539
What do you see?

1639
01:26:05,574 --> 01:26:07,886
I see my family.

1640
01:26:07,921 --> 01:26:09,371
There he is.

1641
01:26:09,405 --> 01:26:10,751
Hold on.

1642
01:26:10,786 --> 01:26:11,649
We're here.

1643
01:26:11,683 --> 01:26:13,306
Really?

1644
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,686
No, really, I see my family.

1645
01:26:14,721 --> 01:26:16,516
They're coming.

1646
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:19,450
She found him.

1647
01:26:19,484 --> 01:26:22,798
Guys, guys, I just want to
explain that that was not...

1648
01:26:22,832 --> 01:26:25,214
I believe these are yours.

1649
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:29,598
I never should have taken them.

1650
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,462
What is this anyway?

1651
01:26:31,496 --> 01:26:34,603
It was supposed to be the
other half of your present.

1652
01:26:34,637 --> 01:26:35,983
Go on, Maya.

1653
01:26:43,853 --> 01:26:45,510
Why would you give me a kora.

1654
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:46,994
I wasn't going to
give it to you.

1655
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:49,238
He was going to play it.

1656
01:26:49,273 --> 01:26:53,138
I read it in your notebook.

1657
01:26:54,795 --> 01:26:55,795
No, I was.

1658
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:03,148
Maya told me that mom and dad
taught you all a Swahili song,

1659
01:27:03,183 --> 01:27:05,806
so I just wanted to prove
I wasn't just some guy.

1660
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:06,635
You know "Moja Mbili Tatu"?

1661
01:27:06,669 --> 01:27:08,430
Now that's funny.

1662
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:09,741
Yeah, right.

1663
01:27:09,776 --> 01:27:10,776
Go on.
So, play it.

1664
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:11,847
Like right now?

1665
01:27:11,881 --> 01:27:12,848
Yes.

1666
01:27:12,882 --> 01:27:14,229
Show us what you got.

1667
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:16,058
Come on.

1668
01:27:16,092 --> 01:27:18,957
Oh, uh, all right, okay.

1669
01:27:45,881 --> 01:27:47,123
My God.

1670
01:27:47,158 --> 01:27:49,022
Get on, boy.

1671
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:51,956
You can't sing and
you can't dance.

1672
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:54,648
I hate to admit
it, pretty awesome.

1673
01:27:54,683 --> 01:27:56,788
Well done, son.

1674
01:27:56,823 --> 01:27:58,445
Well done.

1675
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,517
This big romantic gestures, they
just seem spontaneous but they

1676
01:28:01,552 --> 01:28:04,831
really actually
take a long time.

1677
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:07,074
This one about four months.

1678
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:09,836
Did you forget about
your other present?

1679
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,251
You mean that?

1680
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:19,570
Okay.

1681
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:28,855
Maya Greyson, I love
you with all my heart.

1682
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:31,547
Mmm hmm.

1683
01:28:31,582 --> 01:28:36,725
Would you and your whole
crazy family please marry me?

1684
01:28:36,759 --> 01:28:44,457
Yes, yes, me and my whole crazy
family would love to marry you.

1685
01:28:50,946 --> 01:28:51,843
All right, get in.

1686
01:28:51,878 --> 01:28:54,812
Group hug, group hug.

1687
01:28:54,846 --> 01:28:58,574
Come on, let's go home, son.

1688
01:28:58,609 --> 01:29:00,749
My purse.

1689
01:29:00,783 --> 01:29:02,785
She wasn't that bad.

1690
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:04,097
You did it, you did it.

1691
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,755
She said yes, everybody!

1692
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:11,967
You're all right, man.

1693
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:14,176
Can you move in with us now?

1694
01:29:14,210 --> 01:29:17,766
