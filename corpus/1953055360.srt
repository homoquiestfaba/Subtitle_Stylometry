1
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,180
Let's go party!

2
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,235
Yeah, baby!

3
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,354
Yeah! Gilly, get out here!

4
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,449
Yeah! Yeah!

5
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,611
Let's go, baby, we got bitches waiting!

6
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,541
Go! Faster! Put the pedal to the metal!

7
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,914
- Party!
- Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,418
Yeah, Jake!

9
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,801
Yeah!

10
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,344
- Hey, ladies. We are here.
- You guys are crazy!

11
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,220
- Get ready to party.
- Yeah!

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,601
We are here!

13
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,934
Whoa!

14
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,437
Yo, Nathan.

15
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,320
Dude, you're crazy.

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,777
Yes, I am.

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,739
- You all right, man? Okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

18
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,494
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,877
- Check it out!
- Dude.

20
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,004
Gilly!

21
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,173
Yo, guys, be right back.

22
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,640
What's up, homey? Check it out, man.

23
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,137
Good quality. You like?

24
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,684
Thanks, man. This is hot.

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,013
That's right. All right, man. Peace.

26
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,193
Two hundred bucks, man.

27
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,770
Dude, that's criminal.

28
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,651
No, it's a fair price.

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,448
I make the best fake IDs in Pennsylvania.

30
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,946
You know what? You should put that
on your college application.

31
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,993
Dude! I can't believe
how mainstream you guys are.

32
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,124
You guys are so mainstream.
I gotta get you some underground...

33
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,376
Yo, heads up. Coming your way.

34
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,882
Here we go again.

35
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Uh-oh. Here she comes.

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,399
- Hey, Karen.
- Hi, Nathan.

37
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,149
Watch it.

38
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,152
Watch it? Watch what? You bumped into me.

39
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,485
Billy! Billy, I'm serious! Listen to me.
Billy! Billy!

40
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,164
Come on.

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,545
- Is he serious?
- Whoa.

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,671
- That was exciting.
- Let's go get drunk.

43
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,801
You ready? Hold it, hold it!

44
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,099
Wait! Ball! Ball! Ball!

45
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,683
Every time!

46
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,153
- All right.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait! Announcement!

47
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,697
A little gift from my dad.

48
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,657
VIP tickets to the first Pirates home game.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,573
Dude, I will drink to that.

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,121
- Let's have a good night, boys!
- Let's toast! Let's do it!

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,702
- A great night!
- Yeah!

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,421
Whoa!

53
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,396
Look at this guy. Hey, wake up.

54
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,523
Look, whoever you are,
you gotta get out of here.

55
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,768
My parents will be home in an hour.

56
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,649
All right, girls, we have to hurry up.
My parents will kill me.

57
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,077
Trish, do you have any more bags?

58
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,368
You know, you really don't have to
help me pick up all this stuff.

59
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,495
It's okay. It's the least I can do.

60
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,621
If my parents see you here,

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,543
they might get really pissed at me, though.

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,788
Yeah. Mine, too.

63
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,964
Perfect timing.

64
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,394
- All right, get those mitts on.
- Wake up.

65
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,229
Can't believe you're making me fight
hungover.

66
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,985
You wanna drink like a man?

67
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,907
Let's see if you can fight like a man.
Come on, let's go!

68
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,780
Hit me.

69
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,457
Come on! Hit me! It's not patty-cake.
Punch me! Here!

70
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,496
Move your feet!

71
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,128
I'm right here. Knock my head off. Come on!

72
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,800
Come on, Son!

73
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,960
Hands up!

74
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,215
My boys.

75
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,840
Hands up! Come on!

76
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,642
This is bullshit.

77
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,060
I'll tell you what's bullshit.

78
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,230
Bullshit's getting so drunk
that you can't defend yourself.

79
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,522
You can't watch your back.

80
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,193
That's bullshit, Son.

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,824
Come on! Turn around! Move! Let's go!

82
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,572
- Kevin!
- What?

83
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,201
Bet you're glad you went last night now.

84
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,506
Doesn't taste as good on the way out
as it did on the way in, I'll bet, huh?

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,626
See, this is what I call a party.

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,886
You wanna hurt me, Nathan?

87
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,681
Don't get mad, get even.
Don't lose control.

88
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,009
Think about it. Clear your head now. Focus.

89
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,230
Bear hug? That's all you got?

90
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,022
Come on. Your mother hits harder than that.
Show me something.

91
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,193
You're so slow!

92
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,146
Come on! Pay attention! Come on.

93
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,117
Use your head, Nathan. Think!

94
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,453
You better show me something soon, Son,
or you're gonna go down.

95
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,950
Come On!

96
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,036
I thought we were boxing.

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,998
You always said the person
that ends the fight was the winner.

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,378
Do I look like I'm done?

99
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,419
You want to play with no rules?

100
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,880
You better be careful
what you let out of the box.

101
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,845
Come on. Get up!
That wasn't that hard, Nathan.

102
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,555
What's the matter? Come on. Use your anger.

103
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,185
Think about it. Keep control.

104
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,437
Look for an opening. What are you gonna do?

105
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,768
You can't punch me. You can't kick me.

106
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,444
What are you gonna do?

107
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,446
Come on!

108
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,570
Is that all you got?
You gotta get me off balance.

109
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,153
Gonna dance all day?
You gonna show me something?

110
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,162
Good shot.

111
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,080
Now we're talking.

112
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,247
I'm bigger than you,
but you can take me, Nathan. Come on!

113
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,551
Wait till you get old.

114
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,720
Hey, guys. Guys!

115
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,474
Kevin!

116
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,975
- You got me!
- Finish me off! Take me...

117
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,225
Enough!

118
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,527
What? We're just working out.

119
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,279
You look like you're
trying to kill each other.

120
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,823
Nah! No, we're good. Right, Nate?

121
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,196
Good job, Son.

122
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,742
You...

123
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,960
God, you smell like beer.

124
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,457
Can I take a shower?

125
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,040
I just don't went to get
a phone call one night

126
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,796
that you wrapped your
motorcycle around a tree.

127
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,626
I wasn't even driving.

128
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,216
Hey, you were out all night. You didn't call.
You're grounded for a week.

129
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,469
Are you serious?

130
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,846
Yeah, I'm serious.

131
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,927
Why? Do you not trust me?

132
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,437
After last night, not so much.

133
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,976
Did you ever hear that phrase,
"Trust needs to be earned"?

134
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,150
- ... He doesn't do yoga.
- Whoa!

135
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,406
- He did yoga before.
- He did not do yoga.

136
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,280
- Tell him.
- You went to a yoga class?

137
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,662
- Mom took me.
- You're serious?

138
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,493
See? And you were in pain the next day.

139
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,953
- Admit it. Tell him.
- When did you take him to yoga?

140
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,083
You didn't ask me about taking him to yoga.

141
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,750
I have to ask you everything that I do?

142
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,503
No. If you believe in
secret lives in this house,

143
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,880
I didn't get the memo.

144
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,336
Your dad needs yoga. Tell him.

145
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,387
He has more important things
to do with his day.

146
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,010
You really do need yoga.

147
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,466
- It's good for your mind.
- What's yoga for?

148
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,802
- Your body. Your spirit.
- Tell me a practical application for yoga.

149
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,182
- You could use some.
- That'll happen

150
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,638
the day I take up basket-weaving.

151
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,849
Hey, Nathan, you're on clean-up duty.

152
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,524
Come on. Your mother cooked.
I worked all day.

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,602
- What did you do?
- That's right.

154
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,584
Are you going to spin me? Whoa!

155
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,128
You got it.

156
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,564
You've gotten better and better,
you know that?

157
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,108
You always have new problems.

158
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,606
- It's always my fault.
- What is it now?

159
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,811
It's every single time, Billy!

160
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,317
Because it's
mostly your fault, Karen!

161
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,739
- It's always my fault!
- Have you thought about that?

162
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,816
All you think about is football.

163
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,401
If you're so over this,
then just get out of here!

164
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,782
- You know what? I will get out of here.
- I don't need this.

165
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,081
You're in high school, Karen.
I could have any girl I want in college.

166
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,662
God!

167
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,250
What are you looking at, freak?

168
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,099
Sometimes I do feel like a freak.

169
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,274
I walk around like everybody else.

170
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,863
But inside I just feel different.

171
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,446
Like I'm a stranger in my own life.

172
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,581
Or I'm sitting at the breakfast table
with my parents,

173
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,832
and I'm just like,

174
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,256
"Who are these people?"

175
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,505
Don't you think
everybody feels that way growing up?

176
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,633
Do they all go to a shrink?

177
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,893
Not everyone has insomnia
and impulsivity and rage issues, Nathan.

178
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,845
I used your technique.

179
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,308
Last night, this guy snapped at me,

180
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,024
and I had this overwhelming urge
to run across the street

181
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,104
and smash his face in.

182
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,614
But you contained it.

183
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,945
Yeah. I put the anger away.

184
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,989
I chilled. It wasn't worth it.

185
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,456
That's great, Nathan.

186
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,913
Do you realize we probably would have
been having this discussion

187
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,044
in juvenile court a year ago?

188
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,217
You're making progress.

189
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,850
But I still have the dreams.

190
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,685
When was the last one?

191
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,352
Two nights ago.

192
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,857
Any new details?

193
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,235
It was mostly the same.

194
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,991
I see the woman standing there.

195
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,620
She starts singing to me.
I think it's a lullaby.

196
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,493
Then comes the attack.

197
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,256
And then it's over.

198
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,560
Nathan, some dreams are based in reality,

199
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,731
but others are
our mind's way of handling anxiety

200
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:48,310
just by pushing it
deep into your subconscious.

201
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,399
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

202
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,822
Don't most psychiatrists want to

203
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,984
unearth these things?

204
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,994
I'm not most psychiatrists.

205
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,656
Our time is up.

206
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,503
- Have a good week, Nathan.
- Thanks.

207
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,016
Go, Talbots, go!

208
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,354
- I think you won that match.
- Definitely.

209
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,306
You know what?
You guys are both dicks, okay?

210
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,438
I don't know how y'all convinced me
into joining the wrestling team.

211
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,485
- It was your idea.
- "It's fun, Gilly, it's fun. "

212
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,189
You know what? It's probably a lot of fun
when you out there kicking ass,

213
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,821
but let me tell you, it's a lot less fun
when you getting the smack down.

214
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,909
Come on, Nathan. Come on!

215
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,456
- You got this! You got him!
- Hold on! Hold on!

216
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,166
You got him! Take him down! Take him!

217
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,584
Damn!

218
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,504
Pin him down, man.
You got this! You got this!

219
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,340
Keep him pinned!

220
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,837
Game over!

221
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,511
Yeah, sure.

222
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,264
It's easy when your guy
just rolls over for you.

223
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,345
Come on, he didn't even put up a fight.

224
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,476
- Could you take him?
- Yeah, probably.

225
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:58,940
Whoa.

226
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,576
You joining the militia group or something?

227
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,990
So I go to the gun range three to
four times a week to blow off steam.

228
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,915
I'm a virgin. What else am I gonna do?

229
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,082
True.

230
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,957
- He was there, right?
- He was there, but he hasn't called me back.

231
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,716
Here we go again. You look at her.

232
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,671
She glances back at you.
You both totally dig each other.

233
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,300
And yet nobody pulls the trigger.

234
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,307
Grow a pair and make that happen, man.

235
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,385
You act like you're afraid to talk to her.

236
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,685
I'm not afraid.

237
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,065
- I don't wanna go to class.
- Me neither.

238
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,858
- Then do something.
- Fine.

239
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,860
Watch.

240
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,323
Hey.

241
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,659
Karen.

242
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,825
- Smooth.
- Yeah.

243
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,246
All I'm asking is that you do
the minimal amount of work in this class

244
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,294
to give yourself the illusion
that you're actually learning something,

245
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:58,500
and to give me a modicum of self-respect,
like I'm actually teaching a class.

246
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:03,297
It's called sociology.
The study of society.

247
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,469
People. Besides yourselves.

248
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,973
You're going to choose
one of these topics on the screen

249
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,930
to be the subject
of your 10-page research paper.

250
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,772
You should know
that your 10-page research paper

251
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,648
is going to constitute 75%
of your midterm grade.

252
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,946
Yes, yes, I know, I know, I know.
Your lives have been ruined.

253
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,280
But you know
what Mr. Miles is gonna do for you?

254
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,655
I'm going to assign you a partner,

255
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,952
so that you can learn
to share responsibilities,

256
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,533
to share the work load.

257
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,289
Ernesto, you're gonna work with Susan.

258
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,540
Nathan, meet Karen.

259
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,377
Gilly, you're gonna be working with Sean.

260
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,960
And let's see, Ladislav and Mohammed.

261
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,383
Romeo, Juliet.

262
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,033
- Hey, Mrs. Harper.
- Hey, how are you?

263
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,995
I'm not doing all the work for you
on this research paper.

264
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,663
You got that?

265
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,828
Got it.

266
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,336
You still like games.

267
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,340
When was the last time you were here?

268
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,503
You had a bunk bed.

269
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,213
Wow.

270
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,344
Hey.

271
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,051
Kids want something to eat or drink

272
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:17,560
or some more pillows to sit on the floor?

273
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,935
Mom.

274
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,309
Okay. You want the door open or closed?

275
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,269
Close it. Please.

276
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,606
Okay.

277
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:37,579
Uh, well, we should probably get to work.

278
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,249
Says here over 2,300 Americans
are reported missing every day.

279
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,006
I found a website for missing kids here.

280
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,516
They have height, weight, age,

281
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,016
favorite foods, medical reports.

282
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,767
Check it out.

283
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,103
Wow.

284
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,186
Last place they were seen.
People they were affiliated with.

285
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,566
Everything.

286
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,940
Yeah.

287
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,283
I'll send you this link.

288
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,538
What was that story I heard about you

289
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,044
waking up in your underwear
on the lawn after that party?

290
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,673
Just a practical joke.

291
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,891
- Right.
- Not worth explaining.

292
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,264
And I had pants on. Yeah.

293
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,900
I thought your boyfriend
was gonna take a swing at me that night.

294
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,151
He's not my boyfriend.

295
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,650
Hmm.

296
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,779
What'd you say to him anyway
to make him back off so quickly?

297
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,910
I told him that
you'd kick him in his big fat head

298
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,368
and embarrass him in front of everyone
if he didn't stop acting like a dick.

299
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,212
How'd you know
I would have kicked him in the head?

300
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,459
How long have we lived
across the street from each other, Nathan?

301
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,510
Hey, check this out.

302
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,969
What is it?

303
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:21,350
I found this site that shows you mock-ups
of what missing kids might look like today.

304
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,775
And if you recognize a person,
you can click on their childhood pics.

305
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,694
Check out this guy!

306
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:33,032
Jason Statham meets Justin Bieber.

307
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,326
Seriously!

308
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,195
Uh, next.

309
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:39,989
Oh.

310
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,036
Ryan Seacrest meets...

311
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,831
- Lady Gage.
- Whoa!

312
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,341
Next.

313
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,462
Matt Damon meets...

314
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,800
you.

315
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,845
That doesn't look like me.

316
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,980
Nope. You're right.
It's definitely not you.

317
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,057
This kid's too cute.

318
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,818
- Could you send me a link to that site?
- Yeah.

319
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,534
My uncle's coming to check up on me
'cause my folks are out of town.

320
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,831
When did you want to start outlining?

321
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,086
How about I come over in an hour?

322
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,881
Yeah, yeah, awesome. Bye.

323
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,434
Weird.

324
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,001
You're gonna put me off my food now.

325
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,354
Marlin and Lorna Price?

326
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,437
So the lemon and then the capers.

327
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,236
- Sauté it a bit.
- Hey, what's goin' on?

328
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,532
Hey, where do you think you're going?

329
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,238
What?

330
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,244
Come here.
Did you forget you were grounded?

331
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,456
Nathan. Your mother said get over here.
Get over here.

332
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,091
What's up? Are you going to Karen's?

333
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,385
- Yeah, it's for a school project.
- What project?

334
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,052
It's on websites.

335
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,100
- Can I go?
- And you have to get it done tonight?

336
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,769
- And it has to be finished?
- Pretty much.

337
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,563
- For school?
- For school.

338
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,642
- If it's for school, right?
- Right.

339
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,648
- He's still grounded.
- Right. Okay.

340
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,150
It's work.

341
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,230
Okay.

342
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,611
- Okay.
- Be quick.

343
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,192
- Understood.
- Be back for dinner.

344
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,244
Deal.

345
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,117
- Bye.
- And behave yourself.

346
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,122
Our little boy.

347
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,004
I can't believe I just agreed to that.

348
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,587
God, Karen.
I remember when she was just a child.

349
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,759
She's kind of hot now.

350
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,176
- She's sweet. And kind.
- Sweet. Did I... I meant kind.

351
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,593
- And he's a good boy.
- Yeah.

352
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:35,350
All right, I see the resemblance, but I
really don't think this is you, Nathan.

353
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,186
Okay, good. Tell me why.

354
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,111
First of all,
this kid's three-and-a-half years old.

355
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,862
Don't we all look the same at that age?

356
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:47,946
Yes. But we have the same exact chin.

357
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,120
Coincidence.

358
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,867
Fine. Explain this.

359
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,996
Okay. It's a similar shirt.

360
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,331
Not just the shirt.

361
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,041
The stain on the left shoulder.

362
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,515
Here. Look.

363
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,643
Holy shit.

364
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,568
Online contact.

365
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,322
Steven Price.

366
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,061
My name is Marisa.

367
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,398
Marisa?

368
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,025
Nathan...

369
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,695
Possibly.

370
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,367
Can you tell me more?

371
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,171
I mean, I don't get it.

372
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,759
Don't you think it's weird that
she wants to know what your address is?

373
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,187
Why does it matter where you are now?

374
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,185
You could just be tipping them off.

375
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,187
It's really suspicious to me, Nathan.
It doesn't feel right.

376
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,233
Don't you think you should
talk to your parents about this?

377
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,906
Mr. Kozlow.

378
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,910
You wanted me to notify you immediately
if the website got a hit.

379
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,421
And if anyone ever finds out,
then you're gonna get in trouble

380
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,998
'cause it's probably a false accusation.

381
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,834
And then I'm gonna get in trouble
because now I'm involved, too.

382
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,009
Don't you think it's weird?

383
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,597
Maybe this is all just a mistake.

384
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,303
You could be adopted.

385
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,764
You know, dropped on a doorstep.
You never know.

386
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,226
If I were adopted,

387
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,654
why would my picture
end up on a missing persons website?

388
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,324
A better question would be

389
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,821
if this is for real, then who are
those people living in your house?

390
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,743
We're gonna
be out there, We're gonna dive...

391
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,541
He's gonna wanna dive with us, okay?

392
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,669
We need you to study. All right?

393
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,211
Rigging. How weather changes.

394
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,164
There'll be times your
mother and I are asleep.

395
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,341
You got to take the helm.
Our lives will be in your hands.

396
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,215
I don't wanna make this sound too ominous,
but it's dangerous out there.

397
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,763
The ocean is a big scary beast, man.

398
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,861
What you got there?

399
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,447
Um...

400
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,448
I lost my driver's license.

401
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,787
Need this to get a new one.

402
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,365
That what's really going on?

403
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,287
Yeah, what else would be going on?

404
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,118
You're not getting a fake ID?

405
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,121
No.

406
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,209
- What's going on, man?
- Oh, man.

407
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,090
- I don't know.
- Must be losing my mind.

408
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,217
My parents are too boring to be psychos.

409
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,390
Hey, you never Know, man.

410
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,552
Now here's you at two years old.

411
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,557
Three-ish.

412
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,684
Five.

413
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,438
Nice. Nice.

414
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,781
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

415
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,736
Okay. You see this picture of you
when you were five?

416
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,570
- Yeah, why?
- It's cropped weird.

417
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,827
Slight outline of a person's shoulder.

418
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,541
Clearly zoomed in a touch,

419
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,994
like someone didn't
wanna be seen in this picture.

420
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,079
Any more photographs
of you when you were younger?

421
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,835
Those are the ones that are questionable.

422
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,211
Not really.

423
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,708
Just a ton more of me by myself.

424
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,303
A few family photos
is all you have from your childhood?

425
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,220
All that I could find.

426
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,471
Nathan, I've got a million
embarrassing family photos.

427
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,150
Enough to make me wanna vomit.
And you're telling me all you have is two?

428
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,079
What? You're too cool to say hi now?

429
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,538
Hi.

430
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,932
Teenagers.

431
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,943
Hi, bud.

432
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,988
What you looking at?

433
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,465
Your baby shirt.

434
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,010
Are you my mother?

435
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,266
You are my son.

436
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,641
You don't understand, baby.
It's complicated.

437
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,063
Answer me.

438
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,438
Are you my mother?

439
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,945
No, Nathan. I'm not.

440
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,739
We wanted to tell you for so long
and we just couldn't.

441
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,954
Go ahead. Tell me. All of it.

442
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,794
Kevin's a part of this. I gotta go.

443
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,510
Sweetie, don't judge us
so quickly, all right?

444
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,466
You don't know.

445
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,266
I love you.

446
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,806
You're what's made us a family.

447
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,611
I love you and you're my son.
Nothing's gonna change that.

448
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,940
Don't.

449
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,870
Don't.

450
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,491
I'm so sorry.

451
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,415
Don't hate me, okay?

452
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,590
Gotta go get your dad.

453
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,356
- Yeah?
- Hey. I heard you pull up, so...

454
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,768
Karen, it's true. My mom just admitted it.

455
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,606
What? God, Nathan, you must be
freaking out. I'll be over in a minute.

456
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,986
Okay, come in the back door.

457
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,160
I'm so sorry.

458
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,299
- Ms. Harper?
- Yes.

459
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,726
- How are you this evening?
- Fine, thank you.

460
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,350
We're investigators with the
Bridgewater Juvenile Justice Department.

461
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:59,977
It's about your son Nathan.
I have a couple questions for him.

462
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,696
May we come in for a moment?

463
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,193
Wait, wait, wait!

464
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,240
Kev!

465
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,577
Where is he? Where is he?

466
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,458
Tell us where he is.

467
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,388
You can't have my son!

468
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,568
Who are you?

469
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,584
Get it started. I'll get the kid.

470
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,261
Mara.

471
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,066
Go, Nathan, go! Go now!

472
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,822
No, Son. Run!

473
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,778
And don't stop!

474
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,840
Karen.

475
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,765
Hey. Get in the house.

476
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,065
Come on, move.

477
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,733
It's going to be all right.
You're gonna be fine.

478
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,533
You won't even feel this.
Such a waste, you know that?

479
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,610
Hey!

480
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,745
Who are you?

481
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,659
Who are you? Answer me! Answer me!

482
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,833
Nathan, stop.

483
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,331
You killed my parents!

484
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,505
Stop. Stop.
I'll tell you what you need to know.

485
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,751
But I'm not dying here.
There's a bomb in the oven.

486
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,673
What?

487
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,971
Oh, my God!

488
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,741
Dive!

489
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,111
Sir, you're next.

490
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,582
DR Pedway...

491
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,380
Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.

492
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,812
- How bad is it?
- I don't know. It hurts.

493
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,183
I'm taking you to the hospital.

494
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,508
We need a doctor. Anybody?
We need a doctor, please.

495
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,188
Hello? Hello?

496
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,653
- 911.
- What's your emergency?

497
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,366
My parents were just murdered.

498
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,116
And I think the people who did it
are after me, too.

499
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,242
What's your location, sir?

500
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,960
I'm at a hospital.

501
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,745
Vassar Brothers Hospital.

502
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,798
But my parents were killed
at 2009 Clearwater Drive.

503
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,337
Please hold.

504
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,470
Hold? What do you mean, "Hold"?

505
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,551
Clearwater Drive.

506
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:31,184
I'm Slade McKassen- Topping our news,
a dramatic fire in suburban Bridgewater

507
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,481
believed to have been caused by a gas leak.

508
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,810
There have been
no reported injuries at this time.

509
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,357
Police say the residents were out of town
at the time of the incident.

510
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,154
We'll have more later on in our broadcast.

511
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,491
Nathan?

512
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,903
Nathan, are you there?

513
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,823
- Yes.
- Are you okay?

514
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,292
I'm shaken up a bit, but...
Wait. How'd you know my name?

515
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,375
My name's Frank Burton.

516
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,252
- I work for the CIA.
- The CIA?

517
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,425
Why am I talking to the CIA?

518
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,098
I need to know if you're okay.

519
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,345
Am I okay?

520
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,010
I just saw my parents get murdered

521
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,596
in front of my eyes.

522
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,273
Have you spoken to anyone
since the incident?

523
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,396
- Beside Karen Murphy?
- No.

524
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,149
Good. Don't talk to anyone.
Don't contact anyone.

525
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,275
Stay right where you are.

526
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,152
There'll be two men
coming to find you shortly.

527
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,154
One's wearing a red flannel shirt.

528
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,325
They're there to help you.

529
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,403
Nathan, you have to trust me.

530
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,829
Trust needs to be earned.

531
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,037
Nathan? Nathan?

532
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,206
Why am I talking to the CIA?

533
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,714
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

534
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,923
I just saw my parents get murdered
in front of my eyes.

535
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,717
Yeah?

536
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,682
They're at Vassar Brothers Hospital.
It's about 10 minutes away.

537
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,608
One of the ER doctors
will come check on you soon.

538
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,360
I want the video feeds from every
security camera in that hospital.

539
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,284
Put this On.

540
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,825
What?

541
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,494
Dr. Bennett? What are you doing here?

542
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,330
There's no time to explain, Nathan.
We've gotta get out of here.

543
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,710
Put that on. Walk behind me.

544
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,587
Cover your face from the cameras.

545
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,464
What do you have
to do with all this?

546
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,011
I'm a friend of your father's.

547
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,508
My father was just killed.

548
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,932
I'm talking about your real father.

549
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,185
- Wait.
- What?

550
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,432
Karen.

551
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,310
There's no time. I came for you, Nathan.

552
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,524
I'm not leaving without her.

553
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,942
They're here already.

554
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,202
- We're on site.
- Where's my surveillance video?

555
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,490
- Hey.
- Hi.

556
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,207
It's okay. She's my...

557
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,039
Doesn't matter. Let's go.

558
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,290
Yeah.

559
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,213
I'm looking for these two teenagers.

560
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,757
My nephew and his girlfriend.
They run away.

561
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,592
Go fast.

562
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,226
Faster.

563
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,851
Come on.

564
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,483
Left! Take the exit! Go left!

565
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,323
- We're in.
- Where are you, Nathan?

566
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,196
- Where is it?
- Over here.

567
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,499
I hate balloons.

568
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,706
We've got a hit.

569
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,135
We have a visual on the target.

570
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,259
Garage. Second floor.

571
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,763
Stop!

572
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,012
- Target is fleeing.
- Westbound. Late model silver BMW.

573
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,232
- We 're in pursuit.
- Stay on him.

574
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,438
- MALE AGENT 22 Sir.
- What?

575
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,566
FaceRec got another hit.
You should take a look.

576
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,780
You can kiss your pension goodbye, Geri.

577
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,865
Nathan.

578
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,949
There'll be time for you
to deal emotionally with all of this,

579
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,033
but right now,
you have to get your shit together.

580
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,212
Who are you really?

581
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,253
Agent Brock, target is proceeding south.

582
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,506
I'm one of your keepers, Nathan.
I'm put in place to look after you.

583
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,055
Just like Mara and Kevin were.
They died protecting you.

584
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,132
This is crazy.
Call the police or something.

585
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,809
I already tried.
I dialed 911 back at the hospital,

586
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,604
and some guy came on the line
saying he was with the CIA.

587
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,015
- Frank Burton.
- Burton? I work for him.

588
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,357
- What?
- Or I did.

589
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,393
He can't be trusted.

590
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,524
There were only four of us
who knew your identity.

591
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,528
Mara, Kevin, me and Burton.
Two of us are dead.

592
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,532
Until I can get in touch with Martin,
we have to consider Burton unreliable.

593
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,656
Target heading
west over the Fourth Street Bridge.

594
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,417
Here. 4-3-1-1 Clarendon Boulevard.

595
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,499
Apartment 2. Arlington, Virginia.
Memorize the address.

596
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,926
Find your way there and just sit tight
until someone contacts you.

597
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,674
What? We're just supposed to
wait for someone?

598
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,973
It's the arrangement I made with your father
in case something like this ever happened.

599
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,551
Who is my father? Who were my real parents?

600
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,094
She has heard too much already.

601
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,394
- What?
- Are you serious?

602
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,938
As soon as you can, dump those clothes.

603
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:26,141
Agent Brock,
we 're recalculating the coordinates.

604
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,601
Now in less than 20 seconds,

605
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,606
we're gonna hit a soft curve
just before the bridge.

606
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,983
I'm gonna slow down
just enough for you to jump out.

607
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,191
- Jump? What?
- Their field of vision will be obscured.

608
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,616
It's 30 feet down to the river.

609
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,785
- Dr. Bennett, this is insane.
- Fifteen seconds.

610
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,283
And remember, from now on,
do not trust anybody

611
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,457
except Martin Price and Paul Rasmus.

612
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,410
I don't even know these people.
I need answers.

613
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,245
You've been looking for answers
your whole life.

614
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,298
You just didn't know what questions to ask.
You can do this, Nathan.

615
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,216
Now you have 10 seconds to open that door.

616
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,631
After you jump, I will create a diversion.

617
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,087
I don't know if I can handle this.

618
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,764
Five seconds. Leave the girl.
You're better off alone.

619
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,261
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Just trust me.

620
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:02,969
Take a breath.

621
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,474
- Jump! Now!
- It's going to be okay.

622
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,305
Ready... Jump!

623
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,109
Get out of here!

624
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,073
One lousy state trooper?
That's all you could get?

625
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,906
- Don't lose that kid.
- We're on it, chief.

626
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,345
Come on. Let's go.

627
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,309
All right, we have to get in the river.

628
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,611
- What? Why?
- Because he'll try and track us.

629
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:54,900
Right here.

630
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:58,949
Watch your feet.

631
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,417
Behind here.

632
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,351
Was Nathan Price in the Vehicle?

633
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,773
I want confirmation!

634
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:37,693
Okay, sit down. Relax.

635
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,985
You stay right here.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

636
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,661
Stay.

637
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,531
Hey. Come on.

638
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,030
It's okay.

639
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:55,869
You were crying in your sleep.

640
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,633
- I was dreaming about...
- I know.

641
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,266
You don't have to say it.

642
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,645
I have to get you home.

643
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,647
Nathan, I can't go home.

644
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,232
You'll be safe there.

645
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,067
I won't be safe there! We're not safe here!

646
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,618
We're not safe anywhere.

647
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,945
Come on. Let's go.

648
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,575
- Where are we gonna go now?
- Just walk.

649
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,158
I can't go back there, Nathan.
Don't you understand?

650
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,084
My parents are in Italy.
And even if they were home,

651
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,627
they can't protect me.

652
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,625
What are we supposed to do? Call 911 again?

653
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,583
Look. Whoever these people are,
whatever they want,

654
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,339
they're after me, not you.

655
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,543
I think they'll leave you alone.

656
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,004
Do you really believe that?

657
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,385
Or are you thinking about what
your therapist said back in the car?

658
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,137
- Your chances are better alone.
- No.

659
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,600
Of course not.

660
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:59,349
It's just, suddenly
everyone around me is dying, Karen.

661
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,314
And I don't want anything to happen to you.

662
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,728
We have to stick together, Nathan.

663
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,237
Who else are we gonna trust now,
except for each other?

664
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,200
Come on.

665
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,787
All right, here's the latest intel
we have on Martin Price's current mission.

666
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,374
Ten days ago, Martin Price obtained
a high-value piece of intel.

667
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,844
Specifically, a list of 25 encrypted names,

668
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,139
US politicians and intelligence officers,

669
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,889
all of whom had sold state secrets
at one time or another.

670
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:39,556
The list was stolen from this man.
Nikola Kozlow.

671
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:44,147
Ex-Serbian Secret Service.
Now, freelance intel broker and operative.

672
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,320
He wants it back. Badly.

673
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,198
Yesterday, there was
an attack on the residence

674
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:50,950
where Martin's son Nathan lived.

675
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,698
Two of our undercover agents were killed.

676
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,529
The attackers were hired guns. Btrava.

677
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,992
Connections tracing them
all the way back to Nikola Kozlow.

678
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,374
Martin Price is the agency's
most valuable black ops agent.

679
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,878
Keeping his son Nathan safe from Kozlow
is our top priority.

680
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,583
How did Kozlow find Martin's son?

681
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,344
We think he discovered
the existence of the boy

682
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:13,343
a couple of years ago
through a cyber attack.

683
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,268
He's been phishing ever since
with fake missing persons websites.

684
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,013
One of his traps finally worked.

685
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,515
Nathan Price is the bargaining chip.

686
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,316
How so?

687
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,984
If Kozlow gets to the kid before we do,

688
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,361
he gets the list off Martin.

689
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,034
What do I need to know
that you're not telling me?

690
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,578
The boy escaped from us last night

691
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,032
with some help from a veteran operative.

692
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,616
Geri Bennett.

693
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:44,791
Her vehicle was empty when we got there.
No sign of her. No sign of the kids.

694
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,501
Frank.

695
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:59,143
Get this situation under control
before things get any messier.

696
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,239
- Hey, can you take us to Virginia?
- Get in.

697
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,954
- It's crunch time, Frank.
- Yeah, where the hell is Martin?

698
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,452
Last contact we had
was the Peshawar drop two days ago.

699
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,954
He's vanished since then.

700
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,252
- The fastest he can make it back here...
- Is about 36 hours,

701
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,170
which is how long we've
got to find this kid.

702
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,461
Track the girl. Track his friends.

703
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,009
Track anyone they've ever spoken to.

704
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:37,052
Put out an alert to all overseas stations.
Get a fix on Nikola Kozlow.

705
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,425
If they can't locate him,
that means he's probably already here.

706
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,260
So we can add him
to our list of headaches as well.

707
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,513
Clarendon Avenue. This is the street.

708
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,902
Hello?

709
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:16,113
"Lorna Price. 1-7-9-3-7 Calvary Road. "

710
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,906
"G-3-7-7."

711
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,412
What is it?

712
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,494
- I know this woman.
- Who is she?

713
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:33,918
I think she's my mother.

714
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,214
This must be Martin Price's apartment.

715
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,355
I'm gonna call my uncle.

716
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:52,482
Let him know I'm still alive.

717
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,274
- Hello?
- Uncle Danny?

718
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,319
I'm sorry,
I must have dialed the wrong number.

719
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,824
Karen? Karen Murphy, is that you?

720
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,998
Who is this?

721
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,792
Someone who's trying to help
you and Nathan.

722
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,335
How do you know my name?

723
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,960
You're in danger, Karen.

724
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,589
There are other people trying to find you.

725
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,259
- Who is this?
- Nathan?

726
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,721
Listen to me, Nathan,
we're going to find you.

727
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,521
You can't hide from us.
For your own safety...

728
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,268
Let's go.

729
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:33,933
Kids.

730
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,525
Thanks.

731
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,147
This address could be 15 years old.

732
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,188
You know the chances
of finding your mother living there are...

733
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,066
I know. But it's all we have.

734
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,336
- This is an odd address.
- Look at the numbering.

735
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,712
G-3-7-7.

736
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,886
That's her plot number.

737
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,386
You know what's messed up?

738
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,846
I never knew either one of my mothers.

739
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,351
The one who raised me,

740
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,778
I had no clue who she really was

741
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,572
or what she sacrificed for me.

742
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,902
And Lorna Price.

743
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,238
All she was, was a face in a dream.

744
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,824
Now she has a name.

745
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,919
But she's still a dead end.

746
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,624
Nathan, maybe she's not a dead end.

747
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,928
These flowers are fresh.

748
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,423
I'll handle this.

749
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,644
- Hello.
- Hi. How can I help you?

750
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,932
My brother and I just came
from visiting our mother's grave

751
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,770
and we saw that some flowers
had been delivered there recently.

752
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,947
Is there any way you could check
and see who sent them?

753
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,241
We came a really long way to visit her.

754
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,071
Couldn't you just help out
with this little favor?

755
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,377
- Okay. What's the name?
- Lorna Price.

756
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,387
Okay, so the flowers came
from Omaha, Nebraska.

757
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,215
A Mr. P. Rasmus.

758
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,268
It looks like it's going to be
a longstanding order.

759
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,138
Do you have an address for that?

760
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,019
SIGNIT just got a hit
on a name Lorna Price.

761
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,980
Came from a computer
in a place called Calvary Cemetery.

762
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,107
Calvary Cemetery.

763
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:14,320
The CIA is mobilizing
a strike team out of Pittsburgh.

764
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,496
Dr. Bennett said we could
trust Paul Rasmus.

765
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,622
We have to find him.

766
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,294
You want to drive to Nebraska?

767
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,340
No. We've probably been
in this car too long already.

768
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,882
- We need to ditch it.
- What then?

769
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,505
We'd never even make it
through airport security.

770
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,756
They know our names, our faces.

771
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,383
I know. I have another plan.

772
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,619
Tuscarora Pike. Route 15.

773
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,947
You're very close to them.

774
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,477
- Dude.
- Hey, man.

775
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,517
These guys came to my house
asking questions.

776
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,146
I had to sneak out back.
This is some deep, deep shit.

777
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,942
Did you bring what I asked for?

778
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,986
Yeah, three different IDs
in three different states.

779
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,313
- Yeah, that works.
- Karen.

780
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,524
I went through all your Facebook photos.

781
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,826
I chose the one of you
from that pep rally last month

782
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,744
'cause I thought you
looked really good in it.

783
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,992
- But I could use the one from the beach...
- These will be fine.

784
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,573
- Thanks, Gilly.
- Cool.

785
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,790
Let's move. We should get going now.

786
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,542
This isn't safe for any of us.

787
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,087
I'm sorry about your parents.

788
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,550
Listen, if there's anything else
I could do for you,

789
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,849
if you need cash or...

790
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,676
We're okay.

791
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,812
See you, Gilly.

792
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,685
- Thanks, man.
- See you.

793
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,910
Tell me when you have him.

794
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,677
Amtrak train 29, the Capitol Limited

795
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,477
from Pittsburgh to Omaha
is now boarding on track seven.

796
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,097
Step this way, please.

797
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:49,854
- Thank you. Enjoy your trip.
- I will.

798
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,907
Capitol Limited, Pittsburgh to Omaha...

799
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,827
- Is now boarding on track 7.
- Go ahead.

800
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,337
- Have a nice trip.
- Once again, Amtrak train 29

801
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,635
now boarding on track 7.

802
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,404
Good thing it's only one night.

803
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,327
Mmm-hmm.

804
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,875
Do you remember that summer when

805
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,504
our families were both
staying at Canadohta Lake?

806
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,973
After eighth grade.

807
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:08,976
In the boathouse, we
skipped the canoe trip.

808
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,275
Yeah. I remember.

809
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,228
Kind of.

810
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,903
When we came back to school that year,

811
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,027
how come you never asked me out?

812
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,994
I don't know.

813
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,248
I just thought summer was summer and...

814
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,296
Are we gonna die, Nathan?

815
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:48,184
No.

816
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,600
I won't let that happen.

817
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,631
- Wow.
- What?

818
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:25,801
That's better than middle school.

819
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,980
That's 'cause I know what I'm doing now.

820
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,982
And no braces, either.

821
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:26,612
We should get some food.

822
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,368
Yeah. I'm starving.

823
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,378
I'll go.

824
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,547
Okay.

825
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:49,514
I'll knock twice before keying in.

826
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,887
All right.

827
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:10,368
I'm on a train, heading south of the city.

828
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,070
Very good.

829
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,656
We're coming up on the Cincinnati station.

830
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,286
We'll be waiting at the next stop.

831
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,754
I'm so hungry.

832
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,752
He might like that.

833
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,158
Shut up!

834
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:11,255
Tell me what room he's in.

835
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,968
No, no, no.

836
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,433
Pretty fingers.

837
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,313
Tell me the room. Now.

838
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,924
You're gonna play some more, huh?

839
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,255
You little man.

840
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,402
Come on, Nathan! Use your anger.

841
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,482
Think about it. Keep control.

842
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,831
Come on, Nathan! Do something!
You're gonna go down here!

843
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,724
What can you do? Focus.

844
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,015
Think about it. Think.

845
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,306
Think about it.

846
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,079
Come on.

847
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,545
Hey, hey!

848
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,018
Watch it.

849
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,395
Hold on. I need to catch a breath.

850
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,241
Okay.

851
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,719
He really is Martin's fucking kid.

852
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,525
They can't have got very far on foot.

853
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,323
Let's round them up. Wrap up this thing.

854
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:34,578
I didn't get it until now.

855
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:38,707
All that time spent training,
wrestling, sparring.

856
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:43,219
He was preparing me. For this moment.

857
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,807
A few days ago,
we were just a couple of high school kids.

858
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,727
Already feels like a lifetime ago.

859
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,394
Because it was.

860
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,486
Agent Burns,
we have a visual on the target.

861
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,412
Going south on Route 51.

862
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:19,539
- Come on.
- Kid!

863
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,715
Give it up, kid!

864
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,755
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

865
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,266
Come on, why are you running?

866
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,302
Look around.

867
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,096
Is anybody pointing a gun at you?

868
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:37,265
We're not threatening you.

869
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,277
If you're really the CIA,
what's my real name?

870
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,945
Nathan Price.

871
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,990
Steven. Steven Price.

872
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,192
Steven's your middle name.

873
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:51,279
They argued about it,
but your mom thought Nathan was better.

874
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,114
- How do you know that?
- I was at the hospital

875
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,995
the night you were born, Nathan.

876
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,833
What do you want?

877
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,128
I'd like to get out of
this dirt, for starters.

878
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:03,208
You kids, you been on the run
for what, 22 hours? Gotta be hungry.

879
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,798
How about I buy you a burger
and a milkshake?

880
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,279
You must have been hungry.

881
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,835
Karen, could I have
some alone time with Nathan?

882
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,499
Agent Burns will help you
tend to those bruises.

883
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,712
Come sit over here.

884
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,349
You must have a lot of questions.

885
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,927
Who killed my parents?

886
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,012
- You mean Mara and Kevin?
- Yes.

887
01:15:58,345 --> 01:15:59,722
His name is Nikola Kozlow.

888
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,399
He's an independent black ops agent.

889
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:03,768
Like...

890
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,612
- Like my father?
- Yes.

891
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:11,274
But Kozlow works for the bad guys.
Martin is...

892
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,618
Was one of us.

893
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,447
The woman you know as Dr. Bennett
trained him.

894
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,327
Lorna, too.

895
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,620
Whose idea was it to put me in

896
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,707
foster care, or whatever you wanna call it?

897
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,799
When your mother died...

898
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:30,799
To be honest, we weren't sure
whether Martin was gonna crack or not.

899
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:34,303
He was in no condition to raise a child.
He realized that.

900
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,101
I told him I would make sure you were safe,

901
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,679
so Martin could carry on
doing what Martin does.

902
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:40,979
What exactly is that?

903
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,807
It's a messy world, Nathan.

904
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,315
People like Martin and Kozlow
are just two sides of the same coin.

905
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,251
Listen, kid.

906
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:14,009
The world you've just been dropped into
is a world very few people get to see.

907
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:16,182
You're getting a glimpse
behind the curtain.

908
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:19,723
What we're engaged in here is a polite war.

909
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:23,477
It's not about bullets and bombs,
borders or territories.

910
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,105
The currency of this war is information.

911
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,068
Zeroes and ones, Nathan.

912
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,272
Data. And that's what Kozlow's after.

913
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,820
What does Kozlow want from me?

914
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,531
Martin recently stole
something very valuable from Kozlow

915
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,160
and he wants it back.

916
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,370
If Kozlow gets you, it puts your father
in a very compromised position.

917
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:50,549
Why should my father
suddenly start caring about me now?

918
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,215
Nathan, you don't know
the first thing about your father.

919
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,761
I know he scares the shit out of you.

920
01:17:58,757 --> 01:17:59,804
Mmm.

921
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:03,308
Byers, report. Torres, report.

922
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,314
Torres, report.

923
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,817
This thing that Kozlow wants so badly,

924
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,744
what my father stole, what is it?

925
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:23,533
To the naked eye, it's a sequence of
meaningless numbers and letters.

926
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,914
It's actually an encrypted
list of 25 people

927
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,917
who have sold or traded state secrets.

928
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,463
Do you have any idea how valuable that
kind of information is, Nathan?

929
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,347
Your name's on that list, isn't it?

930
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,686
You have a vivid imagination.

931
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,600
That's a very dangerous thing.

932
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:55,064
Go! Go! Go!

933
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,116
Drop!

934
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,318
- Get down!
- Stay down!

935
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,573
Get behind something solid.

936
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,088
Stay here and keep your heads down.

937
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,927
Stay down!

938
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:25,552
Come on.

939
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,859
Nathan? Nathan?

940
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,254
What the hell is going on, Nathan?

941
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,503
My parents' murder,
everything we've been through,

942
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,754
it's all about a damn list.

943
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:59,712
- What list?
- A list of names my father stole.

944
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,971
This guy Kozlow came after me, thinking
he'd force my father to give it back.

945
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:09,268
The crazy part is I've had it all along
and didn't even realize it.

946
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:11,936
It's in the phone
I picked up back at the apartment.

947
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:15,152
Martin must have
texted it to himself for safekeeping.

948
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,446
Jesus, Nathan,
why didn't you give it to the CIA?

949
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:21,321
Because Dr. Bennett was right about
not trusting Burton.

950
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,448
We're on our own.

951
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:31,914
Where'd you get that phone?

952
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,621
The guy on the train who attacked us.

953
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,457
Hello?

954
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,088
Convenient thing with cell phones,

955
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,513
they can be turned into
listening devices, as well.

956
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:44,841
- Kozlow.
- You have something that belongs to me.

957
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,550
Now it's time to give it back.

958
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,227
What use is it to you?
Don't be a foolish boy.

959
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:51,101
Hand it over and you'll be left alone.

960
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,603
What kind of guarantee can you give me?

961
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,059
I can guarantee this.

962
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:59,318
If you don't surrender that list,
I will be killing every friend you have.

963
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,615
Jake, Gilly, neighbors.

964
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,488
Even your boring teachers.

965
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,241
And when I'm finished,
you'll be responsible for the death

966
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,288
of every friend you have on Facebook.

967
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:13,540
But I think it's one person in particular
you don't want to see get hurt.

968
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,958
Am I right, Nathan? Her parents arrive

969
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:21,010
on Alitalia flight 4-4-9
tomorrow afternoon at 3:20 p. m.

970
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,713
If I don't have the list by then,

971
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,093
they're dead.

972
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:28,767
You can tell her all about
what it's like to lose your parents.

973
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:33,063
It's a feeling you must know by now.
Am I right, Nathan? Or am I right?

974
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:37,018
Okay. Okay.
So, how do you propose we do this?

975
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,778
Simple. I give you a time and a place.

976
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:42,572
No. I'll pick the time and place.

977
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:44,949
Somewhere public.

978
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,620
Someone backtracked our signal!

979
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,756
Let's go, guys!

980
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,343
Don't move!

981
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:07,047
Good.

982
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,425
I'm only sorry
there weren't more of them there.

983
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,226
Yes, sin Another thing.

984
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,020
- What?
- We found a digital record.

985
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,393
- Nathan Harper has the list.
- No, no, no!

986
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,474
He's on his way to meet with Kozlow
to hand it oven.

987
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:18,650
Where?

988
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,049
- Were you followed?
- No, I don't think so.

989
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:44,798
I took my 80-year-old neighbor's car.
Can't you tell it smells in here?

990
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:46,424
Did you do what I asked?

991
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,970
- Did you?
- Yeah, man, just like you said.

992
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:59,817
Patio section. VIP access only.
It's under 23D.

993
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:05,439
- Thanks, man.
- Good luck.

994
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,739
I wish there was another way.

995
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,821
So do I.

996
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,217
I assure you,
I have the situation under control.

997
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,293
Do you have the boy?

998
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,377
No.

999
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:28,929
- Do you have the list?
- No, but...

1000
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,598
Then you don't have things
under control, Frank.

1001
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,602
- Hello?
- Hello, Nathan.

1002
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,973
- Who is this?
- It's me.

1003
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,105
I need you to turn around
and walk out of that stadium, now.

1004
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,527
Martin?

1005
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,400
You sure have grown.

1006
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,981
I know veteran agents
who couldn't have handled

1007
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,658
what you've been through
in the past 24 hours.

1008
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:36,952
But you can't go in there.
Kozlow will take the list and he will kill you.

1009
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,287
Not if I kill him first.

1010
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:41,209
You're not ready for that.

1011
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,538
- I've made it this far, haven't I?
- You don't need to do this.

1012
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:46,590
I'm on my way. Just trust me, Nathan.
Give me a chance.

1013
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,509
- You had 15 years, Martin.
- Nathan, this is not the time for that.

1014
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,714
- I'm done waiting.
- Right now, you need to hear me out.

1015
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:18,330
- Nathan?
- The ticket's at the foot of the statue.

1016
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:55,701
Ticket. Please have your tickets ready.

1017
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:57,994
Thanks.

1018
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,503
Well?

1019
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:18,473
Where is this kid?

1020
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,592
Burns, do you have anything yet?

1021
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,093
Nothing yet, Frank.

1022
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:01,804
Where are you, kid?

1023
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:03,723
Excuse me.

1024
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,471
- Watch it. Get up.
- Hey!

1025
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:06,680
Jerk!

1026
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,318
Popcorn?

1027
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:25,707
I don't understand this game at all,
but I like popcorn.

1028
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,919
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

1029
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:42,053
What happened? What did I miss?

1030
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,147
You got my list?

1031
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,859
How do I know you won't kill me
once I give it to you?

1032
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,652
You don't trust me?

1033
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:58,406
You murdered my parents.

1034
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,152
They weren't your real parents.

1035
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:05,284
I can tell you all about your real parents,

1036
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,786
but I'm not so sure
you want to know the truth.

1037
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,715
What truth?

1038
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:20,429
Martin was, as they call, a Class 5,

1039
01:28:20,504 --> 01:28:23,804
which means he had the authority
to break the Geneva Convention.

1040
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:28,558
To kill women, children, whatever was
necessary to accomplish his mission.

1041
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,857
But your mother, on the
other hand, so loyal.

1042
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:37,359
She wouldn't give up Martin's location
even to save her own life.

1043
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,445
You killed her.

1044
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:42,905
Wasn't my intention.

1045
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,494
She was a stubborn woman.

1046
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,543
Do you remember, Nathan?

1047
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,958
You should. You were there, too.

1048
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:56,127
Paris, 1995.

1049
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,167
Nathan, think.

1050
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,921
It's a funny thing, the human mind.

1051
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,178
I'm trained to pay attention to details,
from the hair on your neck

1052
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:10,729
to the location of
every security camera in this stadium.

1053
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:17,065
But in that hotel room,
I made one tiny, colossal mistake.

1054
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,651
I forgot to check under the bed.

1055
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:22,862
The bed.

1056
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:34,582
Nathan.

1057
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:45,930
GO! GO! GO!

1058
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,872
Is this what you're looking for?

1059
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:18,046
Now we have to give me
what we agreed upon, right, Nathan?

1060
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,586
Hey!

1061
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:25,257
Frank? I have location on Nathan.

1062
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,806
- Where is he?
- The seats above the visitors' box.

1063
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,178
And moving fast.

1064
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:35,806
Excuse me. Sorry!

1065
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,479
- Hey.
- Hey!

1066
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:42,942
Hey!

1067
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:51,446
I'm sorry.

1068
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,670
- Martin?
- You're alive. That's good. Where are you?

1069
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,847
In a shop on the upper level.

1070
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:13,265
Listen to me. I need you to lead him
outside to the south parking lot.

1071
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:14,595
If I do that, I'm dead.

1072
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:17,181
If you stay where you are,
you're dead for sure.

1073
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:20,016
- Lead him outside. Trust me.
- Why should I?

1074
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:23,566
Because I'm here, Son.

1075
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,042
- Hey!
- Watch it!

1076
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,054
Come on, Martin.

1077
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,859
Nathan!

1078
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,445
Nathan!

1079
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:51,278
Stop, I'll shoot!

1080
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,745
It's over, Nathan.

1081
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,581
Trust me, Nathan. I'm here, Son.

1082
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:07,916
You're not as good as your father, Nathan.

1083
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,128
You sure about that?

1084
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,893
Martin!

1085
01:33:39,197 --> 01:33:41,291
Nathan? I'll take that.

1086
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,417
You're just like your dad, huh?

1087
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,173
Let's go.

1088
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,767
I told you
we had the situation under control, sir.

1089
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,769
- I have it.
- Good work. Let me see it.

1090
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:06,850
- It's still encrypted, sir.
- That's all right.

1091
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:09,607
Let me get it to the lab and I'll make sure
you have the decrypted file

1092
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:11,359
on your desk first thing in the morning.

1093
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:12,939
That's funny.

1094
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:15,320
Martin said that would be the first sign.

1095
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,777
- You talked to Martin?
- He said that

1096
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,739
you'd insist on overseeing
decryption yourself,

1097
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:22,700
to give you a chance
to take your name off the list.

1098
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,874
Come on, Frank.

1099
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:30,381
We got a long debriefing ahead of us.

1100
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,550
Let him go.

1101
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:35,257
He's family.

1102
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,970
I'm sorry. For everything.

1103
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:43,553
I'll See you soon.

1104
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,396
- Martin?
- Mmm-hmm.

1105
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,439
Give the phone to my kid, Frank.

1106
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:55,444
He wants to speak to you.

1107
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,037
You're very brave, Nathan.

1108
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:03,410
I handled things with Hudson.

1109
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,912
You and Karen won't have to
worry about the agency from now on.

1110
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:07,710
Where are you?

1111
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:10,334
I'm right here. Watching from a distance.

1112
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:12,461
Like I always have.

1113
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:16,754
All I ever wanted was to keep you safe.
Make sure you didn't get hurt.

1114
01:35:16,836 --> 01:35:18,634
But I failed.

1115
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:21,011
I'm sorry, Nathan. I truly am.

1116
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,267
When can I see you?

1117
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:25,850
Why don't you come out here
and talk to me in person?

1118
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:28,398
I'd like that. More than you can imagine.

1119
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,105
- But it's not possible.
- Why not?

1120
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,729
I made certain choices a long time ago.

1121
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,940
I have to live with the consequences of
those choices, but you don't have to.

1122
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,276
Well, then it's up to me.

1123
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,032
I want to meet you.

1124
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:42,908
You don't understand the risk.

1125
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,785
I don't care about the risks.

1126
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,918
You remind me of your mother.

1127
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,753
Martin?

1128
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,131
Dad?

1129
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:57,628
Nathan.

1130
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,463
I'm your father,

1131
01:36:00,922 --> 01:36:03,095
but I'll never be your dad.

1132
01:36:03,508 --> 01:36:05,306
I lost that chance a long time ago.

1133
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,184
I don't know
if you can understand my reasons.

1134
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:09,765
Maybe someday you will.

1135
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:12,225
But you're the only family I have left.

1136
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,856
You're leaving me all alone.

1137
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,358
You're gonna be all right.

1138
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:19,358
Sorry, Son.

1139
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:23,452
Goodbye, Nathan.

1140
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:36,591
Nathan.

1141
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:04,952
Dr. Bennett?

1142
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,495
Hello, Nathan.

1143
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:08,660
Hi.

1144
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:10,997
Call me Geri.

1145
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:13,536
- I can't believe you're alive.
- Me?

1146
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:15,542
What about you guys?

1147
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:18,879
How are you doing with all of this?

1148
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,716
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1149
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,058
It's for your own protection.

1150
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,928
I know.

1151
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:32,100
But where do I go from here?

1152
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,435
Your father wanted me to talk to you about
making arrangements for a new home.

1153
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:39,692
- Nothing can replace Kevin and Mara.
- I know that.

1154
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,320
But we thought maybe you'd want to consider

1155
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:45,743
coming to live with me
until you finish high school.

1156
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:50,331
Then you have college and...

1157
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:52,955
You know, whatever else you want to pursue.

1158
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,495
How does that sound?

1159
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:00,500
Yeah, that sounds good.

1160
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,517
- Okey-dokey.
- So, shall we get out of here?

1161
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:16,270
Not quite yet.

1162
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,862
I'll make sure he gets home all right.

1163
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:22,355
Oh!

1164
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,988
I see. Okay. That's cool. I'll just...

1165
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,445
- You know, I'll be here.
- All right.

1166
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,160
And, Nathan,

1167
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:36,995
about a certain young lady, I was wrong.

1168
01:38:38,454 --> 01:38:40,331
You should hold onto her.

1169
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,459
Yeah.

1170
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:46,466
She's worth it.

1171
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:57,773
Sorry we missed the game.

1172
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,147
You can take me to another one.

1173
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:03,984
It's a date.

1174
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,737
So, you mean this isn't going to be like

1175
01:39:06,816 --> 01:39:09,695
eighth grade after the
boathouse between us?

1176
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:14,536
You know what the problem was
back in eighth grade?

1177
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,621
I just wasn't ready for you yet.

1178
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:23,542
Mmm. So I had to wait four years
for you to ask me out?

1179
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,045
Yeah.

1180
01:39:27,837 --> 01:39:29,839
But you gotta admit,

1181
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,095
it was one pretty exciting first date.

1182
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,348
Definitely.
