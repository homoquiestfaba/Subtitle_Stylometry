battle sounds)

00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:46,345
Mic: We gotta move.
Stay with him, he's your
life line!

00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:50,382
Mic: Follow me.
(muttering, breathing)
Stay with me guys!

00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,052
Mic: Incoming! This way.
(Gunshots)
Follow me, follow me!

00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,220
Tank: Recover north!
On our way!

8
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,027
Mic: Stay with me guys!
(Gunshots)
Ahh! Ah!

9
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:05,964
Mic: There's something down
there, I tripped over something.
Check it out!

10
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,766
Mic: Check around, there must
be something with that pipe.

11
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,702
Incoming!
Get them down,
get them down!

12
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,239
Mic: Right around where I was.
(overlapping chatter)

13
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,041
Mic: It's coming, it's coming
fast.

14
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,043
(Gunfire)
Perimeter, people!
give me a perimeter!

15
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,711
(overlapping chatter)

16
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,480
Big Guy: It's some
kind of tunnel.
Mic: Tank, come here.

17
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,482
(gunfire, yelling)

18
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:24,683

00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:38,497

Tank: Let's get down this hole.
Hook me up, Big Guy.

21
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,666
(Explosion)

22
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,267
Down you go.
All right.

23
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,746
(gunshots, overlapping chatter)

24
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,585

(slithering)

51
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,081
What the fuck?

52
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,022
(roar)

53
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,323
(growl)

54
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:11,563
(explosions)

55
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:34,085
General X: At 0300, I received
a Code 455.

56
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,593
This was one of two
of the last remaining,

57
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:45,964
non-infected, virus free
women on the planet.

58
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:50,035
At 0200, her life ended.

59
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,772
A victim of the OVT virus.

60
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,007
This...

61
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,945
...is the last non-infected,

62
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:04,583
virus free, fertile woman
alive.

63
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,620
She is your Package.

64
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,994
This female is to be shipped
off planet immediately.

65
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,165
At 1700 tonight,
along with the Package,

66
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,434
you will board the Oklahoma.

67
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,437
At 1800 you will be cryoslept

68
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,439
for a seven month travel.

69
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,875
Your 10-TSA
destination...

70
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,777
Earth Two.

71
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,347
The rumors are true.

72
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,619
We have been preparing a planet
for inhabitation.

73
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,688
Four years'
projected completion.

74
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,593
The Oklahoma will
land adjacent to a heavily
wooded area.

75
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,730
You will secure the Package
off the ship.

76
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:55,500
Walk the Package
200 feet to a transport.

77
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,304
Secure the Package
on the transport.

78
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,407
Our nation has asked
for the best unit.

79
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,944
A unit that has never
lost a single Package.

80
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,114
You are that unit.

81
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,784
Let me be crystal,

82
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,120
should a situation arise.

83
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:20,759
Her pain, strain,
cries or demands

84
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,228
are of no significance.

85
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,097
Not to me,
not to you.

86
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,200
This Package gets delivered.

87
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,680
(whispering)
Thank you, Tank.

88
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,542
(alien noises)

89
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,455
(sigh) Oh, fuck.

90
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,407
(alien chirping)

91
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,842
(chirping)

92
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,579
(roar)
Mic: Ahhhh!

93
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,248
(roaring continues)

94
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,185
What the fuck is that?

95
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,761
How you wanna play this, chief?

96
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,363
(click, beeps)

97
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,633
(beeping)

98
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,335
Sniper: Get down!

99
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,405
Down!

100
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,175
(beeping)

101
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,047
(explosion)

102
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,363
Tank: Doc.

103
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,765
Tank: Doc!

104
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,912
(Breath) Oh..

105
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,818
Tank: Snoop!

106
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,926
Snoop: Oh, Jesus.

107
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,631
Snoop, go get the Doc.

108
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,867
Yeah.

109
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,177
Sniper: Did we stop it?
Tank: Just be still, man.

110
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,047
Snoop: Doc, we need you.
Let's go.

111
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,216
Doc: I'm not,
I'm not leaving her.

112
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,253
Snoop: We're not leaving her.
Come on, you come with me.

113
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,960
Doc: Can you move your legs
or your feet?

114
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,030
Doc: The knife.

115
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,468
Doc: Can you feel that?
Sniper: No.

116
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,873
Doc: Can you feel that?

117
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,475
Sniper: Feel what?

118
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,344
Doc: He's intact.
Back's not broke.

119
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,180
Doc: Could wear-- (dirt
falling)

120
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,233
(muffled digging)

121
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,935
Tank: Snoop!
Snoop: I'm on it!

122
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,016
Sniper: Snoop, talk to me.

123
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,954
Snoop: I'm working on it,
I don't see anything yet,
I'm not through.

124
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,255
Doc: We have to move

125
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,623
Snoop: Few more seconds.

126
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,528
Sniper: You got eyes?
Snoop: No, not yet.

127
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,965
Doc: Can we at least
move away from this?

128
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,900
Snoop: Just give me time.

129
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,236
Sniper: Come on man,
this is taking too long.

130
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,840
Doc: I wanna get out of here.
I-I wanna go, I wanna leave.

131
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,876
Sniper: We definitely have
company in here.

132
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,980
Sniper: Ah, fuck.
Okay, the order.

133
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,251
Protocol.
Tank leads.

134
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,720
Then Package.
Doc, go.

135
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,456
Doc: I'm gonna leave,
Doc: I'm gonna get outta here.
Tank: You bring him Snoop!

136
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,425
Sniper: Go!
Tank: Move!

137
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,627
Sniper: Snoop.

138
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,530
Snoop: I-I'm looking I don't --

139
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,099
Snoop: Give me a minute,
I-I've gotta find it.

140
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,901
Sniper: We don't have
a fucking minute!

141
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,005
Sniper: Talk to me, come on --

142
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,309
Sniper: -- keep talking to me!
Snoop: I-I don't see anything --

143
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,977
Snoop: Hol-hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

144
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,980
Sniper: Can't see nothing?!
Snoop: Let me move it around,
hold on, hold on!

145
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:25,189
(frantic breathing)

146
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,326
Doc: Can one of you
tell me what the hell
just happened up there?

147
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,862
Doc: I thought this planet was
classified blue?

148
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,231
Tank: (breathing heavily)
It was blue.
It was, I --

149
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:41,005
Sniper: Gimme a minute, I-I can
see this through my goggles,
there's nothing --

150
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,707
Sniper: Well, stick your ear
to the hole.
Snoop: I'm --

151
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,946
(Frantic breathing)

152
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,180
(lock clicks)

153
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,618
Snoop: There's nothing there.
Shit.

154
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,891
Tank: When I say,
you're gonna pull this lever.

155
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,527
Tank: As soon as it opens, you
gotta turn this,

156
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,696
and you're gonna
yank the door open.

157
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,832
Tank: As soon as it opens,
you get behind it and stay back!

158
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,500
Sniper: Jesus Christ.

159
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,010
(heavy breathing)

160
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,144
Tank: Now!

161
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,414
(hatch door clicks, opens)

162
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,052
Sniper: Snoop?

163
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,589
(flashlight thud echoes
in tunnel)

164
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,736
(growling, loud thud,
dirt falling)
Sniper: Snoop!

165
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,205
(long roar)

166
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,474
Snoop: Tank!

167
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,545
Snoop: Tank!

168
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,848
Tank: Crawl!
We gotta crawl!

169
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,517
Snoop: We gotta what?!

170
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,719
Tank: (Yelling)
We have to, craw --!

171
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,566
Doc: How do you know
those things aren't in there?

172
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,772
Tank: Doc...

173
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,975
Tank: Rifle.

174
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,616
(tunnel creaking)

175
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,624
Snoop: Go, we gotta
get outta here.

176
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,394
Sniper: Ah, ah, ugh.
Snoop: Come on, come on.

177
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,599
(breathing)

178
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,648
Snoop: Come on, man.
Hold tight.
Sniper: Ah! Ah!

179
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,628
Tank: Let's go!

180
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:23,501
Snoop: Okay, hold on.

181
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,472
Snoop: Grab the gear,
and get us the hell outta here.

182
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,659
(grunts)

183
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,864
Snoop: I'm gonna get up
in this hole,
and I'll pull you up.

184
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,365
Snoop: Hold tight Snipe.

185
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,172
(heavy breathing)

186
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,075
Tank: Okay --

187
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,247
Tank: Rest for minute,
but stay to the side
and stay down.

188
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:16,921
(heavy breathing)

189
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,369
(hatch door clicks, latches)

190
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,770
Snoop: The door's closed.

191
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,543
Snoop: Snipe.

192
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:42,680
Snoop: (muffled) Hey!
The door's closed!
(coughing)

193
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,449
Snoop: (muffled)
Damn.

194
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,486
Snoop: What the? Snipe!

195
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,720
Snoop: (muffled)
Snipe!

196
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,624
(groan)

197
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,433
(gun clicks)
Sniper: Oh, you ugly --

198
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,370
Come on.

199
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,705

Come on. I've got you ya fu --
Oh, Jesus Christ.

201
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,115
Come on!
Come on, ya motherfucker!

202
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,417
(growling)

203
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,852
(earth moving)

204
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,122
(gunshots)

205
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,991
Sniper: Come on, come on!

206
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,061
(gunshots, earth moving)

207
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,598
Come on.
I got you.

208
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,038
(roars)

209
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,607
Snoop: Fuck!

210
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:47,845
(muffled growling and screaming)

211
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,449
Doc: Tank --

212
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,820
Tank: Doc --

213
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,190
Package: You don't think it
stopped it, do you?

214
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,795
Package: Tank?

215
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,731
Tank: Be quiet, okay?

216
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,333
I need to hear this thing
because if I can't hear it,

217
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,636
I don't hear it coming.
All right?

218
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,805
Tank: Come on.

219
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,780
(grunts)

220
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,958
(breathing, tunnel creaking)

221
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,505
Tank: Okay, let's move.

222
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,889
(distant banging)

223
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,327
(more distant banging)

224
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,364
Doc: Anybody hear that?

225
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,004
(distant banging)

226
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,840
Tank: Get to the side.

227
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,711
(distant banging)

228
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,946
Tank: Doc, get your light
down there.

229
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,316
(distant banging)

230
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,819
Tank: Lean back.
Back!

231
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,387
Tank: Doc, come here.

232
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,524
Doc: Why, why am I going
up there?

233
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,560
Tank: Shh! You handle a gun?

234
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,562
Doc: No.

235
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,832
Tank: It's easy.
Point. Shoot.

236
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,567
Tank: I need you in the front.

237
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,268
Doc: I lost my glasses.
I can't see anything.

238
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,703
Tank: Don't worry
about your glasses --

239
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,839
Doc: I need my glasses --
Tank: Just get up here, Doc!

240
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,711
Tank: I need you to stay
in the front,

241
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,879
and keep your gun
down the tunnel.

242
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,148
Doc: When you will you be back?
Tank: Look at me!

243
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,650
Tank: You keep your gun
down the tunnel,
and you keep quiet.

244
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,987
Tank: If you see anything,
you let me know, okay?

245
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,522
Doc: All right, yeah.

246
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,923
Tank: Move.
Package: Tank.

247
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,825
Tank: Shh. Move.

248
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,727
Doc: When are you, when are --
Tank: Move Doc!

249
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:22,066
Tank: Package,
I need you up here.
Come on move!

250
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,979
(Distant banging - louder)

251
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,992
Tank: Move!

252
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,966
(distant banging)

253
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,669
(distant hatch door creaking)

254
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,442
(distant banging - louder)

255
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,847
(bang)

256
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,886
Tank: Package, go.

257
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,989
Tank: Come on, go.

258
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,461
Tank: Wait! Be quiet!

259
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,908
Tank: Snoop!

260
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,681
Snoop: Hail! Hail!
Tank: Snoop!

261
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,363
Tank: Where's Snipe?

262
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,134
Snoop: He didn't make it.

263
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,004
Snoop: What are you doing
back here?

264
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,105
Tank: I got Doc up front.

265
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,007
Snoop: Doc?

266
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,210
I need you up there,
get your damn head
in the game!

267
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,778
You need to get up front now!

268
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,217
Snoop: Tank.

269
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,053
Snoop: She's the only thing
that matters now.

270
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,467
Tank: Get to the side!
Snoop: Let her through.

271
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:43,274
Snoop: Doc I need you to do
everything Tank tells you,
to the tee!

272
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:44,875
Snoop:Let me know
what you see.

273
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,113
Tank: All right, keep close.

274
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,456
Tank: Come on.

275
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,538
Tank: Wait, wait!
Hold up!

276
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,761
Snoop: (whispered)
What do you see, Tank?

277
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,943
Tank: (whispered) It's a room.

278
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,180
Snoop: Let's go.
Is it clear?

279
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,415
Tank: The tunnel
keeps going, but --

280
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:00,484
Tank: -- but there's
a room here.

281
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,996
Tank: It's clear, come on!
Get back here!

282
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,298
Snoop: Package, you follow!

283
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,200
Snoop: Let's go people, we
gotta move!

284
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,872
Tank: Can't see shit.

285
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,209
Snoop: Package, Doc,
opposite corners.

286
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,580
Doc: If we could stay
here a while,
it'd be good for her to rest.

287
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:30,614
She's gonna need --

288
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:33,317
Snoop: Five minutes,
then we move.

289
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,319
Doc: I know you're in charge.

290
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,722
Doc: I understand that,
and agree with that.

291
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:45,529
Doc: The human body can regain
almost all it needs --
30 minutes of sleep.

292
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,666
Doc: Thirty minutes,
she's as good as new.

293
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,803
Doc: Without it, in about
an hour we're dragging her.

294
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,444
Snoop: Can't afford to make
a mistake on this.

295
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:01,645
Snoop: What ever the hell
this thing is,

296
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:03,447
it's been ripping through
us like paper mache.

297
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:06,750
Tank: Snoop, she does
look pretty beat.
Package: I can go.

298
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,235
Snoop: Listen, you got
fifteen minutes.

299
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,838
Snoop: And that's it!
Doc: Thank you.

300
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,106
Snoop: Let's just hope you're
thanking me if --

301
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:33,077
(roaring, screeching
and gurgling)

302
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,453
Package: (screams)
(roaring, screeching continues)

303
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,622
Tank: Get in the tunnel!

304
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,894
Snoop: (screams)

305
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,635
Snoop: (distant) Tank...

306
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,073
Tank...

307
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,464
(growling, devouring sounds)

308
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,266
Snoop: (screams)

309
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,638
Doc: What was that?
What was that?!

310
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,344
Tank: Move!

311
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,524
Tank: What is your problem?

312
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,294
Package: He's -- he's not good
in tight spaces.

313
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,229
Tank: You're not good
in tight spaces?

314
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,597
Doc: I'm not.

315
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:41,405
Tank: You get your ass
down that tunnel
or I'm leaving you here!

316
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,607
Tank: Get the gun and move!

317
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,944
Tank: Get up here, get up here.

318
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,561
Tank: Doc, keep going.

319
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,197
Tank: Move!

320
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:14,404
Doc: Maybe we should stop?
Tank: Doc, if you don't move --

321
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,307
(overlapping arguments)

322
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,377
Tank: Let's go.
Go.

323
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,892
Doc: Stop! Stop!
Tank: (whispers) What?

324
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,560
Doc: There's something up here.

325
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,329
Tank: (whispers)
Get to the side.

326
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,309
Tank: Shh!

327
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,201
Tank: Come on.

328
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,183
(tunnel creaking)

329
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:34,718
(distant banging)

330
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,557
Tank: Do what you can,
but we're not staying long.

331
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,968
Tank: Calm down, I'll tell you
when I'm needing the bathroom.

332
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,005
Tank: Take these, rip 'em.
Wrap her hands and her knees.

333
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,406
Package: (coughing)

334
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,011
Tank: I got a plan.

335
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:16,026
Tank: Doc, get that gun.
I need you to cover the tunnel.

336
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,098
Tank: Package,
you stay down.

337
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,373
Doc: Where are you going?

338
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,842
(tunnel creaking)

339
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:14,351
(tunnel creaking)

340
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,765
(slow breathing)

341
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,985
Doc: I don't like this.

342
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,122
Tank: Ok, alright.

343
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,076
(loud metal clang)

344
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,046
Tank: (whispered) Ok, come on.

345
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,821
Tank: Come on.

346
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,417
Doc: This plan is not
about how we all three
are getting up there, is it?

347
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,654
Tank: If it moves over
those lights,
we're gonna see it.

348
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,758
Tank: And maybe if I can get
one shot into this thing
we can kill it.

349
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,927
Doc: Wait, we're waiting
for this thing?

350
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,298
Doc: Not once, not once
have we been able
to stop this thing.

351
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,467
Tank: Not once have
