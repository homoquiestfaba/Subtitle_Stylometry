1
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,443
(Thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,915
Iolaus: <i> You think you know</i>
<i>the truth about him?</i>

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,418
<i>You know nothing.</i>

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,320
(Lightning crashing)

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,892
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

6
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>King of the gods.</i>

7
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>His mother,
alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

8
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,238
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

9
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,174
<i>Half human,</i>

10
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,709
<i>half God.</i>

11
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:24,783
<i>But Zeus' queen, hera,</i>
<i>saw this bastard</i>
<i>child as an insult,</i>

12
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,854
<i>a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.</i>

13
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Alcmene named
the boy Hercules,</i>

14
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>which means "glory of hera,"</i>

15
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,763
<i>but this failed to
appease the goddess.</i>

16
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,766
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

17
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,669
(Hissing)

18
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,550
(Crushing)

19
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,384
(Gasps)

20
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:02,688
<i>Luckily,
he took after his father.</i>

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>Once he reached manhood,</i>

22
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,094
<i>the gods commanded him
to perform twelve labors,</i>

23
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,563
<i>twelve dangerous missions.</i>

24
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>If he completed
them all and survived,</i>

25
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,903
<i>hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

26
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,950
(Roaring)

27
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,191
<i>He fought the lernean hydra!</i>

28
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,832
(Roaring)

29
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,904
(Panting)

30
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:55,307
<i>He battled
the erymanthean boar!</i>

31
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,757
<i>But his greatest labor
was the nemean lion.</i>

32
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,692
(Lion growling)

33
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,565
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

34
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,633
(Roars)

35
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:26,038
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

36
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,106
(Roaring loudly)

37
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,721
<i>But even this</i>
<i>monster was no match</i>
<i>for the son of Zeus.</i>

38
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,693
What a load of crap!

39
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,461
Every word is true.

40
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,563
(Men laughing)

41
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,865
- (Iolaus whimpers)
- Gryza: You know what I think?

42
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,135
This friend of yours
doesn't even exist.

43
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,270
(Men continue laughing)

44
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:58,971
Iolaus: Laugh all you want.

45
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:04,042
He's coming.
And be warned, gryza,
he despises pirates.

46
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,111
Macedonia has been good to us.

47
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:09,481
Plenty of villages
ripe for pillaging.

48
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,049
We are here to stay.

49
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,584
Finish him.

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,820
(Gasping)

51
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:18,190
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

52
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:18,957
(Gryza chuckles)

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,427
Indeed, your fleet is strong.
I...

54
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:30,469
Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so
rudely interrupted,

55
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,105
the nemean lion
was strong, too.

56
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,840
Yet, he still destroyed it.

57
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:39,778
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

58
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,851
I did it with my bare hands!

59
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,489
Or so they say.

60
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,793
Hercules.

61
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,495
Is this all the men you have?

62
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:59,031
There's 40 of us. One of you.

63
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:03,969
The king of this land
has offered me gold
to dispose of you.

64
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,638
So leave, or die.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,807
I get paid either way.

66
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,877
Make him bleed.

67
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,679
(Men yelling)

68
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,118
Five men with a single blow.

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,455
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

70
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,691
Bring me his head!

71
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,125
(Men yelling)

72
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,629
Seems they need
more convincing, autolycus.

73
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,464
That's why we're here.

74
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,032
(Men scream)

75
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,868
- Atalanta.
- (Groans)

76
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,539
Amphiaraus.

77
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,343
May Zeus forgive you.

78
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,645
- Tydeus?
- (Yelling)

79
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,947
(All grunting)

80
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,384
(Men screaming)

81
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,435
Die, Hercules!

82
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,137
(Screaming stops)

83
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,510
Ah, good man. (Chuckles)

84
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,713
(Panting)

85
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,221
(Rope snapping)

86
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,455
Hurry!

87
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,190
Hurry! Uncle!

88
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,092
(Yelping)

89
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,394
Uncle, hurry!

90
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,329
Hurry! Hurry!

91
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,599
(Screams)

92
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,633
Any longer, Uncle...

93
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:45,771
And the girls
would finally be safe
from your attentions.

94
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,543
The rest of you may go.

95
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,012
But not you.

96
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,793
Thirteen,

97
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,896
14, 15, 16,

98
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:15,233
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

99
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,670
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

100
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,373
minus the headless ones.
Let's see.

101
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:21,807
Not a bad night.

102
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,710
You see how the pirates ran?
My story
softened their resolve.

103
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,313
Their resolve must
be broken, iolaus.

104
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,348
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

105
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,017
make it bigger, scarier.

106
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,287
The more they believe
Hercules is truly
the son of Zeus,

107
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,789
the less likely
they are to fight.

108
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,858
Oh!

109
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,594
Aye.

110
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
- Amphiaraus?
- Mmm?

111
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,532
Care to join us here on earth?

112
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,576
A lion and a crow in strange
alliance, fighting across
a sea of corpses.

113
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:07,319
If you're going
to use those herbs,
amphiaraus, at least share.

114
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,620
Huh?

115
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,355
(All chuckling)

116
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,058
- (Upbeat music playing)
- (Indistinct conversations)

117
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,296
Thug: Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

118
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,899
Fight it!

119
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,034
Keep practicing, boys!

120
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,338
- So who's next? You? You?
- (Sniffing)

121
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,639
Ah!

122
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,709
That's a pretty sight.

123
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,144
One more payday, autolycus,
that's all we need.

124
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,748
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

125
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,351
Or live simply.

126
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,587
You still dreaming
of barbarian lands?

127
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,757
Beyond the aegean.
At the shores
of the black sea.

128
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,061
That is where I will live out
the rest of my
days in solitude.

129
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,997
Boring, if you ask me.

130
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,564
Maybe so, autolycus.

131
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:57,636
But I'll never find peace
unless I move as far
away as possible.

132
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:58,970
What of tydeus?

133
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:03,041
Without you to
temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

134
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,442
Tydeus will go with me.

135
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:08,113
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

136
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,514
Uncle!

137
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,585
Join us.
The girls are
eager to welcome you.

138
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,629
See?
I told you I knew Hercules.

139
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,532
Are you his servant?

140
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm his nephew.

141
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:29,968
Are you, really?

142
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,336
I tell of
Hercules' twelve labors,

143
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,639
like the nemean lion,
the apples of the hesperides,

144
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,206
the belt of hippolyta

145
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,076
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

146
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,813
-I immortalize him...
-He talks,
while the rest of us fight.

147
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,417
It is a wonder
you share the same
blood as Hercules.

148
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,118
(Women laughing)

149
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,553
Have fun.

150
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,589
- Ladies.
- Both: Oh...

151
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,043
What do you
want with Hercules?

152
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,812
My words are for him, not you.

153
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,615
Atalanta, it's all right.

154
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,723
You certainly are
a hard man to find.

155
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,092
Maybe I don't want
anyone to find me.

156
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,593
I'm not just anyone.

157
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,429
My name is ergenia,
daughter to lord cotys.

158
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,433
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

159
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,270
My father is most unfortunate.

160
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:42,073
He battles a warlord, rhesus.

161
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,241
Our land is torn by civil war.

162
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,479
Every day, villages are
destroyed, crops ruined,
innocents slaughtered.

163
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,447
We all have problems.

164
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:55,387
Well, perhaps I can
convince you to make
our problems your own.

165
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:56,955
Unfortunately, my lady,

166
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,325
Hercules is fully committed
till the feast of dionysus.

167
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:00,992
We could, however,

168
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,130
advance you to
the front of the line,
for the right price.

169
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:05,897
Hmm.

170
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,699
I thought heroes
fight for glory.

171
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,868
But mercenaries
fight for gold.

172
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,836
Lord cotys is a rich man.

173
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,404
I like him already.

174
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:17,308
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your
weight in gold.

175
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,547
Eat up.

176
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,689
"A lion and crow in
strange alliance."

177
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,857
Told you.

178
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,265
Where are we going?

179
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,617
(Horse whinnies)

180
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,394
It is good to see
you safe, my lady.

181
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,535
This war claims
more victims every day.
We were concerned, my lady.

182
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:54,606
Thank you, general sitacles.
I was well protected.

183
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,640
Ah.

184
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,410
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

185
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,548
Though not quite
as big an honor
as I expected.

186
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,619
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

187
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,692
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

188
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,326
It's meant to be.

189
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,497
It took five years
and a thousand men
to build her temple.

190
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,499
Hera is the patron
goddess of thrace.

191
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,837
Everyone knows the legend,
how hera seeks to
destroy Hercules.

192
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,341
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

193
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,876
Mother!

194
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,511
Arius.

195
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,483
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

196
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,352
My name is arius.
I know all your
labors by heart.

197
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,122
You killed the giant geryon
with a single blow,

198
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,191
cleaned the augean stables
in one night.

199
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:46,891
Hercules is probably tired.

200
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,793
And the labor of the hide,
and the labor of the mares.

201
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,429
-That's enough, arius.
Come along.
-(Chuckles)

202
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,363
(Whispers) Stay away from him.

203
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,300
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

204
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:59,537
But he's Hercules.
He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

205
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,475
Lord cotys will see you now.

206
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,685
Have you ever met royalty,
Hercules?

207
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,654
Once or twice.

208
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,573
- Both: Father!
- Ah! (Chuckles)

209
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,675
(Applause)

210
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,279
Megara.

211
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,950
Welcome home, my love.

212
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,321
(All cheering)

213
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,958
Hercules!

214
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,999
Whenever I'm here,
I imagine this is what
elysium must look like.

215
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,867
(Chuckles) Well, men like us
have the means

216
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:06,704
to create our own
paradise on earth.

217
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,906
Look.

218
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,941
Magnificent, aren't they?

219
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:15,546
Well, do not keep us
in suspense. Are we safe
from the monster hydra?

220
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,385
The hydra's heads,
your majesty.

221
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,528
The masks of serpents.

222
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,598
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

223
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,068
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

224
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,237
Let the people
have their hero.

225
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:43,675
Male servant:
All hail king eurystheus.

226
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,844
And the mighty
protector of Athens,

227
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,747
- Hercules!
- (Crowd cheering)

228
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,850
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

229
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,556
A man faced with such
adoration might be tempted
to think himself a God.

230
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,061
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

231
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,101
(Both screaming)

232
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,270
Lord cotys awaits.

233
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,691
Hercules.

234
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,594
Welcome.

235
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,565
An honor to
host such a legend.

236
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,734
Lord cotys.

237
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,471
But in legend, you fight alone.

238
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:50,742
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

239
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,311
Autolycus of sparta.

240
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,415
Tydeus of thebes.

241
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,185
Atalanta of scythia.

242
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,288
Iolaus of Athens.

243
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,291
And amphiaraus of argos.

244
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,893
Amphiaraus?

245
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,797
The famed seer of argos.

246
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,199
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

247
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,871
so you fight each battle
knowing that it is not yet
your time to die.

248
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,273
What else can you
tell of the future?

249
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,777
Only what the gods
see fit to reveal.

250
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,344
A shame.

251
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,414
It would have been
a great gift to know
the outcome of this war.

252
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:33,851
The gods can be
frustrating sometimes,
lord cotys.

253
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,319
(Chuckles)

254
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:39,690
(Sighs)

255
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:45,430
With respect, I fear tha
t the task ahead might not be
suitable for a woman,

256
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,566
even if she is
an Amazon warrior.

257
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,208
I stand corrected.

258
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,243
(Indistinct conversations)

259
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,213
Cotys:
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

260
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:06,184
it was intended as
the high seat of all thrace.

261
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:09,153
But now thrace is divided.

262
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,388
This war has
depleted our forces.

263
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,559
We're left with nothing
but farmers and merchants
to replenish our army.

264
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,894
It takes every one of us
to resist rhesus.

265
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:21,265
People think that
he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

266
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,401
Only by a God.

267
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,636
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

268
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,973
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

269
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:33,811
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

270
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,547
Centaurs?

271
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,984
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

272
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,688
Cotys: Come, Hercules.

273
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,192
Let me show you what misery
rhesus has brought us.

274
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,799
Every week,
more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

275
00:18:54,801 --> 00:19:00,071
most of them covered
in blood, crippled or
burnt by rhesus' men.

276
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:05,309
I feared nothing could ever
be good again,
till you arrived.

277
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,312
I'm just
a mercenary fighting for gold.

278
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,750
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

279
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,720
How others
perceive us is important.

280
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,589
And your name, like it or not,

281
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:21,292
is a rallying cry.

282
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:31,135
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends,
and I am not alone.

283
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,071
Nobody has any faith anymore.

284
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:39,777
The people need a hero.
They need
someone to look up to.

285
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,148
My son believes in you.

286
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,584
Bring us peace,

287
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,755
and I will
believe in you, too.

288
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm convinced
these are good people.

289
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,734
I see.
And who's more convincing,
cotys or his daughter?

290
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:07,672
All the gold on earth is not
as convincing as
a pair of breasts.

291
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,407
Maybe, but gold never ages.

292
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,076
Which is why
I got them to
double our price.

293
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,980
Double your weight in gold?
(Laughs) Well done.

294
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:16,847
Amphiaraus?

295
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:17,949
If it be the will of Zeus.

296
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,951
Which title
sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

297
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:24,322
"Hercules: Savior of thrace"
or "Hercules:
A legend is born"?

298
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,724
Both sound
terrifyingly boring.

299
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:27,391
(Chuckles)

300
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,828
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

301
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,565
Train them.

302
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,535
- Oh, shit.
- (Chuckles)

303
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:47,511
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

304
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,913
Surviving.

305
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,784
My companions
and I will show you
how to stay alive,

306
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:58,155
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

307
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,959
Autolycus.

308
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,695
Shield wall! Form!

309
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,906
(Yelling)

310
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,708
(Men groaning)

311
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,280
(Panting)

312
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,849
Corpses!
Every last one of you!

313
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:28,085
Because your
shield wall was weak.

314
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,587
Dead.

315
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,389
Dead.

316
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,190
Very dead.

317
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,193
Soldier,

318
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,329
many lives depend on you.

319
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,766
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

320
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,770
You understand?

321
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,238
Yes, sir.

322
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,774
When a shield wall is strong,

323
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:52,677
nothing can ever defeat it!

324
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,913
You must learn
to work together,
react together.

325
00:21:55,915 --> 00:22:00,217
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

326
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,354
that will be
stronger than iron.

327
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,994
I hope the enemy
has a sense of humor.

328
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:15,199
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

329
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:20,905
It is imperative that
we strike now, my lord,
given this opportunity.

330
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,540
Cotys: Ah! There you are!

331
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:27,478
Hercules,
my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

332
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,647
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

333
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,617
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

334
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,186
Demons march with them.

335
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,854
So now we're fighting demons.

336
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:40,257
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

337
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:44,128
My lord, rhesus is preparing
to attack bessi lands.

338
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,930
He will be on
them within six days.

339
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,100
If the bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

340
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:53,137
Your men need weeks,
if not months, of training
before they're ready.

341
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,540
The bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

342
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,211
If we do not protect them,
then there will
be a bloodbath.

343
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,746
Face rhesus with
an untrained army

344
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,781
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

345
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:08,953
My lord, rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

346
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,721
The longer rhesus lives,

347
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:16,660
the more villages will
be burnt and the more
innocents will be killed.

348
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,698
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

349
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:26,804
Hercules,
the gods have
offered us a gift.

350
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,606
We must not squander it.

351
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,776
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

352
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,411
No.

353
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,247
The son of Zeus will.

354
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,455
(Indistinct conversations)

355
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,998
I've seen how you
watch over Hercules.

356
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,402
Tell me,

357
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,205
how did a woman,

358
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,574
beautiful woman,

359
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,278
fall in with
these hardened men?

360
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,679
Killers?

361
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,686
Son of Zeus need
a woman's protection?

362
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,988
I don't protect him.

363
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,559
I protect you from him.

364
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,395
Hmm.

365
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:48,586
General, from now on,
maybe you should favor
the company of your men.

366
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,661
He pulled a knife?

367
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,731
It was only a small prick.

368
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,366
(Chuckles)

369
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,203
(Indistinct conversations)

370
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,910
(Faint growling)

371
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,145
(Whimpering)

372
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,553
(Snarling)

373
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,535
- Ah!
- (Screaming)

374
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,005
(Panting)

375
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,041
Your mother told
you to stay away.
You should listen.

376
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,410
What's wrong with him?

377
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,349
Tydeus is my
most loyal warrior.

378
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,785
He was born in war.

379
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:59,623
When I found him,
he was more animal than human.

380
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,563
He never speaks
of what he saw.

381
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,165
He never speaks at all.

382
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,835
But he relives it every night.

383
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,405
Come.

384
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,307
Let's find your mother.

385
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,182
Arius: When I grow up,
I want to be
a great hero like you.

386
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,786
-Hercules: Like me?
-No hero is
greater than Hercules.

387
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:29,353
I know all your labors.

388
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:33,824
Like the cretan bull,
you wrestled it for seven days
and seven nights.

389
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:34,525
Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

390
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:38,362
-And struck it 49
times with your club.
-Maybe not quite that many.

391
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:43,133
Until it fell dead
and crete was saved.
It's my favorite labor.

392
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,535
Also queen hippolyta's belt,

393
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:48,772
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

394
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,643
-Do you even know
what that means?
-No.

395
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,546
(Laughs)

396
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,716
(Man coughs)

397
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,088
- Mother.
- Arius.

398
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,857
You're supposed to be in bed.

399
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,361
Why are you in the hospice?

400
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,930
My mother saves
people's lives.

401
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,732
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

402
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:19,236
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself
the art of healing.

403
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,005
If I could be like you,

404
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:25,175
I would protect all of thrace
and no one
would ever get hurt.

405
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,844
(Chuckles)

406
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,387
Hercules: Here.

407
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,557
I was going to give this
to someone else,

408
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,028
but I never got the chance.

409
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,264
Only a hero may wear this.

410
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,801
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

411
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,706
Is this
the nemean lion's tooth?

412
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,509
- It is.
- Thank you.

413
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,411
Thank you.

414
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,779
Good night.

415
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,281
Good night, Hercules.

416
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,553
Amphiaraus: Have no fear.

417
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:15,159
If you fall in
the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to elysium,

418
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:20,264
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

419
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,732
like theseus.

420
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:22,866
Odysseus!

421
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,001
And the great achilles.

422
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:29,373
Or if you're lucky,
you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

423
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,182
Iolaus.

424
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,850
Your place is
beside lord cotys,
where it's safe.

425
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:43,821
I've been giving it a lot
of thought, and I really feel
I'm ready to fight.

426
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:45,723
You're a storyteller,
not a warrior.

427
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,657
We share the same blood.

428
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,827
And I will not see it shed.
Chariot.

429
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,161
Now.

430
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,763
(Scoffs)

431
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,237
Thracians,

432
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,874
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

433
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:07,878
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

434
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,515
When you fight,
the wall is your armor.

435
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,817
The shield wall will
never break formation

436
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:17,588
as long as there is
breath in your body.

437
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,290
Remember these words,

438
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,293
and you will taste victory.

439
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,730
- Move the army out!
- Soldier 1: Move out!

440
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,313
(Horses neighing)

441
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,833
Halt!

442
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,100
Halt!

443
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,970
- Halt!
- Soldier 2: Halt!

444
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,836
We are too late.

445
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:16,106
Rhesus has already been here.

446
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,880
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

447
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,411
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

448
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,482
I hate being
right all the time.

449
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,454
Halt.

450
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,723
- Halt!
- Soldier 1: Halt!

451
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,069
Hercules:
This head is rotting.

452
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,739
A week old, at least.

453
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,478
Yet some of these
bodies are fresh.

454
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,960
- (Yells)
- (Yelping)

455
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,728
- Iolaus: Uncle!
- (Both grunting)

456
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,334
(Shrieks)

457
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,940
And we've walked into a trap.

458
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:07,250
Shield wall! Form a single
square! Protect lord cotys!
Iolaus, go!

459
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:09,286
Shield wall!

460
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,031
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

461
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:21,999
This is rhesus' doing.

462
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,002
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

463
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,271
Turn comrades
against each other.

464
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,515
King's guards,
around lord cotys!

465
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,526
Amphiaraus,
do we die in this battle?

466
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:54,231
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

467
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,834
That's comforting.

468
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,371
(Yelling)

469
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,444
I think he wants a challenge.

470
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,280
(All cheering)

471
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,901
Hercules' fists
have been dipped
in the blood of the hydra!

472
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,537
Lethal to anyone but him!

473
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,441
Watch!

474
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,513
(Yelling)

475
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,252
(Cheering stops)

476
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,420
Did you see that?

477
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,389
The gods fight on our side!

478
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,558
(All cheering)

479
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,260
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

480
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,630
All: (Chanting)
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

481
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,299
Hercules! Hercules!

482
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,669
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

483
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:07,904
(Yelling)

484
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,173
(All yelling)

485
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,418
Battle position!

486
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,830
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

487
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,266
(Yelling continues)

488
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,673
(All grunting)

489
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,166
Stand fast!

490
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,383
Sitacles: Hold your position!

491
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,600
Do not yield!

492
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,442
(Shouts)

493
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,926
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

494
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,795
Hold the lines!

495
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,097
Do not yield!

496
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,200
Defend lord cotys!

497
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,173
(Screams)

498
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,561
Sitacles:
The wall has been breached!

499
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:25,935
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend lord cotys!

500
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,410
Whip!

501
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,322
Hercules!

502
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,290
Bring the chariots!

503
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,900
Sitacles: Defend your lord!

504
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,946
No!

505
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,619
(Urges horses)

506
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,869
(Laughs)

507
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,928
(Yelling)

508
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,132
(Grunts)

509
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,307
(Grunts)

510
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,956
Advance!

511
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,892
Sitacles: Advance!

512
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,563
(Groans)

513
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,235
(Soldiers cheering)

514
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,311
Soldier: Make way!

515
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,292
Where is rhesus?

516
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,571
(Indistinct conversations)

517
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,681
Lord cotys.

518
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,017
We came here to
save this village,

519
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,621
but, no, they killed
half my army.

520
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,957
Rhesus.

521
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,059
This is all his doing.

522
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,560
And yours.

523
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,094
I warned you.

524
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,598
Your men are brave,
but untrained,
unprepared for battle.

525
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,634
Give me time to make warriors.

526
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,838
Very well.

527
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:57,347
Cover up,
before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

528
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,157
Phineas.

529
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,226
You plead your life.

530
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,595
And I gladly offer it.

531
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,832
I failed to see this trap.

532
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,934
The fault is mine!
Spare the other scouts.

533
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,969
Autolycus: General sitacles.

534
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,840
I think we've lost enough men
for the day, don't you?

535
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,808
But just to avoid
future misunderstandings,

536
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,280
I'll be taking charge
of your scouts from now on.

537
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,248
Is that clear?

538
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,888
Thank you.

539
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,392
Another mistake,
I'll end you myself.

540
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,441
(Indistinct conversations)

541
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,076
(Horse whinnies)

542
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:16,759
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and Clay
to seal the wound.

543
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:20,730
This is extract of
lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

544
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:25,401
It should rest you after
consuming it. It may have
certain side effects.

545
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,736
I don't need it.

546
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,173
Ah, forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

547
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:35,445
And, uh, your lion's hide
is indestructible?

548
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,248
Drink, son of Zeus.

549
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:45,788
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

550
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,156
Where is he now?

551
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:51,127
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

552
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,595
I'm sorry.

553
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,897
I never knew my father.

554
00:43:55,499 --> 00:44:00,370
Well, he must have been
very, very strong. (Laughs)

555
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,440
Tell me about arius.

556
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,176
Oh. He's a good boy.

557
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,680
And someday,
he will make a fine king.

558
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,382
Do you have any children?

559
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,787
Do they live in Athens?

560
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,256
Thank you for your care.

561
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,669
The sedative
will help you rest.

562
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,937
How could you do
such a terrible thing?

563
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:08,871
By law, I should execute you,

564
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,942
but I believe
a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live.

565
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:16,612
So you can walk
the earth in torment,
haunted by the knowledge

566
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:21,884
that you alone are responsible
for the death of
your loved ones.

567
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,354
The great Hercules.

568
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:30,526
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

569
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,663
Get out, you monster.

570
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:34,697
Get out!

571
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,265
(Panting)

572
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,204
(Children laughing)

573
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:56,018
(Laughing continues)

574
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,267
(Growling)

575
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,805
No!

576
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,374
(Snarling)

577
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,647
(Yelling)

578
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,456
(Panting)

579
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:31,314
Amphiaraus: It happened
again, didn't it, hmm?

580
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:35,351
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed
beast of Hades?

581
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,222
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

582
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:42,758
There's a word for that.
Madness.

583
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,727
When we were
driven from Athens,

584
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,663
I consulted
the oracle of delphi
on your behalf.

585
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:49,532
Do you remember her prophecy?

586
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:53,970
"Hercules must
finish the labor
that remains unfinished."

587
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:56,138
And what is that, Hercules?

588
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,910
Confront
the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

589
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:01,477
I speak from experience.

590
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:06,549
No matter how far you run,
no matter how fast you go,
the beast will follow.

591
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,986
Man cannot escape his fate.

592
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,336
Room for one more
in your company?

593
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:31,641
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship
for a change.

594
00:48:31,643 --> 00:48:34,577
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

595
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,847
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

596
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,616
Both can satisfy
in different ways.

597
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,890
You're a famed
storyteller, iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

598
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:50,793
Any particular subject,
my lady?

599
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,830
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

600
00:48:56,366 --> 00:49:00,036
Is it true? Did Hercules
slaughter his own family?

601
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:03,039
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

602
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,841
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

603
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,611
king eurystheus
will have him executed.

604
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,419
Hercules had
completed his labors
and returned home. But hera...

605
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,322
No myths. I want the truth.

606
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,490
No one knows the truth.

607
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,192
Not for sure.

608
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:29,031
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, megara and
the children, dead.

609
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,833
He remembers nothing.

610
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,668
Do you believe he is innocent?

611
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,441
We grew up together, both
orphans, trying to survive in
the streets of Athens.

612
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:43,179
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

613
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,483
Hercules'
strength set him apart.

614
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:51,620
Kings of Athens started to
send him on all the most
dangerous missions.

615
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,089
The twelve labors.

616
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,191
And he took me with him.

617
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,659
To fight by his side.

618
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,628
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

619
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,266
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom
where the royal family
had been assassinated.

620
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:07,203
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

621
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:10,272
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

622
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,541
He became my brother-in-arms.

623
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,112
Thebes, the city of corpses,

624
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,647
where we found a single child,

625
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,883
still alive.

626
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,518
Hercules took tydeus in when

627
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,255
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

628
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,126
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

629
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,927
Hercules' deeds
were so incredible,

630
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:36,499
they could not possibly
have been
performed by a mere mortal.

631
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,767
So we played along.

632
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:43,406
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus.
It's good.

633
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:45,207
Scares the enemy.

634
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,343
Iolaus helps.

635
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:48,844
He talks nice.

636
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,748
You're very loyal friends.

637
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,683
You're avoiding my question.

638
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,119
Hercules is a warrior.

639
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:59,255
And there is something
that haunts warriors.

640
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,856
It can cloud their minds.

641
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:04,360
We call it the blood rage.

642
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,129
This rage afflicted Hercules.

643
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,632
He made me vow to keep
the world away from him.

644
00:51:09,634 --> 00:51:13,135
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

645
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,705
And that,
my lady, is the truth.

646
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,574
The truth,

647
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,809
(scoffs)

648
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,344
Whatever the truth,

649
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:25,314
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

650
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,284
Only the gods can help him,

651
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,153
if he listens.

652
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,362
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of thrace,
and behold,

653
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:44,266
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

654
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,168
Zeus' master ironsmith,

655
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,003
using the forges
of your own citadel,

656
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:53,275
has crafted
these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

657
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,978
As steel is hewn into shields,

658
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,982
so, too, will you be
hewn into warriors.

659
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,955
You shall carry
the shield of Hercules!

660
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,763
It's lighter.

661
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:18,067
Infused with the souls
of stymphalian birds

662
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,568
from Hercules' sixth labor!

663
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:23,939
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

664
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,208
Well, much as
birds take flight,

665
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:31,480
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air.
It's in the fibers. Here.

666
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,950
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

667
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:41,924
It covers my whole face.

668
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:46,662
Forged after Hercules' very
own helmet, when he
defeated the demon geryon.

669
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:51,634
You sure it wasn't your
horseshit that frightened
geryon to death?

670
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:52,835
Mmm?

671
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:53,969
Iolaus: General sitacles,

672
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:58,340
perhaps you
would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

673
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,418
(Chuckles)

674
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,691
Leather armor?

675
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,159
Mmm?

676
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,495
We will be skewered like pigs.

677
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:22,264
- (Sitacles grunts)
- (Soldiers gasp)

678
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,100
Linothorax.

679
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,138
Hewn from the skin of
the erymanthean boar.

680
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,440
It's indestructible.

681
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:37,213
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules
cut it off the boar?

682
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:42,384
He used
an indestructible blade.
(Scoffs)

683
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,153
(Soldiers murmuring)

684
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:04,139
Soldiers: One, two. (Grunt)

685
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,579
(Soldier grunts)

686
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,349
Hercules: Get up.

687
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,684
Next!

688
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,187
(Soldiers grunting)

689
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,027
Again!

690
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,795
Both eyes open.

691
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,132
Keep practicing.

692
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,301
(Groans)

693
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,136
Hercules: Firmer grip.

694
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:36,105
Elbow up.

695
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,374
Good.

696
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:40,442
Shield wall! Form!

697
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,449
- Atalanta: Stand tall.
- (Soldier grunts)

698
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,553
Excellent.

699
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,356
(Soldiers applauding)

700
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,625
(All grunting)

701
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,637
(Iolaus grunting)

702
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,149
Careful you don't
cut yourself, boy.

703
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,218
Autolycus: Again!

704
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,456
(Soldiers grunting)

705
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,960
Rhesus is here.

706
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:35,331
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

707
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:35,898
What did you see?

708
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,035
Centaurs.
Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

709
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:41,937
He saw shadows in the night.

710
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,873
My lord, I will go ahead
into the rhesus camp.

711
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,077
I will bring
word of his plans.

712
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:55,417
If we let them get
past mount asticus,
thrace will fall.

713
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,719
You want to stop rhesus?

714
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:58,954
We'll go through the forest
and they'll
never see us coming.

715
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,925
It'll slow down our chariots.
A gamble.

716
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,927
I have a plan.

717
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,065
The scouts have returned.

718
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:14,236
Rhesus has made his camp
in mount asticus,
72 leagues away.

719
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:17,373
Once these men
are ready, we march.

720
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,377
So, have you seen
if we win or lose?

721
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:25,381
The gods have been
annoyingly silent
on that matter.

722
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,181
What they have told me is that

723
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:30,386
I'm soon to discover
there truly is
a heaven or a hell.

724
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,654
When will you die?

725
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:36,525
Within a week in a place
that looks
an awful lot like hell.

726
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:40,696
As always,
the gods are
generous with hints,

727
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:43,265
but cheap on specifics.

728
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,735
Cheer up, Hercules.

729
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:51,640
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

730
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:55,878
I'm ready for what's next.

731
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,219
Thracians, halt!

732
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,320
(Soldiers grunt)

733
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:08,023
Shield wall! Form!

734
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,429
Battle positions!

735
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,300
Tydeus?

736
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,872
(Yelling)

737
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,041
(Soldiers grunt)

738
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,814
There is no enemy camp.

739
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,750
This is the right place.

740
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,769
Centaurs!

741
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,838
They're real.

742
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,643
(Blowing horn)

743
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,490
(Centaurs shouting)

744
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,364
It seems that we're expected.

745
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:12,314
Centaurs?

746
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:28,630
(Exhales)

747
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:33,302
Rhesus!

748
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:38,874
You have come
looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

749
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,578
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

750
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,813
Your legend ends here.

751
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,348
Hercules: Look at me.

752
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,817
Do I look afraid?

753
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,660
Phineas.

754
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,096
Traitor!

755
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,231
Hades will have you!

756
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,901
After it has you, my lord.

757
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,102
Rhesus: It is over, cotys.

758
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:11,406
Mount asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

759
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:14,109
And my troops
outman you three to one.

760
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:18,880
Surrender now,
and we shall
consider being merciful.

761
01:00:18,882 --> 01:00:22,484
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

762
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,525
You've made your choice.

763
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,242
Go!

764
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:01,890
In this moment, on this day,

765
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,427
become the man
you were born to be!

766
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:10,899
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

767
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:15,337
Let it be to death or victory!

768
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,706
(Soldiers cheering)

769
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,043
Charge!

770
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,952
Hercules: Shield wall!

771
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,421
(Soldiers grunt)

772
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:33,889
Flanks out!

773
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,162
(Soldiers yelling)

774
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,599
Maybe today.

775
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,355
Now!

776
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,226
(Soldiers groaning)

777
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,610
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

778
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:30,445
Silence, boy!

779
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,852
Spears forward!

780
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,220
(Soldiers grunt)

781
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,899
(Urges horses)

782
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,472
Archers, ready!

783
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,142
Loose!

784
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,524
(Both scream)

785
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:52,828
Advance!

786
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,605
Set them aflame!

787
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,778
Take cover!

788
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,447
Sitacles: Defend lord cotys!

789
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,201
Maybe not.

790
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,370
Shield wall! Attack!

791
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,475
Push forward!

792
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,092
To kill a snake,
cut off its head.

793
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,834
(Urging horse)

794
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:12,941
(Soldiers cheering)

795
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:16,077
Victory is yours, lord cotys!

796
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,713
It is not over yet!

797
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,992
(Urges horse)

798
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,446
(Horse neighing)

799
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:52,414
(Panting)

800
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:54,416
Fucking centaurs.

801
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,251
(Panting)

802
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,421
(All cheering)

803
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:04,025
All: (Chanting)
Hail, lord cotys!
Hail, lord cotys!

804
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:08,530
Hail, lord cotys!
Hail, lord cotys!

805
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,166
Hail, lord cotys!

806
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,702
(Soldiers booing)

807
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,995
Sitacles: Halt!

808
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,735
(Soldiers laugh)

809
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:48,303
Get up.

810
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,772
Get up.

811
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:57,645
(Soldiers laugh)

812
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,314
- Up.
- Enough!

813
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,460
You helped
a tyrant enslave a nation.

814
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,663
All I did was stop you
from burning more villages.

815
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:17,599
I burned no villages.

816
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:18,900
Hercules: Then who did?

817
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,769
Ask yourself,
if cotys is beloved,

818
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:23,638
why did he need
to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

819
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,306
Keep moving, dog.

820
01:07:25,308 --> 01:07:28,943
You've been
fighting on the wrong side.

821
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,722
- (Music playing)
- (Men laughing)

822
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,411
Where are you going?

823
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,247
I'm taking some
water to the prisoner.

824
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,717
Sit down.

825
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,791
It's time.

826
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,031
(Music stops)

827
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:29,904
Thrace is finally united.

828
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,475
One land,

829
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,643
one king,

830
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,813
one thrace.

831
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,015
All: One land!

832
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:42,784
One king! One thrace!

833
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,654
Thrace is not a man,
a king, or a God!

834
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,323
Thrace is her people!

835
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,825
- (Groans)
- (All laughing)

836
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,999
Who cares what rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

837
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,301
Let's collect our
fee and be gone.

838
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,715
Don't do anything foolish.

839
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,286
Where are you going?

840
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,425
(Gasps)

841
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,928
I saw pity in
your eyes for rhesus.

842
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:28,630
Why?

843
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,198
Look at me.

844
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,901
Cotys is responsible
for this war, isn't he?

845
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:40,508
You lie very well. Clearly,
your father's daughter.

846
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,879
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

847
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:49,551
If I disobeyed cotys or
resisted in any way,
arius would be executed.

848
01:09:49,553 --> 01:09:54,055
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

849
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,958
My husband was king.

850
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,028
And cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

851
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,897
Rhesus fought back.
Civil war broke out.

852
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:06,234
Arius is the legitimate king.

853
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,437
My father is old.

854
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,174
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

855
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:16,744
my son will be a good king.

856
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,681
And he will heal this land.

857
01:10:19,683 --> 01:10:21,316
That's a dream.

858
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,751
And you can help.

859
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:27,322
Please, when you leave thrace,
take arius with you.

860
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:29,524
Please keep him safe.

861
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,060
Find another savior.

862
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:33,661
Sitacles: Hercules?

863
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,799
The king
commands your presence.

864
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:44,572
My lady.

865
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,385
Ah, champion of thrace!

866
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:00,154
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

867
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,925
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

868
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,264
You wanted conquerors,
not heroes.

869
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,399
You betrayed me, cotys.

870
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,268
Betrayed?

871
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:17,438
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

872
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,642
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

873
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,244
Let's not
quibble about details.

874
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:31,753
We all know your legend,
Hercules.
But here is mine.

875
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:34,322
When I was a general
in the army of thrace,

876
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:37,425
I had dreams of
ruling this kingdom.

877
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:40,795
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

878
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:43,431
I now crave an empire.

879
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:48,736
My thousands will
train more thousands,
and they even more.

880
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,872
The lessons of
Hercules will spread.

881
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,574
What you began here
can never be stopped.

882
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:58,579
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

883
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,182
then lead it.

884
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,356
You want me to serve you?

885
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:11,893
Spare me the moral outrage.

886
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,928
Child killer.

887
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,030
(All gasp)

888
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,867
Getting us all killed,
bad idea.

889
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:27,275
Well,
I must take this as a "no."

890
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,610
In that case,

891
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,648
your services are
no longer required.

892
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:40,688
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

893
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:26,100
If we hurry,
we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

894
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,872
Take mine, too.

895
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,144
What do you
think you're doing?
Let's go.

896
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:38,346
There will be no
more innocent blood
on my hands.

897
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:41,816
I can't leave
without setting this right.

898
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:43,751
Oh, I see.

899
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:48,089
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

900
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:49,023
Thrace needs our help.

901
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,726
To hell with thrace.
We have gold.

902
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,060
You remember the black sea.

903
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:57,999
That beach you spoke
of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

904
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,403
I would never be free.

905
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,475
In this fight, you're alone.

906
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,212
Never saw that one coming.

907
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,915
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

908
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,550
- Why not?
- It's all right.

909
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:19,654
You've sacrificed
your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

910
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:22,690
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

911
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,425
Debt?

912
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,696
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

913
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,165
Look around, Hercules.

914
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,634
We're family.

915
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,070
All we have is each other.

916
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:40,975
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time,
we will die for you.

917
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,344
Because you would die for us.

918
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:48,216
Take that, too.
I have no need of it.

919
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:49,951
This is madness.

920
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,052
You want madness?

921
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:55,323
Tonight, a spear of flame
will Pierce my heart.

922
01:14:55,924 --> 01:15:00,061
Is that not
the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

923
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:13,341
Crazy. The lot of you.

924
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,042
Autolycus.

925
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:18,679
Iolaus. Go with autolycus.

926
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,615
I think I'll stay.

927
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:20,915
Nephew.

928
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:26,787
Uncle, all I've ever done is
tell stories of great deeds
performed by others.

929
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:32,293
It's time I stopped
telling their stories.
Started living my own.

930
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:37,064
Well, you may have all
completely lost
your minds, but not me.

931
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,901
Not me.

932
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:44,305
Autolycus?

933
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,911
Live like a king, my friend.

934
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:55,683
- (Urges horses)
- (Horses neighing)

935
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:01,222
What about cotys?

936
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,060
He paid us to save thrace.

937
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,895
Let's not disappoint him.

938
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,800
(Creaking)

939
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,026
Sitacles: Lay down your arms.

940
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,496
Lay down your arms!

941
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,133
Or your nephew dies first.

942
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,172
(Weapons clattering)

943
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:05,553
I invite you to join me.
You refuse.

944
01:17:05,555 --> 01:17:08,522
I order you to leave.
You return.

945
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:11,959
(Grunts) Get
your hands off me.

946
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:16,063
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

947
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:20,334
They were planning to remove
the young prince
from your protection.

948
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,041
- No.
- (Arius screaming)

949
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:29,910
Let go of him!
Don't touch him!

950
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,145
(Shouts)

951
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,316
Arius! No!

952
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,053
(Screaming)

953
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:41,022
No! You're hurting him! No!

954
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,624
Arius: Hercules, no!
Help me! Stop!

955
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:46,761
- Help! No!
- Ergenia: Arius. No.

956
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:49,063
(Crying) Arius! No!

957
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:52,833
(Groaning)

958
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:11,252
(Panting)

959
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,562
(Growling)

960
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,336
(Snarling)

961
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,646
Man: Magnificent, aren't they?

962
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:43,851
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

963
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,554
As long as they're fed.

964
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,390
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

965
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,927
They remember you.

966
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,030
Confused, Hercules?

967
01:18:56,032 --> 01:19:01,802
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are
made by alliances.

968
01:19:01,804 --> 01:19:07,808
King eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

969
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,579
(Snarling)

970
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:17,718
Cerberus only
exists in my mind.

971
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,322
Speak a little louder,
Hercules.

972
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,825
I didn't quite catch that.

973
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,329
The wolves.

974
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,900
They were there that night.

975
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,202
<i>The wolves were there.</i>

976
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,304
<i>You drugged me.</i>

977
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,417
(Megara screaming)

978
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,657
<i>The wolves were there</i>
<i>the night my</i>
<i>family was murdered.</i>

979
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:03,164
My men told me
how your children screamed

980
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,901
as my wolves
gnawed on their bones.

981
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:08,169
(Gasps)

982
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:12,339
As their fangs
despoiled your daughter's

983
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,241
pure flesh.

984
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:18,445
When the people
called out your name
louder than mine,

985
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:21,782
you see,
when they saw you as a God,

986
01:20:21,784 --> 01:20:24,518
how long before
they saw you as their king?

987
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,452
I wanted nothing!

988
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:29,023
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

989
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:32,159
I can deal with
an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

990
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,830
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

991
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,634
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

992
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,803
I had to ruin your name.

993
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,309
My wife!

994
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,010
My children!

995
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,047
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

996
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:58,419
All of you!
Starting with my
faithless daughter!

997
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:01,155
Ergenia: No! Get off me!

998
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,891
(Grunts) No! No! No!

999
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:06,360
Unhand me! No!

1000
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,862
She's your own
flesh and blood!

1001
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,164
I will raise arius to be
my worthy successor!

1002
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:15,369
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

1003
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:18,772
-You are a monster!
You are a monster!
-No!

1004
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,575
- (Grunts)
- Ergenia: You are not a man!

1005
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:23,377
You're a demon!

1006
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,379
Amphiaraus: Who are you?

1007
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,814
Are you a murderer?

1008
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:29,016
Damn you! I curse you!

1009
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:32,152
Are you a mercenary
who turns his
back on the innocent?

1010
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:33,587
Stay away from my son!

1011
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:35,222
Amphiaraus:
Are you only the legend?

1012
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,726
Or are you
the truth behind the legend?

1013
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:40,694
No! Father,
please, please, please.

1014
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,663
- We believe in you.
- (Ergenia sobbing)

1015
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,199
We have faith in you.

1016
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:46,967
Have faith in yourself.

1017
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,035
- (Grunts)
- Ergenia: Save me!

1018
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,470
Amphiaraus: Remember the man
that you are.

1019
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:53,474
Father,
the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

1020
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,943
Amphiaraus: Remember the deeds
you have performed,

1021
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:57,978
the labors you
have accomplished!

1022
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:00,314
No! No!

1023
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:02,082
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

1024
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,551
Amphiaraus: Now, tell me!

1025
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:05,553
Please!

1026
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:08,255
Who are you?

1027
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:12,660
I am Hercules!

1028
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,567
(Gasps)

1029
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:25,339
Unleash the wolves!

1030
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:29,376
(Wolves snarling)

1031
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,711
Hercules: Get away!

1032
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:32,379
Ahh!

1033
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,656
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

1034
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:45,826
- (Wolf whines)
- Ahh!

1035
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:47,394
Hurry!

1036
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,633
(Grunting)

1037
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,902
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

1038
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:58,572
No!

1039
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,248
(Grunting)

1040
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,650
(Jaw cracking)

1041
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,685
Ahh!

1042
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,360
(Wolf whines)

1043
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,668
The gods have
revealed your innocence.

1044
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,637
The final labor is complete.

1045
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,007
But I'm just getting started.

1046
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,283
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting
for us up there.

1047
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:53,494
(All grunting)

1048
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,700
(Soldier screams)

1049
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,148
My time.

1050
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,358
(Soldier screams)

1051
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:27,761
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

1052
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,630
You're welcome.

1053
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,433
(Screams)

1054
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,545
I'm going after eurystheus!

1055
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,261
(Grunting)

1056
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,368
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

1057
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,604
You see,
cotys poisoned my mind.

1058
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,507
Turned me against you.
(Laughs nervously)

1059
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:14,908
I like you.

1060
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,509
No, stop.

1061
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,646
I command you to stop!
I'm your king!
You took an oath to obey me!

1062
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:21,982
You swore to Zeus!

1063
01:25:21,984 --> 01:25:23,517
Wait, wait, wait.

1064
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:27,921
You fight for gold.
I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

1065
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:31,058
Find it in your
heart to forgive.

1066
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,398
You want forgiveness?

1067
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,001
(Grunts)

1068
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,479
(Groans)

1069
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,850
Ask my family for forgiveness.

1070
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,022
(Grunts)

1071
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,326
(Grunting)

1072
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:17,604
I've never
killed a God before.

1073
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:22,843
(Groans)

1074
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,716
I really think I'm
ready to fight now.

1075
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:35,389
Well done, warrior.

1076
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,093
(Men shouting)

1077
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:48,569
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

1078
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:51,605
- We need to find arius.
- Hercules: Follow me.

1079
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,387
Hercules: Soldiers of thrace!

1080
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:11,892
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

1081
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,427
Don't be fools!

1082
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:17,097
Hercules is mortal! Not a God!

1083
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:21,735
Anyone who sides
with him will die!

1084
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,905
And I will show you.

1085
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,640
Bring him.

1086
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:32,045
- Arius!
- Mama!

1087
01:27:32,047 --> 01:27:34,648
No! He's your grandson!

1088
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,484
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

1089
01:27:37,486 --> 01:27:39,953
- But you may yet save him.
- (Whimpers)

1090
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:41,555
Please, father! No!

1091
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,657
Admit defeat!

1092
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:45,659
Bow to me!

1093
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,796
You have until
the count of three!

1094
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:54,001
One!

1095
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:55,469
Two!

1096
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:58,005
- (Groans)
- (Soldiers murmuring)

1097
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,874
Don't just stand there!
Kill someone!

1098
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,944
Soldier: Protect lord cotys!

1099
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,382
Arius, run!

1100
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:09,683
Mother!

1101
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,019
Get the boy!

1102
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,957
(Screaming)

1103
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:28,201
(Tydeus yelling)

1104
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:31,071
(Groans)

1105
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:38,879
(Continues yelling)

1106
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,828
Ahh!

1107
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,207
Tydeus!

1108
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,346
- Attack!
- (Soldiers yelling)

1109
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,247
Hercules: Hold them back!

1110
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:31,631
Cotys: Spears!

1111
01:29:34,702 --> 01:29:36,636
(Both groaning)

1112
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:38,472
Go through the fire!

1113
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,974
(Soldiers yelling)

1114
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,180
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

1115
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,619
Easy, tydeus.

1116
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,521
(All yelling)

1117
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:55,889
(Both grunting)

1118
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:05,031
(Soldiers screaming)

1119
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,384
Hercules.

1120
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,323
(Laughs)

1121
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,462
(Tydeus choking)

1122
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,740
Lock shields!

1123
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:49,576
March!

1124
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,613
Find peace, my brother.

1125
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:14,601
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to
defeat a shield wall!

1126
01:31:14,836 --> 01:31:17,404
There is no way out!

1127
01:31:18,172 --> 01:31:20,540
Come out and face me!

1128
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,046
(Grunting)

1129
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:30,951
You're no hero! You're no God!

1130
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:33,386
You're nothing
but a mercenary!

1131
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:37,257
Your wife and
children deserved to die!

1132
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,726
(Yelling)

1133
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:44,998
(Gasps)

1134
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,933
(Continues yelling)

1135
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,447
Cotys: What're you doing?

1136
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:02,449
Get back up there!

1137
01:32:02,451 --> 01:32:05,552
Hercules must die!

1138
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:09,823
Come on!

1139
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:15,295
Kill that filthy bastard!

1140
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,466
(Whimpers)

1141
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,935
(Cotys screaming)

1142
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,333
(Thunder rumbling)

1143
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:17,891
All: (Chanting)
Hercules! Hercules!

1144
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:21,528
Hercules! Hercules!

1145
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,033
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

1146
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:30,637
Hercules! Hercules!

1147
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:35,942
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

1148
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:40,213
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

1149
01:33:40,215 --> 01:33:44,250
Amphiaraus: <i> You want to know</i>
<i>the truth about Hercules?</i>

1150
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:46,086
<i>There it is.</i>

1151
01:33:46,088 --> 01:33:50,357
<i>To be honest,
I prefer it to the legend.</i>

1152
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:54,561
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

1153
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:58,331
<i>Is he actually
the son of Zeus?</i>

1154
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:01,134
<i>I don't think it
really matters.</i>

1155
01:34:01,136 --> 01:34:04,838
<i>You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.</i>

1156
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,408
<i>You just need to
believe you're a hero.</i>

1157
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,578
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

1158
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:17,350
<i>But then again,
what the hell do I know?</i>

1159
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:20,754
<i>I'm supposed to
be dead by now.</i>

1160
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:25,458
(Lightning crashes)
