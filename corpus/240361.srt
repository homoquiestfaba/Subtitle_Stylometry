1
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,638
<i>Everyone is born.</i>
<i>But not everyone is born the same.</i>

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,952
<i>Some will grow to be butchers,</i>
<i>or bakers or candlestick makers.</i>

3
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,556
<i>Some will only be good</i>
<i>at making Jell-O salad.</i>

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,114
<i>But every human being is unique,</i>
<i>for better or forworse.</i>

5
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,348
<i>Most parents think their children</i>
<i>are the most beautiful things alive.</i>

6
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,593
<i>- Others are less emotional.</i>
- What a waste of time.

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,356
- $9.25 for a bar of soap!
- I had to take a shower.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,513
$5,000! I'm not paying it!
They can't repossess the kid!

9
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,639
- There's no way out.
- Make a U-turn.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,509
Harry!

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,635
<i>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood</i>
<i>lived in a very nice neighbourhood.</i>

12
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,598
<i>But they were not nice people.</i>

13
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,999
Get out of the street, you dodos!

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,352
<i>The Wormwoods were so busy,</i>
<i>they forgot they had a daughter.</i>

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,117
<i>If they had paid her any attention,</i>
<i>they'd have seen she was special.</i>

16
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,195
Oh, my gosh! Matilda!
Now look what you did!

17
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,636
You're supposed to <i>eat</i> the spinach!

18
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,908
Babies...
You're better off raising tomatoes!

19
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:00,111
<i>At two, Matilda had already</i>
<i>learned how to take care of herself.</i>

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,313
<i>As time went by,</i>
<i>she developed a sense of style.</i>

21
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,994
<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>Matilda's brotherwent to school.</i>

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,472
<i>Her fatherwent to work.</i>
<i>Selling used cars for unfair prices.</i>

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,270
<i>- Her mother took off to play Bingo.</i>
- Soup's on the stove...

24
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,830
<i>Matilda was left alone.</i>

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,470
<i>That was how she liked it.</i>

26
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,873
<i>At four. She had read</i>
<i>every magazine in the house.</i>

27
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,149
<i>One night. She asked her father for</i>
<i>something she desperately wanted.</i>

28
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,233
- A book? Why do you want a book?
- To read.

29
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,394
Why would you want to read,
when the television is right there?

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,879
- You get more out of watching TV.
- Get out of the way.

31
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,519
<i>Matilda already knew</i>
<i>she was different from her family.</i>

32
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,356
<i>She saw that whatever she needed.</i>
<i>She'd have to get herself.</i>

33
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,720
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

34
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,038
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

35
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,193
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Matilda set off in search of a book.</i>

36
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,077
- Where are the children's books?
- In that room.

37
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,157
- Would you like me to pick out one?
- No, thank you. I can manage.

38
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,398
<i>From then on, every day,</i>
<i>Matilda walked to the library.</i>

39
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,272
<i>She devoured one book after another.</i>

40
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,838
<i>When she finished all the children's</i>
<i>books. She searched for others.</i>

41
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,232
<i>Mrs. Phelps, who had been</i>
<i>watching herwith fascination, -</i>

42
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,392
<i>- offered Matilda some information.</i>

43
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
You can have your own library card,
and take books home.

44
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,315
- You can take as many as you like.
- That would be wonderful.

45
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,069
<i>Matilda's strong mind continued</i>
<i>to grow, nurtured by the authors -</i>

46
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,792
<i>- who had sent their books out into</i>
<i>the world, like ships onto the sea.</i>

47
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,833
<i>The books gave Matilda a comforting</i>
<i>message: You are not alone.</i>

48
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,038
Did any packages come today?

49
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,834
- Where did all this come from?
- The library.

50
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,076
- The library? You're only four!
- 6...

51
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,789
Then you'd be in school already.

52
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,556
I was supposed to start school
in September. You wouldn't listen.

53
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,553
Get up.

54
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,671
Give me that book!

55
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,675
- How old is Matilda?
- Four.

56
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,198
- I'm 6... I was six in August.
- You're a liar.

57
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,708
- I want to go to school.
- Who'd sign for the packages?

58
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,512
We can't leave valuable packages
on the doorstep. Go watch TV.

59
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,516
- There's something wrong with her.
- Tell me about it.

60
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,470
Hey, dipface! Have a marshmallow.
Have another!

61
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,391
Dipface!

62
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,919
<i>Matilda longed for a friend,</i>
<i>like the kind people in her books.</i>

63
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,279
<i>It occurred to her that</i>
<i>talking dragons and princesses -</i>

64
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,989
<i>- might exist only in story books.</i>

65
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,000
<i>But she was about to discover she</i>
<i>had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

66
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,238
<i>But she was about to discover she</i>
<i>had a strength she didn't know of.</i>

67
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,316
I'm great! I'm incredible!
Michael, pencil and paper.

68
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,268
- Did we sell some cars today?
- Did we!

69
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,557
- Can I get that new TV?
- Yeah!

70
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,193
It's time you learned the family
business. Write this down.

71
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:26,836
The first car I sold cost $320.
I sold it for $1.158.

72
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,429
The second one cost $512.
I sold it for $2.269!

73
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,071
- You're going too fast.
- Just write. The third cost $68.

74
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,271
I sold it for $999.
The fourth cost $1.100.

75
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,232
I sold it for
7,839 big American boffos!

76
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,191
- What was my profit for the day?
- $10.265.

77
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,909
Check it if you don't believe me.

78
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,795
- You saw the paper.
- From all the way over here?

79
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,509
Are you being smart with me?

80
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,276
- If you are, you'll be punished.
- Punished for being smart?

81
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,356
When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

82
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,751
- Person?
- Get up!

83
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,790
<i>Harry had unintentionally given</i>
<i>his daughter some practical advice.</i>

84
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,193
<i>He meant to say, "child".</i>
<i>Instead, he said, "person".</i>

85
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,198
<i>Thereby, he introduced the idea that</i>
<i>children could punish their parents.</i>

86
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,189
<i>Only when they deserved it.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

87
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,912
Michael, come into my room!

88
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,118
- What?
- I'll take you to work today, okay?

89
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,035
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I think appearance is important.

90
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,035
People don't buy a car. They buy me.
So I take pride in my appearance.

91
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,799
Well-oiled hair. Clean shave...
Get ready for a big day of learning.

92
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,353
There's a sucker born every minute.
We'll take them for all they've got.

93
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,071
- Give me the cookies.
- Here.

94
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,911
Okay, my boy! Heir to the throne!
Today we diddle the customers.

95
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,117
What are you looking at?

96
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,798
- Lovekins, where's my breakfast?
- Here we are, my heartstrings...

97
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,511
Snickerdoodle.
What did you do to your hair?

98
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,599
My hair?

99
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,551
Give me those things.
Get in the car.

100
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,195
Get in.

101
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,319
<i>Dirty dealings, like buying</i>
<i>stolen car parts, never stay secret.</i>

102
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,870
<i>Especially when the FBI</i>
<i>gets involved.</i>

103
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,913
- 9:17. Subject exits domicile.
- I've got 9:18.

104
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,469
9:17 is correct.

105
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,350
- One day, all this will be yours.
- This?

106
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,152
See thisjunker? I paid $100 for it.
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

107
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,392
Transmission's shot.
Bumpers are falling off...

108
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,554
What do I do with her?
I sell her!

109
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,989
We should weld these bumpers on,
but that takes time and money.

110
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,311
So we use Super Super Glue instead.

111
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,678
- Go ahead. Put it on there.
- Won't it fall off?

112
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,313
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Not to me. Okay? Transmission!

113
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,077
The sawdust lets the engine run
sweet as a nut. For a few miles.

114
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,631
- Daddy, that's cheating.
- Nobody ever got rich being honest.

115
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,794
20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand.

116
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,158
But the Feds like to test the
ingenuity of American businessmen.

117
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,678
Two-directional drill. If you run it
backwards, the numbers go down.

118
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,990
Cool!

119
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,919
- Daddy, you're a crook.
- What?

120
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,949
- This is illegal.
- Here, keep drilling.

121
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,717
- Do you make money?
- Don't people need good cars?

122
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,599
Can't you sell good cars?

123
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,517
I'm smart, you're dumb.
I'm right, you're wrong!

124
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,195
There's nothing you can do about it.

125
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,033
Harry, I won!
I hit the double bingo!

126
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,954
I'm taking you all to Cafe Le Ritz!

127
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,396
Let me see the money!

128
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,350
Your hair looks awful!
I hope they'll let you in.

129
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,593
- Here's your hat, Daddy.
- Get in the car.

130
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,192
- How much?
- It's for me to know.

131
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,668
- You never take us out.
- I took you to The Flipper.

132
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,234
- There was a comb in the soup.
- Oh, yeah! I like thatjoint.

133
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,188
- This way, please.
- Harry, take your hat off.

134
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,596
- I can't.
- You can't wear a hat inside.

135
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,151
- I can't take it off.
- Nobody cares about your hair.

136
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,517
I can't get it off.

137
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,512
I'm gonna get this hat off.

138
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,236
I think your head swelled up.

139
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,757
- You're pulling the skin!
- You're such a baby!

140
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,789
- The fibres are fused to the head!
- What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,356
I will not be a figure of ridicule!
I want respect!

142
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,519
I still don't see
how you glued your hat on, Harry.

143
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,630
I did not glue my hat to my head!
The fibres fused to my hair!

144
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,069
Baby, wait a minute!
I'm getting it now.

145
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,031
Oh, my God!

146
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,071
From now on, this family does
exactly what I say, when I say it!

147
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,800
Here's your hat.

148
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,432
Right now, we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

149
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>Are you ready to get sticky</i>
<i>with Mickey?</i>

150
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,468
<i>Are you ready to get sticky</i>
<i>with Mickey?</i>

151
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,190
Shut your light off.

152
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,398
<i>For those idiots who don't know</i>
<i>how to play, here's how it goes.</i>

153
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,917
<i>For each correct answer, you'll move</i>
<i>one step closer to our cube of cash!</i>

154
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,633
<i>Any money that sticks to your</i>
<i>gooey body, you get to take home!</i>

155
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,877
- Hi. Dad.
- Are you in this family?

156
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,716
Hello. Are you in this family?

157
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,597
What is this trash you're reading?

158
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,117
It's lovely. It's "Moby Dick",
by Herman Melville.

159
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,274
Moby what?
This is filth!

160
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,878
- It's a library book!
- I'm fed up with all this reading!

161
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,034
You're a Wormwood! Act like one!
Sit up and look at the TV!

162
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,796
<i>Get real sticky</i>
<i>and get cash for free.</i>

163
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,235
<i>Let's get sticky!</i>

164
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,717
- I didn't do it.
- Of course not, you little twit!

165
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,874
- I told you that was a cheap set.
- It's not cheap, it's stolen.

166
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,716
Put your light on!

167
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,469
<i>Was it magic, or coincidence?</i>

168
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,349
<i>We only use</i>
<i>a tiny portion of our brains.</i>

169
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,551
<i>The events of the following day</i>
<i>made Matilda discover her strength.</i>

170
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,238
- I need a car. Can you service me?
- Yes. Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

171
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,511
- Harry Wormwood, owner and founder.
- Agatha Trunchbull, Principal.

172
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,198
I want a tight car,
because I run a tight ship.

173
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,036
My school is a model of discipline.
"Use the rod. Beat the child."

174
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,555
Do you have brats?

175
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,919
- A boy, Mikey, and one mistake.
- They're all mistakes, children.

176
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,756
- I'm glad I never was one.
- I'm gonna make you a great deal.

177
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,195
You had better.

178
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,760
Thank you. Enjoy it.

179
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,158
Thank you. Enjoy it.

180
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,630
Hey, you.
You're going to school.

181
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,190
You'll get a real education
at this place.

182
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,077
<i>Matilda had always wanted</i>
<i>to go to school.</i>

183
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,313
<i>She tried to imagine</i>
<i>what her new school would be like.</i>

184
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,476
<i>She pictured a lovely building,</i>
<i>surrounded by trees and flowers.</i>

185
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,031
<i>There was a building. And children!</i>

186
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,638
<i>Regardless of how the school looked,</i>
<i>she was happy to be there.</i>

187
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,910
<i>After all, any school is better</i>
<i>than no school at all. Isn't it?</i>

188
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,474
You... detention.

189
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,112
You're too small. Grow up quicker!

190
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,915
Heads up! Shoulders back!

191
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,995
- Sorry.
- It's better than being out there.

192
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,917
- Is that my teacher?
- No, that's the principal.

193
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,270
The principal likes to snap a whip
in here to see who's hiding.

194
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,550
- I'm Matilda.
- Lavender.

195
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,669
- I'm Hortensia.
- Does she really hit children?

196
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,393
No. What she does is worse.
Like yesterday, in the second grade.

197
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,078
She makes weekly visits to show
the teachers how to handle kids.

198
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,520
- Julius ate two M&Ms.
- And she caught him?

199
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,796
- Julius ate two M&Ms.
- And she caught him?

200
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,155
Of course!

201
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,638
- Was Julius okay?
- He lived, if that's what you mean.

202
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,636
She used to be in the Olympics.
Shot-put, javelin, hammer throw.

203
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,917
So she does this all the time?

204
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,878
- It's better than the Chokey.
- Chokey?

205
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:37,037
It's a tall hole in the wall.
A drippy pipe with jagged edges.

206
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,510
The walls have nails sticking out.

207
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,070
Get in, you festering bowl of pus!

208
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,516
I've been in there twice.

209
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,073
- Didn't you tell your parents?
- Would your parents believe it?

210
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,152
You must obey Miss Trunchbull.

211
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,756
No. Here she comes!

212
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,470
Ah! Fresh meat!

213
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,516
- Amanda Thripp.
- Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

214
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:22,198
What are those...
hanging down by your ears?

215
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,831
- You mean my pigtails?
- Are you a pig?

216
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,994
- No. Miss Trunchbull.
- Do I allow pigs in my school?

217
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,635
- My mommy thinks they're sweet.
- Your mommy is a twit!

218
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,918
- Chop them off by tomorrow, or...
- But...

219
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,789
But?
Did you say "but"?

220
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,520
- Hammer throw.
- Definitely.

221
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,752
I'll give you "but".

222
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,477
- Good loft!
- Excellent release!

223
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,796
Think she'll make the fence?

224
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,199
Get to class before I throw you all
in the Chokey.

225
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,956
- Lavender, what's my teacher like?
- Run. Run. Run!

226
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,873
Faster! Get in!

227
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,312
<i>Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,</i>
<i>was one of those people -</i>

228
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,359
<i>- who appreciates every child</i>
<i>forwho she or he is.</i>

229
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,753
- I scooped these up for you.
- How lovely. Thank you, Amanda.

230
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,629
We have a new student with us today.

231
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,271
This is Matilda Wormwood.
I'd like you to sit with Lavender.

232
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,470
You all know how scary the first day
of school is. So be nice to Matilda.

233
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,430
Could you get her workbook, please?
You can sit down.

234
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,797
<i>Miss Honey was a wonderful teacher.</i>

235
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,069
<i>But her life was not as beautiful</i>
<i>as it seemed. She had a dark secret.</i>

236
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,519
<i>Though it caused her pain, it didn't</i>
<i>interfere with her teaching.</i>

237
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,199
You've come on a good day. We're
going to review what we've learned.

238
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,596
If you know an answer,
just raise your hand.

239
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,436
We've been working on our times
tables. Who'd like to demonstrate?

240
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,916
Let's do some together.

241
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,032
- 2 x 4 is?
- 8.

242
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,351
- 2 x 6 is?
- 12.

243
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,592
- 2 x 9 is?
- 18.

244
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,039
Soon you'll be able to do them all,
whether it's 2 x 7...

245
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,751
- 14.
- Or 13 x 379.

246
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,356
4,927.

247
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,112
- I beg your pardon?
- I think that's the answer.

248
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,831
13 x 379 is 4.927.

249
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,196
- It is.
- Wow...

250
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,674
- You can multiply big numbers?
- I read a book on mathematics.

251
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,313
- You like to read?
- Yes. I love to read.

252
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,512
- What do you like to read?
- I've been reading Darls Chickens.

253
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,196
Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

254
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,319
So could I.

255
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,835
All right, take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

256
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,197
I'll be back in a moment.

257
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,156
Gotcha! Right in the neck.

258
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,839
Come in.

259
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,753
Almost got you.

260
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,708
Good to see you, Jen.

261
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,668
Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

262
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,313
It's about the new girl in my class,
Matilda Wormwood.

263
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,040
Her father says she's a real wart.

264
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,988
A carbuncle. A blister.
A pustule of malignant ooze.

265
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,315
- Matilda is sweet and very bright.
- A bright child?

266
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,429
- She can multiply large sums.
- So can a calculator.

267
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,675
I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

268
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,630
You can't handle the little viper,
so you're trying to get rid of her.

269
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,396
- No...
- Typical, slothful cowardice!

270
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,272
The distance the shot-put goes
depends on your effort.

271
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,709
If you can't handle the little brat,
I'II lock her in the Chokey!

272
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,877
- Get it?
- Yes. Ma'am.

273
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,476
Everything I do
is for your own good.

274
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,952
And the good of
those putrescent, little children!

275
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,833
- Mom. I'm home.
<i>- How was school?</i>

276
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,279
- I get to do sixth grade work.
- Hold on a minute.

277
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,468
- Can't you see I'm on the phone?
- You just asked me how school was.

278
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,675
- The baby wasn't his.
- Well, it was really great.

279
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,470
- No way. They have to be implants.
- The principal is insane.

280
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,875
- She threw a girl over the fence.
- You should wax yours, too.

281
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,952
I have the most wonderful teacher.

282
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,478
Mine are driving me crazy.
Six hours at school is not enough.

283
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,710
I'll say.

284
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,352
Awhack to the belly.
A smack to the face. Burns is hurt.

285
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,954
Saved by the bell.

286
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,716
- Packages at this hour?
- Come here.

287
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,750
- Hello.
- We don't give money, charity...

288
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,118
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

289
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,196
What's she done now?
You! Go to your room, right now!

290
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,117
- She's your problem now.
- There is no problem.

291
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,875
Then beat it. We're watching TV.

292
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:21,071
If a TV show is more important than
Matilda, you shouldn't be a parent.

293
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,391
Turn it off and listen to me.

294
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,633
Come on in. Get this over with.
Mrs. Wormwood won't like this.

295
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,879
- Close the door.
- Who is it?

296
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,749
Some teacher.

297
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,151
- What did you do that for?
- What do you want?

298
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,792
- Matilda has a brilliant mind.
- Yeah, right. Give me a beer.

299
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,397
- Her math skills are extraordinary.
- Do you want one?

300
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,159
No thank you. She's reading material
that I didn't see until college.

301
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,356
College!

302
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,514
With private instruction, she'd be
ready for college in a few years.

303
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,437
A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

304
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,993
Look at you and me.
You chose books. I chose looks.

305
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:32,317
I have a nice house and a husband.
You teach children their ABC's.

306
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,756
You want Matilda to go to college?

307
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,118
I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

308
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,590
A bunch of hippies
and cesspool salesmen.

309
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,309
Don't sneer at educated people.

310
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,679
If you became ill, your doctor
would be a college graduate.

311
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,994
If you were sued, your lawyer
would have gone to college, too.

312
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,154
Sued by who?
Who have you been talking to?

313
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,915
Nobody.

314
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,076
I can see
we're not going to agree. Are we?

315
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,472
I'm sorry
I burst in on you like this.

316
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,229
We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

317
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,393
- Why's he standing in the middle?
- Because it's over.

318
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,394
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

319
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,517
- Who won?
- I don't know. You shut it off.

320
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,480
<i>The entire school will go</i>
<i>to the assembly room immediately!</i>

321
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,634
<i>The entire school will go</i>
<i>to the assembly room immediately!</i>

322
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,109
Sit!

323
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,999
- What's up?
- Beats me.

324
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,908
Bruce Bogtrotter.

325
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,076
Would little Brucey come up here?

326
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,433
He lives on my block.

327
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:34,873
This boy, Bruce Bogtrotter,
is a vicious sneak thief.

328
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,875
- You're a disgusting criminal.
- What are you talking about?

329
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,679
Chocolate cake.

330
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,154
You slithered like a serpent
into the kitchen and ate my snack!

331
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,596
Do you deny it?

332
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,439
Confess!

333
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:06,280
- I can't remember a specific cake.
- This one was mine.

334
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,753
- It was the best cake in the world.
- My mom's is better.

335
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,359
How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

336
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,435
Sit down, Bog.

337
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,517
Here we go.
Smells chocolatey, eh?

338
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,877
Now. Eat it!

339
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,872
I don't want any. Thank you.

340
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,316
Eat it!

341
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,554
Don't eat it.

342
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,996
- She wouldn't give him cake.
- It's poison.

343
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,589
- You look like you enjoyed that.
- Yes. Ma'am.

344
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,788
- You must have some more.
- No thanks.

345
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,272
But you'll hurt the cook's feelings.

346
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,950
She made this cakejust for you.

347
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,795
Her sweat and blood
went into this cake.

348
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,035
You will not leave this platform
until you have eaten the whole cake!

349
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,593
- The whole cake! See you at lunch.
- Thank you, Cookie.

350
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,039
You wanted cake, you got cake.
Now eat it!

351
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,714
Poor Brucey.

352
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,075
He's going to puke.

353
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,268
- I can't look. Is he going to puke?
- Without a doubt.

354
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,834
- Bruce looks real bad.
- Give up?

355
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,674
You can do it, Brucey!

356
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,198
Yeah, you can do it!

357
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,669
Go. Bruce!

358
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,998
Silence!

359
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,718
Silence!

360
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,188
Stop! Silence!

361
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,909
The entire assembly
will stay five hours after school!

362
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:39,315
Any children who object will go
straight into the Chokey. Together!

363
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,077
<i>Code R's the official way of saying</i>
<i>we've caught a bad one.</i>

364
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,669
- Where were you?
- Miss Trunchbull kept us late.

365
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:08,756
That's a lie! The packages were left
outside because you weren't here.

366
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,552
You get all this stuff from
catalogues and I don't get anything!

367
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,076
It's car parts. It's business.

368
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,109
- Why isn't it sent to the office?
- The cops are watching the office.

369
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,397
The cops are watching the house.

370
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,159
- They're parked outside, right now.
- Those are speedboat salesmen.

371
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,676
- Really nice guys.
- Cops.

372
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,833
Speedboats?
There are no lakes around here.

373
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,950
- Some people go away on weekends.
- And some people are cops.

374
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:57,312
They're not cops!
Go to bed, you lying little earwig!

375
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,235
<i>With the FBI watching her father,</i>
<i>and the Trunchbull at school. - </i>

376
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,313
<i>- it was a rare moment when Matilda</i>
<i>couldjust play.</i>

377
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,836
Afrog! Afrog! Afrog!

378
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,436
- What is it. Lavender?
- Afrog!

379
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,756
- It's a salamander.
- It's a chameleon.

380
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,118
"Any of the semiaquatic salamanders
from the genus triturus."

381
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,718
"Some are brightly coloured
and secrete irritating substances."

382
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,436
Useless, flaming car!

383
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,156
Wormwood! Sell me a lemon!

384
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,233
You're heading for the Chokey!
Teach you a lesson!

385
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,951
You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

386
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,113
- I'm nothing like my father!
- You're the spitting image!

387
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,280
The apple never rots
far from the tree!

388
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,832
- Miss Honey!
- Trunchbull is teaching our class.

389
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,629
She'll be here any second!

390
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,952
Make sure the water is cold.
Cover the fish!

391
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,237
Put away the art projects.

392
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,188
<i>Most great ideas</i>
<i>come from careful planning.</i>

393
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,831
<i>But sometimes.</i>
<i>Theyjustjump out at you.</i>

394
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,599
Last time, you forgot yourselves.
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.

395
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,790
- Don't laugh. Don't breathe loudly.
- Don't breathe at all.

396
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,117
Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

397
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,913
Sit!

398
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,915
Shoo.

399
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,590
I don't understand
why children are so disgusting.

400
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,911
They're like insects.

401
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,390
They should be got rid of.

402
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,790
The perfect school is one in which
there are no children.

403
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,950
Do you agree, Miss Honey?

404
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,111
You! Front of the class!

405
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,792
Are you okay?

406
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,159
Next time I tell you
to empty your pockets, do it faster!

407
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,279
This could be the most
interesting thing you've ever done.

408
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,633
Sit down, you squirming worm!

409
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,309
Get up!

410
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,910
- Can you spell?
- We can spell "difficulty".

411
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:22,791
- You can't spell "difficulty".
- She taught us with a poem.

412
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,350
How sweet. What poem is that?

413
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,436
Mrs. D. Mrs. I.
Mrs. F. F. I.

414
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,754
Mrs. C. Mrs. U.
Mrs. L. T. Y.

415
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,268
Why are all these women married?
You teach spelling, not poetry!

416
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,197
Why do small children
take so long to grow up?

417
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,319
They do it deliberately,
just to annoy me.

418
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,559
What's funny?

419
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,748
Spit it out! I like ajoke
as well as the next fat person.

420
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,274
It's a snake!

421
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,033
It's a snake!

422
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,236
One of you tried to poison me. Who?

423
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,756
Matilda! I knew it.

424
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,550
- It's not a snake. It's a newt.
- What did you say?

425
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,398
- It's a newt. Miss Trunchbull.
- Stand up! You did this.

426
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,872
- No. Miss Trunchbull.
- Did you have accomplices?

427
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:05,555
- I didn't do it!
- You thought you'd pay me back?

428
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,952
- Well, I'II pay you back.
- For what. Miss Trunchbull?

429
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,433
- For this newt, you pissworm!
- I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

430
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,516
Anyway, I'm big and you're small,
I'm right and you're wrong.

431
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,356
There's nothing you can do about it.
You're a liar and a scoundrel.

432
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,436
Your father is a cheat! You're the
most corrupt low-lifes in history!

433
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,751
Am I wrong? I'm never wrong.

434
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,756
In this classroom. In this school,
I am God!

435
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,159
- You!
- I didn't move!

436
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,314
- You did this.
- She was sitting way over here.

437
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,110
I'll be watching you.
Each and every one.

438
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,956
When you turn the corner,
when you get your smelly coats.

439
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,069
When you skip merrily to lunch.
I'll be watching you. All of you.

440
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,471
And especially you!

441
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,549
- Thanks for not telling.
- Best friends don't tell.

442
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,190
She can really dance.

443
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,832
I'm gonna clean up this mess.
I'll be out there in a minute.

444
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,199
- Miss Honey...
- Yes. Matilda?

445
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,673
- I did it.
- Did what?

446
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,233
- I made the glass tip over.
- Don't let her make you feel bad.

447
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:25,476
- It was an accident.
- I did it with my eyes. Watch.

448
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:34,238
It's wonderful you feel so powerful.
Many people don't.

449
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,792
Come on. Tip over.

450
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,078
- Tip over.
- It's all right, Matilda.

451
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:00,550
- I really did do it, Miss Honey.
- Sometimes you can do things.

452
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,236
But when you want to show someone,
then you can't.

453
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,236
- Or maybe something is broken...
- This isn't like that.

454
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,433
I don't know.
Maybe I made myself tired.

455
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,676
- Would you like to go to my house?
- I'd like that very much.

456
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,320
Good.

457
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,231
Good.

458
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,313
I just stare very hard
and I can feel the strongness.

459
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,075
I feel I can move almost anything.

460
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:45,078
- You do believe me. Don't you?
- You should believe in it.

461
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,438
Believe it with all your heart.

462
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,395
That's where Miss Trunchbull lives.

463
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,072
- Why is there a swing?
- A girl used to live in that house.

464
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,839
Her life was good and happy.
When she was two. Her mother died.

465
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,437
Her father was a doctor. He needed
someone to look after things.

466
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,910
He asked the mother's stepsister
to live with them.

467
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,437
But the girl's aunt was mean
and treated her badly.

468
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,592
- Trunchbull?
- Yes.

469
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:29,153
- Then the girl's father died.
- How did her father die?

470
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,711
- The police said he killed himself.
- Why would he do that?

471
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,190
No one knows.

472
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,714
The end is happier.
She found a small cottage.

473
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:51,036
She rented it for $50 a month and
planted hundreds of wild flowers.

474
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,115
- And she moved out of the house.
- Good for her.

475
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,989
- Do you know why I told you this?
- No.

476
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,194
Your family doesn't appreciate you.
One day, things will be different.

477
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:17,996
- Should we have tea and cookies?
- Yes, please.

478
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,955
- It's the cottage from your story.
- Yes.

479
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,673
The young woman is you!

480
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,119
- Then... No!
- Yes.

481
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,795
Aunt Trunchbull.

482
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,835
When I left Aunt Trunchbull's home.
I left all my treasures behind.

483
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,790
- Treasures?
- Photos of my mother and father.

484
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,956
And a beautiful doll my mother
gave me. Lissy Doll, I called her.

485
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,908
- Milk?
- Yes, please.

486
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,390
Why don't you run away?

487
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,951
I've thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

488
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,636
- Without teaching I'd have nothing.
- You're very brave.

489
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,469
- Not as brave as you.
- I thought adults weren't afraid.

490
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,953
All adults get scared,
just like children.

491
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,440
I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

492
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:30,792
I wonder
what Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

493
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,232
There she is!

494
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,828
- Shot-put. Hammer throw.
- Javelin.

495
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,276
Back. Back. Back.

496
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,479
- She's afraid of a cat?
- Black cats. She's superstitious.

497
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,478
- Poor kitty.
- He's all right.

498
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,958
- Let's go get your treasures.
- No!

499
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,476
She's gone. Come on!

500
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,796
Matilda!

501
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,872
Miss Honey!

502
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,313
Move, you piece ofjunkyard fodder!
Shift, you filthy...

503
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,432
My house!

504
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,029
Oh, my!

505
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:22,029
- My father's portrait was there.
- The artist must have been brave.

506
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,634
Really brave.

507
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,198
We should go...
Father's chocolate box.

508
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,992
After supper, he'd take a chocolate
and cut it in half.

509
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,118
And he'd give me the bigger half.

510
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,636
When he died.
I couldn't even sneak one.

511
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,112
She'd take a chocolate and say:

512
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,670
Much too good for children!

513
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,640
Have one.

514
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,195
No. She'd notice.

515
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,636
- Where's Lissy Doll?
- Upstairs.

516
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,114
Matilda...

517
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,393
This is my room.

518
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,190
- That's my dad.
- What's his name?

519
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,309
Magnus. I called him King Magnus.
And he called me Bumblebee.

520
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,077
- I don't think he killed himself.
- Neither do I.

521
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,954
Is that Lissy Doll?

522
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,673
Wormwood!

523
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,675
You useless. Used car salesman scum!
Come here. Now!

524
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,918
I know what "caveat emptor" means,
but I'm gonna sue you!

525
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,870
I'II burn down your shop! I'll shove
thatjalopy up your bazonga!

526
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,637
You're gonna look like roadkill!
You what...?

527
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,878
Come on.

528
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,075
- Shouldn't we hide?
- Go out the kitchen door.

529
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,800
I'll distract her.

530
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,029
Who's in my house?

531
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,518
Come out and fight like a man!

532
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,470
Tally-ho!

533
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,950
Come on.

534
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,159
Over there.

535
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,949
Some rats are gonna die today.

536
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,633
Oh, my goodness.

537
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,791
Feel my heart. Weren't you
the most scared you've ever been?

538
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:52,514
She shouldn't treat people that way.
Somebody has to teach her a lesson.

539
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,036
When she leaves, we'll get the doll.

540
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:00,830
- What?
- Just kidding.

541
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,992
Come here.

542
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,314
Promise me you'll never
go back in that house again.

543
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,191
- I promise.
- Okay. Come on.

544
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,351
He came home with $2.000 cash
and he threw it up in the air.

545
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:33,469
We swam in it like we were on
"The Million Dollar Sticky"!

546
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,634
- Do you like that show?
- I love that show.

547
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:44,272
Now he has money in banks all over.
But does he give me a dime?

548
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,433
- Matilda. This is Bob and Bill.
- They're cops.

549
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,470
- They are Ace Power Boat salesmen.
- Babyface, I'm starved!

550
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,872
- Hi, Harry.
- Who are you?

551
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,316
What is this? A hot tub party?

552
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,634
- You're entertaining surfers?
- They're cops, Dad.

553
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,160
- Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.

554
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,309
- Are you interested in time-share?
- Get out.

555
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,950
You don't let me talk to people!

556
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,112
I need to talk to someone
besides the kids.

557
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:24,799
A man is entitled to come home
and find dinner on the table!

558
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,671
- Dad. Yell at me, okay?
- Shut up and leave us alone!

559
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:36,233
- Yell at me again!
- I'll pound your miserable hide!

560
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,679
I want respect! You'll get
a tanning you won't forget!

561
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,195
My word is law!

562
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:54,310
<i>No kid likes being yelled at.</i>
<i>But Harry's ranting and raving -</i>

563
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,199
<i>- gave Matilda the key to her power.</i>

564
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,399
<i>To unlock that power,</i>
<i>all she had to do was practice.</i>

565
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,075
<i>Start acting like a Wormwood!</i>
<i>What are you? Stupid?</i>

566
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,277
<i>There's something wrong with her.</i>

567
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,798
<i>If you're a Wormwood, it's time</i>
<i>you started acting like one!</i>

568
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:38,519
<i>That was one of my favorites,</i>
<i>played for all you pretty ones.</i>

569
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,320
<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

570
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:41,672
<i>Playing music to make you smile...</i>

571
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,838
- Don't we need a search warrant?
- No. This guy's dirty.

572
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:05,111
We'll show this tape in court.
That box is full of stolen parts.

573
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,876
How about letting me
handle that camera for a while?

574
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,591
Do you know how to use it?
Do you know about the zoom?

575
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,276
- How to adjust the eye piece?
- I can handle it.

576
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,954
It's my turn.

577
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:29,069
- Your turn to drop it.
- I won't drop it.

578
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,472
You'll be in a lot of trouble.

579
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,154
The female minor.

580
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,279
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- I hope you have a search warrant.

581
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,595
If you don't, you could lose
your job or even go to prison.

582
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,909
Your father is going to prison.
Do you know where you'll end up?

583
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,789
- In an orphanage.
- We can make it a nice one.

584
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,239
The kind with food... and tiny
cockroaches. What do you say?

585
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,151
Your car is
about to run a stop sign.

586
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,316
<i>She bought some time for her dad.</i>

587
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,350
<i>But now. Matilda had</i>
<i>bigger fish to fry. Much bigger.</i>

588
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:49,078
- Hey, dipface. Where are you going?
- Out.

589
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:54,590
Have a carrot.

590
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,920
Chew your food!

591
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,272
Chew your food!

592
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,353
<i>Having power isn't as important</i>
<i>as what you do with it.</i>

593
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,833
<i>And what Matilda had in mind</i>
<i>was nothing short of heroic.</i>

594
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,312
Come on!

595
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,472
Lissy Doll, come on!

596
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,677
Please come here.

597
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,873
Leave me alone!

598
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,751
Magnus!

599
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,274
Miss Honey!
You'll never believe what I got you!

600
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,628
I also brought you this.
I ate mine last night.

601
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,750
I will be teaching your class today.

602
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:04,028
<i>Miss Honey was getting nervous,</i>
<i>but Matilda had a plan.</i>

603
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:09,593
- She is really raving mad.
- What did your father call you?

604
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,479
- Hummingbird?
- Bumblebee.

605
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,838
- She knows the doll is missing.
- And he called her Trunchbull?

606
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,838
- He called her Agatha.
- She called him Magnus, right?

607
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,472
Maybe I could put the doll back.
No. I can't do that.

608
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:33,349
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

609
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,789
- You promised you wouldn't go back.
- I was on the garage roof.

610
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,909
- I did it with my powers.
- All right. I need to think.

611
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,558
Powers?

612
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,273
I think I got them down.
Watch this.

613
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:38,392
And no more Miss Nice Girl.

614
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,472
Get inside, quickly! Run!

615
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,594
Get against that wall, quickly!

616
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,228
Water!

617
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:53,279
And hold the newt!

618
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,354
Join the ranks. Move!

619
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,511
I am here to teach you all a lesson.

620
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,758
Sometimes in life. Horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

621
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,319
These things
are a test of character.

622
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,914
And I have character.

623
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,153
Form a line across the room!

624
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,118
Fill this gap!

625
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,353
I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about.

626
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,356
A child came to my house.

627
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,990
I don't know how, when or why.

628
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,630
- May I...?
- No, you may not.

629
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,110
But I know a child came.

630
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:03,072
Did you know it was illegal to enter
someone's home without permission?

631
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,959
Yes. Miss Trunchbull.

632
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,549
Stomach in! Shoulders back!

633
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:16,033
Do any of you recognise this?

634
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,028
Let's play a game.

635
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:25,479
Who was wearing
a pretty, red ribbon yesterday -

636
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,393
- and isn't wearing one today?

637
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:35,796
Who does this disgusting ribbon
belong to?

638
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,472
I shall personally see to it
that the demented Lilliputian -

639
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:48,998
- who owns this ribbon will never
see the light of day again!

640
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,516
I was at your house last night.

641
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:56,673
I broke your arm once before.
I can do it again.

642
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:01,391
I'm not seven years old anymore,
Aunt Trunchbull.

643
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,077
Shut your holes!

644
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:12,839
You'll be put away in a place
where no one will find you.

645
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,833
Look!

646
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,878
The chalk!

647
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,270
"Agatha..."

648
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,189
"This is Magnus."

649
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:39,434
"Give my little Bumblebee...

650
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:45,709
...her house and her money."

651
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,670
"Then get out of town.
If you don't, I will get you."

652
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,833
"I will get you like you got me."

653
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,310
"That is a promise."

654
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,159
Please don't throw him.

655
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,553
Lavender!

656
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,591
It's the Trunch!

657
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,598
Look at this!

658
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,876
Let go.

659
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,555
- I didn't know I could do that.
- Pretty good.

660
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,353
<i>Trunchbull was gone,</i>
<i>never to be seen or heard from. - </i>

661
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,200
<i>- never to darken a doorway again.</i>

662
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,076
<i>- Never to darken a doorway again.</i>

663
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:00,554
<i>Miss Honey moved back to her house,</i>
<i>and Matilda was a frequent visitor.</i>

664
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,872
Did you know the heart of a mouse
beats 650 times a minute?

665
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,032
- Where did you learn that?
- In a book.

666
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,715
It beats so fast.
It sounds like it's humming.

667
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,075
Hey, you!

668
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,277
We're leaving. Let's go.

669
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,831
- Let's wrap these up.
- I'd be happy to walk her home.

670
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,120
- We're moving to Guam.
- Guam?

671
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,909
- Daddy's out of business.
- I don't want to!

672
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,835
- We're taking a permanent vacation!
- We have to hurry to the airport.

673
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,630
I love it here!
Please don't let them take me.

674
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,078
- Get in the car. Melinda!
- Matilda! I want to stay here!

675
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,630
Why would she want
a disobedient kid?

676
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,110
She's wonderful and I love her.

677
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:04,116
- Adopt me, Miss Honey!
- I don't have time for this.

678
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,114
- I have the adoption papers.
- What?

679
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,796
- Where did you get those?
- From a book in the library.

680
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,236
Are you hearing this, Harry?

681
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,473
- You just have to sign.
- I'll be an only child again!

682
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,438
I can't think with all these sirens!

683
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,838
What do you think, pumpkin?

684
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:36,272
You're the only daughter I ever had.
And I never understood you.

685
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,390
Who's got a pen?

686
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,348
- Here.
- Thanks.

687
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:54,829
<i>This was perhaps the first decent</i>
<i>thing they ever did for Matilda.</i>

688
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,470
And here.

689
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:04,428
Come here. Turn around.

690
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:12,509
- You won't want support payments?
- No. We have everything we need.

691
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:16,195
Let's roll.

692
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,353
<i>So Harry and Zinnia got away.</i>
<i>And as bad as things were, -</i>

693
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,479
<i>- that's how good they became.</i>

694
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:45,514
<i>Miss Honey was made</i>
<i>principal of the school.</i>

695
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,198
<i>And Matilda found, to her surprise,</i>
<i>that life could be fun.</i>

696
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,830
<i>She decided to have</i>
<i>as much fun as possible.</i>

697
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,675
<i>After all, she was a very smart kid.</i>

698
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:19,478
<i>Matilda and Miss Honey each got</i>
<i>what they had always wanted:</i>

699
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,315
<i>A loving family.</i>

700
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:28,076
<i>And Matilda never had to use</i>
<i>her powers again.</i>

701
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,516
<i>Well. I mean almost never.</i>

702
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,080
"Call me Ishmael."

703
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:49,120
"Some years ago,
never mind how long, precisely..."

704
