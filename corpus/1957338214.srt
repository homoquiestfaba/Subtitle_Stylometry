You guys gonna go outside?

I'll help you get out there.

A Mr. Shanrock here to see you.
Says he's an attorney.

82
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:22,175
- Should I tell him you dead?

Have you seen
<i>The Register</i> today?

86
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,090
I'm sorry to let you know that,

87
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:40,027
a former client has passed away.

88
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:42,563
We've lost...

89
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,199
Rita Parker Sloan.

90
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,005
Rita specified in her will
that you

91
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,573
were to do her hair
and make-up for the funeral.

92
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:58,279
Uh, first showing is day
after tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

93
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,284
Ransom Funeral Home will require
your services tomorrow night.

(paper rustles)

95
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,991
That photo is from a year ago.

96
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:14,528
Perhaps you could recreate
the same hairstyle?

97
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,332
- Split ends and all?
- He speaks!

98
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:23,270
Oh, I'll... I'll never forget...

99
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:27,607
how you used to make up Rita
for her Christmas parties

100
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,875
at the mansion.

101
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,312
Boy oh boy, Patrick...

102
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,414
you made Rita Parker Sloan

103
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,283
the most glamorous woman
in town.

104
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,952
She should
have updated her will.

105
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,921
I entered
her final revisions personally

106
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:43,122
a week before she died.

107
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:47,560
Rita left me as a client.
You remember?

108
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:51,231
I also remember
you were close friends,

109
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:53,634
- dear friends.
- (sighs)

110
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:55,236
(clicks tongue)

111
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:57,637
I haven't pulled hair in years.

112
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:01,408
Naturally,
the will makes a provision

113
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,177
for services rendered.

114
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:06,880
(paper rustling)

115
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,554
Rita wants to make things right.

116
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:21,028
I'm retired.

- (chair whirs)

118
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,465
Let bygones be bygones,
Patrick.

119
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,202
It's not healthy
to hold a grudge.

120
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:35,342
You would deny
a great woman her dying wish?

121
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,544
(door opens)

122
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,213
Show the gentleman the door.

123
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,185
Mr. Shanrock?

124
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,357
Bury her with bad hair.

125
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,026

Rita.

282
00:26:57,255 --> 00:27:01,060
And took one of my most
important clients with her.

283
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,230
- That took some nerve.
- Yeah, and then my friend died.

Your friend, David?

285
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:14,640

And I took a second mortgage.

He got everything. I lost it.

(muffled singing)

391
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,785
- David: <i>Hey, mister.</i>
- (muffled singing)

David: <i>Everyone's here.</i>

Evie: Can you hear me?

00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,503
(indistinct chatter)

397
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:17,709
You tore my house down?

398
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,546
(sighs)

399
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,948
- She was just too far gone.
- Evie: We feel sick.

400
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,220
Did you find
anything down there?

401
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:34,193
- Like what?
- There was a box of Vivanté.

402
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,164
Ooh! Don't go anywhere.

403
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,104
Please, let's step outside.

404
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:55,981
Here, David and I
planted the calla lilies.

405
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:02,853
And there, was the fountain.

406
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,289
Evie: Oh, is that what that was?

407
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,327
My client,

408
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:13,097
Rita, donated the tiles
she brought back from Italy,

409
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:15,133
to do her master bath.

410
00:38:15,434 --> 00:38:18,035
But then she changed her
mind about the color.

411
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:18,938
(Evie chuckles)

412
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,579
David built it.
Everything from scratch.

413
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,651
- Sounds like quite a guy.
- But he didn't have a will.

414
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:35,287
Oh.

415
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,159
His nephew inherited everything.

416
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:46,097
(Evie grunts)

417
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:50,034
Well, at least something like
that can never happen today.

418
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:54,640
- Yeah. Great.
- Surprise! Remember this?

419
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,308
Where's my shampoo?

420
00:38:57,742 --> 00:38:59,745
This was all that was
left in your old house.

421
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:07,952
I think I should go.

422
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:10,355
Will you come back
and visit sometime?

423
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,325
Yeah.

424
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:19,098
(sad music playing)

425
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,336
- Evie: Bye, Pat.
- Scottie: Bye.

426
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,105
- Thanks for the lunch!
- (Evie chuckles)

427
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,328
Pat: Sandusky, here I come.

428
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,237
- Hello.
- Hi.

429
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:05,910
(dramatic music playing)

430
00:40:16,488 --> 00:40:17,723
Eunice?

431
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,159
Eunice?

432
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:24,063
Eunice.

433
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:27,066

434
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,106

435
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,842
man over phone:
<i>Shanrock and Shanrock.</i>

436
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:39,443
Pat: <i>Uh, Walter Shanrock,
please.</i>

437
00:40:39,477 --> 00:40:41,480
man over phone: <i>He's at the
courthouse until 4:00.</i>

438
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:45,784
- <i>What's this in reference to?</i>
- Pat: <i>Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

439
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,124
Uh, cream and sugar.

440
00:40:56,894 --> 00:40:57,862
(objects clatter)

441
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:09,006
(car engine revving)

442
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:19,284
Ro Ro:
<i>Try Dee Dee Dale's downtown.</i>

443
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:21,152
woman: <i>Dee Dee has everything.</i>

444
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,488
Phyllis: <i>I graduated
with Dee Dee. She nasty.</i>

445
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,159
(car engine revving)

446
00:41:30,994 --> 00:41:32,764
That'll be 83 cents.

447
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:37,903
Thank you.

448
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:42,474
(seagulls cawing)

449
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,212

(church bell tolling)

451
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:15,106
David: <i>Hey, mister.</i>

452
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,376
<i>Come to the garden.</i>

453
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:44,203
(water splashing)

454
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:50,209
(inhales)

455
00:43:21,673 --> 00:43:23,408
man: So sorry
to hear about Rita.

456
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:24,877
Shanrock: Yes, great woman.

457
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,312
Pat: Mr. Shanrock.

458
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:33,117
- Pat: Mr. Shanrock?
- Pat?

459
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:38,456
I'll do Rita. One condition.

460
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:41,927
I need cash now.

461
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:44,930
Oh, I'm sure,
Rita would be tickled pink.

462
00:43:45,396 --> 00:43:47,131
But there's a protocol, Pat.

463
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:50,434
I can't just make a withdrawal
from First Sandusky.

464
00:43:50,468 --> 00:43:53,572
Oh no?
Your brother owns the bank!

465
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:58,109
We will be delighted to
prepare a certified check

466
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:02,581
for 25,000 dollars after
the estate clears probate.

467
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:06,584
- And how long will that take?
- No more than six months.

468
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:11,188
Six months?
I'll be dead by then!

469
00:44:11,222 --> 00:44:14,124
Listen, buster. I know
we've had our ups and downs.

470
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,393
But like I told you,

471
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,662
when your partner's next
of kin retained the firm,

472
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:20,432
to settle his estate,
I don't make the rules.

473
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:22,700
And I most certainly
don't walk around town

474
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,436
with my client's money.

475
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:30,976
I have expenses. I have
to purchase beauty products.

476
00:44:34,644 --> 00:44:40,017
Give me a loan. Some
kind of advance, please.

477
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:46,557
(groans) Would two tens help?

478
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:58,202
The Ransoms will have
Rita ready by 7:00 p.m. tonight.

479
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:01,238
Please be prompt. You know
Sherman doesn't like to wait.

480
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:12,050
(indistinct chatter)

481
00:45:17,755 --> 00:45:19,090
(alarm blaring)

482
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,293
man over PA: <i>Please stop!
Please stop! Please stop!</i>

483
00:45:27,064 --> 00:45:28,733
(birds chirping)

484
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:33,604
- Jeffrey, keep the change.
- Why, thank you.

485
00:45:34,372 --> 00:45:37,743
(seagulls cawing)

486

(car engine revving)

490
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,334
Tristan: <i>I don't have
a two, I don't have three,</i>

491
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,804
I don't have four,
but I have five.

492
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:43,207
Linda,
I'm gonna take you at five.

493
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,742
We're gonna do the straightener.

494
00:46:45,477 --> 00:46:48,680
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

495
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:53,617
Okay. I'm just gonna
put this in for you.

496
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:56,521
And, here's five percent off
of your next

497
00:46:56,553 --> 00:46:59,624
and you'll have Caroline.
She's so good. Okay, darling?

498
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:01,292
- Thank you very much.
- Of course.

499
00:47:01,325 --> 00:47:03,294
- Have a wonderful day.
- You too.

500
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:06,098
- (metal clanks)
- (upbeat music playing)

501
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,805
Dee Dee: Oh my God.

502
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:19,244
Pat?

503
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:22,481
Is it you?

504
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:24,815
No.

505
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:27,351
Dee Dee: You look so...

506
00:47:29,787 --> 00:47:30,856
athletic.

507
00:47:32,256 --> 00:47:34,759
(indistinct chatter)

508
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:38,729
Wow. Come on in.

509
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:43,767
(sighs)
Now, Tristan, check this out.

510
00:47:45,336 --> 00:47:47,671
This man gave me
my first job in the business.

511
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:51,909
And now he is,
mopping your Vivanté.

512
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,445
Well...

513
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:57,849
he shouldn't have done that,
but after all,

514
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:03,220
you gotta catch this guy a break
'cause, he really is a legend.

515
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,724
This is Patrick Pitsenbarger.

516
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:10,794
He did all the socialites
of Sandusky back in the day.

517
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,900
That's right. Once upon a time.

518
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:20,772
Well, I can dust that off
for you if you want.

519
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,945
Yeah, you know,
I started off sweeping hair,

520
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,715
and then, I worked my way all
the way up to second chair.

521
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:35,719
I was so proud when Dee Dee
opened up her own shop.

522
00:48:36,253 --> 00:48:39,191
Right across the street
from mine.

523
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:46,198
You know, Patrick
was always so particular.

524
00:48:47,131 --> 00:48:50,401
Pat: And Dee Dee was very nice
to my clients.

525
00:48:51,001 --> 00:48:56,273
In fact, she took my best
one with her when she quit.

526
00:48:59,677 --> 00:49:01,479
Well, Sandusky is...

527
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,849
having a real comeback
right now, huh?

528
00:49:06,784 --> 00:49:07,818
Maybe...

529
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:12,591
My business is doing great.
I know that.

530
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,493
I mean, I've had to expand
this place and make it

531
00:49:16,526 --> 00:49:20,231
a multi-service salon
with all the amenities.

532
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:26,671
Clients want craft, Dee Dee,
not bells and whistles.

533
00:49:27,738 --> 00:49:28,873
No...

534
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:34,011
God forbid, you ever listened
to anybody about anything.

535
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,884
(scissors snipping)

536
00:49:41,385 --> 00:49:42,754
You know what, they, uh...

537
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:46,658
they've discontinued the Vivanté

538
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:50,562
because it's...
It's got too high VOCs.

539
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:52,896
But you know,
I mean, there's plenty

540
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:55,932
of green and clean technologies

541
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,736
you know, that came up after you
lost your little shop.

542
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:00,672
(scoffs)

543
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:06,778
But that's okay.
It's Rita's favorite.

544
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:08,380
Oh.

545
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:15,352
Well, maybe, you're gonna have
to tell Rita that in Heaven.

546
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:18,856
I mean,
you don't even know this,

547
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:21,892
but Rita kicked the bucket
this week.

548
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:26,797
My dear,
I'm on the way to Ransom.

549
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:29,800
No, you're not.

550
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,005
Sherman is doing her, in house.

551
00:50:35,673 --> 00:50:41,713
Shanrock came personally.
And he begged me.

552
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,784
He begged me to do her hair.

553
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:48,018
Really?

554
00:50:48,718 --> 00:50:54,892
In death, Rita remembered
that she had taste.

555
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:00,999
Taste or dementia? You decide.

556
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,936
But anyway, you know,
whatever you gotta do

557
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:07,539
to feel good about yourself.

558
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:16,414
Guess what, I'm gonna give
this to you for 2.49.

559
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:19,416
That's a dead stock discount.

560
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:23,788
Oh, you don't have the money?

561
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:29,526
Aw, I'm sorry.
I can't give it to you.

562
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,995
Because guess what,

563
00:51:31,561 --> 00:51:33,997
I'm still waiting
for my last three paychecks.

564
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:41,139
All right... silly!

565
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:44,007
So it's...
I'm gonna give it to you.

566
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:47,912
It's just, I mean, I...

567
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:53,051
I don't know how much it's gonna
do you because, you know...

568
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:55,552
all the bald spots.

569
00:51:56,019 --> 00:52:00,858
(phone ringing)

570
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:10,401
(breathes heavily)

571
00:52:13,637 --> 00:52:16,140
Dee Dee: <i>I didn't steal Rita
from you, Mister Pat.</i>

572
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:23,514
You dropped the ball
and I was there to catch it.

573
00:52:34,224 --> 00:52:37,094
(pants) Eunice?

574
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:40,164
Eunice!

575
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:48,206
(birds chirping)

576
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:54,579
(dog barking)

577
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:02,486
- (scrapes)
- man over radio: <i>WCPZ...</i>

578
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:07,758
(objects clatter)

579
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:12,162
- Hmm.
- (objects clatter)

580
00:53:14,664 --> 00:53:16,867
(hangers clattering)

581
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:25,175
- You made me blonde.
- Excuse me?

582
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:27,512
I wasn't sure at first,

583
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:30,914
but then I saw the rings
and I knew.

584
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:34,017
I came to you
when I was nineteen. Remember?

585
00:53:34,885 --> 00:53:37,588
- Yes.
- (laughs)

586
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:39,090
I wouldn't think
you would remember.

587
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:40,691
I only came in there once.

588
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,193
I'm sorry.

589
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:45,829
Are you kidding me?
You were wonderful.

590
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:48,600
I had a young one
at the time

591
00:53:48,832 --> 00:53:51,202
and I couldn't keep up
with the blonde maintenance.

592
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:56,207
Or the price, as I recall.
You weren't cheap.

593
00:53:56,874 --> 00:54:00,645
- (clicks tongue) No?
- (laughing)

594
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,280
(sighs)

595
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,715
Pat: I'm surprised
you still remember me.

596
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:08,952
Who could forget the
"Liberace of Sandusky?"

597
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,990
- Was I that butch?
- (laughs)

598
00:54:14,892 --> 00:54:16,594
Can I help you find something?

599
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,664
How about everything?

600
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:23,301
(inhales)
Oh! Give me one second.

601
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:26,169
(footsteps receding)

602
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:38,216
Ta-da!

603
00:54:40,184 --> 00:54:42,653
I've been saving it
for the right customer.

604
00:54:43,854 --> 00:54:44,789
Try it on?

605
00:54:49,093 --> 00:54:50,628
So, how's it fitting?

606
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,298
Pat: Not sure
I can still pull it off.

607
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:54,998
(inhales) Show me.

608
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,802
(gasps)

609
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:00,771
(music playing)

610
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,675
Don't move.

611
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:15,887
(music playing)

612
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:20,691
The icing on the cake.

613
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,135
You're starting
to look like you again.

614
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:34,138
Thank you, Sue.

615
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:38,375
How did you know my name?

616
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:41,379
You came for a perm

617
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:43,982
and I talked you
into a "Dorothy Hamill."

618
00:55:45,048 --> 00:55:49,186
And you told me that you
dropped out of nursing school

619
00:55:49,452 --> 00:55:51,121
because you got pregnant.

620
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:55,360
And the name of your son,
is Danny.

621
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:59,263
You know, sometimes,
it takes a while.

622
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:02,800
But it's all up there somewhere.

623
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:07,137
My husband thought
the "Dorothy Hamill" cut

624
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:08,673
was too short, by the way.

625
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:14,945
But, looking back...
I never felt prettier.

626
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,016
It's still in there.

627
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:22,387
(sighs) I wish.

628
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:26,290
I must tell you something.

629
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:31,963
I don't have any money.

Pat is back.

647
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:56,880
Dustin:
It's a win-win proposition.

648
00:57:56,914 --> 00:57:58,216
- (creaking)
- (chuckling)

649
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,017
Dustin: We...
We'll sharpen our pencils

650
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,385
and make it happen.

651
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:05,790
Uh, that's the funeral home.
Let me circle back to you later.

652
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:07,925
Mr. Ransom.

653
00:58:09,992 --> 00:58:12,262
No, it's 50 extra chairs,
not 30.

654
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:14,298
She was very specific.

655
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,936
Oh, I appreciate you going
the extra mile for grandma.

656
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:21,305
Thank you, sir.

657
00:58:23,273 --> 00:58:24,142
Hello?

658
00:58:26,008 --> 00:58:27,311
I can still see you there.

659
00:58:31,314 --> 00:58:34,385
- What do you want?
- I'm the hairdresser.

660
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,488
Oh my God. Pat?

661
00:58:39,956 --> 00:58:41,092
I'm Dustin.

662
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,527
Rita's grandson.

663
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:46,797
So nice to finally meet you!

664
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,499
I remember when you were born.

665
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:50,433
(chuckles)

666
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:55,372
Well, this calls for a highball.
Please.

667
00:58:58,474 --> 00:59:00,177
Welcome. Please, come in.
(chuckles)

668
00:59:01,177 --> 00:59:02,846
(door creaks)

669
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:04,148
Pat: Thank you.

670
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:07,552
(door creaks)

671
00:59:12,088 --> 00:59:13,857
We had hospice in the home.

672
00:59:16,325 --> 00:59:17,260
Come.

673
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:44,321
Did you style her wedding?

674
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:47,325
- All three of them.
- (chuckles)

675
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:53,898
(calm music playing)

676
00:59:58,468 --> 01:00:01,272
Grandma chose all the photos
for her funeral display.

677
01:00:04,106 --> 01:00:06,177
(paper rustles)

678
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:12,483
(sighs) She was...
She was quite the perfectionist.

679
01:00:12,782 --> 01:00:14,485
Pat: Is that what you call it?

680
01:00:16,186 --> 01:00:17,388
(chuckles)

681
01:00:19,189 --> 01:00:21,158
Dustin: So, how did you put up
with her all those years?

682
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:26,130
Canadian whiskey. Rocks.

683
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,966
(chuckles) I'll get it.

684
01:00:33,436 --> 01:00:35,305
You must have some
great memories of this house.

685
01:00:36,606 --> 01:00:39,176
- (drink pours)
- I never set foot inside.

686
01:00:39,776 --> 01:00:41,178
- (glass clinks)
- What?

687
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,079
- (thuds)
- (scoffs)

688
01:00:45,215 --> 01:00:46,483
What about all those parties?

689
01:00:47,684 --> 01:00:48,686
(chuckles)

690
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,025
I always knew my place.

691
01:00:57,427 --> 01:00:58,428
I'll get some ice.

692
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:05,168
(footsteps receding)

693
01:01:09,139 --> 01:01:11,575
(chandelier chimes)

694
01:01:14,311 --> 01:01:17,648
(door creaks, closes)

695
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:25,256
- (clock ticking)
- (exhales)

696
01:01:25,488 --> 01:01:31,428
(breathes heavily)

697
01:01:31,628 --> 01:01:35,532
- (ominous music playing)
- (phone ringing)

698
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:39,602
- (breathes heavily)
- (phone ringing)

699
01:01:40,336 --> 01:01:41,472
(beeps)

700
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,341
Rita: <i>You have reached
Rita Parker Sloan.</i>

701
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,309
<i>Please leave a message,</i>

702
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:48,379
<i>and I shall return your call
at my earliest convenience.</i>

703
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:49,280
(beeping)

704
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:53,516
- (static)
- (breathes heavily)

705
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:57,188
- (beeping)
- (door opens, creaks)

706
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,222
(door closes)

707
01:02:03,492 --> 01:02:04,361
Pat?

708
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,570
(slurps)

709
01:02:17,374 --> 01:02:19,377
(indistinct chatter)

710
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:22,345
- (clock ticking)
- Another double, please.

711
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:25,115
- Oh, thirsty, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

712
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,753
In five minutes...

713
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:34,025
I'm supposed to make a
dead bitch look human.

714
01:02:37,293 --> 01:02:40,263
Not sure
I'm up for the challenge.

715
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:44,334
At least she won't complain.

716
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:46,236
- For once.
- (chuckling)

717
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:47,772
Gabriel: Was she a handful?

718
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:51,775
Oh! A demanding,
Republican monster,

719
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:56,813
but she had great taste,
in shoes.

720
01:02:56,847 --> 01:02:59,650
(scoffs)
Sounds like a nightmare.

721
01:03:00,784 --> 01:03:03,119
(upbeat music playing)

722
01:03:03,787 --> 01:03:05,523
I adored her.

723
01:03:14,197 --> 01:03:15,599
(Pat whistles)

724
01:03:18,735 --> 01:03:20,838
Nobody remembers me.

725
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:27,577
I used to perform here...
every Saturday night.

726
01:03:27,778 --> 01:03:30,481
Really?
What was your drag name?

727
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:31,814
Mister Pat.

728
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,684
(scoffs)
Must have been before my time.

729
01:03:35,285 --> 01:03:39,423
Yes. It was before
you were conceived.

730
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,693
- You see that stage?
- Gabriel: Uh-huh.

731
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:50,367
My lover, David, built that.
He was, uh, very handy.

732
01:03:52,468 --> 01:03:55,171
In more ways than one.

733
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:57,108
(chuckles)

734
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,243
I sewed the curtains,

735
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:04,180
and Eunice
put the glitter in the paint.

736
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:09,552
Every queen in town pitched
in to open this dump.

737
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:15,526
But maybe you're too young
to know who Tim and Mike was.

738
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:16,794
They opened the bar.

739
01:04:17,961 --> 01:04:21,564
There were so many people
I remember.

740
01:04:21,798 --> 01:04:26,137
Miss Cheesecake, Dirty Ankle?

741
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:31,775
And there was one very
interesting customer.

742
01:04:32,742 --> 01:04:33,878
Harry.

743
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:40,383
He was a truck driver
and he came every Saturday

744
01:04:41,218 --> 01:04:42,820
to see me perform.

745
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,159
"Mister Pat."
He was very nice.

746
01:04:50,459 --> 01:04:53,563
Well, I heard
that most of the regulars

747
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:56,233
stopped coming out. But...
But maybe your friends will

748
01:04:56,265 --> 01:04:59,336
will make it tonight,
for old times' sake.

749
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:08,478
(upbeat music playing)

750
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,450
This place was family.

751
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:21,724
What's happened with
the crystal chandelier,

752
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,494
that hung above the dance floor?

753
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:27,463
It got old. They took it down.

754
01:05:27,764 --> 01:05:28,731
Pat: Huh.

755
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:32,969
Another of Rita's hand-me-downs.

756
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:40,276
If she would have known,
what these crystals have seen.

757
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:42,213
Oh!

758
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:53,756
- What? Where?
- Tonight's the last night.

759
01:05:54,957 --> 01:05:56,459
I don't understand.

760
01:05:56,726 --> 01:05:59,363
Harvey sold out to
some young gay couple.

761
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:01,298
They're turning
the whole building into this

762
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:03,733
straight, gastro micro brew pub.

763
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:05,635
"Gastro" what?

764
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:09,939
They are installing giant tanks
to brew artisan craft beer.

765
01:06:10,206 --> 01:06:11,575
(inhales)

766
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:13,776
But where will we dance?

767
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,285
(sighs)

768
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:32,862
- Here. Keep the change.
- (gasps) Hey, big spender.

769
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,639
(high-pitched ringing)

770
01:06:42,972 --> 01:06:45,942
(disco music playing)

771
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:50,581
- (audience cheering)
- Pat: <i>I'm back.</i>

772
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,583
<i>Why don't you see me?</i>

773
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,486
<i>I'm right here.</i>

774
01:06:58,655 --> 01:07:05,296
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- (audience cheering)

775
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:10,801
man: <i>Pick it up, guys.
We're falling behind.</i>

776
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,469
(seagulls cawing)

777
01:07:18,508 --> 01:07:23,314
Send that arrangement back.
Everything must be perfect.

778
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:28,918
- (car engine revving)
- Taxi!

779
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:35,059
- Where to?
- I don't know. Just drive!

780
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:38,694
(breathes heavily)

781
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:39,896
Dustin:
<i>Grandma chose all the photos</i>

782
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:41,731
<i>for her funeral display.</i>

783
01:07:41,764 --> 01:07:42,898
Shanrock: <i>Rita wants
to make things right.</i>

784
01:07:42,932 --> 01:07:44,368
Dee Dee: <i>God forbid</i>

785
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,470
<i>you ever listen
to anybody about anything.</i>

786
01:07:47,803 --> 01:07:49,405
(breathes heavily)

787
01:07:49,972 --> 01:07:53,576
- (dog barking)
- (ominous music)

788
01:07:54,477 --> 01:07:57,414
(pants)

789
01:08:05,088 --> 01:08:09,892
(wind howling)

790
01:08:20,135 --> 01:08:22,805
(seagulls cawing)

791
01:08:28,577 --> 01:08:32,548
(sighs)

792
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:39,790
(seagulls cawing)

793
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:49,900
Eunice?

794
01:08:52,235 --> 01:08:53,469
Eunice.

795
01:08:54,504 --> 01:08:55,939
Eunice: Yeah?

796
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:01,477
Holy hell!

797
01:09:02,745 --> 01:09:05,782
Pat, you're still alive?

798
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:10,786
- You're still sucking cock?
- Christ on the cross, queen.

799
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,688
A bitch can't even
powder her nose

800
01:09:12,722 --> 01:09:14,590
without getting
the third degree.

801
01:09:15,558 --> 01:09:18,762
Now, step back,
lemme get a good look at you.

802
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,866
You look fantastic.

803
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:31,875
- Shit, I just saw your shoes.
- (laughs)

804
01:09:33,843 --> 01:09:37,180
- (laughs)
- Eunice: Oh baby, I missed you.

805
01:09:37,213 --> 01:09:39,916
I missed you too.
Don't overdo it.

806
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:41,617
Oh, I always do.

807
01:09:42,885 --> 01:09:43,786
Hmm.

808
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:49,792
I heard the Fruit and Nut
is closing. You going?

809
01:09:51,693 --> 01:09:53,196
I haven't set foot in years.

810
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:56,200
Why not?

811
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,769
Gay bars are so '90s.

812
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:03,039
The Velvet Slipper's gone
in Lorain

813
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:05,641
and the bar in Mansfield's
about to close too.

814
01:10:06,776 --> 01:10:08,945
- Our safe places.
- Mm-hmm.

815
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:10,780
I mean, who needs
the Fruit and Nut

816
01:10:10,812 --> 01:10:13,182
when they can
hold hands at Applebee's?

817
01:10:13,982 --> 01:10:15,017
(laughs)

818
01:10:15,384 --> 01:10:17,487
Besides, that place
made me a goddamn drunk.

819
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:25,962
Do you remember what we
performed for the opening night?

820
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:29,832
Oh, and thank God
I talked you out

821
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:31,602
of that Marlene Dietrich number.

822
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:36,173
But your Shirley Bassey
routine brought down the house!

823
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:40,843
And you did both,
the Peaches and Herb.

824
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:44,046
- At the same time.
- At the same time.

825
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,316
(both laugh)

826
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:49,818
Girl, you taught me everything
I never wanted to know. (laughs)

827
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:50,988
- (phone ringing)
- (laughs)

828
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,689
- You got a call.
- Oops.

829
01:10:56,192 --> 01:10:57,861
- (sighs)
- (phone beeps)

830
01:10:57,893 --> 01:11:00,897
- One of your boys?
- Lemme tell ya something.

831
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,700
The trade on here,
would make your head spin.

832
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:07,102
- Show me.
- (phone chimes)

833
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:09,540
Ah! (sighs)

834
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:14,311
I do better on here,
than I ever did in the bars.

835
01:11:14,678 --> 01:11:19,916
Yet, here you are,
cruising the tearoom. (laughs)

836
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:24,120
I like to cover my bases.
(laughs)

837
01:11:24,152 --> 01:11:25,955
What on earth?

838
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:32,628
What on earth are they doing?

839
01:11:33,963 --> 01:11:35,866
These daddies with their...

840
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:38,000
- babies.
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:11:38,267 --> 01:11:39,970
(indistinct chatter)

842
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:43,639
I wouldn't even know
how to be gay anymore.

843
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:49,078
Tell that to your pantsuit.
(laughs)

844
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:55,652
- man: Great. Great job, buddy.
- (sighs)

845
01:11:57,253 --> 01:11:59,889
(baby crying)

846
01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:05,329
Pat: I'm happy for them.

847
01:12:06,896 --> 01:12:08,898
Eunice: And jealous as hell.

848
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:11,300
Pat:
Those kids will remember them,

849
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,104
long after they have gone.

850
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:17,707
And who will remember us?

851
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:22,813
- You left a big mark.
- On who?

852
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,948
Those gay dads should
drop to their knees

853
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:27,884
and kiss your rings.

854
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:30,621
Which one?

855
01:12:31,088 --> 01:12:35,258
Especially the cubic zirconia
on your left ring finger.

856
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:39,129
'Cause bitch, you know that's
the only one that's real.

857
01:12:40,028 --> 01:12:43,866
(laughs)

858
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,403
Pat: You evil bitch.

859
01:12:50,205 --> 01:12:52,074
I went to see David today.

860
01:12:54,777 --> 01:12:56,246
Is he still dead?

861
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:01,418
My name was on the tombstone.

862
01:13:02,951 --> 01:13:05,988
Eunice: No shit.
You paid for the damn thing.

863
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:09,191
Today was
the first time I saw it.

864
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:14,031
Don't tell me, you are
still mad at that old whore.

865
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,071
Jesus, honey,
when are you gonna move on?

866
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:29,344
Why didn't you tell me
about my house?

867
01:13:29,378 --> 01:13:32,148
I went there.
There was nothing there.

868
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:39,722
You don't tell someone
in the goddamn nursing home

869
01:13:39,755 --> 01:13:41,691
their house has been demolished.

870
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:43,994
It's bad etiquette.

871
01:13:44,827 --> 01:13:48,064
But you could have come
and said, "Hi."

872
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,836
At least you had a home.

873
01:13:57,072 --> 01:13:58,275
And a David.

874
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:00,477
(chuckles)

875
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:05,849
I had a house, and a David.

876
01:14:06,848 --> 01:14:08,718
And both are gone.

877
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:11,287
But you are here.

878
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:19,262
You're not gone.

879
01:14:22,464 --> 01:14:23,999
(door knocking)

880
01:14:25,468 --> 01:14:26,503
Eunice.

881
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:29,506
(seagulls cawing)

882
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:31,307
Eunice.

883
01:14:37,513 --> 01:14:41,751
And you old bitch,

884
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:46,188

888
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:30,933
Gabriel: How did it go?

889
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,936
- I quit the bitch.
- (chuckles)

890
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:36,039
(exhales)

891
01:15:36,339 --> 01:15:38,441
Frozen fucking pizza lit
the toaster oven on fire.

892
01:15:38,473 --> 01:15:40,175
But I extinguished
the blaze, girl.

893
01:15:40,209 --> 01:15:43,412
- I am here, I am alive!
- And did you select a song?

894
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:46,316
I barely survive
a DiGiorno inferno

895
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:48,384
and you trifle me
for song selection?

896
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:51,153
(scoffs)
Shame on you, Gabriel. Shame.

897
01:15:53,054 --> 01:15:54,523
Is Velma all right?

898
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:59,362
One Coco Roco
and she will be just fine.

899
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:03,465

901
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:16,179
Look like you seen a ghost.

902
01:16:18,147 --> 01:16:20,216
Gabriel sent on me
to check on you.

903
01:16:20,249 --> 01:16:21,418
(exhales)

904
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:25,055
(sighs) I dropped this bitch
on a Crockpot.

905
01:16:25,554 --> 01:16:28,057
It's the last night,
I have no idea what I'm doing.

906
01:16:28,089 --> 01:16:30,125
- (objects clatter)
- Take the edge off.

907
01:16:53,249 --> 01:16:55,452
(exhales) Gorgeous skin.

908
01:16:56,352 --> 01:16:57,554
(exhales)

909
01:17:00,089 --> 01:17:03,026
- Where are you from?
- Hancock Street.

910
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:04,192
- Nice.
- (scoffs)

911
01:17:04,226 --> 01:17:05,428
You been there lately?

912
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:10,567
- Been performing long?
- Two years.

913
01:17:10,832 --> 01:17:14,070
I finally start to get good
and they close the damn bar.

914
01:17:16,405 --> 01:17:17,573
What's your act?

915
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:21,143
Batten down the hatches, boys,

916
01:17:21,443 --> 01:17:27,483
man your harpoons and make way
for Miss Velma Humpback!

917
01:17:27,717 --> 01:17:30,653
- <i>"Thar she blows!"</i>
- Aw, yes, queen. (chuckles)

918
01:17:31,388 --> 01:17:34,424
Forget this little town,
Miss Velma.

919
01:17:34,956 --> 01:17:37,026
You'd be big in Cleveland.

920
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:39,929
(scoffs) Well, ain't you
just the sweetest thing?

921
01:17:42,164 --> 01:17:46,469
(upbeat music playing)

922
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:08,457

1019
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,556
I didn't know
that you looked that bad.

1020
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,493
Well then fix me, goddammit.

1021
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:39,936
When David died,
you didn't come to the funeral.

1022
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,508
And now you want me
to rescue yours?

1023
01:26:47,776 --> 01:26:50,546
Pat, for Christ's sake,
I never even met David.

1024
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:53,515
We talked about him,

1025
01:26:53,715 --> 01:26:58,920
every Friday at 4:00
for 33 years.

1026
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:04,227

I don't do well at funerals.

1027
01:27:05,826 --> 01:27:07,062
Really?

1028
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,032

1029
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:14,036
You're not making this easy,
Patrick.

1030
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:15,871
I'm trying to make this right.

1031
01:27:18,839 --> 01:27:20,642
I know I was your servant...

1032
01:27:22,844 --> 01:27:25,848
but I thought I was your friend.

1033
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:29,051
You knew every
goddamn secret I ever had.

1034
01:27:30,585 --> 01:27:32,787
And you never listened once
to mine.

1035
01:27:33,155 --> 01:27:35,558
It was another world
back then, Pat.

1036
01:27:35,857 --> 01:27:37,893
People evolve, they let go.

1037
01:27:39,894 --> 01:27:41,296
Maybe you should too.

1038
01:27:45,032 --> 01:27:46,736
Have a fun funeral.

1039
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:49,939
I was embarrassed! Okay?

1040
01:27:52,139 --> 01:27:54,110
About how David died.

1041
01:28:01,249 --> 01:28:02,885
When I did let you know...

1042
01:28:04,686 --> 01:28:06,121
how much it hurt...

1043
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:10,693
(sighs)
...that you weren't there.

1044
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:15,764
Because I needed you there
at that moment.

1045
01:28:16,764 --> 01:28:17,767
(sighs)

1046
01:28:18,967 --> 01:28:20,036

1047
01:28:22,269 --> 01:28:25,240
I left you. (sighs)

1048
01:28:25,773 --> 01:28:28,143

01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:12,755
I forgive you.

1055
01:29:17,259 --> 01:29:19,895
You're going to be beautiful.

1056
01:29:20,327 --> 01:29:22,263
I'll make you beautiful.

1057
01:29:23,397 --> 01:29:24,666
Yes.

1058
01:29:55,196 --> 01:29:56,331
(ominous music playing)

1059
01:31:39,534 --> 01:31:42,271
(ominous music
continues playing)

1060
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:21,269
(organ music playing)

1061
01:33:27,976 --> 01:33:29,277
(gasps)

1062
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:44,994
Pat.

1063
01:34:03,445 --> 01:34:04,345
Thank you.

1064
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:11,387
May I share something with you?

1065
01:34:17,192 --> 01:34:21,029
I was 15 when Grandma Rita
sat me down

1066
01:34:21,062 --> 01:34:26,969
and asked me if there was
anything I needed to tell her.

1067
01:34:30,104 --> 01:34:31,406
We were so conservative.

1068
01:34:37,045 --> 01:34:39,048
I was scared to death
to tell her the truth.

1069
01:34:41,616 --> 01:34:43,719
But finally...

1070
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:47,555
I did.

1071
01:34:51,759 --> 01:34:53,528
"Don't worry," she said.

1072
01:34:56,130 --> 01:34:58,133
"My best friend's gay too."

1073
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:05,073
We stayed up all night.

1074
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:10,345
She told me all about
you and David.

1075
01:35:11,179 --> 01:35:13,449
(seagulls cawing)

1076
01:35:21,121 --> 01:35:23,258
Dustin: <i>Even though
I never really knew you...</i>

1077
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:29,630
<i>I want you to know
you changed my life.</i>

1078
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:15,543
(sighs)

1079
01:36:20,548 --> 01:36:23,318
(switch thuds)

1080
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:49,078
(chuckles)

1081
01:37:05,559 --> 01:37:08,763
Eunice: (laughing)
<i>Oh, baby, I missed you.</i>

1082
01:37:08,795 --> 01:37:10,465
David: <i>Hey, mister.</i>

1083
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:17,305
