1
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,758
- What?
- Yo, dog, I ain't going.

2
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,126
I'm getting on that bus.

3
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,327
Now that means
you are getting on that bus.

4
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,937
We look stupid!

5
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,608
Oh, now you want to be
all embarrassed.

6
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,369
You should've
thought about that before.

7
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,409
Dog, I ain't going.

8
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:38,448
Call me dog again and see if I don't
knock you flat on your ass.

9
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:43,486
Now, I'm getting on that bus and you
are going right along with me.

10
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,917
I am your father.

11
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,286
You are my son.

12
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,193
So let's get on the bus, okay?

13
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,796
Walk.

14
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,596
Gary...

15
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,135
...stop looking at me like that.

16
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,441
Shelly, are we cool...

17
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,100
No, we're not cool, and we're not
finished either.

18
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,007
You'll feed Kaya for me?

19
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,674
I'll feed him, walk him and watch him
crap! I'm looking forward to it.

20
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,218
You make it sound like I'm
running off with another woman.

21
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,118
You expect me to get wet like you're
doing something incredible?

22
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,124
This whole thing is sexist and
exclusionary.

23
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,626
Yes!

24
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,460
How would you feel if the march
was only for dark-skinned brothers?

25
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,535
How can Farrakhan call a march for
dark-skinned brothers...

26
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,697
...when Farrakhan's about your
complexion, with straight hair?

27
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,035
Gonna kiss me? Kiss me goodbye?

28
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,235
I'm late for work.

29
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,749
I love you anyway.

30
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,918
Remember to watch CNN.

31
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,389
We're not done talking.

32
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,025
I know we're not.

33
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,144
I'll call from Arkansas.

34
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,572
Looks like they're boarding.

35
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,842
Welcome aboard, welcome aboard.

36
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,485
I'd have hated
being on your plantation.

37
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,987
Runaway slave wouldn't have
stood a chance against you.

38
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:29,651
Court order says I have to keep my son
tethered for 72 hours.

39
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,557
But it's cool.

40
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,527
We're working it out, right?

41
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,168
All right.

42
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,999
Welcome aboard the Spotted Owl.
We're ready to ride into history.

43
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,674
Step right up on in.

44
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:47,505
Come on. Anybody else going to the
Million Man March, get on the bus!

45
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,579
- How you feeling?
- Okay, Pop. You?

46
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,340
Never felt better in my life!

47
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,883
Then give me some of what you got.

48
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,679
How you doing?

49
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,049
Welcome aboard.

50
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,520
Black power, brothers!

51
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,593
Black power.

52
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:04,927
Black power.

53
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:05,961
Black power.

54
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,898
Black power.

55
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,264
Sounds like he's stuck in the '60s.

56
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,702
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it, thank you.

57
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,636
Thank you very much.

58
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,472
My name...

59
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,111
...is Jeremiah Washington.

60
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,212
Jamal.

61
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,815
Glad to meet you, Jamal.

62
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,577
Not much legroom, is there?

63
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,089
I'll have to stretch these bones
every chance I get.

64
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,587
Ain't that the truth?

65
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,590
Them fools back at the barbershop...

66
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:43,568
...they asked me what I hoped to
accomplish by going to the march.

67
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,603
These black men, nagging at me...

68
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,136
What'd you say?

69
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,139
I said I'd be first in line
at the revolution...

70
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,108
...while they'd be
bringing up the rear.

71
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,210
And by the time I return
from Washington...

72
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,284
...my behind's gonna be
20 years younger.

73
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,518
Fountain of youth, huh?

74
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,086
The Miracle at the Mall,
that's what I'm looking for.

75
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,659
And that's what I'll get.

76
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,659
Craig, how's it going?

77
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,332
- Let's roll it.
- We ready to roll, peoples.

78
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,935
If you're going to the Slauson
swap meet, the Brentwood mansion...

79
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:23,131
...or the La Brea Tar Pits,
your black ass is on the wrong bus.

80
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,672
This bad boy is going
to Washington, DC...

81
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,644
...for the Million Man March!

82
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,618
- I'm George, this is Craig.
- Say, fellas.

83
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,120
We'll get you to and from the march
safely, in six days.

84
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,191
- We hope.
- There are some rules we must observe.

85
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,123
One, and this is for you, Pop.

86
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,991
No drinking alcohol while on this bus.

87
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,501
Two, no smoking.

88
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,029
And three...

89
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,967
...most important, and this
I ain't bullshitting about...

90
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,971
...no using or possessing
illegal substances.

91
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,201
There's a bathroom in the back.

92
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,381
I trust that none of you men
are women.

93
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,814
If you are, you're some of the
ugliest broads I ever seen in my life.

94
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,546
Flush the toilet after you use it.
Try not to piss on the seat.

95
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,815
You two gonna have
a problem with that.

96
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,492
He sounds like my mother.

97
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:18,562
For the next 6 days, I am your mother.
Don't make me use my belt.

98
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,822
Mr. Driver?

99
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,991
With your permission, sir,
I think we ought to ask...

100
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,832
...that the Creator
should travel with us.

101
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,667
I got no problem with that.

102
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,275
Any objections?

103
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,675
The floor is yours, Pop.

104
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,279
Bow your heads.

105
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,907
Father God...

106
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,347
...we come to You as pilgrims on a bus
that's bound for glory.

107
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,420
We're not perfect, Lord,
but we seek perfection.

108
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,024
We're not guilt-free,
but we ask for Your forgiveness.

109
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,684
We know You was with Moses
when he parted the Red Sea...

110
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,387
...and freed the slaves.

111
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,766
We know You was with Noah...

112
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,596
...when the rain came down
40 days and 40 nights.

113
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,034
You was with Malcolm in Mecca...

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,708
...with Martin when he went
to the mountaintop.

115
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,311
And we're asking You, dear God,
to be with us now...

116
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,716
...on this historic journey to
fellowship...

117
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,579
...with one million black men.

118
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:18,284
And if there's anything, Lord,
that we need and we pray for...

119
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,458
Hot damn!

120
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,457
Thought y'all was gonna jet
without a brother!

121
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,062
My horoscope said the moon
was aligned for me.

122
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,097
Hey, we're in the middle
of a prayer here.

123
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,493
Oh, oh. My bad.

124
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,265
Y'all go ahead.

125
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,972
And if anything, dear Lord,
that we do need and pray for...

126
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,575
...is that after this trip...

127
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,715
...each and every one of us will
be a better man than he was before.

128
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,445
Amen.

129
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,941
Amen.

130
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,245
You got a ticket?
You better have a ticket.

131
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,855
I made the bus.

132
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,922
What's up?

133
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,289
- Hey, Ben Vereen!
- Ben Vereen's not on the bus.

134
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,330
Let me ask you...

135
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,127
...what would a bus trip be
without James Brown?

136
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,333
Like O.J. without a white girl.

137
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,766
Be a sorry-ass trip.

138
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,373
That's all I needed to hear! Hit me!

139
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,113
Ready?

140
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,046
<i>Papa don't take no mess</i>

141
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,646
<i>Papa don't take no mess</i>

142
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,016
<i>Papa is the man</i>

143
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,556
<i>Who can understand</i>

144
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,891
<i>How a man's got to do</i>

145
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,854
<i>Whatever he can</i>
<i>Hit me!</i>

146
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:25,842
What's up, dog?

147
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,782
I done told you about that "dog" shit.

148
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,191
Don't let me have to take care of you
out here in front of these brothers.

149
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,918
Now turn that mess down.

150
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,892
It's too loud, Junior.

151
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,525
Let me ask you...

152
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,066
...you don't like to be called "dog."

153
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,738
Well, you know, "Dad"...

154
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,934
..."Daddy"...

155
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,200
..."Sir" would be nice.

156
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,707
Take your pick.

157
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,109
Then I should have the right
not to be called Junior.

158
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,380
That's cool. That's cool.

159
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,644
What do you like? Evan?

160
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,479
Hell, no!

161
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,916
Then what?

162
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,791
Smooth.

163
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,119
My homies call me Smooth.

164
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,319
Your homies call you Smooth.

165
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,827
I ain't your homie, okay?

166
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,128
You must be out of your damn mind.

167
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,896
Ain't no way I'm calling my son Smooth.

168
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,574
All of a sudden, I'm your son again?

169
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,266
But I'm the one out of his mind?

170
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,748
You're a Bruins fan, huh?

171
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,248
Yeah, 1995 NCAA champs.

172
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,749
Can't argue with that.

173
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,114
You down with the Bruins?

174
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,288
I went to SC.

175
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,622
Flip Carter. What's happening?

176
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,287
X.

177
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,657
X? Like in, what,
"X marks the spot"?

178
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:50,869
No...

179
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,934
...just X.

180
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,199
I've heard some trippy names
in my life: Ezekial, Cadillac...

181
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,932
...even a brother named Porcupine.

182
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,942
But even if she's in labor
with a bottle in one hand...

183
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,115
...a big fat blunt in the other...

184
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:07,046
...no mother would name her
son a letter of the alphabet.

185
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,949
You're saying your mama named you...

186
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:10,885
...Flip?

187
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,387
Phillip. Flip's my stage name.

188
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,456
I'm what you call a thespian.

189
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,126
My real name's Xavier.

190
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,822
- Xavier Moore.
- That I can get with.

191
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,159
What up, black?

192
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,736
What's up?

193
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,270
I'm doing well. I made the bus.
It's all good now.

194
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,306
Had trouble waking up?

195
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,477
Please, I get up with the roosters.

196
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,077
I had an early audition.

197
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,304
You a singer?

198
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,481
I'm an actor.

199
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,479
You ever been in any movies?

200
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,652
- See <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>?
- You were in that?

201
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:41,683
Almost.

202
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,185
At the last minute they gave it to...

203
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,315
...to Ice Cube.

204
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,685
You believe that?

205
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,022
He's a rapper, not an actor.
They hired a rapper to act.

206
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,823
I can't get behind that.

207
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,833
It's okay, though, because
I just went up for a role opposite...

208
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,504
...Denzel.

209
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,297
That's on the q.t.

210
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,707
What is this, CNN?

211
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,275
Excuse me.

212
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:11,472
Film school. I'm doing a documentary
for my thesis project.

213
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,875
Gary.

214
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,981
Gary what?

215
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,219
Gary Rivers.

216
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,651
How come you're going to the march?

217
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,498
The march. How come you're going?

218
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:36,031
I guess if the brothers are getting
together, talking about things...

219
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,733
...working things out,
I want to be there.

220
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,677
Where are you from?

221
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,705
Pasadena.

222
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,144
No, where are you from?

223
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,342
Monterey, originally.

224
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,150
Right.

225
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,380
I didn't know black people lived there.

226
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,023
We got a handful.

227
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,355
If you don't mind my asking...

228
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,062
...are you mulatto, or just
light-skinned?

229
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,390
You mean biracial?

230
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,860
Biracial?

231
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,027
So that's a yes.

232
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,666
I consider myself black.

233
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,239
If you're raised by at least one
black parent, I guess you're down.

234
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,341
Many brothers were raised
by one parent.

235
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,771
My mother's white.

236
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,741
- No disrespect.
- What's with your pop?

237
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,916
What?

238
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,941
Your father. What's up
with your father?

239
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,383
My father was a black man.

240
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,953
He was a cop. He got murdered.

241
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,027
Must've tripped you out.

242
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,893
Yeah, it tripped me out.

243
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:41,405
Really tripped me out. Just like
having to watch a rapper act.

244
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,871
This brother, man...

245
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,839
- Excuse me.
- Shoot on this side.

246
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,137
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,944
Mind if I ask something?

248
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:49,944
Why quit now?

249
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,016
Was it a brother
that killed your father?

250
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,453
- What kind of question is that?
- I'm just wondering.

251
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,751
Yes, a brother killed my father.

252
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,393
Did you get it?

253
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,764
Did you get it, X?

254
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,198
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

255
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,610
Kyle, you can't just blink your eyes
and expect me to go away.

256
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,414
I know you can hear me.

257
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,250
- Should I just keep talking...
- What's your beef?

258
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:31,255
You think if you pretend to sleep,
I'll forget we were talking?

259
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,015
You always think I'm playing you.

260
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,692
I'm not accusing you.

261
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,192
- I'm asking for clarification.
- I said all I have to say.

262
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:42,356
You can't just wake up one morning
and say you need space...

263
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,365
...and expect it to be case closed.

264
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,630
- After all we've been through?
- Keep your voice down!

265
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,601
I forgot.

266
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,403
We can't let your macho ass
out of the closet.

267
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,042
What do you want me to say?

268
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,307
Anything.

269
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,777
That it's another man, or a woman.

270
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,717
That you're confused about
your sexuality. Anything.

271
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,891
Look, Randall, I need space.

272
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,719
- That's it.
- Not good enough.

273
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,727
If I knew you were gonna trip
on me, I'd have made you stay home.

274
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,455
You've got a lot of nerve.

275
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:19,000
You are not the reason I came on
this trip, you pompous bastard.

276
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,305
Good. Then you won't mind
if I change my seat.

277
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:30,408
I do mind. I mind that you're not
man enough to admit you love me.

278
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,413
- Hold up!
- What?!

279
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,142
- Cool, Dad.
- Oh, Lord.

280
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,322
We're going to the march
with a bunch of homos!

281
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,183
Sissy.

282
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,426
Tell me I didn't just hear
what I think I did.

283
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,686
What?

284
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,164
He said:

285
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,699
"You're not man enough to admit
that you love me," to him.

286
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,095
So?

287
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,293
So?!

288
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,269
We have faggots on the bus.

289
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,339
Gays have no role in our community?

290
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,512
I'm talking about the faggots
we got on this bus.

291
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,543
How else would they get there?

292
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,339
Skip.

293
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,881
Damn straight.

294
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,014
It's no biggie to me.

295
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,451
You bend down
and grab your ankles too?

296
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,181
No, I ain't gay, all right?

297
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,883
I still don't see what the problem is.

298
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,025
Ask them why they're going.

299
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,698
Look, bro. You know what? I will.

300
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,732
The Bible says it's an abomination.

301
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,500
Still...

302
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,873
...sometimes I ask myself
what would I do if...

303
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,132
...one of them...

304
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,832
...was my son?

305
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,704
Or worse, still...

306
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,076
...what if I was the one
that was born that way?

307
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,510
What's your lady's name?

308
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:47,216
- Jindai.
- Oh, she is pretty!

309
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,222
How long you been together?

310
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,228
We been talking for about two years.

311
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,230
Two long years? Two short years?

312
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,333
Two short years.

313
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,596
I met her one day
when I was crossing the street.

314
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,340
Don't tell me you
met this beautiful young lady...

315
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,205
...and you did the "daddy-cool" thing.

316
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,244
In my unenlightened days...

317
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,784
...big booty would catch my eye.

318
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,583
You could say I had "big booty radar."

319
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,589
Son, you ain't in love.
You're in lust.

320
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,058
No, sir. No, sir.

321
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,022
Far beyond that now.

322
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,793
Since we've been together,
we've never really been together.

323
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,428
You kidding me?

324
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,606
No.

325
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,034
We're of the faith.

326
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,606
Living clean, you know?

327
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,276
No shame in that.

00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,525
<i>Has got to stop</i>

357
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,732
Mike, how come you're going
to the march?

358
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,561
I'm thinking this
could be Black Monday.

359
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,739
What do you mean?

360
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,737
This could be a setup.
This could be a conspiracy.

361
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,675
We could be on our way to getting
done, like the trains into Dachau.

362
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,577
- You saying it's a plot?
- It could be, man.

363
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:03,721
Think of all the planes and cars
filled with black men going to DC.

364
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,082
Thousands, right? Thousands.

365
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,418
If I'm a crazy white man
in the government...

366
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,927
...and want to kill a million black
men, just hit one button, and boom?

367
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,928
When and where would I do it?

368
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,760
At the Million Man March.

369
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,199
The next day, when we're all dead,
who'll fight our battle?

370
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:23,863
Nothing but black women left.
Some "holocalyptical" shit going on.

371
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,703
That's what I'm saying.

372
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:30,439
- Jay, you going for the same reason?
- No, I'm going to the march for myself.

373
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:35,211
It's time for us to be responsible,
get out of the beggar mentality...

374
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,285
...to say, "Look out for a brother."

375
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,049
We need to start looking out
for ourselves.

376
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,749
This is a strong black businessman.

377
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,889
- You have a business?
- Yes, I have my own business.

378
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:46,962
Ask him what.

379
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,894
I've been in business 7 years.

380
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,628
- What kind of business?
- I have a black bubblegum company.

381
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,669
- What's it called?
- Yo Bubba.

382
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:56,801
How's business?

383
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:57,838
It's blowing up.

384
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,337
I just don't understand.

385
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,413
Got the girl at private school
her whole life...

386
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,916
...Sunday school,
church every Sunday...

387
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,817
How she gonna come home
with a bun in the oven?

388
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,650
16 frigging years old.

389
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,259
What about the punk got her pregnant?

390
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,951
He's 16 too.

391
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,498
Says he gonna quit school,
get a job and rent an apartment.

392
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,295
Ain't said nothing about no marriage.

393
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:29,330
I tell you, if Farrakhan
has a way to handle this...

394
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,270
...I'd be all ears.

395
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,774
Right now, I want to kill that boy.

396
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,571
Craig! Watch out!

397
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,854
- Everybody okay?
- Call Jacoby & Meyers!

398
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,287
- Can't you drive?
- This isn't a Bronco, is it?

399
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,518
Damn, the engine just cut off.

400
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,219
Is everybody all right?

401
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,631
Damn.

402
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,330
What do you think?

403
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,543
We'll never get out of the ditch.

404
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,302
Now don't be so negative.

405
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,879
Okay, Little Orphan Annie,
the sun'll come out tomorrow.

406
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,711
Haven't you heard the expression
"There's strength in numbers"?

407
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,687
I've been on many ditched buses. I
won't let nothing like that stop me.

408
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,080
Fellas?

409
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,428
I need every able-bodied man
off the bus now! Come on!

410
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,188
- Come on, everybody!
- Gonna mess up my shoes!

411
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,528
We got a little problem.

412
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,363
Get on down there.

413
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,073
Come on.

414
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,243
Everybody!

415
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,911
Ready? One...

416
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,170
...two...

417
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,540
...three!

418
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:52,747
We can't do it.

419
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,118
Can't?

420
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,051
What do you mean, can't?

421
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,760
Look there. When Hannibal
crossed the Alps...

422
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,454
- Who's Hannibal?
- Who's the Alps?

423
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,429
...and saw that he was outnumbered 10-
to-1 by the Roman army, he didn't say:

424
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,105
"Let's go home. We can't do it."

425
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,774
He said, "Get your ass
back on that elephant...

426
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,809
...and stomp them Roman bastards!"

427
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:17,609
There ain't no such words
as "We can't do it."

428
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,478
Let me use 3 other words:
Too damn heavy.

429
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,287
I can't believe you're so shiftless...

430
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,956
...and lazy that you'll just give up.

431
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,058
Oh, he's going to get all
plantation on us now.

432
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,161
"I'm gonna to do it, boss!"

433
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,761
The way you look, I can't blame him.

434
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,490
I thought slavery was over.

435
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,930
It doesn't concern you.

436
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,236
Maybe it does.
Tell us what it's all about.

437
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,808
No, I'm telling you to back off.
That's what I'm telling you.

438
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,243
Hey, everybody, the man's got
a court order. I seen it.

439
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,312
I want to see it.

440
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,485
- Who are you, Richard Roundtree?
- That's all right.

441
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,176
I'd like to see it too.

442
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:03,192
Okay, now, does this
meet with your approval?

443
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,159
Good...

444
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,527
...because I'm gonna
say this one time...

445
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,662
...okay?

446
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,136
Now, this boy right here
has got one father. One.

447
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,872
And that's me.

448
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,839
If you're trying to find
somewhere to stick your noses...

449
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,345
...I got several places I would
love to tell you about.

450
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,346
But whatever you do...

451
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,782
...make sure that it ain't
in my business.

452
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,014
You see, brothers? That's just
what I'm talking about.

453
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,682
The devil don't want the black man
to have atonement.

454
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,793
Right, Pop?

455
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:38,860
Right.

456
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:43,364
But God wants us at that march.
It's our mission.

457
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:44,796
So, on 3...

458
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:49,702
...I want you strong, black African
Mandinka Zulu goddamn warriors...

459
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:54,641
...to lift this damn bus out of that
stupid ditch, and let's be on our way!

460
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,212
To whose tribe
do you belong to anyway?

461
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,747
Shaka Zulu's or Clarence Thomas'?

462
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,975
Shaka Zulu's!

463
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:05,714
Put your back into it! You're all
Mandinka warriors! Lift the bus!

464
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,516
Come on, do it for me!

465
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,427
Pull it up! Go! Go! Pull! Pull!
Come on!

466
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,164
Pull, y'all! That's right, baby!
That's right.

467
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,767
You didn't believe me!
You didn't want to!

468
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,939
Did you see that?
Give me my $10.

469
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,082
Now what?

470
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,845
The devil's kicking
our Mandinkan asses.

471
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,023
Wait. Remember Hannibal, now.

472
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,682
We ain't getting our ass kicked.
We'll get out of this ditch.

473
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,362
You know what this is? A plot.

474
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,224
It's a plot, man!

475
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,597
What's going on?

476
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:54,101
I was putting its pedal to the metal.
The axle must be busted.

477
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,431
Shit.

478
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,074
Let me call base.

479
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,719
- They want me to stay with the bus.
- You know those idiots.

480
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,654
But I'll miss the march.

481
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,994
You know the rules.
What can I do about it?

482
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,427
This is a bitch.

483
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,894
Who's taking my place?

484
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,730
They didn't say. They'll just
send us another bus.

485
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,235
We got another bus coming.

486
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,305
- When?
- I don't know.

487
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:35,172
We won't get stranded on no desert.
Why don't y'all take your shit out?

488
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,680
Gentlemen, please!

489
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,131
Which way? You going back to L.A.?

490
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,180
<i>Out on the road</i>

491
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,874
<i>And the bus broke down</i>

492
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,179
<i>Out on the road</i>

493
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,984
<i>And the bus broke down</i>

494
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,558
<i>Well, it won't be too long</i>

495
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,890
<i>Till I see Farrakhan</i>

496
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,140
You go, Jay. Take it away.

497
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,046
- <i>And it won't be long</i>
- Till what?

498
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,517
<i>Till we're 1 million strong</i>

499
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,755
<i>Well, I was out on the road</i>

500
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,753
<i>And the bus broke down</i>

501
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,094
<i>About 20 of us was</i>
<i>Out on the road</i>

502
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,424
<i>And the bus broke down</i>

503
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,830
<i>Well, I think</i>
<i>They're trying to stop us</i>

504
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,440
<i>But we still DC bound</i>

505
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,706
You guys, here comes...
Hey, here comes the bus!

506
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,879
Y'all didn't believe me.

507
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,523
What's up?

508
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,853
Craig, George, what's all this?

509
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,256
They're going to the march.

510
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,693
The Farrakhan thing? You're kidding.

511
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,026
I'm kidding. They're the
Harlem Globetrotters.

512
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,260
They said a trip to the Capitol.
I should've known.

513
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,768
I guess so. Come on, brothers!

514
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,601
- This is our ride.
- And he's white, fellas.

515
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,277
He gets to go to the march,
I get to stay.

516
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,708
You're kidding, right?

517
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,781
We can't go to no march
with a white boy driving.

518
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,043
What about all that Mandinka stuff?

519
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,780
Used to be we always
had to chauffeur the white man.

520
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,117
This time, he's chauffeuring us.

521
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,418
Right, Pop?

522
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,457
Right.

523
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,559
Come on!

524
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,253
You got anything to stow,
leave it with me.

525
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,836
What's up, Reuben Kinkaid?

526
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,805
You looking for a recording contract,
you come to the wrong place.

527
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,279
What's up?

528
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,614
- Gary.
- Rick.

529
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,329
Not scared or anything, are you?

530
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,259
Of course not. Why, should I be?

531
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,865
Damn right.

532
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,625
They got guns and knives.

533
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,013
I'll be with you guys in spirit!

534
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,979
Freedom now!

535
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,749
We're just getting going, y'all.

536
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,816
Yeah, one million strong.
I can't believe this.

537
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,130
Writing a letter?

538
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,626
This is a prayer I thought I might say
when we arrived at the march...

539
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,329
...thanking the Lord
for all that this means to me.

540
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,940
If we arrive.

541
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:03,179
White boy driving us to the Million
Man March, that's gotta be a bad omen.

542
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,043
What's the deal
with Kunta Kinte there?

543
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:09,611
Brother said for us to stay
out of his business.

544
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,315
I don't care what some judge said, no
way I'd handcuff my son like that.

545
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:15,689
You?

546
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,825
That I cannot say.

547
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,354
No kids?

548
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,031
Oh, yeah, I had...

549
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,164
...two kids.

550
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,191
But not anymore.

551
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,131
That's all over now.

552
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,736
No family at all?

553
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,500
Not anymore.
Jeremiah's strictly on his own.

554
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,832
How do you feel?

555
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,511
Pardon?

556
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,813
You're on a bus...

557
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,848
...with 20 black men.
How do you feel?

558
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,417
Black, white, all the same to me.

559
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,214
I like to think of myself
as colorblind.

560
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,122
Colorblind?

561
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:52,461
So you didn't notice at all that
everyone on this bus is black but you?

562
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:56,727
So-called black men,
descendants of slaves.

563
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,528
Well, we're all
brothers under the skin, right?

564
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,571
Now we're brothers just because
you're on the black bus?

565
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,611
Look, I never wore a white sheet
over my head. I'm Jewish.

566
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,372
God forbid we think a Jew
could be a bigot.

567
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,573
My parents were for civil rights.
Blacks came to our house...

568
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,243
Are you getting this? They actually
had blacks at their house.

569
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,614
I didn't mean it like that.

570
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,256
Oh, spare us.

571
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:24,222
Only two things came out of
the civil rights movement.

572
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,727
One: Black people got a few crumbs.

573
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,298
And two: Condescending whites
could say they struggled with us.

574
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,969
But it didn't end with
the March on Washington.

575
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,570
We're still catching hell.

576
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,070
My people know about catching hell.

577
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,902
My parents did their part.

578
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,409
Their part to make a difference,
or to appear liberal?

579
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,581
Jews made a difference
in the movement.

580
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:48,013
As soon as they got what they wanted,
they abandoned it.

581
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,913
I don't see black people
marching for Jews...

582
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,148
...Hispanics or Asians.

583
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,088
Why do you expect whites
to solve all your problems?

584
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,992
We didn't create our problems.
White people did.

585
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,826
You think we asked for slavery?

586
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:06,765
We asked for the Holocaust?
Six million Jews died.

587
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,872
Doesn't mean we're gonna forget
Nazis, Arabs...

588
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,175
...black anti-Semites...

589
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,607
Do you know how many blacks died
in the slave trade? Over 60 million.

590
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:19,112
I didn't kill them, nor did
my parents. Don't blame us.

591
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,784
Yeah, it's our fault.

592
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,954
After 400 years of slavery
and oppression...

593
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,147
...we're just supposed
to fix everything ourselves?

594
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,622
Damn right, we are.

595
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,386
Who else will do it?

596
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:38,158
Hey, Spike Lee Jr., are you
paying me for this movie?

597
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,398
Then I quit. Get that camera
out of my face.

598
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:45,671
Your name is what? Randall, right?

599
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,905
And correct me if I'm mistaken,
but you are a homosexual?

600
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,374
- Yes.
- And he's Jewish.

601
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,813
That makes both of you
minorities on this bus.

602
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:58,978
Which shows you know nothing about
the civil rights movement...

603
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,159
...because it was about
bringing people together.

604
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,228
So we can stop insulting each other
and deal with the real issue...

605
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,658
...the real oppressor.

606
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,389
I've known him for 5 years.

607
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,503
All he's trying to do is do his job.
Just help us get to the march.

608
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,104
That's all he's doing.

609
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,899
A reasonable man like you
can understand that.

610
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,078
So why don't you cut him some slack?

611
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,247
I don't have a problem with you.

612
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,277
Good.

613
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,915
Thanks, George. I appreciate that.

614
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,847
Yeah, Rick. Listen...

615
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:33,456
...as long as you do your share of the
driving, I have no problem with you.

616
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,052
You're okay in my book, pal.

617
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,463
Yo, dog!

618
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,664
Yo, dog!

619
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,770
What, man?

620
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,907
I gotta use the restroom.

621
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,605
What?

622
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,539
Piss. The bathroom!

623
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,646
If you don't mind,
I'd love to go by myself.

624
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,823
Thanks.

625
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,997
What's happening?

626
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,099
So they liked me?

627
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,833
Yeah, yeah, count on that.

628
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,011
I got my fingers and toes crossed.

629
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,109
Bye. Bye.

630
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,214
Oh, boy!

631
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,284
Did you get it?

632
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:46,195
They're gonna make the decision this
weekend, but it looks like I got it.

633
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,858
Big role?

634
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:53,661
They throw me up on that screen, I'll
blow up too large. People be like:

635
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,339
"Denzel who?"
You know what I'm saying?

636
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,508
I hope it works out.

637
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,677
Then I can say I knew you when.

638
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,505
- "The fool on the bus."
- Right on.

639
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:06,308
Go on your way
to the Million Man March, 1995.

640
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,445
Say...

641
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,117
...what do you think he's thinking?

642
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,457
Mighty whitey, driving the bus.

643
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:19,557
Right now he's probably thinking
about kicking his boss's ass.

644
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,827
You don't have a problem with him.

645
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,471
You got no problem with him
because you share a white thing.

646
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,162
You know what I mean.

647
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,508
I already told you,
I consider myself black.

648
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,640
Hang on. No disrespect, brother.
I didn't...

649
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:38,314
A person is white,
doesn't mean I dislike him.

650
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,644
And just because a person is black
does not mean I like him.

651
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,980
I consider myself black,
just like Bob Marley.

652
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,056
- I'm not talking about him.
- He was mulatto. I'm black.

653
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,719
No disrespect, partner, but I could
consider myself 6'4" and ugly.

654
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,390
The fact remains that I'm 6 foot and
too cute for the English vocabulary.

655
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,593
Wait a minute, Mr. Hollywood.

656
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,396
The man is black.

657
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:04,733
Just let him be.

658
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,068
He's also white!

659
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,973
If this was slavery,
would ole massa care?

660
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,546
He'd be a slave like the rest of us.

661
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,274
He'd be a house slave
in the big house.

662
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,612
While we'd be talking about grits...

663
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,879
...he'd eat potatoes.

664
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,057
He'd have the breast of chicken.

665
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,283
Our women would be blistered
from picking cotton.

666
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,462
His would be bathed, smelling good.

667
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,996
And 9 times out of 10,
the honey he'd hit skins with...

668
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,233
...she'd be a white girl.

669
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,300
Hold it just a minute.

670
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,903
About the grits:

671
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,973
Grits was for the white folks
up in the big house.

672
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,507
Slaves were lucky to get corn mush.

673
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,812
As for hitting the skins
with a white girl...

674
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:47,973
...a black man could get lynched for
just thinking that thought.

675
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,847
- Pop, you know what I mean.
- You are wrong.

676
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,748
Look, my lady's not white.

677
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,086
But you would never
understand that, would you?

678
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,923
What's your problem, really?
Do you want a white woman?

679
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,497
- That's it.
- Is that it?

680
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,430
Please, please!
"Player" is written all over me.

681
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:09,163
I done tagged all kinds of freaks,
black, white...

682
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,274
- Blondes, cripples, crazies.
...Chinese, Mexican.

683
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,707
Why do you insist on
calling women freaks?

684
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,111
I love my woman, okay? I respect her.

685
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,841
She's not a freak. She's a queen.

686
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,610
I bang queens too.

687
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,348
Oh, sorry. I get it.
You're on that henpecked trip.

688
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:32,086
I don't cheat on her. It doesn't make
me a henpeck. It makes me honest.

689
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,594
I wish I could see
how noble you'd be...

690
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,462
...if you had as many drawers
thrown in your face as I do.

691
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,728
Delusions of grandeur.

692
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,337
What's that you said?

693
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,399
Well...

694
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,906
...your constant references
to your sexual prowess...

695
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,307
...are nothing if not
overcompensatory...

696
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:55,918
...and lead me to think that you're a
misogynist who is very insecure.

697
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,554
"Overly-compensatory."

698
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:07,021
Nobody asked you, Harriet Tubman,
Alice Walker, Angela Davis...

699
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,791
...or whatever sister
you think you are.

700
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,331
Randall Royal, if you don't mind.

701
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,527
Well, "Randall Royal,
if you don't mind"...

702
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:18,834
...just because I like pussy,
I like the way it feels...

703
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,741
...I like the way it smells...

704
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,242
...and, on occasion,
like the way it tastes...

705
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,011
...don't make me insecure.

706
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,248
Can you even say the word?

707
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,985
- Pussy.
- I'm looking at one.

708
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,714
Come on. Pussy.

709
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,157
- You want to back off?
- Come on, faggot.

710
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,660
Leave him alone!

711
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,058
Stand by your man!

712
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:50,536
Oh, no, my bad, because actually
you're the man of the relationship.

713
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:54,369
You made your point. Leave him alone.
He wasn't bothering you.

714
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:55,636
He was.

715
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,714
Just the fact that we got
two faggots on the bus...

716
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:00,884
...bothers me.

717
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,144
I won't be too many
more of your "faggots."

718
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,378
Leave him alone.

719
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,921
Mr. Chain Gang in the mix.
"The Defiant Ones."

720
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,523
What's your sign, old man?

721
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,422
"All deliveries in the rear?"

722
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,554
Yo, dog, don't even trip.

723
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,322
"Yo, dog, don't even trip."

724
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,100
Sit down, clown.

725
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,927
Don't trip, dog.

726
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,435
Y'all so serious, brothers.

727
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,858
But a lot of gays think that
Farrakhan is homophobic.

728
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,893
He called for a day of atonement.

729
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,959
Perhaps the minister
will atone for his homophobia.

730
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:26,327
When I go down the street,
white women clutch their purses...

731
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,529
...cross the street like they
would for a straight brother.

732
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,332
I'm going because I'm a black man.

733
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,601
My sexuality doesn't change that.

734
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,845
- Evan Junior.
- Smooth.

735
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,578
Okay, Smooth.

736
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,910
Tell me how come you're going
to the march.

737
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,549
Because he's making me.

738
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,244
He's making you go?

739
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,923
Otherwise you wouldn't be
going at all?

740
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:48,955
Hell, no.

741
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,751
I don't even want to go.

742
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,757
Tell him why.

743
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,760
I'd rather be with my homies.
I got things to do.

744
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,867
That's why I'm taking him. The homies
are just killing each other.

745
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,668
I want to take my son
to this historic event.

746
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,672
I want him to see...

747
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,608
...a million black men doing something
positive for the country.

748
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,009
I served enough for this country.

749
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,118
Ten years in the Marines, fought
in the Persian Gulf...

750
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,719
...I even took a bullet.

751
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:23,326
"Friendly fire" from two homophobic
assholes who suspected that I was gay.

752
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,795
When I woke up, they were laughing
and talking about how...

753
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,056
...they killed two birds
with one stone.

754
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,559
One nigger, one faggot.

755
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:32,861
You care about blacks?

756
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,197
Yeah, I mean, I'm black myself...

757
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,237
You care about other blacks?

758
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,100
Do you steal from black people?

759
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,175
Man...

760
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,306
Steal? I ain't stole from nobody.

761
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,043
Okay, do you take what isn't yours...

762
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,312
...even from black people?

763
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:55,414
- Lf it's just lying around the house?
- Yeah, sure, if it's there.

764
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,527
Right. But you say you care
about black people.

765
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,165
- Don't think I have a right to go?
- I didn't say that.

766
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,599
I just want to know what you think
the gay man's role is...

767
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,466
...in the black community.

768
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,407
What's yours?

769
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,078
Why do you say that
stealing's not wrong?

770
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,939
I didn't say it wasn't wrong.

771
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,983
I'm saying the way I got it,
it wasn't really wrong.

772
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,952
Because I ain't hurt nobody.

773
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,885
Right, so you're saying...

774
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:32,153
...if you take someone's stuff
and don't hurt anyone, it's okay.

775
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:40,800
You're taking it the wrong way.
I ain't taking nobody's stuff.

776
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:44,132
It was there.
The money was there, you know?

777
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,309
Nobody was there.

778
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,172
You'd leave money if you saw it?

779
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,441
If it wasn't mine.

780
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,115
Yeah, okay, that's what you say.

781
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,381
Don't know, man.

782
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,286
- Are we going to eat?
- I think I'm getting a hangnail.

783
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,824
It gives me great pleasure
to welcome you to the Little Rock...

784
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,327
...rest area.

785
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:09,965
Who are you supposed to be?

786
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,635
The welcoming committee
for all the fine sisters.

787
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,531
Oh, please!

788
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,205
You don't recognize me, do you?

789
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,708
I'm an actor.

790
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,775
You played on an episode of <i>Martin</i>!

791
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,215
You were the janitor!

792
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,519
He's famous. You're funny.

793
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,954
Sorry we didn't recognize you.
We've been driving.

794
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,185
- Where are you from?
- Dallas.

795
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,656
I've heard Dallas has fine honeys.

796
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,694
Wait a minute.

797
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:46,836
Aren't you the only two black
cheerleaders on the Dallas Cowboys?

798
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,332
Well, what do you know?

799
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,064
Is he bothering you?

800
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,872
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

801
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,979
Hopefully Minister Farrakhan will
teach him not to bother ladies.

802
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,979
Are you going to the march?

803
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,675
Yes, it's time for the brothers
to work it out.

804
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,411
No, wait a minute. No!

805
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:11,193
How do you brothers propose to work
things out without the sisters?

806
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,723
I've heard this argument.

807
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,059
She's got a point.
It's not right to exclude women.

808
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,328
Especially after all the things
our sisters have done for us.

809
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,301
So why are you going?

810
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,533
Someone's gotta raise the
consciousness of these lost brothers.

811
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:30,509
There are certain questions
which are specific to manhood.

812
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:34,673
Such as, how can we be better
husbands, sons, fathers and...

813
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:36,749
...Iovers?

814
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:41,254
You can start by not trying to put us
womenfolk in our place.

815
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:45,224
Leave the sisters at home
while you work it out? Please!

816
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:50,088
Personally, I'm glad to see
the brothers showing some unity.

817
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,267
Thank you.

818
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,901
That's not unity!

819
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,462
What we need is some solidarity.

820
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,439
You cannot name...

821
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:00,940
...one struggle in black America...

822
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:05,274
...in which the sisters were not
an active force, can you?

823
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,881
I can. Can you?

824
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,450
It's not about excluding sisters.

825
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:13,111
It's about trying
to gain your respect and keep it.

826
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,382
By the way, my name is Gary.

827
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,321
- Gina.
- Nice to meet you.

828
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,492
I'm Jamilia.

829
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,131
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

830
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,960
You know, I wish we could go to DC.

831
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:28,433
Why don't you? I could
help you drive. Follow our bus.

832
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,070
Gentlemen, thank you very much...

833
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,905
...but we do have somewhere
we need to be.

834
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,239
That's too bad.

835
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,711
In that case,
slide me those digits...

836
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,250
...so when it's over I can
run it all down for you.

837
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,648
You don't quit, do you?

838
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,986
This one right here,
can this one be trusted?

839
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,921
I just met the brother.

840
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:54,664
- What about you? Can we trust you?
- Me?

841
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,663
There's no one more trustworthy
than good old Gary.

842
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,802
Just ask his girlfriend.

843
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,762
My, my.

844
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:06,136
No, he's right. Ask her.
She'll tell you I'm very...

845
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:07,439
Trustworthy?

846
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,942
Very trustworthy. Exactly.

847
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:10,977
Let's go.

848
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,511
Well, you know what?

849
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,549
It's been stimulating.

850
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,289
Nice to meet you.

851
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,390
Bye, brothers! God bless!
Keep up the good work!

852
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,220
God bless!

853
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,362
One love, all right?

854
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,222
Hey, watch CNN, all right? CNN.

855
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,198
Get out of here.
You poured salt on my rap.

856
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,166
- Swing and a miss.
- He's out!

857
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:39,305
You're crazy.

858
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,841
- You're crazy.
- Tripping ain't easy.

859
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,475
You're still crazy.

860
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,841
Look at Flip! Brother's jealous!

861
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,145
Mr. "I don't cheat on my girlfriend."

862
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,149
I don't.

863
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:54,290
Please, please, please! You was
salivating all over her.

864
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,286
Oh, come on, James Brown.
You're crazy.

865
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,929
Pop, are you hearing this?!

866
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,995
- I'm hearing this.
- You tell me.

867
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:07,102
What man ain't gonna try to get
something on the side if he can?

868
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,101
Some men wouldn't.

869
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,797
Name one. Better yet, how about you?

870
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:13,600
You ever cheat?

871
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,472
Maybe I did, when I was a youth.

872
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,175
So, Jeremiah was a bullfrog.

873
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,011
And no friend of mine.

874
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,017
"Maybe I did in my youth." That's a
yes. How about you?

875
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,315
I never cheated on my wife.

876
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,624
Technicality!

877
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:32,522
There was a time I was
on this bus with 20 nymphos.

878
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,390
I had to fight them all.

879
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:37,833
But, no, I'm serious.
Let me think about it.

880
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,032
You ain't got to think about it.

881
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,638
I never cheated on my girlfriend.
I like Cathy a lot.

882
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,831
- How old are you?
- 19.

883
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,373
You got plenty of time.

884
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,841
Brother Jamal over there...

885
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,813
...he didn't ever cheat
on his girlfriend.

886
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,984
Course not. He prays 5 times a day!

887
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,154
Get him to pray for music, since
James Brown's on the other bus.

888
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,481
You want music...

889
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,179
...music you got.

890
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,759
We got music that goes
way back yonder.

891
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,493
Is this it?

892
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:10,393
Now I want to introduce you
to my pride and joy.

893
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,194
This is my djembe drum.

894
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,928
What's up, man?

895
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,575
The drum is the mother of all music.

896
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,902
Tell them, Pop!

897
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,102
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

898
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:26,243
I am gonna use this djembe drum...

899
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,477
...to take all you brothers back
to the motherland.

900
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,352
<i>I see a ship</i>

901
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,959
<i>It's a big ship</i>

902
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,062
<i>Ain't no slave ship</i>
<i>I don't see no chains</i>

903
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,855
<i>I don't see no shackles</i>

904
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,693
<i>It's a going-home ship</i>

905
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,630
<i>I cross the ocean</i>

906
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,634
<i>Get off the beaches</i>

907
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,534
<i>I walk in the sand</i>

908
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,367
<i>I step in the grass</i>

909
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,407
<i>Say hello to the python</i>

910
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,475
<i>And the baobab tree</i>

911
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,204
<i>I walk in the jungle</i>

912
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,973
<i>I see the monkey</i>

913
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,650
<i>I see the chimpanzee</i>

914
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,980
<i>I cross the river</i>
<i>I see the crocodile</i>

915
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,982
<i>I come to my village</i>

916
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,489
<i>I see the chief</i>
<i>I see all the elders</i>

917
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,161
<i>I see the warriors</i>

918
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,227
<i>I see the women and the children</i>

919
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,058
<i>I see the fires</i>

920
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,393
<i>I smell the cooking</i>

921
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,570
<i>Hear the singing and drumming</i>

922
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,897
<i>And dance all the dances</i>

923
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,006
<i>I cross the compound</i>

924
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,176
<i>And there at the end</i>

925
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,504
<i>In a little rise</i>

926
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,010
<i>I see home</i>

927
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:33,774
<i>Jeremiah sees home</i>

928
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,881
<i>And they're glad to see me</i>

929
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,454
Pop! Pop!

930
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,630
Get your ass on the bus.

931
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,682
Memphis.

932
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,444
Listen to your mother.

933
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,213
You should listen to your mother.

934
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,721
That's not how I was raised.

935
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,416
That doesn't matter.

936
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,160
What's happening?

937
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,229
Not much, I guess.

938
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,165
Not much is better than nothing.

939
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,171
Can we get some menus?

940
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,438
Sandy, get them some menus.

941
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,141
Let's get something to eat,
then I'll drive for a while.

942
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,076
I need a favor, George.

943
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:43,378
- You can't drive the whole way.
- That's not it.

944
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,655
Base calls, tell them I got sick.

945
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,117
Why?

946
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,816
I'm not coming back.

947
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:51,994
Shit!

948
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,254
What the hell you mean?

949
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:55,328
I can't do it.

950
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,990
Stop bullshitting me. You're just
trying to go to Graceland.

951
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,692
I'd be safer there.

952
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,603
Meaning what?

953
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:06,435
Think we'd put you in boiling water
and eat you for supper?

954
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,305
You already have
the African drums in there.

955
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:14,445
That's the epitome
of cultural disrespect.

956
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,778
I could come back with something...

957
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,818
...anti-Semitic...

958
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,957
Or I could whip your ass.
Which would you prefer?

959
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,557
I'm sorry.

960
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:25,889
All right, here it is.

961
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,964
Maybe I am a little prejudiced,
but no more than you are.

962
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,464
Want me to stay and prove I'm liberal?

963
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,967
I don't have to prove
anything to anybody.

964
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,696
I think affirmative action
has been fucked up.

965
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:42,810
I think O.J. is a cold-blooded murderer
who slaughtered two innocent people.

966
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,310
There it is.

967
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,881
And I bet you wish there were
more white players in the NBA.

968
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,575
Let's just get it out
in the open, huh?

969
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,382
I bet you'd like to call me a nigger.

970
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,048
Or, what do you call it?
A <i>shvartzer,</i> whatever it is?

971
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,125
I'll allow you to say it.

972
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,661
I never called anybody that
in my life.

973
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:06,063
But this bus is going to the Farrakhan
march, and I can't be part of that.

974
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,829
This is not just Farrakhan's march.

975
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,667
He called Judaism a gutter religion.

976
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,740
He said Hitler was a great man.

977
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,243
I wouldn't expect you to drive a bus
to a Ku Klux Klan rally.

978
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,713
So now you're comparing this
to a Klan rally.

979
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,351
Either you'll kick my ass, you'll
cover for me or I'll get fired.

980
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,424
But no way am I getting my
white ass back in that bus.

981
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:32,288
So what's it gonna be?

982
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:36,596
If you feel that way,
you shouldn't get back on the bus.

983
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,463
I'll cover for you, Rick.
See you in L.A.

984
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,965
Thanks, George.

985
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,948
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

986
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:59,212
Sorry, I just never seen this many
people in here before.

987
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,719
Where are y'all from?

988
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:01,913
L.A.

989
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,716
Long way from Los Angeles.

990
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,725
- We're going to the Million Man March.
- No kidding?

991
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,127
- Guess where these fellas are headed?
- Where?

992
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,301
The Million Man March.

993
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,628
No fooling?

994
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,168
That's what they said.

995
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,702
Farrakhan is the new
black leader, huh?

996
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,238
The new black leader?

997
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,410
Like Martin Luther King was.

998
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,805
You could say that.

999
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,673
Not really.

1000
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,348
But he's one of our leaders.

1001
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,081
The only one that could pull this off.

1002
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,186
What about that stuff they say?

1003
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,821
About him thinking the white man
is the devil, that true?

1004
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,583
- Yep.
- No.

1005
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,261
Not really.

1006
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,589
Actually, Farrakhan...

1007
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,823
...is pro-black.

1008
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,934
That doesn't mean he's anti-white
or anything else.

1009
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,662
- I assume you feel the same way?
- Oh, yeah.

1010
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,272
- I'm Rodney.
- Evan.

1011
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,669
- This here's Mitch.
- How you doing, Mitch?

1012
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:54,935
I'm Smooth.

1013
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,510
Evan Junior.

1014
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,112
Just Smooth.

1015
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,339
What's with the handcuffs?

1016
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,778
It's personal.

1017
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,885
I can talk for myself.

1018
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,989
It's a court order.

1019
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:11,921
Judge mandated that I be
in the custody of my father.

1020
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:12,958
A judge?

1021
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,530
It was either community service
and this for 72 hours...

1022
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,031
...or me serving a one-year sentence.

1023
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,566
So, what'd you do?

1024
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,203
I stole something from a grocery.

1025
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,170
Like a candy bar or something?

1026
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,841
No, like money out of
the cash register.

1027
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,744
Damn!

1028
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,377
It wasn't at gunpoint or nothing...

1029
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:38,543
But it was still a boneheaded
thing to do. You know better.

1030
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,313
How do you know what I know?

1031
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:43,890
I know your mother taught you
better than that, okay?

1032
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,687
Yeah, put it off on Moms.

1033
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,430
We'll talk later.
