[dogs barking]

3
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:46,590
[Kyle] Let's get in the car.

4
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,859
[gunshot]

5
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:48,893
Get in the car.

6
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,576
Is he bleeding?

7
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:08,880
Is he dying?

8
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:09,947
- Sarah.
- What?

9
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:10,781
What happened?

10
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,515
What's going on.

11
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,617
Shit, shit.

12
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,089
[Sarah] Hang in there. Reed!

13
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,056
Don't let me die.

14
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,958
[Sarah] He got hit in the side.

15
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,627
You were supposed to
watch him! Goddamn it!

16
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,695
The bullet didn't go
through, there's no exit.

17
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,898
Fucking idiots,
we practiced this.

18
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,732
Shut up, just drive!

19
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,935
How was I supposed
to know he had a gun?

20
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:31,903
Did you kill him?

21
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,971
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:36,173
You shot back at the guy, Reed.

23
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:40,111
What the fuck else
was I supposed to do?

24
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:41,611
We can't go to the hospital.

25
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:42,880
We have to go to
a hospital, Kyle.

26
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,447
He's gonna fucking
die, you asshole.

27
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:45,715
- Rick!
- What?

28
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,084
Turn, turn, turn there.

29
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,890
[Reed] I can't feel my toes.

30
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:55,458
I can't feel my feet.

31
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,797
Look at me, look at me,
Reed, hang in there.

32
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,233
You're not going to die, okay?

33
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,035
You're gonna stay right here.

34
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:06,037
[Rick] Where the
fuck am I going?

35
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,851
What are you doing?

36
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:21,953
Go get them to open the door.

37
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,891
[knock on door]

38
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:27,858
Hello, help!

39
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,596
[knock on door]

40
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,669
May I help you?

41
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,239
One of our friend's
been shot, in the side.

42
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,574
He's bleeding pretty
bad, can you help us?

43
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:46,811
Please.

44
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:53,717
Bring him in.

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:55,953
Bring him in.

46
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,193
[Bee] Come on, get him in here.

47
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,763
Hurry up.

48
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,031
[Kyle] Get him down, get him
down, get him down, come on!

49
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,035
[Kyle] Fucking damn it, come on.

50
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,872
[Bee] Get him down.

51
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,140
The hell happened?

52
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,274
We were hunting it
was getting late,

53
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,276
it was getting dark, we
should've stopped a lot earlier,

54
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,643
but we fucking didn't.

55
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,278
I need to call an ambulance.

56
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:22,146
No, no! Listen ...

57
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,148
He doesn't want to go.

58
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,182
I need to call an ambulance,

59
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:26,117
[Bee] he's bleeding out.

60
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,118
He doesn't have insurance.

61
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:27,985
He doesn't want to go.

62
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,754
Is there anything
else that you can do?

63
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:33,758
I have pliers and string.

64
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,591
Rick, go get the first
aid kit from the trunk.

65
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,259
Yeah.

66
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,132
[music]

67
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,279
[branch snaps]

68
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:02,787
Hello.

69
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,357
Jesus fucking Christ!

70
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,059
Just hold that.

71
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,093
Goddammit!

72
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,763
Shhh. It's gonna be okay, okay?

73
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,137
Where the fuck is Rick?

74
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,039
Goddammit!

75
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:32,216
Rick!

76
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:36,320
Rick!

77
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,667
There is no kit
and Rick is gone.

78
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,402
[Sarah] What?

79
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,837
He's fucking gone, Sarah,

80
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,736
I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

81
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,139
Settle down.

82
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,373
We have to get the bullet out.

83
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,042
Hey, listen to me, buddy.

84
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,009
Listen to me.

85
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,012
[Kyle] Reed. Reed, look at me.

86
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:03,914
This is gonna hurt, okay?

87
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,316
But we're gonna do it, okay?

88
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,354
Ready, on the count of
three: one, two, three.

89
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,329
[Kyle] Oh my God.

90
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,165
Hold still.

91
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,166
Easy, breathe.

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,201
[Kyle] What the fuck.

93
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,369
[Kyle] Oh my God.

94
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:26,237
[Bee] Breathe! Breathe.

95
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,144
[Bee] You have to be still.

96
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,644
[Sarah] All right.
All right. All right.

97
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:49,193
[Kyle] Jesus fucking Christ,
Jesus fucking Christ.

98
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:51,929
Oh God, Oh God. Is he dead?

99
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,364
No, he's fine.

100
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:54,697
Jesus fucking Christ.

101
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:55,332
He's gonna be fine.

102
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,301
Jesus fucking Christ.

103
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,712
[eerie music]

104
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,085
[Rose] Did you let them in?

105
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,254
[eerie music]

106
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,223
He's been shot, Rose.

107
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,297
Who are all you people?

108
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,201
I'm Sarah. This is Kyle.

109
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,036
Look, if we could just
stay here tonight and rest,

110
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,038
we'd be gone by the morning.

111
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,272
We need to wait for
our other friend,

112
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,941
we need to find Rick,
he should be back soon.

113
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,476
Of course, honey,
anything you need.

114
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,879
Do you need to use the
telephone to call someone?

115
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:43,380
No, this will be
best for us to just

116
00:07:43,414 --> 00:07:45,783
stay here tonight, and rest.

117
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,254
Do you think he'll be okay?

118
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,123
Yes, he's gonna be fine.

119
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:56,961
But I would probably get him
to the hospital tomorrow.

120
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,230
Yeah.

121
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,339
Well, y'all must be thirsty.

122
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,950
We can't thank you enough.

123
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,853
My pleasure.

124
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,459
Are you all from around here?

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,029
Yeah, well, not
directly around here,

126
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,965
but around the
area. In the area.

127
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,169
This is a very nice house.

128
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,339
It was my grandfather's.

129
00:08:45,376 --> 00:08:46,510
It's very, uh ...

130
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,281
... classically sleek.

131
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,051
Where's your grandfather now?

132
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:56,453
[glass breaks]

133
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,933
We don't get many guests.

134
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:10,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

135
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:12,870
Um

136
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:17,174
I'm gonna go
outside for a smoke.

137
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,175
I'll go with you.

138
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:24,915
Okay.

139
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,361
You have a very
pretty granddaughter.

140
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,228
I wish I had some
of those genes.

141
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:42,099
That's Rose.

142
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,603
She came to live with
me a little while ago.

143
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,138
I'm not doing so well.

144
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,441
That's nice.

145
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:55,212
You know, the way you
handled yourself earlier

146
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,347
was really good.

147
00:09:58,615 --> 00:09:59,850
I try my best.

148
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,522
You remind me a lot of myself.

149
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,624
You were probably
really a good kid, huh?

150
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,161
Yeah, I was.

151
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:17,368
This is very good.

152
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,170
Thank you.

153
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,142
I've been making that
lemonade my whole life.

154
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,913
My father would walk me
down to the lemon tree

155
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:33,117
that laid on the
property of our land

156
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,087
and we'd pick those lemons

157
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:39,423
and carry them
back into the house

158
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,492
and start squeezing.

159
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:49,233
One day I wanted to go
and he did not want to.

160
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:55,272
And I threw a fit
and he got mad.

161
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,043
So he went in, you know,

162
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,946
to his favorite
chair and sat there,

163
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,218
until he eventually fell asleep,

164
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,121
just right by the window.

165
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,389
It was his favorite chair.

166
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,695
So I decided, being a
little rebellious girl,

167
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,964
that I was gonna go myself,

168
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,467
and I did.

169
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,037
And I really wish I hadn't.

170
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,439
It was a very dangerous thing

171
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,441
for a little girl
to do, you know.

172
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:33,744
So, but I went

173
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:34,611
and, um ...

174
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,584
I wish I hadn't gone.

175
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,021
I regret going.

176
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,228
I wish I had just stayed home.

177
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,734
I don't think I've ever
told anyone that before.

178
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:06,443
I don't think you
hurt your father.

179
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,079
[Sarah] He's probably
proud of you,

180
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,549
making your own decisions.

181
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:18,055
Maybe he was just hurt
you were growing up.

182
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,685
You know what I hate?

183
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,189
What's that?

184
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:58,529
The way nobody has any
manners anymore, so rare.

185
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,601
You have manners though.

186
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,604
Oh, do I?

187
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,643
I can tell a lot about you.

188
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:15,679
Yeah?

189
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,681
Like what?

190
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,118
I know you want to fuck me.

191
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,689
Well, that ain't hard to tell.

192
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:32,830
I know you had a
dog named Beans,

193
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,097
when you were little.

194
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,303
Excuse me?

195
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:44,141
I'm a psychic.

196
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,278
[Rose] Can I see your hand?

197
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,887
Oh!

198
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,720
What?

199
00:13:59,289 --> 00:13:59,891
Uh, it's nothing.

200
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:00,724
[Kyle] What is it?

201
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:01,625
It ...

202
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:02,659
I ...

203
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:03,527
What?

204
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,097
What the fuck did you see?

205
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,870
[laughs]

206
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:15,807
Holy shit, you should've
seen your face.

207
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,208
I was kidding.

208
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:22,546
Jesus, you're easy.

209
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:28,753
Then how did you
know about my dog?

210
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,554
You have a bone key chain,

211
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,889
with Beans written on it.

212
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:36,426
Great.

213
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:39,696
[Kyle] Cool.

214
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:42,666
All right, let's go.

215
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,648
[Sarah] How's everything going?

216
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,515
Fine.

217
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,323
Bee, we're gonna
go check on Reed,

218
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:06,958
we'll be right back.

219
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,692
[Bee] Okay dear.

220
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:21,638
He's breathing.

221
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,407
No fever.

222
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:29,746
You told them our real names.

223
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:30,681
So, they've seen our faces,

224
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,516
what does it matter
what names we tell them?

225
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:37,721
Do you think Rick left?

226
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,257
I think Rick left.

227
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,828
Fucking asshole.

228
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:45,997
Where do you think he went?

229
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,864
Who cares?

230
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,267
Do you think they know?

231
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:52,369
Who, them?

232
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,706
Absolutely not.

233
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:56,573
Why would they?

234
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:04,849
Hey, no, I think they
bought what we were selling.

235
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,818
Right now, this is a
perfect place to hide.

236
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:13,690
Besides, if Reed's
not in any shape,

237
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,293
tomorrow we may have
another day here.

238
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:23,901
Shit!

239
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,537
Battery is dead.

240
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,240
[Kyle] How's your battery?

241
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,611
Mine's almost dead.

242
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,612
And I have no
service here either,

243
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:36,881
like literally nothing.

244
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,455
[Weather Reporter]
Midnight forecast.

245
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,926
Thursday low of 60, high
of 73 with clear skies.

246
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,427
Wednesday low of 62

247
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,729
What is with you and that thing?

248
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:53,865
You watch it all the time.

249
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,669
So, what do you think of them?

250
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,006
Harmless.

251
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,674
Harmless.

252
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,579
Harmless, harmless, harmless.

253
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,619
[TV Reporter] Breaking news
in the Tri-state area tonight.

254
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:17,021
Just hours ago, there
was an attempted

255
00:17:17,054 --> 00:17:19,623
armed robbery at a
local liquor store.

256
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,893
One employee is in
critical condition tonight

257
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:23,895
after an exchange of
gunfire that took place

258
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:25,695
inside the store.

259
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:28,966
Now suspects are at large
and are armed and dangerous.

260
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,434
Police are asking
residents to stay indoors

261
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,104
and lock their
doors and windows.

262
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,807
Without any witnesses,
information on the car

263
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,043
driven by the suspects has
not yet been identified.

264
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,012
Although the armed robbers
were wearing masks,

265
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:44,347
one apparently dropped his
cell phone at the scene.

266
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,851
Police have so far been
able to identify suspects

267
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:49,386
involved through a
slew of text messages,

268
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,620
planning the robbery.

269
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,789
Stay tuned for updates.

270
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,356
This is Gail Scott-
Key reporting.

271
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,892
Please, what are you doing?

272
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,999
[Rose] What are you going to do?

273
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,733
Shoot us?

274
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:06,536
I already told you
you could stay here.

275
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,605
Just don't hurt us, please.

276
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,673
Shut up.

277
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,078
[Kyle] I don't feel bad for you.

278
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:19,917
Who opens her door to a stranger
in the middle of the night?

279
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,823
Are you for real, with this?

280
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:28,993
Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.

281
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,661
That is some secret you're
not sharing with us.

282
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,597
Why don't you come
a little closer

283
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,633
and I'll whisper it
in your fucking ear.

284
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,006
[suspenseful music]

285
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,774
Do I look like a fool to you?

286
00:18:44,976 --> 00:18:46,878
You have three seconds
to put down the knife

287
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,915
or I shoot you and this
old bitch right here.

288
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:56,620
Now, you want to save
your grandmother's life,

289
00:18:56,653 --> 00:19:00,992
then shut the fuck up
and put down the knife.

290
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,672
Good.

291
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:17,741
Now hands up.

292
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,879
Into the living
room one at a time.

293
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:25,649
And when I say one at a time,

294
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:30,687
I mean one fucking
slow and steady time.

295
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,749
[Kyle] Now we're
just going to wait

296
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:04,021
until this blows over.

297
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:14,031
[eerie music]

298
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:34,085
Hey, what the fuck do
you think you're doing?

299
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:35,086
Kyle.

300
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,920
[Kyle] What fuck
the is going on?

301
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,123
I woke up to them
both in the kitchen,

302
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,191
they were talking.

303
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,926
[Kyle] How long
have you been awake?

304
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:44,627
Did you call the cops?

305
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,931
Are they on their way here?

306
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,866
We didn't call anyone.

307
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,568
What were we supposed to do,

308
00:20:51,601 --> 00:20:53,104
lie around until morning?

309
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:54,972
You're the ones
that fell asleep.

310
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,042
[painful scream]

311
00:21:01,045 --> 00:21:03,147
Hey, what's going on with you?

312
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,550
They're lying to us.

313
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,692
No one knows we're here, Kyle.

314
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:16,559
Stop it.

315
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:20,765
We need to hide the car.

316
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,200
Take her with you.

317
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:25,970
I'm not going to try anything.

318
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,046
[Sarah] Let's go.

319
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:43,154
Hey, hey.

320
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:46,357
What?

321
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,292
You don't want them
to find you, do you?

322
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,606
Why didn't you do something?

323
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,607
You had the chance.

324
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,211
What do you mean?

325
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,145
When you were in the kitchen,

326
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:09,346
you could have called the cops,

327
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,115
taking our guns, ran away.

328
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,186
I could've slit your
throats in your sleep.

329
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,155
I thought about it.

330
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,096
Not all of us are monsters.

331
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:28,933
This is your fault.

332
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:31,869
I didn't do this.

333
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,705
If you would have
just stayed put,

334
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:37,607
we wouldn't have to be here.

335
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,252
I'm locking them in the closet.

336
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,190
Well, I could stay awake.

337
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,993
They have pillows,
they have blankets.

338
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,194
They'll be fine.

339
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:00,931
[Sarah] Oh, shit.

340
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,369
Whatever you do,
get rid of them.

341
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:07,071
Do you hear me?

342
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:09,639
Don't do anything stupid or
he will shoot you in the head.

343
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:22,019
[knock on door]

344
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:25,389
[suspenseful music]

345
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:30,294
Answer it.

346
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,134
Good evening, Miss,

347
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:38,735
I'm Detective Lopez.

348
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:41,972
Hello, Officer, is
there something wrong?

349
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,774
Sorry to bother you.

350
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,009
I don't know if you've heard,

351
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,944
but there's been a
robbery in the area.

352
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,379
Right now me and my team were

353
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:50,080
just checking door to door,

354
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:52,983
and just seeing if anyone's
seen anything suspicious.

355
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,154
Intel's led us to believe
that the four suspects

356
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,957
are actually somewhere
in the area still.

357
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:04,061
Have you seen anything
strange tonight?

358
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,232
No, nothing.

359
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,303
I wish I could help.

360
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:14,405
[Detective] Okay well,
again, sorry to bother you.

361
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:17,208
If you see anything
out of the ordinary,

362
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:21,212
make sure to contact
us and don't worry,

363
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,013
we'll catch them.

364
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,248
Have a good night, Officer.

365
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,288
[glass breaks]

366
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,172
My cat, he's terrible,

367
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:50,007
always making a mess.

368
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,874
Good night.

369
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,151
Good work, team.

370
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:04,888
I think it's time for bed.

371
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,244
Maybe we should just leave.

372
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:28,145
Leave?

373
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,314
We can't leave, Kyle,
we're being hunted.

374
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:31,115
We have to stay here.

375
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:32,049
We have to hide.

376
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:32,983
Do you want to go to jail?

377
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,020
I don't like them, Sarah.

378
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:37,921
Now that they're out of
state and out of mind,

379
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,523
I really don't
fucking like them.

380
00:25:39,556 --> 00:25:41,191
Maybe I should have
pointed at another house,

381
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:43,060
that I'm so sorry for not
accommodating your preference

382

of household family.

383
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:47,998
Hey, look, now I know
this is my stupid fault,

384
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,301
and I'm sorry,

385
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:55,072
but I got you and I'm
not gonna let anything

386
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,307
bad happen to you.

387
00:26:00,611 --> 00:26:04,014

best big brother.

[Sarah] Hey!

396
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,037
What is going on with you?

397
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,474
[Kyle] There was a...

398
00:29:53,277 --> 00:29:54,111
What?

399
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:56,346
There was...

400
00:29:58,515 --> 00:29:59,516
You're scaring me.

401
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:03,821
The banging...

402
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,558
There was banging.

403
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,694
And you were gone.

404
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,064
It was terrible.

405
00:30:14,866 --> 00:30:16,500
What do you mean I was gone,

406
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,201
I've been asleep right next
to you this whole time.

407
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,839
Your face

408
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:27,845
was cut off.

00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,383
Hey, you need to
hold it together.

410
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,089
I swear to God, Sarah,
it felt so real.

411
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,595
I was walking on
my own two legs,

412
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:52,102
and the noises woke me up.

413
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:58,709
Maybe you were just
sleepwalking or something.

414
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:02,379
I have never
sleepwalked in my life.

415
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,617
Stress can cause a
lot of strange things.

416

[Rose] He's fine.

420
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,701
Can I use the bathroom upstairs?

421
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,369
At least put on some deodorant.

I smell like a
Goddamn lumberjack.

Did you hear that?

424
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,817
She has to use the bathroom.

425
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,856
And if she's not
back in two minutes,

426
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:27,759
I'm gonna kill you.

You've been shot.

Are they after us?

00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:13,771
[Sarah] Yeah, they know.

00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:15,773
They know what?

435
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:16,808
They know who we are,

[TV Reporter] The liquor
store employee now identified

438
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,619
as 29 year-old, Michael Kuvan,

439
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:31,789

in critical condition,

440

during the attempted robbery.

are still at large,

armed and dangerous.

Where's the money?

448
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:58,481
Did we get the money?

449
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:08,092
The giant sack of money
from the safe. Where is it?

450
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:20,872
Are you telling me
we did all of this

451
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,007
for fucking nothing.

452
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:29,981

killed someone for nothing.

shot for nothing.

who stitched you up.

459

And if it weren't for
her, you'd be dead.

getting long enough.

her go upstairs at all.

00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:15,286
Is this because...

512
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,321
You didn't have to murder her.

513
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,323
You took it too far,

of the work for once?

00:48:56,586 --> 00:48:58,522
Do you have any fucking food?

551
00:48:58,555 --> 00:48:59,523
No.

552
00:48:59,556 --> 00:49:00,758
Well then, what do you eat?

553
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:01,859
I've never seen a
kitchen so bare.

554
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:04,461
You don't have a piece of
fucking bread in there?

555
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:08,398
What do you think, Kyle?

556
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:10,701
He doesn't like me very much.

557
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:13,670
Yeah, I don't remember
asking you a Goddamn thing.

558
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:15,706
I read his palm last night,

559
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:16,707
he didn't like it.

560
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:19,409
Of course you did.

561
00:49:19,443 --> 00:49:20,945
You know, how did you
morons manage to pick

562
00:49:20,978 --> 00:49:23,747
the one house with the
biggest fucking weirdo in it?

563
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:29,821
I can see the future.
I can see the past.

564
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:33,256
I can read yours if you like.

565
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,859
No. Thank you.

566
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:38,395
You know what, why
don't you just shut up

567
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:40,865
and stop whatever it is
you're doing over there.

568
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:48,973
Hey.

569
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,846
Hey, cut it out you creep.

570
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:55,880
Hey!

571
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,514
Hey!

572
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:59,716
[eerie music]

573
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,853
You're all going to die tonight.

574
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,792
[Kyle] I know what
it looks like.

575
00:50:08,993 --> 00:50:12,362
A couple of crazies
come into your house

576
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,899
and kill your grandmother.

577
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:18,970
And here you are an
innocent, sweet young girl

578
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:21,404
who will be saved.

579
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:23,673
That's the way it's
got to seem, huh?

580
00:50:23,707 --> 00:50:25,076
Isn't it?

581
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:29,579
Well, I know what is going on,

582
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,516
I can feel it.

583
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:35,585
And it is some dark, dark shit.

584
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:39,090
Jesus Christ, man,

585
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,391
what are you blabbering about?

586
00:50:41,424 --> 00:50:43,795
Holy shit, let's not
lose our minds now, man.

587
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:47,531
[Kyle] I'm not losing my mind,

588
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:50,802
I'm thinking perfectly straight.

589
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,877
She's just a girl,
Kyle. All right.

590
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:01,578
This is just a
house, we're the same

591
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:02,780
as we were yesterday.

592
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:04,081
It's the pressure.

593
00:51:04,115 --> 00:51:06,349
The pressure will
make you crack.

594
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:09,319
Now pull yourself the fuck
back together, my friend.

595
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:18,728
Where's Sarah?

596
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:22,967
Watch her.

597
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:31,943
You know, some people make
up their own nightmares

598
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:34,846
to distract them
from the real ones.

599
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:35,913
Don't move.

600
00:51:38,883 --> 00:51:40,818
I told you to watch her.

601
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:43,020
Look, I'm not crazy.

602
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:45,890
There's something
going on in this house.

603
00:51:45,923 --> 00:51:48,159
Now I don't know
if it's the house

604
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:50,594
or the old woman or this girl,

605
00:51:50,627 --> 00:51:51,863
but something is going on,

606
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,764
and I know you feel it too.

607
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:55,900
We have to go.

608
00:51:58,002 --> 00:52:01,873
They are not who
they say they are.

609
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:35,266
We're leaving.

610
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:36,834
We have to get out of here.

611
00:53:36,867 --> 00:53:38,601
- When?
- Now.

612
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:39,236
[Reed] Right now.

613
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,204
[Kyle] No.

614
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:41,638
[Reed] What do you mean, no?

615
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:43,040
[Kyle] It's not safe.

616
00:53:43,074 --> 00:53:44,075
He's right.

617
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:44,942
[Reed] Oh, I'm sorry.

618
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:46,043
Do you guys need
more time having fun

619
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:48,578
exploring the fucking house.

620
00:53:48,611 --> 00:53:50,047
I don't mind if you leave now.

621
00:53:50,081 --> 00:53:50,982
Shut up.

622
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:52,216
Kyle is right though, Reed.

623
00:53:52,249 --> 00:53:53,884
It's too dangerous
in the daylight.

624
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,724
Okay, fine.

625
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:02,659
Sundown.

626
00:54:03,828 --> 00:54:04,829
[Reed] But when the night falls

627
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:06,496
we had straight for the border.

628
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:08,065
[Sarah] Sundown.

629
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:12,970
[Sarah] Are you good?

630
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:15,039
Yeah, I'm just great.

631
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:17,842
[Kyle] This is not a good idea.

632
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:18,675
[Sarah] Why not?

633
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,676
It's too dangerous.

634
00:54:19,709 --> 00:54:21,678
Even if we leave
now or daylight.

635
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,082
We don't really have
a choice now do we?

636
00:54:25,116 --> 00:54:26,150
The longer we stay here,

637
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:27,818
the more they close in on us.

638
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:30,121
We have to make a
run for it tonight.

639
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:32,957
In what car, Reed?

640
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,159
They know the car we drive.

641
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:39,596
[Reed] Where's your car?

642
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:40,697
We don't have one.

643
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,233
[Reed] Well, our car it is then.

644
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:46,703
We leave at sundown.

645
00:54:48,873 --> 00:54:49,907
Tonight is the night.

646
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:56,881
You're just afraid of your
wound getting infected.

647
00:54:56,914 --> 00:55:01,218
Don't put us in danger due
to your personal interests.

648
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:13,330
After all we've
been through, Kyle.

649
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,099
You're like a brother to me.

650
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,867
Thought we were a team.

651
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:18,202
We always were a team, Reed,

652
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,669
just not a very good one.

653
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:22,239
Oh yeah.

654
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:24,241
We're leaving tonight.

655
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:25,776
Sarah and I already
decided on it.

656
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,245
So why don't you stop
being such a pussy?

657
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:35,652
You know what's coming, Kyle.

658
00:55:37,054 --> 00:55:40,124
She will be our downfall
if we don't get rid of her.

659
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:41,092
We need all the time we can get,

660
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:43,726
and she's certainly not
gonna help with that.

661
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:46,130
We're already in too deep.

662
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:49,266
I have to get rid of
her before we leave.

663
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,135
And don't tell your sister,

664
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,771
she's not gonna like that idea.

665
00:55:53,804 --> 00:55:55,239
Well, you're going to
have a hard time leaving

666
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,373
without the keys.

667
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:07,218
Do you think they'll come back?

668
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:08,385
Who, the cops?

669
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:09,253
Yes.

670
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:12,156
I don't know, maybe.

671
00:56:13,124 --> 00:56:15,025
Probably not.

672
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:15,893
Oh ...

673
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:19,797
We're leaving tonight
though, don't worry.

674
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:31,108
Do you believe in God?

675
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:32,176
Yeah.

676
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:36,147
Yeah, I do.

677
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,183
It's good to believe in
something, to have faith.

678
00:56:45,256 --> 00:56:46,656
Do you believe in the devil?

679
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:53,964
I've, um, never really
thought about it.

680
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:56,333
Well, if there's good,
there must be evil, right?

681
00:56:57,268 --> 00:57:00,905
Night and day, light and dark.

682
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,175
I suppose he's real too.

683
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:07,311
Oh, he is,

684
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:12,883
and he's not some red monster
with horns and a tail.

685
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:16,287
He could be the most
alluring creature

686
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,354
you've ever met.

687
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:19,689
But people forget,

688
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,929
he's just a wicked
manipulative angel,

689
00:57:26,096 --> 00:57:28,165
and he used to be God's dearest.

690
00:57:31,335 --> 00:57:33,003
You, you've got to talk to him,

691
00:57:33,037 --> 00:57:34,737
he's out of his Goddamn mind.

692
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:35,372
I'll talk to him.

693
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:36,840
You want to know what?

694
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:38,809
I don't care if you
do, or if you don't,

695
00:57:38,842 --> 00:57:40,244
I'm getting out of here tonight.

696
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:44,081
[Reed] Go check on the car
and make sure it's good to go.

697
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:48,152
When the night falls, I want
to leave, immediately, got it?

698
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:49,019
Yeah.

699
00:57:56,961 --> 00:57:58,395
How are things going in here?

700
00:57:58,429 --> 00:57:59,263
Fine.

701
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,444
Hey, so what's
going on with you?

702
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:16,180
We have to get
out of here, Kyle.

703
00:58:16,213 --> 00:58:17,915
We have to leave tonight.

704
00:58:23,254 --> 00:58:24,555
[Kyle] I don't agree with that.

705
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,789
Why?

706
00:58:25,823 --> 00:58:26,523
When do you want to leave then?

707
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:28,092
When would be a better time?

708
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:30,394
It's not safe.

709
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:33,897
Where?

710
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:34,865
What's not safe?

711
00:58:38,068 --> 00:58:41,372
Out there, in the world.

712
00:58:44,475 --> 00:58:46,043
Ever since we got here,

713
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:47,278
you've been acting so strange,

714
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:48,279
but listen, I don't
care about any of that

715
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:49,513
because I love you.

716
00:58:51,048 --> 00:58:52,850
We've always stuck
together, our whole lives.

717
00:58:52,883 --> 00:58:55,085
Please, don't leave
me hanging now.

718
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:03,127
I don't trust
Reed, I never have.

719
00:59:05,896 --> 00:59:08,332
You're really concerning
me, you know that?

720
00:59:33,023 --> 00:59:34,458
Yeah, whatever, um ..

721
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:38,195
we'll leave tonight.

722
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:24,501
Kyle.

723
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:27,971
Yeah.

724
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:32,376
Last night after I found you

725
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:33,377
in the middle of the night

726
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,412
after your dream,

727
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,182
I couldn't sleep.

728
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:42,319
There's something
strange about this place.

729
01:01:43,353 --> 01:01:45,622
I told you.

730
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:48,258
I was trying to stay awake,

731
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:49,693
I thought about
when we were kids

732
01:01:51,195 --> 01:01:52,496
and how you were
always there for me.

733
01:01:52,529 --> 01:01:54,431
And even though we
don't always act like it

734
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:59,636
or say it out loud, most of
the time, I know you love me.

735
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:03,540
And why does that matter?

736
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:06,543
I just wanted to share
that with you, Kyle.

737
01:02:06,577 --> 01:02:08,512
I don't know, I thought
you should know.

738
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:11,615
You wanted to share.

739
01:02:13,785 --> 01:02:14,618
Yeah?

740
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:21,191
I am tired of you
screwing up everything.

741
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:27,531
My whole life I had to
clean up your messes.

742
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,201
I'm ... I'm not.

743
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:33,637
But, I'm under a lot of stress.

744
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,473
And do you know what
stress does to your body?

745
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:40,611
It fucks with your mind.

746
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:45,649
Do you know how hard it is to
concentrate on this situation?

747
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,218
I understand that, but...

748
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:50,053
But, but, but, what?

749
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:54,458
Huh, it's time you grew up.

750
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:57,694
This is not my fault,
this isn't Reed's fault,

751
01:02:57,728 --> 01:02:59,797
this isn't Rick's fault.

752
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:01,732
This is your fault.

753
01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:04,601
And now you have
to let me finish

754
01:03:04,635 --> 01:03:05,435
what we've started.

755
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:07,070
I'm not blaming
you for anything.

756
01:03:07,104 --> 01:03:09,640
I trusted you, I
never blamed you.

757
01:03:09,673 --> 01:03:11,308
You love to blame me.

758
01:03:11,341 --> 01:03:13,577
We needed the money,
Kyle, you know this.

759
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:15,245
It was the only way
to get the money fast.

760
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:16,613
Mom needs the money.

761
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:21,251
[eerie music]

762
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:32,095
Mom is going to die,

763
01:03:32,129 --> 01:03:34,565
whether we can afford
her treatments or not.

764
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:49,546
[Sarah] Guys, we have a problem.

765
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:50,714
The car hardly has any gas,
we're not gonna make it.

766
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:53,417
Yeah, I know what that means.

767
01:03:57,688 --> 01:04:01,558
Well, now we have to get gas

768
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,493
before we go, like now.

769
01:04:03,527 --> 01:04:05,830
And how do you
suppose to do that?

770
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:07,631
We are all over the news.

771
01:04:07,664 --> 01:04:09,399
They've seen our faces.

772
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:10,734
We will bring, her.

773
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:18,375
She will go to the gas station,

774
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:20,444
fill up the car and drive back

775
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:22,512
and I will be laying
in the back seat,

776
01:04:22,546 --> 01:04:24,581
making sure she
does exactly that.

777
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:27,584
Let's go.

778
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:28,619
Kyle, give me money.

779
01:04:28,652 --> 01:04:30,187
I don't have any.

780
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,555
Here, use my card.

781
01:04:31,588 --> 01:04:33,457
What do you mean, you
don't have any money?

782
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,425
Why don't you use her card?

783
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:37,160
I dropped my wallet in the safe.

784
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:39,196
You know what?

785
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:40,631
We would have plenty of money

786
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:43,801
if you're dumb ass didn't
forget the fucking bag.

787
01:04:45,937 --> 01:04:49,640
You have nothing.

788
01:04:49,673 --> 01:04:54,378
You have absolutely
nothing, Reed.

789
01:04:54,411 --> 01:04:56,781
[Kyle] You are nothing.

790
01:04:56,814 --> 01:05:00,283
This is why you dragged me
and her into this bullshit.

791
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:02,386
I should have known better.

792
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:03,520
Fuck you.

793
01:05:03,553 --> 01:05:04,354
Hey.

794
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:05,489
No, fuck you!

795
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:06,657
Reed, stop.

796
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:10,795
No, I get it, he's your brother.

797
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:12,663
You love him, you
trust him, right?

798
01:05:12,696 --> 01:05:14,698
And I'm just the
asshole with the gun?

799
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:18,836
Well, why don't you go
ahead and tell her Kyle.

800
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,771
Tell me what?

801
01:05:19,804 --> 01:05:20,704
[Kyle] Stop it.

802
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:21,839
What he was planning on doing

803
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:23,473
with his portion of the money.

804
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:24,876
Shut up!

805
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:26,243
What did he tell you?

806
01:05:27,377 --> 01:05:29,646
That he was gonna use
it for your mommy?

807
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,616
That that was the
point of all of this?

808
01:05:32,649 --> 01:05:34,819
It was out of love,
for your family.

809
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:39,523
Well, he was never going
to use it for that.

810
01:05:43,293 --> 01:05:45,897
You want to know what
he was gonna use it for?

811
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:49,499
A plane ticket to Florida
and a brand-new pad.

812
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:54,872
And, of course, lots
and lots of drugs.

813
01:05:56,573 --> 01:05:57,741
Isn't that right, Kyle?

814
01:06:04,782 --> 01:06:08,685
[Sarah] You said that we
were doing this for mom.

815
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,755
You said that this was
supposed to be simple,

816
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:13,590
and that no one
was gonna get hurt.

817
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,929
I would have never
gotten involved in this,

818
01:06:19,563 --> 01:06:20,464
and you know that.

819
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:23,801
You lied.

820
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,639
Kyle? Is this true?

821
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:46,858
Now you have nothing too.

822
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:55,833
Go ahead, do it.

823
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,815
All these secrets people have,

824
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,317
always been more
about what they hide

825
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:15,853
than what they show.

826
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,067
You know, I've been thinking,

827
01:07:31,701 --> 01:07:33,938
you remind me of an
ex-girlfriend I once had.

828
01:07:36,107 --> 01:07:38,308
You're a good girl,
you know that, right?

829
01:07:39,877 --> 01:07:41,511
Pretty girl.

830
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:42,980
Very pretty girl.

831
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:48,518
Maybe I've been too hard on you.

832
01:07:49,854 --> 01:07:52,056
Maybe I should have
been nicer to you.

833
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:57,627
I still catch myself
thinking about it,

834
01:07:57,661 --> 01:08:00,564
how I should've let
you keep on dancing.

835
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:05,770
I know you want me.

836
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:08,672
I know you wanted me
to see you dancing

837
01:08:08,705 --> 01:08:09,874
half naked up there.

838
01:08:11,741 --> 01:08:14,812
The way you didn't care
that I was watching

839
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:15,913
and the way you didn't care

840
01:08:15,947 --> 01:08:18,015
that I could have killed
you right then and there.

841
01:08:22,485 --> 01:08:24,688
What was I doing
up there anyways?

842
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:27,624
It's like you ...

843
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:31,728
It's like you called me
up there or something.

844
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,501
Anyways, what I'm
getting at is, uh,

845
01:08:41,438 --> 01:08:44,008
we might have time for
a quick motel stop.

846
01:08:49,746 --> 01:08:54,751
[music]

847
01:08:59,156 --> 01:09:03,393
[music]

848
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:34,091
All we gotta do is fill her
up, and we're good to go.

849
01:09:42,499 --> 01:09:43,700
What the...

850
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:44,969
Pull over to the
side of the road.

851
01:09:45,002 --> 01:09:46,971
Did we seriously
just run out of gas?

852
01:09:47,004 --> 01:09:48,940
God! Pull over.

853
01:09:48,973 --> 01:09:50,740
Son of a bitch!

854
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:52,076
Fucking piece of shit!

855
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:56,713
What are we gonna do now?

856
01:09:56,746 --> 01:09:59,016
We have to get back to the
house before someone sees us.

857
01:09:59,050 --> 01:09:59,984
Sees you.

858
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:01,986
Did you do this?

859
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:03,254
Are you trying to sabotage us?

860
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:05,256
How would I have had a
chance to get to the car

861
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:07,058
without any of you seeing.

862
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:16,801
What the fuck are
we gonna do now?

863
01:10:18,102 --> 01:10:19,136
Shit.

864
01:10:24,075 --> 01:10:25,076
Shit.

865
01:10:25,109 --> 01:10:26,010
All right, okay,

866
01:10:26,043 --> 01:10:27,211
this is what we're gonna do.

867
01:10:27,244 --> 01:10:28,645
Maybe they don't know me.

868
01:10:28,678 --> 01:10:29,746
Maybe they didn't
watch the news.

869
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,049
We can just hitch a ride
and get back to the house.

870
01:10:32,984 --> 01:10:34,185
Maybe.

871
01:10:34,218 --> 01:10:35,618
Listen, I will do the
talking, all right?

872
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:37,021
Don't say a fucking
word, do you hear me?

873
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:38,956
Do not open your fucking mouth.

874
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:42,994
[Reed] Hey there.

875
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,627
You need some help?

876
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:46,063
We're just having
some car trouble.

877
01:10:46,097 --> 01:10:47,131
We live a couple of
miles up the road.

878
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:49,133
So we're just walking back.

879
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:51,701
I could give you a
ride if you want.

880
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:54,171
Yeah, sure.

881
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:55,705
Thanks.
Get in.

882
01:11:01,879 --> 01:11:03,881
[music]

883
01:11:08,052 --> 01:11:10,321
[Reed] Hey, thanks again
for the ride, uh ...

884
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,756
Marshall.

885
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:14,992
Hey, no problem, I'm
not in any rush today.

886
01:11:16,827 --> 01:11:18,329
[Marshall] So where
are you coming from?

887
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,164
Just a couple of
miles up the road.

888
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:21,598
Yeah?

889
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:23,566
I've never seen
you around before.

890
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,069
Did you just move here?

891
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:27,004
He is my boyfriend. We're
taking the next big step

892
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,205
and moving in together.

893
01:11:30,107 --> 01:11:32,877
I've been there a
couple of times.

894
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:33,743
Never again.

895
01:11:35,012 --> 01:11:36,147
Staying single forever.

896
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,989
Hey, you know, my girlfriend's
brother is a mechanic.

897
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:47,224
I can give him a call.

898
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:52,863
No, actually her
dad is a mechanic.

899
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:54,165
He lives around here.

900
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:56,200
So, we're just going to
give him a call, thanks.

901
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:58,102
[Marshall] I was just offering.

902
01:11:58,135 --> 01:11:59,736
I hope it's nothing major.

903
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,571
By the way, be careful outside,

904
01:12:02,705 --> 01:12:05,176
there's a lot of cops around,

905
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:06,310
it's been in the news.

906
01:12:07,677 --> 01:12:08,879
What news?

907
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:12,083
A few guys robbed
a store and fled

908
01:12:13,184 --> 01:12:17,254
and it's just
crawling with cops.

909
01:12:18,355 --> 01:12:20,024
Oh, wow, geez.

910
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:23,127
We haven't been
home much today so.

911
01:12:24,762 --> 01:12:27,131
I'm sure they're
gonna catch them.

912
01:12:27,164 --> 01:12:31,102
Yeah well, we will have
to keep our eyes peeled.

913
01:12:31,135 --> 01:12:32,203
Scary.

914
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:33,037
[Reporter] We interrupt
this broadcast

915
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:34,205
with an emergency alert.

916
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:37,775
Authorities are in lookout
for a silver two door sedan,

917
01:12:37,808 --> 01:12:38,409
license plate number J eight...

918
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:39,276
[radio clicks off]

919
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:48,219
And the radio, that's
all they do, is talk now.

920
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:50,720
They should stick to
just playing music.

921
01:12:50,753 --> 01:12:52,022
And their commercials,

922
01:12:52,056 --> 01:12:53,723
I don't listen to
them anyway, ever.

923
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:01,298
By the way, what's
the make of your car?

924
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:04,969
I think I had a similar one.

925
01:13:05,002 --> 01:13:07,238
Say what, it's a
pretty good car.

926
01:13:07,271 --> 01:13:09,173
Oh, you know what?

927
01:13:09,206 --> 01:13:10,407
[Reed] What are you doing?

928
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,910
I just gotta make a call,

929
01:13:12,943 --> 01:13:14,411
I'll just be a moment,

930
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,348
you just sit tight.

931
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:20,784
Don't fucking move.

932
01:13:27,258 --> 01:13:28,993
Listen, look, man,

933
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:30,261
there's no need
to call the cops.

934
01:13:30,294 --> 01:13:31,128
Back off.

935
01:13:32,997 --> 01:13:34,031
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

936
01:13:34,064 --> 01:13:35,199
Look, I'll turn myself in.

937
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:36,433
I'm ready to do it.

938
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:38,701
I never hurt anyone,
I'm just embarrassed.

939
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,274
Okay, okay, okay, okay,

940
01:13:43,307 --> 01:13:44,308
look, I'll turn myself in.

941
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:45,242
You're right, all right.

942
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:46,709
I'm ready to do it just...

943
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:49,980
Please, man, all right.

944
01:13:50,014 --> 01:13:52,416
Let me do it with some
dignity, all right.

945
01:13:52,449 --> 01:13:53,750
Let me turn myself in.

946
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:55,186
All right.

947
01:13:55,219 --> 01:13:56,753
I'm just afraid.

948
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:59,456
[music]

949
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,435
I had a thought this morning.

950
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:54,305
Something I want you to hear,

951
01:15:54,338 --> 01:15:55,472
I just don't know how to say it,

952
01:15:55,506 --> 01:15:57,174
so I'm gonna say it out loud.

953
01:16:02,313 --> 01:16:06,950
I hope to God that mom
dies before she ever

954
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:08,452
finds out what
we've gotten into.

955
01:16:14,658 --> 01:16:16,460
There's two sides to a person,

956
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:19,997
one is like a friend,
someone you love,

957
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,835
and the other side is
a complete stranger.

958
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:31,342
I'm sorry for lying to you.

959
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:34,912
I know it doesn't matter now,

960
01:16:34,945 --> 01:16:39,550
but I'm sorry for
hurting you and mom.

961
01:16:42,653 --> 01:16:44,521
Whether you believe me or not,

962
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:50,461
I was going to use some of
the money for mom's treatment,

963
01:16:53,364 --> 01:16:55,866
just not all of it,
like we talked about.

964
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,537
I'm sorry, Sarah.

965
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:09,413
Our whole lives I should have
been a better brother to you.

966
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:21,024
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

967
01:17:32,703 --> 01:17:34,438
What was that?

968
01:17:34,471 --> 01:17:35,372
What was what?

969
01:17:35,406 --> 01:17:37,941
That noise, didn't you hear it?

970
01:17:37,975 --> 01:17:39,977
I didn't hear anything, Kyle.

971
01:17:42,513 --> 01:17:44,415
It's like a banging.

972
01:17:44,448 --> 01:17:46,049
There's a banging noise.

973
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:46,984
How can you not hear it?

974
01:17:47,017 --> 01:17:49,119
It's like some type of clatter.

975
01:17:49,153 --> 01:17:52,156
[suspenseful music]

976
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:18,382
Your mother always loved
Sarah more than you.

977
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:21,418
[laughs maniacally]

978
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:25,155
I know this because she told me.

979
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:31,495
Don't take her from here,

980
01:18:31,528 --> 01:18:33,163
she needs me here.

981
01:18:33,798 --> 01:18:35,265
Don't take her.

982
01:19:45,469 --> 01:19:47,104
Was it a nice sunset?

983
01:20:10,594 --> 01:20:12,129
What's this?

984
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:22,306
They're gonna be after us.

985
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:23,307
We have to get out of here.

986
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,474
Come on, let's go, now.

987
01:20:26,911 --> 01:20:28,780
Don't we have anything
to tie her up with?

988
01:20:57,307 --> 01:21:00,577
I do apologize, but this
is the way it has to be.

989
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:02,412
Reed, come on, we can
be better than this.

990
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:03,714
Shut the fuck up, Sarah.

991
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:23,801
Motherfucker.

992
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:24,668
What?

993
01:21:28,372 --> 01:21:30,574
I need to go to the bathroom,

994
01:21:30,607 --> 01:21:32,810
go get the car, I'll
be out in a minute.

995
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:34,277
Yeah, take your
time, why don't you.

996
01:21:34,311 --> 01:21:35,813
Give me a fucking
second, would you?

997
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:08,478
Can you stay with her
until he comes out?

998
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:13,517
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

999
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:25,395
Run, okay?

1000
01:22:25,429 --> 01:22:26,329
Get out of here.

1001
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:28,933
Reed.

1002
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:37,708
[Reed screaming]

1003
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:53,724
[knock on door]

1004
01:22:53,758 --> 01:22:54,759
Reed?

1005
01:23:01,665 --> 01:23:02,499
Hey.

1006
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:06,403
[eerie music]

1007
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:12,409
[knock on door]

1008
01:23:47,377 --> 01:23:49,881
[eerie music]

1009
01:24:30,822 --> 01:24:33,523
[eerie music]

1010
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:37,795
[Sarah] Reed, open the door.

1011
01:24:39,897 --> 01:24:40,730
Open the door.

1012
01:24:42,465 --> 01:24:44,802
Open the fucking door. Reed!

1013
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:49,841
Open the door.

1014
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:56,914
Open the door.

1015
01:24:56,948 --> 01:24:58,415
[banging]

1016
01:24:58,448 --> 01:24:59,984
Reed, open the door.

1017
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:02,619
Open the door right fucking now.

1018
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:04,487
Open the fucking door.

1019
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:10,795
[eerie music]

1020
01:25:27,211 --> 01:25:28,045
[hiss]

1021
01:25:46,496 --> 01:25:47,131
Kyle!

1022
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:48,900
Kyle!

1023
01:25:51,135 --> 01:25:51,969
Kyle!

1024
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,782
[eerie music]

1025
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:12,016
[Kyle screaming]

1026
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:06,703
Sarah!

1027
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:13,610
[glass breaks]

1028
01:28:18,648 --> 01:28:20,217
Sarah.

1029
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:29,126
You should listen
to your brother.

1030
01:28:36,867 --> 01:28:38,601
Come out.

1031
01:28:40,304 --> 01:28:42,306
I just want to talk to you.

1032
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:24,215
I know you're in there, Sarah.

1033
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:33,157
Why did you hurt me?

1034
01:29:35,192 --> 01:29:36,659
Why did you do that?

1035
01:29:38,395 --> 01:29:39,230
I'm bleeding.

1036
01:29:40,798 --> 01:29:42,867
You stabbed me in
the fucking eye.

1037
01:29:45,102 --> 01:29:46,971
Go rot in Hell where you belong.

1038
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,841
I'm sorry, Sarah.

1039
01:29:52,742 --> 01:29:54,845
I never meant to hurt you.

1040
01:29:56,013 --> 01:29:58,182
I was doing you a favor.

1041
01:30:00,284 --> 01:30:05,289
We don't belong
here in this world.

1042
01:30:08,025 --> 01:30:09,827
[Sarah] Maybe you
don't but I do.

1043
01:30:14,098 --> 01:30:14,932
Sarah.

1044
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:18,936
You're never
getting out of here.

1045
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:25,176
We are gonna stay here forever.

1046
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:34,351
Open the fucking
door, you bitch!

1047
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:44,762
How's that eye?

1048
01:31:06,784 --> 01:31:09,353
[eerie music]

1049
01:31:15,192 --> 01:31:16,894
Look what you made me do.

1050
01:31:21,098 --> 01:31:25,269
I know about the clothes
and the bones in the woods.

1051
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:28,072
Oh, the children?

1052
01:31:30,307 --> 01:31:31,442
I was in a cult.

1053
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:35,412
The first ones were my
baby brother and sister.

1054
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,349
I was supposed to be watching
them while my parents

1055
01:31:38,382 --> 01:31:43,387
were out but instead,
I killed and ate them.

1056
01:31:46,824 --> 01:31:49,293
My parents and the town
suspected me of doing it.

1057
01:31:50,828 --> 01:31:53,430
They suspected me of
possessing some kind of evil,

1058
01:31:54,965 --> 01:31:57,268
unimaginable evil.

1059
01:31:58,469 --> 01:32:00,404
It put the fear of
God in all of them.

1060
01:32:02,606 --> 01:32:04,375
But they never
found a trace of me.

1061
01:32:05,876 --> 01:32:06,944
I never went home.

1062
01:32:08,345 --> 01:32:11,815
I've been out here since 1893,

1063
01:32:13,017 --> 01:32:17,187
moving from place
to place, hiding.

1064
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,926
You're a monster.

1065
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,296
What are you going
to do about it?

1066
01:32:25,329 --> 01:32:26,830
No one would believe you,

1067
01:32:26,864 --> 01:32:28,966
even if you had the
chance to tell them.

1068
01:32:30,301 --> 01:32:33,270
Are you really going
to kill a young woman,

1069
01:32:33,304 --> 01:32:37,308
in cold blood, in her own home?

1070
01:32:40,544 --> 01:32:44,982
Yeah, something like that.

1071
01:32:51,422 --> 01:32:54,358
[witch chant]

1072
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:08,238
[Kyle screaming]

1073
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:55,619
Where you're going,
there's only darkness.

1074
01:35:44,094 --> 01:35:47,097
[suspenseful music]

1075
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:12,523
Come out, Sarah.

1076
01:36:13,624 --> 01:36:15,726
Don't be frightened.

1077
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,061
We hardly got a chance
to know each other.

1078
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:21,732
I wanted to tell you more
about the lemon tree.

1079
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:25,602
I know Bee started
to tell you a story.

1080
01:36:34,678 --> 01:36:36,680
Did you drop something, Sarah?

1081
01:36:45,556 --> 01:36:47,624
Bee never got to
apologize to her family

1082
01:36:47,658 --> 01:36:50,093
and for going out to
the lemon tree that day.

1083
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:53,196
She never got to see them again.

1084
01:36:54,665 --> 01:36:56,633
She never got to go home.

1085
01:37:04,508 --> 01:37:07,311
I abducted Bee when she
was only a little girl.

1086
01:37:08,512 --> 01:37:11,148
She was just a little girl.

1087
01:37:12,282 --> 01:37:13,818
She's not my grandmother.

1088
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:17,254
I stole her away
from her family.

1089
01:37:18,622 --> 01:37:19,824
I was going to eat her

1090
01:37:19,857 --> 01:37:23,727
but for some reason
I decided not to.

1091
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:29,700
Instead, I raised her.
More like a pet, really.

1092
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:35,238
But tonight I'm going
to get to eat again,

1093
01:37:36,473 --> 01:37:38,375
now that you're here, Sarah.

1094
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:45,649
I summoned you here.
I brought you here.

1095
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:51,321
You didn't decide
to come here, I did.

1096
01:37:51,355 --> 01:37:52,689
This was no accident.

1097
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:58,629
Every decision in your life
that you thought you made,

1098
01:37:58,662 --> 01:38:01,531
brought you here, with me.

1099
01:38:03,433 --> 01:38:05,669
I'm your only way
out of here, Sarah.

1100
01:38:08,572 --> 01:38:13,577
I'm your angel, come down
from heaven, to save you.

1101
01:38:14,745 --> 01:38:18,548
An angel, just like Grandfather.

1102
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:23,888
Come on out, Sarah.

1103
01:38:24,789 --> 01:38:26,223
We'll have some lemonade.

1104
01:38:37,802 --> 01:38:40,404
[eerie music]

1105
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:55,452
Stay.

1106
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:03,921
[laughing maniacally]

1107
01:40:41,926 --> 01:40:42,894
It's too late.

1108
01:40:45,595 --> 01:40:47,899
[screaming]

1109
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:31,508
[moaning]

1110
01:42:00,503 --> 01:42:03,040
[banging on door]

1111
01:42:37,008 --> 01:42:39,043
[groaning]

1112
01:44:48,072 --> 01:44:51,208
[footsteps approaching]

1113
01:45:33,117 --> 01:45:35,718
[eerie music]

1114
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:37,354
[low growling sound]

1115
01:46:02,379 --> 01:46:03,214
[growling]

1116
01:47:25,496 --> 01:47:28,299
[police radio]

1117
01:48:12,843 --> 01:48:13,911
[TV Reporter] Disturbing
new developments

1118
01:48:13,944 --> 01:48:15,346
in this breaking story.

1119
01:48:15,379 --> 01:48:17,381
Police have found the
suspect's hideout,

1120
01:48:17,414 --> 01:48:20,384
where it is reportedly
a blood bath inside.

1121
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:21,218
The owners of the house,

1122
01:48:21,252 --> 01:48:23,287
an elderly woman
and a young woman,

1123
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:25,489
were found dead inside the home.

1124
01:48:25,522 --> 01:48:28,892
Two of the suspects found
in the house are also dead.

1125
01:48:28,926 --> 01:48:31,395
There is no sign of
the other two suspects,

1126
01:48:31,428 --> 01:48:35,266
one of whom is 27
year-old Sarah Richardson.

1127
01:48:35,299 --> 01:48:37,434
Authorities have been
searching extensively

1128
01:48:37,468 --> 01:48:40,437
for the last 90 minutes
with help from canines.

1129
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:43,007
And she hasn't been
located on the property

1130
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,342
or surrounding half mile radius.

1131
01:48:45,376 --> 01:48:48,112
If you spot her,
please do not approach

1132
01:48:48,145 --> 01:48:50,314
and contact police immediately.

1133
01:48:50,347 --> 01:48:53,250
She is believed to be
armed and dangerous.

1134
01:48:53,284 --> 01:48:55,386
More as the story develops.

1135
01:49:58,682 --> 01:50:00,351
Are you all right?
