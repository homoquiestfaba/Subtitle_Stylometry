00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:05,381
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:08,970
It's Melissa Benoist,
and I'm here on the set of <i>Supergirl,</i>

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:14,308
with some of my amazing
co-stars on the show.

4
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:21,315
[dramatic music playing]

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,861
[dramatic music playing]

6
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,656
We're gonna take a fond look back
at the last six years of the show.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,740
Please join us.

8
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:36,747
[dramatic music playing]

9
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:40,626
[dramatic music playing]

10
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:45,839
I mean, it's changed my life,
this show, um... It's been a joy.

11
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:51,011
And seeing the way that
this canon and mythology affects people,

12
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:54,640
and young girls, and the people
that look up to our characters,

13
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,558
it's, it's very meaningful.

14
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:01,897
I would say that... I wasn't originally
cast as as the Martian Manhunter.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,860
I was actually just cast as 'Hank'
and it was only after the pilot

16
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,112
that I was made the Martian Manhunter.

17
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:13,116
I could remember going home
with a pile of Martian Manhunter comics,

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,286
and just reading all of them
and thinking, 'this guy's awesome'.

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,374
So, I was just really excited
to suddenly get this brand new character

20
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:25,170
and fall into this whole story arc,
which has really been great for me,

21
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:29,091
and I've... I've really, really enjoyed
not just playing the character,

22
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,802
but, meeting all these fabulous people,

23
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,263
and also, learning to...
directing on this show as well.

24
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:37,766
- So, it's really been, to me, sort of...
- [male voice] Money!

25
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,561
- It's been money. It's been...
- [all scream] Money!

26
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,897
Well, on the piggyback off of that,
you know,

27
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:48,151
for me, it's like I wore one plaid shirt
in season one, and season two, I'm gay.

28
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,504
- You know what I mean? It was like...
- [all laughing]

29
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:50,713
- I had no idea.
- [all laughing]

30
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,197
And then... gay!

31
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,408
- [all laughing]
- It was three plaid shirts.

32
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:57,577
- It was three...
- He was counting them.

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,247
- It was that third.
- It's a three step process.

34
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,475
[Brooks] Were they all
the same plaid or different plaids?

35
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,793
Different plaid. Different plaid. Yes.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,254
No, it's been, it's been

37
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,049
the greatest experience
of my life, my career.

38
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:13,593
I learned so much about myself

39
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,762
and about working with

40
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:18,348
such incredible people
that are inspiring

41
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:20,600
and, you know, kick your ass every day

42
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:24,313
to just be better
and just to keep growing.

43
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:28,108
And, it's been pretty fantastic,
also being able to direct,

44
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,277
- [Harewood] Mm-hmm.
- Like just something

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,612
that we've kind of all
been doing since Season one.

46
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:36,658
But, to really put it on its feet
has been an honor and a pleasure.

47
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,453
[Rath] Yeah,
getting to direct on the show

48
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:40,996
- has been a...
- [all laughing]

49
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:43,361
- ...real achievement for me.
- Next season, next season.

50
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,832
- [Brooks] He's directing 701, right?
- [all laugh]

51
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:50,589
Well, you see, he was set to, however.

52
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:53,342
- I'm directing the bonus features.
- [all laughing]

53
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,552
- That's in the blooper reel.
- [all laughing]

54
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:59,389
I mean, this character for me has,
has just been monumental,

55
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:04,728
and, I mean, I've only been in
the business industry for two weeks.

56
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:06,905
That's why you
call it the business industry.

57
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,860
Yeah, listen. I'm young,
I'm new, I don't know better.

58
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:14,488
But, I mean,
it's, it's just been the most

59
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,758
incredible experience
and getting to work with all of you guys

60
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,700
and getting to learn from you
and watch you

61
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,953
and be a part of your directorial
debuts, except for Melissa,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,540
um, but I've learned great things.

63
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,920
Um, and getting to bring
this character to life

64
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,173
and then getting to bring her
into the comics as well,

65
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:37,386
and just be a part of her journey, and,

66
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:41,014
build her into something
bigger than she originally was

67
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:45,310
has been just a complete,
incredible honor,

68
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:48,081
- and, I love her very much.
- [Katie] Aww, little dreamer over there.

69
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:50,185
- [Nichole] Little dreamer.
- [Katie] Little dreamer.

70
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,987
My favorite scene is the scene where

71
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:59,616
Staz and Melissa do karaoke
and sing <i>Africa.</i>

72
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,036
<i>- I think it's, it's magical,</i>
- [female voice] <i>That was fun.</i>

73
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:05,872
and I... I watched it on repeat,

74
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,666
I love it so much.

75
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,461
I preface this, we, that was,
that was a lot of fun,

76
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,565
but it was also kind of, we had kind of,
haphazardly kind of figured that out,

77
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:17,342
because I think both of us assumed
we weren't doing the whole song.

78
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,736
And then we ended up
doing the whole song...

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,029
- We did the whole song.
- We did the whole song.

80
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,334
So, I was like, okay, just,
if you don't know the words...

81
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,307
- We said, "Let us sing <i>Africa,</i> Toto."
- No.

82
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,827
- We knew the chorus.
- [male voice] It was wonderful.

83
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,245
- Right, so then,
- [everyone speaking]

84
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,269
I was just like, "Just mime out
what you remember."

85
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,354
You sounded beautiful.

86
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,691
- It was a lot of fun.
- It sounded beautiful.

87
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:35,485
And, you know, both of us come from
like, a musical background.

88
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,655
So it's really nice that, at any point,
get to kind of find a way

89
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:42,784
to kind of ah, combine
all the mediums of art.

90
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,637
So, it was really fun.
I really liked it. It was fun.

91
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,764
- It was always fun when we did karaoke.
- [Nair] It was really fun.

92
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,124
- Yeah.
- Especially Carl Lumbly.

93
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:50,499
Yeah.

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,769
- Singing Elvis.
- No, I was going to say that

95
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,712
that's definitely one of the standouts.

96
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,590
And I was kind of opposed
to doing a karaoke episode

97
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:58,800
because it was like "my episode",

98
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:00,927
and I read the first page
and I'm like,

99
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,491
"Of course, it's freaking karaoke.
They're gonna make me sing."

100
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,518
And, um, and then it turned out to be
one of my, one of the most fun bits

101
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:12,147
because everybody, well,
most people, had a number,

102
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,941
I mean, Mehcad sang like his own song,
which was super badass.

103
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:15,984
Yeah.

104
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:18,045
Chris over there who's actually
a really good singer,

105
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,822
- was belting out...
- [all laughing]

106
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,240
I was trying really hard.

107
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,826
Your voice cracked and that was...

108
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,870
Oh, yeah, that was fun.
That was a good one.

109
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,931
[Jordan] And then everybody else
is doing like their little bits.

110
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,142
It was, it was really fun
to watch people out of their...

111
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,835
- Carl Lumbly one day.
- Chyler's over there, crying.

112
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,046
- It's also like...
- [everyone speaking]

113
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:38,316
It's also just nice to flip the genre
on its head a little bit.

114
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,259
You know, we're playing superheroes
and all these stakes.

115
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:43,112
And all of a sudden,
we get to kind of explore

116
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,513
the musical aspect of creativity.

117
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,974
My favorite scene that we ever did
is in my favorite episode.

118
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,936
and it was Slavers' Moon,
which is in Season two,

119
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,080
- I can't remember which episode it was.
- [male voice] Ah, yes.

120
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,064
Nine.

121
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:57,609
In the quarry, things were-
it was pouring rain.

122
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,812
Let's hope this thing works,

123
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:00,737
[beeping]

124
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:08,119
It was Kevin Smith's first episode
and he ordered, like, a...

125
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:09,597
- the bacon truck.
- ...bacon truck.

126
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,766
- All of us were just eating...
- [male voice] Bacon wrapped bacon.

127
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,709
- Bacon wrapped bacon bread with, like...
- [male voice] Wow.

128
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,437
- ...cheese and...
- [female voice] Bacon grease.

129
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,461
- goodness.
- [male voice] It was pouring rain.

130
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:18,648
- Pouring rain...
- I was not there that day.

131
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:21,132
We're playing game
in a random school bus...

132
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:22,300
- Yes
- And...

133
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,111
- Sounds like Burning Man.
- Sounds sort of Star Warsy.

134
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,472
It was so Star Warsy, and
it was like a buddy adventure.

135
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:30,392
- Planet 51 ARC B.
- That's Maaldoria.

136
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,228
People that were there, the aliens.
What were they called?

137
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:36,648
Slaving is a big business on Maaldoria.

138
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:38,650
[imitating the alien] Maaldoria.

139
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,862
- It was!
- [male voice] Of course, you remember.

140
00:06:46,366 --> 00:06:50,537
In Season two,
I had to eat ten pancakes at once.

141
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Thank you.

142
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,124
Hey, do you want syr...?

143
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,543
[all laughing]

144
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,020
- That was probably...
- That was your stunt?

145
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:00,213
- [everyone speaking]
- Stunt?

146
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,048
That is a stunt!

147
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,717
- Stunt eating?
- Stunt eating, yes.

148
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Ten at one time?

149
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,095
Yeah, it was, It was
a big stack of pancakes,

150
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,178
and I was like, "Oh,
this is going to be so funny."

151
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:10,348
And then my jaw went like...

152
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,725
[choking sounds]

153
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,810
That, and also when you ate the pizza.

154
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,271
- Oh yeah, I did that...
- You need to start eating

155
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,648
- like a normal person.
- Apparently, yeah.

156
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,043
- Apparently it was...
- What happened with the pizza?

157
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,736
It was a big stack of pizzas.

158
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,939
- Oh, the big stack of pizzas?
- And he kept saying...

159
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,883
Okay, Chris, you got to stop eating
the pizza because we don't have enough.

160
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:30,094
Oh, yeah, they didn't make enough
pizzas. They made like, two pizzas,

161
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:32,579
and I was like eating three per take.

162
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,497
Yeah, I had a pizza scene this season,

163
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,541
and I was like,
"Maybe I'll eat the whole pizza."

164
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,465
And someone was like,
"Chris already did that."

165
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,093
- That's so Season four.
- [female voice] Yeah.

166
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,633
We do have a fantastic stunt team.

167
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,069
- [female voice] <i>Yeah, we do.</i>
- [male voice] <i>They're so amazing!</i>

168
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,721
<i>Give it up for Simon Burnett.</i>

169
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,074
- Just the whole team of just being...
- [Nair] Absolutely.

170
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,618
- ...really, really fantastic.
- [female voice] Yeah.

171
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:56,686
I got to spend about eight hours
in a water tank.

172
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,122
- Which was...
- Yeah, that looked fun.

173
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,749
- ...something else.
- How pruney were you?

174
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,775
I was so pruney.

175
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,295
[Nair] I remember doing a stunt
this season, actually.

176
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
And, um, me being over eager, as always.

177
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:10,158
And, uh, letting my ADHD run riot,

178
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,262
I spoke to Jesse and the directors and
I'm like, "Please let me do my stunt."

179
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,038
Let me, let me be a part of this.

180
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,207
You know, mind you our
stunt people are amazing.

181
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,752
Um, and, sure enough, they let me.
And I have to save this child,

182
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,212
and I go grab the child.

183
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,713
- Yeah.
- Our child?

184
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,524
- [indistinct]
- No, not your child. It was actually

185
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,968
Simon Burnett, our stunt coordinator
and director on one of these episodes.

186
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:31,513
He... we got his son hired to do
the stunt with me.

187
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,264
I have to grab him and shield him,

188
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,434
protect him from the,
from the shattering glass.

189
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:38,603
You know, hero William. All going great

190
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:40,581
and I'm like, you know, I'm like "No!"
and I'm running,

191
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,005
and I charge at him and I grab him.

192
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:45,151
And when I go to grab him,
I being overzealous as always,

193
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:48,113
roly poly legs over, just,

194
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,740
- just like that.
- Did you harm the child?

195
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,826
- No, child's obviously fine.
- Simons son.

196
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,327
- He's fine.
- He's obviously fine.

197
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,806
- He rolled out of it like, like that.
- I rolled out of it like a genie.

198
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,581
But I looked ridiculous.

199
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:01,626
And of course, there was press
or fans or paparazzi

200
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,586
filming this moment.

201
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,088
So, if, and the next morning,

202
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,841
I'm like, "I wonder if anyone
spotted my little mishap."

203
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,134
And sure enough,

204
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:12,762
you're just, the only take
that someone put online is just me.

205
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,517
And then Chyler, being the consummate
professional, still runs up.

206
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,603
She runs up and does her move
still like, "I'm a superhero!"

207
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,897
Meanwhile, I'm like... Oh, it was great!

208
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,065
I hate that I missed that.

209
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,818
Yeah, I'll send you it,
I'll send you it. It's on Instagram.

210
00:09:27,694 --> 00:09:29,821
[Benoist] The craziest day
I've had stunt wise,

211
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:33,908
was on the green screen and the wires,
and me in the harness, hanging.

212
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:36,453
And I was with Tyler Hoechlin,
playing Superman,

213
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:38,121
and he was like, "I'm good, I'm good."

214
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,707
And I called it,
and I was like, "I'm done."

215
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,626
- And I walked off set like this.
- [all laughing]

216
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,296
I couldn't walk.

217
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,023
- Hard work, ladies and gentlemen.
- [female voice] It's hard.

218
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:51,885
It is fun when
you're being carried by Supergirl.

219
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,053
- That was...
- I was carried almost all of you.

220
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:55,846
- It's lovely.
- [Brooks] Twice.

221
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,167
- It's quite comfortable.
- Twice.

222
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,684
It's hilarious. I'm like, "come on."

223
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:03,271
- I carried you and Jeremy both...
- [Brooks] Yes.

224
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:04,939
- ...at one time. Yeah.
- [Brooks] Yes.

225
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,860
[Brooks] There was nothing,
nothing more emasculating than that.

226
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:09,943
It was great, though.

227
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:11,672
- It was hilarious, yeah.
- I wish you could,

228
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:14,656
I wish you could have carried me when
I could have, like, looked up at you.

229
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,659
But I was like, a zombie or something.

230
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,637
- Just in a little blankets, like...
- I think I was awake.

231
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,848
That was the one where you guys were,
like, mind controlled, right?

232
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,600
- Was it that one?
- That was me, that was me.

233
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:23,833
That was, you did it too.

234
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,519
- We both did it?
- No, yeah, we both did it.

235
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,354
- I was mind controlled.
- We both were mind controlled?

236
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,588
I was also mind controlled.

237
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,232
- I was mind controlled.
- Yes, you were.

238
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,942
- Did you fall off the roof?
- Raise your hand

239
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,069
- if you've been mind controlled.
- No, we jumped, we jumped off...

240
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,887
We jumped off his...

241
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,928
On the sets?

242
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,032
We jumped out a window
as mind controlled.

243
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:40,225
Hold on, yeah.
Who's been mind controlled?

244
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,477
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, on the show.

245
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,229
- Right.
- [all laughing]

246
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:49,317
One of the funniest things that we did

247
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,903
aside from just being insane
all the time,

248
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:53,826
- [female voice] Mm-hmm.
- especially this one.

249
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:58,326
Melissa, just like dancing
and frolicking all the time,

250
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,662
- Yeah.
- ...was, cloth magic.

251
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:03,581
- Cloth magic.
- Has that made it into the world yet?

252
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:06,084
- No, we gotta bring it...
- Yeah, I think I posted it.

253
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,978
Can I get context?
I don't even know what cloth magic is.

254
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,840
[Wood] Cloth Magic <i>is a spin off show
that never quite happened, uh...</i>

255
00:11:11,923 --> 00:11:14,008
[Benoist] It was like cape tricks
that we did,

256
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:16,445
where he would, like, whip the cape
around someone, you know.

257
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,389
As a weapon,
he would use his cape as a weapon

258
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,890
and is a grappling hook sometimes.

259
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:24,102
We made a magic...
an instructional magic video

260
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,974
- [Wood] Based on the dialog.
- Based on Cloth Magic.

261
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,457
And basically we would just put it,

262
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:32,235
put either of their capes up,
and then pull 'em down and something

263
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:33,820
would happen behind them,

264
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,196
and that there was one...

265
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,574
Jeremy would turn into Chyler or...

266
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,552
[Jordan] Yeah,
we would turn into each other,

267
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,078
like our legion rings
would switch fingers,

268
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:46,624
or like, there was one,
there was one in the DEO,

269
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,003
where, where Melissa and Chris came and

270
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,213
they put their capes up
and then they pulled it down,

271
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,173
and David's just like this on the table.

272
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:56,676
There was some good ones.

273
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,241
What I think is the funniest moments

274
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,847
are any time David
forgets his line on set.

275
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,090
[female voice] It's the best!

276
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,143
- Yes.
- It's, it's the confidence in which...

277
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:12,525
It's the confidence in which
he hits his mark... and line.

278
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,319
[all laughing]

279
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,822
Or, or when he's directing,
which is understandable.

280
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:21,159
He's directing an episode,
and he's also in the scene

281
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,453
but forgets that he has
the first line of the scene.

282
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,080
So, if you know David,
the way he directs is

283
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:28,601
there's this lot of energy,
so he'll be like, "All right, that's it,

284
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,501
keep that energy,
keep that energy, all right,

285
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:31,961
and... action!"

286
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:33,462
Line.

287
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:42,221
But the single most reliable shot
you can get, in the entirety

288
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,057
- of <i>Supergirl...</i>
- The money.

289
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:45,642
- ...is the money!
- The money.

290
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,447
- Right there.
- Right there, on the couch.

291
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,403
[Nair] You must have
internal dialogue, David.

292
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,358
I mean, every day is really funny. I...

293
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,859
I'm like, with you.

294
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:57,570
I didn't really work,
I haven't really worked with uh...

295
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,590
- everyone, all at once and...
- I'm Chris.

296
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,366
I know, that's what I'm saying...

297
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,660
- We actually, literally just met now.
- We just met.

298
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,914
Um, but I'm always on with
Jon Cryer and Matt Baram

299
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:12,251
who are both hysterical
and probably, actually the fun-

300
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,753
the funniest moment I had.

301
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:16,881
I mean, I hope that one of these
makes it, makes it in.

302
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:19,050
But like, there's this
super intense scene

303
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:23,137
where Nyxly meet Lex Luthor
for the first time and she's given him

304
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,432
what for because he's like,
"You're just like my dad."

305
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,601
- And, uh...
- Been there.

306
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,646
and, you know,
I'm like, tearing up and all the things.

307
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,148
And Matt Barnes, who plays Mitch
on the show, who is

308
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:35,713
- hilarious.
- [male voice] So funny.

309
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:36,985
He's so funny.

310
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,861
Hold onto your jeggings sister.

311
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:40,989
You've got company.

312
00:13:41,197 --> 00:13:45,576
He had this one line when he
makes an entrance and it's just like,

313
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,246
basically, "... oh, sorry,

314
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,914
what's Lex Luthor doing here?"

315
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,458
But every single take he would be like,

316
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,086
"I just tried a milkshake
for the first time."

317
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:58,006
"Oh, sorry, what's that?
Sorry, I got a parking ticket on..."

318
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,175
It was just like, and I would like
be, like, looking at Lex

319
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,552
with like, my eyes watering,

320
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,355
and then I would turn around
and just break.

321
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,180
Every time.
Every time, it was just like...

322
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,559
Oh, the best thing was in,
was in your episode, right?

323
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:13,563
We were, we had just gotten
out of the shield or whatever.

324
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,024
And I go up and I have my dream glass

325
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,069
ready to shoot him.
I walk up to him and he goes,

326
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:20,445
"[gasps] I had
a dream glass last night."

327
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,404
- It was...
- Dream glass.

328
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,741
One last funny thing.

329
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:27,201
I auditioned to play James Olsen.

330
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:28,870
I auditioned for James Olsen.

331
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,247
- Did you really?
- When I was 24-25.

332
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,460
Funny thing is,
I auditioned for Supergirl, so...

333
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:38,313
- I thought I could do anything.
- This is so funny.

334
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,857
- I thought I could do anything.
- Triggered, triggered.

335
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:40,923
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,301
I feel like we just
missed a jam from Katie

337
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,611
that she auditioned to play Alex.

338
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,680
I had completely forgotten
that I put a tape down for Alex.

339
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:48,991
- No way!
- ...till you said that.

340
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,434
- Oh, God! Everybody hold on...
- [laughter]

341
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:59,192
There was a little girl who is actually
a daughter of one of our crew members.

342
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,878
- [male voice] Oh, yeah.
- When she met me, she went,

343
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:01,818
[imitating girl] "I have a question.

344
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,073
Is your belt attached
to your skirt or your shirt?"

345
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,077
No, it's Liston's daughter.

346
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,620
She just can't say her R's yet.

347
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:12,371
Which one was it attached to?

348
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,124
- It's not attached...
- [all laughing]

349
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,102
- What's the answer?
- But actually now, I really wanna know

350
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:19,646
- the answer to that question.
- It wasn't attached to anything.

351
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:21,464
Cloth magic.

352
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,842
It was a floating belt.

353
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:25,968
Well...

354
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,720
How did it stay on?

355
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,472
- What?
- How did it stay on? Velcro?

356
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,933
That's, I wore so many belts
on this show

357
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:35,478
that we're like top sticked to pants
that had no belt loops

358
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,772
- So just taped to the waist?
- Yes.

359
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,023
They love a taped belt.

360
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:41,484
- Movie magic guys. Taped to the waist.
- Cloth magic.

361
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,444
[Leigh] We had a great moment, um...

362
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:50,201
We did a Comic Con in Chicago
and really had the-

363
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,704
the line for people to come through
and get autographs and whatnot.

364
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:54,872
And there was a family.

365
00:15:54,956 --> 00:16:00,044
This woman came through
with her two daughters and, one was...

366
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,128
- Oh, yeah.
- ...you know, her biological daughter,

367
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,173
and then another, the other was adopted.

368
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:09,011
And it was such a wonderful moment
because they looked at the both of us

369
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:12,431
just saying, "You embody exactly like
what we have in our house,

370
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:13,975
and we don't never get to see that."

371
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,102
And to see, like, a healthy

372
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,938
family dynamic like that
especially, you know.

373
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,357
And the young girl said,
"Like me being adopted,

374
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,111
coming to the family feeling
like, I was, like I belonged."

375
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,532
It meant so much. That was, that
I remember was really, really special.

376
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,053
One thing I remember in terms
of fan interaction, a friend of mine,

377
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:36,998
when I was kind of growing up, I didn't
have much of a good sort of background.

378
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,792
So good, good friends would bring me in,

379
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,878
take me in, kind of
put a roof over my head.

380
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:45,047
And one of, one of my friend's fathers
actually ended up watching Supergirl

381
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:49,051
because he, uh, would read the comics
and I didn't get to,

382
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:50,821
didn't get to see him
as he was dying of cancer

383
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,364
because I was working,
didn't have enough money.

384
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:53,988
But he would be watching me on the show,

385
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,350
and when he passed, I called the family,

386
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,036
And I said, you know,
"I'm sorry I couldn't be there."

387
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,372
And they're like, "You know what,
he felt like he got to see you

388
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:01,874
- because he watched the show."
- Aww.

389
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,751
And I didn't even know, right. I didn't
actually find out until he passed.

390
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,128
And with this show,
and I thought the same thing.

391
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:09,363
I never, I never assumed that people
of our age wrote a kind of... thank you

392
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:12,867
...watch this show. So to kind of, to
be able to represent what I love doing

393
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,536
and be able to kind of, connect
that to my personal life.

394
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,122
That was kind of, a wonderful
kind of fan interact...

395
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,041
to find out someone who I loved,
was a fan.

396
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:25,046
I get a lot of letters from girls and
I know this sounds, saying that they,

397
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:28,216
until they saw Lena Luthor on TV,
they didn't think, was it

398
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,676
okay for girls to be studying science.

399
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:32,568
And there's a lot of girls
who were like,

400
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,640
"And I'm now in my fourth year
in engineering,

401
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,576
"and I have you to thank for that,
and the show to thank for that."

402
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,602
And it's such a small thing,
it seems like.

403
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,146
But that's the beginning
of a whole new life for them that

404
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,982
they didn't think was possible,
because of watching the show.

405
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,919
- You know, I'll always...
- Being able to see

406
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:49,695
- see yourself and see options for...
- Yeah.

407
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,924
- ...yourself is really, really powerful.
- Absolutely.

408
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:54,659
This is formative for a
lot of people out there,

409
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,619
in different, so many different ways,

410
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,889
depending on who they connect
with the most in the show.

411
00:17:58,913 --> 00:17:59,871
And I think that's what's so great.

412
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,392
There are so many different
characters on the show.

413
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,418
There's so many different people
that they can connect with, you know.

414
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:07,421
And there's so much opportunity for them
to see themselves...

415
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,923
- Totally.
- ...on a show.

416
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:14,011
I mean, I feel like we have to talk
about when you meet small children

417
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:18,557
who think that you're really a superhero
and think that all of your powers

418
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:20,518
and everything you do is real

419
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:22,663
and then getting
to navigate the conversation there,

420
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:25,731
like, I just talked to a little girl
on set a little while ago

421
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:28,985
- and she was like, "Make a shield!"
- [all laughing]

422
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,945
"Do it!" And I was like, "I can't."

423
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,571
And she's like, "Why?"

424
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:34,198
"I'm tired...

425
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,659
Because I'm Dreamer."

426
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,704
It gets sticky for me
because then they'll watch me jump

427
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,787
and then just...

428
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:43,916
go back to the ground.
Like, I have to jump.

429
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,876
They're so disappointed.

430
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,422
Guys, I get that there's still days
where I see Melissa in the suit,

431
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:51,185
- and I'm like, "That's Supergirl."
- Yeah!

432
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:55,136
Like it still happens, or I see any of
you guys all dressed up as superheroes

433
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,180
and, you know, I still get a moment
where I'm like, "This is..."

434
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,808
- Yeah.
- Yeah, because it's like iconic.

435
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,393
We have a, Chyler and I...

436
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,228
the young girl Mila, who's five,

437
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,313
who plays our daughter...

438
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,606
- She's so cute.
- She's so cute.

439
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,277
This house needed a guardian angel
and now we have you.

440
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:15,489
We had a scene in the dive bar
and we were supposed to clear

441
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:17,616
and then Mel had a whole stunt thing,

442
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,244
and I look over and Mila's doing
all of the power moves

443
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:22,180
- that Mel's doing at the same time.
- That's so cute.

444
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,832
And I just saw her shoulders go back
and her get more confident.

445
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,419
And it was like the first time
seeing a little girl, in real time,

446
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,005
physically change, watching Supergirl.

447
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,674
- And then that same little girl,
- Are you going to say it?

448
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,176
Says [laughs]

449
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,844
- I was like...
- We have this...

450
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,263
We have this stunt stuff
and we're laying on gravel

451
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:40,782
and we've just saved her and she says...

452
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,659
- Wasn't it first, before she said this?
- Say it.

453
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,062
So she goes, "I'm a good person.
How did I end up on these rocks?"

454
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,372
Because we're like doing these stunts

455
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,690
- and then she keeps moaning.
- [indistinct]

456
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,752
I come down and we've been
up and down on the rocks,

457
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,211
and I just lay down.
She looks over at me and she's like,

458
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,796
- "You're too old for this."
- "You're too old for this."

459
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,155
[all laughing]

460
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,158
- I was like, "You're right."
- Supergirl versus us,

461
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,618
is a different experience.

462
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,204
[Wood] And you said,
"No, I am a finely aged cheese."

463
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,002
We do really long days, sometimes,

464
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,730
and you get kind of punchy
at the end of the day.

465
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:15,716
And my favorite times, always on set,
is when David starts to corpse.

466
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,804
And then this just infectious,
and this corpse, he starts laughing.

467
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,240
- You say that over here?
- Growing up, I think.

468
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,392
- Corpse means like, dead.
- No, no, we say,

469
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,727
that's what we say.
Corpse laughing, laughing, right?

470
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:28,187
- Yeah.
- LuthorCorpse.

471
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,772
Do you get the giggle?

472
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,417
But he gets it, and then you're just
gone, and then everybody's gone

473
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,586
for a good five or ten minutes
and you can't bring it back.

474
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,945
Yeah, that's what I'll miss.

475
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:37,905
I'll miss the laughter.

476
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,407
I'll miss dancing with you,

477
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:41,009
dancing with everyone,
I danced with everyone.

478
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,387
- You've never danced with me.
- Yeah, yeah, I'll miss the people.

479
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,080
You know, um, you guys
got a few more years than I did,

480
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,416
- and... it's...
- You're calling us aged cheese?

481
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,877
Yes, absolutely. No, I think it's...

482
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,423
It's nice to work with a bunch of people
who really care about the work

483
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,675
and you care about the craft, and...

484
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,637
genuinely don't let their success
go to their heads.

485
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,515
And it's just nice to work
with a bunch of people who really care.

486
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,785
And who are nice.
And, yeah, I'm going to miss the people.

487
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,687
- I just carry my [indistinct]
- I'll also, endlessly...

488
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,815
miss being impressed by Melissa
looking at a two page scene

489
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:16,277
in a monologue just knowing it.
She's just like, "Yeah, I got it."

490
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,197
And you're like... It's, it's
that's a superpower.

491
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,783
That is a real superpower.

492
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:25,453
Rain Mel, Rain Mel,
it's Rain Mel, you know.

493
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:26,996
Julie, what are you gonna miss?

494
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:29,331
- [male voice] Yeah?
- Well... well,

495
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:31,083
- You hate me now.
- [indistinct]

496
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,087
Oh, yeah, this steamy, steamy set, um...

497
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:38,924
I think I'm with Staz,
I got to work with...

498
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,553
very special people, and I think
I'll miss you guys the most.

499
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,681
I think, like you said,
the collaboration is really great and...

500
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:49,477
and it's, yeah, I think the
friendships is what you miss.

501
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:53,022
Even if it's hard sometimes here,
like there's gonna be moments,

502
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,465
like two months from now,
three months from now, and you go,

503
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:57,531
- "That's not going to happen again."
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,029
And I can just,
I can tell you straight up, like

505
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,365
having been gone a year,
you miss each other.

506
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:04,992
- Yeah.
- You miss each other.

507
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,053
The one thing about being-
having such transient job,

508
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,264
where you're all kind of, we're all
kind of glorified gypsies, right?

509
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,916
We're always moving on and making
these wonderful connections,

510
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,144
and having these wonderful experiences,
whether they're professional

511
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,505
or personal, and then all of a sudden
they shatter into a thousand pieces

512
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:21,217
and you know, you get to kind of,
get fragments of it from there on.

513
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,319
You know, I hope we get to,

514
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,223
I really do. I hope we all
get to work together,

515
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,973
whenever, other than you,
in any capacity, and yeah.

516
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,993
Love you guys so much, I'm gonna
miss this, it's been a pleasure.

517
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,853
And we've also had,
you know, fabulous crew.

518
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:34,104
- Oh, my God, yes!
- Yes!

519
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:37,983
It has been lovely
to work with a family,

520
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:42,029
a real family type, group of people
that kind of support each other.

521
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,990
- That's been, I'll definitely miss that.
- [female voice] Mm-hmm, yeah.

522
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:48,744
And you know what, I do think
I'll miss playing a superhero.

523
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:49,745
Yeah?

524
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:51,622
When enough time has gone by

525
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,582
and I'm, you know, I have some energy.

526
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:56,873
Who's been mind controlled?

527
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,736
I got my tinfoil hat.
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,172
Hello, everyone.

529
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,776
What camera are you people looking at?

530
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,694
I'm like, cross eyed,
trying to look at all of them.

531
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:05,718
Hello, everyone.

532
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:09,765
When I was growing up,
and I, you know, I, I, I...

533
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,018
God, I... So, um, I, yeah, wow,
give me one second.

534
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:14,979
On second take, line, line, line?

535
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:16,984
Why are you smiling
on both sides of your teeth?

536
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:19,733
Wow!

537
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:21,902
My chair keeps breaking. [grunting]

538
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,699
I've literally been in this set,
the entire season.

539
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,075
I have never left CatCo.

540
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,743
We had a whole scene.

541
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:30,995
Where were we?

542
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,372
- Not here.
- Oh, right!

543
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,248
- It was last week!
- Yeah, it was last week!

544
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:36,499
Wow!

545
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,086
I'm gonna miss, uh, the green skin.

546
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,129
I was going to ask you if you were.

547
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,506
I mean, you're still wearing it.

548
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,673
I'm never taking it off.

549
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,467
And he wasn't even on set today!

550
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:48,153
You're like Keanu Reeves with the bus,
so you just fell under it.

551
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,180
I will take it with me, to my grave.

552
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,516
To my cheesy grave.

553
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:55,019
- To my Gorgonzola grave.
- Funniest thing.

554
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,854
Gorgonzola grave.

555
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,483
[all] Thank you, Super Fans!

556
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,695
[all cheering]

557
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,281
[all applauding]

558
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:11,493
[upbeat music playing]
