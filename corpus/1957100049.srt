Man on radio:
He's taking a dump, boss.

182
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,561
And?

183
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,217
Man:
So what do you want me to do?

184
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,003
Nothing.

185
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,309
I'm gonna kill you.

186
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,536
You, let's go.
Come on.

187
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:31,164
Stay here.

188
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,083
Hey.
Yo, Henry, where you at?

189
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,127
Fuck!

190
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,218
What the fuck?

191
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,090
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry about it.

192
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:47,180
El Viejo's gonna flip out.

193
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:48,964
Fuck him.

194
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,707
What the fuck happened?

195
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,970
He decided he would kill
those two motherfuckers
back there.

196
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,060
Why the fuck
you do that?

197
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,496
[speaks French]

198
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,107
You might as well have left us
where you found us.

199
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,673
You're welcome.

200
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,284
Are you at least gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on?

201
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,503
I'm retired.
I don't kill people anymore.

202
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:07,896
So... so what now?

203
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,159
So now we find the target
and we get her to safety.

204
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,032
Wait, what?

205
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:16,209
I don't think you know
who El Viejo is.

206
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,821
I mean, he will literally
chase us down to the ends
of the earth.

207
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,215
Stop talking, slick.

208
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,608
So instead of finishing
that bitch off,

209
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,045
we're gonna rescue her?

210
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,351
Fuck that.

211
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,090
One full magazine.

212
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,395
That's it.

213
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,614
Don't waste it.

214
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,445
-You stay here.
-I'm coming with.

215
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,011
No, you're staying here.

216
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,144
What for?
There's nothing to do here.

217
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,059
There's plenty to do here,
and it will be safe.

218
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,714
I don't wanna be safe.

219
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,150
Are you suicidal?

220
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,673
Yeah.

221
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,545
Fine, but do it here.
Let's go.

222
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,158
Okay, you guys go.

223
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,464
I'll cover your asses.

224
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:38,682
Alone.

225
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,872
They're here boss,
alone.

226
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,052
Kill 'em all.

227
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,141
Get the target.

228
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,145
You hear me?
Kill 'em all!

229
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,189
Get the target.

230
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,592
Bye-bye, bitch.

231
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,941
[gunshot]

232
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,150
Man, this place
is fucking huge.

233
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,987
She could be anywhere.

234
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,249
If she's even here.

235
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,904
Why don't we just
call out to her?

236
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,558
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

237
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:12,820
You think we're alone?

238
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:29,010
You go left.
You go right.

239
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,925
I'll be upstairs.

240
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,014
We'll meet back here.

241
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,364
Get it done.

242
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,318
Hey.

243
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:18,625
We got company.

244
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,409
Any word?

245
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,285
No one's answering,

246
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,025
but I'll keep trying.

247
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,507
Okay.

248
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,270
-[door opens]
-Woman: It was fantastic.

249
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,968
Oh, honey, of course
we missed you.

250
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,318
It's never the same
without you.

251
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,020
Of course I do.

252
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:07,674
How could I stay mad at you?

253
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,329
Charlotte told me
to tell you, "Hi."

254
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,467
Are you... asking me out
on a date, sir?

255
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,384
I can't think
of anything better.

256
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,520
Love you too.

257
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,913
Jerk.

258
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,221
[sighs]

259
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:47,453
Crazy.

260
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:54,721
This diamond ring
could feed an entire village
in Africa for a year.

261
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,943
It's so beautiful.

262
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,249
Thank you.

263
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,121
And it's from there.

264
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,689
Yeah.

265
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,478
You like what you do?

266
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:20,094
My father was
in the military.

267
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,619
Brother, uncle...

268
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,320
It's all I've ever known.

269
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,064
So you always wanted
to be a soldier?

270
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:38,591
No.

271
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:41,028
I want to be a...

272
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,551
-princess.
-[laughs]

273
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,295
Chinese princess.

274
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,515
No.

275
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,168
Just a princess.

276
00:23:56,957 --> 00:23:59,786
Well, I have everything
I've ever wanted:

277
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,788
Money, jewelry,

278
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,616
cars.
[chuckles]

279
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:06,532
I am living my dream.

280
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,455
But it's not enough.

281
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,681
No.

282
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,864
Why?

283
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,263
I don't know.

284
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:14,991
'Sup, girl?

285
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,516
You know where I can find
a pool around here?

286
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,474
No.

287
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,128
They said it was
in this area.

288
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:22,521
I was hoping maybe you
could help me find it.

289
00:26:02,822 --> 00:26:04,519
Do you know who the fuck I am?

290
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,568
[gunshots ricochet]

291
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,527
[gun clicks]

292
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,488
[gun clicks]

293
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,498
Shit.

294

[yawning]

295
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,938
Don't mind me.
I had a long night.

296
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:34,593
So what's up?
You just chilling?

297
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:36,812
Yeah, nothing.

298
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,509
My name's Clayton
by the way.

299
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:43,602
-Ruby.
-Ruby? I like that.

300
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,517
And you are gorgeous.

301
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,259
[grunting]

302
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,201
Typical dumb broad.

303
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,464
See, you give a girl
a couple compliments,

304
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,379
and she melts
right in your damn hands.

305
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,642
The key to my ass...

306
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,034

[screaming]

308
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,693
Little Missy got
some moves, huh?

309
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,608
-Show me what you got.
-You ready for this?

310
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,654
You done fucked with
the wrong person today.
Come on!

311
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,789
The hell's wrong
with you, huh?

312
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,930
[screams]

313
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,745

316
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:20,149
-Give me the gun.
-No, he's done.

317
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:22,717
I had him.
What are you doing?
I had him.

318
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,068
You don't see me
up in your business, do you?

319
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,809
What are you even
doing out here?

320
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:29,811
Go fucking help your son
and Mack.

321
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,770
From now on,
there's a chain of command.

322
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,510
You don't talk
to me directly.

323
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:35,861
You need something,
you talk to Junior,
Junior talks to me.

324
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,647
What makes you think
you can make these rules up?

325
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,344
You're not the boss of me.

326
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,781
I'm my own boss.

327
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:46,436
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are, old man,

328
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,830
but this ain't
the '50s anymore.
You're not needed.

329
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,484
[speaks French]

330
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,486
[shrieks]

331
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,838
What?

332
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:58,144
You can't touch a girl?

333
00:29:58,187 --> 00:30:00,363
You murder people
for a living, deary.

334
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,758
Chivalry is dead.
You killed it, literally.

335
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,846
Junior: Hey!

336
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,199
Don't you ever put your hands
on my girl again.

337
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,766
I wouldn't have to
if she had a real man.

338
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,637
Oh, yeah?
Who's your real man...

339
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,904
[laughs] Okay.

340
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,557
All right. Yeah.

341
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:22,603
Yeah, you're a real man,

342
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:23,909
walking out on Mom and me
like you did.

343
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,867
Come on,
let it all out.

344
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,782
You know, I fucking
hated you growing up.

345
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,481
I wanted nothing
to do with you.

346
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,006
I hated you then,
and I fucking hate you now.

347
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,877
Whatever.
Shut up.

348
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,966
Get your head
back in the game.

349
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,402
Where is Mack?

350
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,100
He should be here by now.
Where the hell is he?

351
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:43,929
Let's go.

352
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:46,627
[Junior sighs]

353
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:02,861
Emmett.

354
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,646
-Emmett.
-What's up, man?

355
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:08,997
Are you familiar with
the Massacre of Thelonicus?

356
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,912
No, not at all.

357
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,740
Really?
Not at all?

358
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,176
Not at all, man.

359
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,743
Listen to this.

360
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,402
"The anger of the emperor

362
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:29,975
"for vengeance
by unsheathing his sword

363
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:33,065
"most unjustly
and tyrannically against all,

364
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:37,547
"slaying the innocent
and the guilty alike.

365
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:40,333
"It is said 7,000 perished
without any forms of law

366
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:44,337
"and without even having

passed upon them;

"they were alike...

369
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,914
So the emperor sounds
like a real dick.

370
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,916
I mean, what are
you trying to say?
You want me to kill everybody?

371
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,918
[laughs]

372
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:03,051
I get it.

373
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,538
Exactly what I'm saying.

374
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,196
Let it come.

[man gasping]

376
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,904
Man: Deep breath.

377
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,996
Breathe out.

378
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,868
Vet:
What the fuck are you doing?

379
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,959
-Mack: I'm interrogating him.
-By torturing him?

380
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:42,699
You sick fuck.
What is wrong with you?

381
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:46,007
Oh, man,
you've gone soft.

383
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:52,927
Fucking psycho.

384
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,932
The fuck you do that for?

385
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
He had Intel.

386
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:02,981
For the remainder of our time
in this warehouse,

387
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,113
your decision-making privileges
are suspended.

388
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:09,944
Now, if you two
did your jobs...

389
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,687
my target should be
somewhere upstairs.

390
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,123
Let's find her and get
the hell out of here.

391
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,607
[sighs]

392
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,704
[breathes deeply]

393
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,991
Can't let you leave.

394
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,601
I have to go, Tony.

395
00:33:59,776 --> 00:34:01,474
You know too much.

396
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:03,171
I won't talk.

397
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,174
You know me better than that.
I would never do that.

398
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,349
Take it up
with the big boss.

399
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,484
There's nothing left
for me here.

400
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,615
Please.

401
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,097
I'm sorry.

402
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:19,796
No.

403
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,190
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,619
It's that bitch
from the desert.

406
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,276
Let's fuck her up.

407
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,842
Hold on.

408
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,670
We flank her end,
easy breezy CoverGirl.

409
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,542
No, we're not
gonna do that.

410
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,587
-Why not?
-Because she's not the enemy.

411
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,634
I'm pretty sure that she's
the one firing at us right now.

412
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,897
She's protecting the target,
the same thing we're doing.

413
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,203
We're not gonna
kill her for that.

414
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:21,684
Sir, I'm pretty sure...

415
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,730
Hey, pretty sure
means shit to me.

416
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:27,037
You know what it means?
It means I got a half
a piece of ass.

417
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:31,129
All right, "pretty sure"
means that I don't know
what's going on. All right?

418
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,087
I want confirmed kills,
all right?

419
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,133
Get me confirmed kills. Go.

420
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,097
[grunting]

421
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,760
Send more men.

[laughs]

423
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,112
Hey, Vet, the toilets are
on their way.

424
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,635
You can clean them
tomorrow, okay?

425
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,159

428
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:09,602

430
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,273
She's fucking crazy.

431
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:30,579
Let's quit jerking around

432
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,277
and take this fucker out.

433
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,366
All right, Mack and I
are gonna go around.

434
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,237
We'll take her out
from the side, okay?

435
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,282
Let's go.

436
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:39,153
We're not murdering
this woman.

437
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,938
Not now, not ever.
Get it through your
goddamn heads!

438
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:50,295
What was that for?

439
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:51,861
Just ringing the doorbell.

440
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,346
What the hell was that?

441
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:00,957
It's World War III.

How many did he send?

446
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,138
All of them.

447
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,272
Anything I can do to help?

448
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:07,285
Be careful.

449
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:10,288
Vet:
I'm going after the target.

450
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,551
Go back to the base.

451
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,335
Take defensive positions.

452
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,641
Do not engage.

453
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,078
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

454
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,819
Let's go.
Be smart.

-Hands!
-You got me.

Everyone's time to come,
I suppose.

460
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,184
You always dress like this
when you're being hunted?

461
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,447
Put this on.
This ain't no bathing beach.

462
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:13,367
You're not gonna kill me?

463
00:40:17,153 --> 00:40:18,938
No.

Well, well, well.

be interesting.

00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,594
Use him as a carpet.

You know...

00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:45,040

I'm gonna have Vet Jones
for a rug.

we gonna do her?

Oh, we're gonna do her
all right.

We're gonna do her...

491
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:16,985
and then we're gonna
do her again.

you in here.

-No.
-Then don't worry about it.

to that.

-Yeah.

tell me your name?

does it make?

right now.

542
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:25,304
Where's your friend?

543
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:26,609
He went off on his own.

544
00:46:26,653 --> 00:46:27,741
We haven't seen him since.

545
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:31,876
Thanks.

546
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:32,964
Let's go.

547
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,706
Hey.

548
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,230
We're not done.

549
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,415
I need you for something.
You up for it?

550
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:51,939
What is it?

551
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,252
Vet: Guard her.

552
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,298
What are you guys
gonna do?

553
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:05,083
We're gonna go find Mack.

554
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:06,649
Can you handle it?

555
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,826
Aye.

556
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,567
Where have I seen
you two before?

557
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,832
We tried to kill you
a few days ago.

558
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,052
Sorry about that.

559
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,534
Yeah, your bodyguard
shot me.

560
00:47:23,144 --> 00:47:24,798
You all right
on ammo?

561
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:29,107
Inside.

562
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,325
In there?

563
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:31,544
Yeah, where else?

564
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,589
[laughs]
No fucking way.

565
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,156
Ruby, come on.

566
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,202
Hey, why don't you
get in, Junior?

567
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:40,814
Or better yet,
why don't you get in?
I'll go find Mack.

568
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,643
It's for your own safety.

569
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:46,559
I can keep myself safe.

570
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:49,823
The lioness does the hunting,
in case you've forgotten.

571
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,347
[sighs]
All right, let's go.

572
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:01,052
A lioness hunts...

573
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:03,924
while the lion sits
on his ass.

574
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:09,408
[speaks French]

575
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:15,370
What?

576
00:48:32,344 --> 00:48:33,998
[gagging]

577
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,445
How's the arm?

578
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:50,840
What do you care?

579
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,582
I asked, didn't I?

580
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:57,630
[sighs]
Look.

581
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,719
You can skip
the small talk, okay?

582
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:08,946
Sitting in a toilet.

583
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,469
Classy.

584
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,255
Excuse me?

585
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,476
I don't sit in shit
for no men.

586
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:19,739
Well, good for you,

587
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:21,480
but that man
just saved my life.

588
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:24,700
Doesn't mean you have
to do whatever he says.

589
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:26,180
Yes, it does.

590
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:30,184
See, I don't question shit
in the middle of an operation.

591
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:32,186
You stink.

592
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,101
So?
I'll take a shower.

593
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:36,974
A shower cannot
fix this stink.

594
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:00,345
You done
fucked up now, boy.

595
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:03,304
[groans]

596
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,360
[screams]

597
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,156
You got one shot.

598
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,029
Make it count.
Come on.

599
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:44,171
There we go.

600
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:45,825
Come on, it's almost over.
You're all right.

601
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:47,131
You're all right.
You're all right.
Come on.

602
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:50,090
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.

603
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:51,048
Stand up.

604
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,981
Ruby:
If you give them an inch,
they take a mile.

605
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,898
You have to challenge men
every step of the way,

606
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:17,639
or they lose respect
for you.

607
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:20,381
[laughing]

608
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:21,904
What?

609
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:24,472
You just have a disease,
that's all.

610
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:28,694
It's called early 20s
bougie bitch issues.

611
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,087
Wow.

612
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:33,133
When did you come up
with that?

613
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,092
While you were sitting
in the toilet?

614
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:38,007
No, it's written
all over your face.

615
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,793
You scream it every time
you open up your mouth.

616
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,230
Okay.

617
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:45,102
-You wanna settle this...
-Like men?

618
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,495
No, thank you.

619
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:52,065
[speaking French]

620
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,110
Say what?

621
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:56,069
Nothing, bitch.

622
00:51:57,375 --> 00:52:00,029
When is your sex-change
operation scheduled?

623
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,118
Hmm?

624
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:04,208
[gunshots]

625
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,212
As I was saying...

626
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:10,953
women are stronger
than men.

627
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,607
That's what you
don't understand.

628
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,523
Whatever, Ruben.

629
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,095
Junior: Mack?

630
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,273
Mack!

631
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:43,856
-We should bury him.
-No.

632
00:52:46,946 --> 00:52:48,904
I'm gonna bury him
out back.

633
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:50,732
The cops will just
dig him up again.

634
00:52:50,776 --> 00:52:52,125
He was my friend!

635
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,475
I can't just leave him here.

636
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:57,217
This is where he belongs.

637
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,914
He died like he lived.

638
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,220
Let him rest in peace.
Let's go.

639
00:53:06,618 --> 00:53:08,228
It can't be like this.

640
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,752
It is exactly like this.

641
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:13,190
There are no 21-gun salutes
in this business.

642
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:16,193
Now, find Ruby
and wait for me.

643
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,718
Where are you going?

644
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,198
To end it.

645
00:53:23,635 --> 00:53:26,246
Shut up.
I don't want
to hear you anymore.

646
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:32,426
No worries, a strong man
will come and save you,
fragile woman.

647
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:35,037
[footsteps, panting]

648
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,916
Hey, baby.
What happened?

649
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,356
It's Mack.
He's dead.

650
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:51,793
What?

651
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,361
How?

652
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,580
They shot him.

653
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,019
Why didn't you save him?

654
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:01,325
You should have
saved him!

655
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:03,109
Got there too late.

656
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,591
Where is he?
I want to see him.

657
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:07,940
You can't.
It's not safe.

658
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:09,681
I don't care.
I have to see him.

659
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,553
-Ruby.
-No, I don't care.
I have to see him!

660
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:15,817
-Where is he?
-We have to stay here.
We're moving out in minutes.

661
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:17,254
I don't care.

662
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,256
[speaks French]
Where is he?

663
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,649
Listen, please.
Stop shrieking.

664
00:54:21,693 --> 00:54:24,304
I'm not shrieking,
and don't you dare
tell me what to do.

665
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,743
Fine!

666
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:30,789
I'll find him myself.

667
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,313
-I'm coming with you.
-Don't.

668
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,488
I want to be alone.

669
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:46,239
[sighs]

670
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,766
She just doesn't listen!

671
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,465
I know.

672
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,206
You know?

673
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,382
What is it you know?

674
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,166
Hmm?

675
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:02,386
You said, "I know."
What is it that you know?

676
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:05,650
Well, I was just...
agreeing with you.

677
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:07,565
[scoffs]
I know she doesn't listen.

678
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:09,349
You don't know anything.

679
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,830
What could you possibly know
about my girlfriend?

680
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:14,398
In fact, what are you doing
outside of your toilet?

681
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:17,575
I was just trying to tell you
what she told me.

682
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:20,447
What did she tell you?

683
00:55:23,276 --> 00:55:25,365
Nothing.
She's just, uh...

684
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,281
-strongheaded, that's all.
-What did she tell you?

685
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,456
Specifically.

686
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:33,199
Speak, woman!

687
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,291
She said...

688
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,119
she wears the pants.

689
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,341
-You know what?
-Wait! What?

690
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,301
Okay.
Stay put.

691
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,370
[choking]

692
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,810

[groans]

695
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,672
Emmett!

696
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:13,941
Not Emmett.

697
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,255
[grunts]

698
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,784

[groans]

700
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,942
Vet: Emmett!

701
01:00:01,032 --> 01:00:02,642
Emmett!

702
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,645
Emmett!

703
01:00:14,654 --> 01:00:15,699
Drum.

704
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:21,748
What's up, janitor?

705
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,884
Welcome back.

706
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,150
-You gonna play with me?
-You're a sick fuck.

707
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:34,369
What's that make you, huh?

708
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,068
What's that make you?

709
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,636
An angel?

710
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,727
I'm not a pimple on your ass
when it comes to killing.

711
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,293
Isn't that what
you used to say?

712
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:48,383
Oh, wait, you retired.

713
01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:52,257
Yeah, that's right.
So what does that...
does that clean the slate?

714
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,781
All this carnage
is your fault.

715
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:56,696
Yeah, you broke
that contract,

716
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:59,264
so you're the reason
why all this is happening.

717
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:01,092
It's blood on your hands.

718
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,705
You're even more destructive now
than you were when you're...

719
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,924
when you were
in your prime, man.

720
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,665
And you retired.
What the fuck does that say?

721
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,145
-This ends here.
-Yeah, of course it does.
I know it ends today.

722
01:01:13,321 --> 01:01:14,671
But I'm gonna
give you an option.

723
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,718
I'm gonna give you one chance
to walk away and surrender.

724
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,633
Leave with a little bit
of dignity.

725
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,766
Otherwise...

726
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:23,680
it won't be pretty.

727
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,682
I promise you.

728
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:32,836
[grunts]

729
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,362
We're even.

730
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:47,851
[groans]

731
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,841
[echoing thud]

732
01:04:22,946 --> 01:04:25,513
Viejo over radio:
Emmett, what the fuck's
going on?

733
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,390
Vet over radio: Viejo.

734
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,701
Come on, motherfucker!

735
01:04:50,321 --> 01:04:51,888
Let it come.

736
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,010
Fuck!

737
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,757
-They got Ruby.
We gotta go.
-Where?

738
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:36,933
They took her in a car.
Let's go.

739
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:38,673
-Is she alive?
-Yeah, let's go!

740
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:40,414
-Fuck.
-Asshole.

741
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:41,633
Do you want her dead?

742
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,982
Calm the fuck down!

743
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:44,766
They're not gonna kill her.

744
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,333
They're taking her
to Viejo.

745
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:48,466
Well, let's go.
We can still catch her.

746
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:50,207
No, actually we can't.

747
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,600
See what happens when you don't
control your woman?

748
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:53,906
Dumb bitch.

749
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,519
Call Ruby a bitch again.

750
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:01,958
Viejo over radio:
Hey, Vet.

751
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:04,656
Is that you?
That is you.

752
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:09,313
She's of no interest
to me.

753
01:06:11,228 --> 01:06:13,491
Viejo over radio:
Yeah, well, tell faggot boy
I'm gonna mail her

754
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,101
to him in pieces, okay?

755
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,192
What do you want?

756
01:06:20,454 --> 01:06:22,021
Viejo:
You know what I want.

757
01:06:37,602 --> 01:06:39,996
Vet: You did good back there,
no matter what I say.

758
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:41,954
Junior:
No, I fucked up.

759
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,912
I let them take Ruby.

760
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:45,305
Vet:
Stop killing people.

761
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:51,050
I'm gonna kill
every motherfucker
that I see.

762
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:55,359
After this, I leave.

763
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,756
-Are you listening to me?
-What?

764
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,063
Uh... no.

765
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,978
No, not really.

766
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,806
What do you care anyway?

767
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:08,981
We're all going to hell.

768
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,592
This is hell.

769
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,464
I live
my punishment every day.

770
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,381
Haven't slept through
the night in 20 years.

771
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:22,603
Yeah, well,
I sleep very well.
Thank you.

772
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:26,042
That's nothing
to be proud of, son.

773
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:28,392
But I don't believe you.

774
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:32,048
You haven't crossed
that line yet.

775
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:34,050
I can tell
by looking in your eyes.

776
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,269
You still got
your humanity.

777
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:37,531
It's not too late.

778
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:12,844
Oh, fuck.

779
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:16,935
[muffled screaming]

780
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,893
No, no, no!
We have to save her!

781
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:20,199
No!

782
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:21,418
Vet: You can't go in there.

783
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,290
God damn it!
Fuck!

784
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:26,118
God!

785
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,526
Take me instead.

786
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,310
Viejo:
Shut the fuck up, asshole.

787
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:45,616
Put that down.

788
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:55,713
Let the girl go.
It's me you want.

789
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,410
Viejo:
You know what I want?

790
01:09:57,454 --> 01:10:01,197
Bring me what I want,
and I'll give you
what you want.

791
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,547
Where are you?

792
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,202
Start walking south.

793
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:10,554
I'm staying with Ruby.

794
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:14,993
I have to do this.

795
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,345
Good luck then.
Be careful.

796
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:26,700
[mumbles]

797
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,968
Are you fucking crazy?

798
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:35,535
You've got to get
out of here.

799
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:37,276
Stop fucking around
and get out of here!

800
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,451
-You can't help me!
-I gotta...

801
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:39,757
I can take care
of myself!

802
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,932
I gotta figure this out.

803
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,194
-Junior!
-Shut up!

804
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:49,810
Don't you ever speak to me
or interrupt me like that again.

805
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,339
-It's just...
-Ah! Don't interrupt me.

806
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,256
You and I are getting
out of here together, okay?

807
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,302
I'm not gonna let you
fucking die here.

808
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,219
So get it through
your fucking head.

809
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:17,316
-Are you with me?
-Aye.

810
01:11:21,668 --> 01:11:23,017
Are we in this together?

811
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:25,716
Oui, baby.

812
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:41,384
15 minutes.
If I'm not back,

813
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:42,994
I want you to drive
far and fast.

814
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:45,344
Don't look back.
Don't come back.

815
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:48,434
-Can I do anything to help?
-No, stay.

816
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,804
Viejo:
Hey, Vet. Vet!

817
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:12,763
You fucking screwball.

818
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,687
Let it come, motherfucker.

819
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:25,123
Come and get me!

820
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:38,092
Throw the gun forward.

821
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:30,797
[laughs]

822
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,279
Where is she?

823
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:37,021
She's gone.
It's just me.

824
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,807
I told you just to...
I told you just to bring her.

825
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:41,852
I...

826
01:13:42,853 --> 01:13:44,985
She's long gone, Viejo.
It's just me.

827
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,683
Me for her.
It's an even trade.

828
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:52,689
I said...

829
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:55,300
don't fuck with me!

830
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:58,434
Now you fucked with me.

831
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:02,438
Let it go, Viejo.

832
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,533
What the fuck is it
with you guys, huh?

833
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:11,490
What the fuck is it
with you guys?

834
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,406
All noble and shit
all of a sudden?

835
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:17,496
What the fuck, man?

836
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,758
You're going to hell.

837
01:14:20,325 --> 01:14:21,587
Deal with it.

838
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,590
You ain't getting out of it now
with the way you've been,

839
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:27,375
especially saving the life
of some fucking cheating whore.

840
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,422
You're going to hell,

841
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,032
because if you're
going to heaven...

842
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:34,687
[laughs]

843
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:36,341
...so am I.

844
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:38,865
They're gonna make me St. Peter
in charge of the gate, fuckface.

845
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:57,667
[muffled shouting]

846
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,328
[panting]

847
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,299
You sure you know
what you're doing?

848
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:24,389
Positivity, please.

849
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,524
I'm just saying.

850
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:29,655
Don't just say.

851
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:32,571
Why don't you focus
on your job?

852
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:35,574
What's my job?

853
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:38,534
Silence.

854
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,629
Okay.

855
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:50,720
-[snips]
-[both gasp]

856
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,549
Okay?

857
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:56,595
Hang on,

858
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:57,901
motherfucker.

859
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:00,643
Come again?

860
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:04,516
[laughing]

861
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,127
Oh, yeah.

862
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,653
Special guest.

863
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:14,047
What?

864
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:16,789
Look at your scrawny
fucking punk ass now.
You have lost a step.

865
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:20,837
You have.

866
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,970
You ain't got nothing to say?
You ain't talking.

867
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,671
Hey, look.

868
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:30,368
I live by a code.

869
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,196
I live by a code, man.

870
01:16:32,762 --> 01:16:36,069
Ain't nobody forcing anybody
to join up with this life.

871
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:40,508
And if they do want to join?

872
01:16:40,552 --> 01:16:41,684
Amen.

873
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:44,600
They know
the consequences.

874
01:16:45,513 --> 01:16:47,472
You kill people for money.

875
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:49,213
So does the government.

876
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:50,388
That makes it okay?

877
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:54,958
A man's gotta eat.

878
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:57,308
-[Ruby breathing heavily]
-[Junior whispering]

879
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:05,446
-[sighs]
-Okay.

880
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,623
All right.

881
01:17:25,902 --> 01:17:28,078
Let Ruby go.
You don't need her anymore.

882
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:32,343
You know, I've been
thinking that too.
I don't need her.

883
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:34,562
You know, I don't.

884
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:37,696
-Fuck you.
-[explosion]

885
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,050
Badavich.

886
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:52,493
Viejo: Get your hands off her,
or I'll kill you.

887
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:57,368
[laughing]

888
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,773
15 fucking years,
and not even a kiss goodbye?

889
01:18:13,776 --> 01:18:16,604
A kiss on the cheek? Huh?

890
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:20,739
A phone call?

891
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:24,700
Come on, girl.
A motherfucking text?

892
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,228
You're cold.
You're cold.

893
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:34,231
It can't be
like it was before.

894
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:43,719
You tell that to Tony?

895
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,680
You would have never
let me leave.

896
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:51,770
You're god damn right
I wouldn't let you leave.

897
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:53,119
Why would I
let you leave?

898
01:18:54,686 --> 01:18:56,601
Till death do us part.
Remember that, honey?

899
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,343
We took vows
in the eyes of the Lord.

900
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:03,869
[sighs]
I kept mine.

901
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:08,308
I was never
gonna talk.

902
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,530
I didn't care if you did.
I loved you.

903
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:15,838
And that's bullshit anyway.

904
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,149
Well...

905
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,414
You got what you wanted.

906
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:31,114
No, I didn't.

907
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,291
Don't turn this around on me.

908
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:36,641
You got what you wanted.

909
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:41,994
I wanted to live with you,
and love you in holy matrimony,

910
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,953
and I'm not getting it, am I?

911
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:45,476
No.

912
01:19:50,437 --> 01:19:51,699
I'm sorry.

913
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:53,223
The fuck you are.

914
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:57,880
You fucking lousy-ass bitch.
You're sorry for me?

915
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,360
That's all you got for me
after 15 fucking years?

916
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:03,537
You and this piece of shit?

917
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,890
That your boyfriend?

918
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,369
Hmm? Hmm?

919
01:20:09,413 --> 01:20:11,371
Maybe I ought
to kill him, huh?

920
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:17,813
You're both professional liars.

921
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,771
Be sorry about a fucking thing
but getting caught.

922
01:20:21,381 --> 01:20:22,905
Don't jive with
your new morality, does it?

923
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:26,169
But look,

924
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:27,953
you shouldn't have to be sorry
because I loved you,
and I love you,

925
01:20:27,997 --> 01:20:29,781
but I will see you in hell.

926
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:33,306
Okay?

927
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:37,354
Kill this bitch.

928
01:21:01,726 --> 01:21:03,032
Target:
I still don't know your name.

929
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:07,253
Vet: It's John.

930
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:11,127
Target:
Nice meeting you.

931
01:21:13,694 --> 01:21:14,870
Isabella.

932
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:16,175
Nice meeting you,
Isabella.

933
01:21:19,309 --> 01:21:20,701
Thanks.

934
01:21:20,745 --> 01:21:21,920
You're welcome.

935
01:21:26,142 --> 01:21:28,927
