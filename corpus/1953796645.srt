1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,939
Astronaut Forrest...
you give us hope.

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,036
And your great accomplishment...

3
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,775
will be edged
in the history of mankind.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,379
You're not alone.

5
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:02,417
People from all over the world
are keeping their eyes on you.

6
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:06,124
So please, don't lose
your hope and faith.

7
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,399
We'll be praying for you...

8
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,768
and your safe journey home.

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:52,135
What is it that inspires
mankind to take great risk?

10
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,676
Why is it that throughout
history...

11
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,311
humans have been driven
to explore distant uncharted
places...

12
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,584
despite the possibility
of no return?

13
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:13,189
In the case of Europa, the icy,
mysterious moon of Jupiter...

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,826
that inspiration came
in the form of photographs.

15
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,201
Photographs that revealed life.

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,548
These ghostly images gave the
entire human race unrepentant
knowledge...

17
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,551
that life as we know it
is not an isolated event...

18
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,454
reserved merely for Earth.

19
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,552
But rather a miracle that
is pervasive throughout
the cosmos.

20
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,700
And for the first time
since the 1970's...

21
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,901
humankind, once again, sought
to set foot on a distant world.

22
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,142
Hey, kids.

23
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,743
Um, I want to know, how do you
go to the bathroom in space?

24
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,879
I'll answer this one. Check
this out. We have a small--

25
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,187
Actually, there is a little bit
of gravity on the ship...

26
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,592
so, so going to the bathroom...

27
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,324
in space is a lot like going
to the bathroom on Earth.

28
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,893
Well, I think the kids would
enjoy how number one works.

29
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,164
Next question.

30
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,178

In the days after NASA retired
the space shuttle program...

31
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,841
and since the abandonment
of the International Space
Station...

32
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,350
the world has had to turn
to private enterprise...

33
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,616
when it comes to getting man
back into space.

34
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,691
The most influential name in
space exploration has been...

35
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,283
without a doubt,
Walter Moffitt.

36
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,086
Whales on Europa.

37
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,792
Yes... every time I see these
latest pictures...

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,925
man, it gives chills
down my spine.

39
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,470
Which brings me to my next
question... of pictures.

40
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,300
Mm-hm.

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,068
We have dozens
and dozens of pictures.
Lots of pictures.

42
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:08,307
NASA is preparing a submersible
rover to dive under the ice.

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,047
NASA and its rover...

44
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,245
My name is Gavin Hayden.

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,619
Why aren't you wearing
any spacesuits?

46
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,250
The space suits, or EVAs...

47
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,658
are used for extra-vehicular
activities...

48
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,754
so, that would be outside
the ship.

49
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,824
But I suppose they could be
used in an emergency.

50
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,495
About two hours worth
of life support.

51
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:37,404
Charlie, it takes NASA
a year just to pass gas.

52
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,775
They have quadruple redundancy
in everything they do...

53
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,644
in their engineering chain,
and you name it.

54
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,275
I have respect for NASA,
but by the time their rover...

55
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,819
gets there, our boys
will be on their way home.

56
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,983
 To accomplish
the 13-year mission to explore
the distant world...

57
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:57,860
astronauts Nathan Miller and
Michael Forrest are placed into
a deep sleep for six years...

58
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,865
as their space craft races
from planet to planet...

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,629
before speeding off to Europa.

60
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:08,163
There they will spend one year
in a state-of-the-art
facility...

61
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:12,268
studying the newly discovered
species of alien giants...

62
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,973
before finally returning home.

63
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,849
My name's Emily. Um, aren't
you going to Venus, 'cause
that's the wrong way?

64
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,117
That is actually
a very astute question.

65
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,489
Um, it has to do with the
orbital ellipses of the
planets...

66
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,360
and a very concerted effort
on the part of the scientists,
as well as ourselves...

67
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,993
to increase the speed of the
ship using not only the earth's
gravitational pull...

68
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,536
but Venus as well.

69
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,400
Yeah, so what I think my
colleague is trying to say...

70
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,496
it's all about going fast.

71
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,805
So what we're gonna do is spin
around Venus to pick up speed...

72
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,141
then slingshot
from Venus to Earth.

73
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,011
As we get even more speedage,
we're off to Jupiter.

74
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,246
Faster than ever.
Sounds cool, huh?

75
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:58,586
Isn't the redundancy exactly
what is needed here for safety?

76
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,923
There are those who criticize
you who say that you rushed
this mission.

77
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,156
This is not meant to be
a disclaimer...

78
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:10,498
but everybody knows how I feel,
you know, that I'm very
protective of my men.

79
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,198
Columbus went around the world.
Magellan sailed around the whole
planet.

80
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,673
We got guys going to the moon.
They rushed them to the moon.

81
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,108
And that was for a reason.

82
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,940
We need somebody there.

83
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,743
We need somebody to put their
foot in the dust of the moon.

84
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,182
Like many brave explorers
before them...

85
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,413
the two-men crew of Life One...

86
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,584
entrust their lives to their
tiny vessel and to each
other...

87
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,424
for a chance to witness
the extraordinary.

88
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:42,025
It has been called the most
dangerous whale watching
expedition in history.

89
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,466
When you see the planet...

90
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,300
what does it look like
outside the window?

91
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,372
It looks like stars.

92
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,312
We have heard that this mission
has cost you personally...

93
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,780
50 billion dollars.

94
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,146
It cost me a lot.

95
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,787
But look, that's what
we're here for.

96
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,652
That's what we're working,
that's the whole deal.

97
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,882
Think about this for a minute.

98
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,586
These boys are travelling
at the speed of a .45 bullet.

99
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,754
They're sound asleep.

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,597
They're gonna go around Venus,
past Earth, and then start
orbiting Jupiter.

101
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,602
What a miracle.

102
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,503
They'll see the whales
of Europa.

103
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,972
But they'll be seeing it
with their eyes.

104
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,636
It won't be photographs
from NASA.

105
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,512
Your a man who's wealthy enough
to do anything he wants to do.

106
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:35,576
Why aren't you up there
with those men right now?

107
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:40,354
Charlie, I've done everything
I've wanted to do... just about.

108
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,951
I'm a bit long in the tooth.

109
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,691
I would'a, could'a, should'a...

110
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,961
but it really isn't about me.

111
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,526
It's about future generations.

112
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,867
Can I ask a question?

113
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,703
How is it that you plan
to spend your free time?

114
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,175
Space pong.
We actually won't have
a lot of free time.

115
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,803
Now ping pong in space--

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,814
We're gonna be doing
experiments 24/7.

117
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,873
Not to mention
a lifetime of study.

118
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,782
Having to cram that
into just one year, so--

119
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,483
Yeah, but in our free time,
I will be in my space suit...

120
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:15,391
sitting on my porch, reading
from my pocket Shakespeare...

121
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,329
by the light of Jupiter
on the horizon.

122
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,992
Um, that sounds beautiful.
Thank you.

123
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,299
Well, I guess it's time
for us to go.

124
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,568
We have a lot of work to do
before we go to sleep.

125
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,666
Thank you for your
wonderful question.

126
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,974
Bye-bye.

127
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,015
Thank you, kids.
We'll see you guys in six years.

128
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,199
Nathan!

129
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,596
OMS thrusters check?

130
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,234
OMS thrusters... check.

131
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,211
Hey, pal, how we doing?

132
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,111
I am doing just fine.

133
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,131
This is Life One
to Mission Control.

134
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,837
There is a leak in the main
habitation chamber.

135
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,742
I sealed the capsule
and I'm suiting up.

136
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,908
I'll be out of communications
for-- until further notice.

137
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,748
Nathan Miller is dead.

138
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,656
Life One out.

139
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,674
Life One,
this is Mission Control.

140
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,310
We received
your emergency beacon.

141
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,982
We're analyzing all of the data
pouring in right now.

142
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,185
As soon as we have some answers
for you, we'll get back to you.

143
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,560
Acknowledge receipt of this
message. Mission Control out.

144
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,665
Life One, this is Mission
Control. We have multiple
failures of the hull...

145
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,297
in both the capsule
and the habitation module.
We recommend suiting up--

146
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,897
This is Life One to Mission
Control.

147
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,068
There is a leak in the main
habitation chamber.

148
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,612
I've sealed the capsule
and am suiting up.

149
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,582
I'll be out of communications
for 12 hours.
That's great, you're on it.

150
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,118
We'll keep sending more
information as it comes in.

151
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,677
Mission Control out.

Life One out.

152
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,522
This is Life One.

153
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,153
The main habitation
chamber is secure.

154
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:13,431
The hibernation
and reentry capsule... is--

155
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,678
I'm sorry, I don't know
who you are, um...

156
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:26,651
Can you find me Ben Elliot
or... Bob Jansen?

157
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,277
Would be great.

158
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,515
This is Life One out.

159
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,999

Space travel is inherently
dangerous.

160
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,126
There could always be a problem.

161
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,639
Let's say on the first leg,
heading towards Venus...

162
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:51,335
or on the second leg, going
from Venus back to Earth...

163
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,742
aborting the mission
would be relatively simple.

164
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,576
We'd just come home.

165
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:02,552
We'd actually be asleep at the
time, so we probably wouldn't
know that there was a problem.

166
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:07,558
Of course, after we make that
last push around Earth and head
towards Jupiter...

167
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,719
well, there's really
no going back.

168
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,162
Life One,
this is Mission Control.

169
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:20,899
We have Robert Jansen
to come in and talk to you
face-to-face.

170
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,932

All right, great, thanks.

171
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,841
Michael?
It's Life One.

172
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,039
No, it's Michael,
and you're Adam and I'm Bob...

173
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,547
so let's cut the jargon.

174
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,017
Michael, hi, it looks like
the space craft...

175
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,853
was more than likely hit
by a micro-meteorite.

176
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,519
Information is coming in and
we're doing our best to process
it as quickly as possible.

177
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,755
Just know that I am here...

178
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,960
and as I know anything,
I will transmit back to you.

179
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,433
Bob out.

180
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,369
This is Life One.

181
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,036
It's good to see you, Bob.

182
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,381
Damage report.

183
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,577
Life support is solid.

184
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,984
And oxygen is holding,
for now.

185
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,888
The habitation module
is stabilized and we're at 1.0
of earth gravity.

186
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:18,794
So whatever hit us, must have
not been big enough to knock
us off our spin.

187
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,664
The central fuel tank
and booster engine are
in the numbers.

188
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,736
Nuclear reactor remains
unbreached...

189
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,000
and all radiation shielding
is functioning well.

190
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,976
Europa habitation ballast array
and all contents including ice
drill platform.

191
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:38,278
Inflatable habitat
and mini submersible
are reading 1 00 percent.

192
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,084
Looks like the only thing
that we lost, actually...

193
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,590
was the hibernation
and reentry capsule.

194
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,132
I'll do another diagnostic check
and I'll be in touch.

195
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,998
Thanks, Bob.

196
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,833
Life One out.

197
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,714
Life One,
this is Mission Control.

198
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,944
We have an update
on the situation...

199
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,183
but Mr. Moffitt would like
to deliver this message himself.

200
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,983
Thank you.

201
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,722
Michael... Walter Moffit.

202
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,298
Listen, first of all...

203
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:38,173
we deeply regret
the loss of Nathaniel.

204
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:42,407
And there's not much you can say
about a thing like this...

205
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,848
but Mr. Jeffs has taking over
for Mr. Elliot...

206
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,183
who passed away about two years
ago in a heart attack.

207
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,392
A lot's changed since
you've been gone.

208
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,888
And on that note, we've decided
to abort the mission.

209
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,835
I'm looking forward
to talking to you.

210
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,769
Mission out.

211
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,068
Hi, Mike, my name is Irwin
and this is my family...

212
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,900
Mila and Drew.

213
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,374
We'd just like to thank you for
being our eyes in another world.

214
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,638
Bye!
Bye!

215
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,269
Bye.

216
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,710

This is Life One.

217
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:59,724
I have received your message
and am aborting the mission
to Europa.

218
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,954
Given our current position,
we will continue our present
course...

219
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:08,557
past Venus as scheduled and
toward Earth as scheduled.

220
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,797
At which point,
we will execute a Leg 3 abort...

221
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,931
scrapping the slingshot maneuver
to Europa... from Earth.

222
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,012
I'll make the changes necessary
for our break in procedure...

223
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,139
and preparation for reentry...

224
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,150
and thereby an end
to the mission.

225
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,151
This is Life One out.

226
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,760
Okay, this is all very exciting.

227
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,920
Hey, ease up, man.
Smile!

228
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,624
It's for the kids.
It's good PR, hit the button.

229
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,334

This is Life One.

230
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,712
It's been 24 hours
since the accident.

231
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,651
My hibernation sickness
is starting to wear off.

232
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,190
The food recycling system
is up and running.

233
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,627
We're at 1 00 percent.

234
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:16,828
Obviously most of the comforts
of home are locked away
in the Europa.

235
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,861
Habitation ballast array.

236
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,407
So I won't get
my comfortable chair.

237
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,672
But I am gonna miss my bed,
and the window for that matter.

238
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,245
We're only supposed to spend
a week to two weeks
in this chamber...

239
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,844
but we're just gonna
have to make it work.

240
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,556
We're just gonna
have to make it work.

241
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,660
This is Life One... out.

242
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:05,207
Michael? It's Bob... obviously.

243
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:11,244
It was important for me, right
now, to tell you that I need you
to get on a routine.

244
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,520
I need you to sleep. I need you
to eat three meals a day.

245
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,060
I need you to exercise.

246
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:22,033
It will be very, very important
for you and for me...

247
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,968
for you to do all of the work
that you can to stay sane up
there...

248
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,234
and to know that I am here
to talk to you...

249
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:35,405
or at least send you periodic
messages that at some point
in the future you'll respond to.

250
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,608
I'm here for you, buddy.
All right?

251
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,741
Bob out.

252
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,236
Niobium, Nb.

253
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,144
Bromine, Br.
Krypton, Kr.

254
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,342
Rubidium, Rb.

255
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,420
Strontium, Sr.

256
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,595
Hi, Michael, Bob here.
Just checking in.

257
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,125
You've got a lot of people
around here watching you.

258
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:37,164
In fact, you're pretty much
the biggest story in the world
right now.

259
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,040
Um, so I need to ask you...

260
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,512
can I have the exclusive rights
to your book?

261
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:49,487
But also, I was asked today
to ask you how you're feeling.

262
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,148
Seemed an odd question.

263
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,522
But then I realized
I hadn't asked you...

264
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,654
so... how are you?

265
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,823
How are you feeling?

266
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,460
Bob out.

267
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,043
This is Life One.

268
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,547
Diagnostics seem
to be going smoothly.

269
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,742
As of right now...

270
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,345
it'll probably take me
another three days to fully
check the entire ship.

271
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,322
At least this part of it anyway.

272
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,154
I've taken in
about 2,100 calories.

273
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,528
I have 600 to go.

274
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,366
I'm gonna try to keep it
at that level for the duration.

275
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,097
Done about 1 6 minutes
of exercise.

276
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,369
I think that's too much.

277
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,274
I'm gonna try to dial it
back for tomorrow.

278
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,917
Otherwise, we're just trying
to conserve our energy.

279
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,848
I'll get in a daily log tomorrow
about this same time.

280
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,621
Other than that,
we should be fine.

281
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,355
This is Life One... out.

282
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,886
Okay, Michael,
here's the situation.

283
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,483
You have a lot
on your plate right now...

284
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,052
but every single bit of it
is extremely important.

285
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,758
You've got a post-Venus engine
burn that needs to happen...

286
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:46,600
otherwise, you're going to spend
the rest of your life as Venus'
only real moon.

287
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:51,665
Unfortunately, from my end,
I am looking at an electrical
system that is completely fried.

288
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,836
And it needs to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

289
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,143
So you're going to have
to perform that engine burn
manually...

290
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:02,016
which obviously wasn't the way
things were meant to be.

291
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,645
The system's primary generator
is unstable, at best...

292
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,782
and you have got to keep the
power running.

293
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,793
You lose power and you will
freeze to death in a manner
of hours.

294
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,125
So be very careful.

295
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:17,362
Michael, what we have here
is a classic, old-school
Christmas light situation.

296
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:21,929
Remember at Christmas when you
were trying to get your
Christmas tree lights to work?

297
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,770
And they weren't, inexplicably.

298
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,107
So you had to go through every
single bulb and test it...

299
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:31,274
to get proper connection
in order for the lights
to light up?

300
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,045
Well that's what you're going
to have to do, alone...

301
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:38,486
with a 25 gazillion dollar
spaceship.

302
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,889
What I'm gonna need you to do is
I'm gonna need you to take all
of the control systems...

303
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,826
from the capsule and reroute
them to the habitation module.

304
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,729
The monitor that you're
looking at right now.

305
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,063
So let's take all of the systems
and let's reroute it there.

306
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,733
Now I hate to tell you this,
but this means that...

307
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,901
Michael, you're gonna need
to go back in the capsule...

308
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,980
and get your hands dirty.

309
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,178
It's gonna take you
a lot of time...

310
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:12,349
but, just like Christmas,
it'll be worth it in the end.

311
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,523
Bob out.

312
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,702
This is Life One,
received your message.

313
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,746
I understand
what you're saying, Bob...

314
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,840
but I think I can get to
everything I need to get to...

315
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,717
in the main habitation chamber.

316
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,348
If I go into that capsule,
I'm gonna have to get fully
suited up.

317
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,756
It's gonna be hard to work.

318
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:53,696
It may take extra time coming
from this way, but...

319
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,289
hell, I got plenty of time.

320
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,698
Frankly, I don't want to go in
that capsule if I don't have to.

321
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,966
So let's see what we can do
from this side.

322
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,545
This is Life One, out.

323
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,619
Life One,
this is Mission Control.

324
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,316
Um, it's me, Adam.

325
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:25,886
Um, I know you lost all your
music and entertainment data
with the death of the capsule.

326
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:30,924
So I put together some music
that I'm going to send up
to you now...

327
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:34,130
and I think you'll enjoy it.

328
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,609
No, no... uh--

329
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,908
No! No!

330
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,347
Surf's up
We're surfing every day now

331
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,783
Surf's up
The summer's here to stay now

332
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:56,290
Surfing till the sun's gone
away

333
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,158
This is Life One.

334
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,099
Turn it off and keep it off.
Life One out.

335
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,828
Turn it off and keep it off.
Life One out.

336
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:06,166
Surf's up
We're surfing every day now

337
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,933
Surf's up
The summer's here to stay

338
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:15,469
We'll be spending all our time
Surfing till the sun's gone
away

339
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,655

I started work on rerouting
the control panel today.

340
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,721
And happened to find
two ping pong paddles.

341
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:39,202
Ping pong ball and a book
of light reading.

342
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,497
Compliments of Nathan Miller.

343
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,710
Life One out.

344
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,557
It's in the toilet.

345
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,389
Astronaut Forrest...


346
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,727
On behalf of my family and with
love from all of our country...

347
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:27,203
we wish you a safe return and
you've been a really big
inspiration for all of us.

348
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,967
Please come back safely, okay?

349
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,683
Thank you, Kadru.
See you guys in six years!

350
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,880
And thanks again
for your great questions.

351
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,756
You did good.

352
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:57,864

Finished Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein... again.

353
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:02,872
Don't really care
for her poetry.

354
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,431
I'll move on
to Shakespeare tomorrow.

355
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,011
This is Life One out.

356
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,209
Jackson, Lincoln, Johnson,
Grant, Reagan, Bush...

357
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:17,277
Clinton, Bush, Obama, Raton.

358
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,789
Okay, first names... George--

359
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,861
Hi, Michael, it might be time
now to start thinking about...

360
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,455
performing some no-fire
engine burn test.

361
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,227
Just to check the connectivity
on the primary generator.

362
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:34,795
Let me know when you might be
ready to start testing and we'll
get ready on our end down here.

363
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,373
Bob out.

364
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,545
I've rerouted
the circuits from S-23.

365
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:47,983
I think we're about,
let's say ten days out...

366
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:54,389
before we'll be able to do
some kind of engine-burn test
on the new control panel.

367
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,158
This is Life One out.

368
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,097

This is Life One, daily log.

369
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,502
Did another ten minutes
of exercise.

370
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,972
That seemed to go pretty well.

371
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:15,001
2,400 calories consumed today.

372
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:19,914
I guess we'll call it a
late-night snack to finish up.

373
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:22,248
I've been eating...

374
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,816
candy corn-flavored paste
for the last 14 days.

375
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,259
I think we'll switch
to cheeseburger.

376
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,490
Life One out.

377
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,838
Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy...

378
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,978
Dopey... Doc. No--

379
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,147
Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy...

380
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:03,353
Dopey, Angry and Doc.

381
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:23,039
Gray-6, pull wire.

382
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,844
They're all gray, Bob.

383
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,716
Have eaten what
I'm supposed to eat today.

384
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,161
I have exercised as much
as I'm supposed to exercise.

385
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:46,761
I have been working on rerouting
this damn panel for I don't
know how long...

386
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:51,171
and I would love to have
just a little room to work.

387
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,268
Next time you build
one of these things...

388
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:59,111
maybe-- maybe...
a little elbow room.

389
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,054
Just a thought.

390
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,755
Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy...

391
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,399
Was one drunk?

392
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,901
Daily log 42.

393
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,071

Calisthenics, ten minutes.

394
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,442
Caloric intake, 2,700,
right on the money.

395
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:37,485
And happy to say that
Panel 17-OHG is finished.

396
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,613
So, put a big check mark
by that one.

397
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,649
We'll get to work
on 1 8-01HG tomorrow.

398
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,321
But today, I do believe
I am putting my feet up.

399
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,671
Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy.

400
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,082
Sleepy, Sneezy, Happy, Grumpy...

401
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,248
Dopey, Bashful and Doc.

402
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:41,042
We're about 24 hours from our
first engine-burn test.

403
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,516
I wouldn't get too excited,
I think we have a long way
to go.

404
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,661
Fortunately,
we got plenty of time.

405
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,899
Talk to you tomorrow.
This is Life One out.

406
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,736
This is test number one for an
engine burn after reconnection.

407
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:16,377
We are going in three,
two, one.

408
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,029
It's about what I expected.

409
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,060
This is Life One.
Test number one has failed.

410
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,832
We startin' over.

411
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,873
Hi, Michael, it's--

412
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,073
My name is Eric Hainen,
I'm from Haifa, Israel...

413
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,413
and in behalf of my family,
my town, my country...

414
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:52,354
I wish you best of luck
and a safe journey back home
from space.

415
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,549
Thank you.

416
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,789
Michael, standby.

417
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:04,596
I have an important message
to you from Mr. Moffitt.

418
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,262
I will be sending it
to you now.

419
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,104
Michael, this is Mr. M.

420
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,647
I got something
that might cheer you up.

421
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:23,414
We've compiled a short video
of well-wishers
from around the world.

422
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,149
I'd like to ask your permission
to transmit this up.

423
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:52,338
This is Life One
with an answer to your request.

424
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,949
No.

425
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,777
No, no, thank you.

426
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,859
Life One out.

427
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,299

Read a little Hamlet today.

428
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:23,676
He says there is nothing
either good or bad...

429
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:28,047
but thinking makes it so.

430
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,384
Question is, do you you change
your thinking or just try to
stop thinking all together?

431
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,194
This is Life One out.

432
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:46,796
Um, I want to know, how do you
go to the bathroom in space?

433
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,136
I don't know why you let
something like that bother
you so much.

434
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,337
It was a personal question
about my personal business.

435
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,878
Kid asked the question.

436
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,513
What do you want me
to tell them?

437
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:04,247
That every time we defecate,
our stool is reconstituted into
a paste that we eat for dinner?

438
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,879
It's flavored paste.

439
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,983
And you get to choose
your own flavor.

440
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,769
This is Life One, Day 1 82.

441
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,912
Six months.

442
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't know, Bob.

443
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,059
Should we be celebrating?

444
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,030
Okay, Michael,
everything appears to be 100
percent on track...

445
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,902
and you're getting
everything done, famously...

446
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,705
except that my data is showing
that there are issues
and problems...

447
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,905
that I don't understand...

448
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,107
so, let me do some more work...

449
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:09,949
and let me get back to you,
but stay the course,
things are improving.

450
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,248
Bob out.

451
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,893
Toronto...

452
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,162
Stockholm.

453
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,745
New York City.

454
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,489
Burlington...

455
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,290
Vermont.

456
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,823
Vermont...

457
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,468
Santiago, Chile...

458
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,973
Hollywood.

459
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,719
Hi, Michael, uh,
we've been quiet down here.

460
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:58,194
Just not wanting to put any
unnecessary pressure on--
on you.

461
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,693
We have some people
down here who...

462
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,897
want to know how close you
think you are to a second
engine-burn test.

463
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:16,375
So if you could, please kindly
confirm receipt of this message.

464
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,745
Bob out.

465
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:24,921
Uh... I'd say we are...

466
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,556
three weeks--

467
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:35,189
Three weeks out from our next
engine-burn test, so...

468
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,098
nobody get excited.

469
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,936
I'll check in again tomorrow.

470
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,939
That looks like that's
gonna take forever.

471
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,905
Bob, I need to talk
to you about something.

472
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,034
I, uh--

473
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:32,980
I know there's a vacuum
in that capsule.

474
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,009
I know that there's no sound
in that capsule. I know that
Nathan is dead...

475
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,216
but I hear something in there.

476
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,420
I can't figure out what it is.

477
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,335
And I'm starting to think
that it's me.

478
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,242
Life One out.

479
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:23,130
Astronaut Forrest...

480
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,633
what is it you plan to do
with your free time?

481
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,775
Michael? Bob here.

482
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:43,582
Listen, buddy, could you
do me a favor and just get
a little rest?

483
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,590
I know that you are working
very, very hard on this
repatch...

484
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:52,254
but there's no reason to push
yourself to do another
engine-burn test tomorrow.

485
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,330
Between you and me,
you have got plenty of time...

486
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:02,633
so let's just put it off
for a day or two.

487
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:09,009
Go to the beach,
drink a Mai Tai.

488
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,013
Just take a day off, okay?

489
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,743
Bob out.

490
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:19,312
I got about six more hours
on this repatch...

491
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:24,292
but we are doing this
engine-burn test tomorrow
come hell or high water.

492
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,956
That's all I got.

493
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,522
Life One out.

494
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,927
This is engine-burn
connection test number two.

495
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:41,638
Arming... in three, two, one.

496
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,497
Fuck!

497
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,802
This fucking--

498
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:44,162
Bob, I'm becoming concerned
about the failure of these
engine-burn tests.

499
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:49,178
I'm worried about the
ramifications.

500
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:41,180
We've got, uh...
about 2,500 calories...

501
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:45,718
taken in today and about
1 1 minutes calisthenics.

502
00:52:54,171 --> 00:53:00,167
There's a sound coming from the
hibernation and reentry capsule.

503
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,845
I don't know what it is.

504
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:13,879
Could you... take a look
at that for me?

505
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:18,485
Or give me some ideas
about what that could be?

506
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,099
Thanks.

507
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,896
Life One out.

508
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,244
Michael, this is Bob.

509
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:46,278
There is no reason that there
should be any sound coming
from the capsule.

510
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,754
The capsule is dead.

511
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,052
Now, listen to me.

512
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,219
You are not sleeping.

513
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:56,425
One friend to another,
you look like hell, bro.

514
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:01,402
So, get some rest, continue
eating, continue exercising.

515
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,376
You have to exercise not just
your body, Michael, but your
mind and get some rest.

516
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,470
That's my advice to you today.
Bob out.

517
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:24,486
Shut up, Nathan!
Shut up!

518
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,653
Goddamn it!

519
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,724
God--!

520
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:12,336
This is engine-burn test
number seven, three, two, one.

521
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,483
This is engine-burn test
number eight...

522
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:31,288
in three, two, one.

523
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:43,131
Test number 1 1
in three, two, one.

524
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:51,680
Number 1 4... in three, two, one.

525
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,518
Three, two, one.

526
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,268
In three, two, one.

527
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:34,586
This is engine-burn test
number 25...

528
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:38,184
in three, two, one.

529
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,859
Oh, baby.

530
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,720
Come on, come on, come on.

531
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,057
God--

532
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,330
No, no, no, no, no!

533
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:41,623
No, no.

534
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,319
1 632, 1 634...

535
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,160
no, that's all right.

536
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,995
Goddamn it, come on!

537
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,810
Wasn't a-- wasn't
a frayed wire, was it?

538
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:09,283
S-20, S-26, 27.

539
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,958
Ugh, it's not here.

540
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,987
Fuck, it's cold.

541
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,408
No, no, no, that's fine.
It's fine.

542
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,573
This isn't it.
This isn't it.

543
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,708
Come on.

544
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,377
Guidance systems, check.

545
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,573
Guidance system, check.

546
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,914
Hey, look, pal...

547
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,752
there's nobody else I'd rather
do this mission with.

548
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,290
I mean that.

549
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,831
Let's do this.

550
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,867
What are you doing?

551
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,810
This ain't the man I know.

552
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,983
Get the fuck up... Michael!

553
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:02,956
Michael, get up!

554
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,977
Michael, you--
you son of a bitch.

555
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:39,646
I-- I cannot believe
that you made it.

556
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,418
Uh, I lost a lot of money.

557
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,655
Um, be well, we'll do
the work we need to here...

558
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,322
and, uh, send us a message
when you can.

559
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,126
Bob out.

560
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:59,297

Yeah, I made it.

561
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,804
I'm alive anyway.

562
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,980
So what's next?

563
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:14,522
I still have a post-Venus
engine burn ahead...

564
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,321
and have yet to perform
a successful test.

565
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:26,328
And if I do get all the way
back to Earth...

566
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,700
I have to crawl back
into that capsule...

567
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:35,472
and hope that whatever
rudimentary interior repair
I do...

568
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,536
won't rupture on reentry.

569
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,513
And before that can happen...

570
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,691
I have years of this.

571
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,686
For what?

572
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:58,291
To say... I survived?

573
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,497
Sometimes I think...

574
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:12,037
if I could get these
engines fired up at all.

575
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,745
Maybe I shouldn't stop at Earth.

576
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,758
Maybe I should...

577
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,991
ride this thing...
all the way to Europa.

578
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:37,100
In a lot of ways...
I'm dead already.

579
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:45,277
Otherwise... yeah...

580
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,749
I made it...

581
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,919
but what's the point?

582
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,764
Astronaut Forrest, I just
want to thank you so much...

583
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:07,201
for being a tremendous
influence to me and my family.

584
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,737
We're so proud of you.

585
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,465
We wish you the very best...

586
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,905
and please,
have a safe journey home.

587
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,741
You're my hero.

588
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,749
Michael, Bob here.

589
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:12,089
Listen, buddy,
you are now nearing Venus...

590
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:18,724
and your ship is sending
back the most...

591
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,931
beautiful pictures
that I've ever seen.

592
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,102
Buddy, Venus is right outside
your ship right now...

593
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:32,670
and I-- I wanted
to implore you...

594
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,239
to-- to let me send you
the images.

595
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,777
It's amazing...
Bob out.

596
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,406
This is Michael Forrest
of Life One.

597
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:36,373
I have just seen Venus.

598
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:43,724
It's so close,
I feel like I can--

599
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,990
It's so close, I feel like
I can reach out and touch it.

600
01:12:56,572 --> 01:13:00,736
I'm millions of miles
from home.

601
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,505
My only companion is dead.

602
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,785
And I can't help but think...

603
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,286
that I'm the luckiest man alive.

604
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:22,929
I wish... that you
could see what I see.

605
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,735
This is Life One out.

606
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,829
This is Life One.

607
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:02,062
Standby for a post-Venus
engine burn.

608
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,798
Arming... in three...

609
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,444
two...

610
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:19,854
one.

611
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,786
That's the stuff.

612
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,219
Michael? It is official.

613
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,024
The Broncos have won
the Super Bowl.

614
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,496
No, not really.

615
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,328
Uh, you're on
your way home, buddy.

616
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,834
Two more years to go.

617
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:13,466
Maybe by the time you're home,
you'll be old enough to have
a beer with me.

618
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:16,010
Sleep well,
'cause I am going to bed.

619
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,841
Bob out.

620
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,714
Life One to Mission Control.

621
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:37,358
You remember that video
that Moffitt made for me?

622
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,161
Think you could track
that down?

623
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,098
I think I'd like
to see it now.

624
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,567
Thanks.

625
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:56,343
This message is for
Astronaut Michael Forrest.

626
01:15:56,418 --> 01:16:00,218
My name is Avery Grey.
I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.

627
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,628
Good luck, Michael,
in Chinese.

628
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,794
Hi, Michael...

629
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:23,638
Astronaut Forrest, I just want
to thank you so much...

630
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:28,978
for being a tremendous
influence to me and my family.
We're so proud of you.

631
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:33,953
We wish you a safe return and
you've been a really big
inspiration for all of us.

632
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,284
Please come back safely.

633
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:59,244
One-- one time, in school...

634
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,181
I was watching
one of your videos...

635
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,947
for a long time,
like, we're talking hours.

636
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,421
Um, and then
this teacher came in...

637
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,482
and she said,
""You're missing science class.""

638
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,497
And then I told her,
""I ain't missing nothing.

639
01:17:16,565 --> 01:17:20,934
""I'm watching Astronaut Michael
Forrest going to search for
space worlds.""

640
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,971
That sounds like science to me.

641
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,442
You're my hero.

642
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:42,490
Astronaut Forrest,
you are a great hero to the
Japanese people.

643
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:44,684
You give us hope.

644
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:49,720
And your great accomplishment
will be edged in the history
of mankind.

645
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:53,562
Sometimes I wonder
if you're scared.

646
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,229
You don't ever look scared...

647
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,502
but you might get stuck
up there...

648
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:05,535
and I just wanted to tell you,
don't be scared.

649
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,583
'Cause I'm gonna be
just like you.

650
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:14,179
And, if you get stuck,
I'll come and get you.

651
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,868
All right,
cross checks are complete.

652
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:32,373
We've run ten pressure-test
simulations and it appears
that your patch is solid.

653
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:37,105
The inflatable aero-shell
is 1 00 percent,
was never compromised...

654
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,841
so you've got yourself
a heat shield.

655
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,248
You can start warming up the
capsule for the ride home.

656
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:45,081
Really, at any time,
all systems are go...

657
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:48,520
with power generator running
at 99.6 percent.

658
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,583
Truly, a hell of a job, you've
got her purring like a kitten.

659
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,792
So this is it.

660
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,867
Time to say goodbye
to the HAB MOD.

661
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,267
Time to say goodbye
to Life One.

662
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,304
Listen, Michael, um...

663
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,638
I'm proud to have been
here with you.

664
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,872
Thanks, Bob.

665
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,881

I couldn't have done
it without you.

666
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,752
That is so true.

667
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,755
It's been my pleasure.

668
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,722
Okay, standby.

669
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,424
All that's left to do is fire
the engines for the breaking
procedure.

670
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,660
We'll see you after splashdown.

671
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,099
Bob out.

672
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,307
Life One to Mission Control.

673
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,181
Life One to Mission Control.

674
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:28,048
Mission Control, over.

675
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:33,557
Jeffs, how you doing, buddy?

676
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,893
Listen, I need to speak
to Mr. Moffitt.

677
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,057
Can you find him for me?

678
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,863
Thanks.

679
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,700
This is Life One out.

680
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:51,469
What can I do for you,
Michael?

681
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,844
How's the countdown going?

682
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:57,874
Funny you should ask.
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

683
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,387
Shoot.

684
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:06,553
I've decided to abort
the countdown.

685
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,590
What are you saying?

686
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,258
What do you mean abort?

687
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:18,069
I'm rebooting the mission.

688
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,607
I'm going to Europa.

689
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,836
Wait a minute.

690
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:25,709
I got a ton of reasons
why that's not gonna work.

691
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,681
Besides, everybody here is
working to get you down safely.

692
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,208

Just listen to me for a second.

693
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,885
There's a reason
I came up here.

694
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:43,530
Someone's supposed to go.

695
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:46,226
Someone's supposed to see this.

696
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:52,204
Michael, I have no button
to bring you down.

697
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,143
You got me.

698
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,213
You got me.
There's nothing I can do.

699
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:06,783
I thought my life was over
when that accident happened.

700
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,321
The truth is,
I've been living life up here.

701
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,722
I'm gonna continue to live.

702
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:24,734
Michael...
what was this all for?

703
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,569
See the whales on Europa?

704
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,838
Mr. Moffitt...

705
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,641
you got to learn
to trust me again.

706
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,841
Michael, listen to me.

707
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:38,317
I don't know how else to put
this, but we gotta lay
Nathan to rest.

708
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:39,944
We have to.

709
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,657
I just want you home.

710
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:52,926
You hear me? Michael?

711
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:59,106
I can't have another death
on my conscience.

712
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,373
Michael? Michael?

713
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,133
This is Michael Forrest
of Life One.

714
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:40,236
You'll have to forgive me.

715
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:44,182
I'm not normally a man
of many words...

716
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,482
but I'm doing the best I can.

717
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,551
I wanted to thank all of you...

718
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,184
for your support.

719
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,993
Thought I was alone up here.

720
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,693
I was wrong.

721
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:06,032
It was about three years ago...

722
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:09,838
from now that Astronaut
Nathan Miller lost his life.

723
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:19,218
I lost a colleague,
a fellow astronaut, friend.

724
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:24,224
But just like all of you,
his spirit never abandoned me.

725
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:31,191
In a book he brought onboard,
a collection of poems.

726
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,258
He speaks to me.

727
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:39,967
One passage in particular,
I still hear him loud and clear.

728
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:44,107
It's by T.S. Eliot.

729
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:50,118
It says, ""We shall not cease
from exploration.

730
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:56,815
""And the end of all our
exploring will be to arrive
where we started.

731
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,450
""And know the place
for the first time.

732
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,297
""Through the unknown,
unremembered gate...

733
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:08,927
""when the last of Earth left to
discover was that which was the
beginning.

734
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:17,176
""Quick now, here, now.
Always.

735
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:25,179
""A condition of complete
simplicity costing not less
than everything.

736
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,187
""And all shall be well.

737
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:35,251
""And all manner of things
shall be well.

738
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:39,528
""When the tongues of flame
are enfolded into the crowned
knot of fire.

739
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:48,708
""And the fire
and the rose are one.""

740
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:04,992
We're just getting started.

741
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:08,153
This is Life One... out.
