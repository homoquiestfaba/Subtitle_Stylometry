Wlth the passage of the

00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:32,245
a new and mlghty weapon In the war
on terror was placed In our hands.

00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:36,078
The flrst major step
mandated under the new law

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,711
was to unlte the vast array of separate
publlc and prlvate survelllance cameras

11
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,742

00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,543
Negative. Hold positions.

33
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:53,218
We got company.

34
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,514

193
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,721
Well, he's
a good man.

194
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:12,059
He'll get
my vote again.

195
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:17,569
Yeah. Yeah,

196

Hey, llsten, you thlnk we could
just not tell anybody about thls?

197
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,301
I got enough nut jobs

198
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,071
Yeah. Our job
is keeping you safe.

199
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,839
Keep the family
relations quiet.

200
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,505
Okay, thank you.

00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:29,912

204
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,720
Gunner.

205
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:47,930
Donut run.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,865
Gunner, Gunner.

207
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,198
Agent Reynolds.

208
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,067
Yeah. Ms. Hoppy,
isn't it?

209
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,572
Barbara Hawkins. What
happened here this evening?

210
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,540
Nothing. It's
all over.

211
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,099
We heard reports of gunshots
from this establishment.

212
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,201
Yeah, there
were gunshots.

213
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:00,609
And why was that?

214
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,614
Because guns
were being fired.

215
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,116
Was there a reason,
or are you and your men

216
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,948
just the sort to enjoy shootlng
off thelr loads whlle people watch?

217
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,116
Not if you're filming
it. Good night, Ms. Harpy.

218
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,419
Hawkins.

219
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:21,132
J ust in the
nick of too late.

220
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,432
You know, they have machines that'll
do your job now, minus the lip.

221
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,267
We're off.

222
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,275
To make the news.

223
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,707
You just
got careless.

224
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,068
I didn't do it.

225
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:10,513
Are you saying I can't trust
what I see with my own eyes?

226
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:16,021
You're not seeing it
with your own eyes.

227
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:20,422
You're seeing it
with thelr eyes.

228
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,892
All right. Let's talk
about last night.

229
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,196
The kid. You were
trying to kill him.

230
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,759
Why?

231
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,032
The kld Is
a stepplng stone.

232
00:16:34,106 --> 00:16:35,334
To the president?

233
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,841
He's not
the president.

234
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:39,036
He was never elected
into office.

235
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,976
Funny, I thought
we had an election.

236
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,514
Not an election,
a coup!

237
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,481
Computerized voting.
No paper trail.

238
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,643
The exit
polls showed him

239
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,687
tralllng the whole day,
and then some computer

240
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:50,051
announces he's
our new presldent?

241
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,682
Oh, this guy
looks like

242
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:56,694
the love child of Charles
Manson and Karl Marx. Ew.

243
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,662
He doesn't look like a Marx brother.

244
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,062
Oh, cute.

245
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,066
Their guy wins,
it's democracy.

246
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,227
Our guy wins,
it's a coup.

247
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,134
Actually, I voted
for the other guy.

248
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:07,229
Really?

249
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,398
U h-huh.

250
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,498
Me, too.

251
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,906
Oh.

252
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,568
You want
some coffee?

253
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:13,907
And the only way
we can take America back

254
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,539
is to kill
Benjamin Hewes.

255
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:19,243
President won't be in
town for another two weeks.

256
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,910
And you knew you dldn't have two weeks,

257
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,681
so you went
after the kid.

258
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:25,690
You're just putting nails
in freedom's coffin.

259
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:28,727
My job is to protect freedom
and the people of this nation

260
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:30,694
from those that would do them harm.

261
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:36,258
I n that case, we're on the same side.

262
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:41,637
What say we go after that
son of a bitch Hewes together?

263
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,276
You realize you're
facing federal charges.

264
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:51,282
U nder the Freedom
of Observatlon Act,

265
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,614
it is a government offense
to tamper with, disable,

266
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,711
or otherwise
interfere with

267
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,382
the operatlon of an
offlclal observatlon devlce,

268
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:00,357
which basically
means you're screwed,

269
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,793
'cause you're going to pay
for that Eyeborg you shot.

270
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:07,765
Now, take some time and
come up with some names

271
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,130
by the time
I get back.

272
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:10,930
How about Kyle?

273
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:15,303
And Sharon?

274
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:19,401
Damn shame what happened
to your family.

275
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,345
I am sorry about that.

276
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,581
I'm sure you are.

277
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,289
But if it wasn't for
what happened to them,

278
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:35,191
we wouldn't have Eyeborgs
to scrape out scum like you.

279
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,264
Don't let that freak get to you.

280
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:50,365
He's not.

281
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,614
Go figure.

282
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:57,742
Well, ain't you
a cute little thing.

283
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,175
Oh, there he Is.
Agent Reynolds.

284
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,346
Ms. Hawkins, what are you doing here?

285
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,616
I'm trying to get a straight answer
about what happened last night.

286
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,180
I have no comment.

287
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,282
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

288
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,725
Wait.

289
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:51,729
Decaf.

290
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,061
There was a shooting last
night at a public facility.

291
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,397
Turn that camera off. No,
don't turn the camera off.

292
00:20:56,468 --> 00:21:00,234
You have no right to film in this
building. I do, I am in the lobby.

293
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:01,898
Turn that camera off
or I'll shoot you.

294
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,566
- He can't shoot you.
- I will shoot you.

295
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,576
He is allowed
to be in the lobby.

296
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,306
Everybody wants to be a
comedian. What's that all about?

297
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,508
Hey, drink up. First they ban
cigarettes. This will be next.

298
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,924
H uh?

299
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,075
Obviously, you're
hiding something.

300
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:42,306
- I'm not hiding anything.
- No! Turn that back on!

301
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,349
Hey, hey.

302
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:48,477
Oh, God. No, no, no, no. U h-uh.

303
00:21:56,829 --> 00:22:00,321
Security breach. All sections initiate
lock-down procedures immediately.

304
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:01,661
I nltlate lockdown
procedures Immedlately.

305
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,031
J ust stay here!

306
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:05,036
Thls Is not a drlll.

307
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:10,897
Oh!

308
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,111
Ashley, talk
to me.

309
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:22,653
The subject is headed
toward the south hall.

310
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,552
Damn.

311
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:25,817
Toward the west lobby.

312
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,017
East stairwell, now.

313
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,059
East stairwell.

314
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:32,694
Yeah, he's in
the west lobby.

315
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,905
There he is.
U p there.

316
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:46,843
Now in the
north stairwell.

317
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:50,348
Come on,

Got you.

319
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:57,147
Ah!

320
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,227
I need you to override the
emergency lock-down on level six.

321
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:17,139
Overriding the lock-down
on level six.

322
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:20,144
Come on.

323
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:22,577
Come on.

324
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,975
Agent Warner,

325
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,045
Hang on.

326
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,218
Let's go.

00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,125
Override lock-down,

328
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,791
Abort lock-down.
Come on.

329
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,325
No! No!

330
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,662
D H S agents are uncertaln

Absolutely horrlble.
Thank you, Barbara.

337
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,574
I n other news,
Presldent Benjamln Hewes...

338
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:43,087
My uncle's politics take a turn
to fucking derangement land,

339
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:45,089
and people want
to take it out on me.

340
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:47,887
I mean, I haven't even seen
him since I was a little kid.

341
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:55,599
I don't even know him anymore, you know?

342
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,602
I wouldn't vote for the son
of a bitch, and we're related.

343
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,433
Jarett, at least
you're still alive.

344
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:02,234
I mean, God knows I never
thought I'd say this.

345
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,605
As much as those Eyeborg
things creep me out,

346
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:09,704
you would be dead
if it weren't for them.

347
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:13,012
Tsk.
M m.

348
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:16,612
Look, I am sure the
guitar man can fix her up.

349
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:20,055
Yeah, well, if G
- Man can't, no one can.

350
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,252
I could use
a little fixing, too.

351
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:23,294
H m!
Yeah?

352
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:28,123
Oh, look.

353
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,430
It's your uncle.

354
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:33,300
As presldent, there Is
nothlng more Important

355
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,273
than protectlng the people.

356
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:40,141
Great. Now he's cutting
into my sex life, too.

357
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:42,442
That Is why I supported the
Freedom of Observatlon Act.

358
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,482
Now, wlth my new law,

359
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:46,210
every camera
In the natlon,

360
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,310
as well as mllllons
of moblle unlts,

361
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:51,288
have been llnked
dlrectly Into O D I N.

362
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:55,986
Man, millions
of mobile units.

363
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,155
...a network that never
sleeps, never rests,

364
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:01,791
and never stops
looklng out for you.

365
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,301
Yesterday, the
State Department

366
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,167
Issued yet another
terror alert,

367
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:09,833
thls tlme cltlng the
natlon of Zlmbeklstan.

368
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,138
What? Zimbekistan?

369
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,940
Are they your next
target, M r. Presldent?

370
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:19,177
How many more natlons wlll we Invade

371
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:22,186
before you're
satlsfled we're safe?

372
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:24,779
The flnal debate
wlll be held next week,

373
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,188
wlth our own Wlnston Salem playlng host

374
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:30,786
to the presldent's
contlngent. Jamle Kell reports.

375
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,854
Jlll, I'm standlng outslde
the Mlllennlum Center,

376
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:36,958
from whlch the presldent's slde
of the debate wlll be broadcast.

377
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,696
I'm gonna
be there.

378
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,499
I cannot belleve
you convlnced me

379
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,039
to play
thls fundralser.

380
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:43,597
Oh, stop whining.

381
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:45,438
He is desperate
for the younger vote,

382
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,341
and you
need the gig.

383
00:27:47,412 --> 00:27:48,709
J ust take advantage of it
and invite some fans along.

384
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,304
Yeah, right.

385
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:52,373
He won't even let me bring the band.

386
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:56,353
He only speaks In front of
Invlted, supportlng crowds,

387
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:58,116
for security reasons.

388
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,953
As wlth
prevlous debates,

389
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,118
the candldates are In
dlfferent locatlons

390
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:03,559
to create a less centrallzed
target for terrorlsts.

391
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:05,493
What are you doing?

392
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,896
Do you remember that wedding
gig you did last month?

393
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:10,059
The two ladies
who got married.

394
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,399
No, the other one.

395
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,371
Oh, the forelgn guy?

396
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,066
There has deflnltely
been a bank error.

397
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:18,302
Come and
check it out.

398
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:21,369
Only Indlvlduals especlally
Invlted by the presldent

399
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,539
are permltted Inslde
the debate hall.

400
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:25,879
Obvlously he
llked us.

401
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:28,579
Obviously a computer hair-balled up
a decimal point in the wrong place.

402
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,985
I mean, I'll have
the bank fix it,

403
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:34,583
but do you remember that terror
alert on the news, about Zimbekistan?

404
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,388
Yeah?

405
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,759
Well, that's where all
this money came from.

406
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,854
What?

407
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:40,989
Yeah.

408
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,034
Oh, shit!

409
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,160
Ronni, the last thing I need
is for the government to think

410
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:47,899
that I'm in some kind of
business with terrorists.

411
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:51,170
I mean, If U ncle B's opponents get ahold
of that, thls could be really serlous.

412
00:28:51,243 --> 00:28:53,768
I know, I know, I will
have it fixed by tomorrow.

413
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:56,405
Look, who
never fails you?

414
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,914
My Ronni.

415
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:59,951
That's right.
Don't ever forget it.

416
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,418
I'm glad you
failed once.

417
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:11,757
Yeah, me too.

418
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,162
Or I'd have
never met you.

419
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:21,600
You know the most romantlc
thlng you ever sald to me?

420
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:26,804
U m, put on this collar
and bark like a dog?

421
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:29,711
No, but that was dope.

422
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:32,215
The flrst
tlme we talked-

423
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:34,980
M m-hm?

424
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:37,146
Jarett, just shut up
and fuck me already.

425
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:40,988
U h, yeah, that was it.

426
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:09,248
No, no, play it again.

427
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:17,292
That's not what happened.
I locked that door.

428
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:19,523
I keyed in
the codes.

429
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:20,792
I got the
red light.

430
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,424
Not according
to O D I N.

431
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,298
Database confirms
what the cameras show.

432
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,304
You keyed the
unlock code twice.

433
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,306
Then the
database is wrong.

434
00:30:29,374 --> 00:30:30,932
Are you postal?

435
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,499
There's nothing wrong
with the database.

436
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:34,511
You keyed the
wrong codes.

437
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:37,047
Video shows it, and
computer records confirm it.

438
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,310
It's wrong.
I locked that door.

439
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:42,080
What are you saying? I can't trust
what I can see with my own eyes?

440
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,714
J im, you were there. What happened?

441
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:49,191
I'm sorry,
I didn't see it.

442
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:50,558
What do you mean,
you didn't see?

443
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:51,653
You were standing
next to me.

444
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,357
You were upset.

445
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,524
You've keyed those
codes a thousand times.

446
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,534
This time, you
made a mistake.

447
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,900
And that's how I'm
writing it up, all right?

448
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,404
E. O. F.

449
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:11,047
Play it again.

450
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,846
George! George, you can't do
an end of file on this one.

451
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,682
Because?

452
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:18,052
Because Sankur was trying
to kill the president.

453
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:19,556
What if he wasn't
working alone?

454
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:20,921
No one was
working with Sankur.

455
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,550
How do we know that?

456
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,822
Because the head
office said so.

457
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,558
They've had this fruit
basket flagged and monitored

458
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:31,932
ever since he checked out The Anarchist's
Cookbook from the local library.

459
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:35,564
He was a lone nut.
Now he's a dead nut.

460
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,234
Well, at least let Bradley
and I check out his apartment.

461
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,368
Jesus, Gunner!

462
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:40,433
We might find-

463
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:42,571
Don't you get it?

464
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:44,945
You've got good friends in high places,

465
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,541
probably because your testimony
helped get the Eyeborg system on-line.

466
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,917
Aw, come on! Don't
pull that on me, George!

467
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,956
But push
this too far-

468
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:56,050
and someone may press
charges for negligence.

469
00:31:56,127 --> 00:32:00,962
Don't let one mistake
ruin a great career.

470
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:03,398
I'm not ordering you
as a supervisor.

471
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:05,959
I'm telling
you as a friend.

472
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,265
Let it go!

473
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,622
What kind of a tenant was Sankur?

474
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:34,631
He was very,
very quiet,

475
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:38,294
and he was
very strange.

476
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,769
They always are.

477
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,965
Oh, am I gonna
be on television?

478
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,268
Maybe.

479
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,501
Oh.
Oh.

480
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:49,012
These doors
kind of stick.

481
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,479
Oh, there we go.

482
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,948
Thank you. We won't be long.

483
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:54,645
Oh, take your time.

484
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,482
You know, I'm a fan of yours.

485
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:57,578
Oh, thank you.

486
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:58,782
Bye.

487
00:32:58,857 --> 00:32:59,983
Thank you.
Bye bye.

488
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,771
Whoa.

489
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:20,310
Suddenly the clutter In my
apartment doesn't seem that bad.

490
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,370
Gunner said they were done here, but it
doesn't look like anybody's been in here!

491
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:27,407
There's got to be
something really good here.

492
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,894
Ho, ho, ho.
Here's something good.

493
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:45,060
M r. Deller's, it's
been such a long time.

494
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,229
How are you doing?

495
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,863
Eric, don't even
look at this.

496
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,498
I've got it
under control.

497
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:52,475
It's like running
into your ex-wife.

498
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:55,069
Glad to be rid of her, but
there were some good times.

499
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:58,081
Come on, Eric, give it
- You take this and I'll take this.

500
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,379
Pry it loose. Pry it
loose. Pry it loose.

501
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:04,883
Okay.

502
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:11,085
Oh!

503
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,255
Look at this, look
at this, look at this.

504
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:14,355
What?
What?

505
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:16,559
This is the kid,

506
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,864
the punk rocker that Sankur
attacked the other nlght.

507
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,996
He's related
to the presldent.

508
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:24,098
He's related to the president.
That's what Gunner was hiding!

509
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:27,542
Yeah, probably worried
you'd report it.

510
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,273
And risk losing
my reporter's license?

511
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,939
I don't thlnk so.

512
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,744
Do you think he's hiding something else?

513
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:34,717
Yeah, he did seem
a little tense.

514
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:37,550
A llttle tense? He
threatened to shoot me.

515
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:42,889
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sankur
claimed this D H S footage wasn't real.

516
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:45,555
Is it possible that this is fake?

517
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,120
Sure. I mean,
computers these days-

518
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:49,462
Anybody can make
a computer composite.

519
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:52,628
But to make It reallstlc-looklng
and rendered In real tlme?

520
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:56,299
Now you're talklng some
serlous processlng power.

521
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,775
Would you check it out for me, please?

522
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,210
Worth a bottle
of Deller's?

523
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,872
No, it's not.

524
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,438
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

525
00:35:05,517 --> 00:35:07,144
Of course I'll do it
for you, Barbara.

00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:08,651
Come on I
We're offl

527
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,119

528
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:15,152
# I can't belleve It #

529
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,161
# The way you

# Llke a trampled flag
On a clty street #

531
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:25,160
# Oh, yeah #

532
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:29,172
# 'Cause I'm a 21 st
Century dlgltal boy #

533
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,176
# I don't know how to llve,
But I got a lot of toys #

534
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:37,010
# My daddy's a lazy
Mlddle-class Intellectual #

535
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,948
# My mommy's on Vallum
So Ineffectual #

536
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:45,620
# 21 st century boy #

537
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,090
# Scream for more #

538
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,822
# Aln't llfe
A mystery, yeah ##

539
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,369
Hello, G-Man? G-Man?

540
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,374
You're supposed to stay open
tlll 5.:00. Where are you?

541
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:06,535
G- Man?

542
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:09,671
El hombre de guitar.

543
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,841
Wlnd blows
open my door,

544
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:15,010
and who floats in
on the breeze?

545
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:18,214
None other than the nephew
of the almlghty hlmself.

546
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,814
Come on,
G, not again.

547
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:23,224
Stlll a llttle touchy about belng
related to the bastard-In-chlef, huh?

548
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:26,855
You really wanna talk politics to
a guy with purple hair? Seriously?

549
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:27,955
How's It hanglng, J?

550
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,057
It's good. You?

551
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:35,401
Eh, long and llmp, but
at least I can walk on It.

552
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,498
Now what graces you
to my doorstep?

553
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,736
Check it out.

554
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:49,683
Let me guess
- Brandon bounclng around on stage agaln?

555
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,984
U h, no. Brandon's,
llke, mlsslng.

556
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:55,315
What?

557
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:57,258
He disappeared with some chick
after the H igh Point show.

558
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:59,694
Well, if not
him, then who?

559
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,261
A freaking
Lie-borg did this?

560
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,394
Hey, It saved
my llfe, man.

561
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:09,031
Really, I'm serious. I
know you don't like them.

562
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:11,701
Don't like them? That's
an understatement.

563
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,939
Look, I can count seven or elght of
them damn thlngs, rlght from here,

564
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,278
and every one of them
photon-sucklng spy-bots-

565
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:22,080
Wired directly to
your uncle's office.

566
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,281
Yeah, I'm actually pretty
sure the O D I N mainframe

567
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:28,291
is not sitting
in the Oval Office.

568
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,293
M ight as well be.

569
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:33,626
We, the people, sure don't
run this country anymore.

570
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:37,725
Looks llke my uncle wants me to
play thls fundralser next week.

571
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:40,566
Never figured the
C- in-C for a headbanger.

572
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:41,935
Thlnk you can
get her done?

573
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,871
Patience, kid, patience.

574
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:47,434
I love the extremeness
of your life, man.

575
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:49,377
As long as those Eyeborgs are around.

576
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:50,914
Dude, they're
just cameras.

577
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,950
An E B saved your
life, didn't it?

578
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,882
Yes. By taklng a pretty plcture of you?

579
00:37:54,953 --> 00:37:56,818
No. By gettlng between me and a bullet.

580
00:37:56,888 --> 00:38:01,052
Wow. Pretty smart move for
a camera, don't you think?

581
00:38:02,894 --> 00:38:03,883
Ah.

582
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,463
Here. Read thls.

583
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,994
"The Freedom
of Observatlon Act?"

584
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,337
Are you kidding me? Did
you actually read all this?

585
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:20,172
More than the stupid senators
and congressmen that passed it.

586
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:23,611
Check out page 742.

587
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:29,347
" I n the absence of any formal
law enforcement authority,

588
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,686
"a unit may act as needed
to obstruct a perpetrator

589
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:37,023
In the commlsslon
of a crlme. "

590
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,826
So yeah, If a terrorlst Is
about to blow up a bulldlng,

591
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:43,526
and there's no cops around to stop It,

592
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,535
then an Eyeborg
can stop it.

593
00:38:45,603 --> 00:38:46,831
Exactly.

594
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:47,996
What is wrong
with that?

595
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,004
What's wrong with it?

596
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:51,041
Yeah.

597
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:53,339
It's not limited to just
terrorists blowing up buildings.

598
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:54,776
What If an Eyeborg catches
you dolng somethlng wrong,

599
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:56,211
and no one's around
to stop it?

600
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,544
It can do
whatever it wants.

601
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,982
They're just
security cameras.

602
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:02,542
What if it's
not just a camera?

603
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,383
What if somebody
puts a weapon in it?

604
00:39:04,455 --> 00:39:06,218
Think about it.

605
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,850
Robot soldlers
Inflltratlng soclety,

606
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,554
seeklng out enemles
of the government.

607
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:13,529
This is America.

608
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,828
Thlngs llke that
can't just happen.

609
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:26,034
Man, you really had me golng there
wlth all that consplracy crap.

610
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,738
It's not crap.
I was there

611
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:32,340
when they first used robot
soldiers to kill people in GW2.

612
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,577
I'm telling you-

613
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,551
Eyeborgs keep
us safe.

614
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,248
"Those who choose safety over
freedom deserve neither. "

615
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:42,258
Benny Franklin, 1776.

616
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:47,093
Those who would play for the
president need a working guitar.

617
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,430
Jarett, 5: 27.

618
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,095
I'll get her all pretty
for you. Don't worry.

619
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,537
All right.
Hey, thanks, bro.

620
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:57,096
See you.

621
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:54,154
Oh, God, look out.
My God, he's got a gun.

622
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:48,709
Ha. What
do you know?

623
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:50,945
M m.

624
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:56,887
Eric, hey,
what's up?

625
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,792
I did what
you asked.

626
00:41:58,863 --> 00:41:59,989
I went over Sankur's
homicide video,

627
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:00,894
and guess what I found?

628
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:02,023
What?

629
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,191
Plxel blendlng.

630
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,167
What does that mean?

631
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,295
If you create a 3-D
object In a computer,

632
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:09,669
you can render It wlth 2-D,
but If the angle's too steep,

633
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,731
you get artifacts.

634
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:13,470
The only way to get
somethlng llke that perfect

635
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:15,671
Is to have a 3-D scan
of the person.

636
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:17,407
Wlthout that, there's always
some flaw to glve It away.

637
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:19,676
I n Sankur's clothing,
there's an area

638
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,241
where It looks llke- You
guessed It- Plxel blendlng.

639
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,582
So does that mean the
video could be fake?

640
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:25,918
That's what I just sald.

641
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,584
Oh, I knew somethlng was up.
Beam It over to me rlght now.

642
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,354
U m, this system's
not networked.

643
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,589
What, are you In the Stone Age?

644
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:35,427
It keeps from gettlng vlruses,
all rlght? Hold on. Okay.

645
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:39,094
Look, I got the chip in hand. I'll come
over and show you what I'm talking about.

646
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,606
That's even better. I'm gonna be
home in ten minutes. Go right now. Go.

647
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:39,723
What is this?

648
00:43:39,797 --> 00:43:42,288
Barbara, I was
just kidding.

649
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,993
Jeez, you want
to get me fired?

650
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,265
Get off of me!

651
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:52,172
Let me go!

652
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:55,805
Let go of me.

653
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,620
What are
you dolng?

654
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:04,848
What are
you doing?

655
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,689
Ahh!

656
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,928
Ahhh!

657
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,453
Yeah, whoo!

658
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:48,789
Now that's how you
make the news, baby.

659
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:50,850
Thank you.

660
00:45:56,867 --> 00:46:00,325
You have
been "dis-armed", baby.

661
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:40,269
Damn.

662
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:41,504
Hell's a'popping.

663
00:46:48,919 --> 00:46:52,150
See what you can find out.

664
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,856
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

665
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,798
No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

666
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,234
I'm okay.

667
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:16,344
We D Led Eric
leaving the station.

668
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,686
And these are from
the trafflc camera.

669
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:29,517
Eyewltness sald he nearly kllled
her when he ran a red llght.

670
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,153
He was all over the road,
completely out of control.

671
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:34,720
Were you aware that Eric had
a history of alcohol abuse?

672
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:38,199
Yes, but he was always so definite
that his drinking was in the past.

673
00:47:45,976 --> 00:47:50,072
Why did you call us?
This was a traffic accident.

674
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:51,739
What made you thlnk
It was a D H S matter?

675
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,749
This is going to sound
a little crazy now,

676
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:55,546
but I had Erlc analyze
the Sankur homlclde vldeo.

677
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,917
Why?

678
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:00,752
Sankur sald the vldeo wasn't real,

679
00:48:00,824 --> 00:48:03,759
and Eric's a video expert,
so I had him analy ze it.

680
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,021
He said it looked fake.

681
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:06,562
He was coming to show me.

682
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,257
Report from
the forenslc guy.

683
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,561
Sounds a lot less plausible
coming from a drunk.

684
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:15,571
But he didn't sound drunk.

685
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:17,607
Computer analysis.

686
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:20,269
Shows he had almost
a full bottle today.

687
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:22,141
I'm sorry.

688
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:27,175
But he
didn't sound drunk.

689
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:06,179
Coffee?

690
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:10,084
So how'd you
find me here?

691
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,025
My little
friend showed me.

692
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:19,635
Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting you
are the father of the Eyeborgs.

693
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:21,830
That's not
my favorite title.

694
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:24,237
It's just that everybody knows
that if it weren't for you,

695
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:26,833
the O D I N system would never
have gone beyond the testlng stage.

696
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,141
That's because I testified in
front of the senate committee,

697
00:49:30,214 --> 00:49:32,478
and you reported
how I felt.

698
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:39,019
Look, Gunner, I had a story to do,

699
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:41,455
and it was about
how you felt.

700
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:45,017
You weren't just another law
enforcement officer bucking for a tool.

701
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:48,030
Your story- What
happened to your family-

702
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:52,034
That is what
moved people.

703
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:56,038
I just wanted to catch the bastard
that killed my wife and took my son.

704
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:59,667
I know. And you got
the Eyeborgs instead.

705
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:03,144
Yeah, and a very nice note
from the vice president,

706
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:06,046
thanklng me for my
support on hls pet project.

707
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:10,485
Look, how close were you with Eric?

708
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,387
He was like a little brother.
He was a pest sometimes,

709
00:50:13,457 --> 00:50:15,721
but I don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

710
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,489
If he was drinking again, do you
think he would have hidden it from you?

711
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:23,056
Like you hiding that the kid who was attacked
the other night was the president's nephew?

712
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:26,694
You are on a need to know basis.

713
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,238
I couldn't have
his identity compromised

714
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:33,675
by puttlng hls
name on the alr.

715
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:37,077
Do you know
what this is?

716
00:50:37,147 --> 00:50:39,240
A journalist's license.

717
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,216
When the government
started requiring

718
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:43,879
that journalists be licensed,
most of my colleagues quit,

719
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:47,014
but I stayed.
Do you know why?

720
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:49,924
Because my husband was
killed in the last attacks,

721
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,188
and I swore I'd do
whatever I could

722
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:57,063
to prevent anyone from havlng
to feel that klnd of paln.

723
00:50:57,134 --> 00:50:59,261
Other reporters
called me a traltor,

724
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,099
but I believe
in what I did,

725
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:04,163
so don't treat me like
I can't be trusted.

726
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:17,549
Are you certain that Eric
was right about the video?

727
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:20,385
Absolutely. I
am posltlve.

728
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:25,087
Because if you report
what I'm about to tell you,

729
00:51:25,162 --> 00:51:27,562
we could both be brought
up on Patriot Act charges.

730
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:30,122
Well then, I guess it's all
about trust, then, isn't it?

731
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,792
I must be
loslng my mlnd.

732
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,030
Flne. There
are thlngs-

733
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,197
Small thlngs,
but a lot of them.

734
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:51,146
...Vetoed pendlng leglslatlon,

735
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:53,553

736

saylng wlth the ever-changlng
nature of the terrorlst threat,

737
00:51:56,226 --> 00:51:59,161
It Is vltal to keep

00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:08,796
Bastard.

742
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,396
These robot soldlers,

743
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:12,408

744
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:14,808

746
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:18,777
Why dld the presldent
veto a blll

747
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,817
deslgned to prohlblt
domestlc deployment?

748
00:52:20,884 --> 00:52:23,182

every optlon avallable

751
00:52:34,264 --> 00:52:35,595
Go.

752
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:36,792
You got to
stop the project.

753
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:38,198
Is your line encrypted?

754
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:39,496
It doesn't matter.
They know.

755
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,470
Where are you?

756
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:43,836
Look, I don't think
I have much time.

757
00:52:43,907 --> 00:52:46,307
You-you got to
cancel the project.

758
00:52:46,376 --> 00:52:48,003
Davld, calm down.

759
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:49,375
It's rlgged

Well, unrig it.
U nrig it now!

761

762
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,147
The president.

763
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:54,707
The Eyeborgs.
I know the truth.

764
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:55,843
What truth?

765
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:06,557
God help us all.

766
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:13,459
They're here.

767
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:14,936
Nol

768
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,244
Robot rats.

769
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:50,099
Come on, try to get a plece
of me, you slllcon psychosl

770
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,607
You little
binary bastards.

771
00:53:57,848 --> 00:54:00,373
Llttle dlgltal dlngoes.

772
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,849
Ahh I

773
00:54:03,353 --> 00:54:05,947
Ahh!

774
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:40,650
Hey, G-Man.

775
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,768
Hey, G,
You in there, man?

776
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:53,996
Hey, G, it's Jarett.

777
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,334
Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,174
Help, help, help.

779
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,476
Help. Hey, hey, hey.

780
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,347
Help, help. Help. Help.

781
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:10,716
Help. Hey. Whoa.

782
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:33,637
G- Man! G-Man!
Oh, God.

783
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,803
G- Man. I
need an ambulance.

784
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:39,371
I'm in Liberty and Trade
Street behind M idtown Guitar.

785
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,280
Don't tell me
to calm down I

786
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:49,616
Want to go
over the part agaln

787
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,957
about what you
saw In the alley?

788
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:54,293
I saw an Eyeborg rushlng
out, and It attacked me.

789
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,162
Eyeborgs aren't allowed on
private property without a warrant.

790
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:59,202
I know that.

791
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,294
There's no warrant
Issued for thls property,

792
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:02,804
so there's no way there
was an Eyeborg Inslde.

793
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:04,238
Video surveillance
in the alley.

794
00:56:06,476 --> 00:56:09,411
No, no,
that's not rlght.

795
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:12,346
No, It wasn't a man.
It was an Eyeborg.

796
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,247
It was one of those, it was
one of the big spidery ones.

797
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:15,909
Yeah, but
I see a man.

798
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:18,580
But you're not seeing
through your eyes.

799
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:20,247
You're seelng
wlth thelr eyes.

800
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,121
I saw what I saw.

801
00:56:33,503 --> 00:56:36,597
What are you dolng?
Are you golng nuts?

802
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:40,268
I'd like to know if my partner's going
nuts before you get us both killed.

803
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:41,537
I don't know, J im.

804
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:44,079
J ust cut me
some slack.

805
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,739
I'm working
on something.

806
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,748
Is that the guitar
G- Man repaired?

807
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:55,621
Yeah. G-Man
was the best.

808
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,094
Can I take her?

809
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:04,099
Sure. It's
not evldence.

810
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,465
Try to stay
out of trouble.

811
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:09,164
I just want to go home
and be wlth my glrl.

812
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,551
Guilty conscience
there, partner?

813
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:23,269
Is thls a joke?

814
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:27,882
Come on.

815
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:30,044
Come on, son. I'll
buy you some ice cream.

816
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:40,719
My momma warned me
about guys like you.

817
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:49,170
Thank you,
I ris. Ahhh.

818
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,230
Isn't thls fabulous?

819
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,743
Sure you don't want some?

820
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:56,039
It's freedom vanilla.

821
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,340
What's the
deal, man?

822
00:58:57,414 --> 00:58:59,006
Am I under arrest here?

823
00:58:59,082 --> 00:59:00,743
I mean, every time
something bad happens-

824
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,910
I thought this would be
a safe place to talk.

825
00:59:02,986 --> 00:59:04,851
And now
G- man is dead.

826
00:59:04,921 --> 00:59:06,718
I thought thls would
relax you a llttle blt,

827
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,587
because you seem to be
very tense most of the time.

828
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:10,216
Now, of course, I'm eating
freedom vanilla ice cream

829
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:12,022
in an exotic car wash
with a D H S officer.

830
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:14,757
I believe you saw an
Eyeborg the other night.

831
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:16,992
Thank you.

832
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:18,728
I can't be certain, but I think
someone hacked into the O D I N system

833
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:20,463
and Is controlllng them.

834
00:59:22,138 --> 00:59:23,162
Focus!

835
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,764
What?

836
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:26,934
Yeah, no, I know.
I thought there were-

837
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,104
I think someone's trying
to kill the president.

838
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,408
H uh? Are you
kidding me?

839
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:33,039
No, I'm not.

840
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:35,607
Someone-

841
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:38,449
Someone has compromised
our surveillance system.

842
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:39,579
Like who?

843
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,055
Like terrorists.

844
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:43,388
Ooh, terrorists.
I'm so scared.

845
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,894
The government made the Eyeborgs,
they control the Eyeborgs,

846
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:48,362
but if something goes wrong,
it's never the government's fault.

847
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:51,229
There's a traitor somewhere, somewhere
probably high up in government office.

848
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:53,235
Maybe even Inslde
the D H S.

849
00:59:53,303 --> 00:59:55,100
What do you want me
to do about it?

850
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:57,162
I need you to contact the presldent.

851
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:00,804
You have found the wrong guy for that.

852
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:01,969
We're talking about
his life here.

853
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:04,275
I can't do that.

854
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,814
Why not? You're the only one
that can go dlrectly to hlm.

855
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:08,112
- They won't believe me.
- Why not?

856
01:00:08,184 --> 01:00:10,618
They won't believe me. Look,
there is an entire branch

857
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:12,746
of government that's set up to
protect him. You don't need me.

858
01:00:12,822 --> 01:00:14,790
Listen, son.

859
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:17,292
Whether you want to be involved
in this or not, you are.

860
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,160
Now, you, the president, and anyone
connected to you could be in serious danger.

861
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:25,099
We don't know anyone
In Zlmbeklstan.

862
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:27,432
So what you're telling me

863
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:30,302
Is that thls money came from
the government of Zlmbeklstan,

864
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:32,841

Ronni.

902
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,307
They're calllng
It a sulclde

903
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:40,611
because she had a
history, but I told them

904
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:43,982
what I thought I saw on the phone-
An Eyeborg- When she called me.

905
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,419
And what did the police
say when you said that?

906
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:48,548
There was no record
that she called.

907
01:05:52,695 --> 01:05:54,629
Dld you speak
to your uncle?

908
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:56,824
No, I trled. I can't get ahold of hlm.

909
01:05:56,899 --> 01:05:58,992
He's coming here tomorrow. I
need you to make that meeting.

910
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,935
No, no. I
can't. I can't.

911
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,597
I can't do that.

912
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:05,163
Jarett, I know this is
really hard on you,

913
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:06,572
but think about
what happened to Ronni,

914
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:08,133
what almost
happened to you.

915
01:06:08,211 --> 01:06:10,475
Your uncle could be
in extreme danger.

916
01:06:10,546 --> 01:06:11,979
Well, that's not my problem. That's not.

917
01:06:12,048 --> 01:06:13,982
No. That's not my
fucking problem.

918
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,450
You have no idea what you're
asking me to do here, okay?

919
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:19,113
I never, I never
talk to my family.

920
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:22,521
I mean, I am so far over on
the other fucking side of this-

921
01:06:23,826 --> 01:06:24,952
And there's
no way-

922
01:06:25,028 --> 01:06:27,121
I'm not.
No. I'm-

923
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,254
Jarett Hewes?

924
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:30,128

928
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:40,709
U ncle Benjamin.

929
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:44,036
I heard about

930
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:46,047
and I am so sorry.

931
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:47,878
Is there anythlng
I can do to help?

932
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,043
No, thank you.

933
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:54,055
U m, it's just...

934
01:06:54,123 --> 01:06:58,253
I
- I need to tell you something. I need to talk to you about the Eyeborgs.

935
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:01,162

01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,721
Wlll you excuse

937
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,066
Now, Jarett, llsten

938
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:12,073
Thls Is not a secure llne, and I'm
not In a posltlon to talk rlght now.

939
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:17,511
But It Is very Important that you
not mentlon thls to anyone else.

940
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:20,515
J ust promlse me you'll
be there tomorrow nlght,

941
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,710
and we can sort thls out face to face.

942
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:24,844
I really don't know
if I can be there.

943
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,752
Jarett, please.

944
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:29,792
At least let me see you

945
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:36,532
Okay.

01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,089

Okay, bye.

949
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:50,735
He sounded concerned.

950
01:07:50,813 --> 01:07:53,509
It doesn't seem like you're
on the other side, does it?

951
01:07:55,184 --> 01:07:58,779
Okay. Okay. I will play that fundraiser.

952
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:01,119
It's what Ronnl
wanted me to do.

953
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:04,785
But if I'm going to walk in there
and try to convince the president

954
01:08:04,861 --> 01:08:07,227
that security cameras
are killing people,

955
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,957
I need some
real proof.

956
01:08:13,202 --> 01:08:15,568
I'll get you
the proof.

957
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:16,696
You just be there.

958
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,342
Okay.

959
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:23,972
Okay.

960
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:25,206

01:09:14,397 --> 01:09:16,126
Thank you, Jlll.

974
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,326
The day of the debate
has flnally arrlved

975
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:20,369
In Wlnston-Salem at the
beautlful Mlllennlum Center.

976
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:22,427
The presldent's llmo
arrlved moments ago,

977
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:25,201
and we've been Informed
that he was escorted Inslde,

978
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:27,208
where a crowd
of Invlted supporters

979
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:29,938
awalts hlm
behlnd closed doors.

980
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:37,211
Oh.

981
01:09:37,286 --> 01:09:38,776
This is a great
idea you had,

982
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,652
checking out what's
his face's shop.

983
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:43,214
G- Man.

984
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:44,850
I know what happened
here. I saw the movie.

985
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:46,394
Well, now you can
read the book.

986
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:48,225
Ha ha ha.
That's funny.

987
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:53,667
Take a look at that.

988
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:55,294
What do you suppose
made this?

989
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:58,863
Look, I know what I saw in the video.

990
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:02,399
Well, let's take
a look inside.

991
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:04,878
Although only supporters
are allowed near the presldent

992
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,539
for securlty reasons,

993
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:08,481
there are, In fact,
many protesters

994
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:10,883
demonstratlng agalnst
hls pollcles here today.

995
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:14,218
For safety, such dlssenters are
kept far away from the presldent

996
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:15,848
In tlghtly regulated
flrst amendment zones.

997
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:18,223
Thank you, Barbara.

998
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:19,886
You ever thlnk about
how easy the Eyeborgs make It

999
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:22,328
to get convictions?

1000
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:24,889
If you mean having video of a crime
as compelling evidence, then yeah.

1001
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,434
It's hard to
argue with video.

1002
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,437
Exactly. No
cross examination.

1003
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:31,905
Was there anything
on the computers?

1004
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:35,273
Nothing. Our guys went over
it from the last bit and pixel.

1005
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:36,902
Someone that doesn't
trust machines

1006
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,571
wouldn't put anything
in there.

1007
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,507
He'd be doing things
the old-fashioned way.

1008
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,417
You heard It here-

1009
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,354
The presldent says
he understands and agrees

1010
01:10:48,424 --> 01:10:52,292
that we are way In
over our heads flnanclally,

1011
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:55,922
yet he contlnues to perpetuate
the problem by contlnulng

1012
01:10:55,998 --> 01:11:01,300
to put more money Into a
system whlch Is controlllng us,

1013
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,171
and my goal
Is to cut that out.

1014
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:19,946
What are
you dolng?

1015
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:21,956
It's hollow.

1016
01:11:22,024 --> 01:11:24,083
What?

1017
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,787
There Is one word

1018
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,658
that the senator llkes
to use a lot

1019
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:30,062
wlth reference to O D I N,
and that's control.

1020
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:33,465
There's a very blg dlfference
between observatlon and control.

1021
01:11:33,536 --> 01:11:36,699
Here. That's
it. Come here.

1022
01:11:48,484 --> 01:11:50,918
...the O D I N system.

1023
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:52,978
And from conceptlon
Into development,

1024
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:56,650
Into manufacturlng,
Into Implementatlon,

1025
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,421
many, many jobs
have been created.

1026
01:11:58,494 --> 01:12:00,985
Good afternoon, M r. Hewes.
Take that, please?

1027
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:05,295
I thlnk to the tune of over slx
mllllon jobs have been created,

1028
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:09,998
and ladles and gentlemen, every one of
those jobs Is wlthln the U nlted States.

1029
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:13,473
We have greatly Increased
the gross natlonal product,

1030
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:16,010
and Increased the tax base and the
revenues of the federal government.

1031
01:12:16,078 --> 01:12:19,377
It pays for Itself,
ladles and gentlemen.

1032
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:23,815
D H S to Secret Service,
Headliner has entered the building.

1033
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,683
What's this?

1034
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:32,386
Look at these deslgns.

1035
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:33,621
Weapons on the Eyeborgs?

1036
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:37,188
They must be fake.

1037
01:12:37,266 --> 01:12:40,030
She's not lax at all,
and we both know that.

1038
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:42,400
We just dlsagree.
We slmply dlsagree.

1039
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:44,564
Hello?

1040
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,040
We all know how I feel about It,

1041
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:50,169
and I'm hoplng one day, she'll
reveal how she feels about It,

1042
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:51,907
and what she wants
to do Instead.

1043
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:58,586
I want to make one
thlng perfectly clear,

1044
01:12:58,654 --> 01:13:02,055
and that Is I agree wlth the presldent.

1045
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:05,059
I belleve that we should be protected.

1046
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:08,563
I belleve that we do need securlty.

1047
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,599
However, there Is
a very thln llne

1048
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:15,603
between belng protected
and an Invaslon of prlvacy.

1049
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:22,602
God.

1050
01:13:22,678 --> 01:13:24,236
What's this?

1051
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:25,678
Looks like C-4.

1052
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:27,340
It's more like
a C-4 variant.

1053
01:13:29,118 --> 01:13:31,450
It's odorless
and malleable.

1054
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,455
This could get past the
scanners without a problem.

1055
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,616
There's no scent. The
snlffers would mlss It.

1056
01:13:36,692 --> 01:13:39,684
G- Man had to get it
near the president. How?

1057
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:52,467
We are not watchlng
the Amerlcan people.

1058
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:55,635
These are cameras and moblle
unlts. They are not human.

1059
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,475
They are observlng
and recordlng behavlor.

1060
01:13:58,547 --> 01:14:01,107
There are many levels, and the
flrst level Is behavlor number one.

1061
01:14:01,183 --> 01:14:03,651
N umber one Is slmply
normal human behavlor.

1062
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:05,243
There's no threat.
There's no red flag.

1063
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:07,881
When a moblle unlt
or a camera

1064
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:12,326
sees behavlor that Indlcates posslble
crlmlnal actlvlty Is In the works,

1065
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:17,331
It goes to level two. Stlll, no
human eye Is on the human belng.

1066
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:19,833
I can't get a signal down here.

1067
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:22,462
Come on, we've got to warn them.

1068
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:23,698
Let's go.

1069
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:28,807
Jlm, be careful.

1070
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:31,676
What? Maybe they can
help us get a signal.

1071
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:33,840
Guys, we need for you to get us-

1072
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,178
J im.

1073
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,048
No.

1074
01:16:07,243 --> 01:16:08,642
J im?

1075
01:16:10,846 --> 01:16:12,473
J im?

1076
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:37,665
Damn.

1077
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:43,102
Come on, Ed.

1078
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:49,807
Gunner, what the hell
happened to you?

1079
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:51,716
J im Bradley's dead.

1080
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,791
How?

1081
01:16:56,859 --> 01:16:58,326
The Eyeborgs have
been compromised.

1082
01:16:58,394 --> 01:16:59,793
How can the Eyeborgs
be compromised?

1083
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:01,329
And that's not
our only problem.

1084
01:17:01,397 --> 01:17:02,830
Jarett Hewes,
the president's nephew,

1085
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:05,833
has a bomb hidden
in his guitar.

1086
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:07,835
The kid's already
in the building.

1087
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:09,996
We'll secure
the perlmeter.

1088
01:17:10,072 --> 01:17:12,666
You take a team in and get
the president out of there.

1089
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,675
Yes, sir.

1090
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:16,836
Sanchez, get your
team together.

1091
01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:19,244
Let's not hurt the kid. He
doesn't know he's been set up.

1092
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:24,317
What's going on?
What happened?

1093
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,616
Terrorists have control
of the Eyeborgs,

1094
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:29,852
and Jarett's guitar is rigged
to assassinate the president.

1095
01:17:29,925 --> 01:17:31,984
That's not funny.

1096
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:36,862
No, you're right.
It's not.

1097
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:39,457
Round them up.
Move them out.

1098
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:40,866
What's the situation?

1099
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:42,597
The debates are
still going on

1100
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,434
but we can't contact
anyone on the radio.

1101
01:17:44,506 --> 01:17:45,700
Our first priority is
to get the president out.

1102
01:17:45,774 --> 01:17:46,866
U nderstood.

1103
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:47,874
Let's go, commander.

1104
01:17:47,943 --> 01:17:48,932
Yup. Sanchez?

1105
01:17:53,115 --> 01:17:56,744
D H S, Secret
Servlce. Stand down.

1106
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,446
Where are
the president's guards?

1107
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,015
I don't know. They should be here.

1108
01:18:08,797 --> 01:18:12,233
We're taking the president off-stage,
then we get him out of the building.

1109
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:14,667
Gunner, wait. Let's get a
twenty on that kid first.

1110
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:17,729
Coyle, take a team.

1111
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:19,899
I want you to sweep the bulldlng.

1112
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:22,239
Sanchez, I want you to do
a perlmeter wlth a team,

1113
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:23,744
and I want
the bomb squad-

1114
01:18:23,812 --> 01:18:25,871
Gunner, Gunner.

1115
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:45,164
It's not real.

1116
01:18:54,009 --> 01:18:58,946
Oh, Lord.
He's not real.

1117
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:02,541
What's going on?

1118
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:03,778
Where's the president?

1119
01:19:03,852 --> 01:19:04,944
There is no president.

1120
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,214
What?

1121
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:07,653
There is no president.

1122
01:19:09,191 --> 01:19:11,421
I don't understand.
Did terrorists-

1123
01:19:11,493 --> 01:19:13,620
There are no terrorists. No terrorists,

1124
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:17,187
no election, no president,
no more democracy.

1125
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:20,463
O D I N has
been using us.

1126
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,436
That's why we Invade one
country after another-

1127
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:24,631
So it can breed.

1128
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:26,071
You're recording
this, right?

1129
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:28,302
J ust keep recordlng

1130
01:19:28,377 --> 01:19:31,141
and sending it
to the station.

1131
01:19:31,213 --> 01:19:33,977
Where's Barbara's feed?

1132
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:35,812
It must be some
klnd of a problem

1133
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:36,976
wlth the robot camera we gave her.

1134
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:38,314
Have you called her?

1135
01:19:38,387 --> 01:19:40,617
There was no answer,

1136
01:19:40,689 --> 01:19:42,987
but there's nothlng for her
to do untll the debate's over.

1137
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:44,491
I suppose.

1138
01:19:46,361 --> 01:19:48,124
Well, no more.

1139
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:49,824
Not on my watch.

1140
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:51,297
I want that boy
out of here.

1141
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:11,078
Ed, can you hear me?

1142
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:12,415
Right here, right here.

1143
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:31,595
What do
we do now?

1144
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:35,268
Hlgh, low. On two.
One, two.

1145
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:42,815
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is unbelievable.

1146
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:45,877
There Is no presldent,

1147
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:49,185
no room of
Invlted supporters.

1148
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:51,351
We've got to get Jarett and
that bomb out of this building.

1149
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:53,223
O D I N wlll go
to any extreme,

1150
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:55,889
even kill our own
American heroes,

1151
01:20:55,964 --> 01:20:58,159
to keep It secret.

1152
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,564
Cover.

1153
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:03,733
No one knows
how long thls-

1154
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:07,905
Barbara.

1155
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:24,718
Barbara.

1156
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:45,574
What are you doing here? You all right?

1157
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:48,115
I can't move my legs.

1158
01:21:48,183 --> 01:21:49,912
We'll get you
out of here.

1159
01:21:49,985 --> 01:21:51,850
No, no, have you found Jarett yet?

1160
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,115
He's somewhere in the
building. I don't know where.

1161
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:59,582
The basement. They've
got him in the old jail.

1162
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:01,754
How do you know?

1163
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,422
I've done a mllllon
storles on thls place.

1164
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,795
It used to be the old federal building.

1165
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:06,163
We've got to
get past them.

1166
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:11,765
No, there's another way.
See that slot up there?

1167
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,603
It's part of the old
survelllance tunnels.

1168
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:15,404
They connect every room
In the bulldlng.

1169
01:22:15,477 --> 01:22:18,605
Oh. There's a door
behlnd that curtaln.

1170
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,409
You just get in there.

1171
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:23,781
You can get to the
basement and get Jarett out.

1172
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,323
Sanchez, send a bravo
team. Go with Gunner.

1173
01:22:35,397 --> 01:22:37,490
Go.

1174
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:47,741
Leave me the nine mil,
another clip, and I'll be fine.

1175
01:22:49,244 --> 01:22:51,371
Don't do
anything stupid.

1176
01:22:54,216 --> 01:22:57,276
We'll get you
on the way out.

1177
01:22:57,352 --> 01:23:00,344
Go, go,
go, go, go.

1178
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:07,924
Where is Barbara?

1179
01:23:07,996 --> 01:23:10,590
We have gunshot flre from
wlthln the Mlllennlum Center.

1180
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:41,760
Communications have been
compromised. Let's go quietly.

1181
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:41,648
Oh!

1182
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:42,102
Team, gol

1183
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:46,302
I'm here.

1184
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,844
Help, help.

1185
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:51,783
Help.

1186
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:02,889
You all rlght?

1187
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:05,262
Oh, my God, what's happening?
Where's U ncle Benjamin?

1188
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:06,823
He's dead.

1189
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:08,426
Probably has
been for years.

1190
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:10,266
But he's
the president.

1191
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:11,600
Not anymore.

1192
01:27:11,673 --> 01:27:13,937
What Is thls?

1193
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:16,307
I don't know. Some kind of
3- D scanner or something.

1194
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:28,422
Oh, God.

1195
01:27:30,191 --> 01:27:34,093
Ahh. Ahh.

1196
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:36,562
Let's be very careful with this.

1197
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,428
Thank you.

1198
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,195
Don't thank me. There's a bomb In It.

1199
01:27:56,184 --> 01:27:57,617
Go.

1200
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:07,026
Fall back.

1201
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,514
What's happening
out there?

1202
01:28:31,586 --> 01:28:33,850
As far as we know,
the presldent Is safe.

1203
01:28:33,922 --> 01:28:36,516
But we can nelther conflrm
nor deny at thls tlme.

1204
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:52,997
What the hell
are those?

1205
01:28:53,074 --> 01:28:54,871
An Eyeborg no human ever designed.

1206
01:28:57,879 --> 01:28:59,870
Coyle, what'd they do to you, man?

1207
01:28:59,948 --> 01:29:01,813
Jesus.

1208
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:19,224
Come on.

1209
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,858
Gunner.

1210
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:26,373
Gunner, take
the guitar.

1211
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:28,671
Get him out.
I got you covered.

1212
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:30,108
No, Sanchez.
Come back, San-

1213
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:41,748
Barbara.

1214
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:05,473
Jarett!

1215
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:16,617
Jarett, son,
come here, son.

1216
01:30:16,691 --> 01:30:17,885
Come here.

1217
01:30:17,959 --> 01:30:20,450
Look at me,
look at me.

1218
01:30:20,528 --> 01:30:21,927
I need you
on your feet.

1219
01:30:21,996 --> 01:30:23,020
All right?
You understand?

1220
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:24,395
Okay!

1221
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:26,127
All right,
give me your arm.

1222
01:30:38,379 --> 01:30:40,643
Come on.
Come on!

1223
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:48,982
Gunner, what happened
to the others?

1224
01:30:49,057 --> 01:30:50,547
Doesn't matter.
We got to go.

1225
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:51,990
Oh, no. Oh, God.

1226
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,220
No, you
can't move me.

1227
01:30:53,294 --> 01:30:54,659
Yes, I can.

1228
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:56,253
Take Jarett.
I can barely walk.

1229
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:57,821
Come on, we haven't got much time!

1230
01:30:57,899 --> 01:30:59,594
No, you take Jarett and take these.

1231
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,294
These are the computer
chips from my camera.

1232
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:02,802
They'll have everything
that happened today.

1233
01:31:02,871 --> 01:31:04,634
They'll be the last
recorded video.

1234
01:31:04,706 --> 01:31:06,833
It's the only proof you'll
have of what happened.

1235
01:31:06,908 --> 01:31:08,102
Barbara.

1236
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:11,234
I'm taking you out.

1237
01:31:11,312 --> 01:31:12,643
Promise me you'll take these out.

1238
01:31:12,714 --> 01:31:13,772
Promise me, Gunner!
Promise me!

1239
01:31:13,848 --> 01:31:15,941
Yes.
I promise.

1240
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:17,678
All right, look, you
promise me something-

1241
01:31:17,752 --> 01:31:20,152
Whatever comes through
that door, do not move.

1242
01:31:20,221 --> 01:31:22,815
They are programmed
to attack. Do not move.

1243
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:25,860
And I will be
back for you.

1244
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,361
I know. I know.

1245
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:30,329
I know.

1246
01:31:36,604 --> 01:31:41,166
Come on, son. I'm
getting you out of here.

1247
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:44,370
Come on,
look at me.

1248
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,811
Look at me. You can do
this. Put your arm around me.

1249
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:02,725
Agaln, I'm not sure If
gunshots have been flred,

1250
01:32:02,797 --> 01:32:06,289
or If It's somethlng that sounds
llke gunshots. Standlng by.

1251
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:01,951
Do you know what I've got here?

1252
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:05,957
The delete key.

1253
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:26,302
No.

1254
01:34:16,364 --> 01:34:21,027
I, Thomas Rutledge,
do solemnly swear-

1255
01:34:21,102 --> 01:34:28,708
That I wlll falth fully execute the
offlce of presldent of the U nlted States-

Footage just released, showlng
the former vlce presldent

1258
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:36,341

1259
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:39,875
and assumlng hls posltlon
as the next U. S. presldent.

1260
01:34:39,954 --> 01:34:42,354
Welcome to Eyewltness
News. I'm Jack Romero.

1261
01:34:42,423 --> 01:34:44,653
And I'm
Jlll Coppola.

1262
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:46,353
The new commander-In-chlef
wasted no tlme

1263
01:34:46,427 --> 01:34:48,224
deploylng a
coordlnated assault

1264
01:34:48,296 --> 01:34:51,732
Involvlng army, navy

1265
01:34:51,799 --> 01:34:55,895
agalnst the tlny, oll-produclng
natlon of Zlmbeklstan.

1266
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:59,371
We have Irrefutable proof
that Zlmbeklstan Is Involved

1267
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,840
beyond the funds glven
to the traltor Jarett Hewes

1268
01:35:01,909 --> 01:35:05,845
for hls Involvement In thls
terrorlst assasslnatlon plot.

1269
01:35:05,913 --> 01:35:07,904
Sad to say that we
dare not trust anyone,

1270
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:10,212
not even our
own relatlves.

1271
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:13,378
My admlnlstratlon has
just begun Implementlng

1272
01:35:13,454 --> 01:35:15,581
sophlstlcated
securlty provlslons

1273
01:35:15,656 --> 01:35:18,386
deslgned to protect you.

1274
01:35:18,459 --> 01:35:22,919
Wlth that, God bless you,
and God bless Amerlca.

1275
01:35:22,997 --> 01:35:24,259
Sam.

1276
01:35:24,332 --> 01:35:27,927
Thanks, man.
See you soon.

1277
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:31,403
What about
that vldeo?

1278
01:35:31,472 --> 01:35:34,771
Everybody knows that
vldeos can be faked.

1279
01:35:34,842 --> 01:35:36,434
Regardless of the
motlves of people,

1280
01:35:36,511 --> 01:35:38,911
they're deslgned
to confused you,

1281
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:42,108
so you must ask yourself, each
and every cltlzen of thls country,

1282
01:35:42,183 --> 01:35:46,586
ask yourself one questlon
and one questlon only-

1283
01:35:46,654 --> 01:35:49,953
Who do you belleve?

1284
01:35:50,024 --> 01:35:53,790
A government that Is
sworn to protect you,

1285
01:35:53,861 --> 01:35:58,093
or a ratlngs-hungry
medla beholden to no one?

1286
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,313
Dude, thls outflt
so does not work for me.

1287
01:36:25,893 --> 01:36:28,726
Eyeborgs use visual
pattern recognition.

1288
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:35,460
Besides, you
look good in it.

1289
01:36:35,536 --> 01:36:37,800
Really, man? Here?
I mean, just-

1290
01:36:37,872 --> 01:36:41,831
It was either here
or the exotic car wash.

1291
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:44,343
I thought this would be
better for your soul.

1292
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:46,073
H mm. Wanna know
my preference?

1293
01:36:46,147 --> 01:36:48,513
Oh, no, I don't.

1294
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:51,017
The world thinks
I'm dead already.

1295
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:54,020
Look, we go
public with this,

1296
01:36:54,088 --> 01:36:55,851
and I get out there
In front of cameras-

1297
01:36:55,923 --> 01:36:58,016
Trust me, it's been
done with cameras before.

1298
01:36:58,092 --> 01:37:01,858
Gunner, I can't just
slt here and do nothlng

1299
01:37:01,929 --> 01:37:04,261
whlle people
are out there dylng.

1300
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:08,860
Barbara's-Barbara's video has
gone viral all over the net.

1301
01:37:08,936 --> 01:37:11,029
It's spreading like
crazy, going peer-to-peer.

1302
01:37:11,105 --> 01:37:13,665
Even O D I N
can't stop it.

1303
01:37:17,111 --> 01:37:21,878
So what do we do?

1304
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:24,042
Be patient.

1305
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:28,885
People aren't just accepting
what they hear anymore.

1306
01:37:28,956 --> 01:37:33,052
Things are changing.

1307
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:37,063
We have to
stop the machine.

1308
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:41,067
We will.

1309
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:44,070
Have faith, my son.

1310
01:37:44,138 --> 01:37:46,572
Thank you, Father.

1311
01:38:46,334 --> 01:38:49,303
The Lord gave me my
eyes to see for myself.

1312
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:51,634
I don't need
yours anymore.

1313
01:39:07,054 --> 01:39:09,989
# I'm not a bellever

01:40:03,744 --> 01:40:06,679
Coming up next on Eyewitness News
44 H D, a nation mourns the loss

1330
01:40:06,747 --> 01:40:11,047
of its longest-sitting leader
since F D R and recalls his legacy.

1331
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:13,518
All the while, even
under more tight security,

1332
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:17,216
the Vice President is sworn in as
the nation's new commander-in-chief.

1333
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,057
Also, U S condemnation of
Zimbekistan for the attack,

1334
01:40:21,128 --> 01:40:25,497
and threats of military
retaliation against the tiny nation

1335
01:40:25,566 --> 01:40:29,229
in response
to the unprecedented-

1336
01:40:29,303 --> 01:40:31,794
No one knows how long
O D I N has perpetrated thls-

1337
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,806
And builds
a new coalition

1338
01:40:33,874 --> 01:40:37,640
A presldent that's merely
an artlflclal flgurehead.

1339
01:40:37,712 --> 01:40:39,407
...nation.

1340
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,244
U h, clearly some kind
of technical problem there.

1341
01:40:42,316 --> 01:40:46,082
Some kind of
a ghost-like-

1342
01:40:46,153 --> 01:40:49,088
We're not quite sure
what that was we just saw.

1343
01:40:49,156 --> 01:40:50,851
Perhaps some kind
of practical joke

1344
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:52,483
by somebody with a very
sick sense of humor.

1345
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,391
But I'm sure the F C C and this network

1346
01:40:54,462 --> 01:40:57,090
will investigate and
prosecute those responsible.

1347
01:40:57,164 --> 01:41:00,099
Meantime, we apologize
for the interruption.

1348
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:04,103
We hope you'll stay with us through
the break and into our next program.

1349
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:06,002
Stay tuned, and thank you.

1350
01:41:07,341 --> 01:41:09,104
Was that-?

1351
01:41:09,176 --> 01:41:10,404
Damndest thing
