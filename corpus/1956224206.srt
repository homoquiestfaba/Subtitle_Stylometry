you gonna show up.

Hi.

385
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:44,796
I'll have a Scotch, neat
and whatever he wants.

387
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:46,731

Thank you for waiting.

391
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,243
No problem.

392
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:01,279
I'm gonna be really honest.

393
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,315
I know there are
a lot of fighters

394
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,282
that are better
than the big names

395
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:07,284
but they don't have
managers like Ben Green

396
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,753
giving kickbacks to the league.

397
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:12,624
He and I had a very
interesting conversation today.

398
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:13,657
Yeah?

399
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:14,527
Yeah.

400
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:29,773
I think this story
is the first step

401
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:32,111
to change the entire game.

402
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,519

So, Ty Matthews.

408
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:01,039
Now that was a sparring
session, not a real fight?

409
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,607
No, I'd beat him
in a real fight.

410
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,809
Oh yeah, what
makes you think so?

411
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:06,211
Look, there are guys

412
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,811
that don't even wanna
lose in practice.

413
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:09,350
He's one of them.

414
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,216
Got a little too cocky.

415
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:14,118
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

416
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,953
That must've felt good.

417
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:18,990
Better than sex.

418
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,425
Could you describe that?

419
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:23,296

to talk about sex.

423

Why not?

424
00:25:33,674 --> 00:25:37,008
I don't think my girlfriend
would like it too much.

You don't seem too
happy about that.

00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:50,588
No, I love her.

Okay.

431
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:58,096
So, we have to talk
about something else.

Have you known him

My mom died when I was 13.

440

Pete took me when I ran
away from a foster care.

441
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:34,667
Well, he sounds more like
a father than a trainer.

Yeah.

443
00:26:38,504 --> 00:26:40,437
When I had nowhere
to go, he took me in.

444
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,542
Gave me job at the gym.

445
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,280
And he taught me how to fight.

446
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:51,648
I'll probably in jail
if wasn't for him.

447
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,652
I'm sorry.

me how you beat Marco.

00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,732
I can't show
people that video.

451
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,569
But I can have my guy
from the gym show you.

452

Well, I don't
wanna see the video

453
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,940
and I don't want your friend
at the gym to show me either.

get me thrown in jail

461
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:34,759

especially like this?

around his neck like this.

552
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:53,744
I think a lady has a gripe
and I gotta follow through.

553
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:56,112
So Ty, my goodness.

554
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:57,547
Ty and the ladies.

555
00:37:57,549 --> 00:37:58,648
Yeah, well.

556
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,016
Come on, I'll introduce you.

557
00:38:00,018 --> 00:38:03,223
Don't tell me don't
miss those days.

558
00:38:04,556 --> 00:38:05,390
Yeah.

559
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:09,759
Hey Ty, this mas has a
few questions for you.

560
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:12,164
Ty Matthews, how are you?

561
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,933
Yeah, who are you?

562
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,536
I'm Detective John Beckett.

563
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:20,837
I just got a couple
of questions.

564
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:22,374
If you don't mind.

565
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:25,108
Pete, what's this all about?

566
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,476
You tell me.

567
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,114
No, it's alright.

568
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,646
I'd rather not talk here.

569
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:32,016
I'd rather go to somewhere
a little more private

570
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,583
like down in my office.

571
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,453
I'll be back inside an hour.

572
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:38,958
If you wanna come
talk to me, 'right.

573
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:43,963
You don't have to.

574
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,099
It's unofficial.

575
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,101
But you'll help me out.

576
00:38:53,572 --> 00:38:55,041
Fucking asshole.

577
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,277
Not you, me.

578
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:02,579
You can't have this up here.

579
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:06,319
I was supposed to
check it in downstairs.

580
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:13,690
Have your permission
to look inside?

581
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:17,927
Otherwise, I gotta go
downstairs and check it up.

582
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,031
Sure.

583
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:25,069
Are there scissors
here or anything sharp?

584
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,936
Knife or razor blade
and where you cut?

585
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:27,973
No.

586
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:30,877
You know.

587
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,478
I got this ex-partner, Jimmy.

588
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,748
He's obsessed with
Asian culture, you know.

589
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:42,288
Like tai chi, martial arts,
married an Asian girl.

590
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:47,560
Anyway, he's got me drinking
32 ounces of warm water

591
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:51,128
everyday when I wake up.

592
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,834
I've been doing it for
like four weeks now.

593
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:59,036
The philosophy or the
ideology behind it

594
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:02,072
is that your body
has been sleeping

595
00:40:02,074 --> 00:40:05,208
for four, six, eight,
10 hours a night, right?

596
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,478
You're completely
dehydrated when you wake up.

597
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,380
So, this, when you
drink the water,

598
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:12,616
it kick starts your
system and reboots it

599
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,317
and I'm telling you,

600
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,985
it flushes your whole system
because nothing in your body,

601
00:40:15,987 --> 00:40:18,355
nothing there, it's like a
plunger, the water goes down,

602
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:20,190
everything out,
everything clean.

603
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:24,128
Hey, what is this
have to do with me?

604
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,198
Nothing.

605
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:27,864
I figured since you
were an athlete,

606
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:30,102
maybe you heard of that.

607
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:35,340
You're a boxer, right?

608
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,875
No, I practice MMA.

609
00:40:39,877 --> 00:40:41,313
Practice MMA.

610
00:40:42,214 --> 00:40:45,351
You hit people
for a living, yeah?

611
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:47,985
You could say that.

612
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,688
Would you say that
you're a violent person?

613
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,188
But man, what's
this all about?

614
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,824
Do I need a attorney
or something?

615
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:56,694
I don't know.

616
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:57,563
Do you?

617
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,168
(RECORDER BEEPS)

618
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,971
VICTORIA: So, Ty Matthews.

619
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:12,141
So that was just a sparring
session, not a real fight?

620
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:13,511
TY: I would beat
him in a real fight.

621
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,478
VICTORIA: Oh yeah,
what makes you think so?

622
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,081
TY: Look, there's some guys

623
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,315
that don't even wanna
lose in practice.

624
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:20,349
He's one of them.

625
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:21,719
He got a little too cocky.

626
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:24,154
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

627
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:27,190
VICTORIA: That
must've felt good.

628
00:41:27,192 --> 00:41:29,227
TY: Better than sex.

629
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:35,467
That's Victoria Mata,

630
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:40,036
was voice you heard on the tape.

631
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:41,707
You know her right?

632
00:41:42,975 --> 00:41:44,074
Yeah.

633
00:41:44,076 --> 00:41:47,009
What time was the interview?

634
00:41:47,011 --> 00:41:48,378
10 p.m.

635
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,047
What did you do
after the interview?

636
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,014
I went home.

637
00:41:51,016 --> 00:41:52,282
What time was that?

638
00:41:52,284 --> 00:41:53,150
Fuck, man.

639
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:54,150
I don't know.

640
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:55,554
JOHN: Think.

641
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:58,657
I go home at 12:30.

642
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:03,960
You can ask my girl,
she'll vouch for me.

643
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:06,963
But the meeting with
Victoria start was at 10 p.m.

644
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:09,666
She was a little late.

645
00:42:09,668 --> 00:42:10,933
Tell me.

646
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,335
The tape's only 30 minutes long,

647
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:15,741
what did you do in
the rest of the time?

648
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:21,411
She's a good looking girl.

649
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:24,415
Have a predilection
for fighters.

650
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,552
Maybe she added you up.

651
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,889
Flirted with you a little
bit, touched your leg.

652
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:35,726
You guys got a little
liquored up, maybe.

653
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:38,594
And she takes ya home
back home to her place

654
00:42:38,596 --> 00:42:40,529
and things get out of hand.

655
00:42:40,531 --> 00:42:43,368
One thing leads to another and.

656
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,137
What are you talking about?

657
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:50,174
Well, a predilection
for fighters

658
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:51,141
means that she liked you.

659
00:42:51,143 --> 00:42:52,009
She had a thing for...

660
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:53,409
No, no man.

661
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:56,815
What do you mean things
things got out of hand?

00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:14,598
Do you think I killed her?

668
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,233
I don't know.

669
00:43:16,235 --> 00:43:17,601
Why would I kill her?

670
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:18,771
I don't know.

671
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:24,574
What was that thing
you said on the tape?

672
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:28,414
You said winning a fight
is better than sex.

673
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,351
Is that true?

674
00:43:38,456 --> 00:43:42,328
Speaking of hydration,
I gotta take a piss.

675
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:46,299
Can I get you anything?

No.

somewhere around 3 a.m.

She was strangled.

else like DNA,

the girlfriend?

686
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:14,558
She works at a nail salon,

687
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,326
I'm gonna go talk to her now.

688
00:44:16,328 --> 00:44:17,194
You know it just works.

689
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,264
Get to it.

690
00:44:25,103 --> 00:44:27,103
I know what you did.

691
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:28,505
You know what you did

692
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:31,144
so let's just cut the shit.

693
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:35,612
I didn't do anything.

694
00:44:35,614 --> 00:44:38,150
You at least fucked her.

695
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:40,884
That much is for sure.

696
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,219
What do you mean?

697
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,587
Are you gonna sit
here and tell me

698
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:46,255
that nothing happened
between you two?

699
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:47,690
I mean she interviewed me.

700
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:49,092
That's about it.

701
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:51,061
How'd you do it?

702
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,561
Huh?

703
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:53,864
You get to do things to her

704
00:44:53,866 --> 00:44:57,170
that your girlfriend
won't let you?

705
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:01,840
That's how it
happened, isn't it?

706
00:45:04,275 --> 00:45:07,009
I'm not saying
another word to you.

707
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:08,978
And where's my phone call?

But just so you know, Ty,

711
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:25,931
I will find out exactly
what happened eventually.

712
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:32,405
Enjoy your phone call.

713
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,412
Yeah?

714
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:42,781

716
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:50,320
Yeah.

717
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:52,188
I need to speak with you?

718
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,523
I'm on my break, actually

719
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:55,025
but one of the other
girls can help you out.

720
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:59,432
This is regarding your
boyfriend, Ty Matthews.

721
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,572
So you said he was home
right around 12:30.

722
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:12,675
So, would you say
definitely before 1 a.m.?

723
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:15,344
Yeah, he was definitely home.

724
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:16,448
Okay.

725
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,018
Is he in trouble?

726
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,455
He might be.

727
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,665
Is that blood?

728
00:46:33,364 --> 00:46:34,466
What?

729
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:36,701
On your shirt.

730
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:40,503
Oh, yeah.

731
00:46:40,505 --> 00:46:44,541
I always get blood on
me from patching up Ty.

732
00:46:44,543 --> 00:46:46,076

PETE: Ty!

919
00:57:58,382 --> 00:58:01,986
Close the door
behind you, would you?

920
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:09,127
Liked the video.

921
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,429
Well, I guess you
want your money back.

922
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:16,065
No, not necessarily.

923
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,866
Marco liked it.

924
00:58:17,868 --> 00:58:20,604
So the two million other people.

925
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:26,677
Thank you for meeting me.

926
00:58:27,645 --> 00:58:28,612
Have a seat.

927
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,052
Can I get you
something to drink?

928
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,054
Are you trying to tell
me that I'll need one?

929
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:39,924
Maybe.

930
00:58:41,025 --> 00:58:45,094
So how does a hundred
thousand dollars sound to you?

931
00:58:45,096 --> 00:58:46,929
Sounds like a lot of money.

932
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:48,297
Well, congratulations.

933
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:50,701
This is your lucky day, Ty.

934
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:56,574
They want you to fight
Marco for the title.

935
00:58:58,476 --> 00:59:00,509
Finally get your
fight with Marco.

936
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:01,242
When?

937
00:59:01,244 --> 00:59:02,478
Two weeks.

938
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,681
Our event, our rules.

939
00:59:04,683 --> 00:59:07,116
You know that's not
enough time for anyone

940
00:59:07,118 --> 00:59:09,018
to be ready for a
fight like this.

941
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,253
Yes, it is.

942
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:14,523
You think Ty
killed that reporter?

943
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:16,728
I don't know if he did.

944
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:20,498
He maybe has a legitimate alibi.

945
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:26,505
I will beat him anytime, any
rules, any place, whenever.

946
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:30,574
I was hoping you'd day that.

947
00:59:32,842 --> 00:59:34,446
Do we have a deal?

948
00:59:37,681 --> 00:59:38,549

949
00:59:42,987 --> 00:59:45,753
I know this isn't easy for you.

950
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:48,958
But you know why I
brought you here?

951
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,429
I brought you to this bar
because this is the last place

952
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:56,368
Victoria was seen alive with Ty.

953
00:59:58,034 --> 00:59:59,136
Right here.

954
01:00:00,804 --> 01:00:02,808
This seat in particular.

955
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:10,079
This is where Ty sat the
night she died and you,

956
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:14,449
Whitney, you were seating
where Victoria sat.

957
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:16,518
I'll have to send
the details over later.

958
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,121
Pete, I assume
you're his manager.

959
01:00:19,123 --> 01:00:20,857
Well, I have to discuss...

960
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:21,726
Yeah.

961
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,130
He's my manager.

962
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,462
Well, good.

963
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:29,200
I will leave you.

You guys have a
lot of work to do.

965
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,146
Got a title fight, Pete.

966
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:46,184
And then he reached over.

967
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,186
Kinda like this.

968
01:00:51,288 --> 01:00:54,758
And he brushed the
hair off of her face.

969
01:00:57,161 --> 01:00:59,494
He had sex with her.

970
01:00:59,496 --> 01:01:03,768
His DNA matches the semen
we found inside of her.

971
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:10,341
This man, he isn't
who you think he is.

972
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:14,679
He's dangerous.

973
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:20,482
The man that you sleep next to,

974
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:22,487
that man is a killer.

975
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:26,157
So let me help you.

was home by 12:30?

Nothing.

1289

He was upset I was
rooting for Marco

1290
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:36,029
and he savagely attacked me.

1291
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:38,565

or Matthews' attacked him.

1458
01:40:11,847 --> 01:40:13,846
you're against us.

1459
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:16,716
But I wanna thank you for
a great show (CHUCKLES).

1460
01:40:16,718 --> 01:40:19,121
You're a hell of a fighter.

1461
01:40:20,155 --> 01:40:21,521
I won that fight.

1462
01:40:21,523 --> 01:40:26,061
Yeah, I know you won the
fight and lost the war.

1463
01:40:28,330 --> 01:40:31,264
Hey, if you wanna be a winner,

1464
01:40:31,266 --> 01:40:35,204
you gotta know the game,
your plan and the rules.

1465
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:38,070
Like your buddy.

1466
01:40:38,072 --> 01:40:38,975
Jameson?

1467
01:40:40,476 --> 01:40:42,809
Ah, he's a winner.

1468
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:44,847
And young and strong.

1469
01:40:46,481 --> 01:40:48,117
He knows the game.

(FAINT BROODING MUSIC)

1471
01:40:59,828 --> 01:41:03,699
Oh, he would do anything
the be a champion.

1472
01:41:07,835 --> 01:41:08,902
You know, there's a lot of money

1473
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:10,470
to be made in this business.

1474
01:41:10,472 --> 01:41:14,310
And I make my money by
any means necessary.

You killed her, didn't
you, you motherfucker.

1477
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:42,605
Some have a shelf life
just longer than others.

1479

Like I told you.

Don't fuck with things

1481
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:20,676
that are way beyond
your comprehension.

1482
01:42:21,942 --> 01:42:23,676
I'm gonna get outta here.

(SCOFFS)

1484
01:42:25,114 --> 01:42:28,150
And when I do, I'm
gonna kill you.

1485
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:32,752
I don't think
you're taking this in.

1486
01:42:32,754 --> 01:42:35,555
See, this is your home now.

1487
01:42:35,557 --> 01:42:36,924
This cage is the only place

1488
01:42:36,926 --> 01:42:40,096
you're gonna be
fighting for a while.

1489
01:42:41,996 --> 01:42:43,895
Why'd you do this to me?

1490
01:42:43,897 --> 01:42:45,634
I hate to lose.

1491
01:42:46,735 --> 01:42:48,771
I take it personally.

1492
01:42:52,740 --> 01:42:54,776
You take care, champ.

1493
01:43:14,596 --> 01:43:17,898
We have here this
evening, Marco Reign.

1494
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,498
Of course, I'm still champ.

1495
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,001
That punk got lucky.

1496
01:43:21,003 --> 01:43:24,070
I'll fight that guy
again anytime, any place.

1497
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:26,275

to your ear?

Man, I was getting down
with this chick, right.

1501
01:44:13,187 --> 01:44:15,421
She's hot too she used
to being grab my ear

and scratch my shit.
