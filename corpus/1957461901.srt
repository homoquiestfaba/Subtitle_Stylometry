00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:53,025
Hey, Luke, you should do some
of your new material for us.

177
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:55,961
- Oh, I don't think so. No.
- Come on.

178
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,997
No, it'll help you, you know,
get ready for the show.

179
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,165
Come on.

180
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,066
I think we should
just leave him alone.

181
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,435
Come on. Do it.
Just say something funny.

182
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:05,471
Do something about lawyers.

183
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,706
Yeah, I'd like to hear
some of your material.

184
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,175
Come on.

185
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,876
Luke, Luke,
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke,

186
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,246
Luke, Luke,
Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke!

187
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:21,086
All right!
I'll do one joke. One joke.

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,422
Normally, I prefer my crowd
has a few drinks in them...

189
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,994
[laughing loudly]

190
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:32,865
That... That wasn't the bit yet.

191
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:35,100
Genius.

192
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:39,371
- All right, uh...
- Oh, Luke. Luke Hudson.

193
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:42,508
Thanks. But, you guys
have been an amazing crowd.

194
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,043
I'll be here all weekend.

195
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:45,277
Tip the wait staff.

196
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,246
[applause]

197

198
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,783
Oh, pizza's here.
Pizza! Pizza time!

199
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:55,187
And this is where
we get to bunk up together.

200
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,455
Who'd have
thought I'd be hanging out

201
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,290
with Luke Hudson all weekend?

202
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:00,159
This is going to be hilarious.

203
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,994
Yeah, they didn't tell me
you were coming either.

204
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:05,030
Wait, hold up. Hold up.

205
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,165
Here we go.

206
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:08,133
- [camera clicking]
- Yeah.

207
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,437
Oh, my boys
are going to be so jealous.

208
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,439
#Besties!

209
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,478
It's Bryce, right?

210
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,779
Yeah.

211
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,983
Okay. Word on
the street is you're a lawyer?

212
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:26,051
Yeah.
Bryce Jones, Esquire. Lawyer.

213
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,486
That's right. That's right.

214
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,823
Look, can I ask you
a legal question?

215
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:34,460
It's off the books,
just, like, between colleagues.

216
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:36,929
- Sure.
- So, okay.

217
00:10:36,962 --> 00:10:40,266
Say I have this friend who's
dating this girl I don't like,

218
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,002
and I somehow figure out
how to break them up.

219
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,938
Could that girl then sue me?

220
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,208
Well, I guess she could sue you
for punitive damages.

221
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:54,546
Right, punitive. Of course.

222
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:57,950
But that isn't
very likely, is it?

223
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,519
Well, depends on the person,
is this someone you know?

224
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:03,155
No, no. It's just...
it's hypothetical.

225
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,457
You know, I just, um...

226
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,960
like talking legal...

227
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,262
punitive damages and such.

228
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,868
But you wouldn't sue someone
if it happened to you, right?

229
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,970
Oh, probably not.

230
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,874
Great. That's it.
Oh, that was easy.

231
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,475
Great talk. See you, Luke.

232
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,545

- What?
- Help me.

235
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,120
How long
have you been in there?

236
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:37,089
You've got to help me.

237
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,957
I'm being poisoned.

238
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,026
Look at this.

239
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,461
There's no gluten in it.

240
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,264
You might as well
cook me horse manure

241
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,567
with chocolate chips
all over it.

242
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:52,037
That's not a bad idea.

243
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,107
Either one of you kids
have some chocolate chips?

244
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:00,079
Hello, sir,
I'm Bryce Jones, Esquire.

245
00:12:00,112 --> 00:12:02,014
I'm not interested
in your handshake unless

246
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,316
you're about
to slip me some Twinkies.

247
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,353
Got any Twinkies on you?

248
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,022
Uh...

249
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,391
Should have brought Twinkies.

250
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:17,963
Don't you realize that
the guest is supposed to bring

251
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:22,000
the head of the household
a baked good when he comes in?

252
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:26,071
If you'd made
this misstep in olden days,

253
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,440
it would have
cost you both your arms!

254
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:37,082
Well, I guess I'll just
come out and ask already!

255
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:41,420
How serious is it with Bryce?

256
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,322
Thanks for not
beating around the bush.

257
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:45,924
Well, you know,
no time for small talk.

258
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,227
Been married for 13 years.

259
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,029
I need gossip, girlfriend.

260
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,966
Well, I brought him home
for Thanksgiving,

261
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,601
so it's kind of serious.

262
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,137
I mean,
we're focused on our careers,

263
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,272
so we don't talk about
the future that much. But...

264
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:04,476
We fit together,
if that makes sense.

265
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,611
Totally.

266
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,213
But, like,
is it going to be a little bit

267
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,315
weird with Luke here?

268
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:13,118
Yeah. Thanks for the heads up
on that, by the way.

269
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:16,054
I just thought, you know, like,
the surprise of my brother

270
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,090
being here
would just, you know,

271
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:20,292
add a little spice
to the holidays.

272
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,196
- [scoffing]
- Tell me,

273
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,598
how did you immediately feel
when you saw Luke?

274
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,234
I don't like
where this is going.

275
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,103
Better just to face it head on.

276
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:33,706
Fine.

277
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,409
It was shock, and then dread,

278
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,580
and then just
a little pinch of excitement.

279
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,450
Yes, I knew it.

280
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:46,653
- I knew it.
- Settle down.

281
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,987
We broke up. It's over.

282
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,659
I mean, if it was over,
why did he agree

283
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:55,662
to spend the whole week
with your family,

284
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:58,130
knowing that you were
going to be here?

285
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:00,032
He's a stand-up comedian.

286
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:01,600
This is a great place
to gather material.

287
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:04,470
Right.

288
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:08,607
It doesn't matter anyway.
I'm perfectly happy with Bryce.

289
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,277
Perfectly happy.

290
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,346
I mean, it's not
necessarily how I would

291
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,282
describe my soulmate, but...

292
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:18,984
You know what I mean?

293
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:21,688
Totally.

294
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,389
Listen up.

295
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,659
We're all in this together.

You, me and the new stiff here.

297
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,635
Without pumpkin pie, there's...
there's no use to living.

298
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,639
Well, I mean, I don't eat
any gluten either, so.

- By choice?
- Sure.

301
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,544
Seriously?

302
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:49,314
Now, I want you to put
your young heads together

303
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,751
and figure out some way
to get me pumpkin pie.

never happened.

Well, it's time for pizza,

310
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:12,739

to the soup kitchen soon.

you never mentioned him before.

with my boyfriend.

- You dated him?
- Yeah.

with Luke Hudson?

No, he would not do that.

00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,659
Right. Time for bed, Dad.

523
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:04,964
Oh, and it's
a dead end around here,

524
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:07,199
so I might as well.

525
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:10,870
Grandpa, do you need some help?

526
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:14,073
I'm old school, sweetie.

527
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:19,345
You save all that for
your gluten-free yuppie friend.

528
00:25:20,813 --> 00:25:24,016
I bet he lets you drive him
around town, too, doesn't he?

529
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:26,886
[laughing]

530
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:32,391
Oh. I forgot to tell you,

531
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:37,196
I broke one of your
good China dishes, Peaches.

532
00:25:37,229 --> 00:25:41,300
Dad, I told
you not to climb up here!

533
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:48,007
[quirky jazz music]

534
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:51,277
Did you give him the... Dad!

535
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:58,484
Did I just see your grandpa
shoving an entire plate

536
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:00,019
of cookies down
the front of his pants?

537
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:01,453
Probably.

538
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:03,055
Well,
that's as authentic as it gets.

539
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:04,456
For the Banks family.

540
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,160
What's a guy gotta do
to get one of those?

541
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:13,465
Where's that one guy
who followed you here?

542
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,937
That guy is a morning person,
so he's in bed.

543
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,877
Lulu's.

544
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,745
Reminds me of our first date.

545
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,949
You mean the time that
you asked for my phone number

546
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,784
at Charlie and Annie's wedding,

547
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:34,086
but did not call me
for three years? That time?

548
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,821
Yeah, that's the one.

549
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:40,726
What took you so long?

550
00:26:41,794 --> 00:26:43,162
Well, if you think about it,

551
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:45,064
we were basically
related at that point.

552
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:46,332
Gross. Stop that.

553
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,502
Lulu's did have
amazing pie, though.

554
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:52,871
I wouldn't know
because you always ate mine.

555
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,873
Well, you know what they say.

556
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,243
If there's pumpkin pie on the
table, you should eat it all.

557
00:26:57,276 --> 00:26:59,478
I think Grandpa Joe's the only
person who would say that.

558
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:02,748
Exactly, and that
man is a dessert genius.

559
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:08,954
And, uh...

560
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:11,790
I also think
you should take your time

561
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:15,961
if that person
might be forever.

562
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,502
I'm going
to take a drink of this

563
00:27:23,535 --> 00:27:25,804
and kill the awkward silence.

564
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:26,905
Good idea.

565
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:31,510
Mm.

566
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:32,811
So good.

567
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:36,248
I'm going to go to bed.

568
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:37,816
We never should have broken up.

569
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,385
- What?
- It was stupid of me.

570
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,153
I thought I was doing
the chivalrous thing

571
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:42,955
by letting you
follow your dreams.

572
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,492
But the truth is I was scared.

573
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,329
Our paths were diverging.
I panicked.

574
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,831
We should have
just made it work.

575
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:54,967
Why are you telling me this?

576
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,335
Because I need you to know.

577
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,908
Luke, you really hurt me.

578
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,311
I had to move on.

579
00:28:05,344 --> 00:28:07,012
I'm with that guy now.

580
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:12,151
I know, I just...

581
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:14,186
I figured if we're gonna spend
the whole week together,

582
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,555
we should take that elephant in
the room for a ride, you know?

583
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:20,059
Look, I'm really
proud of you, Sam.

584
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,063
I'm proud of who you are,
I'm proud of who you've become,

585
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,331
and I'm happy for you.

586
00:28:26,932 --> 00:28:28,534
I'm even happy for that guy...

587
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:32,639
even if I still
have feelings for...

588
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:34,173
Feelings for who?

589
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,476
Where did you get a cookie?

590
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,611
Grandpa Joe said I could have
it as long as I kept quiet.

591
00:28:39,646 --> 00:28:41,413
It's got a ton of gluten.

592
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:44,149
I know, but I really
want Grandpa Joe to like me,

593
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:45,317
so I took it.

594
00:28:47,386 --> 00:28:49,321
Oh, I will have one of those.

595
00:28:49,355 --> 00:28:50,989
This is hot chocolate.

596
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,524
I will have a water then.

597
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:53,959
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:02,534
So what were
you guys talking about?

Who has feelings for who?

601
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:07,206
No, I was just doing
a new bit I'm working on.

602
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,041
It's about the ex-girlfriend

603
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:10,943
and how the rebound guy
never ends up working out.

Are you okay?

You okay there, Esquire?

607
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:21,420
[Bryce] Yeah!

608
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:24,957
Oh, that is so true.

609
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,492
So true.

610
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,696
Well, I think
I'll go take one more shower

611
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:34,634
and get out of here before my
comedy actually kills someone.

612

Don't stay
up too late, you two.

00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,791
As much as I would love
to see you do that,

873
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:07,159
probably not the best idea.

874
00:41:07,793 --> 00:41:09,261
You would?

875
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:12,131
- I read you.
- What?

876
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:16,368
Look, I know you and Samantha
have a history together,

877
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:18,237
so I'm sure
this can't be easy for you.

878
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:21,674
Oh, nonsense,
that's so... you know.

879
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:23,909
How long you guys
been together anyway?

880
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,711
About a year.

881
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,246
- That long, huh?
- Yeah.

882
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,816
Has she brought up the M-word?

883
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:34,687
Why would
she talk to me about murder?

884
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:38,023
Why would your mind go
right to murder?

885
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:40,059
When you're an attorney,
the M-word is murder.

886
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,129
Okay, yeah.
I was talking about marriage.

887
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,164
Oh, marriage.

888
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,199
Yeah. Well, I've definitely
thought about it.

889
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,734
But she hasn't
brought it up yet.

890
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,937
- Fantastic.
- Huh?

891
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:55,407
That hot rod is fantastic.

892
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,809
Yeah. Yeah.

893
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:59,111
Okay. Yeah.

894
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:00,446
Wow.

895
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,248
So, first holiday
with the family?

896
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:04,116
Yeah, well, technically,

897
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:06,785
I have to go back for
a meeting this afternoon, so,

898
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,921
I'm not sure if I'll be back
in time for dinner tomorrow.

899
00:42:08,954 --> 00:42:11,290
- That's perfect!
- Huh?

900
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:14,226
That paint job
for that year, make, and model.

901
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,694
That's perfect.

902
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:17,363
Okay, cool.

903
00:42:18,264 --> 00:42:20,866
Well, that's too bad
you gotta go, but...

904
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,468
you know,
gotta have your meetings.

905
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,270
Especially this meeting.

906
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:26,138
You know, if things go
the way I think they will,

907
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:29,108
we'll be talking
a lot more about the M-word.

908
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:32,378
The M-word is marriage,
this time, not murder.

909
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,747
- Yeah, I figured that.
- Yeah.

910
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,316
Ooh, now we're talking.

911
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,285
- [whistling]
- That is a beaut.

912
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:41,720
Bryce, isn't this your car?

913
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:45,224
Yeah, I didn't know where to
park, so I just came by here.

914
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,459
Yeah, that's...
Do you want me to pop the hood?

915
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:49,261
- Let's just leave that down.
- Okay.

916
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:54,433
Look, I, for one, am gonna be
incredibly sad to see you go.

917
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:56,202
Ah, you'll be fine without me.

918
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:57,703
Just tell them
one of your jokes.

919
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,005
Keen advice, Esquire.

920
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:02,341
My specialty. And I won't
even charge you for it.

921
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:05,144
Oh, my lucky day.

922
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:07,279
[Samantha]
$300 for a Christmas tree?

923
00:43:07,313 --> 00:43:09,081
That's what I said.

924
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:11,750
Oh, you say that no matter
what something costs,

925
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,319
our home will look classy.

926
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,254
Be quite the presentation.

927
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:17,489
Not $300 classy.

928
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:19,792
Oh, Daddy, you know
this is a useless pursuit.

929
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:21,794
I know. But if I don't protest,

930
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:23,329
then the next thing
you know, it's 500.

931
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:25,164
Did someone summon me
to the kitchen table?

932
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:27,132
Oh yes,
we need you to write down

933
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,901
something
that you're thankful for.

934
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:31,904
Okay.

935
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:35,474
And this can
be anything I want?

936
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:36,875
Yeah.

937
00:43:38,477 --> 00:43:41,013
Just a warning,
it will be read out loud

938
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:42,448
to the whole entire family.

939
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,417
Yeah. Let me get another
one of those, please.

940
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:46,986
Thank you.

941
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:48,387
Oh, what are you guys
doing over here?

942
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:51,190
Hold on...

943
00:43:51,223 --> 00:43:52,524
A little puzzle action.
Watch this.

944
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:55,194
This one will be
a perfect fit there.

945
00:43:55,227 --> 00:43:57,463
This one,
you're gonna want it there.

946
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:59,198
Corners almost done.

947
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,101
Son, we've been working on
this puzzle for over 15 minutes

948
00:44:02,134 --> 00:44:03,836
and we haven't gotten
a single piece to fit.

949
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,272
I'm sorry.

950
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:07,873
No, don't be silly.
We're just...

951
00:44:07,906 --> 00:44:10,109
we're wondering
how you're doing it.

952
00:44:10,142 --> 00:44:12,244
Well, when I was a kid,
my dad used to make me solve

953
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:15,247
a giant puzzle that
was literally a black square

954
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:17,082
before I could go play
with my friends, so.

955
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:19,251
- You're lying.
- Scout's honor.

956
00:44:19,285 --> 00:44:22,254
Hey, fellow scout here. Nice.

957
00:44:22,988 --> 00:44:24,890
Yeah.

958
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:27,192
Charlie quit after Cub Scouts.

959
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:29,461
- [sighing]
- You gotta let that go, Dad.

960
00:44:29,495 --> 00:44:31,864
Well, full disclosure,
I only made it to Tenderfoot.

961
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:35,301
Whoa, Tenderfoot.
That's impressive, huh?

962
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:37,236
That would have been something.

963
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:40,039
I am so sorry
I'm not the perfect son

964
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:42,141
that loves sleeping
in the freezing cold,

965
00:44:42,174 --> 00:44:44,209
and not in this nice,
warm bed, Dad.

966
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:45,811
Is that what you want to hear?

967
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:48,914
That'd be nice. Yes.

968
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:51,617
Actually, for your information,
I went down to Troop 482

969
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,919
and I tried getting back in,
but they said, one,

970
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:56,889
I was way too old and two,
it wouldn't be appropriate.

971
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:03,562
It's what
a Tenderfoot would do.

972
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:08,400
I forgive you.

973
00:45:10,469 --> 00:45:11,870
I love you, Dad.

974
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:18,110
Hey, how about you helping
us out with this puzzle?

975
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,212
Sure, let's do it.

976
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:22,281
No, Luke,
you need to come help us.

977
00:45:22,314 --> 00:45:24,383
Yeah, this one is way harder.

978
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,086
Well, you know what?
I'll sit in the middle.

979
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,054
I'll help everybody.
How's that?

980
00:45:30,556 --> 00:45:33,625
[phone ringing]

981
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,494
Scott.

982
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:36,862
Yeah.

983
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:40,199
Oh, that is fantastic,
thank you for doing that.

984
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,568
Will do, bye.

985
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,371
Was that Scott, your manager?

986
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:48,907
Yeah, he just hired Mrs.
Appletree to be his new secretary.

987
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:50,476
Mrs. Appletree
from the soup kitchen?

988
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:51,977
Yeah, isn't that cool?

989
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,913
Look at you,
changing people's lives.

990
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:57,216
Well, I'm just happy I could
be in a position to help.

991
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,951
Oh, that reminds me.

992
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,487
Any word from
the television producers?

993
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,922
[Luke] Actually, those were
the "fans" that wanted

994
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:06,358
to meet after the show,
and they want to have another

995
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:08,260
meeting about a possible
one hour comedy special

996
00:46:08,293 --> 00:46:10,229
on one of the big
streaming networks,

997
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:11,964
which will probably
turn out to be nothing.

998
00:46:11,997 --> 00:46:13,700
[Samantha] Are you kidding me?

999
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:16,935
First of all thanks for
withholding this exciting news!

1000
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:19,238
And second, they'd be...

1001
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:21,641
crazy not to sign you
to a deal right now.

1002
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:24,309
[John] I agree with Sam.
You got real talent.

1003
00:46:24,343 --> 00:46:28,580
I mean, you could be on
the Jimmy... the show.

1004
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:30,449
- [Linda] The what?
- The Jimmy, you know?

1005
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,484
- I forget his last name.
- Jimmy Kimmel.

1006
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:35,120
- No. No. The funny one.
- Uh, Jimmy... Conan.

1007
00:46:35,154 --> 00:46:37,456
[John] No, no, Jimmy.
Lip sync...

1008
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:39,224
- Jimmy Fallon.
- Fallon. That's it.

1009
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:41,493
You could
be on the Jimmy Fallon.

1010
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,328
You'd be great on Fallon.

1011
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:44,963
Well, thank you,
that means a lot.

1012
00:46:46,331 --> 00:46:49,234
Looks like you both are at
a crossroads in your lives.

1013
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,570
Just like last time.

1014
00:46:54,506 --> 00:46:57,644
I'm going to go get
the Christmas decorations out.

1015
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:11,590
Hey, we just
finished the puzzles.

1016
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,726
- You really missed out.
- Both of them?

1017
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,427
That was supposed
to last all weekend.

1018
00:47:16,428 --> 00:47:17,996
My bad.

1019
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,298
Want some help?

1020
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:21,400
That depends.

1021
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,035
Did your dad blindfold you

1022
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:24,603
and make you decorate
the whole house

1023
00:47:24,637 --> 00:47:26,238
and you're gonna finish
all this in five minutes?

1024
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:28,106
Don't be ridiculous.

1025
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,175
It's going to take me
at least 10. It's a big house.

1026
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,044
[Luke] Thank you.

1027
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:36,582
This is my favorite tradition.

1028
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:38,617
Checking the Christmas lights
for broken bulbs?

1029
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:42,321
No. Decorating for Christmas
Thanksgiving weekend.

1030
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:44,189
Ah yes, much less weird.

1031
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:47,025
How about you?

1032
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:49,361
[Luke] Uh, actually,
this one is kind of weird.

1033
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:51,664
But after Annie got married,
every year, my mom and I

1034
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:54,466
would watch Groundhog Day to
kick off the Christmas season.

1035
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,335
Oh yeah,
I remember you saying that.

1036
00:47:57,704 --> 00:47:59,438
Your mom was the best.

1037
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,077
Yeah, she was.

1038
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:11,718
Luke, I'm sorry, I wasn't
there for you when she passed.

1039
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,619
Sam, you do not
have to apologize.

1040
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:15,387
It was not your obligation.
We'd broken up.

1041
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,322
Yeah,
but I should have been there.

1042
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:21,627
You know, you're right, you are
the worst ex-girlfriend ever.

1043
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:26,799
Remind me,
why Groundhog Day again?

1044
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,701
Uh, it's a classic,

1045
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:30,302
arguably one of the top five

1046
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:31,771
greatest comedy films
of all time.

1047
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:33,706
But it has nothing
to do with Christmas.

1048
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,207
It's a whole different holiday.

1049
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,676
I told you it was weird.

1050
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:40,713
I mean, it is snowing.
I guess that's Christmassy.

1051
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:43,282
Yeah, thanks
for softening the blow.

1052
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:47,119
Who are you gonna
watch it with this year?

1053
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:48,320
Annie?

1054
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:53,625
It's not really her thing.
Plus, I've kind of given it up.

1055
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,394
But it's a tradition.

1056
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:58,831
You've got to
carry on your mom's memory.

1057
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,334
It's kind of hard to explain.

1058
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:07,306
Okay, I get it.

1059
00:49:10,843 --> 00:49:12,679
So how's your big
decision coming along?

1060
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:14,681
- Any progress?
- Ugh, no.

1061
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:16,415
It's like my mind is
rejecting the notion of

1062
00:49:16,448 --> 00:49:18,150
even thinking about it.

1063
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:21,386
Okay, well, maybe I can help.

1064
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:25,157
So what is the
one major argument

1065
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,759
that makes you want
to sell your business?

1066
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:31,196
I guess it's the unknown of

1067
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,298
ever getting an offer
like this again.

1068
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:35,635
And if I sell it at this price,

1069
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:38,537
it really validates me as
a successful businesswoman.

1070
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:40,873
Yeah, but who do
you need validation from?

1071
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:42,574
You're killing it
with your business.

1072
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,610
Anybody who pays
attention can see that.

1073
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:47,346
[Samantha] But I guess there's
always this built-in insecurity

1074
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:50,248
of being
a young female entrepreneur.

1075
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,918
Okay, yeah,
we'll address that in a minute.

1076
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:55,320
All right. What is it you love
most about your business?

1077
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:57,522
I've built this amazing team.

1078
00:49:57,556 --> 00:50:00,459
And creating content
and even getting to see

1079
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:02,194
our customers put on the pieces

1080
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:04,731
and then their whole
countenance changes.

1081
00:50:05,564 --> 00:50:07,199
[sighs]

1082
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:09,501
Sam, you should see
your face right now.

1083
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:12,805
When you talk about
your business, you're glowing.

1084
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:15,875
There's no question
what you need to do,

1085
00:50:16,608 --> 00:50:18,243
turn down the offer.

1086
00:50:18,778 --> 00:50:20,647
You love your business.

1087
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,314
And don't ever
compare yourself to

1088
00:50:22,347 --> 00:50:24,249
any other entrepreneur,
male or female.

1089
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:27,185
You're amazing.
You've always been amazing.

1090
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:28,788
I've always known
you were gonna be a success.

1091
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:32,892
And...

1092
00:50:34,226 --> 00:50:36,395
That's why I had
to get out of your way.

1093
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,238
Anyways...

1094
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:51,376
it's too bad
that Bryce, Esquire,

1095
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,344
had to up
and leave so suddenly.

1096
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:55,882
Yeah, I'm sure you're
really torn up about it.

1097
00:50:55,915 --> 00:50:59,584
I am. Who else is gonna
laugh at all my jokes?

1098
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:00,687
I will.

1099
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:03,923
Once they're funny.

1100
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:07,827
Wow. Okay,
everybody's a comedian now.

1101
00:51:08,895 --> 00:51:10,963
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1102
00:51:16,468 --> 00:51:18,470
What am I doing,
we can't do this.

1103
00:51:18,503 --> 00:51:19,939
[Annie] Ah, come on!

1104
00:51:20,773 --> 00:51:21,908
So close!

1105
00:51:23,308 --> 00:51:25,343
Sam, I'm sorry.

1106
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,747
That wasn't fair to you
or your lawyer friend.

1107
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:30,783
I'm going to bed.

1108
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,455
[sighs]

1109
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:38,691
Capital job, Hudson.

1110
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:42,360
[melodic classical
instrumental]

1111
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:51,603
Hey sis, can I join you?

1112
00:51:51,637 --> 00:51:52,939
[Samantha] Of course.

1113
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:58,376
So uh, almost kissed Luke, huh?

1114
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,013
Wow. That news travelled fast.

1115
00:52:01,047 --> 00:52:02,314
Thank you.

1116
00:52:03,348 --> 00:52:05,051
I was hoping this week
I'd have some clarity

1117
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:07,552
but I'm more
confused than ever.

1118
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,387
Hmm.

1119
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,592
Back in elementary school,
I remember my best friend,

1120
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:17,295
Brian Vorkapich, asking me
which one I loved more:

1121
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:20,432
Thundercats or G.I. Joes.

1122
00:52:20,465 --> 00:52:23,602
Obviously, it was like,
"How dare you ask me to choose

1123
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:24,971
one over the other?
That's blasphemy."

1124
00:52:25,004 --> 00:52:26,672
Yeah.
What kind of friend is that?

1125
00:52:26,706 --> 00:52:28,507
Right?

1126
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,943
But he would not stop
bugging me about it.

1127
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:33,545
So for weeks,
I toiled,

1128
00:52:33,578 --> 00:52:36,448
trying to decide
which one I loved more.

1129
00:52:36,481 --> 00:52:38,316
- Weeks?
- [Charlie] I know, I know,

1130
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,318
it wasn't enough time, but...

1131
00:52:40,352 --> 00:52:42,554
I was under a lot of pressure.

1132
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:44,623
So I took my Thundercat toys.

1133
00:52:44,657 --> 00:52:46,491
Hid them away for a few days.

1134
00:52:46,525 --> 00:52:48,627
And then I did the same thing
with my G.I. Joe toys.

1135
00:52:48,661 --> 00:52:51,463
You know, to see
which one I would miss more.

1136
00:52:52,064 --> 00:52:53,866
And?

1137
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,768
[Charlie] Well,
that was around the same time

1138
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:58,704
Dad bought us a Nintendo, so...

1139
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:00,706
I totally forgot
where I hid them.

1140
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,342
Well, the point is
you have to ask yourself,

1141
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,545
"Would you rather
be stuck with Lady Jaye

1142
00:53:06,578 --> 00:53:07,980
for the rest of your life?

1143
00:53:08,014 --> 00:53:09,081
Or Cheetara?"

1144
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:12,450
I don't know
who either of those people are.

1145
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:16,122
Well, neither is
a bad choice, but...

1146
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:20,358
if I had to go with one,
I'd say...

1147
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:21,459
Cheetara.

1148
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,399
That's what I love
about you, Charlie.

1149
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:29,334
You really know
how to simplify things.

1150
00:53:29,735 --> 00:53:31,037
You're welcome.

1151
00:53:55,427 --> 00:54:01,433
[laughing raucously]

1152
00:54:01,466 --> 00:54:03,903
Oh, Luke Hudson.

1153
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,537
I know him!

1154
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:22,922
- Hey, Dad.
- [loud clattering]

1155
00:54:23,656 --> 00:54:25,423
What'cha doing?

1156
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:27,660
Don't scare me like that.

1157
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:29,862
I know the feeling.

1158
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:33,799
[John] Hey, couldn't sleep?

1159
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,636
Today's the big day.

1160
00:54:36,669 --> 00:54:38,938
Yeah, that's right.
My fried turkey.

1161
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,472
Everybody's pretty excited.

1162
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:42,108
Yes, that is exciting.

1163
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:45,044
But I meant today is the day

1164
00:54:45,077 --> 00:54:46,646
I have to give
the investors my answer.

1165
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:49,749
I mean,
am I going to sell Jovie May?

1166
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:51,549
Right. Right.

1167
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:53,986
Oh, you're asking me?

1168
00:54:55,187 --> 00:54:57,056
Uh, yeah, well, I'm not...
I'm not too sure

1169
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,991
you told me
what you were gonna do.

1170
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,660
Maybe... you know what?
You probably did tell me

1171
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:02,627
and then I don't...
I don't recall. Whoo.

1172
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:04,529
Okay, this is
a little more pressure than

1173
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:06,464
- I was hoping for this early.
- Easy, Dad.

1174
00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:08,466
- Okay.
- I was just thinking out loud.

1175
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,669
Okay.

1176
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,040
So, do you know
what you're gonna do?

1177
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:17,243
I mean,
I know I love my business.

1178
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,078
Every day I go
there and I feel like,

1179
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,813
"This is what I should
be doing with my life."

1180
00:55:22,815 --> 00:55:24,150
Wow.

1181
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:25,517
It seems like
you really love it,

1182
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,953
but you're also torn.

1183
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:30,122
So what's pulling at you from
the other side of the table?

1184
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,760
The last few days
I've really seen

1185
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:37,163
how much I've had to sacrifice
to get to where I am.

1186
00:55:40,266 --> 00:55:41,734
I have regrets.

1187
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:45,570
Let me give you
a piece of advice, sweetie.

1188
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:47,740
By selling your company,

1189
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:50,242
it's not gonna change
anything from the past.

1190
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:52,979
You're still going
to have those regrets.

1191
00:55:53,813 --> 00:55:57,083
But if you really
love something that much?

1192
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,619
Hold on to it... fiercely.

1193
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:10,663
You're a wise man, Dad.

1194
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,765
Thanks.

1195
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:14,599
Maybe somebody
should tell your mother,

1196
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:16,135
that the way wouldn't
have to sneak around a dawn,

1197
00:56:16,168 --> 00:56:17,737
just to fry me up a turkey.

1198
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,972
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, Sam.

1199
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:27,046
All right, ready?

1200
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:30,182
Annie, babe, I love you
but you're going down.

1201
00:56:30,216 --> 00:56:31,784
No, you're going down,
old timer.

1202
00:56:32,118 --> 00:56:33,618
- All right, let's do this...
- Thank you.

1203
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:34,720
Hut.

1204
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:37,990
- Come on!
- [yelling]

1205
00:56:38,024 --> 00:56:39,258
[Annie] Go, go, go, go!

1206
00:56:41,827 --> 00:56:43,829
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

1207
00:56:43,863 --> 00:56:46,766
That's what's up... Oh!

1208
00:56:47,933 --> 00:56:49,635
Why?

1209
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:51,137
Pretty sure
I was in the end zone.

1210
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,537
My bad.

1211
00:56:55,274 --> 00:56:56,809
Come on, everybody, get in.

1212
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:58,644

1381
01:04:39,271 --> 01:04:41,073
Yeah, but if
he's holding the jersey,

1382
01:04:41,106 --> 01:04:42,508
- then that's pass interference.
- Hello, Mr. Banks.

1383
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,109
[John] Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1384
01:04:44,142 --> 01:04:46,044
- Yeah, look at that tie.
- [Bryce] Thanks.

1385
01:04:46,078 --> 01:04:47,613
All right.
So it's third down, right?

1386
01:04:48,347 --> 01:04:49,782
[Grandpa Joe] Here we go. Yeah.

1387
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,617
[Luke]
Feel something good, here.

1388
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:53,218
[announcer] <i>Yes. Yes. Yes, yes.</i>

1389
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,420
- Oh!
- Woo!

1390
01:04:55,454 --> 01:04:57,022
Is this my Cowboys?

1391
01:04:57,657 --> 01:04:59,726
Oh, great. You're back already.

1392
01:04:59,759 --> 01:05:02,662
- No, this is the Lions.
- Oh, you guys are Lions fans?

1393
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:04,831
- [chuckles]
- I pity you.

1394
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:06,198
No.

1395
01:05:07,499 --> 01:05:08,534
I don't get it.

1396
01:05:09,434 --> 01:05:10,737
The Lions just scored.

1397
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,437
But you guys aren't Lions fans.

1398
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:14,106
Exactly.

1399
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:15,407
Then why are
you cheering for the Lions?

1400
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,576
Why is he asking
so many questions?

1401
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,612
Okay, I think
they're watching the parade,

1402
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:22,749
there in the kitchen.

1403
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:25,551
Did you bring me my Twinkies?

1404
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:27,419
Uh...

1405
01:05:27,452 --> 01:05:28,855
Look, we're cheering
for the Lions

1406
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:30,355
because it's Thanksgiving.

1407
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:32,391
You cheer for the Lions.

1408
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:34,393
But what if you
don't like the Lions?

1409
01:05:34,426 --> 01:05:36,729
You're missing the point?
I mean, it's Thanksgiving.

1410
01:05:36,763 --> 01:05:39,666
You cheer for the Lions. It's
just... It's just what you do.

1411
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:42,234
Oh, okay. Okay,
I got it. I got it.

1412
01:05:42,267 --> 01:05:44,069
Okay, yeah, I get it.

1413
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,709
It's just that
they lose every year, though.

1414
01:05:49,742 --> 01:05:51,844
- He still doesn't get it.
- Not a lick.

1415
01:05:51,878 --> 01:05:53,478
Not a lick.

1416
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:55,547
Sam, your friend is here.

1417
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:57,717
If Whizzer White
was playing here,

1418
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,852
we'd be winning
that turkey leg.

1419
01:05:59,886 --> 01:06:01,320
[Luke, John and Charlie]
We know...

1420
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:03,756
Whizzer White.
I know that name.

1421
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,291
He's infamous for one of
the worst plays

1422
01:06:06,325 --> 01:06:08,193
in NFL history, right?

1423
01:06:10,162 --> 01:06:12,230
What did you say?

1424
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,767
Yeah. Didn't he, like,
run back 50 yards

1425
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:17,369
to get away from the defense
and then fumble the ball

1426
01:06:17,402 --> 01:06:19,171
into the other team's end zone?

1427
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:20,707
- [chuckling]
- [Grandpa Joe] That's it!

1428
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:22,909
[Charlie] Oh, come on, man.

1429
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:24,811
What are you doing?
I gave you all the signs.

1430
01:06:24,844 --> 01:06:26,813
So much for watching the game.

1431
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,448
Please don't hurt me, sir.

1432
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,418
You know,
sometimes you've got to give

1433
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:37,389
an ignorant, young kid
a history lesson.

1434
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:42,561
Whizzer White was a magician
on the football field,

1435
01:06:42,594 --> 01:06:44,664
he could do things
that would make the...

1436
01:06:44,697 --> 01:06:47,934
hair on your back tingle.

1437
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:49,869
Did you say something bad
about Whizzer White?

1438
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:52,939
- [grunts]
- That's a big no, no.

1439
01:06:52,972 --> 01:06:55,507
He's my grandpa's
childhood hero.

1440
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:56,909
How was I supposed to know?

1441
01:06:58,343 --> 01:07:00,579
Did anything exciting happen
while I was gone?

1442
01:07:00,612 --> 01:07:02,649
Oh, the Lions are up.

1443
01:07:02,682 --> 01:07:04,416
- Nice.
- You too?

1444
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:05,918
I mean, you got to cheer
for the Lions.

1445
01:07:05,952 --> 01:07:07,854
- It's Thanksgiving.
- Apparently.

1446
01:07:07,887 --> 01:07:09,588
Okay. Good luck with
the Whizzer trivia.

1447
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:11,323
He's probably gonna test ya.

1448
01:07:11,356 --> 01:07:13,960
And he was forced
to go backwards 40 yards.

1449
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,161
Not 50, like you said.

1450
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:18,530
And I'll tell you what.

1451
01:07:18,563 --> 01:07:23,301
This is something no one wants
to talk about, except me.

1452
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:26,471
That ball was greased.

1453
01:07:26,505 --> 01:07:27,640
Here we go.

1454
01:07:27,674 --> 01:07:29,508
Somebody on the defensive line

1455
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:32,611
greased that ball
before that play.

1456
01:07:32,645 --> 01:07:34,246
And they could do that
in those days.

1457
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:35,782
And, I'll tell you why.

1458
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:37,984
Because they didn't
have those fancy cameras

1459
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:39,652
they've got today.

1460
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:42,587
Okay, it's time to
get ready for dinner!

1461
01:07:42,621 --> 01:07:43,790
- Hallelujah.
- Wait a minute.

1462
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:45,557
I'm not done yet.

1463
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,894
Sorry, grandpa, don't want
to disappoint the women.

1464
01:07:48,828 --> 01:07:50,663
Oh, well, all right.

1465
01:07:50,697 --> 01:07:52,297
I can start over
and we can, uh,

1466
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,666
cover the whole thing
for the ladies.

1467
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,668
They need to hear this, too.

1468
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:59,237
Hey, guys, thanks for letting
me sit at the cool table.

1469
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:00,673
I was worried
I'd be stuck with those old,

1470
01:08:00,707 --> 01:08:01,908
boring people over there.

1471
01:08:01,941 --> 01:08:03,743
No problem.

1472
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:05,812
You want me to invite Samantha
to come sit with us?

1473
01:08:05,845 --> 01:08:07,680
Don't be so juvenile. Besides,

1474
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:10,248
she has to sit next to
her lawyer friend.

1475
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:11,951
Should I punch him again?

1476
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:14,553
Yeah, we need some more footage
for our YouTube channel.

1477
01:08:14,586 --> 01:08:17,990
Luke. We have a seat
for you at the adult table.

1478
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:19,926
Oh, that's fine. I don't
mind hanging with my buds.

1479
01:08:19,959 --> 01:08:21,661
No, don't be silly. Come on.

1480
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,596
Sorry, guys, don't want to
get in trouble with the boss.

1481
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:28,768
Ooh, baby, come to mama.

1482
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:33,973
- Somebody order a turkey?
- [Samantha] Woah-ho-ho!

1483
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:36,809
[exclaiming]

1484
01:08:36,843 --> 01:08:41,480
Uh, before we start on
this delicious meal,

1485
01:08:41,513 --> 01:08:43,716
as per Banks family tradition,

1486
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,752
we have asked you to
write down something on

1487
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:47,619
a piece of paper
that you're thankful for.

1488
01:08:47,653 --> 01:08:49,454
And I have all those
responses here in the jar.

1489
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:51,323
I'm gonna
read them off one by one.

1490
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:54,559
And then you have to guess
who wrote them. All right?

1491
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:57,063
- Let's get to the food.
- I know we're going to eat.

1492
01:08:57,096 --> 01:08:59,899
Don't worry, Charlie.
All right, first one.

1493
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:03,069
"I am thankful for... Whizzer."

1494
01:09:03,102 --> 01:09:05,437
Oh, Dad.

1495
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:06,538
What?

1496
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:08,607
That can be anybody.

1497
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:10,843
I gave a very
compelling argument

1498
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:12,779
about that just
a few minutes ago.

1499
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:15,014
[John] All right, next one.

1500
01:09:15,047 --> 01:09:18,383
"I am thankful for low
carbon emission vehicles,

1501
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:22,655
lawsuits, work out polos
and gluten free cookies."

1502
01:09:22,688 --> 01:09:24,556
Awesome.

1503
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:26,092
Literally hate every single
one of those things.

1504
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,693
If I would
have been here for this,

1505
01:09:27,727 --> 01:09:29,561
that would have been mine.

1506
01:09:29,594 --> 01:09:31,664
I went ahead and filled
that one out for you, buddy.

1507
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:33,298
You get me, bro.

1508
01:09:36,102 --> 01:09:38,771
- [John] Okay.
- "Samantha."

1509
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:40,472
Yeah.

1510
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,976
No, it actually it
just says, "Samantha."

1511
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:48,714
Oh, well, I guess someone
is thankful for Samantha.

1512
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:52,551
Uh, actually, that's what
I would have put down, right?

1513
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,086
I think it was Luke.

1514
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,122
- Definitely Luke.
- Are you serious?

1515
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:57,657
Why would you think
it was Luke?

1516
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,424
Uh... What?

1517
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:01,060
Yeah, Charlie, why
would you think it was Luke?

1518
01:10:01,093 --> 01:10:02,728
Don't look at me.

1519
01:10:04,596 --> 01:10:06,098
That was mine.

1520
01:10:06,132 --> 01:10:08,701
I just look up to you so much,
Aunt Samantha.

1521
01:10:08,734 --> 01:10:11,570
[Linda] Aww. She's so good.

1522
01:10:11,603 --> 01:10:13,873
[cooing and murmuring]

1523
01:10:13,906 --> 01:10:15,675
[Samantha] You are so sweet.

1524
01:10:16,408 --> 01:10:18,911
- [Peyton] You're the best Aunt.
- You're the best niece.

1525
01:10:18,945 --> 01:10:22,982
I love you so much.
Uh, maybe we should eat, dad.

1526
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,819
Okay, but seriously,
why did you think it was Luke?

1527
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:30,656
Yeah. Charlie,
what were you thinking?

1528
01:10:31,724 --> 01:10:34,026
I'm sorry. That's sweet.

1529
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,427
Okay.

1530
01:10:36,662 --> 01:10:40,465
Everyone, I just want to say
how thankful I am to the Lord

1531
01:10:40,498 --> 01:10:42,802
that the people
that I love most

1532
01:10:42,835 --> 01:10:45,004
are here with us
to celebrate Thanksgiving.

1533
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:47,907
We are truly a blessed family.

1534
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,809
We have so much
to be thankful for.

1535
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:51,576
Here, here.

1536
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:52,945
- Here, here.
- [Annie] Woo!

1537
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:54,747
[John] Cheers.

1538
01:10:55,982 --> 01:10:58,383
Okay, let's say grace.

1539
01:11:01,453 --> 01:11:02,922
Dear Lord, in heaven.

1540
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:04,891
Thank you for this
wonderful bounty

1541
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:06,792
and the many blessings
you have given us.

1542
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:09,729
We are so thankful
to be together as a family.

1543
01:11:09,762 --> 01:11:11,697
In Jesus name. Amen.

1544
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:13,132
[all] Amen.

1545
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,637
[John] All right, now...

1546
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,738
Let's eat!

1547
01:11:18,771 --> 01:11:20,306
[Linda] Yeah!

1548
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:27,847
- I want your pie.
- Dessert is later, dad.

1549
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:30,950
- Yeah, that's what I want.
- This is the salad plate, hun.

1550
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:32,685
Oh, sorry.

1551
01:11:32,718 --> 01:11:36,956
Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
One, one more of those.

1552
01:11:36,989 --> 01:11:39,624
And then he runs back.
He runs all the way around...

1553
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:42,795
- [Bryce] Oh, yes.
- [Charlie] Whoa.

1554
01:11:42,828 --> 01:11:44,797
Whoo, slippery.

1555
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:48,234
Oh, you have to try
some on my mom's rolls.

1556
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:50,703
They are melt in your mouth,
like butter good.

1557
01:11:50,736 --> 01:11:53,806
Honey. You know
I'm not eating any carbs.

1558
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:55,507
Not even on Thanksgiving?

1559
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,810
[Luke] Fantastic.
That means more for me.

1560
01:11:59,577 --> 01:12:02,648
Mm. Linda, have I just died
and gone to heaven?

1561
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:04,549
These rolls are amazing.

1562
01:12:04,582 --> 01:12:06,118
You know, if things
don't work out with John,

1563
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:07,619
- I'm still single.
- Oh, Luke,

1564
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:09,989
you're gonna make me blush.

1565
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:11,657
Luke, are
you hitting on my mom?

1566
01:12:11,691 --> 01:12:13,558
[Luke] Absolutely.
Have you tried the rolls?

1567
01:12:14,193 --> 01:12:16,796
Fair point. Hey.
Can you pass those down.

1568
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:19,131
So, Bryce, is your family
together for Thanksgiving?

1569
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:21,167
Um...

1570
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,102
Actually, I don't know.

1571
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:25,004
It's been a while since
we had a Thanksgiving together.

1572
01:12:25,037 --> 01:12:26,672
Do you not like your family?

1573
01:12:26,706 --> 01:12:29,574
- [Samantha] Charlie?
- No, it's fine.

1574
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:32,878
We're a family full of lawyers,
so you can imagine.

1575
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:34,747
[Linda]
That's enough gravy, Dad.

1576
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,215
You know what the doctor said.

1577
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:39,085
If I can't enjoy
a good meal at Thanksgiving,

1578
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:41,619
what's the point
in being alive?

1579
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:44,890
If I drop dead
eating this delicious meal,

1580
01:12:44,924 --> 01:12:46,892
I'll die a happy man.

1581
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:49,561
Fine. Have it your way.

1582
01:12:49,594 --> 01:12:51,197
- Really?
- No, not really.

1583
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:53,866
- Give me the gravy.
- So, I saw in the news

1584
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:55,668
that people are already, like,

1585
01:12:55,701 --> 01:12:57,803
lining way out the door
for Black Friday sales.

1586
01:12:57,837 --> 01:13:00,906
What? Black Friday
now moved to Thursday?

1587
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,607
Come on.

1588
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:04,677
How about a little
respect for the holiday?

1589
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,712
You know, I wish they would get
rid of Black Friday altogether.

1590
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:08,280
I mean, there's no
discount in the world

1591
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:10,116
worth being around
all those crazy people.

1592
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:11,684
Yes. Seriously.
Who shops anymore?

1593
01:13:11,717 --> 01:13:13,551
I buy everything online.

1594
01:13:14,086 --> 01:13:16,655
Look, we're talking
about actual real shopping.

1595
01:13:16,689 --> 01:13:18,523
Not Magic: The Gathering cards.

1596
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:21,894
You are so hot right now,
say it again.

1597
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:24,997
Magic: The Gathering cards.

1598
01:13:25,031 --> 01:13:27,199
- Oh, boy.
- You guys are so cute.

1599
01:13:27,233 --> 01:13:29,735
[Linda] Listen,
I'm a shopper who loves

1600
01:13:29,769 --> 01:13:31,837
a good sale as much as anyone.

1601
01:13:31,871 --> 01:13:34,073
But I have to agree
with Luke on this.

1602
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:36,642
Why can't families
just spend time together?

1603
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:38,344
You know,
enjoy the autumn leaves.

1604
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:41,147
[Grandpa Joe] Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely. Right.

1605
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:44,717
[Annie] Can you hand me a bowl?

1606
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:55,327
[slow, classical instrumental]

1607
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:08,007
[Charlie] Hey, man,
everything okay?

1608
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,009
Oh, yeah.

1609
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:11,911
Really? Because you...

1610
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:14,113
looked like
a miserable cuss back here.

1611
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:15,915
I dunno.
You ever feel like maybe

1612
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:17,950
you missed
your chance on something?

1613
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,820
[Charlie] Why?
Do you miss something?

1614
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:22,388
I don't know. I just feel like

1615
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,957
maybe my time with Samantha
might have passed.

1616
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,026
And should have made
different decisions.

1617
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:32,064
You know, back when
Annie and I were dating,

1618
01:14:33,032 --> 01:14:35,334
we came to a crossroads
in our relationship.

1619
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:37,870
We were this
close to parting ways.

1620
01:14:37,903 --> 01:14:39,305
What happened?

1621
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:41,040
Well, as you may know,

1622
01:14:41,073 --> 01:14:45,344
I'm a huge fan of
the original Star Wars saga...

1623
01:14:45,377 --> 01:14:47,947
but Annie likes
the prequels better.

1624
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,815
That's right. Ouch.

1625
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:51,851
Yeah, seriously, I know.

1626
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:55,421
So naturally, I had to wonder,
"Could I be with someone who

1627
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:58,757
thinks so differently from me
on something so important?"

1628
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,393
Yeah. What'd you end up doing?

1629
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:06,265
Well, in the end, I looked
at her and thought to myself,

1630
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:09,101
"Man, she is smoking hot,
super smart,

1631
01:15:09,135 --> 01:15:12,138
and,
for some odd reason, into me,"

1632
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:14,740
I didn't want
to screw that up, so...

1633
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:16,242
I proposed to her the next day.

1634
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:17,676
The rest is history.

1635
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:21,180
Plus, we both
equally hate the new films.

1636
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:26,118
Well, thank you for
sharing that story with me.

1637
01:15:26,152 --> 01:15:28,087
It was
an entertaining anecdote.

1638
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,823
I'm not exactly sure how it
applies to my situation, but,

1639
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:33,058
something I did
not know about my sister.

1640
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:34,760
No problem.

1641
01:15:34,793 --> 01:15:37,730
But seriously, like,
I can't speak for Sam

1642
01:15:37,763 --> 01:15:40,900
but I can tell you what I see...
Or what I don't see,

1643
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:43,369
which is an engagement
ring on her finger.

1644
01:15:45,137 --> 01:15:48,274
So there might be
a little bit of tim...

1645
01:15:50,276 --> 01:15:52,978
Oh, Ooh. Ooh, scratch that.

1646
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:55,915
[groans]

1647
01:15:55,948 --> 01:15:57,149
Good luck with that.

1648
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,151
I'm gonna go congratulate her.

1649
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:01,120
I'll try to... No, sorry.

1650
01:16:04,423 --> 01:16:06,725
- [chuckles]
- What's goin' on?

1651
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,429
[sighs]

1652
01:16:10,462 --> 01:16:12,364
Woah, when did you get here?

1653
01:16:13,165 --> 01:16:14,900
Don't worry about that.

1654
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:18,904
Ah, that'll never stick.

1655
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,243
She's not in love with him. I
can tell by looking in her eyes.

1656
01:16:24,276 --> 01:16:26,345
You think?

1657
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:27,846
Yeah.

1658
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,116
That's the funny
thing about love.

1659
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,986
You know, sometimes,

1660
01:16:34,019 --> 01:16:36,422
everybody else knows but you.

1661
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:40,793
She just needs a little nudge.
That's all.

1662
01:16:41,527 --> 01:16:43,195
Thank you, Grandpa Joe.

1663
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:44,863
Remind me
I owe you a cookie, okay?

1664
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:47,366
Okay.

1665
01:16:47,866 --> 01:16:53,305
Now what I need from you
is a big distraction...

1666
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:54,773
Pie time.

1667
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:13,259
Ugh, this looks delicious.

1668
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,995
Good job, hon.

1669
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:17,997
- [Linda] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1670
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,865
Bryce Jones, Esquire.

1671
01:17:20,499 --> 01:17:23,168
Oh. Mm hmm.
I need to take this.

1672
01:17:24,236 --> 01:17:25,871
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1673
01:17:25,904 --> 01:17:28,240
Oh, hey,
did you hear I'm engaged?

1674
01:17:28,274 --> 01:17:30,009
Yeah, I know.

1675
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,211
Hey, best man?

1676
01:17:32,244 --> 01:17:34,146
That would be something.

1677
01:17:40,386 --> 01:17:44,089
So I uh, just wanted
to say congratulations.

1678
01:17:45,424 --> 01:17:47,092
That seemed to
come out of the blue.

1679
01:17:48,027 --> 01:17:50,162
Were you surprised?

1680
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:52,831
- You could say that.
- Yeah...

1681
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:56,835
Me too.

1682
01:17:58,137 --> 01:18:00,472
All right, so the money is out
of escrow and into the account?

1683
01:18:00,506 --> 01:18:03,509
Perfect. Yes, that is exactly
what I needed to hear.

1684
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,277
All right.
You're the best, man.

1685
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,879
We'll talk soon. Okay, bye.

1686
01:18:17,423 --> 01:18:19,458
[Bryce clears throat]

1687
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,895
Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

1688
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:24,363
[John] Yup.
We know you're engaged.

1689
01:18:24,396 --> 01:18:26,432
Come on in. Get some pie.

1690
01:18:26,465 --> 01:18:29,234
It's not that. Samantha.

1691
01:18:29,268 --> 01:18:31,904
The meeting
I had to go to yesterday

1692
01:18:31,937 --> 01:18:34,073
was actually
with the investors.

1693
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:37,376
And I know you were
super torn on what to do, so...

1694
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,579
I went and negotiated
on your behalf.

1695
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:44,583
And I'm super excited to say
that I was able to negotiate

1696
01:18:44,616 --> 01:18:48,220
an additional 10%
on top of the initial offer.

1697
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:50,189
And I just
confirmed that the money

1698
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:52,524
- is in your account.
- [chuckles]

1699
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:59,865
[staggered clapping]

1700
01:19:02,368 --> 01:19:04,970
Samantha Jones, Esquire,
everyone.

1701
01:19:11,678 --> 01:19:12,544
Wow.

1702
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,484
Guess she couldn't
contain her excitement.

1703
01:19:20,085 --> 01:19:21,887
Try again, Esquire.

1704
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:24,256
You had no right to do that.

1705
01:19:28,293 --> 01:19:30,162
[sighs]

1706
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,435
Shortest engagement ever.

1707
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:38,370
Charlie. Bad.

1708
01:19:38,404 --> 01:19:41,140
You think just because
I gave you power of attorney,

1709
01:19:41,173 --> 01:19:42,675
that you could make
this decision

1710
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:44,109
- without even consulting me?
- Well, frankly,

1711
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:45,678
I thought you'd be relieved.

1712
01:19:45,712 --> 01:19:47,312
You know, I could tell
you wanted the decision

1713
01:19:47,346 --> 01:19:49,415
taken out of your hands
and made for you.

1714
01:19:49,448 --> 01:19:52,685
And I thought
an additional $1.5 million

1715
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,420
would help ease your concerns.

1716
01:19:54,453 --> 01:19:56,355
- So, yeah.
- It was my decision.

1717
01:19:56,388 --> 01:19:59,124
And I'm not selling Jovie May.
I'm keeping my business.

1718
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:00,693
Well, that's going
to be a problem
