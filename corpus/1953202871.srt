00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,026
[singing]

2
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,035
[gunshot]

3
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,266
Okay, okay, okay.
No problem, no problem.

4
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,018
Easy.
Put those guns away.

5
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,562
No problems.
No problems.

6
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,774
Okay, good, good.
Okay.

7
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,820
Anything you want.

8
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,162
What is it you want?
Please tell me.

9
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,665
You're right.
Have it.

10
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,959
Take it, take it.
It's okay, it's okay.

11
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:02,409
Okay, you want this?
Okay.

12
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,134
(female) Did you put numbers on these?

13
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,762
Um, I kind of forgot.

14
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,414
(female) These are going into
storage for a very long time.

15
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,936
We'll never remember
what's in them without a system.

16
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,437
You'll thank me later.

17
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,064
[door bell rings]

18
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,565
Who's here?

19
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,617
(female) The Bacardis
are bringing us dinner.

20
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,744
Oh, good.

21
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,812
Maybe Steve brought that
5 bucks he owes me.

22
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,239
(female) Funny.

23
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,781
[laughing]

24
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,033
Oh, all right.
Fine, no problem.

25
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,444
But you know what, we're
really excited for you guys.

26
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,662
Kind of jealous, you know?

27
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,455
Wish we could just, what, pick up,

28
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
go off on a new adventure.

29
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,351
Then again, you know how it is,

30
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,852
you got a house and you got pets

31
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,462
and you got kids and you got...

32
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,316
(Mrs. Bacardi) Well, tell us anyways
all about what you're gonna

33
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,676
be doing there.

34
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,477
Well, for the first couple of months,

35
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:46,163
we'll be traveling with a mobile clinic,

36
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,349
practicing basic healthcare,
disease prevention.

37
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,242
I'm gonna be part of the surgical team,

38
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,937
and Kim will do all of the
general health screenings.

39
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,189
After that, we plan to
start a clinic of our own

40
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
in one of the locations.

41
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,901
It's gonna be awesome.
I'm so excited.

42
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,111
Yeah.

43
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,617
(Mrs. Bacardi) Hey, are
you okay, sweetie?

44
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,495
Yeah, you know, there's just so much to do,

45
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,873
it's overwhelming.

46
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,125
I have something for you.

47
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,212
I know how Paul feels about it,
but it's not for him.

48
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,923
It was the one I used a lot last year

49
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,717
after my mom passed away,

50
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,261
and I have marked a lot of Scripture.

51
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,637
I just thought...

52
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,514
Thank you, Michelle.

53
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,183
It really was comforting for me.

54
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,186
Honey, I can't find the permanent markers.

55
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,563
On the table.

56
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,153
Thank you.

57
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,480
Should we be going so soon?

58
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:24,277
It wasn't a rash decision.

59
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,845
We thought this thing through,

60
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:27,989
we're qualified,

61
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,201
and it's a good thing to do.

62
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:38,333
Should we send this to storage?

63
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,293
The Hope Center needs one.

64
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,171
They're sending someone over to pick it up.

65
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,633
If we ever need another one, we'll buy one.

66
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:55,183
Hey, you remember when
we first got married?

67
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,977
How we wanted to be trailblazers?

68
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,271
We were gonna travel the world,

69
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,192
but it wasn't a couple of years
and that was all forgotten.

70
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,403
We became clock-punchers.

71
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,030
Parents?

72
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,808
(Paul) Listen, tomorrow morning
we're gonna get on that plane

73
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,827
and we're gonna forget
about this place forever.

74
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,595
We're gonna start a brand new life.

75
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,872
We're gonna travel.
We're gonna help people.

76
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,084
Everything's gonna be new, including us.

77
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,590
What if it doesn't work?

78
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,010
I love you.

79
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,639
Do you trust me?

80
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,850
I love you, too.

81
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,287
Okay.

82
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,388
It's a book.

83
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,056
Everybody reads books on planes.

84
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,517
Hey, as long as it makes you happy.

85
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,352
Just don't go falling down the rabbit hole.

86
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,251
Definitely some French influence here.

87
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,628
Yeah.

88
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,552
It's not bad, eh?

89
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,809
Excuse me, could you...

90
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,227
Could you take our picture?

91
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,594
...Take a picture for me?

92
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,230
Thank you.

93
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,613
- Really?
- Come on.

94
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,369
What do you think?

95
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,579
You see?
You're gonna fit right in.

96
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,833
What do you think?

97
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,876
Huh? No?

98
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,586
Come on!

99
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,049
I'd like one of these for work, huh?

100
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,093
We should bring one.

101
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,263
When we open up our first clinic,

102
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,730
it'll be like the ambulance.

103
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:40,942
We'll have a bed on the back.

104
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,559
That's excellent.

105
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,906
Are you glad we came?

106
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,742
Yes, this is paradise.

107
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,269
This is it.

108
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,105
(Paul) Wow, now we know why they need help.

109
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,066
(Kim) Do I do the bowing
thing first, or do they?

110
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,652
Just bow to everybody
and you'll be covered.

111
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,492
(male) Doctors Jordan!

112
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,537
Dr. Kiet,
nice to meet you.

113
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,080
You guys ready to start?

114
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,582
We have a very busy day today.

115
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,750
I think so.

116
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,168
Take your bags in the back;

117
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,969
There's a room with your name on it.

118
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,555
And then a quick tour.
Come on.

119
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,132
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, let's do it.

120
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,899
(Dr. Kiet) Triage,
everyone starts here.

121
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,653
Then either to emergency,
the ward, or to surgery.

122
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,304
(Kim) Paul, I'm gonna need your help here!

123
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,852
Test the vitals.

124
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,846
[shushing] Just relax.
Just relax. Just relax.

125
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,023
Just relax.

126
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,545
Do you speak English?

127
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,505
What happened?

128
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,826
Paul?

129
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,165
Paul?

130
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,625
Yeah?

131
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,835
This is not paradise.

132
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,154
I can't believe some of this
equipment is older than we are.

133
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,366
Yeah, it's amazing what
they have to work with.

134
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,457
What?
What's the matter?

135
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,925
(Kim)
We should find Dr. Kiet.

136
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:19,637
No, he left to fill up the water tanks.

137
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,795
What's the matter?

138
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,755
Please, help my...
she... her baby.

139
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,923
Your mother?

140
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,441
Please, please help my mother.

141
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,218
Okay, show me where she's at, okay?

142
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,370
Look, I'm sure this is
nothing I can't handle.

143
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:30,498
I'm gonna go check it out.

144
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,639
We don't open for

145
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,057
Do you need me?

146
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,475
No, Dr. Kiet
needs you, okay?

147
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,943
Tell him I'll be right back.

148
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:39,865
You should take someone with
you, a translator, Paul. Paul?

149
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,780
Wait! Hey!

150
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,948
Hey, hey!

151
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,159
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

152
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,246
Wait! Hey!

153
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,248
Can you tell... can
you tell me more?

154
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,833
Where are we going?

155
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,460
Hey!

156
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,553
You've gotta be kidding me.

157
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,763
Where'd he go?
Kid?

158
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,892
Kid?!

159
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,152
I take it neither of you are pregnant.

160
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,867
Okay.

161
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,078
Okay look, there must be
some kind of mistake.

162
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,082
I'm an American, okay?

163
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,044
If you want some money or...
I have nothing on me.

164
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,256
If you want... if you want
drugs, they're at the clinic.

165
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,466
I'm in a marriage. it's...

166
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,505
Any word from him?

167
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,591
He's not answering his phone.

168
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,126
If it was complicated, he
would have sent for an assist.

169
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,846
If it wasn't, he'd be back by now.

170
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,973
You don't think he should have gone?

171
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,100
I understand he wants to help people.

172
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,052
But I think if he wants to help people,

173
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,855
he should do it here with our team.

174
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,650
Maybe the boy lives
farther than he indicated.

175
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,118
We should get back to work.

176
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,788
Your husband will show up.

177
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,530
Most likely he helped the one lady

178
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:39,035
and now her house has turned
into his own personal hospital.

179
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,621
Your husband will show up.

180
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,792
Move!

181
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,481
That kick to the knee may
have fractured your kneecap.

182
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,025
You should have a doctor look at it.

183
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,443
You funny.

184
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,861
Yeah.

185
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,238
That's free of charge.

186
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,733
This is island.

187
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,861
You run, we find you,

188
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,072
or snake find you first, ha ha.

189
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,987
His pulse is racing.

190
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,114
Here, uncuff me.

191
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,326
You want me to help
him, right? Uncuff me!

192
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,080
What happened to his leg?

193
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,083
I know you can understand me.
What happened to his leg?

194
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,587
His leg, a bullet.

195
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,798
There's a bullet in there now?

196
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,385
Okay.

197
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
Look, I need my trauma kit.

198
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,639
My medical bag.
I need it

199
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,305
Do you have any medication at all?

200
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,942
Any antibiotics, painkillers, anything?

201
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,570
Look, this bullet's gotta
come out of here now.

202
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,031
There's a ton of dead tissue here.

203
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,116
How long ago did it happen?

204
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,160
Three night.

205
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,704
Three nights?

206
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm afraid he's septic.

207
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,999
He's our captain.

208
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,209
Help him.

209
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,661
Your captain's gonna die
if I don't get my medical kit

210
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,673
and a nice, sharp knife.
Do you understand me?

211
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,778
(Kim) I'm looking for this man.

212
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,181
His name's... yeah?

213
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,673
Thank you.

214
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,009
Hi, hi, hi.

215
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,385
Please?

216
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,513
Hi.

217
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,099
Hi, I'm looking for this man.

218
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,475
Please?

219
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,271
Hi.

220
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,481
Will you please take this?

221
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:44,256
Hi. excuse me.
Have you seen him?

222
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,304
Hi, excuse me...

223
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,931
Hey!

224
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,230
Stop!

225
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,857
Stop him!

226
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,315
Do you know where my husband is?!

227
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,283
Where's my husband?!

228
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,035
You know where my husband is!

229
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,411
Ow!

230
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,128
Grab that kid!

231
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,089
He knows where my husband is!

232
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,465
Grab that kid!

233
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,916
Do you want some tea?

234
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,127
Oh, no thank you.

235
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,713
I don't need anything else
that'll make me...

236
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,467
When you speak with the inspector,

237
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,678
don't let them see that.

238
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,019
What happened?

239
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,354
My husband's missing.

240
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:27,568
A young boy needed help,
and he went with him.

241
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,612
I haven't seen him in over 8 hours,

242
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:36,827
but I saw the boy with his bag, empty.

243
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,388
I just prayed for you to find your husband.

244
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,348
Thank you.

245
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,477
(male ♪2) Next.

246
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,237
This is all you brought me?

247
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,865
No syringe?

248
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,868
Come on, I know one of you
shady characters has a syringe.

249
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,079
I need one to irrigate his wound.

250
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,227
Look, I'm gonna do this for you, okay?

251
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,229
Do you really need to point that gun at me?

252
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,799
You will tell me everything,
or I bring it out again.

253
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,217
Okay.

254
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,428
I'm gonna clean his wound
with this, all right?

255
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,388
Captain want to drink.

256
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,599
Look, I don't recommend that.
Dehydration.

257
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,448
Okay, the good news is he'll probably

258
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,819
pass out from the pain.

259
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,770
Look, I have to cut away the dead tissue

260
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,372
and then I'm gonna remove the bullet,

261
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:57,683
but it's gonna really hurt so
I need you to hold him down,

262
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,201
and I mean hold him down.

263
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,455
You ready?

264
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,623
Let's do it.

265
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:10,504
[screaming]

266
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,922
Hold him!

267
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,925
[screaming continues]

268
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,902
(Kim) My husband has been missing all day.

269
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,304
I should have come to
you first and reported it,

270
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,640
but I kept thinking
he'd be back any minute.

271
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,158
How long has he been missing?

272
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,269
Since this morning, around 8.

273
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,191
There are many things
American men like to do

274
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,359
here in Thailand.

275
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,777
Amusement.

276
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,279
He may return this evening
smelling with a strong scent

277
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,406
of Singha on his breath.

278
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,033
No, he isn't like that.

279
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,119
We're here on business.

280
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,370
Okay.

281
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,290
If you insist, you may file
a missing person report

282
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,641
and contact your Embassy.

283
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,019
And if there's no evidence
of an accident or a crime,

284
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:51,995
we're under the assumption that he's fine

285
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,297
and may not want to be found.

286
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,965
Sir, there is evidence.

287
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,550
We work at the medical clinic.

288
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,261
The boy I was chasing came
into the medical clinic

289
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,097
saying his mother was
in need of medical help,

290
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,308
that his mother was in labor.

291
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,061
Your husband's a doctor?

292
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,856
(Kim) We're both doctors.

293
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,649
And I found the bag on the boy.

294
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,075
What?

295
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,122
The driver, he recognized
the boy you were chasing.

296
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,791
He's a street boy that
travel town between coves.

297
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,294
I've run into him many times before.

298
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,505
But the boy, he has no mother.

299
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,762
Do you know where to find him?

300
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,722
Find out why he did this.

301
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,140
Of course.

302
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,893
We do all that we can.
We will try to find the boy.

303
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,729
You're gonna need to fill out some forms.

304
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,754
(Paul) Look, I had to cut
away the dead tissue

305
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,447
and then take out the bullet.

306
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,617
You didn't close it.

307
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,118
No.

308
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,020
This kind of wound you pack with gauze

309
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,631
so it can soak up the pus and the ﬂuids.

310
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,499
It's the only way you can remove it.

311
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,542
It heals from the inside out.

312
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,294
If I close it with bacteria inside,

313
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,380
we're gonna have some serious problems.

314
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,747
But it's okay.
It's simple.

315
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>I'll</i> teach you how to do it,
and you can repack it yourself...

316
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,511
You will do it.

317
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,307
You're gonna take me home tonight.

318
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,475
I'll still help you.

319
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,853
I'll get you medication from
the clinic, antibiotics;

320
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,231
Otherwise, it's just
gonna fester for a week

321
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,332
and his vital organs
will start shutting down,

322
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,511
his kidneys, his lungs,
and eventually heart failure.

323
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,988
You're gonna end up with a dead captain.

324
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,783
You keep him alive.

325
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,995
You will finish the job.

326
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,298
Excuse me, wait.

327
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,182
I wanted to say thanks for the advice.

328
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:03,144
I think he's gonna help.

329
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,636
You're welcome.

330
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,139
What do you do here
besides educate foreigners?

331
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,016
Oh, I don't work here.

332
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,852
Oh, I'm sorry.

333
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,770
It seemed like you belonged here.

334
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,524
Oh, I came here a lot over the last week.

335
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,984
That's all.

336
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,194
I hope everything's okay.

337
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,742
My husband also missing.

338
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,160
A ransom was demanded;

339
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:32,706
We haven't heard anything
from them since then.

340
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,333
Well, you're very calm.

341
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,084
If I'm still here in several days,

342
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:37,252
my jai yang will not be.

343
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,757
It peace that passeth understanding.

344
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,342
I'm Kim.

345
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,760
Somsri.

346
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,720
Thank you, Somsri.

347
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,764
Your husband will be fine.

348
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,849
I have faith.

349
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,476
Thank you.

350
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,506
(Paul) Maybe if you get a chance,
you can let room service know

351
00:31:06,507 --> 00:31:07,866
that I'd like to place an order.

352
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,702
You sleep.
Tomorrow you work.

353
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,331
Yeah, that's why a little
food would be nice.

354
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,541
Steak or shrimp?

355
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:23,006
Who's the funny one now?

356
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,017
Steak or shrimp?

357
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:49,866
(cellmate) Death, life,
angels, principalities,

358
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:56,706
powers, things present,
things that are to come,

359
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:03,463
height, depth, and all creatures.

360
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:09,678
Death, life, angels, and...

361
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,223
<i>HEY</i>

362
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,435
I heard you talking.
What are you saying?

363
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,733
Well, I'm so sorry.

364
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:28,363
I've been repeating things
that I memorized by heart.

365
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,908
It helps to keep your mind alive.

366
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,661
I would have gone with
the periodic table, myself,

367
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,905
you know, instead of the
whole angels-and-death thing.

368
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,748
Periodic table?

369
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,709
Why, that's...
that's brilliant!

370
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,088
That's hydrogen, helium,
lithium, beryllium.

371
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,715
That's brilliant!

372
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,967
Mine's good, too.
It's from the Bible, you know.

373
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:53,597
It's a list of those things
that cannot separate us

374
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,765
from the love of God.

375
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,559
- Really?
- Yeah.

376
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,761
Well, I'd say being chained up
in an animal cage

377
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,771
is about as separate as it gets.

378
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,902
You're the doctor?

379
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,446
How'd they get a farang?

380
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,697
What?

381
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:15,494
Farang, a white man, American?

382
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,997
Who are these people?

383
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,249
Well, at first, I thought
they were just pirates.

384
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:23,919
But I think it's a bit more than that.

385
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,462
They do regular runs.

386
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,256
They referred to a cargo,
but I think it's just their way

387
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,758
of saying people...

388
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,385
- Human traffickers?
- Yes.

389
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,921
These are not the brightest
of the suns of the morning.

390
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,189
They're not the masterminds.

391
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,433
This is just the transportation department.

392
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,435
How did you get here?

393
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,064
Wrong place, wrong time, nice boat.

394
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,691
Oh, by the way, I'm Malcolm Andrews.

395
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,859
Paul Jordan.

396
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,195
(Malcolm) So did you treat the captain?

397
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,239
Well, I removed the bullet,

398
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,867
but we'll just have to wait and see.

399
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,502
Do you know what happened to him?

400
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:59,371
Did you notice a girl at the house?

401
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,122
There were two.

402
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,750
One of them grew so tired
of her terms of servitude

403
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,002
that she grabbed his gun
and shot him in the leg.

404
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,756
His men shot her in the head.

405
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,775
Do you know why they're keeping you alive?

406
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,552
Ransom.

407
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,470
I managed to plant the idea of ransom

408
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,598
into their greedy little minds.

409
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,851
Now listen, you take these blankets.

410
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,604
The name of the game is survival.

411
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,983
You and I are going to
stay as fit as we can.

412
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,110
We're going to keep our morale high,

413
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,988
and we're going to keep our
eyes open for that opportunity

414
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,866
that we will get to escape.

415
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,702
All right?

416
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,745
And don't worry.

417
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,499
As long as you're useful,
they will keep you alive.

418
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,793
What happens if I'm not?

419
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:52,007
Well, I will cover your back,
and you will cover mine.

420
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,806
Glad you're here.
It will make escape easier.

421
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,069
(Kim) Michelle, hey, it's Kim.

422
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,072
Sorry to call so late.
I needed to talk.

423
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,366
Something's happened.

424
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,702
Paul's missing.

425
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:26,249
His brother and my dad are
getting ready to ﬂy out.

426
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,545
Can you pray for us?

427
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,049
And call me as soon as you can.

428
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,675
Thanks

429
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,066
"And the peace of God
which passes every thought

430
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:57,113
will guard our hearts and
our minds in Jesus Christ."

431
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,161
[sighing] Paul.

432
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:23,867
[Malcolm singing]

433
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,746
Could you just stop singing
for a second, please?

434
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,082
(Malcolm) Willingly.

435
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,753
Tell me, is it the song you
object to, or all the singing?

436
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,173
Nothing personal, but both.

437
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:43,052
(Malcolm) Do you know that
song happened to be true?

438
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,638
It's the truth.

439
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,183
Let me tell you something
quite amazing about that.

440
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:53,438
The song writer composed
that as he was sailing over

441
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,151
the very waters where four
of his daughters had drowned.

442
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,528
And that was after he lost a son,

443
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,825
and he lost his entire
business in the Chicago fire.

444
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,703
That's the worst story I've ever heard.

445
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,506
Who would write a song to a God
that doesn't have enough power

446
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:12,916
to stop a tragedy like that?

447
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,043
If snot a question of power.

448
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,003
The guy lost everything.

449
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,130
His innocent children were killed.

450
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,581
If God had any power at all,

451
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,717
why would he allow that to happen?

452
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,721
Unless he has some
twisted sense of justice.

453
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,098
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

454
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,101
What, do you think we
deserve to be here right now,

455
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,945
forced through the jungle at gunpoint,

456
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:35,163
chained in an animal cage?

457
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,273
Why, because we're good people?

458
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,068
Oh, my dear friend, you have
no idea about me, have you?

459
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,319
What are you saying?

460
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,921
That when you're not reading
the Bible and singing hymns,

461
00:38:44,013 --> 00:38:44,881
you do bad things?

462
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,199
No.

463
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,660
I'm saying that I have been a sinner.

464
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,745
And I have made mistakes.

465
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,664
All of us have made mistakes.

466
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,459
Yeah, well, surgeons aren't
allowed to make mistakes.

467
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,380
Yeah, well sailors make up for them, then.

468
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,424
You know, I started off in the Royal Navy.

469
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,469
I was a sailor in the
full sense of the word.

470
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,097
And when I got out, I found
a very good line of business.

471
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,475
I made a bucket-load
of money,

472
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,271
but I left a trail of personal disaster

473
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:20,191
like a big wake behind me.

474
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,151
But you turned it around.

475
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,237
No.

476
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,990
I didn't turn it around.

477
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,201
God turned it around.

478
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,034
I'm gonna need him to take
500 milligrams of penicillin,

479
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,920
3 times a day.

480
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:46,417
Thank you for coming
back today, Dr. Jordan.

481
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,485
The inspector insisted.

482
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,888
I think he wanted to make sure
I wasn't out chasing kids

483
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,348
into the street again.

484
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,601
You know, I'd like to prioritize
as much as we can

485
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,103
and leave basic medicine
to the end of the day.

486
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,064
We'll be packing up tonight
and moving for Om Noi tomorrow.

487
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,216
I don't want to leave
the bigger things undone.

488
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:05,403
About packing up...

489
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,030
I can't leave Paul.

490
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,781
Until we get some word, I can't...

491
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,175
Paul's gonna be all right.
We're only a half an hour away,

492
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,319
and you can return as soon
as there's some news.

493
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,997
We really need you,
Dr. Jordan.

494
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,666
What are you gonna be doing,
sitting and waiting

495
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,921
while your skill's so
desperately needed elsewhere?

496
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,964
I can't just leave him.

497
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,758
What if he comes back looking for me?

498
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,551
What's the word from your Embassy?

499
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,428
They send a regional security officer

500
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,180
if there's evidence of a crime.

501
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:36,184
So far they're not taking it seriously.

502
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,186
I'm truly sorry,
Dr. Jordan.

503
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,397
I hope they find some answers for you.

504
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,616
(Malcolm) You didn't like what I said.

505
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:56,913
It's your story.
It's fine with me.

506
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,124
(Malcolm) And yours is different?

507
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,922
You know, my wife goes
for that sort of thing.

508
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:12,428
I just... I just don't.

509
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,181
Why?

510
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,225
Because you reject the existence of God,

511
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:22,897
or because you believe but disapprove?

512
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,400
I guess I prefer to believe
in no God than in one

513
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:30,822
that has the power to stop
tragedies but doesn't.

514
00:41:31,014 --> 00:41:32,440
I mean, if burning down businesses

515
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,750
and killing innocent children
is his MO then believe me,

516
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,996
I've got a few choice words for him myself.

517
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,040
Can I hear your choice words?

518
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,084
No.

519
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,253
Why not?

520
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,089
What? You think God's
a bit too thin-skinned

521
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,550
to hear your criticism?

522
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:54,095
Come on, yell it out!

523
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,263
I don't want to.

524
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,307
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Yell it out!

525
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,394
I mean, if he exists, then he's hearing us.

526
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,440
But if he doesn't exist,
then it's just jungle anyway!

527
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:06,607
God?

528
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,659
It's pretty sad when
you're wishing a pirate

529
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,636
take you away right now.

530
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,945
(Malcolm) God?

531
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,321
Can you see me?

532
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,533
I'm in a cage, a cage!

533
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:16,951
Come on, yell.

534
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,369
I don't want to, okay?

535
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,455
(Malcolm) Is this part of your plan, Lord?

536
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,957
Is this part of your grand design?

537
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,459
Would you just be quiet?
They're gonna come over here.

538
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,154
(Malcolm) Because I think it stinks!

539
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,215
I think you're making a
lousy job of this universe!

540
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,084
Come on now, if you've got a complaint,

541
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,343
now is the time to make it.

542
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,945
I'm hungry, and I wanna go home.

543
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,473
(Malcolm) I am dirty and I stink!

544
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,391
And I don't deserve this!

545
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,559
I miss my wife.

546
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,661
(Malcolm) Why do you let
the innocent suffer?

547
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,396
We came here to help these people.

548
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,357
(Malcolm) Why do the bad
guys always have to win?

549
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,485
Why did you take my daughter away from me?

550
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:54,447
Why did you take away Maddie?!

551
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,381
Hey!

552
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,802
Hey! Shut up.

553
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,553
Stop yelling!

554
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,348
What's wrong with him?

555
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,184
He's hungry.

556
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:28,981
If he is to look after your
captain, bring him food.

557
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,193
He must keep up his strength.

558
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,091
Ashes to beauty.

559
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,093
I know God can do that.

560
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,554
I know it.

561
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,932
I have to tell you, I don't see exactly how

562
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,601
he's gonna pull this one off.

563
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,812
I believe he will.

564
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,231
You want to know why I believe he will?

565
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:17,238
Because he wrote it down:

566
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:22,493
"He that spared not his own Son

567
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,371
"delivered him up for us all.

568
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,834
"How shall he not, with him,

569
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:34,046
also freely give us
all things?"

570
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,677
Romans 8:32.

571
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:49,437
I wish he'd freely give us
a key to this cage right now.

572
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,523
Yeah?

573
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,818
I'll join you in that prayer.

574
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,198
Know English?

575
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,950
It says here your hand Is it joint pain?

576
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,161
May I see your hand?

577
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,214
That's my husband.

578
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,965
Do you recognize him?

579
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,800
Have you seen him?

580
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,136
Dr. Kiet!

581
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,327
What did she say?

582
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:47,828
Where did she see him?

583
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,623
She saw him in an alley behind her shop.

584
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:54,043
He was being chased, possibly taken.

585
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,254
Who was it?

586
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,589
Well, from the description she gave me,

587
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,592
it could have been hundreds of young men.

588
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,678
You know, this is very, very serious.

589
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,098
Please, contact your Embassy immediately.

590
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,350
But who would take Paul like this?

591
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:12,436
You want my best guess?

592
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:17,024
It could have been somebody
who needed a doctor very badly.

593
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,705
That's a purpura rash.

594
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,666
It's a sign there's
bacteria in his bloodstream.

595
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,268
I told you we need antibiotics.

596
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,754
(Lek) You told us because
you want to go back.

597
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,215
You want to escape.

598
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,343
I told you that so we'd save his life.

599
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:11,931
Why bring a doctor here if
you're not gonna listen to him?

600
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,184
Stop!

601
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,977
What do you need?

602
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,271
He needs clindamycin, penicillin,

603
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,024
and an IV-drip in the next
24 hours or he's a dead man.

604
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:26,404
Do you understand me?

605
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,614
You write it down.

606
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,386
How is your captain doing?

607
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,571
If these kids don't find
some antibiotics soon,

608
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:57,852
he's a dead man, and so am I.

609
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,228
Well, they took my boat.
There was a satellite phone.

610
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,982
You didn't happen to see it
in there, did you?

611
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,692
No.

612
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,694
(Malcolm) They'd be fools to switch it on.

613
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:09,280
They must have used it
to make the ransom call,

614
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,740
probably took it out to sea.

615
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,076
How long before you think they'd notice?

616
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,246
We will have to be out
of the way before then.

617
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,833
Now, if I create a diversion,

618
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,503
could you have a good look around?

619
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,880
You got it.

620
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,486
Inspector?

621
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,823
There is nothing to report.

622
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,158
I'm sorry.

623
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,910
I thought you might be hungry.

624
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,870
Thank you.
I have another question.

625
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:02,583
There was a woman here.
Her name was Somsri?

626
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,144
I've cross-checked everything
between the two incidents,

627
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,204
and I find no connection
between the two cases,

628
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,381
except for the fact that
they're both kidnappings.

629
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,308
The British are combing this case, too.

630
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,119
We just have to wait
and see what they find.

631
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,678
Her husband's British?

632
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,473
He's a retired technology
magnet of some sort.

633
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,124
I think you should sit with her.

634
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,277
Maybe you two could find a
connection that we didn't.

635
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,480
It would get you out of my lobby
for a couple hours, anyway.

636
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,861
(Dr. Kiet) How's that
inventory coming?

637
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,073
I'm almost done.

638
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:20,160
I hope you've changed
your mind about coming with us.

639
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,789
Actually, do you know a
woman named Somsri Andrews?

640
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:26,074
Yes, she and her husband
made a very generous donation

641
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,293
towards our coming here.

642
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,961
That sounds right.

643
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,171
Her husband's also missing.

644
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,590
What?

645
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,741
It doesn't seem like
the two cases are related,

646
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:39,555
but she invited me to stay
with her so I can be close.

647
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,271
(female ♪2) I'm looking for Kim Jordan.

648
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:48,731
I'm Kim.

649
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,942
I'm Sue Griggs.
I'm from the U.S. Embassy.

650
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,110
Excuse me, Doctor.

651
00:51:53,202 --> 00:51:55,512
(Sue Griggs) We certainly had
plenty of calls and e-mails

652
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,273
at the Embassy from
your friends and family.

653
00:51:57,274 --> 00:51:59,609
I've mentioned it to a few of them.

654
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,869
What's the Embassy doing now?

655
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,621
I know you're concerned.

656
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,873
I met with the local
authorities this morning.

657
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,000
They're still searching for the boy.

658
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,960
What about the Andrews' case?

659
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,070
We're still following
with the British Embassy

660
00:52:12,071 --> 00:52:13,381
on their case, if it's related.

661
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,049
We're all doing everything we can.

662
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,343
What am I supposed to do?
What can I do?

663
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,386
There's nothing really you can do.

664
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,848
No. Everybody keeps saying
that, and it's unacceptable.

665
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,767
We're doctors.
We fix things.

666
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,019
There's always something more you can do.

667
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,104
Until there isn't.

668
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,940
What does that mean?

669
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,934
Ms. Jordan, everything
I've read and heard

670
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,946
about your husband tells me he's
an intelligent, capable man.

671
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,866
We're doing our best.
I'm sure he's doing his best.

672
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,452
What more can you ask?

673
00:52:44,086 --> 00:52:45,946
(Paul) How long do you
think you're gonna need?

674
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,314
(Malcolm) Three, four minutes.

675
00:52:47,406 --> 00:52:50,167
Trust me, I was an
explorer scout when I was 15.

676
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:51,794
Good luck.

677
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,048
[whistling]

678
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,634
Hey, I need to see the captain!

679
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,136
It's important!

680
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,888
I'm sorry.

681
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,590
I forgot something.
I gotta see him.

682
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,016
It's important.

683
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,312
It's important, I need to
see the captain right away.

684
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:11,930
(Malcolm) Doctor must see captain.

685
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,357
Doctor worried about captain.

686
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,945
If captain die, brother will blame you.

687
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,197
Doctor must see captain, urgent.

688
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,991
Doctor fears if captain dies.

689
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,202
- It's urgent
- Urgent, quick.

690
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:50,436
(Paul) There's a lot of
dirt in those animal cages.

691
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,788
I don't wanna infect him,
so I just wanna make sure

692
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,314
I'm clean, okay?

693
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,152
You're making me nervous with that thing.

694
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,784
You know, just so we
don't have any accidents...

695
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,328
Thank you.

696
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,380
That's not looking so good.

697
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,349
Okay, okay.
Hold your horses.

698
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,495
M Burning in my soul M

699
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,663
M Burning in my soul M

700
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,959
The fire of heavenly love
is burning in my soul

701
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,284
(Malcolm)
Help! Fire!

702
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,495
Fire! Fire!

703
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,289
Fire! Don't let me burn!
Please!

704
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,043
Help! Fire!

705
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,087
(Paul) Maybe you should go check on him.

706
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,455
Go, go see what he wants.

707
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,665
I'll stay here; I'll take
care of the captain, okay?

708
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,843
Go!

709
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,808
(Malcolm) Help me!
Don't let me burn to death!

710
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,643
Fire! Fire!

711
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,271
Lek, Lek, please save me!

712
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,189
Don't let me burn, please!

713
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,899
I beg you, Lek.
Don't let me burn!

714
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,069
Hey! Shut your mouth!

715
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,737
(Malcolm) I beg you!

716
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:12,953
[Malcolm's yelling continues]

717
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,265
(Malcolm) Okay, okay, okay.

718
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:37,060
Please, if I burn, no ransom.

719
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,980
If there's no ransom, they will kill you.

720
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,107
Okay, okay, okay

721
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,942
What do I know?
Lek, listen to me.

722
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,528
Listen to me, I will tell
them what a hero you were.

723
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,655
You were wonderful.

724
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,749
It's okay.

725
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,835
He's just in a lot of pain.

726
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,795
This hurts him a lot.

727
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,383
It's fine. It's just
really painful for him.

728
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,767
Well? Did you see it?

729
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,810
Did you see it?

730
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,437
Yeah.

731
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,897
And?

732
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,357
It's under the bed.

733
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:25,859
But I think the girl and
the captain may have seen me

734
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,561
but she's got no loyalty to them.

735
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,128
She's not gonna say anything, right?

736
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,340
Paul, serving maid is a
downside better position

737
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,408
than human cargo.

738
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,411
She's gonna wanna keep her position.

739
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,623
You better pray harder then, my friend.

740
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,342
Do you want to come out to
the children's home with me?

741
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:55,389
I'm sure somebody
needs a check-up.

742
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,599
It'll take your mind off things.

743
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,936
Yeah, I think I can handle that.

744
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,270
Of course you can.

745
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,189
You are very capable.

746
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,233
I don't mean technically.

747
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,069
Paul and I had a baby girl.

748
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,030
She was 4 months old when she died.

749
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,157
It was SIDS.

750
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,826
We were good parents.

751
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,786
We did everything right.

752
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,204
I know you would.

753
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,206
It's not that I expect everything in life

754
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,291
to be perfect, it's just...

755
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:29,673
why give a gift if it has to be
so cruelly taken away?

756
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,175
Why?

757
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,512
It's a broken world, isn't it?

758
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,648
(Malcolm) What was the
name of your little girl?

759
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,109
(Paul) Madison.

760
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,319
We called her Maddie.

761
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,326
Madison.

762
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,538
That's a pretty name.

763
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,667
I have a son, you know.

764
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,295
Name's Charlie.

765
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:11,548
When he was young, I spent
all my time away at work,

766
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,966
never got to see him.

767
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,469
And when I had made enough to retire early,

768
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,345
he was gone.

769
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:21,141
And so was his mom.

770
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:25,812
I suppose there's all kinds
of ways you can lose somebody.

771
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,775
Yes, but that was my fault;
Yours wasn't.

772
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,278
That is why I am so
relieved that in the scales

773
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,533
of cosmic justice, God's grace
weighs so much in the scale.

774
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,286
I mean, the day I went sailing,

775
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,205
my wife was meant to come with me.

776
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,956
And then right at the last moment,

777
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:49,252
she received a call
and had to go into work.

778
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,662
Yeah, I think that's grace.

779
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,508
I'm glad she's not here.

780
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,427
If she was here, I know
exactly what she'd be saying.

781
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,845
She would be saying,

782
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:04,684
"In this world, you will
suffer tribulation,

783
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:10,315
but be of good cheer for
I have overcome the world."

784
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,902
That's John, isn't it?

785
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,449
Wish we had a Bible.

786
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,541
How did you meet?

787
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,293
I met him when he was a volunteer

788
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,337
at the children's home near here.

789
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,423
I work as liaison to the adoption agency.

790
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:36,842
That must be rewarding.

791
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,469
Sometimes.
Sometimes heart-breaking.

792
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,763
After the tsunami,
there were many more children

793
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,099
than we could place.

794
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,268
But you and your husband the nobel one;

795
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,479
Bringing your skill so far to help others.

796
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,982
Please, don't say "nobel."

797
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,651
The truth is, I didn't
come here to help others.

798
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,821
I thought maybe it could help me.

799
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,990
Has it?

800
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,784
They're back.

801
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,587
(Paul) What are they saying?

802
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,556
I got your medicine.

803
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,183
Get out.

804
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,023
Just let me look at it.

805
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,611
Good, no?

806
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:38,945
Yeah, this will work.

807
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,489
Here, put your hand up.

808
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,908
Hold that, okay.

809
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,534
High, okay?

810
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,544
This might hurt a little bit.

811
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,570
His arm's gonna get tired,
so you might need to find

812
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,597
something to hang that thing up with, okay?

813
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,432
It needs to be high.

814
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:18,351
A little antibiotic, this is what I need.

815
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,569
This is good.

816
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,946
Antibiotic.

817
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,165
(Malcolm) Please, leave
some for the doctor,

818
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,901
the doctor.

819
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:03,738
Good, good.

820
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,757
We need to get out of here.
He's sleeping now.

821
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,342
Shh, shh.

822
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,511
He's sleeping, Okay?

823
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,732
We need to hang that up.

824
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,734
Hang that up.

825
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,528
And we need to go, just leave him alone.

826
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,616
I will take you with me.
I promise you.

827
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:49,993
Thank you.

828
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,163
Thank you.
Go, go, go, go.

829
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,792
I'll come back and check on him.

830
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,330
We need to get out of here now,
with or without a phone.

831
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,541
May he give all things freely unto you.

832
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,670
Excellent.

833
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,881
I got a little surprise myself.

834
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,763
(Malcolm) Whoa, quick hands.

835
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,099
Time for a little surgery.

836
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,692
(Malcolm) It's powering up.

837
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,903
It's ringing.

838
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,201
[phone ringing]

839
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:14,994
It's from Malcolm's phone.

840
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,621
(Kim) Answer it.

841
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,832
(Somsri) Hello?

842
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,667
(Malcolm) Somsri, it's Malcolm.

843
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,377
- Malcolm!
- Yes, darling, yes.

844
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:23,795
Where are you?
Are you okay?

845
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,422
We've been searching.

846
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,865
(Malcolm) Listen carefully:
The battery on this phone

847
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:29,951
is about to give up.
Get someone to trace it.

848
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,178
(Somsri) I'm sure it's already being done.

849
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,947
They are monitoring for your signal.

850
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,365
(Kim) I'll call the inspector.

851
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:39,352
Now listen carefully:
I'm on an island on the coast.

852
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,937
I don't know which one it is.

853
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:44,065
I'm with an American, Paul Jordan.

854
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,483
He's a doctor.

855
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,110
Paul Jordan?

856
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:48,653
Paul's wife is here with me.

857
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,071
What?

858
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,582
Kim, she's there?

859
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:54,233
(Somsri) Are you both all right, love?

860
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,843
(Malcolm) Yes, yes, we're both fine.

861
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,079
Now listen, we have to
make a break for it now.

862
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,582
Can I talk to Paul?

863
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,833
(Malcolm) Can you patch
me through to the police

864
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,294
so I can
arrange a pick-up?

865
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,754
If we lose communication, we are heading

866
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,841
towards the eastern shore, you understand?

867
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,177
I got it.

868
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,762
We need a boat or a
helicopter to pick us up.

869
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,098
There are four men, heavily armed.

870
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,767
You understand?
Four men, armed.

871
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,686
Eastern shore.

872
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,104
Got that?

873
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,358
Eastern shore, four men,
all armed, one injured.

874
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,985
Got to go.

875
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,115
Hello?
Hello, Malcolm?

876
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,911
(Inspector) I'm looking at his file now.
It's 7-O-0...

877
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:39,287
The satellite company has a signal

878
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:41,148
from the Englishman's phone.
It just turned on.

879
01:06:41,149 --> 01:06:42,234
I'll call you back.

880
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:48,963
O Lord, I feel your presence here even now.

881
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,932
(Paul) We're gonna have a little company.

882
01:06:50,934 --> 01:06:52,519
I'll stall for as long as I can.

883
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,670
You kill our captain.

884
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,838
You kill him.
He's dead.

885
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,715
No, no.
Your captain was septic.

886
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,333
He needed that medicine days ago.

887
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,085
If anybody killed him, it was you for not

888
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,096
getting it to him soon enough.

889
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,766
You know good English?
We kill you now!

890
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,877
Someone came, they are arguing,

891
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,130
but I cannot hear the words.

892
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,904
(Somsri on phone)
Hello? Hello, Malcolm?

893
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:41,909
M Heavily peace divine has come forth M

894
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,205
M Here by faith in him to dwell M

895
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:47,874

896
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,293
(pirate)
Shut up! Shut up!

897
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,253
(Malcolm) Sorry, sorry.

898
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,674
It's just that Paul and I
just love to sing, don't we?

899
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:57,842
What?

900
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,638
(Malcolm) We love to sing, especially
when we're alive and well.

901
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,056
(Pirate) Shut up!

902
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,432
I love singing.

903
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:16,861
There was a gunshot.

904
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,655
We heard it.

905
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:21,866
I'll tap in, and we'll take it from here.

906
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,911
Mr. Andrews?

907
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,914
You have the attention
of the Royal Thai Police.

908
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:31,459
We have a bead on your location,
working on your helicopter.

909
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:36,297
Please give me a signal
you can still hear me.

910
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,467
Mr. Andrews,
are you there?

911
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,969
Mr. Andrews, give me a signal
you can still hear me.

912
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,346
Is everyone okay?

913
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:44,889
Where is Malcolm?

914
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,307
Malcolm, where are you?

915
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,725
They don't see you.

916
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,102
(Kim) Paul?

917
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,479
(Somsri) ls everyone okay?

918
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,734
It's just a ﬂesh wound.

919
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,113
Keep this on there, okay, so
you don't lose any more blood.

920
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,323
Tell him, keep this on here.

921
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,288
I'll take a look at it tomorrow.

922
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,484
We're going now, running east.

923
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,736
Battery is almost dead,
so I'm gonna switch off.

924
01:10:40,828 --> 01:10:41,754
Please be there.

925
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,865
Get me the helicopter clearance now!

926
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,426
[(whispering] Come on.

927
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,245
(Malcolm) Need a little help right now.

928
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,015
(Malcolm)
Paul, wait! Wait!

929
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,391
What?

930
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,059
They'll kill us on sight.

931
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,729
I promised the maid we would take her.

932
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,022
You're kidding me?

933
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,982
The maid of the house gave us the phone.

934
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,693
I gave her my word that
we would take her with us.

935
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,745
We'll find some help
and we'll send it back.

936
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:25,082
Look, the moment they connect
her with our disappearance,

937
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,117
she is dead.

938
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,328
You go, I will join you at the beach.

939
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,206
I gave her...

940
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:34,373
Hurry!

941
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,417
(Malcolm)
...My word!

942
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,389
No!

943
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,811
(Malcolm) Easy, boy.
Easy, easy, easy.

944
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,438
It's okay.

945
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,748
(Paul) That was close.

946
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,959
They killed the girl.

947
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,318
(Malcolm) Go on, quick!

948
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,092
[screaming]

949
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:03,976
Come on, come on.

950
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,697
Keep going!
I'm fine.

951
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,499
Come on! Come on!

952
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,296
Okay.

953
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,174
Now!

954
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,509
Okay, okay.
Don't shoot.

955
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,511
I'm unarmed.

956
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,722
It's okay.

957
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,601
Hey!

958
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:26,785
Malcolm, you okay?

959
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,621
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine

960
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,581
Why'd you do that?

961
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,583
He was about to kill you.

962
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,170
I told you I'd have your back.

963
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,756
Can you make it to the beach?

964
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:43,469
I'll tell you what, you go on ahead.

965
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,679
I'm not leaving without you.

966
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,740
The bullets are still in there.

967
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:13,624
Paul, it's all right.

968
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,294
It's all right.

969
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,671
I'm ready.

970
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,591
I'm ready.

971
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,052
Now, remember all I told you

972
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:29,723
about how I got turned around.

973
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,102
Tell Somsri I love her.

974
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,731
Tell her I never lost faith.

975
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:45,823
With Charlie, tell him...
tell him I'm sorry.

976
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:57,835
Lord, thy will be done.

977
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,398
We were so close!

978
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:07,154
We were so close!

979
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,990
Why did you take him away?

980
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,999
I don't know.

981
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:24,546
He didn't deserve to die like that.

982
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:27,591
I can't do this.

983
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:32,054
I can't do this any more.

984
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:37,267
I try to be a good father,
you took my child from me.

985
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,437
I try to be a good friend,
and you take Malcolm from me.

986
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,982
Please, Lord Jesus,
don't take my wife away.

987
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:48,779
Please, please.

988
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,823
I surrender.

989
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,784
I surrender.

990
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:58,330
I can't do this by myself any more.

991
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:02,793
God, I need you now.

992
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,087
I need your help.

993
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:08,340
Lord Jesus, please help me.

994
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,801
I surrender to you.

995
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:12,719
I know I haven't been a devoted man,

996
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,848
but I have tried so hard.

997
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,934
I came here to help these people,

998
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:22,938
and now I need your help.

999
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,860
I need your help, please.

1000
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:45,745
[phone ringing]

1001
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,050
- Hello?
- Mr. Andrews?

1002
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,469
No, no, this is Paul.

1003
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,053
Oh my God, Paul?

1004
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,264
Kim, I'm so sorry.

1005
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,682
Don't be sorry.

1006
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,809
There's a helicopter close.
Hang on.

1007
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,187
Mr. Jordan, we have a
bead on your location.

1008
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,730

ls everyone okay?
Where is Malcolm?

1010
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,155
No.

1011
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,827
Paul, where is Malcolm?

1012
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,040
He didn't...
he didn't make it.

1013
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:31,381
He saved my life, but he didn't make it.

1014
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,592
I'm so sorry.

1015
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:40,140
Kim, Kim, tell her I'm so sorry, please.

1016
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:08,877
Thank you, God.

1017
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,046
Thank you.

1018
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:15,384
Hey!

1019
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:16,760
Thank you.

1020
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,807
Everybody out.
One at a time, one at a time.

1021
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:08,020
[children cheering]

1022
01:25:08,112 --> 01:25:09,387
I think we've poked and prodded

1023
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,399
just about everybody
there is to poke and prod.

1024
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,705
(Somsri) Malcolm would
have loved to see this.

1025
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,782
Oh, believe me, he's watching us right now,

1026
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:29,916
seeing this moment.

1027
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,085
Oh yes, you are right.

1028
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,046
Hey!

1029
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,464
How are you?

1030
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,467
Is that bothering you still?

1031
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,093
Phx.

1032
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,430
Did she just say "daddy"?

1033
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:45,057
Yes.

1034
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:49,978
Time for gifts.

1035
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,396
Shall We?

1036
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,231
Of course.
