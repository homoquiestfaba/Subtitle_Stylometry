1
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,958
l'm Eliza Thornberry.

2
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,029
Part of your average family.

3
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,030
l've got a dad and a mom.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,135
And a sister.

5
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,135
There's Donnie. We found him.

6
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,309
And Darwin...he found us.

7
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,670
We travel all over the world.

8
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,716
See, my dad hosts this nature show,
and my mom shoots it.

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,856
And along the way,
something amazing happened.

10
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,582
l freed a warthog
who was really a shaman.

11
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,159
Shaman Mnyambo.

12
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,196
He granted me
the power to talk to animals.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,030
lt's really cool...but totally secret.

14
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:52,704
And that was just the beginning
of my biggest adventure ever.

15
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:56,665
And now, Phaedra the Magnificent
will walk the Circle of Destiny!

16
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,475
Circle of Destiny, indeed!

17
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,076
Phew! Eliza, your friend stinks.

18
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,914
And those tusks
could poke an eye out.

19
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,487
Darwin, chill.

20
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,353
- Phaedra, take us around that tree.
- Sure.

21
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,859
Here's how our moms make us go.

22
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:20,294
They nudge the back of our necks
with their trunks.

23
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,298
- Really? Like this?
- That's it!

24
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:29,032
And if she wanted us to turn around,
she'd nudge one side.

25
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,434
Oh, cool!

26
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,545
Rub behind the ear and
the elephant turns. Fascinating!

27
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,478
Eliza, can we go now?
My butt's gone to sleep.

28
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,585
OK, Darwin.

29
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,381
- Bye, Eliza.
- Bye, Phaedra.

30
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,558
Bye...chimp!

31
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:51,392
l think l hear your grandmumsy
opening a fresh tin of pudding.

32
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,965
- Darwin, listen.
- To what? l don't hear a thing.

33
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,865
That's what l mean. lt's too quiet.

34
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,105
lt's a shame you couldn't spend
more time with us, Mumsy.

35
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,573
Two weeks is more than enough.

36
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,612
Your father gets a bit daft
when left on his own too long.

37
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,877
He's probably searched the entire
estate for his reading glasses.

38
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,215
Good thing l take after you,
eh, Mumsy?

39
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,292
Marianne, have you had any luck
locating my binoculars?

40
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,362
Try around your neck!

41
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,902
Bad news!

42
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,700
Jungle Boy used the teapot
to store his grub-worms.

43
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,738
Dad! Mom! Stampede!

44
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,075
Battle stations, everybody!

45
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,783
Mumsy! Stand absolutely still!

46
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,863
They're not carnivores.
The gazelle is quite harmless.

47
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,194
Unless you happen to be
a tuft of grass!

48
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,106
lt's Akela!

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,072
- Does this sort of thing happen often?
- No.

50
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,478
Thank goodness!

51
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:26,250
Cordelia, l hate to leave you, but we
need to get some footage before dark.

52
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,257
Yes, Mumsy.
Will you be all right here?

53
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:34,058
Don't worry. The girls and l will have
a nice quiet evening together.

54
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,861
See you later, then! Bye bye!

55
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,666
Just when we get something cool
to drive, l have to be grounded!

56
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:47,107
Certainly you're grounded.
You tied Donnie to a termite mound.

57
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,281
Hey, he was happy.

58
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,783
- Eliza, where are you going?
- Just going for a walk!

59
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,183
Have we forgotten
about that cheetah?

60
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:02,384
lt's OK, Grandmumsy,
l do it all the time.

61
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,794
Deborah, does your sister...?

62
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,626
Talk like a monkey,
dress like a geek? Yeah!

63
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,326
Come on,
Akela's cubs must be nearby.

64
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,906
Cheetah cubs? To them,
l'm a walking snack pack!

65
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,221
- Hey, guys!
- lt's Eliza!

66
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,860
Oh, you've grown so big.
Hey, where's Tally?

67
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,157
Here l am! You should see me run.
l'm really fast now.

68
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,962
Fast? As in ''able to outrun
defenceless chimps''?

69
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,534
You guys remember Darwin.

70
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,370
l've got an idea.

71
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,376
- Let's have a race.
- Yeah! Me first.

72
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,141
Children! lt's time for dinner.

73
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,811
- Not me, l'm skin and bones.
- Mom, Eliza wants us to race.

74
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:07,152
No, the plains are too dangerous
for little ones like you.

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,160
But l'll be with them.
l'd never let anything happen.

76
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,491
You can trust me.

77
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,360
Please, Mom!

78
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,468
All right, Eliza.

79
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,902
But keep an eye on them.
And don't go beyond the acacia tree.

80
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,912
Hey, slowpokes, l'm winning!

81
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,318
Who are you calling slowpoke?

82
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,989
Eliza, you've passed the acacia tree!

83
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,995
Just barely!

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,169
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

85
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,073
Poachers!

86
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,777
Run!

87
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,570
Eliza!

88
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,446
No!

89
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,674
Eliza!

90
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,678
Give him back!

91
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,982
He's just a baby!

92
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,086
Deborah, bring the Commvee
straight away!

93
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,659
l wish l could, but l'm grounded!

94
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,159
Debbie, now!

95
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,875
Deborah, slow down immediately!

96
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,673
Sorry, Grandmumsy. Dad's orders.

97
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,154
Donnie, this is no time
for the wedgie dance!

98
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,916
Will somebody do something?

99
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,524
Somebody?

100
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,185
We'll discuss your impertinence later,
young lady!

101
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,865
Follow that helicopter!

102
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,062
l couldn't have had a sister
who plays with dolls.

103
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,331
Hello, Mumsy. Having a jolly holiday?

104
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,996
Nigel, we must discuss
your children's manners.

105
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,009
We're equally as proud,
but now's not the time.

106
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,089
My baby!

107
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,584
My baby.

108
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,893
We can't just sit here.
We have to find those poachers.

109
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,436
You were almost killed.
Let Jomo take care of them.

110
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,440
- But, Mom, l have to save Tally.
- Who?

111
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,612
That's what l call the cheetah cub.

112
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,680
She names man-eating wild animals?

113
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,079
Names 'em, plays with 'em,
talks in monkey to 'em!

114
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,776
Debbie, enough!

115
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:07,084
- Could you identify this man, Eliza?
- No. He shined a light in my eyes.

116
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,696
But the handle of his knife was
carved in the shape of a falcon.

117
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,489
That'll help, won't it?

118
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,894
There are many knives,
many poachers.

119
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:21,005
- But l have to find Tally.
- Eliza, you must leave this to us.

120
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:26,167
Promise me, you will never go off
alone at night.

121
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,675
l promise.

122
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,214
Good girl.
Nigel, l will call if l hear anything.

123
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,478
- Good night, all.
- Thank you, Jomo.

124
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,215
Eliza! Don't go out
in the savannah at night.

125
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,394
Yeah, right! She and the monkey
are always sneaking off!

126
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,392
- What?
- Debbie!

127
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,724
l've covered long enough.

128
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,800
She once fed one of my protein bars
to a Komodo dragon!

129
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,370
And in wherever-land,
she rode a Siberian tiger!

130
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:58,737
And ask about the time she was
dancing with crazy dingoes!

131
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,572
- What?
- That's not the half of it!

132
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,375
- Eliza!
- Thanks, Deb!

133
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,552
Nigel...l don't know what to do.

134
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:13,191
Well, l do! Elizabeth has no regard
for her own safety.

135
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:18,091
We have discussed this for years.
She needs a structured environment.

136
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,290
One such as a boarding school
back in London!

137
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:27,461
Hold on! She messes up and
gets to go to boarding school?

138
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,164
Mumsy, that's rather drastic.

139
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,472
Need l remind you, that it was
in the confines of boarding school

140
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,707
that you received your education,
not here in the wild?

141
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:44,754
You don't think it's civilised for a girl
to play with cheetahs and chimps?

142
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,223
Hello! What about me?

143
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,362
Do l look civilised?

144
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:52,861
Frankly, no.

145
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,262
But l'm afraid
it's much too late for you.

146
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,027
Mom, Dad, l can't leave!

147
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:03,470
Tally never would've been out
on the plains if it wasn't for me.

148
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,577
- lt's all my fault.
- How?

149
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,646
- l have to go back out there!
- No!

150
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,909
We make these rules for a reason.

151
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,849
lf l have to send you away
to be safe, l will.

152
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,048
Dad? Please!

153
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,559
Poppet, your intentions are noble,

154
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,230
but you're just too young.

155
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,396
l'm sorry.

156
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:43,076
We agreed, when we took this job,
we wouldn't split up the family.

157
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,183
We'd keep the children
with us on the road.

158
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,876
l remember, dearest.

159
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,481
Oh, Nigel.
Are we doing the right thing?

160
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:58,629
You heard Eliza. She blames herself
for this unfortunate incident.

161
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,096
She'll never stop
until she finds that cub.

162
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,360
She's quite fearless, you know.

163
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,539
She takes after her father.

164
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,771
That poor girl.

165
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,383
Boarding school? l never heard
of anything so ridiculous!

166
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,284
Did anyone bother to ask my opinion?

167
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,052
l wish l could tell them
l talk to animals.

168
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,288
No! Then you'll lose your power,
and we'll never talk again!

169
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:39,699
- How will l know what Debbie's saying?
- Calm down, l won't break the rule.

170
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,703
Good.
Now, about this boarding school,

171
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,376
l can't take gym class,

172
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:50,378
because those tight shorts
show off my problem area.

173
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,186
Dar...you can't come with me.

174
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,315
Darwin, come back!

175
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:05,225
- Whatever is the matter with Darwin?
- He saw me pack my suitcase.

176
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,765
- l guess he figured out l'm leaving.
- Very intuitive, that chimp.

177
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,733
l'm sorry about all this, Dad.

178
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,339
l'm not sure l wouldn't have done
the same thing.

179
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,444
ln fact, l went up against poachers
myself once,

180
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,944
to save an elephant, remember?

181
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,241
l remember.

182
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,444
Come, let me show you
where we're headed next. The Congo.

183
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:33,785
- To look for forest elephants?
- Yes. lf we can find any.

184
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:39,932
There's an old, old Baaka legend,
that tells of a solar eclipse,

185
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:45,866
when thousands of elephants
made their way to Tembo Valley.

186
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,595
l wonder why.

187
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:53,210
Nobody knows. But there's an eclipse
in a few weeks in this exact spot.

188
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,041
And l intend to witness it first hand.

189
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,275
l wish l could see it with you, Dad.

190
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:07,153
Eliza, l received this medal
when l was in boarding school.

191
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,453
Perhaps you'd like to take it, for luck.

192
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,290
''Awarded for bravery.''

193
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,367
Oh...it was nothing, really.

194
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,097
A blazing building, twenty students
trapped, a makeshift rope ladder...

195
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,740
Well, never mind.

196
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:28,504
The point is you will have
your own challenges, Poppet,

197
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,879
and l predict,
you will meet them splendidly.

198
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:42,583
l looked everywhere for Darwin.
l didn't get to say goodbye.

199
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,629
l'm sorry, honey.
You'll see him again soon.

200
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,527
l love you.

201
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,168
l'll miss you, Mom.

202
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,361
You won't leave without him, Dad?

203
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,370
Of course not, Poppet.

204
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:00,602
Here's what you can get me
in London: CDs, boots, T-shirts.

205
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,781
Basically, anything cool.

206
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,714
Don't forget: ''cool''.

207
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,918
Elizabeth! lt's time for take-off!

208
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,621
Kiss your natural wilderness
girlhood goodbye!

209
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,312
Bye, Dad.

210
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,717
Look at that.

211
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,356
ls that a new girl?

212
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,013
Darwin!

213
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:57,519
You didn't think l'd let you get civilised
without me, did you?

214
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,656
- You can't be here!
- lt's a miracle l survived the hold!

215
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,456
Your bags are not handled
with care.

216
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,463
They don't allow chimps in school.

217
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,796
They'll change their mind
when they meet me!

218
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,372
Let's look at my new home.
Small yet charming.

219
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,375
Not much natural light,
but we've had enough of nature.

220
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,945
Dibs on this bed!

221
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,276
Feel those springs, firm yet flexible.

222
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,444
Could you lend me your cashmere
sweater for the dance?

223
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:35,616
- Someone's coming.
- Room service? l like school already!

224
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,159
Darwin, you can't be here!

225
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,793
But why?

226
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,628
- l'm a fast learner and...
- l can see your feet!

227
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,774
Let me in!

228
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,546
Are you still quibbling about
that 2% difference in our DNA?

229
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,808
Just be quiet
until l figure out what to do.

230
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,482
l'm Eliza Thornberry.
Guess we're room-mates.

231
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,281
So it appears.

232
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,890
l'm Sarah Wellington.

233
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,324
Have you been romping
on my bed?

234
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,726
Just trying out the springs.
Firm yet flexible.

235
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,730
Perhaps we should
negotiate a few issues.

236
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,995
You stay on your side
and l stay on mine.

237
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:24,164
My things shall be off-limits
as they are antique and expensive.

238
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,901
This perfume is French.

239
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,679
And don't even dream
about wearing my clothes.

240
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,976
No matter how tempting the urge.

241
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,383
l see that you've already rooted
through my wardrobe.

242
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,079
Sarah!

243
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,953
Want one of my mom's
home-made cookies?

244
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,958
l might have a use for you yet.

245
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,837
lt's so great to talk to you guys.

246
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,167
You have no idea how awful it's been.

247
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,368
Go on, Eliza,
tell Reggie your troubles.

248
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,174
l don't suppose you have any
of those cheesy snacks?

249
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,874
Cheese Munchies? Right here.

250
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,382
Brilliant!

251
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,680
Now, what's the problem?

252
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,517
l miss my friends in Africa.

253
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,057
You should see it there, Reggie.

254
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:19,025
l've even met some squirrels who fly.

255
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:23,133
Fly? Like a bird?
Don't like the sound of that!

256
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,969
l heard her family lives
in the jungle in a motor home!

257
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,803
And she bathes where animals drink!

258
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,943
Next she'll be bringing animals
into my room!

259
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:49,885
- Eliza, can you hear me? lt's Mom!
- And your dear old Dad!

260
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:55,294
- What did you say, honey?
- Has Jomo found Tally?

261
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,866
Sorry, Poppet, no.

262
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,470
ln fact, the poachers disappeared
without a trace.

263
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,837
- Tell her about Darwin.
- l was leading up to that.

264
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,571
Poodles, l'm afraid
we've lost track of Darwin.

265
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,411
He'll be all right. He's probably
foraging for bugs right now!

266
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,816
The shepherd's pie is heavenly.

267
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,753
But why do they put
these green things in it?

268
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,927
They look like bunny poop!

269
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:28,259
- Honey, is someone there?
- Just my room-mate, Sarah.

270
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,766
Mom, please don't forget
about Tally.

271
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,371
We won't.
We told Jomo where we're headed.

272
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,906
Try to have fun with your new friends.

273
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,374
She's making friends?
Give me that!

274
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,242
Hi. Here's what's going on
with my life.

275
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,612
Donnie's now half-goat,
my hair is half-terrier,

276
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,984
and we're heading into the abyss
where there's no teen interaction! Bye!

277
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,852
Oh, Debbie!

278
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,052
Debbie? Mom? Dad?

279
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,393
Donnie?

280
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:18,714
We're all a bit curious.
Have you ever seen a tiger up close?

281
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:22,114
- Close enough to pet.
- Oh, really?

282
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,016
Tigers, bears, Komodo dragons...

283
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:30,354
Once, we were in the Arctic
and l hung out with this polar bear.

284
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,190
Seems my room-mate
is making friends.

285
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,457
My friends!

286
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,398
- They're really gentle...
- Sarah, Eliza swam with whales.

287
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:46,339
- lsn't that lovely?
- Tell us more, Eliza.

288
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,559
Darwin!

289
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,198
l know! Don't l look fetching?

290
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:16,036
Where was l? Swimming
with dingoes...l mean dolphins...

291
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,439
Enough about me.
Anybody try the boiled cabbage?

292
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,547
l'm going back for seconds.
Anyone else?

293
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,776
- Who's that girl?
- Never seen her before.

294
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,514
- ls she Eliza's friend?
- That's my monogram!

295
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,319
Who are you and
why are you wearing my new blazer?

296
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,326
There's an ape in my uniform!

297
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,694
Give it back! Give it back!

298
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,803
- Did it escape from the zoo?
- Darwin, no!

299
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,445
Food fight, everyone!

300
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,688
Come back!

301
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,651
Girls! Girls! Food is for eating!

302
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,626
Food is for...

303
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,340
This is the best meal we've ever had!

304
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,854
Miss Thornberry, your grandmother
will hear of this in the morning.

305
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:43,187
And when we revive her, l'm sure
she'll be gravely disappointed.

306
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,228
Now, say goodbye to your pet...

307
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,092
...and come along!

308
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,428
Eliza, don't leave me in this place,
l'll never last the night!

309
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,233
No offence. l'm sure you're very nice.
''Thunder'', is it?

310
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:02,004
- How horsy!
- l'll come see you in the morning, Dar.

311
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:06,877
Trot along, lassie.
Your friend will be fine with me.

312
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,416
Thanks, Thunder.

313
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,748
Miss Thornberry? Come along!

314
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,663
l need a hot bath and a good meal.

315
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,773
You're in luck. They'll be bringing
the hay round any minute.

316
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:36,277
- l'm to eat hay?
- Aye, and sweet crunchy oats, too.

317
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,541
Oh, that changes everything.

318
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:45,145
l'm beginning to see
why they call you Thunder.

319
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:51,184
- Never mind. Where's the bathroom?
- You're standing on it!

320
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,069
Did Mrs Fairgood make him
go to the zoo?

321
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:02,933
- Where did he sleep?
- How did you smuggle him?

322
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,167
Darwin decided...
l mean, it was easy.

323
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:09,175
Hiding him from Sarah,
that's a different story.

324
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,713
Miss Sarah Wellington thinks
she's the bee's knees!

325
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,717
Why would you ever come here,
where it's so boring?

326
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:22,223
l got into trouble. l snuck out...
There were poachers hunting...

327
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,225
- Poachers?
- With guns?

328
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,261
Go on, Eliza.

329
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:33,097
There were three cheetah cubs
l knew. Like kittens, only wild.

330
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,603
We were running
when we heard shots.

331
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,175
A man dropped from a helicopter
on a ladder and...

332
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,437
...grabbed the one l named Tally.

333
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:47,516
l tried to save him,
but they cut the ladder and...l fell.

334
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,550
Tally was gone.

335
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,654
Poor Tally.

336
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,314
l think he's alive. l just feel it.

337
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,054
This is terrible!
Can't we write letters or something?

338
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,995
- Let's have a bake sale!
- Let us help!

339
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,896
Thanks, but...

340
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,435
What's going on in my room?

341
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,735
Sarah, Eliza was just telling us
the most awful story

342
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,741
about...Tally.

343
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,107
Never mind.

344
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,716
l've been filling out a report
and am quite tired.

345
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,252
- You'll all have to go.
- Goodnight, Eliza.

346
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,888
Goodnight, Sarah.

347
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,422
'Night, you guys!

348
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,190
l still can't believe you harboured
a wild animal in my room...

349
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,864
There are peas in my bed!

350
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,258
Tally? Tally!

351
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:11,401
Tally! l knew you were alive.

352
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,005
Eliza, help me!

353
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,766
Tally?

354
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,711
Tally!

355
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:34,417
l gave you this gift
for a reason, Eliza.

356
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,424
Shaman Mnyambo?

357
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,722
You must not waste time.

358
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,391
You must go to your destiny. Go!

359
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,129
What do you mean?
Where am l supposed to go?

360
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,897
Shaman?

361
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:54,238
Tally is alive. Go save him, Eliza.

362
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,709
Go! Go!

363
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,677
Shaman Mnyambo's right.

364
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,857
l have to go.

365
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,189
What are you doing?

366
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,631
l have to leave.

367
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:24,638
- l'm calling Mrs Fairgood.
- No! You have to keep this a secret.

368
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:28,369
Do you have a credit card
for tickets to Africa?

369
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,776
- l won't do this.
- My parents will pay you back.

370
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,885
- No one will know until it's all over.
- What's over?

371
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,488
You're acting so odd.
l'm reporting you at once.

372
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,024
Sarah, please, it's a matter
of life and death.

373
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,721
l have to go now
and l really need your help. Please!

374
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,891
Just think, you'll get the room
all to yourself again.

375
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,530
Would you prefer aisle or window?

376
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,102
Darwin, wake up!

377
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,904
What?

378
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:07,244
l've tried to keep track of the days,
but they've blurred into months!

379
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,285
Dar, it's only been four hours.

380
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,427
lt's certainly better than riding
in the hold, but l don't understand...

381
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,930
Shh! l'll tell you
after the plane takes off.

382
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,602
Fine!

383
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,964
Shh! Stop fidgeting!

384
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,266
l can't help it, l've got hay in my skirt.

385
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,506
She has that hairy disease.

386
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,674
We're going to see
a special doctor in Nairobi.

387
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,346
l'll find you, Tally.

388
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,549
l promise.

389
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:08,422
We'll be gone until after the eclipse.
Will you be all right with Donnie?

390
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,732
This will be the highlight
of my young life!

391
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,064
That's the spirit, Poodles!

392
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:20,301
Dad, have you completely lost
your ability to recognise sarcasm?

393
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,706
l'm not sure l ever had it.

394
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:28,546
Stay close to camp. lf you're lucky,
you might see a hyena roving about!

395
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,086
Excuse me, while l go find
a container for my joy.

396
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,259
Very well, we'll wait right here.

397
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,792
Oh...that's sarcasm, isn't it?

398
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:42,227
You do that rather frequently,
don't you?

399
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,597
Debbie, just how long
is this sulking going to go on?

400
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,240
Another 35-40 minutes.
Then l'll start up again tomorrow.

401
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,672
Get some rest.
l know it must be draining.

402
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,507
We'll call you on the short wave.

403
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,878
Be careful. And have a good time!

404
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,179
No problem.
l'll take the Congo-Com for a spin.

405
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,049
Absolutely not!

406
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,589
But do have fun!

407
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,929
That is so wrong.

408
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:29,674
Help! The poachers...
l've been shot!

409
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,815
- Darwin, get up.
- What?

410
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,582
Excuse me...

411
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,963
A rhino's been shot.
You have to let me off this train!

412
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,155
Hang on, we'll get help.
You'll be OK.

413
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,318
They shot me...at the river.

414
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,260
They were trying to take my horn,

415
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,026
when l ran away.

416
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,339
Help! Help!

417
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,244
Please help me!
This rhino's been shot!

418
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,883
- Hold this, right here.
- ls he still alive?

419
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,348
Barely. But l think l can save him.

420
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:47,513
You're a very brave young lady.
We saw you jump from that train.

421
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,558
l had to save this rhino...

422
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:55,463
That's the knife from the man
who took Tally.

423
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,295
- Keep applying pressure.
- Sorry, l just...

424
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:05,100
- Thank goodness, the authorities.
- What happened here?

425
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,710
Poachers shot him at the river.
Find them.

426
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,143
They took a cheetah cub.

427
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,580
l recognised their knife.
Call Jomo Mbelie!

428
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,653
- You know Jomo?
- Yes, he's friends with my father.

429
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,416
Tell him Eliza found the knife.

430
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,617
We were just at the river,
there were no poachers.

431
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:29,960
l'm Sloan Blackburn. We're studying
the endangered wildlife.

432
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,730
We have to get this poor guy
to our camp.

433
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,067
My wife, Bree.
She's a wildlife veterinarian.

434
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,073
We'll take him to the rhino sanctuary.

435
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,344
Eliza, they'll take care of him,
don't worry.

436
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:58,227
Can we give you a lift? You shouldn't
be alone with poachers around.

437
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,989
No, thanks. Our camp's not too far.

438
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:05,362
We have to get back to our work,
but l hope we see you again.

439
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,434
Me, too.

440
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,266
Thanks for your help. Bye!

441
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,772
Come on.
We have to find those poachers.

442
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:19,678
We have to find your parents.
You saw what those poachers did.

443
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,910
- But if they're nearby, Tally is, too.
- No!

444
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,523
lf those awful people see you again,
they'll hurt you.

445
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,161
And l'm not going to let that happen.

446
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:35,856
You're right, Darwin.
We can't do this alone.

447
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,534
Hurry, we'll find my parents' camp.

448
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,796
lt's not far, is it?

449
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,975
We'll get there...by morning.

450
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:52,443
l wish we'd never left school.
Thunder said there'd be days like this.

451
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:07,657
This dude Jack plants these
magic beans, 'cause he's hungry.

452
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:12,928
Then, a mondo beanstalk
grows way up into the clouds.

453
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,436
Bushbabies! How annoying!

454
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,612
Jack, who's totally buff,
climbs up the beanstalk

455
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:27,580
and finds a golden goose,
a golden harp and a big, scary...

456
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,444
...giant?

457
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:35,591
Donnie?

458
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,690
Donnie!

459
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,630
Donnie! Donnie!

460
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,173
Radcliffe! You never told me
how to land!

461
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,111
- Grandmumsy?
- lt's all in the knees, Cordy!

462
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,684
- Colonel?
- You're looking well, Deborah!

463
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,688
Do we have a kiss for Grandpapa?

464
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,792
l knew l shouldn't have brought
the good china!

465
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:23,440
Debbie, dreadful news.
Your sister has run away from school.

466
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,372
Under cover of night...with Darwin!

467
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:32,106
Excuse me, did you say
the monkey got to go to London?

468
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,375
Debbie, are you there? Over.

469
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:38,112
- Guess who's here?
- Don't alarm your parents.

470
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:42,452
She means there's no need
for Marianne to blame her

471
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,390
a minute earlier than necessary!

472
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,029
Sorry.

473
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,998
Eliza was seen boarding a train
for the Congo. We'll take her back.

474
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,000
Debbie! Who's there?

475
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,469
Some cute bushbabies!

476
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,042
Did l just hear you call
a wild animal ''cute''?

477
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:05,443
That's called sarcasm, dearest.

478
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:16,392
Sure, you can ride with us.
My owner will never know.

479
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,169
How did l end up here...
amongst chickens?

480
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:55,928
Donnie, this may look like
a shark cage, but it's a playpen.

481
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:01,127
lt's where nice little boys play, when
their sisters want peace and quiet.

482
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,040
Hey, Donnie!

483
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:13,308
lf it isn't the boarding school dropout
and her sidekick, Chimp-o!

484
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:17,112
- l need to talk to Mom and Dad.
- They're not here.

485
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,687
Talk to me and pretend l'm listening.

486
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,586
- Where are they?
- ln the jungle, filming.

487
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:26,092
- But the eclipse isn't until tomorrow.
- Whatever.

488
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,060
Fine. l'll call them on the radio.

489
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,167
Don't go in there.

490
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:39,240
- What are they doing here?
- Taking you back to England.

491
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:44,176
l'm not going back.
l came back to find Tally.

492
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,748
- l just need Dad's help.
- What's wrong with you?

493
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,886
You finally get a chance
to escape our jail,

494
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,524
instead you come back
like some freaky homing pigeon,

495
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:58,252
and wreck my chance
of ever getting out of this place.

496
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,762
l am not going to slow dance
at my prom with some baboon!

497
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:07,699
Debbie, leave me alone!
You're not going to stop me!

498
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,770
Yes, l am!

499
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,531
Debbie, no!

500
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,337
Hey! Let me out of here!

501
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,608
Sorry, Deb.
Take it up with the warden.

502
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:26,679
Donnie! Bring me the key
like a nice little animal boy!

503
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,819
Donnie!

504
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,506
Cordy! lt's the blitz!

505
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,942
You're dreaming, Raddie.
England is safe.

506
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,585
When l get my hands
on that ungrateful,

507
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,416
trouble-making, know-it-all sister...

508
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,934
Wow! lf l weren't so mad,
this would totally rock!

509
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,604
Oh, man! Hello?

510
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,970
Both of my daughters are missing?

511
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:25,512
The good news is the chimpanzee
turned up in England.

512
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:29,618
But never mind that now.
Debbie left a note:

513
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,278
''Don't freak.''
That's Deborah talking, not l.

514
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,790
''Took the Congo-Com
to find Donnie who followed Eliza.

515
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,123
''She's going to some valley.
Later, Debbie.''

516
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,959
My children are in the jungle alone?

517
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:48,161
We'll find them, lovely.
Dad, are you there?

518
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,706
- Right here, my boy.
- You'll have to pick us up downriver.

519
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,971
l'll give you our coordinates.
Can you triangulate a position?

520
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,379
They didn't call me Colonel
for my chicken recipe!

521
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,212
Fire away!

522
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,385
l'm driving around this sweaty jungle,
looking for my sister,

523
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:15,327
when l could be watching part two
of Before They Were Teens.

524
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,227
Who smells?

525
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,928
lt's completely overpowering
my vanilla-ginger body splash.

526
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,145
Donnie!

527
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,723
Donnie?

528
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,915
Donnie!

529
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,698
Does this...human...
belong to anyone?

530
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,266
Thanks. Hope he wasn't any trouble.

531
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,027
Not really.

532
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,832
But tell him when a gorilla is sleeping,

533
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,703
he doesn't want a dung-beetle
shoved up his nose!

534
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,372
We're hoping it's just a phase.

535
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,379
l'm looking for my parents,

536
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,212
two people on the way
to Tembo Valley?

537
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,516
Two people?
Riding in those loud whirlybirds?

538
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,559
- Do you mean helicopters?
- lt might be the poachers!

539
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,629
Did you see them
with a cheetah cub?

540
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,596
l saw the whirlybirds land
on the ground,

541
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:28,396
and then people putting a fence
across the valley.

542
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,732
A fence? What for?

543
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,707
Something's up. What's the quickest
way to the valley?

544
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,676
Follow the river. Be careful.

545
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,576
Dar, get Donnie.

546
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,082
Donnie, this is no time
for your games!

547
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:51,584
Don't force it, chimp.
lt'll come out in its own good time.

548
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:58,933
As many as a thousand elephants
will converge during the eclipse.

549
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:04,904
My desire to witness a natural marvel
might have influenced Eliza.

550
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,474
She must've decided not to miss it.

551
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:11,614
She wouldn't come all the way
from London just for that.

552
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,648
There's something else going on.

553
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:20,756
- l'm just afraid she'll get hurt.
- She'll be fine. They all will.

554
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,687
How do you know?

555
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,420
And don't say,
''Because they're Thornberrys.''

556
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,329
Because they've been raised by you.
And quite wonderfully, l might add.

557
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,469
Radcliffe is right.

558
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,639
Now, let's find them.

559
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,376
Eliza! Donnie!

560
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:53,522
l have had enough of this!
l am not in the mood!

561
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,693
Great! l'm turning into Mom!

562
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:03,027
Where are the lights
on this stupid thing?

563
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,162
Get outta here, pork chops!

564
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,741
Hi...thanks.

565
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:52,438
l don't normally look this bad,
just so you know.

566
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:58,588
Have you seen a dorky girl with braces
and a monkey and a wild boy?

567
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,223
Sorry, l do not understand.

568
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,689
l know. l don't get it either.

569
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,523
You have no idea what kind of day
l've been having.

570
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,063
My name is Boko.

571
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:14,704
Oh, sorry, that was rude.
l'm Debbie.

572
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:20,901
Boko, you don't have a pre-moistened
towelette on you by chance?

573
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,239
Who is that girl?
Why did she drive into the mud?

574
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,178
We have to help her.

575
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,080
Oh...no one speaks English.

576
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,090
l am so grounded.

577
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,423
Look! A campfire!

578
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,119
lt must be my parents!

579
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,766
Mom! Dad!

580
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,766
Bree? Sloan?

581
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,598
Eliza? What are you doing out here?

582
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,537
The poachers are here.
They put up a fence in Tembo Valley.

583
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:59,010
- Really? Did you see them?
- No...l mean, yes, l saw them.

584
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:03,448
l have to find my parents.
They're filming the elephants.

585
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:07,214
That's why we're here, too,
to count the elephants.

586
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:12,691
- lf we can find any, of course.
- Yeah...they're really hard to find.

587
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,525
- They only... Oh, no.
- What's wrong?

588
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:20,669
They stay in the forest
except during the eclipse.

589
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:24,932
The poachers must've heard the legend.
They're after the elephants!

590
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,009
- What?
- They're planning to catch them.

591
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:34,116
They'll be a thousand out in the open.
We must call Jomo right away!

592
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,682
- No signal. Of all times!
- Can't you fix it?

593
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:43,258
Guys, let's stay calm.
We can't do anything about it tonight.

594
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,396
Tomorrow, we'll find Eliza's parents
and use their radio.

595
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:51,863
The poachers won't go
after the elephants before the eclipse.

596
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:56,300
But l'm worried about Tally,
the cheetah cub l told you about.

597
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,636
Eliza, it's dark.
No sense getting lost in the jungle.

598
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,644
l won't get lost.
Donnie, get back here!

599
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:09,444
l wouldn't want you to go in there
and make a mess.

600
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:17,159
You and your chimp and
your little brother can sleep right here.

601
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,775
l'd look so hot in this.

602
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,223
You must be hungry. Here.

603
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,130
Thanks. l'm starving.

604
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:07,309
- What kind of cereal is this?
- We get our food from over there.

605
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,247
Delicious!

606
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:17,147
Oh, thank you!

607
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,345
My soda!

608
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,824
Sorry. Do you want some?

609
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:25,119
Thank you.

610
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,200
Delicious.

611
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,839
l'm late for the whole
''finding my sister'' thing.

612
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:44,503
- Why is your jewellery so loud?
- Pretty cool, huh? lt's waterproof, too.

613
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,683
Why don't you keep it?

614
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,352
Are you giving this to me?

615
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,148
Thanks for the skirt.
You did give me this?

616
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:58,123
- Boko give Debbie?
- Debbie give Boko?

617
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,764
Yeah! l'm so good
at this communication stuff!

618
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,427
l'll be fine, really.
l know exactly where l'm going.

619
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,368
Bye! Bye, Boko!

620
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,676
Who put that vine there?

621
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,411
Bye, again! Bye!

622
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,608
Really, l'm leaving now.

623
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:46,035
Hi, again.
l'm just a little turned around.

624
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:59,479
- Debbie!
- Boko, you can't come with me.

625
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,887
lt's not that l don't like you.
And it's not about the height thing.

626
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,995
l can't drag you into this family drama.

627
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:13,329
l have to find my sister, and believe me,
she is good at this jungle stuff.

628
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,834
You think this'll fit?

629
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:27,179
Donnie's gone. We need to find him.
The eclipse is in a few hours.

630
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:32,219
But Donnie's always missing, and
l was dreaming about shepherd's pie.

631
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:36,882
Bree! Sloan! Have you seen Donnie?

632
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,961
Donnie? Sloan told you
to stay out of there.

633
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,962
Bree? Sloan?

634
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:50,135
What is all this?

635
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:57,973
l don't like this place.
We've got Donnie, now let's go.

636
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,149
What's that?

637
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:03,615
Something's in there.

638
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,454
Tally?

639
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,623
Don't worry, l'll get you out of there.

640
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:16,128
- Eliza!
- Oh, Tally!

641
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,637
- l knew l'd find you.
- Eliza, we have to get out of here.

642
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:26,969
- What do you mean?
- Hello, Eliza.

643
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,977
This cheetah cub...
Where did you get him?

644
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:35,675
- l picked him up on the savannah.
- You bought him?

645
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,685
No. l picked him up...
right off the ground.

646
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,290
l told Sloan he shouldn't cut
that rope ladder.

647
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,017
lt was you!

648
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:49,756
Yes. Thank you so much
for returning my knife to me.

649
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:53,925
Oh, kitten.
You didn't drink all your milk.

650
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,370
How are you going to grow
big enough to make me a coat?

651
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:04,639
You'll have to miss the solar eclipse.
Catch it on the Poaching Channel!

652
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,782
You built the fence!

653
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:11,579
Of course. Now here's a question
for your famous father.

654
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:19,194
How many volts of electricity does
it take to kill a thousand elephants?

655
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,762
Then, my brat sister ran away
from boarding school

656
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:27,926
without any consideration for me,
after all l've done for her.

657
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:31,368
- Stop! l see something!
- You say something?

658
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:35,340
lf it was just Eliza,
l'd say, ''Go play in the jungle!''

659
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:40,346
But l am responsible for Donnie,
and l take that very seriously.

660
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,177
Debbie!

661
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,247
l don't see anything.

662
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:52,794
Brat sister.

663
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,089
Wow! You're good.

664
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:59,166
Maybe we can make it
to Tembo Valley before lunchtime.

665
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,066
- Tembo Valley?
- Yeah. You know it?

666
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,237
Eliza, you're a little troublemaker.

667
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:12,608
First, you show up on my cheetah hunt,
then save my rhino.

668
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:16,546
- He's not your rhino!
- Oh, really?

669
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,847
You knew the poachers
had shot him at the river.

670
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,184
- Yet you were on a train at the time.
- l guessed.

671
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,860
Perhaps.

672
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:30,693
Now you arrive here, knowing about
a fence no one witnessed being built.

673
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,030
So, my little troublemaker,
who told you?

674
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,967
No one.

675
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:41,166
- Are your parents working with Jomo?
- They don't know l'm here.

676
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,437
- Who's your source of information?
- No one!

677
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,377
You know too much for a little girl.

678
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:52,351
l've too much invested in this
to let anything get in my way.

679
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:57,720
lf you don't tell me who they are,
you'll never see your family again!

680
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,555
Sloan, l hear someone coming.

681
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:06,360
What's going on? l don't like him!

682
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,300
l saw them with firesticks
and there was a loud sound.

683
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,600
Explosives?
We've got to get out of here.

684
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,041
- l'll help!
- Go, Tally, that's it!

685
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,908
Yes, get the cheetah involved again!

686
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,846
They got us into this mess.

687
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,714
- Don't blame Tally.
- l'm not.

688
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,050
Tally didn't sneak out
or run away from school,

689
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,818
or trust people who don't like animals!

690
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:36,863
- l thought they were like me.
- Can't you see no one's like you?

691
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:42,663
- The Shaman gave you a gift. Use it!
- Darwin, please!

692
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:47,707
l think you don't know
what to do with your powers!

693
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:52,108
For once in your life, just be quiet!

694
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:56,844
- Hi, can we help you?
- Yes.

695
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,453
l'm looking for my sister,
Eliza Thornberry.

696
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,251
- Debbie.
- Debbie!

697
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,866
Let me go, you creep!

698
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:17,269
- Let her go!
- Certainly.

699
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:20,135
lf you tell me
who's your source of information.

700
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,712
There's no one.
l just guessed all of that stuff.

701
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:27,144
The fence and the explosives.

702
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,217
l never mentioned explosives!
You're lying!

703
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,650
What's he talking about?

704
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,814
- Tell me, or she goes over the edge.
- Get rid of her.

705
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:42,157
- She doesn't know anything about this.
- Who told you these things?

706
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,061
- l can't tell you.
- Eliza!

707
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:48,669
Stop! Wait! l'll tell you!

708
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,840
l know these things because...

709
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,568
...l can talk to animals.

710
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,042
What has she done?

711
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,428
Sloan, let's get out of here!

712
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,966
Debbie!

713
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,902
Boko!

714
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,609
Please be all right.

715
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,915
Debbie, run into the woods!

716
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,523
- Where are you going?
- l have to get Tally.

717
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,317
Darwin, come on!

718
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,499
lt's really gone.

719
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,428
You expect me to believe
you freed a warthog

720
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,861
who was a magic man
who let you talk to animals,

721
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:30,301
but you had to keep it secret
or you'd lose your powers?

722
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,339
Well...yeah.

723
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:38,242
l knew it! That's why you're always
sneaking out with Darwin!

724
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:42,406
Tell that monkey that
l don't appreciate it

725
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:46,611
when he leaves pizza crusts
under the seat cushions. Tell him!

726
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,587
Debbie, l broke the rule.

727
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:55,162
l told about my powers...
so l lost them.

728
01:03:55,364 --> 01:04:00,301
Oh, my gosh! You did that for me?

729
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,063
l can't talk to Darwin any more.

730
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,639
And the last thing l said to him
was really mean.

731
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,244
Now l can't even tell him l'm sorry.

732
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,543
Eliza, l may not speak monkey,

733
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,153
but l think he's trying to tell us
about that waterfall!

734
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:30,855
We're here.
This must be the Tembo Valley.

735
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:43,402
Come on!
The eclipse is going to start soon.

736
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:58,088
- What happened?
- We have to get out of here.

737
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:04,530
Wow! Darwin really
watches out for you, doesn't he?

738
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,067
Yeah...he's my best friend.

739
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,400
The elephants!

740
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,387
lt's a trap.

741
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,720
They're all going to die,
and l can't warn them.

742
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,956
But can't you make elephant noises
or something?

743
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,967
l can't talk to them. How can
l help them? You don't understand!

744
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:47,609
Shaman Mnyambo told me
that he gave me my gift for a reason.

745
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,108
lt doesn't matter now.

746
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,406
l lost it.

747
01:05:55,818 --> 01:06:01,757
OK, enough with the ''poor me'' bit.
Are you just going to sit there?

748
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,325
What can l do?
l'm just an ordinary girl now.

749
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:11,558
Since you were little, you dragged
home birds with broken wings.

750
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:15,259
You didn't have special powers then!
You just...cared.

751
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,430
Trust me, you were never ordinary.

752
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:31,483
Bree, take us into the valley,
l want to watch this.

753
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:38,115
Everyone, take your places!
lt must happen within seven minutes.

754
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:46,060
- Do you see the girls or Donnie?
- No. But, Nigel...

755
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,169
...what do you make of that?

756
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:52,034
Poachers!
They're setting up explosives.

757
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,075
They're going to frighten
the elephants into stampeding,

758
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,213
right into that electric fence!

759
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:02,384
Marianne, take us down there.

760
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,554
Eliza, no! They'll stomp on you.

761
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,848
No, they won't.

762
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,390
Elephants know
when you're trying to help them.

763
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:15,325
- lt's not too late to become ordinary!
- Debbie!

764
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,896
Boko!

765
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,067
Think this'll fit?

766
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,147
Stay here, l'll be back.

767
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:40,584
l have to stop them somehow,
make them turn around.

768
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:49,425
Turn around! You have to go back!

769
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,380
l've got to get to the front of the herd.

770
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,319
Set off the first round
of explosives now!

771
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,427
The wires have been cut.

772
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,826
Set off the second round!

773
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:06,130
Think of something quick!
Think of something!

774
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,357
Please! Stop!

775
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,567
lt worked!

776
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,034
Oh, no!

777
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:46,506
How can l make you understand me?
What did Phaedra tell me?

778
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:49,684
Behind the ear!

779
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,529
We did it!

780
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:07,702
Let's get out of here.

781
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:17,876
- They're turning! Start shooting!
- But there's a girl there.

782
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,278
l don't care! Take down the elephants!
l'll take care of the kid.

783
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:26,011
lt's all right, we're almost out of here.

784
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:35,652
- You will regret this.
- l don't care!

785
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,492
What you're doing is awful!

786
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,693
And what you're doing is stupid!

787
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:46,204
Shame you won't be here
to help me carry out the ivory.

788
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,312
Oh, no!

789
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,986
l can't get a shot from here. Go lower!

790
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,440
Eliza!

791
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,834
Shaman Mnyambo, l'm sorry.

792
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:51,302
l messed everything up.
l couldn't make them understand.

793
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:55,603
lf l hadn't broken the rule,
l could have saved them.

794
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,302
But you did save them.

795
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,345
See for yourself.

796
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,350
And you did this not with your gift,
but with your heart.

797
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:13,619
lf you can do this
without your powers,

798
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,287
you have a greater destiny
than l've even known.

799
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,229
l'm going to grant you
your powers back.

800
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,496
You are? Really?

801
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,236
There is one condition.

802
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:36,510
About your sister...
how well can she keep a secret?

803
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,758
Don't move! You're under arrest!

804
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:02,108
Take your hands off me!
We were trying to help the elephants.

805
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,539
Need a ride?

806
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:14,045
- Brat sister.
- l don't know where he got that.

807
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,554
Debbie, stop! There's Darwin!

808
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:22,428
l know you think l talk too much.
So from now on, l'll quietly observe...

809
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,794
- Yeah. Like that'll ever happen.
- Eliza?

810
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:28,902
Did you just talk to me?

811
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,976
- Mom! Dad!
- Eliza!

812
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:36,906
Poppet!

813
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,572
You're going back to your family?

814
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,211
Yeah.

815
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:49,983
Oh, please, keep it.
You know...friend?

816
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,562
Friend.

817
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:12,806
Pretty amazing, huh, Dad?
The legend was right.

818
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,505
lt was, indeed.

819
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:19,517
But l still wonder
why they gather during an eclipse.

820
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,349
Maybe the elephants feel safe.

821
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,583
- Safe?
- Yeah.

822
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:29,730
Maybe because it's the one day
that everything changes.

823
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:34,733
The little moon blocks
the powerful sun, so maybe...

824
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,872
...maybe they have reason to hope.

825
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:43,204
Maybe these intelligent creatures
believe that by standing together,

826
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:45,642
as they have done for centuries,

827
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:51,809
they may one day live
without fear of man's greed.

828
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:12,307
l don't know, of course,
but l swear she's thanking you.

829
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:16,605
l think so, too, Dad.

830
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:27,553
- Tally, do you see her anywhere?
- This is where we always played.

831
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,951
We'll find her.

832
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,524
Mom!

833
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,256
Tally? Tally!

834
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,095
Mom, l'm back!

835
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,635
Oh, my baby.

836
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,268
l thought l'd lost you.

837
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:51,537
Akela, l should have listened to you.
l'm so sorry.

838
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:56,116
l know you are.
Tally's home now and safe.

839
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,047
Thank you.

840
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,448
You're welcome.

841
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:05,650
Eliza! Cut the cheetah chatter
and let's go!

842
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,058
- l gotta go.
- Bye, Eliza.

843
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,290
l'll miss you guys. See you next time.

844
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,772
How am l gonna keep your secret?

845
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:25,139
Well, you have to.

846
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:29,215
l agreed to a condition
when l got my powers back.

847
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:34,515
You can never tell anyone my secret,
because if you do...

848
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,248
...you'll turn into a baboon.

849
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,926
A baboon?!

850
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,027
The peacefulness
of this congregation...

851
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:46,565
l am not going to spend
the rest of my life with a purple butt!

852
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,531
Cut!

853
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:54,059
These furless primates
you see behind me are part

854
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:58,729
of an untamed sub-species
best known as...

855
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,568
...the Thornberrys.

856
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:39,939
lf you leap awake

857
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:44,676
ln the mirror of a bad dream

858
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,089
And for a fraction of a second

859
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,751
You can't remember where you are

860
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,362
Just open your window

861
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:03,937
And follow your memory upstream

862
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:07,065
To the meadow in the mountain

863
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:11,837
Where we counted every falling star

864
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,543
l believe the light that shines on you

865
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:20,813
Will shine on you forever

866
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:22,683
Forever

867
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,984
And though l can't guarantee

868
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:29,960
There's nothing scary
hiding under your bed

869
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,460
l'm gonna stand guard

870
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:39,003
Like a postcard
of a Golden Retriever

871
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,410
And never leave till l leave you

872
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:48,072
With a sweet dream in your head

873
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,387
l'm gonna watch you shine

874
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,614
Gonna watch you grow

875
01:19:56,825 --> 01:20:01,228
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know

876
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:05,627
As long as one and one is two

877
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,634
There could never be a father

878
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:15,242
Loved his daughter
more than l love you

879
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,384
Trust your intuition

880
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:26,577
lt's just like going fishing

881
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:32,249
You cast your line
and hope you get a bite

882
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:40,292
But you don't need
to waste your time

883
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:44,871
Worrying about the market place
Try to help the human race

884
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:50,875
Struggling to survive
its harshest night

885
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,751
l'm gonna watch you shine

886
01:20:57,953 --> 01:20:59,944
Gonna watch you grow

887
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:04,558
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know

888
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:09,526
As long as one and one is two

889
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,030
There could never be a father

890
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:18,605
Loved his daughter
more than l love you

891
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:43,063
l'm gonna watch you shine

892
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,290
Gonna watch you grow

893
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:49,800
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know

894
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:54,840
As long as one and one is two

895
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,273
There could never be a father

896
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:03,941
Loved his daughter
more than l love you

897
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:34,413
Here on earth

898
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:43,385
Are the stars so far away?

899
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:50,292
Do they hear us crying?

900
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:57,199
Can they feel us when we pray?

901
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:04,140
Can we trust
And go where it takes us?

902
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,008
Do we choose?

903
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:10,446
Sometimes l wonder

904
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:17,216
Do we create our destiny?

905
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,792
Dreamers like you

906
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,193
Dreamers like me

907
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:31,202
We have the power in our hearts

908
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:40,178
Love is our bridge to the stars

909
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:38,470
You could be so happy

910
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,937
On this brand new beautiful day

911
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:44,600
You could be so happy

912
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:47,509
Like kids getting ready to play

913
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:56,649
You could be so happy

914
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:00,259
lf you got somebody to love

915
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,230
