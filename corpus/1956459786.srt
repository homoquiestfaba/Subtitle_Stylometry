cold case now, Mr. Craven?

1082
01:21:18,812 --> 01:21:20,347
I can't comment about
that at this time.

1083
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:21,748
Our office is not
ready to release

1084
01:21:21,748 --> 01:21:23,183
any information about
the case till there's

1085
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:24,218
been a full review.

1086
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,420
What can you tell us
about the videotapes?

1087
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,621
I can't comment.

1088
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:28,956
But the people who
have seen the tapes

1089
01:21:28,956 --> 01:21:30,424
have identified many
of the people involved.

1090
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:31,592
What are you saying about that?

1091
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:33,627
I, uh-- can't comment.

1092
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:34,828
Well, what about
Fletcher Ross?

1093
01:21:34,828 --> 01:21:35,529
Judge Keaton?

1094
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:36,663
Members of the
police department?

1095
01:21:36,663 --> 01:21:38,699
- No comment.
- What about the black book?

1096
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:39,466
No comment.

1097
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:41,768
Mr. Craven, these people
are witnesses to a crime.

1098
01:21:41,768 --> 01:21:43,770
And under state law, their
names have to be made public.

1099
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,138
Are you aware of that?

1100
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:46,406
Wait a minute.

1101
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:47,941
What crime?

1102
01:21:47,941 --> 01:21:50,410
Mr. Van Horn, as
the Coles' attorney,

1103
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:51,812
should be well
aware of the charges

1104
01:21:51,812 --> 01:21:56,049
being brought against them--
prostitution and extortion.

1105
01:21:56,049 --> 01:22:00,420
There is no
prostitution, no extortion,

1106
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,656
no crime of any kind.

1107
01:22:02,656 --> 01:22:04,691
What about the videotapes?

1108
01:22:04,691 --> 01:22:07,127
OK, I'll come to that.

1109
01:22:07,127 --> 01:22:09,029
What about the black book?

1110
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:10,898
I'll answer all
your questions.

1111
01:22:10,898 --> 01:22:14,801
Just give me a chance
to tell the truth.

1112
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:19,540
What has been characterized as
a crime perpetrated by the Coles

1113
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,708
is actually a tragedy.

1114
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,310
What has been
called perverseness

1115
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,646
is, underneath all
the tar and feathers,

1116
01:22:25,646 --> 01:22:29,783
really a love story,
pure and simple.

1117
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:34,288
What we have here is a loving
couple, compatible in every way

1118
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:36,056
except in the bedroom.

1119
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:40,360
Joanne Cole suffers from
excessive sexual desires,

1120
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,830
nymphomania, a
medical condition,

1121
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:47,134
induced and exacerbated by
the use of the drug Primac,

1122
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:51,805
which was prescribed to
her by a medical doctor.

1123
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:54,508
Because of the deep love
that this couple felt for one

1124
01:22:54,508 --> 01:22:58,011
another, they dealt
with this blow

1125
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:02,950
to their marital stability
in a sane and rational way,

1126
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:04,985
accommodation.

1127
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:07,154
If this had been
a wasting illness,

1128
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:10,991
David Cole would be praised for
supporting his wife's needs.

1129
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,726
He would have been
called a hero,

1130
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,661
and she would have been a saint.

1131
01:23:14,661 --> 01:23:19,900
She took her treatment, had
therapy, in a safe environment,

1132
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,936
a clinical environment,
entirely under the supervision

1133
01:23:22,936 --> 01:23:24,705
of her husband.

1134
01:23:24,705 --> 01:23:28,308
They needed and
depended on one another

1135
01:23:28,308 --> 01:23:30,611
because they loved each other.

1136
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:33,046
There's a black book
with names and dates

1137
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:35,415
and dollar amounts,
heaps of videos

1138
01:23:35,415 --> 01:23:37,251
of judges, politicians,
and lawyers

1139
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:38,452
in bed with your client.

1140
01:23:38,452 --> 01:23:41,221
How does all this square
with your therapy defense?

1141
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:44,124
These other people, their
names, their prestige,

1142
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:47,060
were irrelevant to the Coles.

1143
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:51,732
The camera was David's way of
assessing his wife's condition.

1144
01:23:51,732 --> 01:23:54,501
It was as clinical as
an X-ray or an MRI.

1145
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:01,208
Look, I hope that everybody
who hears the Coles' story

1146
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,343
will recognize the
commonality of it

1147
01:24:03,343 --> 01:24:07,948
and perhaps related it to
travails in their own lives.

1148
01:24:07,948 --> 01:24:11,051
Then I think the public
will react generously--

1149
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:14,988
not just with sympathy
but with understanding.

1150
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:15,889
Mr. Van Horn--

1151
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:17,824
Mr. Van Horn, would
you like to comment?

1152

They sell T-shirts
with your picture on it,

1153
01:24:35,475 --> 01:24:36,844
you've been on radio
shows, you've been

1154
01:24:36,844 --> 01:24:41,081
on national television--
you're a celebrity now.

1155
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,283
It's incredible, isn't it?

1156
01:24:43,283 --> 01:24:44,918
Now that you've
accepted the plea bargain,

1157
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:48,422
are you going to put
all this behind you?

1158
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:49,523
No.

1159
01:24:49,523 --> 01:24:51,925
I think it will be kept
alive for a long time.

1160
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:54,928
FEMALE SPEAKER: Why?

1161
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:57,931
Because I think
it fulfills a need.

1162
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,400
I think a lot of people would
like to experience my story

1163
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,469
firsthand, but they can't.

1164
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:04,271
Or they won't.

1165
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:07,107
And so the more details
they hear, the more real

1166
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:10,344
the experience becomes to them.

1167
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:12,246
What about the videotapes?

1168
01:25:12,246 --> 01:25:14,715
Did Fletcher Ross's
resignation and withdrawal

1169
01:25:14,715 --> 01:25:18,552
from the mayor's race have
anything to do with you?

1170
01:25:18,552 --> 01:25:21,421
All I know is what his
statement said, that he had

1171
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:24,525
some sort of medical problem.

1172
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:27,661
Beyond that, I wouldn't presume
to comment on his motives.

1173
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:31,164
So what are your plans?

1174
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:36,803
Our plans?

1175
01:25:36,803 --> 01:25:39,806
We've had a lot of nice offers.

1176
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:43,010
I think we're going to go
to Barbados for a while.

1177
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:48,315
I think we'll work things out
on the beach, have some fun.

would you do it again?

I'd leave out a few things.

But overall, sure.

1185
01:26:09,336 --> 01:26:10,037
Which was?

you wanted to say?
