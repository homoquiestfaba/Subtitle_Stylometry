1
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,901
Dark Star November,
this is Gator 6. Return to base.

2
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,503
Dark Star November, this is
Gator 6. Return to base.

3
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,959
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

4
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,360
You look pale.
Everything okay?

5
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,070
Sean?

6
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,330
Sean?

7
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:58,903
Hey.

8
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,506
Anyway, listen.
I wanted to tell you.

9
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,412
- God damn it!
- The only reason why I canceled...

10
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,982
He's calling me
three times a day.

11
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,248
I hear more from him now than I did
when we were together.

12
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,514
What is it with guys?

13
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,395
I gave notice.

14
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,990
- Ticket?
- Notice?

15
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,432
May I see your ticket?

16
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,660
I, uh...

17
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,874
Hey. Hey.

18
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,415
You're acting a little strange
this morning. You okay?

19
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,419
- Ticket? - Are we gonna make up
the 10 minutes?

20
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,543
We're gonna try, sir.

21
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,455
Hey, Grandpa, what the heck
was the delay back there?

22
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,551
I just punch the tickets, sir.

23
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,624
I should punch your face.

24
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,955
Sean? Did I do something?

25
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,057
Look, I can see that you think you
know me, but I don't know who you are.

26
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,604
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.

27
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,300
I fly helicopters for the U.S. Army
in Afghanistan.

28
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,976
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

29
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,513
Sean, that's...

30
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,411
- Sean?
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

31
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,644
I feel sick.

32
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,321
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.

33
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,922
- Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.

34
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,688
Glenbrook Station.

35
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,566
Hey, mister!

36
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,871
- Hey!
- Glenbrook Station.

37
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,064
Hey!

38
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,731
You dropped this.

39
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,002
Thanks.

40
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,111
What is that?

41
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,213
Chicago.

42
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,690
All aboard.

43
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:55,220
Doors are closing.

44
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,468
This is a Chicago-bound train.

45
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,904
You okay there, Captain?

46
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,009
Next stop, Chicago.

47
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,754
Union Station.

48
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,119
Did you see that?

49
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,326
You're kind of freaking me out.

50
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,174
No.

51
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,776
No, no, no, no.

52
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,104
Are you all right?

53
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,272
I don't know what's going on.

54
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,436
Talk to me, Sean.

55
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,983
Look, I don't know who Sean is.
And I don't know who you are.

56
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,617
Okay. We'll get off
at the next stop.

57
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,518
We'll figure out
whatever's going on here, okay?

58
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,654
This doesn't belong to me.

59
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,425
Look at me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

60
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,951
Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.

61
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,282
Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.

62
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,952
Acknowledge transmission.

63
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,099
Captain Stevens, do you copy?

64
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,636
Where am I?

65
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,333
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
Are you functional?

66
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,080
I'm dizzy. Did I just A-lock?

67
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,341
Adjusting your rotation.

68
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,088
Can you report at this time?

69
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,485
What is this? What is this?

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,152
Where...

71
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,162
Who am I talking to?

72
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,788
Captain, report what you saw.

73
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,791
What? I don't understand.

74
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,665
Where were you
before you were talking to me?

75
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,772
There was an explosion.

76
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,967
Coming from where?

77
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,475
Some confusion is perfectly normal
at this stage, Captain.

78
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,008
Do you have a visual signal?

79
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:14,548
Who are you?

80
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,393
You already have that information,
Captain.

81
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,397
- I do?
- Recall my name.

82
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,439
We'll rebuild the pattern.
Try to focus.

83
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,547
I...

84
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,140
I was on a mission.

85
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,151
I was flying,

86
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,652
and then I woke up on a train.

87
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,722
And now I'm here.

88
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,821
I need to be briefed.

89
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,054
What unit is this?

90
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,527
You're with Beleaguered Castle.

91
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,821
Who?

92
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,059
Stand by for thread one
of alpha memory pattern.

93
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,965
What is Beleaguered Castle?

94
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,861
The exercises will assist you.

95
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,897
Memory thread one.

96
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,903
Listen to the following passage.

97
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,036
"Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and opera cloak.

98
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,276
In her hand
were five playing cards."

99
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,579
- Is this a joke?
- "They were,

100
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,586
the queen of spades,
four of clubs,

101
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,551
nine of clubs,

102
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,652
three of hearts,
nine of hearts."

103
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,524
- Is this a Red Flag exercise?
- End of thread one.

104
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,457
Thread two. The following is
a recording of a Western Screech Owl.

105
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,497
End of thread two.
End of pattern. Acknowledge.

106
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,733
Acknowledge end of pattern.

107
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,776
Stand by to initiate
pattern recall.

108
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,141
Go for pattern recall.

109
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,736
Arrange the five playing cards

110
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,715
in order of descending value,
irrespective of suit.

111
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,916
- Queen, two nines, four
and a three. - That is correct.

112
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,614
The passage I read contained
mention of a woman's name.

113
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,746
What was that name?

114
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,654
- Her name was Lilly.
- That is correct.

115
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,415
Recall my name.

116
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,794
Goodwin. Your name's Goodwin.

117
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,061
That is correct.
Welcome back, Captain.

118
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,115
Ma'am, I need to talk
to my father.

119
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,417
Has anybody been notified
that I'm stateside?

120
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,818
Who bombed the train, Captain?

121
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,715
What?

122
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,813
Who bombed the train?

123
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,516
A woman kept calling me Sean.

124
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,720
That is incidental.

125
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,328
Think, Captain. Remember back.

126
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,157
Who bombed the train?

127
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,291
I don't know who bombed
the goddamn train.

128
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,168
- Then go back and try again.
- Back where?

129
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,632
You will have eight minutes,
same as last time.

130
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,938
No, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?

131
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,375
I need to know where I am.

132
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,538
What is the location
and condition of my crew?

133
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,774
Does anybody know
that I'm stateside?

134
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,983
You are obligated
to give me this information.

135
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,178
Start with the bomb.

136
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,652
Where is it?
What does it look like?

137
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,651
What kind of explosive?
How is it detonated?

138
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,415
- Right.
- Find the bomb,

139
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,516
and you will find the bomber.

140
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,891
Find the bomb.
Wait, no, I...

141
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:21,213
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.

142
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:22,875
Okay. That's good.

143
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,179
And I signed up
for an LSAT course.

144
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,352
Next thing you know, I'll be moving
to India to find myself.

145
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,445
LSAT.

146
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,321
Know any good gurus?

147
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,423
She got your shoe.

148
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,593
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?

149
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,863
It's the same train,
but it's different.

150
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,899
Deep.

151
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,669
I hope it's different.
I feel the same way.

152
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,240
What?

153
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,579
- Do I have...
- Bryan.

154
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,518
What is it with guys? Everything's
more beautiful in retrospect.

155
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,050
What is...

156
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,921
This looks so real.

157
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,638
I think it's gonna be
really good for me

158
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,397
to get as far away from him
as possible.

159
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,658
Unbelievable detail.

160
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,257
Ticket? May I see your ticket?

161
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,736
They wouldn't put the doer
in front of me.

162
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,038
- The doer?
- You're the pretty girl.

163
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,878
- Ticket?
- The distraction.

164
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,779
- Distraction?
- Every sim has one.

165
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,114
Are we gonna make up
the 10 minutes?

166
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,313
- We are gonna try, sir.
- Are you talking about Bryan?

167
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,256
Hey, Grandpa, what the hell
was the delay back there?

168
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,217
- What are you late for?
- What?

169
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,492
You seem concerned about the time.
What are you late for?

170
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,534
I'm on my way to an asshole festival.
I hear you're headlining.

171
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,626
That's funny.
What are you, a comedian?

172
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,795
Yeah.

173
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,301
He is a comedian.

174
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,036
Sit down.

175
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,431
Freak.

176
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,574
Fans.

177
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,881
That's the guy.

178
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,577
He came in third on America's
Got Talent. Got cited twice for a DUI.

179
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,748
We talked about him.

180
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,847
- Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

181
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,620
Glenbrook Station.

182
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,991
Yeah, but by 1:00
the bridge is gonna be jammed.

183
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,323
Damn it!

184
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,763
I'm sorry.

185
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,961
Just let me get it, okay?

186
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,903
Hey, mister!

187
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,342
Hey!

188
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,505
Hey! You dropped this.

189
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,644
Thanks.

190
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,899
All aboard.

191
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,394
Doors are closing.

192
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,779
This is a Chicago-bound train.

193
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,085
The explosion came from behind me.

194
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,153
- What's with you? - I don't have time
to talk to you right now.

195
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,596
I got time for you.

196
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,531
Next stop, Chicago.

197
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,402
Union Station.

198
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,273
Holy shit.

199
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,528
Goodwin?

200
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,360
You gonna tell me
how to disarm this?

201
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,160
Uh...

202
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,403
Should I...

203
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,533
Unplug it? Or do you want me
to just leave it? Or...

204
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,643
Okay, um...

205
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,510
I'm just gonna leave it.

206
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,246
Okay?

207
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,287
I'll be late.

208
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,306
Ladies and gentlemen,
transit security.

209
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,976
- No, you're not.
- Due to a classified security breach,

210
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,418
I need all of you to turn off
any personal electronic devices

211
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,819
until we pull
into the station, okay?

212
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,253
That means laptops, cell phones.
Cell phone, sir? Cell phone, sir.

213
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,556
Thank you very much.
Pagers, anything electronic.

214
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,097
Thank you. It's just a precautionary
measure. Nothing to worry about.

215
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,664
So which is it? Security breach
or precautionary measure?

216
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,463
Sir? Sir.

217
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,897
Is there a problem here, sir?

218
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,406
- I'm in the middle of
a very big deal. - Sean?

219
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,943
- I need you to turn that off.
- Why don't you show me that ID again?

220
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,000
- Sean?
- Turn it off.

221
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,107
- Turn it off.
- What's your problem, asshole?

222
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,237
Hey!

223
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,445
Sean! What are you doing?

224
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,650
Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
Not a good idea.

225
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,513
That's not a good idea.

226
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,147
- I think you broke his jaw.
- It's okay.

227
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,384
He's not any more real
than you are.

228
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,858
I'm not real? How about next time
you drive to work?

229
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,122
Not gonna be a next time.

230
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,873
Stabilize.

231
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,086
Lower your pulse.

232
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,349
Did you find the bomb?

233
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,919
Yes.

234
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,299
There's hydraulic fluid
all over the floor.

235
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,268
It's not a concern, Captain.

236
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,102
- What is...
- Tell me about the bomb.

237
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,612
Where's that man? I saw a guy
with a crutch on the monitor.

238
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,115
He looks like he's in charge.
I want to talk to him.

239
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,343
That's irrelevant, Captain.

240
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,214
I want to talk
to your commanding officer!

241
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,514
You can talk to him upon completion
of your mission.

242
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.

243
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,890
I flew two goddamn sorties yesterday!

244
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,058
You've been with us
for two months.

245
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,668
Did you ID the bomber?

246
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,771
No. Where's my unit?

247
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,602
And under whose jurisdiction
is this simulation?

248
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,977
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.

249
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,771
What lives?

250
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,282
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.

251
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,684
No, no, no. What lives?
What are you talking about?

252
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,190
I need to be briefed.

253
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,368
Sir, I need to give him something.

254
00:18:58,737 --> 00:18:59,761
That's fine. Go ahead.

255
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,032
Okay.

256
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,704
Get ready to send him back in.

257
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,211
We're still waiting. Justin is trying
to do all the profiles right now.

258
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,078
At 7:48 this morning,
Central Standard Time,

259
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,848
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,

260
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,389
killing everyone on board.

261
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,357
And that's the train
that you've been on.

262
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,520
No, no, no. I'm right here.
You're talking to me right now.

263
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,162
A man named Sean Fentress
was on that train.

264
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,794
He, for all intents and purposes,
is now you.

265
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,600
Every second spent explaining things

266
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,642
puts more innocent civilians at risk.

267
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,737
- This makes no sense.
- The train explosion

268
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,839
was the first attack of a series.
There are going to be more.

269
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,409
Now, did you find the bomb?

270
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,788
In the restroom.

271
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,323
Ventilation panel above the sink.

272
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,258
Cell phone detonator.

273
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,155
Are we done?

274
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,661
No, no. But that's good.
That's very, very good, Captain.

275
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,200
Good.

276
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,902
Our records show that 1,812 calls ended
at the moment of the explosion.

277
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:13,433
Fifty-two of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.

278
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,810
So, one of those calls was made
by our bomber.

279
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,578
Do you remember a freight train
passing by just before the explosion?

280
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,312
- Yes.
- The explosion was timed

281
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,786
to engulf the passing freight train,

282
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,630
which means the bomber
had to be watching both trains

283
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:26,849
when the call was made.

284
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,753
Fifty-two callers.

285
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,318
One of those is our bomber.

286
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,088
I want you to concentrate
on the passengers in your car.

287
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:35,164
Get to know them.

288
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,296
Narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem

289
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,931
quiet or withdrawn.

290
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,669
Who seem nervous.

291
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,370
As always,
you will have eight minutes.

292
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,610
Eight minutes
and then I blow up again?

293
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,140
Yes.

294
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,481
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.

295
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,649
Perform only the tasks
that we assign you.

296
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,090
Everything else is irrelevant.

297
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,252
Charge the drivers.

298
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,455
Okay. Has my father even...

299
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,369
I took your advice.

300
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,334
It was very good advice.

301
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,207
Watch it.

302
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,874
You're kind of quiet
today.

303
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,440
Just got a lot on my mind.

304
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:27,507
Careful.

305
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,880
Yikes.

306
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,512
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

307
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,684
Ticket?

308
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,750
That was very kind of you.

309
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,199
You're very decent.

310
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,738
Thank you.

311
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,411
You're real.

312
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,840
Ticket?

313
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,274
- How's everything today?
- It's good.

314
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,818
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- No.

315
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,446
I meant behavior on the train.

316
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,151
Does anything, anybody
seem strange to you?

317
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,852
You're a little strange.

318
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,192
How about you?
Does anybody look suspicious?

319
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,365
Are you drunk or something?

320
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,065
Come here.

321
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,101
Come here for a second.

322
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,132
Come on.

323
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,913
Think of it as a game.

324
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,181
A game?

325
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,114
Wow.

326
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,659
They're all so utterly normal, Sean.

327
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,629
That's what's so terrifying
about them.

328
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,162
Maybe there's a team at work.

329
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,529
The sleeping giant in cahoots
with the minister and Denoff there.

330
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,707
Don't forget the sullen college kid.
He's the expendable one.

331
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,267
I bet they're all controlled
by the conductor.

332
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,211
Standing there all dictatorial.
Demanding tickets.

333
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,650
You're funny.

334
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,313
Damn it.

335
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,583
What about that guy?

336
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,118
Deposition.

337
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,251
What about the woman
who's sitting across from him?

338
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,420
Hair appointment. Every Monday.
You know this.

339
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,986
You talk to these people
more than I do.

340
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,964
Right, right.
And the guy behind her,

341
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,433
he's late for an audition, right?

342
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,596
That or a court appearance.

343
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,833
- That's the guy that was cited twice
for DUI. - For DUI. I know.

344
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,807
- Hey, how's the signal in here?
- It's good.

345
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,737
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

346
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,372
Is teaching not stimulating
enough for you anymore, Sherlock?

347
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,244
Uh-oh.

348
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,585
Now we've slipped
into racial profiling land.

349
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,988
Did anyone else come out
of that bathroom today?

350
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,024
Well, I saw you
coming out of there.

351
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,388
- Me?
- Yes.

352
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,431
- No.
- Glenbrook Station, next stop.

353
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:54,624
Me?

354
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,327
Hey, mister!

355
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,561
- Hey.
- Hold on.

356
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,536
Hold on a second.
Just hold on a second.

357
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,936
There's gotta be something in here.

358
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,600
- You dropped this.
- Gotta be something in here.

359
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,174
A broken phone? What is this?

360
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,879
Glenbrook Station.

361
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,010
Christina?

362
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,713
Yeah.

363
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,548
Excuse me.

364
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,384
Glenbrook Station.

365
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,128
Hey. Hey, come with me.

366
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,028
- This isn't our stop.
- No, come on. Let's take a walk.

367
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,067
- We don't get off here.
- I know. We'll just be spontaneous.

368
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,192
You're kind of freaking me out.

369
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,806
I know this is gonna sound
really weird,

370
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,778
but I have a really bad feeling
about this train,

371
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,247
and I think that we should
get off. Okay?

372
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,548
- Just get your stuff.
- All aboard. Doors are closing.

373
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,725
Come on. Come with me.

374
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,293
So, what now?

375
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,029
Wait for me, right here.
I'll be right back.

376
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,840
Your attention, please.
Train 7140 to Skokie

377
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:16,642
will be leaving in 15 minutes
from track two.

378
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:47,568
Your attention, please. Train 7140
to Skokie will be leaving in...

379
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,385
Hey.

380
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:40,158
You ready to get that coffee now?

381
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,762
Sorry, yeah.
Just one more second, okay?

382
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,644
Oh, for God's sake.

383
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,307
Feeling sick?

384
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,123
It's motion sickness.
I get it all the time.

385
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,428
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me?

386
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,335
- Are you following me?
- Can I borrow your phone?

387
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,230
No. I don't have one.

388
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,001
Sure?

389
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,336
Yeah, I'm sure.

390
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,537
Look, why don't you leave me alone,
please. Or I'll call the police.

391
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,204
With what? I thought you said
you didn't have a phone.

392
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,679
You know, you have no right.

393
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,050
What are you doing
Give me my bag back!

394
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,288
Are you crazy?

395
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,622
- Where are they?
- Sean?

396
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,689
Get back!

397
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,099
Sean, what are you doing?

398
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,965
Sean, what's going on?

399
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,739
- Sean!
- Where is the phone?

400
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,937
Sean! Sean!

401
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,575
It wasn't you.

402
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,748
What the hell's wrong with you?

403
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,949
- No!
- Are you insane?

404
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,254
No! No! No!

405
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,084
- Where is the phone?
- Stop it!

406
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,322
- Get away from me!
- Where is it?

407
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,829
Get away from me, please!

408
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,102
Sean. Sean!
Get up! Sean?

409
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,468
- Shit.
- Sean, listen to me! Get up!

410
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,630
- Sean! Sean! - Give me
your hand! Get off the track!

411
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,209
- Mister, come on!
- Sean, Sean, get up!

412
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,070
Sean! Sean!

413
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,655
Cold.

414
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,261
Goodwin?

415
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,730
Goodwin, come in. Do you read me?

416
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,705
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered
Castle. Do you copy? Please respond.

417
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,845
It's freezing in here.
What's going on?

418
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,818
What was that?

419
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,120
He's in trouble.

420
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,658
I think the oxygen just went out.

421
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,596
Goodwin?

422
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,701
Goodwin!

423
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:47,811
Find a way to get through to him.

424
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,597
What is it?

425
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,404
What's going on?

426
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,048
It's not the tertiary cooling,
either.

427
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,393
Just keep sending strings out.
See if he hooks onto something.

428
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,901
It's hard to say exactly
what he's going through.

429
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,746
- Sir?
- Please!

430
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:55,944
There's not a whole lot
we can do from here.

431
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,926
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have?

432
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,431
Some.

433
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,058
But not a lot.

434
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,191
There are four principal dialects
of Arabic.

435
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:46,601
Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-Lebanese
and North African.

436
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,232
We will now play you portions of each,
discussing their differences.

437
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,491
Lilly awoke in an evening
dress and opera cloak.

438
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,686
In her hand were five playing cards.

439
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,457
They were the queen of spades,
the four of clubs...

440
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:23,796
Goodwin, you out there?

441
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,010
Goodwin? Where's Goodwin?

442
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,844
This is Captain Stevens.
Do you copy?

443
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,215
Captain Stevens?

444
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,753
The capsule lost power.

445
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,015
The capsule?

446
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,651
Is that where you are right now,
Captain? In a capsule?

447
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,390
You should know.
Who are you?

448
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,692
Let me get Captain Goodwin.
Get Goodwin.

449
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,162
You invented this thing, right?

450
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,228
- I did.
- Wait. Are you in command here?

451
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,027
I am. Were you able to locate
the information we need, Captain?

452
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,134
That's a negative, sir.

453
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,295
I was unable
to find the bomber,

454
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,475
but I did save a passenger
on the train.

455
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,036
I got her off safely. A woman.

456
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,455
Captain? It's gonna be
counterproductive for you

457
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,051
to try to save
anyone on that train.

458
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,346
They are outside the mission.

459
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,983
But she survived.

460
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,317
And maybe the rest could, too.

461
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,516
She survived,
but only inside the source code.

462
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,616
None of them can be saved.

463
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,388
What is the source code?

464
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,260
It's quantum mechanics.
Parabolic calculus.

465
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,164
- It's very complicated.
- Try me.

466
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,430
Fine.

467
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,368
When a light bulb is turned off,
there's an after-glow,

468
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,568
a lingering, halo-like effect.
Have you seen it?

469
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,768
- Yes.
- Of course.

470
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,680
The brain is like that.

471
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,717
Its electromagnetic field
remains charged,

472
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,911
just briefly, even after death.
Circuits remain open.

473
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,051
Now, there's another peculiarity
about the brain.

474
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,818
It contains a short-term
memory track

475
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,552
that's approximately
eight minutes long.

476
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,057
Like a convenience store
security camera

477
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,528
that only records
the last portion

478
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,497
of the day's activity
on its hard drive.

479
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,363
Now, in combining these
two phenomena,

480
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,999
circuitry that remains
viable post-mortem

481
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,562
and a memory bank
that goes back eight minutes,

482
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,973
source code enables us to capitalize
on the overlap.

483
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,941
Sean Fentress died on that train.

484
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,241
Of all the passengers aboard,

485
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:13,773
he was your best link.
You two share compatibility

486
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:17,686
in terms of gender, body-size,
and your synaptic maps.

487
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,450
What happens
after the eight minutes?

488
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,885
After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.

489
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,923
You cannot exist inside the source code
beyond Fentress's eight minutes.

490
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,571
Source code is not time travel.

491
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,268
Rather, source code
is time reassignment.

492
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,279
It gives us access
to a parallel reality.

493
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,679
Now, the deaths on that train
were a tragedy,

494
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,148
but source code empowers us...

495
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,414
No, but I saved one person.

496
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,047
That girl that's always sitting
across from me.

497
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,853
I pulled her off the train.

498
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,689
Give me her name.

499
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,420
Christina.
I don't remember her last name.

500
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,297
Her name was Christina Warren.

501
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,504
- Yes.
- She was 28.

502
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,875
- That's her.
- Born in Wilmette, Illinois.

503
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,106
Died this morning on the train.

504
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,911
No, no. I pulled her off.
She's fine.

505
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,009
No, she isn't.

506
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,515
Believe me. She is.

507
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,944
Believe me!

508
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,287
She saw me get hit
by the express train.

509
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,256
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, no, no, wait.

510
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,457
Sir, we have to send him in. A second
attack is imminent, Dr. Rutledge.

511
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,555
What second attack?

512
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,727
The train was just the beginning,
a letter of intent.

513
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,301
What aren't you telling me here?

514
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,166
We have information that
downtown Chicago is the next target,

515
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,438
and they're planning to detonate
a dirty bomb.

516
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,909
Do you have any idea
how many people would die

517
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,506
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?

518
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,977
We're evacuating as we speak.

519
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,645
We have to stop it before it happens.
Do you understand?

520
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,451
If you find the bomber,
his second attack,

521
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,049
the real attack, we think,
can be prevented.

522
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,815
We have very little time left.

523
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,861
Out here, the clocks only move
in one direction.

524
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,231
Charge the drivers.

525
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,200
On the upper deck of the next carriage,
there's a conductor's compartment.

526
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,561
It's a small office
containing a strongbox.

527
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,936
Inside is a loaded handgun.

528
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,204
Get to it. You are authorized
to use whatever force necessary.

529
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,105
I took your advice.

530
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,485
It was very good advice.

531
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,758
You're still here.

532
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,886
Of course I am.

533
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,951
Guess what?

534
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,290
You quit your job
and you enrolled in an LSAT course.

535
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,157
Good guess.

536
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,358
Soda can.

537
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,593
Coffee spill.

538
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,872
Listen to me.

539
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:50,836
Don't answer this.

540
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,403
You deserve better than that guy.

541
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,709
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?

542
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,547
- Ticket?
- How did you know that was...

543
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,411
- Are we going to make up the 10
minutes? - We are going to try, sir.

544
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,113
- How well do you know me?
- Hey, Grandpa...

545
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,449
Not that well, apparently.

546
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,387
Do you know me well enough
that if I did something that looked

547
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,220
a little strange and was maybe
even a little bit dangerous,

548
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,351
but I told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?

549
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,090
No.

550
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,728
Wow. That was honest.

551
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,435
You're beautiful. You're kind.

552
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,601
And you're painfully honest.

553
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,533
Who are you? And what did you do
with Sean Fentress?

554
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,044
It's the new me.

555
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,527
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

556
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,039
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

557
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,713
Ticket?

558
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,399
Glenbrook Station.

559
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,853
All right, I don't wanna hurt you.

560
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,459
No, I'm not gonna sit in my seat,
all right? He's bleeding.

561
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,931
He needs medical attention.

562
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,301
Is it true that you tried to steal
a gun out of the train's security box?

563
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,895
Careful, ma'am.

564
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,574
- Damn it!
- What were you thinking?

565
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,372
- Can I borrow your phone? - No!
You need to go to the hospital, Sean.

566
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,415
- Please, please, let me borrow your
phone. - No! Why do you want my phone?

567
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,988
What would you do
if you only had a minute left to live?

568
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,051
I don't know.

569
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,758
I would call my dad.

570
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,131
I would hear his voice,

571
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,996
and I'd tell him I was sorry.

572
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,308
Tell me everything's gonna be okay.

573
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,947
Everything's gonna be okay.

574
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,360
Oh, yeah,
the gun in the strongbox,

575
00:40:01,362 --> 00:40:03,495
that was a really great idea.
Thanks for that.

576
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,493
Did you make any progress?

577
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,360
Can I get access to a phone?

578
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,506
I need to talk to my father.

579
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:13,570
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes. I will try.

580
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,541
Goodwin, how am I doing?

581
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,380
I'm just trying
to measure my performance here.

582
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,321
Have you ever gone back in?
Am I doing better than you did?

583
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,054
We are wasting valuable time here.

584
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,232
No, no.

585
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:44,433
I have never been on the other side
of a source code mission.

586
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,443
- I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
- Why not?

587
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,069
CAOC-N. What is that?

588
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,547
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.

589
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,716
What are they?

590
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,879
Captain, you should have found
a suspect by now.

591
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:02,056
This tactical advantage, this
tremendous tool that we've given you,

592
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,821
don't squander it thinking. Do.

593
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,094
Please contact my father for me.

594
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:11,235
This will stop
at some point, Captain.

595
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,627
As soon as you finish the mission.

596
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,036
And you're doing really great.

597
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,166
And this will end.

598
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,173
Now, whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.

599
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,548
Some gloves, a screwdriver to get
into the overhead vent,

600
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,608
flashlight, something.

601
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,615
Check bags and backpacks,
briefcases, anything.

602
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,829
So, I took your advice.

603
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:41,187
- It was very good advice.
- Hey, Grandpa...

604
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:00,744
- What are you doing? - I'm just
trying to remember something.

605
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,752
- What is that?
- It's a military patch.

606
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,619
Were you in the military?

607
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,748
A friend of mine was.

608
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,897
He was in Afghanistan
and he disappeared,

609
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:13,491
and no one's
heard from him since.

610
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,302
Do you have the Internet
on your phone?

611
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:20,928
No.

612
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,899
It's just connected to the office
by a really long piece of string.

613
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,606
Do you think you can see
what you could find on this guy?

614
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,910
- Sure. - He's just been
on my mind a lot lately.

615
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,644
His name is Captain Colter Stevens.
He's in the 17th Airborne.

616
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,543
Okay. You owe me.

617
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,252
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

618
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,654
Why don't I get one for you now?

619
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,192
Okay. Christina?

620
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:44,983
Um...

621
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,157
I've been having these dreams
lately.

622
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,067
Really vivid.

623
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,026
And you've been in them.

624
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,130
Really?

625
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,802
What? Oh. No. Not like that.
Not that I wouldn't. I...

626
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,367
It's just...

627
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,166
Um...

628
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,930
I'll call you back in a minute,
all right? Yeah.

629
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,803
- Cramming?
- Uh, yeah.

630
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,469
For what?

631
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:39,008
Psych. And I got a big test this
morning, so I should get back to it.

632
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,210
Can I borrow a pen?

633
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,021
Yeah, sure.

634
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,126
Whoa! Hey, that's not cool, man!

635
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,955
Hey, your bag is a mess.

636
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,898
What are you doing, man?

637
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,980
Never find what I'm looking for.

638
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:59,630
It's just like my bag.
It's just like my bag.

639
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,000
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?

640
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,368
Finish your deal.

641
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,374
Stay out of this, tough guy.
It doesn't end well for you.

642
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,208
This guy.

643
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,338
Don't do that.

644
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,677
Nothing. What am I doing?

645
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,745
Jesus.

646
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,443
Dick.

647
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,579
CAOC-N.

648
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,524
- Can you believe that?
- Asshole.

649
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,598
Excuse me, ma'am?

650
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,138
Hey, how are you doing?
Good morning.

651
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,232
- Do you work at Walter Reed?
- Yeah, I used to.

652
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,576
- I'm in the military.
- You're in the military?

653
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,044
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I was wondering...

654
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,308
Then what was going on
down there?

655
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,648
Oh, you know, uh...

656
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,370
We were just having a little bit
of an argument, actually,

657
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,055
about this patch.

658
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,115
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?

659
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,356
No, ma'am, please. Do any of these
letters, they look familiar to you?

660
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,522
Do you know what the "N"
stands for?

661
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,899
It's Air Force,
and the "N" stands for Nellis.

662
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:07,267
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

663
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,533
Thank you.
Can I borrow your phone?

664
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,532
You know what?
Actually, I can pay you for it.

665
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,705
I don't even need to borrow it.
I can pay you for it. I have $100.

666
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:16,958
- Just for a couple minutes...
- I don't want your money.

667
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:18,681
All right?
Just bring it back.

668
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,944
All right.
Thank you so much.

669
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,228
This is a Chicago-bound train.

670
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:34,090
Next stop, Chicago,

671
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,532
Union Station.

672
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,863
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

673
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,200
Post Operator.

674
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,841
- Rutledge, please.
- Please hold.

675
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,883
Name, please?

676
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,046
You tell him
Captain Colter Stevens is calling.

677
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,023
- Hold the line.
- All aboard.

678
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,422
Doors are closing.

679
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,018
Dr. Rutledge
will be on in a moment.

680
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,964
I have to tell you something.

681
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,729
- I know. I found him.
- Your friend?

682
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:16,034
- I got him. Nellis Air Force Base.
Las Vegas. - No, he's not...

683
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,201
He's dead, Sean.

684
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,002
What?

685
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,544
I'm sorry. Your friend was killed
in action two months ago.

686
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,048
No, you must've gotten the name wrong.

687
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,643
Colter Stevens.
17th Airborne helicopter pilot.

688
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,188
It was on the first site
I tried.

689
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,220
His father's name is Donald, right?

690
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,460
This is from last week.

691
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,295
"Donald Stevens will join host,
Leonard Watt, to discuss

692
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,598
the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens,

693
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,831
who died in Afghanistan in February,

694
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:51,898
and was honored posthumously
with a silver star.

695
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:55,835
Also on the broadcast
will be Army Sergeant Robert Alvarez,

696
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,778
whose life was saved
by Captain Stevens

697
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,578
in a fire fight just outside
of Kandahar."

698
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,743
I'm sorry.

699
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,314
Captain?

700
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,393
Sean? Talk to me.

701
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,363
Captain?

702
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,334
Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.

703
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:21,337
You're with Operation Beleaguered
Castle. You're safe.

704
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:25,731
Hey, this guy's crashing!

705
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:32,273
Captain, just tell me what you see.
Just look and speak.

706
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,112
I see a card.

707
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,378
That's good.

708
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,250
Do you copy? We are taking
a lot of RPG fire here.

709
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,416
That's very good.

710
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:53,961
Am I dead?

711
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,005
A radio listing is saying that I died
in a helicopter crash, in country,

712
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,207
and my father received
a medal for me.

713
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,874
Your condition's not the issue here.

714
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,649
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attack.

715
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,278
Everything else is irrelevant.

716
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,515
A news report saying that I'm dead
is irrelevant?

717
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,285
Until the person or persons who blew up
that train are in custody, yes.

718
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,293
Goodwin,

719
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,129
one soldier to another,
am I dead?

720
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,950
Part of your brain remains activated.

721
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,312
What about the rest of me?
I can see my hands and my feet.

722
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,515
They still move.

723
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,747
They are a manifestation.

724
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:51,192
They're just your way of making
sense of all this.

725
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:56,021
So, what are you saying?
Are you saying that I'm imagining this?

726
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,363
I'm imagining that I'm still alive,
that I'm in this capsule?

727
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,510
We have core temp dropping.

728
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:39,766
Captain, what just happened?

729
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,675
I asked you a question.

730
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:53,254
The capsule is a manifestation
as well.

731
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,382
Where am I?

732
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:57,215
That's classified.

733
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,621
Fuck you!

734
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,436
Captain, I cannot imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

735
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,360
But if we're to prevent
a second attack,

736
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,600
we need to send you back
immediately.

737
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,111
And, Captain,
you cannot deviate from the mission

738
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,407
while inside the source code,

739
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,845
even to investigate your...

740
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:21,250
Even to investigate
what happened to you.

741
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:25,045
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can't be unsettled.

742
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,984
Well, you know what? I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.

743
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,993
Just before the explosion,
so at 7:46 this morning,

744
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:34,885
- they paged you with a call from me.
- You may have made

745
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,625
that call from the train,

746
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,500
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.

747
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:42,038
If the call even went through,

748
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,199
it would be received
by a different me entirely.

749
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,080
This may be difficult for you
to hear,

750
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,408
but you are a hand on a clock,
understand?

751
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,575
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.

752
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,143
And that represents the entirety
of your function here.

753
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,883
You know what?
Next time I'll send you a pizza!

754
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,647
I'll see if that makes
an impression!

755
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:06,355
You cannot alter the continuum of this
reality from within the source code.

756
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:08,226
This can't be legal,
what you're doing.

757
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,825
In fact, your acquisition by this
program as well as the program itself

758
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,564
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by military court.

759
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:21,437
Many soldiers would find this
preferable to death.

760
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,969
The opportunity to continue
serving their country.

761
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,378
Have you spent much time
in battle, sir? Huh?

762
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,516
That's immaterial.

763
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,850
Any soldier I've ever served with would
say that one death is service enough.

764
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:41,228
Fine. You can have that in return
for completing this mission.

765
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,529
- Have what?
- I'll give you what you want.

766
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,563
Terminate your service.
Let you die.

767
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,930
This is taking too long.

768
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,470
You've been too easy on him.
No more rest periods.

769
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,276
I am certain we can find
other servicemen

770
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,580
with wounds similar to yours
who would consider

771
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,917
being a part of this program
an honor.

772
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,080
What? No, wait, what?

773
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,282
Send him back.

774
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,387
Charge the drivers.

775
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,431
And Captain Stevens,
I'd like you to remember

776
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,371
that it's not only about you,
but it's also about

777
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,069
two million real-world Americans.
Now, you may not value your own life,

778
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,039
I do, however,
ask that you value theirs.

779
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,170
Your advice.

780
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,005
Hey, Grandpa.

781
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,127
Calm yourself. You're back.
Did you find the bomber?

782
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:52,368
There are hundreds of people
on that train.

783
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,296
Well, then check them out
one by one.

784
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,801
It doesn't matter what you do
to them. They're already dead.

785
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,036
Get to that gun,
and shoot someone if you have to.

786
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,874
But get us some usable intel.

787
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,671
No! No, wait!

788
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,059
We have to keep doing this
until you find the bomber.

789
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,257
Please. I'm trying. I'm trying.

790
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,623
Who is the bomber?

791
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:26,993
I'm trying.

792
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:33,872
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're
exhausted, and we're all frustrated,

793
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,310
but we cannot fail.
You can do this.

794
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,880
I can't. I can't.

795
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,483
Yes, you can.

796
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,678
You're a born hero, son.

797
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,676
Even your father thinks so.

798
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,685
Saving people is what you do best.

799
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,521
It was about his third tour.

800
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,459
- I didn't want him to go back.
- Dad?

801
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,193
I just started feeling like
he didn't want to come home anymore.

802
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,531
- Dad? - Like somehow,
he couldn't come home.

803
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,202
And he wouldn't talk to me,
wouldn't hear me.

804
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,677
Finally he said he just couldn't leave
his unit out there without him,

805
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,075
and that was that.

806
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,040
Those guys were his family.

807
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,818
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I don't know,

808
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,649
I never fully understood him.

809
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,988
And I can't believe he's gone.

810
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,791
Send me back in.

811
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,730
Please don't blow me up again.

812
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,166
Hello?

813
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:38,826
I know it's you.

814
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:42,029
Now approaching
Glenbrook Station.

815
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,437
I'm gonna find you.
Turn around.

816
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:49,602
- Hey, there.
- Me?

817
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,745
Why do you look so surprised?

818
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,646
Don't.

819
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,655
Move. I said move. Move.
Put your bag over there.

820
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:03,750
- Okay.
- Move over.

821
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,294
- Put the bag over there
and move over. - Okay, okay.

822
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,525
Move over. Move over.
Now hand me your phone.

823
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,734
- You're done. You're done.
- What?

824
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,332
You can't kill anybody anymore.

825
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,901
What? I don't understand.

826
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,529
You were going to trigger the bomb
with your phone.

827
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:20,975
What? Dude, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

828
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:26,171
Listen, my name's George Troxel.
I'm a software engineer, okay?

829
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,944
- Right.
- I was talking to my wife.

830
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,086
Try it again.

831
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,982
Your call. Dial it again.

832
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,657
Okay. I'm gonna press redial.

833
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:41,196
Your phone is gonna ring,
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

834
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,766
Shit. I'm sorry. Sorry.

835
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:52,932
Hey!

836
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,004
You dropped this.

837
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,102
Wow. Thanks.

838
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,146
Hey!

839
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:30,878
All aboard. Doors are closing.

840
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,646
Shit! No! No!

841
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,645
No!

842
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,686
Wait!

843
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:45,354
No! Come on!

844
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,037
Stop the train!

845
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:26,494
Hey!

846
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,166
Hey!

847
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,512
- Derek Frost.
- Yes?

848
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,947
- See this?
- Yes.

849
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,182
- You recognize it?
- No.

850
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,457
Jesus.

851
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,458
How about you give me
your wallet?

852
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,326
Okay.

853
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,136
You left it on the train
deliberately.

854
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:05,975
I must have dropped it.

855
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:07,503
No.

856
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:10,911
You planted it there,
so everybody would think you were dead.

857
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,013
I know it's you.

858
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,182
How do you know so much?

859
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,091
What the hell is that thing?

860
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,632
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down! Slow down!

861
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,502
Do you wanna see it?

862
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,401
Very patriotic.

863
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,837
Slowly, slowly!

864
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:49,478
All right, all right!
Back up! Back up! Back up!

865
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,619
Not many people could build that.

866
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,137
All right.
Where is your next target?

867
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:11,462
Sean?

868
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,477
Oh, my God!

869
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:49,403
Sean Fentress?

870
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,575
Teacher.

871
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,744
History.

872
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,948
I don't know you.

873
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,250
I think I killed your girlfriend.

874
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:04,920
Why?

875
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,587
You messed up my timing.

876
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,127
- Why?
- Oh.

877
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,897
You mean "Why this"?

878
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:19,535
Because the world is hell.

879
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,477
But we have a chance to start over
in the rubble.

880
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,010
But first there has to be rubble.

881
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,878
You're a teacher,
you understand.

882
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,447
Christina.

883
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,184
Stay with me. Stay with me.

884
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,754
Everything's gonna be okay.

885
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,102
This isn't the end.

886
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,937
Check through there.
I'll go check this way.

887
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,249
- Okay.
- This is Beleaguered Castle.

888
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:24,697
Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.

889
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:36,302
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered
Castle. Acknowledge transmission.

890
01:03:36,379 --> 01:03:38,745
I have your bomber.
I have his name.

891
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,748
You have the bomber's name?

892
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:46,911
Derek Frost.

893
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:56,228
He got into a rented white van
in the Glenbrook Station parking lot.

894
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:00,565
Illinois plates, five, Charlie,
Golf, Yankee, eight, four, seven.

895
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,804
Illinois plates, 5CGY847.

896
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,040
All right, let's move.

897
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,968
And Goodwin, there is
a radioactive device in the van.

898
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,707
Some kind of bomb.

899
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,837
Thank you, Captain.

900
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,007
Yes, ma'am.

901
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,684
Thank you, Captain.
You are now off the clock.

902
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,982
About our deal?

903
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:24,459
I had hoped that you might reconsider
that, for the sake of the program.

904
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,891
I have.
I want something else now.

905
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:28,824
Good.

906
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,464
I still wanna die.

907
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,462
But I want to go back in

908
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,630
and I wanna save all those people
on that train first.

909
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,970
It doesn't work that way.
It can't.

910
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,634
No, I know.
I know, I know.

911
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:45,239
I'm not really asking you
to believe me, sir. I'm just...

912
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,511
I'm asking you
to have the decency to let me try.

913
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,751
CPD-2, this is AU SWAT-1.

914
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,253
Van is approaching fence gate
to the quarry. Over.

915
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,523
Roger that, AU SWAT-1. Allow
the vehicle to enter the quarry road.

916
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:03,326
We'll stop him
about halfway down. Over.

917
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,531
AU SWAT-2, this is CPD-2.
Block the east end of the road. Over.

918
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,401
AU SWAT-2, roger that.

919
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:14,302
We're going to switch now to a
live feed from our Chicago affiliate.

920
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:17,073
The SWAT team
is approaching the white van.

921
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,512
The Illinois man has been sought
since early this morning.

922
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,413
The door is open
and the man is on the ground.

923
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,884
It appears he has surrendered.

924
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,219
Earlier today,
the police discovered...

925
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,622
Congratulations, Captain.

926
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,690
In recent months,
Frost started posting

927
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:33,789
anti-government statements
on his website.

928
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,997
Yes, sir, it's a real validation
of the program.

929
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,763
A clear window into just how
revolutionary source code can be.

930
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:44,364
We finally have a powerful weapon
now in the war on terror.

931
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,804
Congratulations, Captain.
A job well done.

932
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,207
He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?

933
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,641
I'm still waiting on an answer.

934
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,551
Are you married, Captain?

935
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,150
Um...

936
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,654
Joe?

937
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,393
Why don't you go take a break?

938
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,057
- You deserve to celebrate.
- Sure.

939
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,293
Can I get you something?

940
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,126
No, I'm fine.

941
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,901
Why? Are you asking me
on a date?

942
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,465
Sorry. Poor taste.

943
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,738
- Are you married?
- Hmm?

944
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:24,637
No.

945
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,971
I am divorced.

946
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,682
Do you think there's an
alternate version of you?

947
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,050
A Goodwin who made
different choices?

948
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,885
What do you mean?

949
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,894
Like, a you who didn't get married
and get divorced.

950
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:43,193
Or just married someone else.

951
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,494
A woman who took
a different fork in the road.

952
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,604
No, I don't, Captain.

953
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,433
What you experienced
was a shadow.

954
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:58,804
It was an afterimage
of a victim on a train.

955
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,240
This is real life. Here.

956
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,650
The one where you're talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?

957
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:13,726
The program wasn't designed
to alter the past.

958
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:17,388
It was designed to affect the future.
And you've done that.

959
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,661
I missed something, Captain.

960
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:21,998
That train shouldn't have blown up.

961
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:23,561
There must have been
a second detonator,

962
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,163
something I couldn't see.
A fail-safe.

963
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,677
It's a computer program, Captain.

964
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:33,874
The girl on the train,
all the others, they're lost.

965
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,417
I'm sorry about that.

966
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:37,816
I get it. I get it.

967
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,279
I know.
Quantum physics, parabolic calculus.

968
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:43,858
You're wrong, Goodwin.

969
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,825
You're just plain wrong.

970
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,753
Captain, Christina is dead.

971
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,563
She doesn't have to be, ma'am.

972
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,196
Okay. I'll ask Rutledge.

973
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,130
I'm asking you,

974
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:00,473
I'm asking you. Just...

975
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,101
Send me...

976
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,331
Captain.

977
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,599
It's your choice.

978
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:09,971
At the end of this source code,
I will terminate your life support.

979
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,282
There will be no coming back.

980
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,316
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin.

981
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,620
It was an honor, Captain.

982
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,234
And I thank you
for your service.

983
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,102
Good luck.

984
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,281
I took your advice.

985
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,623
You're gonna move to India,
and become a guru.

986
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,489
Careful, ma'am.

987
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,656
Yeah, I'm gonna go
find myself in the mountains.

988
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,600
Well, maybe you'll have a cup of coffee
with me before you go.

989
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,406
Yeah. I'd like to do that.
Put it to the test.

990
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,234
Good.

991
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,603
Let's do it today.

992
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:19,739
Let's just skip work. Bryan can find
someone else to assist him.

993
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:25,951
- You know what?
- What?

994
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,552
I feel really good.

995
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,450
Why?

996
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,653
Because I've been waiting for weeks
for you to ask me for coffee.

997
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,065
Ticket?

998
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,234
Okay.

999
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,940
Just give me a couple minutes,
okay? And I'll be right back.

1000
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,037
Gotta go save the world.

1001
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,152
I knew he was a keeper.

1002
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,513
Excuse me!

1003
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:35,689
Beautiful day.

1004
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,921
Now approaching Glenbrook Station.

1005
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:40,855
Ticket?

1006
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,363
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1007
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,831
Glenbrook Station, next stop.

1008
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:49,595
- You trust the DOD?
- They've got the finances.

1009
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,037
Yeah, well, sure.

1010
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:54,372
Look, if we can get the funding,
I guarantee we can have at least...

1011
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:59,775
Eight source code projects up
and running by the end of the year.

1012
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,374
- Really? That many?
- Maybe more.

1013
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:03,918
You're a real hero, Dr. Rutledge.

1014
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:05,751
Well, thank you.

1015
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,489
We did save lives today.

1016
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,525
Yes, a true victory
for the program.

1017
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:12,117
A great victory for us all.

1018
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,821
We'll talk soon.

1019
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,494
So? Exciting times.

1020
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,667
Let's initialize the memory wipe
on SC-1,

1021
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,469
start crunching the data.

1022
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,435
Sir,

1023
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,543
we told Captain Stevens

1024
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,079
that we were gonna let him die.

1025
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,638
Let him die?

1026
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,415
He just saved
millions of lives today.

1027
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,715
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?

1028
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,880
For all we know, he may be

1029
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,119
the only candidate
with which the system works.

1030
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,288
So,

1031
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,730
let's clear his memory

1032
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,921
and reinitialize source code.

1033
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,865
Shall we?

1034
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,271
Yes, sir.

1035
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:06,146
Sorry, I just dropped...

1036
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,877
Hey, Derek!
This isn't your stop.

1037
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,441
Hey, mister!

1038
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,681
You dropped this.

1039
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,657
Come on back here.

1040
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:19,116
Oops.

1041
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,019
Derek,

1042
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:53,923
it's over.

1043
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,331
You understand?

1044
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,970
Hey. My name is Derek Frost.

1045
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,234
I planted a nuclear device
in a white van

1046
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:09,736
parked in the Glenbrook Station CCR
parking lot.

1047
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,507
Right now I'm handcuffed
to a pole

1048
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,209
on the 944 CCR train
headed to Chicago Union Station.

1049
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:18,547
I am a sick and pathetic
human being.

1050
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:22,287
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.

1051
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,053
Okay.

1052
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,297
Derek,

1053
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:33,296
there's no more
burying the world in rubble today.

1054
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,531
You mind if I borrow this?

1055
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:45,478
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.

1056
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:46,603
And...

1057
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:51,016
Do you want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain?

1058
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,075
Hello, Captain.

1059
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,596
- Hello?
- Donald Stevens?

1060
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:36,688
Yes?

1061
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:44,234
My name is Sean Fentress.

1062
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,502
Who?

1063
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,135
I served with your son, Colter.

1064
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,477
- Oh, boy.
- It's...

1065
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,246
I'm sorry it's taken me
so long to call you.

1066
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,655
Sometimes it just takes a while
to figure out

1067
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,855
what you want to say.
You know?

1068
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,765
Don't be too hard on yourself.

1069
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:11,462
I imagine it's not an easy call
to make.

1070
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,873
How are you doing, sir?

1071
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,811
Well, all that came back
was some ash.

1072
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,643
It's hard to believe
that it was him.

1073
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:39,986
How well did you know him?

1074
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,164
I was there when he died, sir.

1075
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,266
He said

1076
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:56,542
that the last time
that you guys talked was tough,

1077
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,539
and

1078
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,545
he wanted to say
that he was sorry.

1079
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,248
I just want him back.

1080
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,816
I loved him so much.

1081
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,851
I wish you could have
told him that.

1082
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:52,099
He knows it.

1083
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,564
You take care, Mr. Stevens.

1084
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,158
You okay?

1085
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:30,160
Yeah.

1086
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:32,798
Save the world?

1087
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:34,764
Sort of.

1088
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,742
So, where were we?

1089
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,411
Getting some coffee.

1090
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:44,908
Dr. Rutledge.

1091
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,144
What?

1092
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,527
Shit.

1093
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,999
What's so damn hard about it?
I run a business, okay?

1094
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,595
Everything moves on time
or people get fired.

1095
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,106
That's the way it works
in the real world.

1096
01:19:06,574 --> 01:19:08,506
- Ten minutes.
- Hey, buddy?

1097
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:11,636
Don't sweat the small stuff.
You'll drown.

1098
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,815
Thank you for that moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.

1099
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,925
What, are you selling
self-help CDs today?

1100
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,718
Why don't you just mind
your own business.

1101
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:23,290
Security? Get me a detachment
of MPs here this instant!

1102
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,653
Why are you always
so bitter, Max?

1103
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:30,689
It's a bitter world we live in,
my friend. What do you want from me?

1104
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,534
It doesn't have to be.

1105
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:39,971
I will bet you $100 you can't make
all these people on this train laugh.

1106
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,942
Oh. Right.

1107
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:49,777
Actually, you know what?
126 bucks.

1108
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:52,510
Is that your way
of making fun of me?

1109
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:54,112
I guess you have a better gig.
Never mind.

1110
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,781
No, no. I'm good.

1111
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,525
Easiest money ever.

1112
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,118
- Come on.
- Excuse me, people.

1113
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,530
One of our fellow passengers

1114
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,829
has decided to offer me
some money to...

1115
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:09,428
What has gotten into you today?
You're like a different person.

1116
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,802
- It's the new me.
- I like it.

1117
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:16,836
I am going to prosecute you
to the full extent of the law.

1118
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,070
Women always mess up my last name.

1119
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,776
I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me "Getoff".

1120
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,115
She was like, "Getoff! Getoff!"
I'm like, "No, Denoff, Denoff".

1121
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,553
She says, "No, you're fat
and you're heavy. Get off!"

1122
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,324
Good?

1123
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,951
Twenty seconds.

1124
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,495
Make it ten.

1125
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,554
Goodwin?

1126
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:41,922
Look at all this.

1127
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,869
It's good to see you, ladies,
up this early in the morning.

1128
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,635
- What?
- Michelle. Barack.

1129
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,605
All this life.

1130
01:20:56,885 --> 01:21:00,321
Goodwin. Open this door.

1131
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,763
Put those headphones on.
I wanna see them stretch.

1132
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,325
- Why do you keep looking
at your watch? - Christina,

1133
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:17,767
what would you do

1134
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,039
if you knew you had
less than a minute to live?

1135
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,846
I'd make those seconds count.

1136
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,985
I'd kiss you again.

1137
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,122
Again? Mmm.

1138
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,690
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!

1139
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,652
He's done enough, Doctor.

1140
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,051
And, I'm on the train...

1141
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,844
Everything's gonna be okay.

1142
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,727
It is a beautiful Monday
in Chicago today.

1143
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,958
Temperatures expected to
reach the lower 60s.

1144
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:27,399
Right now 55 at the lakefront,
54 at Midway,

1145
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:28,663
53 at O'Hare.

1146
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,364
And now, up in the sky,
we've got...

1147
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:34,465
He earned that money.

1148
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:35,703
- Yeah, he did.
- He was funny.

1149
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:38,974
- Speaking of which,
I have no cash. - Great.

1150
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:42,346
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

1151
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,677
- Such a beautiful day,
isn't it? - Yeah.

1152
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,846
It is a really perfect day.

1153
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:00,928
Do you believe in fate?

1154
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:04,762
Not really. I'm more of
a dumb luck kind of gal.

1155
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:07,503
- Come here.
- Wow.

1156
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:26,556
So what do you wanna do today?

1157
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:30,727
I think we should stay
here for a while.

1158
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:35,693
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?

1159
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,670
Las Vegas' number one
morning news follows.

1160
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,475
It's 72 degrees
on a cloudy Monday morning.

1161
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:50,814
This is News Radio 840KX
in North Las Vegas.

1162
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:53,218
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Captain.

1163
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:59,155
Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak.

1164
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:03,021
In her hand were five playing cards.

1165
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:08,326
At some point today,
you're gonna hear about

1166
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:12,203
a failed terrorist attack
on a commuter train near Chicago.

1167
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,076
You and I kept that bomb
from going off.

1168
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:19,570
An attempted bombing on a CCR train
outside Chicago.

1169
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:23,682
But it was thwarted,
and the suspect was found on board,

1170
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:27,253
- named Derek Frost.
- Derek Frost.

1171
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,562
Captain Goodwin,
anything I can help you with?

1172
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:41,235
No, that's fine.
I'll come back later.

1173
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:47,634
Keep an eye out.

1174
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:52,410
One of these days
the right crisis

1175
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,573
is going to rear its head

1176
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:59,013
and source code is going to
have its moment in the sun.

1177
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,685
Yes, sir.

1178
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:10,029
If you're reading this e-mail,

1179
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:14,330
then source code works even better
than you and Dr. Rutledge imagined.

1180
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:17,303
You thought you were creating
eight minutes of a past event,

1181
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:18,839
but you're not.

1182
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,899
You've created
a whole new world.

1183
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:27,040
Goodwin, if I'm right,
somewhere at the source code facility

1184
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,881
you have a Captain Colter Stevens
waiting to send on a mission.

1185
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:34,979
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.

1186
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,188
Tell him
everything is gonna be okay.
