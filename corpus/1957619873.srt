is the result of years
of scientific research.

59
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,859
My father,
Dr. Fredrick Conlon,

60
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,961
won the Nobel prize
for pioneering

biological revolution

62
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,365
back in the 1950s.

63
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,667
Soon afterwards, he founded
the Conlon Institute,

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,637

remains at the cutting edge

Linda came to us

She's been caring
for them since their
natural mother abandoned them

and she oversees
their training,
their education

73

00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,618
(THUDDING)

181
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,756
Stay!

182
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,863
Linda is bringing Swan
up to speed on her
research with the chimps

183
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,565
and how we plan
to implant...

184
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,768
DINA: And the butterfly

185
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,770
stood on the mountain.

186
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,639
And

187
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,708
the butterfly had wings.

188
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,677
Big wings.

189
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,679
With colors.

190
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,150
And they saw her fly.

191
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,520
Fly high in the sky and...

192
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,923
Hi.

193
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:11,992
Hello.

194
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,162
I know you.

195
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,099
-GIRL: Come on, Dina.
What's next?
-BOY: Yeah!

196
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,269
GIRL: Come on!

197
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:24,938
And...

198
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:31,712
And...

199
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:32,880
It's upside down.

200
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,249
I can't read good.

201
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,752
The butterfly...

202
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,022
-The butterfly landed on...
-(CHUCKLES)

203
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,056
...a big leaf.

204
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,026
And he...

205
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,229
GIRL: Come on, Dina.

206
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,765
-BOY: What happened?
-DINA: ...landed next

207
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,134
to a caterpillar...

208
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,806
LINDA: Self recognition
measures a special
kind of intelligence,

209
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,708
the sense of self.

210
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,176
Most animals just see
another animal
when the look in the mirror.

211
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,213
Laverne and Shirley
know they're looking
at themselves.

212
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,617
Not only are the chimps
healthy as horses,
so to speak,

213
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,085
but since taking
injections, they're smart
as whips.

214
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,022
Leonard. Leonard, come here.

215
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,924
This is Leonard Takawa.

216
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:17,958
He's our senior
lab technician.

217
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,993
Graduated MIT
cum laude at 18.

218
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,829
Leonard, this is Dr. Swan.

219
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,030
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

220
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,965
LINDA: Would you boot up
the computer game
please, Leonard?

221
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,668
We're gonna get him
to talk one of these days.

222
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,936
(LAUGHS)

223
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,303
Who wants to show off
for Dr. Swan?

224
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,138
(SHRIEKING)

225
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:36,944
LINDA: Not yet, you!

226
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,311
(BOTH LAUGHING)

227
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,849
-Make yourself
at home, all right?
-Thank you.

228
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,084
Just don't go near
Mitch's desk.
It could go at any second.

229
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,155
Computer games geared
for a third or fourth grader.

230
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,356
Laverne has it down.

231
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,825
First thing we noticed
was a rapid acceleration
of their IQ.

232
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,293
Linda's monitoring, of course.

233
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,995
Physiologically,
they're stable.

234
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,329
Blood test
consistent and normal.

235
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,232
What's interesting
is the degree to which
they crave stimuli.

236
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,834
I mean, the more the better.

237
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,136
New puzzles, games,
color, movement.

238
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,672
They make a fuss
when we leave at night.

239
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,307
Hmm, interesting.
Any other side effects?

240
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,876
-Yes.
-What?

241
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,010
Hairy palms.

242
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,344
Ah! (LAUGHING)

243
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,864
Hi.

244

245
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,138
Hi, dummy.

246
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,240
-(CHUCKLES)
-Can't you say hi?

247
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,374
Hi.

248
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,710
Oh.

249
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,077
Your shoe.

250
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,879
(CHUCKLES)

251
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,180
You got paint on your shoe.

252
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,216
It's pretty.

253
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,918
Yeah, it's pretty messy, huh?

254
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,419
-Yes.
-(LAUGHING)

255
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,188
Why don't you try
to get some paint
on the picture, uh?

256
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,858
I do. I get paint
on the picture.

257
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,859
-Look, I got it.
-(LAUGHS)

258
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,761
(SCREAMS) Hey!

259
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,895
Hey!

260
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,732
Come on!

261
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,900
Rip it up!

262
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,368
(SCREAMS) Hey!

263
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,204
Come on!

264
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,973
Give it to me!

265
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,374
Want a ride? Hop on!

(BOYS LAUGHING)

272
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,826
I saw her again today.

273
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,832
She was with that
group of kids

274
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,901
who really seemed to love her.

275
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:46,139
I was observing her
motor skills and, uh...

276
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,208
This logical progression
of thought

277
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,244
she uses to tell stories...

278
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,782
We've seen abstract reasoning
through her ability to express
herself with her paintings.

279
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,883
Mmm.

280
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,752
I gotta tell you
something. I...

281
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,788
I have to admit
I can't stop
thinking about her.

282
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,991
LINDA: Let's bring 
 Swan to the park tomorrow.

283
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,258
See what he thinks.

284
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,960
MITCH: Okay.

285
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,061
Let's have Swan meet her.

286
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,430
-Hi.
-MITCH: Hi.

287
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,199
-How are you?
-I'm busy.

288
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,302
Can I have some
coffee, please?

289
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,204
Yes.

290
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,106
And one of these cookies.
How much?

291
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,875
Andy can do change.

292
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,343
I can't do change.

293
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,744
Uh, that comes to $2.35.

294
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,015
Let me introduce myself.

295
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,349
My name is Dr. Mitch Conlon.

296
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:32,119
Doctors make me
take my clothes off.

297
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,187
I'm Andy Chase.
This is Dina.

298
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,059
Would you happen to know
how we can get in
touch with Dina's family?

299
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,795
I'm it. She's my aunt.

300
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:42,796
And my right-hand gal.

301
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,032
I'm a right-hand gal.

302
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,900
She came to work for me
when I bought the place.

303
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,136
I can't read good.

304
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,270
Perhaps we can help.

305
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,005
This is Dr. Linda Ryan.

306
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,206
We're with
the Conlon Institute.

307
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,142
We're involved
with genetic research.

308
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,211
Oh, so you're the guys
in that big institute
up the street.

309
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,512
I've read about you.

310
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,514
-This is Dr. Swan.
-Hello.

311
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:02,883
MITCH: He's a teacher.

312
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,217
Can you make me read good?

313
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,819
Well, maybe we can.

314
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,155
Can you make me read
signs in the grass?

315
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,189
ANDY: Dina, please.

316
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,259
Mr. Chase, we have
every reason to believe

317
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,928
that we can enhance
Dina's mental capacity
to some degree.

318
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,296
How?

319
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,099
With your permission,
we'd like Dina to come
to the institute.

320
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,134
We'll give her
a complete physical
and a battery of tests

321
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,236
to see if she qualifies
for our program.

322
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,437
If she does?

323
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,973
She'll stay with us.

324
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,141
We'll administer
injections daily.

325
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,143
Keep an eye out
for secondary responses.

326
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,879
-What do you mean?
-Side effects.

327
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,246
That sort of thing.

328
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,514
Nothing that would
surprise us.

329
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,951
I like her fine
just the way she is.

330
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,186
I'm sorry.
We're not interested.

331
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,589
Mr. Chase,

332
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,292
Dina would receive
long-term medical care
for her participation.

333
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,394
And we'd put her in school.
Dr. Swan...

334
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,329
-I want to go to school.
-ANDY: Dina.

335
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,597
-I want to, Andy.
-Dina, Dina, please.

336
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,899
I want to go to school!

337
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,266
No!

338
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,968
-Like my friends.
-Dina, be quiet!

339
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,118
The worst that could happen,
Andy, is nothing happens.

340
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,419
She might not even qualify.

341
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,122
MITCH: You've got
nothing to lose.

342
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,461
Dina suffers 
 from microcephaly.

343
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:24,497
Since she's had 
 no formal education, uh,

344
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:28,101
her IQ's a little difficult 
 to pinpoint at this time.

345
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,203
We have to completed 
 some standardized tests.

346
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,373
Measure her against
grade school children,

347
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,943
but I'd place it somewhere
between 50 and 60.

348
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,281
Certain parts of her
cerebral cortex never
fully developed, so

349
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,584
she has a problem
completing higher
order activities,

350
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,086
cognitive functions...

351
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,654
Real people talk, please.

352
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,459
Scholastically,
she's not in
the first grade yet.

353
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,560
(BUZZER BEEPS)

354
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,628
ANDY: What's that?

355
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,497
That's the way
we measure advances.

356
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,466
The game targets

MITCH: Books by great authors 
 are the best teachers 
 in the world.

596
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,192
They can instruct you 
 on anything you need to know 
 in life.

The way to make reading 
 meaningful

598
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:25,431
is to find stories and books 
 that interest you

599
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,599
and reflect the way you're
thinking and feeling.

600

That way, they come alive
and it sticks in your mind.

601
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:35,341
They create mental pictures
that you can hold on to.

602
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:39,345
Books about history can
make you a part
of what's gone on before

and, oh... Poetry.

604
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,184
Poetry speaks to your soul.

605
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,087
Connects you to another being.

she was far from the person

Her mental capacity 
 was that of a kindergartner.

We put Dina 
 on the same formula schedule 
 as our chimps

1241

and then we instituted 
 the same learning regimen

to see if she could achieve 
 the same level 
 of cognitive function.

1371
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:50,719
You were.

1372

Where are you going?

1377
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:15,444
I am a scientist.

1378
01:25:15,478 --> 01:25:17,280
When one experiment ends,
I look for another.

1379
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,350
My father used to say to me,

1380
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,219
"The end is all,

1381
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:26,455
"no matter the cost."

1382
01:25:26,489 --> 01:25:28,391
And this institute
was built on
that very precept.

1383
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:30,393
I never questioned it.

1384
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:32,328
Not until recently.

1385
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:35,898
My father was wrong.

1386
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,568
Science is a two-sided coin.

1387
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:41,704
It can be good

1388
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:43,606
or bad.

1389
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:49,812
The progress that
man has made
in research

1390
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,914
has unleashed
an awesome power.

1391
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:58,287
It has given him
the insight into the miracle
of creation itself.

1392
01:26:00,223 --> 01:26:03,459
The scientist must recognize
the responsibility in that.

1393
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:10,199
He holds human life
in palm of his hand.

1394
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,470
The scientist has been given
the power to play God.

1395
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,310
If he chooses to play God,

1396
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:24,813
then he must
have his conscience.

1397
01:27:05,754 --> 01:27:06,755
DINA: Goodbye.

1398
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:13,629

across the street,
looking back at the Institute

1400
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,335
And I realized
what I had gained.

1401
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:22,405
