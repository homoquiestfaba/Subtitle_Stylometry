1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
A son of a biscuit.

2
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,500
Look at this mess, eew. Bird shit.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,700
Hello sir. Been a long time.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,700
Just take me to the site.

5
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes sir. It's right this way sir.

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,400
Here they are, sir.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
It was a lot of work to get them
side by side like this.

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,700
People objected.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I guess it's understandable I suppose.

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
Where is the boy?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,600
He... Sir, he's not in the grave.

12
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,300
You'd be smart to keep that to yourself.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Oh, no sir. I wouldn't tell anybody.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
No sir, nobody.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Thank you.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,100
Thank you mr Voorhees.

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,600
Thank you sir.

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
You guys are missing out on some pretty good shit.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey, you hear me?

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,995
Yeah, and you know who bought that, right Ace?

21
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,010
Isn't there anything else
you could be doing right now?

22
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,400
Yeah, I would. If you guys brought me a girl.

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,200
-We did.
-She stoned.

24
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,500
Who's fault is that?

25
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,858
Guess I'll just have to check out
some big ol' fat titties of my own.

26
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,500
What the...?

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,700
-Wait. What was that?
-What?

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,500
-Did you hear that?
-Hear what?

29
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know. It's like a chain or something.

30
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,200
Come on, it's probably just Ace.
He's just fucking around.

31
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,201
Yeah.

32
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
What Ace... What the fuck?

33
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,000
You found me again. Dang.

34
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Come on, let's go.

35
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,300
Ashley Jarvis, hide-and-seek champion,

36
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,900
...12 years running.

37
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,000
Tell us, how do you do it?

38
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,300
Can I just have my phone back now?

39
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,000
Sure. Okay. But how about we go
pick up some cookie dough ice cream?

40
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,500
-Who's with me?
-Fine.

41
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Alright, come here.

42
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
What's on... Is going on, man?
What's on your mind?

43
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Nothing.

44
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, really, okay. Because it
doesn't look like nothing.

45
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,900
I just wish I could stay at mom's this summer,

46
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,400
...so I could hang out with my friends.

47
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,500
I know, but I mean, this is the only time
we ever really get to see dad these days,

48
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,400
...so, don't you miss him?

49
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Yeah, but...

50
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
...why can't he come visit us at mom's?

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
You know mom would never go for that, Ash.

52
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
It's... complicated.

53
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,100
Hey! Okay.

54
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,400
Why don't we drive over...

55
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,200
...and visit great-grandma tomorrow?
She would love to see you, you know?

56
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
Her house smells like cat piss.

57
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
You smell like cat piss.

58
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,800
Hands on experience, a pitch and a tent.

59
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,900
We let you handle the poles,
we let you spread the canopy.

60
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Franks Killer Tour.

61
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,800
We'll teach you how to start a fire!

62
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,500
Rub the sticks together to get a spark.

63
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Wait... Killer Tours!

64
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Experience the terror that was
the Jason Voorhees playground.

65
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,900
Killer tours!

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,400
We knocked those other guys out of the woods!

67
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,200
Legend 57!

68
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Killer tours!

69
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,200
We are now going live with Cameron Weber of KIMA.

70
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,508
Alright, so I'm standing here
with sheriff Jason Realotti,

71
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,350
...who has just agreed to give us a little bit
more information about those bear attacks.

72
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Dad left you a note on the table.

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,300
Did the medical examiner of
Wessex County, did they confirm...

74
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:35,950
...that these are in fact bear attacks
that killed those young victims?

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,889
They confirmed it, and that's why we
released that information to the public.

76
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,275
What do you think I'm running
here? An amateur department?

77
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:43,236
But what about the rumors?
What about the rumors...

78
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,200
-...that there's a homicide investigation?
-Angelica,

79
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,500
...please look after your sister.
I don't know when I'll be home.

80
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,150
-Now if you'll excuse me.
-He's back.

81
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,480
But we actually know that there is
a homicide investigation pending.

82
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,200
-Dad's saying when he's coming home?
-Later.

83
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,200
-Later when?
-Just later, okay?

84
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,500
Fine, whatever.

85
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
But what about Jason.

86
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,900
You know Jason Voorhees?

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,650
Do people need to be worried.

88
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,200
Now you listen to me, you little fuck.

89
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm the real Jason, I'm the real Jason
you got to worry about in this town,

90
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,016
...and you just crossed over the
fucking line. And you know what?

91
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,900
Pack up your fucking shit and get off my sidewalk.

92
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,150
-Is there anything else you want to add?
-I'm just saying that you don't understand?

93
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Pack up your shit and get off my fucking sidewalk!

94
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,550
We apologize for the colorful language,
but that is one of the perils of live television.

95
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,900
Now what you're looking at here is
what we recorded earlier at Crystal Lake.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,900
The young woman being worked on by the
paramedics has been identified as Milla Wiggins,

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,700
...the sole survivor of the vicious attack.

98
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,100
The names of the other three victims
should be released sometime this afternoon...

99
00:09:55,101 --> 00:09:57,201
...once all other families have been notified.

100
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,260
Police and investigators are still on scene,

101
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:03,100
...so they're advising everyone to stay
out of the area until further notice.

102
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,986
-Hello?
-Hey, Gigi. It's Angelica.

103
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:31,700
Oh, Angelica. I was wondering
when I was gonna hear from you.

104
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Are you and Ashley at your dad's?

105
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,350
Yeah, a couple of days now.

106
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,114
Oh, you have to come visit.

107
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:41,900
That'd be great. I was just wondering
if you'd talked to dad today.

108
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,700
No. Why?

109
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,000
No, he just wasn't home when Ash
and me got back a while ago.

110
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I was just trying to track him down, that's all.

111
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,500
If I hear from him, I'll have him call you.

112
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Great. Thank you. And, um,

113
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,250
...we'll come by soon, I promise.

114
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,200
-I should probably go get dinner started...
-Okay, dear. Tell Ashley hi for me.

115
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,600
I will. Bye, Gigi. Thank you.

116
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
Realotti, what are you up to now?

117
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,800
You sneaky son of a bitch.

118
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,600
Hello? Who is this and how
did you get this number?

119
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700
Robert, where are you?

120
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,900
-Who is this?
-It's Angelica.

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Angelica? Hey! What's up?
How are you? How are things?

122
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,200
Where are you?

123
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,600
I am at the coffee shop doing
some research around my book.

124
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,500
-What's up?
-My dad's missing.

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,900
-What?
-My dad's missing.

126
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,800
Okay. Hey, stay there.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

127
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,465
-Excuse me, sir.
-Hey, Brooker, what's up?

128
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:05,193
How do you want to handle all the
media attention that these, uh,

129
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,940
...Camp Crystal Lake murders have been getting?

130
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,270
Nothing's gonna change. Believe me.

131
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:15,400
Those K-I-M-A cock-suckers are gonna
try to stir up shit no matter what we do.

132
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,890
What about the bear attack story?

133
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,689
We stick with it. What are we gonna do?
I mean, it's my official story.

134
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,590
If I change it now, the press will be
up my ass more than they were before.

135
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,770
I can't change it.

136
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,005
What if more bodies start showing up?

137
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,170
That's a big if. If, you know what I mean,
we'll deal with it, when the time comes.

138
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:34,730
And then, you know what?

139
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:39,921
And then the media can move on to some other
bullshit story that they got in their pockets.

140
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,165
Got it. Thank you, sir.

141
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,075
Man, kind of pissed like a racehorse.

142
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,320
Hey, baby. You want to see the horse part?

143
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,830
Hey, where are you going?

144
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,130
Come back. I'll clean your place and sit down.

145
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,036
Hey, kid!

146
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,600
Got a smoke?

147
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,065
Bullshit.

148
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Damn.

149
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,800
-Hey, you put the tail on tailgate.
-Asshole!

150
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh, you brought the buns, I brought the meat.

151
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:27,215
-Fuck off!
-Damn. She's a tough bitch.

152
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,700
Best you put your tampon in with a Nerf gun.

153
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,800
Never mind sugar. Looks like you
got a little smoky anyway.

154
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,600
-He's getting you.
-Ah, shit.

155
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,750
I didn't know the damn squirrel
scouts was going to be here.

156
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,935
A little early in the day
to be this drunk, ain't it, Louis?

157
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh, shit, you're right.
I guess I need another beer.

158
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,607
Another beer here!

159
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,595
Hey, you want one officer...

160
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,500
...Fucker?

161
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:55,180
-I don't think so.
-Alright, I'll take yours.

162
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,600
-Two beers here!
-Come on, Louis. Let's go.

163
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:01,160
-Game's not over.
-It is for you.

164
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,600
Alright, make them beers to go.

165
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,770
Give me your keys.

166
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, you driving?

167
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:10,855
Yeah, I'm driving.

168
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,500
-Hey.
-Hey.

169
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,040
What is going on? You said your
dad's missing. How do you know?

170
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,400
He's back.

171
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,000
-Wait. Does he mean...
-He does.

172
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,120
Jason fucking Voorhees.

173
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,900
Yeah... And you know, this is so typical of him.

174
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:54,925
I mean, the minute we're here, suddenly he's got
a new mission and has to run off and save the day.

175
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,200
This is fucking incredible.

176
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,415
-Just...
-What?

177
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,250
-I don't want Ash to hear.
-She doesn't know?

178
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,705
She doesn't care.

179
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,743
She didn't even want to come here to begin with,

180
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,400
...but she never sees him anymore
since visitation was taken away.

181
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,750
-So it's...
-Yeah, that's rough.

182
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,285
-Yeah, well, he's fucking crazy.
-Your dad's not crazy.

183
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:21,500
Okay? There's no way he wouldn't be here
unless there's something really going on.

184
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,180
You hear about that shit that's
happening at Forest Green?

185
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:30,500
Yeah, yeah. I bet you that's where he went.

186
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,090
Uh-huh. But... Realotti said it was a bear.

187
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,840
Realotti's full of shit, okay?

188
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:39,735
A bear randomly hunts down and kills three people.
You honestly believe that?

189
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,700
-Unlike you and my dad, yeah.
-Yeah, unlike the crazy ones, right?

190
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,195
I know it's been 30 years,
but why couldn't it be Jason?

191
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,000
Just help me find him. And get him back here
before he hurts himself or worse.

192
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:56,505
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,300
I know some people who can help.

194
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,210
Everything will be okay. We'll find him.

195
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,400
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

196
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:09,255
-Okay?
-Yeah.

197
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,711
Are you ready for the thrills and chills...

198
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:36,202
...of the epic Legends 57 Killer Tour?

199
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:40,480
We've taken the liberty of having
your gear already hauled to the campsite.

200
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,985
So in just a few moments, we'll begin our tour.

201
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,090
Yeah, let's hope so.

202
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,080
I mean, we saw the other ghost tour
was ten bucks cheaper.

203
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,200
You guys just had the higher rating.

204
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:58,400
-Don't disappoint.
-Oh, we won't. I guarantee it.

205
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,000
Thomas lowered his prices again, huh?

206
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:04,000
He's got to do something to compete.
We keep poaching his customers.

207
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,743
Bastard.

208
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, he's leading a tour
up here this weekend too.

209
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
Yeah, I heard.

210
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:13,000
You don't think he's going to
get in our way, do you?

211
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,744
No, I'm not worried about
a guy leading a ghost tour...

212
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,115
...who's too afraid to go into
the woods after dark.

213
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,700
Now, this is one of the most important spots
on our Camp Crystal Lake Horror tours.

214
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,260
So prepare yourselves...

215
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,555
...for skin crawling chills.

216
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,065
If you're quiet enough, you can hear the screams
of Jason Vorhees' tormented victims.

217
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:43,500
Yeah, no, I think those are the screams
of your tormented customers.

218
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,880
She's...

219
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,400
I like it. I like it. That's good.
Where was I?

220
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,630
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. What is that noise?

221
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,800
Is that Jason Vorhees coming to kill us?

222
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, God, I hope so.

223
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,580
I think it is.

224
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,545
God, you friggin' idiot!

225
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,757
Who does that? Seriously.

226
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,040
-Yeah, I just pissed myself.
-See what you did?

227
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,665
That's not even a good costume.

228
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,132
A little kickstart to your heart,
ladies and gentlemen.

229
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:21,110
This is our other guy that will be
joining us for today, Alex Joiner.

230
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:23,850
Hi, guys. I'm sorry for the scare.

231
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,400
All right, up next on our trail, we have...

232
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,035
..oh, yeah, this is the same part where
Pamela Voorhees chased our next victim.

233
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:36,155
And where Jason Voorhees...

234
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,944
...went on a rampage and started to kill...

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,900
...after he saw his mother decapitated.

236
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,200
And he kept hearing her voice in his head,

237
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,600
...and she said, kill for me.

238
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,200
Kill for me, Jason.

239
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,895
And he went crazy. And he did.
He did. He killed any and everyone.

240
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,300
So what do you guys think?

241
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,000
Meh. At least that costume's a little better.

242
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,200
Yeah?

243
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Fuck.

244
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,330
Oh fuck! Oh fuck!

245
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,105
Look, seriously, guys. I paid
600 fucking dollars on this.

246
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,100
How is this going to be any different
from those ghost hunter shows on TV?

247
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
This is going to be fun.

248
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,320
Hmm, will it? They're always just psyching you up,
but nothing ever really happens, you know?

249
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,500
I think it's going to be great.
I'm totally excited.

250
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,910
Oh, yeah?

251
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,300
I didn't mean like that.

252
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah, we'll see.

253
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,700
-What's up with the bat?
-Oh, I ain't fucking around with no bears.

254
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,200
No, seriously, a bear rolls up on me.
It's gonna fucking regret it.

255
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:19,355
All right. All right. Are you ready...

256
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,615
...for the spookiest, most terrifying
tour of your lives?

257
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,570
That's right, gang. There's no other ghost tour
around that compares to this one.

258
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:34,125
So be prepared to be terrified.

259
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
So follow me. Let's get this tour on the road.

260
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:41,075
Let's go...

261
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,900
What? How did you even do that?
Oh, it's so not fair.

262
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,400
-Hey, Rob, they're here.
-All right.

263
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,600
Hey, thank you for taking it
easy on me, Ash, all right?

264
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,340
I won't next time, you better practice.

265
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,165
Okay, I will.

266
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay, Rob. What's going on?

267
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,100
Hey, guys.

268
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Thank you so much for the quick response.

269
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,400
Yeah, of course. So, what's the emergency?

270
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,795
Um, well, Angelica here just
found out her dad is missing.

271
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,100
He may be in trouble. I think you all can help.

272
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,270
Angie, this is Jeff Dier,

273
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,400
-...Joey Higgins, and Heather Field.
-Wait, what?

274
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,687
As in the people that my dad has...

275
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,935
As in everyone here has had
family affected by Jason Voorhees.

276
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,405
Yes.

277
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:48,789
-Robert, you know how I feel about this.
-Just hear me out this one time, Angie, okay?

278
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:54,055
-Jason killed his aunt Sandra.
-And my uncle Rob.

279
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,540
He went hunting for Jason and didn't come home.

280
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,200
Her mother was one of the few people to see
Jason before he went on his killing spree.

281
00:22:02,895 --> 00:22:07,100
And her Aunt Jenny survived him face to face.

282
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,030
She actually stopped him once.

283
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,400
Okay, so how does Angelica fit in all this?

284
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:15,439
Everyone...

285
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,410
...I'd like you to meet Angelica Jarvis.

286
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:23,080
Wait, your dad is the Tommy Jarvis?

287
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,019
Yeah.

288
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,700
Jesus, man, he is like a
living legend around here.

289
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:29,790
Well, he's missing.

290
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:33,600
He thinks Jason is back and
he's probably gone after him.

291
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,100
-Again...
-This is what we've been waiting for, right?

292
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,600
An opportunity to clear our family name,

293
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:43,300
-...expose the truth.
-You mean an opportunity to find Angelica's dad?

294
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,960
Yes, but...

295
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:47,678
We all live with the same stigma, right?

296
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,590
-Every one of us.
-Exactly.

297
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:54,915
We find Tommy, but if that
son of a bitch is out there again,

298
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,754
...at least we come back with some proof.

299
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,615
I've interviewed everyone
I could about the attacks.

300
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,047
Jeff, Joey, and Heather are the only three,

301
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:06,000
...been waiting and preparing for this day.

302
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,676
A day to fight back.

303
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:12,670
And we all know that your dad
will do the same for us.

304
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,300
All right, we'll go into search mission
to find your dad, okay?

305
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,000
If this really is Jason and we
actually find him. What's the plan?

306
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,425
Right.

307
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,165
Guns.

308
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,655
A whole fuckin' lot of them.

309
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,000
Hey, I was almost to level seven.

310
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,340
Ash, I need to go somewhere for a little bit.

311
00:23:50,386 --> 00:23:53,017
I'm gonna drive you over to
Donna Elaine's house, okay?

312
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:54,325
How come?

313
00:23:54,326 --> 00:23:57,120
My friends and I have something
very important we need to do.

314
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,250
-Can't I come with you?
-No, this is adult stuff.

315
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,471
But I can help.

316
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:05,190
No, sweetie, you have fun with
Donna tonight. I'll be back tomorrow.

317
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:08,571
What about our sister's summer?
I thought you said family first.

318
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:11,220
Now you're going to hang out with your friends?

319
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,220
It's not like that.

320
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:19,025
This is about dad, isn't it?

321
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:25,050
I'll explain everything later, okay?

322
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,160
Hey, Jim, you hear about this one?

323
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:36,050
What's worse than ants in your pants?

324
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I don't know, Chad. What?

325
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,400
-Uncles.
-Uncles? That's what you come up with?

326
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,400
-Come on. Now I can see why your wife hates you.
-Nah, she don't hate me.

327
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,477
She's just glad I'm out here
with the rest of you guys.

328
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:50,965
-Yeah, is that what she's telling you?
-Nah.

329
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,430
How about this one? So this guy with his premature
ejaculation problem just comes out of nowhere.

330
00:24:57,615 --> 00:24:59,400
Jesus, Chad. Seriously?

331
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,065
Come on, I could have stayed back at the
camp back there with Dave and Bob.

332
00:25:05,465 --> 00:25:08,050
I think I just heard something.

333
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,715
Jesus Christ.

334
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,590
-No.
-You lost?

335
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,230
Are you boys lost?

336
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,635
-Camping?
-Yeah, right over there.

337
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,850
Hey, this is dad's. You can't lose this.

338
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Come on. Let's go.

339
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,600
Hey, look. Have fun tonight, okay?

340
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,400
Be a kid. Play video games all night.

341
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,700
-I love you. You know that, right?
-Yeah.

342
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,900
Kelly, what do you think is wrong with it?

343
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:28,815
I don't know.

344
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,400
-We're gonna be late for the tour.
-Girl, it's your piece of shit car.

345
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,430
-You don't even have a car.
-Girl, try it again.

346
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,900
Hey, hey. I think I got it.

347
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,600
Now, does anybody here have
any experience in erecting a tent?

348
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,100
Uh, sir, I think I'm pitching my tent right now.

349
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,500
More like a pup tent.

350
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,500
Why don't you come on up here, David, and
show your fellow campers how to pitch a tent?

351
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,700
I think that's something we'd all like to see.

352
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,900
Well, uh, first, you're gonna need a babe.

353
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,370
Or a good website.

354
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,350
You know, I find that sweatpants
do the best work in these situations.

355
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,686
All right, all right.

356
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:28,290
I think there's some confusion about what
kind of tent we're going to erect here.

357
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,915
Luckily, we have Dean here,
who is a master of erecting a tent.

358
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:35,945
Darn right I am, Frank.
Now, the key to pitching a tent,

359
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,210
...make sure you got your rigging down.

360
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,290
Now, it might seem a little limp at first,

361
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:44,065
...but don't worry about that.
The more you work it, the stiffer it gets.

362
00:27:44,615 --> 00:27:47,515
-Here, go and take the tip, Frank.
-Here, take the tip. -Thank you.

363
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,911
Marilyn, you hold the middle.

364
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:52,500
As you see, I continue working it.
And look how long that's getting.

365
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:56,250
So long, so firm. This is how
you want to pitch a tent.

366
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,200
-Inside?
-Not really.

367
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,430
-But you just said...
-That's what Angelica wants me to do.

368
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,640
What I'm going to do is follow her.

369
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:10,100
Got an extra bike?

370
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,620
Hey, mom, I'm going to spend
the night at Ashley's tonight.

371
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:31,229
You gonna have to do all
the talking, right, Angie?

372
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,505
Yeah.

373
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,375
If she knows where my dad is,
she has to tell us, right?

374
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,318
She might not want to.

375
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:45,000
Hey. You got this.

376
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,810
Yeah.

377
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,975
-Dr Crews, do you have a couple minutes?
-This is about your father, isn't it?

378
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:02,200
Yeah.

379
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Where is your father, anyway?

380
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,300
That's what I was hoping you would tell me.

381
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,400
I recognize you three.

382
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,500
I think you know my aunt, Jenny.

383
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:20,200
That's it. And you're Jeff Dier
and Joey Higgins, correct?

384
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,825
So what is this all about?

385
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,600
My dad's missing. He thinks Jason is back,
and he's probably gone after him again.

386
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,700
-Oh, God, Tommy.
-You know more than anyone about all of this.

387
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,900
And so, well, we hoped you would
know how we could find him.

388
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,905
-And help him kill Jason?
-No.

389
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:39,400
Yes.

390
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,850
You honestly don't believe
all these stories, do you?

391
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,400
God, no, no, I don't. But my dad does.

392
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,480
-All right. How do we kill Jason?
-You've been studying all of this for ages.

393
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,900
And that probably means you know
how to kill him once and for all, right?

394
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,600
-Right?
-Please, both of you, stop it.

395
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,450
Your father will come back like he always does,

396
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,300
...and I'll be happy to continue to counsel him.

397
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,400
He desperately needs it, and I know you know that.

398
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,755
All of you, just go home.

399
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:14,800
This is a huge waste of our time.
We just should go to Crystal Lake.

400
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:18,120
Crystal Lake is a very dangerous
place, incredibly so.

401
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,915
If there is something going on there,
you need to let the police handle it.

402
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,675
Do you really think sheriff Realotti
could do anything to help?

403
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:30,703
I am so sorry we bothered you, dr Crews.
We'll be going now.

404
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:33,275
-I sure hope you know what to...
-Thank you for your time.

405
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,600
Hi. Dr Crews... I...

406
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,400
I would absolutely love to interview you sometime.

407
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,555
And you are?

408
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,405
Robert Thompson, author, Truth seeker.

409
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,500
The same Robert Thompson that's
been emailing me for the past year.

410
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,685
Yes, ma'am.

411
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,100
Thanks for stopping by.

412
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,340
Two more weeks of this litter bullshit.

413
00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:12,299
I'm sick and fucking tired
of this orange jumpsuit, man.

414
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,445
-Watch that mouth, inmate.
-Yes, sir.

415
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,430
Von, sir.

416
00:31:17,765 --> 00:31:21,105
So what's the first thing you're going to eat
when you get up out of here?

417
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,575
My wife's cooch.

418
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:27,995
See ya, bro.

419
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,400
I thought you said your wife had
more crabs than a seafood platter.

420
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:35,150
No, no, man. She took care of that.
She's undertaken care. I told you that.

421
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,270
Reggie, Dwight,

422
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:39,560
...less talking and more working.

423
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,640
Ken Slate!

424
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,960
Ken fucking Slate! You hear
me talking to you, inmate?

425
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,730
-What?
-Giving me lip?

426
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,580
Fuck you want, boss.

427
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,400
I want you to pick up the damn pace.

428
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:03,625
Why don't you pick up this? I know, I know.
A little bit too much work for you, right?

429
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,005
Lazy fuck.

430
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:12,100
Yo, Ken, man, you trying
to get landed in solitary?

431
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,678
Man, it's better than sticking
our necks out around here.

432
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,100
What do you mean, man?

433
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,560
Ain't you heard about this place?

434
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:22,630
Fucking Jason Voorhees runs around these woods.

435
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,030
If you stay out here long enough.

436
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:28,245
You likely gone ended up cut in
half by the fucking psychopath?

437
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,900
Yo, Reggie, Reggie, you heard of
Jason Voorhees motherfucker.

438
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Oh, yeah, I heard of him.

439
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,400
He killed a bunch of people up
at Crystal Lake back in the day.

440
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,860
No, no, it was Forest Green, man.
Forest Green. Yeah, yeah.

441
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,055
No shit, because I heard it
happen at Crystal Lake.

442
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,000
It's the same place, you fucking idiots.

443
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:59,515
Well, would you believe this shit?
They never caught him,

444
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,930
-...and he might still be out there somewhere.
-Would you two shut the fuck up?

445
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:06,985
Hey, what the fuck is going on
over there, inmates?

446
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,930
-Hello?
-Is this sheriff Realotti?

447
00:33:38,055 --> 00:33:40,390
-The one and only, who's this?
-Tammy Crews.

448
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,995
You gotta be on lookout. There's a
bunch of kids headed up to Crystal Lake.

449
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, oh, oh, I remember you. Eh, listening.

450
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,725
I don't need to be sent on any wild goose chases,

451
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,913
...and I certainly don't need to be
babysitting a bunch of kids.

452
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:58,068
Now, I'm sorry, but if this isn't a
real emergency, my hands are really tied.

453
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,219
I can't do anything.

454
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:03,539
Please, sheriff. You can't spare one deputy?

455
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,704
All right, you know what?
I'll see what I can do, okay?

456
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,710
Thank you, sheriff.

457
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,345
Tucker, you on the air?

458
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Yep, Tucker here, go ahead.

459
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,815
I got a couple of kids up on Cunningham Road...

460
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:27,970
...that are nosing around up there,
that don't belong there.

461
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,500
See what you can do, and if you see them,
send them packing, all right?

462
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,965
Roger that, sir. 10-4.

463
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,700
10-4, sir. My day never ends.

464
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:39,455
Jesus Christ almighty.

465
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,695
What the fuck!

466
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,230
What the fuck! Get away!

467
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
-Oh, my God, that was him.
-No, that was just a bird or something.

468
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,738
No, but what if it was him?

469
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:24,500
-I mean, should we go?
-You can't run it these woods like that.

470
00:35:24,535 --> 00:35:27,695
Jason can already be here. Angelica, wait!

471
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,220
Pull up.

472
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:31,770
-Some kind of animal or something, right?
-Shit, I don't know.

473
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:34,135
Come on. Come on!

474
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,100
Shit. Look at that.

475
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,290
Someone's throwing away a perfectly good Jeep.

476
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,615
Fucking one percent is always wasteful.
Throwing shit away.

477
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Shit color.

478
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,875
Don't mind if I do.

479
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,159
Fucking cop holders.

480
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Hell, yeah!

481
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,300
-Wait. Hold up!
-What?

482
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,225
-That's my car.
-Looks like I'm driving after all, officer Fucker.

483
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:26,805
That's my fucking car.

484
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,780
Fuck.

485
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,200
-Oh, fuck.
-Fuck! You fuck!

486
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,645
Son of a bitch.

487
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:36,980
Fuck!

488
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,540
-Oh, my God.
-Holy shit.

489
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,200
It's fine. I'm sure he has insurance.
You have insurance, right?

490
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,890
Our guns are in that truck.
You fucking asshole.

491
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,158
Oh, shit.

492
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:53,130
What are we going to do now?

493
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,595
Go back and call the cops? I mean,
we can't just go out there unarmed.

494
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:58,585
God, what about my dad?

495
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:00,745
All right. You guys can go back if you want.

496
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,986
All right? I'll stay here with Angelica.

497
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:07,180
-Fuck!
-Wait a second.

498
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,500
Wait, come here.

499
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,190
What about these?

500
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,115
I know it's not much, but...

501
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:18,051
...it's better than nothing, right?

502
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,605
Fuck.

503
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,500
Hey, take this.

504
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,080
-Come on.
-Yeah, okay.

505
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,475
You sure about this?

506
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,300
-I don't know. Yeah?
-Yeah.

507
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,900
All right, we stick together, we'll be fine.

508
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,265
Which way do we go?

509
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,575
I think the quickest way to the camp is this way.

510
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,795
Who put the fucking tree in the
middle of the goddamn road?

511
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:16,469
Four by four, my ass.

512
00:38:18,835 --> 00:38:21,200
What the hell are you doing, dipshit?

513
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,700
What? You think there's a Halloween or something?

514
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:29,255
Hey! Fucking talking to you, Mickey Myers?

515
00:38:31,365 --> 00:38:33,710
What, are you fucking deaf or something?

516
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,775
Get the fuck out of my way.

517
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,740
Jesus Christ. You smell like a
goat queef on a pair of Hillbilly balls.

518
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:44,215
Oy, you think you're fucking tough or something?

519
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:47,025
Hey, get the fuck out of my way.

520
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:49,445
All right.

521
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:29,325
We calling this another bear attack?

522
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,818
No.

523
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,285
-It's obviously an escape attempt that went bad.
-Copy that.

524
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,815
-Realotti wants this mess cleaned up ASAP.
-We're on it.

525
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:42,954
-Go ahead and start getting this taped off.
-You got it.

526
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,605
Brooker, what's your 20?

527
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,140
Hey, Tuck. I'm at the station.
Realotti wants you to get back here.

528
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,157
Yeah, I'm on my way.

529
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:14,137
First I gotta get back out here
and find those kids...

530
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,080
...before I have an even bigger mess to clean up.

531
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,900
What is all that?

532
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,660
It is all of dr Crews' research...

533
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,575
...on the Camp Crystal Lake murders.

534
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,790
I borrowed it from her office.

535
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,362
You stole it?

536
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,930
This is gonna be... incredible for my book.

537
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:40,700
You know what, man? Try not to
be too happy about all this.

538
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,290
No, no, no. You know what? I'm not happy, okay?

539
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,264
I just personally think the world needs to know...

540
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:50,741
...because there are a lot of
goddamn unanswered questions...

541
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,200
...and the good doctor was
holding back quite a lot.

542
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,650
Look, right here. Right here. This details
sightings of Jason in New York.

543
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,365
-No, no way.
-That can't possibly be real.

544
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,776
No, it's total bullshit.
But that's just the thing.

545
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,650
There's all these stories and reports...

546
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,920
...and someone needs to go through it all
and find out what's real and what isn't.

547
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,165
-That's you, right?
-Yeah. Maybe Jeff,

548
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,057
...but maybe not. But regardless,
it needs to happen.

549
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,100
Of course, why not?

550
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,575
I think it's best we keep moving.

551
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,115
Yeah.

552
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:24,225
Come on.

553
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,824
This isn't right.

554
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,295
Maybe we should ditch the bikes
and cut through the woods.

555
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:38,810
It's okay. I was a girl scout.

556
00:41:38,938 --> 00:41:39,884
Okay.

557
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,200
You know, my dad used to bring me
deer hunting up here when I was a kid.

558
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,410
He was fishing up at the lake, too.

559
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:54,600
He always told me never to wander
too close to the old camp.

560
00:41:54,695 --> 00:41:56,071
Did you ever?

561
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,114
When I asked him why we
weren't supposed to go there,

562
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,360
...he told me it was because
of some kind of death curse.

563
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:02,685
What was it like?

564
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:06,615
You'll see for yourself. Soon enough.

565
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,157
Well, we've got a big day tomorrow, folks.

566
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,285
I suggest you youngsters get yourself some sleep.

567
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Okay, suit yourselves.

568
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,500
But the morning comes awful early
when you're out camping.

569
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Don't say I didn't warn you.

570
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,000
See you in the morning, Frank.

571
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,565
That is, if I survive the night.

572
00:42:43,415 --> 00:42:45,095
Night night.

573
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,420
So who's got a scary story for us?

574
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,910
-No one? That's okay. I've got one.
-Great.

575
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:59,350
-I bet this is gonna be good.
-Oh, it's gonna be good.

576
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:02,195
So, here it goes.

577
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,390
What are you doing?

578
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:09,495
If we keep going, we can catch up to them.

579
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,906
Not if we keep going in circles.

580
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,400
What? We weren't.

581
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,640
We passed by this log twice.

582
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:21,400
We're lost. Admit it.

583
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,400
Fine. I'll call Angie.

584
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,310
-Hmm.
-What?

585
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,875
No reception.

586
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,510
Dean?

587
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,100
Better not be playing another one
of your practical jokes.

588
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,700
I shit you not.

589
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,500
It isn't funny asshole.

590
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
You better get it through your head.

591
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:03,200
We're not having a repeat of what
happened at Springwood last year.

592
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,770
You hear me?

593
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,890
Good.

594
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,600
Hey. Cut the lights.

595
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,575
Oh shit.

596
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,400
I recognize the shirts on those too.

597
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,100
It's one of those goddamn haunted tours.

598
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,600
Do you think they know Jason might be here?

599
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,910
Honestly they probably wouldn't even care.
That's the whole point of these stupid tours.

600
00:44:58,915 --> 00:45:01,590
Just the scare the shit out of
people with the legend of Jason.

601
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,885
So, either they'll think we're
messing with them or crazy.

602
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,140
Maybe they seen my dad.

603
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:14,300
You know what? I think maybe,
I might possibly have an idea.

604
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:16,865
Yeah. Follow me.

605
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,400
So all sorts of crazy things in here.
All sudden this gloved hand comes out of the box.

606
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,800
The fuck?

607
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,500
Wait, it gets better. It gets better.

608
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,000
-Hey.
-Holy shit.

609
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Who the hell are you guys?

610
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,500
Sorry to intrude.

611
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,820
But we're camping somewhere around here
and, well, we went for a hike earlier today...

612
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,400
...and got lost.

613
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,020
Got caught out after dark out here, all the time.

614
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
You haven't seen anyone else out here
have you? An older guy, denim jacket?

615
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,200
Can't say I have.

616
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,600
So, you always carry those
with you when you go hiking?

617
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
Just being prepared. There's bears out here.

618
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,485
-I told you bro.
-Whatever man.

619
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,700
Well, why don't you go ahead and join us.

620
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,600
And in the morning I'll help
you guys find your camp.

621
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,790
Dean really is great at land navigation.

622
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,835
I'm sure he'll be able to help
you get back in no time.

623
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,060
That would be great. Thank you.

624
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:26,770
My pleasure.

625
00:46:26,774 --> 00:46:29,491
Now, have a seat and join us for s'mores.

626
00:46:29,642 --> 00:46:32,069
There are plenty to go around.

627
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,070
Thank you.

628
00:46:33,295 --> 00:46:34,919
You sure about this?

629
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:40,085
I'm just trying to put myself in Tommy's
shoes and this is what he would do.

630
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,790
-Right, Angie?
-Yeah, he would.

631
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,479
Hey.

632
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,905
This party's getting kind of crowded you know.

633
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,985
What do you say, you and I,
go for a walk down by the lake?

634
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:12,395
-Sure.
-Yeah.

635
00:47:12,517 --> 00:47:14,433
All right. Let's go.

636
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,310
All right.

637
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:26,511
I'm gonna take a piss.

638
00:47:27,635 --> 00:47:29,200
I'll be right back.

639
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,225
Don't get lost again.
Because you, got lost earlier.

640
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,930
Here's that body cam footage
you've been waiting for, sir.

641
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:46,225
Oh Jesus Christ. Who delivered?
The goddamn pony express?

642
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,045
Nah, alright. I'm really really sorry.
Good night. I have a problem.

643
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,000
No! No!

644
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,100
No! No! Oh, my God!

645
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,960
-I will see you at work.
-See you.

646
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,900
-Hey, Realotti, mind keeping your nuts off of me?
-That's not what you told me last night.

647
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,800
-You're terrible.
-I'm terrible.

648
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,325
And what would your husband think
about a little summer romance, huh?

649
00:48:56,345 --> 00:48:58,514
Our arrangement works well for both of us.

650
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:01,050
I don't ask him what happens
on his business trips,

651
00:49:01,055 --> 00:49:03,900
...and he doesn't ask me what happens here.

652
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,920
Hey, Abigail,

653
00:49:06,715 --> 00:49:08,815
...how about a quickie?

654
00:49:09,495 --> 00:49:11,795
Okay, but not here.

655
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,045
Realotti. Jarvis. What the hell are you two doing?

656
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:28,165
What the fuck? A fucking kid just drowned.
What are you doing?

657
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,200
-What are you talking about?
-The cook's kid, Jason Voorhees.

658
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,922
-Couple of kids saw him go out to the lake...
-Oh my god.

659
00:49:32,923 --> 00:49:35,480
...he went down, he never came back up.
Where the fuck were you two idiots?

660
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,404
Jesus Christ, I swear there was nobody out there.

661
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:39,900
You're supposed to be watching him,
you stupid son of a bitch.

662
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:41,605
Where the hell were you, god damn it?

663
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:43,960
We are so fucked.

664
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,110
-It probably belongs to those kids.
-Want to call this one in?

665
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:58,505
No.

666
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:00,895
Not yet.

667
00:50:01,885 --> 00:50:04,885
Let's take a quick walk around the area
and see if we can find something.

668
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,085
Yeah, well, I got your six.

669
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,514
-Yeah.
-Always.

670
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:23,660
What the fuck?

671
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,830
Fuck it, follow the horny teens... Okay.

672
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,990
Oh, hey, this just got better.

673
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,700
What are you finding in there?

674
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:17,595
A lot.

675
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,800
They never found Jason's body in the lake.

676
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,000
They searched for about a week,

677
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:25,600
...and then his dad...

678
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,225
...Elias Voorhees, called off the search.

679
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,200
He said it didn't matter anymore.

680
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,105
You knew whatever happened to his dad?

681
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:42,115
Uh, passed away.

682
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,335
Alone and grieving from the sound of it.

683
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,050
Sounds like he really loved his kid.

684
00:51:50,765 --> 00:51:52,310
Hello?

685
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,600
What do you mean you can't find him?

686
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,515
No.

687
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,070
No.

688
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:09,390
No!

689
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,875
Maybe they were just a messed up family.

690
00:52:57,895 --> 00:53:02,420
Or maybe all the legend folklore
just made things harder on them all.

691
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,582
It's so strange thinking of Jason having a family.

692
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,425
You know his mom was the original
Crystal Lake Killer, right?

693
00:54:30,554 --> 00:54:33,634
-Does Mary Ann kiss as good as I do?
-How would I know?

694
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,140
You.

695
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:43,349
-I thought you were special.
-I meant everything.

696
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:06,836
Somebody's there.

697
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,099
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing around.

698
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,400
You let my boy drown.

699
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,365
Wow. I think I've had as much excitement
as I can handle for one night.

700
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,530
I'm gonna call it too. Nice to meet you guys.

701
00:56:18,535 --> 00:56:20,835
-Good night!
-Good night!

702
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:32,775
Hello?

703
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,600
-Oh, shit!
-Hey, princess.

704
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:38,500
-Hi.
-Sorry, I scared you.

705
00:56:38,505 --> 00:56:41,505
It's okay. What happened?
I thought you left.

706
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:45,153
Well, I was gonna leave after I set up camp.

707
00:56:45,154 --> 00:56:47,700
But I didn't want to leave you
here alone with the wolves.

708
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,165
You mean Frank and Dean.
They are fun.

709
00:56:51,293 --> 00:56:52,613
I'm more.

710
00:56:55,735 --> 00:56:58,965
I couldn't get my mind off of you all day.

711
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,115
I'm so happy you came back.

712
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,500
I don't think I can keep my
hands off of you either.

713
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:05,505
I hope not.

714
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,400
-Haven't you heard the stories?
-Yeah, but they're just stories.

715
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,200
Not all of them.

716
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,400
-Well, Dean over here is the expert.
-Hardly.

717
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,290
Whatever. Anyway, this conversation
is boring the shit out of me.

718
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,200
Which way is it to the lake?

719
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,903
And you. I think I should probably hit the sack.

720
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:42,400
You're welcome to help yourself
to any of the food.

721
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,685
Thank you for everything, Dean.

722
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:50,200
You're welcome. I'm just sorry I couldn't
make the sleeping situation a little better.

723
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,857
We packed a little bit light.

724
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:54,820
No, we understand. We will be
just fine out here by the fire.

725
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,770
Okey-dokey. Good night then.

726
00:57:57,895 --> 00:57:59,520
Good night.

727
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,080
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah...

728
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,300
We should probably just wait till morning.

729
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,855
I mean,

730
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:13,995
...it's safer with us as a group,
right? Safety in numbers?

731
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,900
Yeah, but that was before.
The situation has obviously changed.

732
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,130
And why the hell aren't Jeff
or those other two back yet?

733
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:22,820
I want to stay by the fire.

734
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:25,201
I'm sorry, I can't just go gallivanting
through the dark.

735
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,000
I'll wait for Jeff.

736
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,400
-Are you sure, Heather?
-Yeah.

737
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,300
If anything happens, I'll just
yell for the guy with the bat.

738
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:55,280
Jesus fucking Christ. Just fucking
bone and get it over with.

739
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:05,703
What was that?

740
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,700
Probably just those guys messing with us.

741
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,030
Ha-ha, guys! Real fucking funny.

742
01:00:15,214 --> 01:00:16,241
Fuck.

743
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,495
There's someone over there!

744
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:22,625
Just stay here, okay?

745
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:24,180
All right?

746
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,300
Now he's being shy.

747
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,995
Sorry baby. That cold water shrinked my pod.

748
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,535
David?

749
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:52,165
You want to cock block me,
you motherfucker? Oh shit.

750
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:56,535
Holy shit. Oh shit!

751
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,811
It's uh, Realotti and... holy shit!

752
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:13,215
-This can't be true.
-What?

753
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,250
What the hell did you find?

754
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,025
Angie, your great grandma and Realotti,

755
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,300
...they started this.

756
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,991
-They started all of this.
-What are you talking about?

757
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:24,710
Look,

758
01:01:25,165 --> 01:01:29,190
...they were the counselors on duty
when Jason Voorhees drowned.

759
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,725
It's their fault. They've been
covering this up for years.

760
01:01:57,055 --> 01:02:01,555
How, um, how could she let all this
happen and never say anything?

761
01:02:01,945 --> 01:02:04,800
Fucking Realotti sleep at night,

762
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:07,900
...covering this shit up all this time.

763
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,960
Okay,

764
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
...fuck.

765
01:02:16,855 --> 01:02:18,630
Let's go.

766
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,660
I don't see no lake around here.

767
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,320
Fuck.

768
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,800
Okay, maybe I should go back.

769
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,400
Yeah, I should go back.

770
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:46,400
What?

771
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:51,730
Yo! You a bear?

772
01:02:54,055 --> 01:02:56,900
Nah. Like a bear to me.

773
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:02,290
Shit.

774
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,915
What kind of name is Flora anyway?
It sounds like an old maid.

775
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,730
What kind of name is Abigail?

776
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,863
Oh, it's just like a southern bear.

777
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,480
From hell.

778
01:03:19,665 --> 01:03:22,900
Yeah, you're taking care of Archie.

779
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,600
Yes.

780
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:29,045
I don't know why. Because I'm nice.

781
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,720
Oh, BS.

782
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,400
Archie, you silly cat. You only
come home from meal time, do you?

783
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,900
Abigail!

784
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,030
Jesus Christ.

785
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,600
You! You let my boy die.

786
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,760
Fuck you, Voorhees! You're evil!

787
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,655
-Saying that you don't understand.
-Exactly.

788
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,200
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

789
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:04,035
Damn it. Are you kidding me?

790
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,300
Kids? That gave me a fucking heart attack.

791
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Language.

792
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,400
Hey, What are you girls doing here by yourself?

793
01:04:15,295 --> 01:04:18,115
It's okay, you can talk to us.
You're not gonna get in any trouble.

794
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,315
-What about my sister?
-What about your sister, hun?

795
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:23,865
I don't want to get her in trouble.

796
01:04:24,765 --> 01:04:27,405
Her sister out here somewhere?

797
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,460
Is she with friends?

798
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:35,735
Yeah, I knew it. Damn kids are out here
somewhere up to no good.

799
01:04:36,265 --> 01:04:40,400
They think my dad is out here somewhere,
so they went looking for him.

800
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:45,055
So we came up with a plan to follow them.
But we got lost.

801
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,900
She got lost.

802
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,520
Who's your dad, kid?

803
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,025
Tommy Jarvis.

804
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,900
All right.

805
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:01,556
You take them back to the rig, and I'm just
gonna keep searching for these guys out here.

806
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:02,600
Yeah.

807
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,100
Yeah, okay, well, just keep
your radio on, all right?

808
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,865
Okay.

809
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,900
Come on, girls, let's go.

810
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,865
You let my boy drown.

811
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,055
I knew this day would come,
you fucking son of a bitch.

812
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,400
Jason, don't!

813
01:06:12,525 --> 01:06:15,325
Jason, mother is talking to you.

814
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:22,360
That's my good boy.

815
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,700
It's okay.

816
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,990
Everything's gonna be okay.

817
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,000
-I'm not worried about that.
-I know you are not, but...

818
01:06:55,885 --> 01:06:58,985
Hey, okay, guys, I'm just gonna go ahead
and check out this path ahead...

819
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,500
...make sure it's safe for us to go down,
alright? You girls should stay here.

820
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,495
What is it?

821
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,771
Um, I'm sure it's nothing.
I'm sure it's gonna be okay, but...

822
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,905
...you girls should stay here,
alright? I'll be right back.

823
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:11,565
Hey, brave like your dad. Okay.

824
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:28,056
No!

825
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,925
Run!

826
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,043
Fuck.

827
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:08,965
Brooker, do you copy?

828
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:13,500
God damn it, Brookie, you better not
be fuckin' with me right now.

829
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,220
Brooker, if you can hear me
but can't talk, just cue Mic.

830
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,400
Oh, I'm here.

831
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,500
I never thought I'd come, but here it is.

832
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,400
Maybe we should have waited
back at the campsite for Jeff.

833
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,145
I really don't like the looks of this place.

834
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,140
Alright,

835
01:09:55,429 --> 01:09:57,208
...let's see if this works.

836
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,100
Oh, whoa. This is it.

837
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:11,730
This is where it all happened.

838
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,485
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
stay out here and keep watch.

839
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,875
Are you sure?

840
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,760
-Yeah.
-Alright.

841
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,290
Keep your eyes and ears open,

842
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:48,200
...and if you need anything, holler...

843
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:49,860
...or scream.

844
01:10:51,075 --> 01:10:54,975
I'm just saying, given the current
situation, it's a valid suggestion.

845
01:10:56,045 --> 01:11:00,745
Yeah, I'll be fine. Go ahead.

846
01:11:02,865 --> 01:11:04,865
Yeah, okay.

847
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,590
Shit, I really don't feel like falling
through the floor in here.

848
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,700
Just walk lightly. It should be okay.

849
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:27,390
Yeah.

850
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:46,800
Alright, I've seen enough.

851
01:11:47,435 --> 01:11:52,100
-Should we go out and check the rest of the camp?
-Hold on.

852
01:11:58,505 --> 01:12:01,465
-Ready?
-Yeah.

853
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,280
Heather?

854
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Jeff? Is that you?

855
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,250
-Oh, my god.
-What is it?

856
01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:32,360
-This is dads. He was here.
-Are you sure. That looks like it's years old?

857
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,400
No, no, I fell and I smashed this on a rock.
I put that dent in there when I was eight.

858
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:47,385
You might be right, Angie. What if he
tried to escape through that window.

859
01:12:47,955 --> 01:12:49,155
What?

860
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,600
It was him.

861
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,400
Oh fuck! He's...

862
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,300
-He's dead. He's dead...
-No, no, no, no...

863
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:06,250
You don't understand.

864
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,100
-No, he's dead. He is dead!
-Come here. Come here. No, he's not dead.

865
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:13,400
He's not dead. He's still here.
He's still out there. He's still out there.

866
01:13:13,835 --> 01:13:15,935
He's still out there.

867
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,900
Look at me. It's okay.
He's still out there. I know it.

868
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,300
He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay.

869
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,800
You know what? Fuck this.

870
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,500
Joey!

871
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,500
-Joey!
-Joey!

872
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,085
Fuck!

873
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,425
-You go check out the other lake, the lake.
-No, wait, we can't split up.

874
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,725
-Just go, go!
-Angelica!

875
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,735
Fuck! Fuck! This is not good. Fuck.

876
01:14:05,719 --> 01:14:07,259
Oh, shit!

877
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:22,955
It's deputy Tucker!

878
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,790
If anybody's in range and can hear this.
I'm at Crystal Lake, need emergency back up.

879
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,000
Oh, my... Joey! Okay...

880
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:37,200
Okay, okay. Fuck.

881
01:14:37,205 --> 01:14:39,600
Fuck.

882
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,500
No! No, no, no...

883
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,150
Joey...

884
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,455
Angelica!

885
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:00,050
Joey!

886
01:15:00,655 --> 01:15:02,655
Anybody!

887
01:16:17,425 --> 01:16:18,330
No!

888
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,600
Leave my sister alone!

889
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:43,270
Kill them, Jason!

890
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:50,145
Kill them!

891
01:16:50,985 --> 01:16:53,185
Kill them all!

892
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,600
Kill them, boy!

893
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:23,689
You're not my boy.

894
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,700
It's okay, it's okay, it's good.
You're alright.

895
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,500
So I could use...

896
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:15,500
We get you out of here.
Is he with you?

897
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,900
Who is he?

898
01:18:18,085 --> 01:18:19,580
Fuck.

899
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:23,589
It's Deputy Tucker, I've got two bodies.

900
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,120
I've got one body.

901
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,400
Where'd he go?

902
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,900
Alright, let's get you out of here.

903
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,100
Let's get you out of here.

904
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:48,385
Come on. Come on. Let's go!

905
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Let's go.

906
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,400
Hey, Tucker. Give me a second.

907
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,600
Those two individuals you were
asking me about earlier.

908
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I don't have anything on them.

909
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,900
Now, as Tom Jarvis, he is not on the list.

910
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,600
However, Elias Voorhees...

911
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,285
...there are three death certificates we have...

912
01:19:50,309 --> 01:19:53,095
...from three different counties.

913
01:19:53,515 --> 01:19:56,195
What do you think of that?

914
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,275
-There's still that shit in rig.
-This is nuts.

915
01:20:00,445 --> 01:20:03,545
Yeah, if you'd seen what I'd seen.

916
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,620
Hey kiddo.

917
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:07,940
Where's your sister?

918
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,200
-Hey.
-Did you find him?

919
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,120
We've got good news.

920
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:23,445
Well, the good news is, is that Tommy Jarvis
is not on our list of deceased.

921
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:30,265
Okay, that means he's still
out there, he's alive, right?

922
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:31,845
I did not say that.

923
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,810
All we know right now is he is not
on our list of deceased.

924
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,700
Dad?

925
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,400
It's dad. It's really him.
Where are you?

926
01:20:50,055 --> 01:20:54,080
-What? I can't hear you.
-Ashley, let me see your phone.

927
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,100
Give me the phone.

928
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,795
Tommy. Tommy, can you hear me?

929
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,200
Tommy?

930
01:21:02,755 --> 01:21:04,755
What did he say?

931
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,035
-We gotta get back out there.
-All right, let's go.

932
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:10,375
What did he say? Where is he?

933
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,250
I don't know.

934
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,600
I can't understand him.

935
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,700
Hey, it's okay.

936
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,300
Hey.

937
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:45,300
Don't worry. We will find your dad.

938
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,800
Join us...
