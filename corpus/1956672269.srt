00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:51,118
When you're underwater
for months at a time,

3
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,383
<i>you lose all sense
of day and night.</i>

4
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:57,817
<i>And there's only awake
and dreaming.</i>

5
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,617
<i>Not that those things
are easy to tell apart.</i>

6
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:08,584
<i>I think,</i>

7
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:10,550
<i>or I dream about
the first thing</i>

8
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,817
<i>he ever said to me.</i>

9
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,717
<i>Told me he didn't
believe in time...</i>

10
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:22,383
<i>only moments.</i>

11
00:05:23,884 --> 00:05:25,617
Hmm.

12
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,017
<i>He was a
glass-half-full type.</i>

13
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:29,250
All right.

14
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,884
<i>I prefer it empty.</i>

15
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,350
What are you doing here?

16
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,317
<i>I mean, there's a
comfort to cynicism.</i>

17
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,717
<i>There's a lot
less to lose.</i>

18
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:12,017
Wake up!

19
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,650
Pressure breach!

20
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,283
Pressure breach!
We gotta get to the bulkhead!

21
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:20,751
Structural
integrity compromised.

22
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,617
Everyone up! Everyone up!
Come on!

23
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,575
Structural integrity

24
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,343
What the hell is happening?

25
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:03,642
Let's go! Pressure breach!

26
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:08,009
We gotta seal the bulkhead!

27
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,375
<i>De-pressurization

28
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,842

- <i>De-pressurization warning.</i>
- I don't have my keycard!

30
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,508
Here, here, here.

31
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:19,042
- No!
- <i>Bulkhead jammed.</i>

32
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,276
I gotta get inside
this thing now!

33

- <i>Reboot required.</i>
- Where is it? Where is it?

34
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,343
Oh, my God!

35
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:28,042
Come on!

36
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:31,675
De-pressurization warning.
Seal the bulkhead.

37
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,542
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,809
The whole rig
is about to implode!

39
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,042
If you don't shut these doors,

40
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,542
it'll take the whole station
with us!

41
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,575
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
got it, got it, got it!

42
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:41,942
- <i>System online.</i>
- Shut the door!

43
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:44,109
- Wait!
- Hey, hey, hey.

44
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,109
Wait for us!

45
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:45,942
- Hey!
- Run!

46
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,475
- Run!
- Come on!

47
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,176
Guys, run! Come on, come on!

48
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:51,042
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Come on, guys, let's go!

49
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:52,508
Come on, run!

50
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,575
Norah, Norah!
They're not gonna make it.

51
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,343
- Close the door!
- Norah!

52
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:58,542
We have to close the door,
otherwise the whole rig will die.

53
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,742
Shut the door now!

54
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:53,408
<i>Structural failure is imminent</i>

<i>Repeat, structural

00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,176
Hey, hey.

60
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,076
You okay?

61
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,809
Was that an earthquake?

62
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:18,876
I don't know.

63
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,609
Had to have been like
a ten or eleven.

64
00:10:24,742 --> 00:10:26,909
I don't even know
what channel we'd be...

65
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,475
<i>All personnel

66
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,343

Can anyone hear me?

74
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,076
We have to get to the pod bays.

75
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:03,408
Come on.

76
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,675
As a crew
member, we want you to know

77
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,709
<i>that you're not
just part of a team,</i>

78

<i>you're part of

79
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,842
No, no, no.
That doesn't go through.

80
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,309
<i>Have
a complaint?</i>

81
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,709
<i>Address it
to your superior officer.</i>

82
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,642
Oh, yes, working.

83
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,009
I just got to find
the nearest pods.

84
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:40,909
Senior engineers,
please report to engineering.

85
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,976
Rodrigo, right?

86
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:44,909
Yeah.

87
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:46,475
Norah.

88
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:48,709
I-I know.

89
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,475
I usually work
with the day shift.

90
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:55,976
- Can you...? Can you help me out here?
- Sure, I can.

91
00:11:55,976 --> 00:12:00,642
Um, are you a computer engineer
or something?

92
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,343
- Mechanical.
- Okay.

93
00:12:02,343 --> 00:12:03,609
I can reset breakers.

94
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,709
I've been down here for a bit.

95
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,475
Hey, you gotta know...

96
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,809
that wasn't our fault.

97
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,009
I mean,
you-you saved the entire rig.

98
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,942
I... I didn't even know
to close the door.

99
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:24,842
Hmm.

<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

101
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:35,876
Do you... Do you really think
that was an earthquake?

102
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:36,709
No.

103
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,775
I-I don't know.

104
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:43,742
That's not good.

105
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,942
The hardline's been severed.

106
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:49,408
Antenna's gone. I don't even
think we can reach the surface.

107
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:52,042
...to the nearest
escape pod as soon as possible.

108
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:54,142
There's-there's
evac pods in CR-7.

109
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,142
Hey, we got this, all right?

110
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,809
Some of this water
is definitely sewage.

111
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,309

aboard the Kepler Station,

<i>and we hope
you enjoy your stay.</i>

117
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:42,609
Can we...
Can we dig through there?

118
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:44,408
I'll look inside.

119
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,408
Yeah, I can fit up here,
if you can.

120
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,475
Come check.

121
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,276
Hello?

122
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:09,542

123
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:13,542
Hello? Hello?

124
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,109
Hey, do you hear that?

125
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:17,009
- Hey!
- Hello!

126
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,675
Hey, keep talking, man.
I can hear you.

127
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,742
I'm under the rock!

128
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,675
Take him, take him.

129
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,742
Paul? Here, here, here, here.
Hey, you.

130
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,575
What's-what's going on
down there? Your legs all right?

131
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:34,475
- Yeah.
- Okay.

132
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,675
What do you need?

133
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,976
To get the heck out of here.

134
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,709
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What can I do?

135
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,076
- All right, all right.
- All right.

136
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:43,609
- You good?
- Yeah.

137
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,809
All right.

138
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:46,842
- All right. Here.
- Hey.

139
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:49,209

Yes.

- Yeah.
- All right, buddy. Here we go.

146
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:02,575
Grab his arm?

147
00:15:02,575 --> 00:15:04,408
No, no, no. Wait. No, no.

148
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,809
Okay, are you caught
in anything?

149
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,142
No, no, no,
let's just be stronger.

150
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,542
Okay.

151
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:14,942
Okay, give me Lil Paul.

152
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:16,076
- Yeah, here.
- Thank you.

153
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,276
Gotta go.

- Okay.

We gotta move fast.

"Shit?" What's...
What's "oh shit"? What?

181
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,942
The evac pods are gone.

182
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:41,709
- I need the line open.
- Captain!

183
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:46,909
Hey!

184
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,209
Norah. You're alive.

185
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,309
Cap.

186
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,508
The door's jammed.

187
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,442
Rodrigo, Paul.

188
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,742
I need you two to check where
we are on submersible. Now.

189
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,176
All right, all right.

190
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:03,109
On a scale from one to ten,
how bad's my rig?

191
00:18:06,142 --> 00:18:07,009
Uh, ten.

192
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:12,209
You're 70% compromised.

193
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,109
Honestly, you-you breathe
too hard in here, we're...

194
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,508
Wait. Let me see.

195
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,109
I don't get it. Was that
like an earthquake or...

196
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,542
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out.

197
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,508
Why are you still here?

198
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,243
You should have gone up.
There were pods here.

199
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,709
'Cause that's what captains do.

200
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,142
Who cares? You have a kid,
you should have gone up.

201
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:37,343
Can you, uh, can you
sit down, please?

202
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:40,609
Any one of us would have
shoved your ass

203
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:41,575
onto that pod immediately.

204
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,809
Listen to me.

205
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,276
Everybody's getting out
of here alive,

206
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:45,442
you hear me?

207
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:46,609
Okay?

208
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,375
Hold that on your ear.

209
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,375
I already sent 22 up.

210
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,508
Smith reported seven dead.

211
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,876
I found three.

212
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:58,609
It was, it was Lee,
Travis and McClellen,

213
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:00,408
and, um, um, McCl...

214
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,775
McClellen's hands
were still warm

215
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,642
so I-I know it was McClellen.

216
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,575
I mean, she lives
three floors up,

217
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:07,542
and I was brushing my teeth,
like, two hours ago.

218
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,276
- I-I had to shut the door on the entire East wing.
- Don't do this to yourself.

219
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,142
So, actually, you know what,
there could be more.

220
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,442
Stop thinking back,
look forward.

221
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,909
Look forward. Look at me.

222
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:18,209
Now you follow the light.
Come on.

223
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,809
Follow the light.
<i>Ça va ça va.</i>

224
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:23,909
<i>Cap,
that isa no-go on the submersibles.</i>

225
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,076
<i>Copy that.</i>

226
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,009
<i>I'm sending Norah
to the control room.</i>

227
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:34,042
Emily, are you okay? Hey.

228
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,475
- Oh, my gosh. You're alive.
- Norah?

229
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,709
- Hey.
- You're alive.

230
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,243
- Dude.
- Ah, I hate that.

231
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,076
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no. Nothing.

232
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:44,909
- How are the cooling towers?
- I haven't checked 'em yet.

233
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:45,976
- You wanna do it?
- Yeah, yeah.

234
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,876
See if anybody's
alive out there.

235
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,475
<i>compromised.</i>

236
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:51,609
<i>Bulkheads closed...</i>

237
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,375
Hey, hey.

238
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,176
Someone's coming. Right?

239
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,709
They're gonna...
They're gonna send someone.

240
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,176
I don't know. Thank you.

241
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,942
I'm pretty sure
they already sent someone.

242
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,976
I'm less sure we have the time
to wait for them.

243
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,076
- Norah.
- Yeah.

244
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:12,542
So, the cooling towers?
What are we getting?

245
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:14,942
Oh, um...

246
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,775
Nothing good.

247
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,408
All the upper decks
have collapsed

248
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:21,675
and we lost the cooling towers.

249
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,709
The core of the Kepler
is completely unstable.

250
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:24,942
Wait, what do you
mean "unstable"?

251
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,408
Like, poof,
we all die "unstable"?

252
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,375
What are we
talking about here, Norah?

253
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,209
The thermal cores.

254
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,042
That's a lot of energy
with nowhere to go.

255
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,842
Okay, the intern's
freaking me out.

256
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,575
Can somebody just explain
what the hell's going on here?

257
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:35,909
Research assistant.

258
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,609
No, there-there... There's a...
There's a, um...

259
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:38,842
If there's a meltdown,
there's gonna be a lot of heat.

260
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,609
There's gonna be
a flash boil, explosions.

261
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,709
I don't really know. I watch a
lot of anime. That's all I know.

262
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,276
Oh, you watch anime?
I like anime.

263
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:48,642
No, I mean, he's right.

264
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,775
We have about 30 minutes
till meltdown.

265
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:53,709
And, uh, it's gonna blow us
into tiny pieces to the surface.

266
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,942
And people are gonna find us,
like, floating around.

267
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:58,343
<i>Bulkhead compromised.</i>

268
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:00,076
Okay, guys, listen.

269
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:03,243
The escape pods are gone
and the sub is out of order.

270
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:05,609
And we're not getting
any more radio signals.

271
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,709
And the structure of the Kepler
is totally unsound.

272
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:09,508
Captain, there better be
a good punchline,

273
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:10,575
'cause this setup is...

274
00:21:10,575 --> 00:21:11,942
- So weak.
- weak.

275
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,243
We go for the Roebuck.

276
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,076
The Roebuck?

277
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,775
It's a mile down
and a mile that way.

278
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:21,343
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:22,842
How would we even get there?

280
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,176
We walk.

281
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,243
We what?

282
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,276
Walk.

283
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:29,876
We walk?

284
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:32,009
That's what you dug me
out of the rubble for?

285
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,076
I can't walk.

286
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:34,209
I don't even have a suit.

287
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,343
Listen, listen. Listen to me.

288
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:39,009
Here's what we're gonna do.

289
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:42,109
We're gonna drop down to the
cargo elevator to the seafloor.

290
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:45,876
Then we use the access tunnel
to get to the Midpoint station.

291
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:48,842
There we can charge
and clean the rebreathers.

292
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:51,009
And then we follow the markers

293
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,942
across the plateau
to the Roebuck.

294
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:58,309
So we just go in the pitch black

295
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,109
and we walk without knowing
where we're going

296
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:01,375
with insufficient oxygen?

297
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,842
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

298
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:04,375
Everybody down with that?
Norah, you okay with that?

299
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,609
The suits can't be down there
that long. You know that.

300
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:09,109
Not everyone here
is an experienced diver and...

301
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:10,209
Than we never know.

302
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:11,675
I'm-I'm not trying to be...

303
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,909
Can you just admit
we might die doing that?

304
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:18,408
Yeah. But can you admit
that we might live doing this?

305
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:21,042
Hey, what about
the old Shepard Station?

306
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,343
Isn't that closer?

307
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,142
Shepard Station's gone.
There's nothing there.

308
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:28,109
Uh, you guys,
you need to hear this.

309
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:31,976
Can this be
something good?

310
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,942
Could we please have
one good thing? Could we?

311
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:36,475
I think this was the last
transmission from the drill site.

312
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,542
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>

313
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,009
<i>We've been compromised by category ten...</i>

314
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,909
Now, what the hell
was that noise?

315
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,642
Also, the temperature outside
jumped ten degrees.

316
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,642
Great, so it'll be warm when
we're walking across the plateau.

317
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:07,575
The water doesn't do that.
That's impossible.

318
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:12,842
That's just aftershocks
from the last earthquake, okay?

319
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:14,709
It's 'cause
we drilled too deep. Okay?

320
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,609
It's those tectonic plates
I talk about all the time.

321
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:19,408
This is insane.
Okay, this is insane.

322
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,842
We go for the Roebuck.

323
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:33,042
What? If we're gonna
do this, let's do it!

324
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:33,976
Am I right?

325
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:38,375
All right, we can compromise.
I can turn it down.

326
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,176
Emily.

327
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,076
Lose your pants.
They won't fit in the suit.

328
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,742
<i>Deck A compromised.</i>

329
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,109
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

330
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:53,642
<i>Flooding contained.</i>

331
00:24:07,675 --> 00:24:09,675
Has anyone ever
walked out there before?

332
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,876
Longer than to fix a pipe.
I mean, just...

333
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:16,575
Just walked?

334
00:24:17,876 --> 00:24:18,709
No.

335
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:22,408
Check if we have enough helmets.

336
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:24,408
I just need you to find
six good ones.

337
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:30,842
Hey, Norah.

338
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:32,942
Hey.

339
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:34,542
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

340
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,609
Hey. How you doing?

341
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,442
You ready?

342
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:41,542
All right.

343
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:52,675
These are ripped too? Come on!

344
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:03,575
All right, this is gonna suck.

345
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,742
Okay.

346
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,542
Oh, sorry, sorry!

347
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:09,909
Okay. Good?

348
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,876
Go suit up.

349
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,575
Your air is good.

350
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,209
Thank you.

351
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:31,408
Okay, clear
all this shit from the deck.

352
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,709
What are you thinking?

353
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,675
I'm thinking
I really didn't like

354
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,109
the sound on that transmission.

355
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,142
We should take something.

356
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:51,775
Yeah.

357
00:25:52,575 --> 00:25:54,642
That's a very valid point.

358
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:57,475
Okay. Let me see your back.

359
00:25:57,475 --> 00:25:58,976
Okay. Last checks.

360
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:01,742
Let's go.

361
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,309
All right, listen up.

362
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,909
We watch our descent rate
and follow all safety protocols.

363
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:12,442
Remember,
these suits are dangerous.

364
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,475
Hey, what's so funny?

365
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:24,209
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

366
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,675
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

367
00:26:26,675 --> 00:26:29,442
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just an elevator, all right?

368
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:31,243
It's all lit up
to the weigh station.

369
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:32,243
You just follow the pipeline.

370
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:35,009
You can do it. Come on, come on.

371
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:37,009
Hey, what's the scariest
part of a roller coaster?

372
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:39,809
Waiting in line.

373
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:42,109
Ready?

374
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:46,243
I'm gonna be right there
with you. Every step.

375
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:48,209
<i>Main bridge compromised.</i>

376
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,375
We have to move.

377
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,442
All right.
Everybody in the pool.

378
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:53,742
Okay, we gotta go.

379
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,775
That was one level above us.

380
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,575
This one's next. Let's go.

381
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,375
<i>integrity compromised.</i>

382
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:04,209
<i>Structural integrity

383
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,142
<i>Take us down.</i>

384
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:06,876
<i>"If you don't know
where you're going,</i>

385
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,176
<i>any road can get

386
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:10,343
<i>Dude.</i>

387
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:11,976
<i>What? It's not me, Norah.
It's from a book.</i>

388
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:12,942
<i>Let's go.</i>

389
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:15,709
<i>We all know you
can't read.</i>

390
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,709
All right,
I don't wanna scare anyone,

391
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,076
<i>but once we get
to the depth</i>

392
00:27:47,076 --> 00:27:49,042
<i>we're gonna have to
jump to the cargo lift.</i>

393
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,809
<i>Okay, here we go.
Shit.</i>

394
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,408
Exterior hatch,
it's ripped to shreds.

395
00:27:58,408 --> 00:27:59,508
<i>Everybody, get ready.</i>

396
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:00,642
<i>Hang onto
something 'cause</i>

397
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,642
<i>pressure's gonna
hit us hard.</i>

398
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:03,742
<i>Override it.</i>

399
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,375
<i>As long as it opens,
we'll be fine.</i>

400
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:09,408
Captain, I don't know
what's going on with this thing.

401
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:10,309
<i>Well,
keep trying.</i>

402
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,343
<i>Rodrigo.</i>

403
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:15,642
<i>Guys, what's going on?</i>

404
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,508
<i>Keep the door closed.
Keep the door closed!</i>

405
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,976
Stay where you are.
Close your eyes.

406
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:36,109
It's okay, Em.
You're good, you're good.

407
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,243
<i>Listen. Listen.</i>

408
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,142
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

409
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:21,775
Let's go, Emily.
Step to the edge.

410
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:22,976
<i>You have to jump now.</i>

411
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,408
<i>Norah, he's gone.</i>

412
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,475
<i>It's your turn.
You need to jump.</i>

413
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,842
He knew that
that helmet was faulty.

414
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,442
I mean, I-I-I know
that he knew it.

415
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,109
Listen.

416
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,742
I know how you feel.
I know it's unfair.

417
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,309
But you're gonna have to
take it and use it.

418
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,976
Yeah. Okay.

419
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:05,042
Come on.

420
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:05,842
The sooner we get clear

421
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:06,976
of the station the better.

422
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,408
I've never seen
anyone die before.

423
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:40,508
I saw somebody die.

424
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:44,742
I've never seen anybody implode.

425
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,976
What are you laughing at?

426
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:55,343
Uh, I was just
thinking of this thing

427
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:57,442
that Rodrigo did sometimes.

428
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:58,775
He'd always say
he had a new joke,

429
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:00,742
and then he'd tell
the same stupid joke.

430
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:04,076
I was... laughing at that joke.

431
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:06,976
Yeah, what was it?

432
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,942
What did the fish say when
it bumped into the brick wall?

433
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:14,442
"Dam."

434
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:18,076
Pretty stupid joke.

435
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,408
It looks like
whatever it is

436
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,009
might be on the deck below us.

437
00:31:45,076 --> 00:31:48,309
I think it's a distress signal
from one of the pods.

438
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,542
How far?

439
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,142
Two hundred more meters.

440
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:54,442
Why wouldn't it be
going to the surface?

441
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:55,842
Maybe it's only got
half a charge.

442
00:31:57,142 --> 00:31:58,609
Uh...

443
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:00,408
It's definitely stopped
on the platform below us.

444
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:02,009
Survivor.

445
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:04,076
It could be a survivor.

446
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:08,775
Guys, somebody's gonna
have to suit up.

447
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:10,742
All right, Emily,
this is your time.

448
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:11,709
What?

449
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:13,709
I'm just messing with you.

450
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:17,675
Here, take him.

451
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,009
Take this bunny.

452
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,042
I bequeath it to you.

453
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,276
If he doesn't make it,
I'll haunt you.

454
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,709
Let's go, guys.

455
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,976
We don't know how long
until the Kepler blows.

456
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,909
Let's go put
our lives in danger.

457
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,742
- Be careful.
- We'll be right back.

458
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:38,276
Paul's crazy. Right?

459
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:41,309
Yeah. I guess so.

460
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,508
<i>Hey,
Captain, what do we do?</i>

461
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,109
With the body, when we find it.

462
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:47,243
We're talking about
a possible survivor, Paul.

463
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:48,442
<i>Okay.</i>

464
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:50,176
<i>Then hypothetically.</i>

465
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,909
<i>Let's say we were to come
across a body and it was dead.</i>

466
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,042
Just grab something
we can take back to his family.

467
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,609
<i>It's okay. I
know what to do.</i>

468
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,809
Oh, really?
We got G.I. Joe over here.

469
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,442
And we are about to touch...

470
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:09,309
in three, two, one.

471
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:14,142
We're locked in.

472
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,142
<i>All right.</i>

473
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:16,142
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yeah.

474
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,642
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

475
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:21,309
Let's get this done
before the Kepler

476
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:22,542
<i>comes down on our asses.</i>

477
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,076
Okay.

478
00:33:24,076 --> 00:33:27,876
Turn on all the camera feeds
we have available.

479
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:30,042
How long can
someone survive in a pod?

480
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,942
If he lost power, not long.

481
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:34,809
Especially at this depth.

482
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:39,109
Okay, guys, we're starting
the decompression now.

483
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,408
Are either of you two married?

484
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,542
Was.

485
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,542
Kids?

486
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:48,309
Daughter.

487
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,375
How-how old is she?

488
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,976
Fourteen.

489
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:52,642
That's a tough age for a girl.

490
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:54,976
I mean, it's-it's a phase.
It will pass.

491
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:57,176
She's not 14.

492
00:33:57,176 --> 00:33:59,442
Allie? She's gotta be
like my age, right?

493
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:01,408
Who said 14? Did I say that?

494
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,442
Yeah.

495
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,442
Well, I don't know
why I said it.

496
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:06,642
You're losing it, old man.

497
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:08,176
You're going senile down here.

498
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:11,775
It's actually a normal
neurological reaction.

499
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:12,876
When you're facing death,
time just...

500
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,009
Listen to me. Listen to me.

501
00:34:15,842 --> 00:34:18,076
You're not gonna die. Okay?

502
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:22,542
<i>All right.</i>

503
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,176
<i>Worst idea ever.</i>

504
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,575
<i>Let's do it anyway.</i>

505
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,375
<i>Helmets on.
Locked and loaded.</i>

506
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,642
Either of you have dogs?

507
00:34:30,642 --> 00:34:31,742
<i>Flood it, Norah!</i>

508
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:33,742
Flooding.

509
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,842
I have a corgi.

510
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,976
Not house-trained, so he's
kind of a nightmare right now,

511
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,809
but I didn't think
I would miss him this much.

512
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,742
Okay, hatch is sealed.
We're outside.

513
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,009
Okay, I'll put us on standby.

514
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:53,442
Turn the floodlights on, please.

515
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:06,876
Cap, this platform's
not too stable.

516
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:09,042
<i>I, uh, don't know how long
we should be out here.</i>

517
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,709
<i>Oh, God.</i>

518
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:31,076
Guys, keep on walking forward.

519
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:32,309
Like 20 meters.

520
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:33,709
<i>Check what's
on the right.</i>

521
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:40,109
<i>I can't see shit.
My right or his right?</i>

522
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,542
<i>What the
hell is that?</i>

523
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,408
<i>Am I cracking up
or is there, like,</i>

524
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:54,042
<i>like, a bird
chirping right now?</i>

525
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,375
We're not hearing
anything up here.

526
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:03,709
All right,
Captain, talk to us.

527
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,675
<i>We close? We can't see
anything out here.</i>

528
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,009
Honestly, you should be
right in front of it.

529
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:10,076
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,675
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

531
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:24,508
<i>Oh, hold up.</i>

532
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,742
<i>You see that?</i>

533
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:30,243
<i>Holy shit.</i>

534
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:31,809
<i>What the hell
happened to this thing?</i>

535
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:38,842
<i>Looks like it imploded.
There's, uh, something.</i>

536
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,575
<i>Something all over it.</i>

537
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:44,642
<i>You seeing this?</i>

538
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:48,508
What is that?

539
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:49,742
I would need to take
a closer look.

540
00:36:49,742 --> 00:36:51,775
It could be
some sort of an-an algae.

541
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,375
You ever see
anything like that?

542
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,542
<i>This looks...</i>

543
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:57,942
<i>It doesn't look
like algae.</i>

544
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:01,508
Is there anybody in it?

545
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:02,475
<i>Empty.</i>

546
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:04,675
<i>I got something.</i>

547
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,508
<i>Wallet.</i>

548
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:12,076
<i>Great. We can use
his credit cards.</i>

549
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:17,642
<i>All right, Captain,
there's no body,</i>

550
00:37:17,642 --> 00:37:19,042
<i>so can we please
and thank you</i>

551
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,842
<i>get the hell out of here
before we...</i>

552
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:25,243
<i>Scratch that. There's a body.
It's entangled...</i>

553
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,475
They should just come back.

554
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:27,742
<i>in the coils.</i>

555
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:36,976
Dude, don't check it out.
Just come back.

556
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:38,408
- Just come back.
- <i>Wait.</i>

557
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:39,642
<i>Do you see his back?</i>

558
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:47,375
- <i>Can you guys see that?</i>
- Let's just bring them back.

559
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,475
Okay, come back, guys.

560
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,475
<i>Paul.</i>

561
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:52,475
<i>Whoa. Smith.</i>

562
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:55,042
Paul.

563
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:00,842
The hell's going on
with his body?

564
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:07,343
<i>Did the pressure...
liquefy...</i>

565
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,542
<i>Paul, hold
still! God!</i>

566
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:18,675
What is that thing?

567
00:38:18,675 --> 00:38:20,508
All I know is that it was
eating a dead body

568
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,976
and then it came at me.

569
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:28,176
Em, what are you doing?

570
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:29,876
Uh, I'm just looking for its...

571
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,542
Oh, no, no!

572
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,209
See?

573
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,642
Looking for its mouth.

574
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:39,742
Is it still alive?

575
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:41,609
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause I will kill it.

576
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,209
I think I just touched a nerve.

577
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:46,243
Norah, how much
further do we have?

578
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,109
Two hundred meters
away from the bottom.

579
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,508
It doesn't have any eyes.

580
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:52,442
How are they attracted
to the light?

581
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:53,709
Oh, my God, look at this.

582
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,542
Maybe they're like moths.

583
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,542
Underwater moths.

584
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,642
It's like talons.

585
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:01,609
I think this might be
a new species.

586
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,243
Do we get to name it?

587
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:04,809
I shot it. I'm naming it.

588
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:09,876
I've never seen
sea life like this down here.

589
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,009
Unless... Unless we bored
into a hydrothermal pocket.

590
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:20,842
If it was sustained heat
that could support life...

591
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:22,942
Are you serious?

592
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:26,042
Everybody stay calm. Stay calm.

593
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,009
- Oh, my God.
- Norah, what'd you get?

594
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,442
Nothing.
It's not just the lights.

595
00:39:29,442 --> 00:39:31,243
The whole system's down.

596
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,042
Can you put us in neutral?
Glide the rest of the way?

597
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:33,876
Yeah.

598
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,742
We have access to the cable?

599
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:42,109
If we can disengage, definitely.

600
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:46,942
What was that?

601
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,375
This better not be some

602
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,809
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea</i> shit, man.

603
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:31,709
- Paul.
- What the hell?

604
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,609
I'm just joking.

605
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:33,609
But it does sound like

606
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:34,775
there's something out there.

607
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:44,876
It's probably not a good time
to ask, but is that a baby?

608
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:57,876
Should we close that door?

609
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:07,109
I'm gonna close it.
I'm gonna close that door.

610
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:28,842
Okay.

611
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:33,309
We gotta find a way to get down.

612
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,642
We're completely disengaged.
I don't know why we're not moving yet.

613
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,508
Oh, my God!

614
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,642
What the hell was that?

615
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,609
- Oh, my God!
- The Kepler exploded!

616
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:57,609
The Kepler!

617
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:59,375
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

618
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:02,775
Captain!

619
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:05,408
Into the pressure chamber!

620
00:42:05,408 --> 00:42:06,442
Oh, God!

621
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,675
We have to open
the outside hatch

622
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:13,209
before we hit the seafloor!

623
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,076
Or we get crushed! Move!

624
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,508
Flood it! Flood it!

625
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,375
Helmet, now!
Here we go! Come on!

626
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:28,343
<i>Help!</i>

627
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:29,709
<i>Hang on!</i>

628
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,508
Here we go.
Open the hatch!

629
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:32,442
<i>All right.</i>

630
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,475
<i>Run! Run! Run!</i>

631
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,909
<i>Watch it! Watch it!</i>

632
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,442
<i>Norah.</i>

633
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:02,442
<i>Hey, guys!
I'm over here.</i>

634
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:04,775
<i>Come to the green light.
I'm at the entrance.</i>

635
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:07,542
<i>Watch out, Smith!</i>

636
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,642
<i>Emily, watch
out!</i>

637
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:12,042
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

638
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:12,909
<i>Keep 'em closed.</i>

639
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:14,009
<i>I don't know
what happened.</i>

640
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:17,942
<i>Come on, take him.</i>

641
00:43:17,942 --> 00:43:19,508
<i>To the pipeline entrance!</i>

642
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:20,642
<i>Come on.</i>

643
00:43:26,842 --> 00:43:29,775
I can't get
the goddamn door open!

644
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,176
<i>Smith, can you hear me?</i>

645
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:34,009
<i>It's gonna be okay, buddy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

646
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:52,142
<i>Come on.</i>

647
00:43:52,142 --> 00:43:53,809
<i>Let's get him clear
of the door!</i>

648
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,042
<i>Get him up. Get him up.</i>

649
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,209
Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

650
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:02,775
What happened? Are you okay?

651
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:04,209
He inhaled some fumes.
He's okay.

652
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,109
His oxygen scrubber took a hit.

653
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:09,009
We all saw this, right?
There are things out there.

654
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,675
Fuck our lives!

655
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:21,309
See?
There's something out there.

656
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:22,742
Oh, my God.

657
00:44:22,742 --> 00:44:25,709
Paul, stop.
It's just debris falling.

658
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,542
Norah, call the mover.

659
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:28,942
All right.

660
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:32,976
Look at me.

661
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:34,042
How's your sight?

662
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,042
I'm good.

663
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:41,042
- It's gonna be all right, man.
- Okay.

664
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,976
I don't have the code.
I-I can't get in here.

665
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:49,976
Ears.

666
00:44:51,243 --> 00:44:52,076
Eh, forget it.

667
00:44:57,508 --> 00:44:59,642
- Give me your hand.
- Two, three!

668
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,809
It's gonna be fine, buddy. Yeah.

669
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:17,408
All right. We ride this
to the Midpoint Station.

670
00:45:22,142 --> 00:45:23,408
We're halfway there, guys.

671
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,375
Halfway there.

672
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:57,508
Paul, stop the cart.

673
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:58,775
It's not gonna go
in that kind of water.

674
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:00,508
Stop it.

675
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:07,109
That's a lot of water.

676
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:08,642
The pumps are probably jammed.

677
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,842
What happens
if they don't turn back on?

678
00:46:10,842 --> 00:46:13,475
Anybody else wanna take that?

679
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,609
No?

680
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,742
In the book, Alice cried so much

681
00:46:16,742 --> 00:46:19,243
she almost drowned
in her own tears.

682
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,442
Luckily, she could swim.

683
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:23,176
It got pretty rough
for her after that.

684
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,809
There's definitely
something following us.

685
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,633
Okay. I'm getting very close
to shitting myself.

686
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:27,234
Looks like somebody got
a care package.

687
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:28,834
Cheetos and...

688
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:31,034
Oh, the irony.

689
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,001
I love MoonPies.

690
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,867
This is someone's stuff.

691
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,067
This is all someone's...

692
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:49,934
Oh...

693
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,667
Oh...

694
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:53,767
Oh, my God.

695
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,600
Keep moving. Keep moving.

696
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:18,067
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:20,401
Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

698
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:21,800
It should be 300 meters ahead.

699
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,234
Is this it?

700
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:40,667
We can't go back.

701
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,800
What does that mean?

702
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,767
It's too tight.

703
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,034
Oh, no.

704
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:47,767
We've got to find
another way.

705
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:49,533
I'm the smallest. Let me check.

706
00:48:50,434 --> 00:48:51,267
Here.

707
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,301
Okay.

708
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,800
Let me connect you with my line.

709
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:57,934
Attached.

710
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:02,800
Thank you.

711
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:34,267
All right, I'm through.
It's open out here.

712
00:49:34,267 --> 00:49:35,867
And I think you guys
can definitely make it.

713
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:37,234
It's really tight but...

714
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:38,800
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Huh?

715
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,700
<i>We're sending Emily.</i>

716
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,734
Yeah, okay.

717
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,633
Attached.

718
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:55,600
<i>Captain's
on his way.</i>

719
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,633
Hey, come here.

720
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:00,167
Nice.

721
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:08,434
Hey.

722
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:10,001
How you holding up?

723
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:10,834
I'm okay.

724
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,234
Um, I was gonna eat this,

725
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,201
but Lil Paul and I decided

726
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:17,900
that you should
give it to your girl.

727
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,201
- MoonPie.
- Yeah.

728
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:22,201
MoonPie.

729
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:25,101
Thanks, man.

730
00:50:25,101 --> 00:50:27,034
She's pretty cool.

731
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:29,101
Gotta make sure
not to screw that up.

732
00:50:31,201 --> 00:50:32,034
Yeah.

733
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,334
Smith.

734
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:41,567
<i>Your turn. Come on.</i>

735
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:43,600
All right, Cap's through.
I'm going.

736
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,101
<i>All right, guys.
I'm coming through.</i>

737
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,900
How are you doing in there, buddy?

738
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,267
You want your bunny heater?

739
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,700
All right, forget this.
We're going in.

740
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:14,500
Hey. You okay?

741
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,700
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

742
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:17,900
- You okay?
- Yeah.

743
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:21,500
- <i>What is that?</i>
- Huh?

744
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,067
Paul?
Paul, are you reading?

745
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,867
Don't screw around. Let's go.

746
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:26,667
Hey, Paul, you copy?

747
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,533
We're gonna pull you through.

748
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:29,967
- All right, pull.
- All right.

749
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:30,800
Here we go.

750
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:42,633
- Come on.
- I'm pulling. I'm pulling.

751
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:44,567
Come on.

752
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,667
Shit!

753
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,167
Come on, come on.

754
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,167
There he is.

755
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:56,134
You scared the shit out of me.

756
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:58,734
There's something back there.
Some Slender Man-type shit.

757
00:51:58,734 --> 00:51:59,834
Hey, that's not funny.

758
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,067
What's wrong with my line?

759
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,934
Smith, unclip.
He's all tangled up.

760
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:08,900
- Okay, I got it.
- Oh, no!

761
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:12,167
Unclip, unclip, unclip!

762
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:14,667
Take Lil Paul! Take Lil Paul!

763
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:15,767
Give me my helmet!

764
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,567
It's pulling me underwater!

765
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,800
He's going! Helmet!

766
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,600
- My helmet!
- Helmet, now!

767
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,867
Get it on! Get it on!

768
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,834
Grab him! Grab him!

769
00:52:31,267 --> 00:52:32,533
Grab him! Grab him!

770
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:38,600
I can't hold him!

771
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:44,201
Oh, my God!

772
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:46,600
Oh, my God!

773
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:48,533
Paul!

774
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,234
Get out of the water!

775
00:52:54,234 --> 00:52:55,800
- Emily, go!
- Get to the bulkhead!

776
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,134
<i>Calling CQ. Calling CQ.
This is Captain Lucien.</i>

777
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:19,167
<i>We're at the Midway Station.
It's heavily damaged.</i>

778
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:22,967
Not sure how long it will last.

779
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:26,600
Does anyone copy?

780
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,001
It ripped him out of the suit.

781
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,734
It ripped him right out
of his goddamn suit.

782
00:53:35,234 --> 00:53:36,234
What could do that?

783
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:37,734
<i>Begin evacuation</i>

784
00:53:37,734 --> 00:53:39,301
<i>to surface immediately.</i>

785
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:40,667
CQ, do you copy?

786
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:44,500
<i>Overwatch
tower is online.</i>

787
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:46,600
What is happening?

788
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,001
That drill weighs 6,000 tons.

789
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,800
How did it get
ripped up like that?

790
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,500
We did this.

791
00:54:04,434 --> 00:54:06,201
We drilled
the bottom of the ocean.

792
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:09,134
We took too much.

793
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:12,500
And now she's taking back.

794
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:19,600
We're not supposed to be
down here.

795
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:23,201
No one is.

796
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:27,267
She's not wrong.

797
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:41,101
Listen.

798
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,600
I know Paul's gone, but...

799
00:54:45,734 --> 00:54:47,101
we can't stay here.

800
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,567
What about Smith's suit?

801
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,533
Let me take a look
at your oxygen scrubber.

802
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:54,900
- Hmm.
- Come on.

803
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,867
How is it?

804
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:10,567
The suit's not gonna make it.

805
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,734
You guys gotta
go without me. We... I'm...

806
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,834
I'm just gonna be
dead weight out there.

807
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:28,934
- I can't lose anybody else.
- Me neither.

808
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:31,234
Stop.

809
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:40,067
Okay,
Smith, you can lean on me.

810
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:43,567
<i>Take short,
shallow breaths.</i>

811
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:45,600
<i>Okay.</i>

812
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,834
<i>It's gonna be all right.
I got you.</i>

813
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,201
<i>Okay, there's Marker 21.</i>

814
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:35,967
<i>All we do now is follow
these across the plateau.</i>

815
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:38,067
<i>The Roebuck Station
will be at Marker Zero.</i>

816
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:06,633
<i>What did you see? Huh?</i>

817
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:13,201
<i>I don't know.</i>

818
00:57:24,934 --> 00:57:25,934
- I just saw it.
- Oh, my God!

819
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:27,101
<i>I saw that.</i>

820
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:27,834
<i>Set him down.</i>

821
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:29,401
<i>What was that?</i>

822
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:30,600
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

823
00:57:32,101 --> 00:57:33,767
<i>Where is it? Where is it?</i>

824
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,667
<i>Turn off the lights.</i>

825
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:43,600
<i>Don't move.</i>

826
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,101
<i>I'm gonna turn my IR on.</i>

827
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:56,633
<i>Norah, did you
get my feed?</i>

828
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:58,267
Yeah.

829
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:18,401
<i>Smith?</i>

830
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:20,001
<i>Where's Smith? Norah?</i>

831
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:23,101
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- Do you see him?

832
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:24,267
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

833
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,767
- <i>Smith!</i>
- <i>Emily.</i>

834
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:27,267
- <i>Smith?</i>
- Smith!

835
00:58:27,267 --> 00:58:29,167
<i>Emily. Help.</i>

836
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:34,633
- <i>That's his foot.</i>
- I'm going.

837
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:37,633
<i>I'm hooking
onto you. Here.</i>

838
00:58:47,533 --> 00:58:48,567
<i>I see him.</i>

839
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:00,034
<i>I got him.</i>

840
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:03,934
<i>He's alive. He's alive.</i>

841
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:06,600
<i>I'm pulling him back.</i>

842
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,167
<i>Okay.</i>

843
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,800
<i>Just push him.
We'll grab his feet.</i>

844
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,334
<i>Smith, can you hear us?</i>

845
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:16,900
Smith, please! Can you hear us?

846
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,267
<i>I gotta grab the gun.</i>

847
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,034
<i>What?
Forget the gun.</i>

848
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:22,767
<i>Captain, leave it.</i>

849
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:28,201
Cap.

850
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:36,234
<i>Cap, what are you doing?</i>

851
00:59:36,234 --> 00:59:38,334
- <i>Norah!</i>
- No!

852
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:41,101
<i>No!</i>

853
00:59:41,101 --> 00:59:42,101
<i>No!</i>

854
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,167
<i>Norah?</i>

855
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,067
<i>You okay?</i>

856
01:00:01,134 --> 01:00:03,134
<i>I can't see you.
Can you see me?</i>

857
01:00:05,734 --> 01:00:06,834
<i>Norah?</i>

858
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:11,067
<i>Where are you?</i>

859
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:13,734
I'm underneath you.
Can you see me?

860
01:00:13,734 --> 01:00:16,201
<i>Cap, can
you hear me?</i>

861
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:17,034
<i>Norah.</i>

862
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:18,800
<i>Where are you?</i>

863
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,667
<i>I'm here.
Underneath.</i>

864
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,867
<i>I'm all tangled.
Can you see me?</i>

865
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:27,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

866
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:29,734
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

867
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,533
<i>Where is it?</i>

868
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,067
<i>I don't know.</i>

869
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,034
<i>Get me
out of here.</i>

870
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,167
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Shit.

871
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,700
<i>Okay, let me see
if I can help you. Hold on.</i>

872
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,468
<i>Can you reach my knife?</i>

873
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:58,001
<i>What was that?</i>

874
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,500
<i>Norah.</i>

875
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:12,500
<i>Is it back?</i>

876
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,900
<i>What do you see?</i>

877
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:17,201
<i>Is it back?</i>

878
01:01:30,334 --> 01:01:31,201
<i>Norah!</i>

879
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:41,767
<i>Norah!</i>

880
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,500
<i>Oh, I got you. I got you.
I'm with you.</i>

881
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,234
<i>I'm with you.</i>

882
01:01:57,234 --> 01:01:59,067
<i>Pressure level critical.</i>

883
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:00,001
<i>We're
rising too fast!</i>

884
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,700
<i>The pressure's gonna
kill us both!</i>

885
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,800
<i>Please slow ascent.</i>

886
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:08,001
<i>Norah.</i>

887
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:13,301
<i>Let go.</i>

888
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:15,201
<i>Suit

<i>Norah,
look at me.</i>

890
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,533
<i>Let go, God damn it!</i>

891
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:21,767
No, I can't. I can't. I can't.

892
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:22,734
<i>Four percent.</i>

893
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:25,767

<i>No, no, no. No, no, no.</i>

01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:27,934
<i>Two percent.</i>

896
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:29,201
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

897
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,001
<i>No, don't do that.</i>

898
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,567
<i>One percent.</i>

899
01:02:32,567 --> 01:02:33,533
<i>Don't do that!
Don't do that!</i>

900
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,734
<i>Emily, can
you hear me?</i>

901
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,134
<i>Emily, Smith,
can you hear me?</i>

902
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,900
<i>I'm still alive. I'm at
the old Shepard drill.</i>

903
01:05:09,734 --> 01:05:11,167
<i>There's no...</i>

904
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,700
<i>There's no pods here
but I can breathe.</i>

905
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,934
<i>I have some air.</i>

906
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:16,067
<i>If you guys are
out there...</i>

907
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,967
<i>Is anyone reading?</i>

908
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:26,201
Emily, can you hear me?

909
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,001
Can you guys hear me?

910
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:05,533
Cap.

911
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:31,167
Allie.

912
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:40,067
I'm sorry.

913
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:28,667
<i>Guys, I'm just gonna
keep talking.</i>

914
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:29,934
<i>I don't know if
you can hear me.</i>

915
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,001
<i>I'm following
the southeast line.</i>

916
01:08:40,234 --> 01:08:41,567
<i>Following the markers.</i>

917
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:43,567
<i>To the Roebuck.</i>

918
01:08:46,368 --> 01:08:48,101
<i>I used to love the ocean.</i>

919
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:57,967
<i>It was like a giant
petri dish, you know?</i>

920
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,134
<i>Em, is that you?</i>

921
01:09:13,867 --> 01:09:16,334
<i>I know that you have...</i>

922
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:19,867
<i>a different Hawaiian shirt
for every day of the week.</i>

923
01:09:19,867 --> 01:09:21,867
Emily, I can hear you.
Is that you?

924
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:23,633
<i>Though I...</i>

925
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:25,900
<i>Even though
I don't know you</i>

926
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,734
<i>outside of this
petri dish...</i>

927
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:28,900
<i>Emily.</i>

928
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,900
But I know
that you listen to me.

929
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,967
<i>And you make me laugh.</i>

930
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:47,734
<i>I love you.</i>

931
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,401
<i>You know?</i>

932
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:51,500
<i>Em?</i>

933
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,067
<i>Emily?</i>

934
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,700
<i>I needed you to know.</i>

935
01:09:57,468 --> 01:09:58,267
<i>Emily?</i>

936
01:10:00,101 --> 01:10:01,468
<i>Hey.</i>

937
01:10:01,468 --> 01:10:03,468
<i>Emily, I'm right
behind you.</i>

938
01:10:03,468 --> 01:10:04,767
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

939
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,734
<i>Hey, Emily.</i>

940
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:13,167
- <i>Emily!</i>
- No! Please!

941
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,700
<i>Please stay back!</i>

942
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,334
<i>Emily, stop!</i>

943
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:23,934
<i>Emily. Hey, hey.</i>

944
01:10:23,934 --> 01:10:26,567
<i>Hey. Em? Em? Em?
Open your eyes.</i>

945
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:27,867
<i>Emily, open your eyes.
It's me.</i>

946
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:29,368
<i>Hey, I got you.</i>

947
01:10:29,368 --> 01:10:30,600
- <i>I got you.</i>
- Norah, I thought you...

948
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,967
- You're okay.
- Norah...

949
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:35,867
<i>Norah, I thought you...
I thought you were dead.</i>

950
01:10:35,867 --> 01:10:37,134
<i>How's Smith? Is he okay?</i>

951
01:10:37,134 --> 01:10:38,334
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

952
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,001
<i>He's here. He's alive.</i>

953
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:42,234
<i>Okay. That's what
matters, right?</i>

954
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:43,034
<i>Yes.</i>

955
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:46,600
<i>Come on, let's get up.
Come here.</i>

956
01:10:57,034 --> 01:11:00,867
<i>I didn't get very far.</i>

957
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:02,867
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

958
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:05,034
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

959
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:06,900
<i>I-I can't even
believe it, honestly.</i>

960
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,368
<i>Your air must be...</i>

961
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:10,567
<i>Let me check your air,
though. You must be so...</i>

962
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,067
<i>No, I'm just...</i>

963
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:12,934
<i>I figured...</i>

964
01:11:14,434 --> 01:11:15,867
<i>I'm just gonna walk.</i>

965
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:18,533
<i>Okay. That's a good plan.</i>

966
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
<i>The captain?</i>

967
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,034
<i>Just grab Smith. Okay?</i>

968
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:32,967
<i>Don't think about
it. Come on.</i>

969
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,734
<i>God, I feel high.</i>

970
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:41,234
<i>Freebie.</i>

971
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:44,800
<i>It's the low
oxygen thing.</i>

972
01:11:46,234 --> 01:11:47,700
<i>I can't
feel my fingers.</i>

973
01:11:51,468 --> 01:11:52,700
<i>What's your dog's name?</i>

974
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,533
<i>Tenny. Yours?</i>

975
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:57,134
<i>That's cute. Jim.</i>

976
01:11:57,134 --> 01:11:58,468
<i>Jim?</i>

977
01:11:58,468 --> 01:11:59,767
<i>James if he gets
in trouble.</i>

978
01:12:03,034 --> 01:12:04,734
<i>He was my fiancé's dog,
actually.</i>

979
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,234
<i>You guys split up?</i>

980
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:10,034
<i>No.</i>

981
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,533
<i>No way. He, um...</i>

982
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:16,767
<i>He was Smith's
best friend, actually.</i>

983
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,533
<i>We used to all
dive together.</i>

984
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:24,134
<i>He wanted to go
out one night.</i>

985
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:25,867
<i>I was tired.
I let him go alone, and...</i>

986
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:29,967
<i>he just took forever.</i>

987
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:31,101
<i>I knew something
was wrong. So I...</i>

988
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:35,567
<i>I called Search and Rescue
and went down to look for him.</i>

989
01:12:35,567 --> 01:12:38,867
<i>I just... couldn't
find him.</i>

990
01:12:41,234 --> 01:12:43,567
<i>I'm sorry. You don't
need to hear that right now.</i>

991
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,368
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

992
01:12:46,368 --> 01:12:50,633
<i>It's just that feeling of
beingpowerless to change anything.</i>

993
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:55,734
<i>It almost killed me.</i>

994
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:01,700
<i>I made Smith swear to me</i>

995
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,667
<i>he would never talk
about it down here.</i>

996
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:10,633
<i>You really love him, huh?</i>

997
01:13:13,468 --> 01:13:14,234
<i>Yeah.</i>

998
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:17,267
<i>That's really cool.</i>

999
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:23,600
<i>You just gotta
keep pulling.</i>

1000
01:13:55,767 --> 01:13:56,900
<i>What is that?</i>

1001
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,001
<i>What is that glow?</i>

1002
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:03,867
<i>It's the drill.</i>

1003
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:05,001
<i>It's the Roebuck.</i>

1004
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,067
<i>Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we made it.</i>

1005
01:14:46,368 --> 01:14:48,267
Come on. Come on.

1006
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:50,500
Fuck.

1007
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,034
<i>We're almost there.</i>

1008
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:08,567
<i>Almost there.
Just to the green light.</i>

1009
01:15:18,934 --> 01:15:20,734
<i>What are they?</i>

1010
01:15:20,734 --> 01:15:22,401
<i>Turn your
lights off.</i>

1011
01:15:22,401 --> 01:15:23,633
Turn your lights off.

1012
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:31,101
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1013
01:15:40,767 --> 01:15:42,700
Where are they all coming from?

1014
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,567
<i>The door is right there.</i>

1015
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:54,834
<i>Right there.</i>

1016
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,434
They look like
they're sleeping.

1017
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:04,734
<i>Or hibernating.</i>

1018
01:16:09,234 --> 01:16:12,533

1024
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,101
