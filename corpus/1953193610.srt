1
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,020
They say,

2
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,150
when you hear the sounds of devils,

3
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,640
all else is quiet.

4
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,960
My general question to that is:

5
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,470
How do you know if what you are hearing

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,580
is the work of such devious beings?

7
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,390
I would venture to say that
most devilish noises occur,

8
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,720
when large numbers of men decide

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,560
to force the hand of mortality
upon one another.

10
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,830
And I'd say futher,

11
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,800
that on such occasions,

12
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,360
there is not just one sound,

13
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,790
but many.

14
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,410
It is a quiet orchestra of death.

15
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,520
It is also possible that the man
who wrote that saying

16
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,860
might've just had some broken ears.

17
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,860
I have been moved from one wipe out
regimen to the next.

18
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,830
Witnessing countless moral felonies.

19
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,610
I met General McClain in
the last summer of the war,

20
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,680
peculiar man.

21
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,430
Captain Lee Briggs.

22
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,640
Sir?

23
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,240
Man of nine lives.

24
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,830
Have you any idea of how
many divisions have us pinned here?

25
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,210
No sir.

26
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,950
Let's just say,
enough to make fate unfavorable.

27
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,630
I've got a job for you Briggs.

28
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,540
It's recently come
to my attention that an object

29
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,480
of grandest design has been
discovered east of the Colorado basin.

30
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,890
Given the undeniable truth

31
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,530
that we here are on a collision
course with destiny.

32
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,460
Neither I nor my men will be able
to get witness to this object.

33
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,930
Someone ought to see it.

34
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,580
I reckon it should be you.

35
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,360
The sole survivor of the 22nd Connecticut.

36
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,430
Even one man alive is homage to the rest.

37
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,710
Make regular notes of your journey Briggs.

38
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,020
To be given a pass

39
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,920
to watch all others go,

40
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,810
is perhaps the most
troubling thing to one's being.

41
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
Sometimes when I wake up,

42
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,460
I feel like I'm still sleeping.

43
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,020
I feel like all the colours
and shapes of the world

44
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,310
have collided,

45
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,660
and all I can do
is just sit there and watch.

46
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,080
I think a person heart as a way
of turning off when it can't find reason.

47
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,030
I guess that's why nature
has always had an inspiring presence.

48
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,110
Everything follows a purpose.

49
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,070
I guess we're missing something.

50
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,070
Why do we struggle

51
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,780
to breathe a more righteous breath,

52
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,720
when we all end up in the same place?

53
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,210
I'd like to hope

54
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,690
that our history is worth remembering.

55
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,980
An imprint of careful design,

56
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,990
a feeling of heartfelt purpose.

57
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,180
And a sense of hope

58
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,000
for something bigger than ourself.

59
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,100
And,

60
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,830
maybe I'll wake up.

61
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,740
ISS module, 32 Delta, this is Cambridge,

62
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,980
do you have a fix on us, over.

63
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,830
Copy that, this is 32 Delta,
I've got you.

64
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,760
Alpha Bravo, we are linking a satcom.

65
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,970
Now, wait for transmissions to follow.

66
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,420
Copy that.

67
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,420
That is 89 43.23

68
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,530
followed by 32.35.12.67

69
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,880
follow it 21.01

70
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,530
ISS your satcom link is now active.

71
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,530
Houston you have line operation.

72
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,530
Roger that,
thank you Cambridge.

73
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,210
How are you up there?

74
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,190
I'm doing fine,
how are you?

75
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,770
We all doing well.

76
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,020
We've been monitoring your vital signs.

77
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,770
Very pleased with the results.

78
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,030
How are you feeling now that you
have been able to settle in?

79
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,710
Good!

80
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,080
Station is in pretty decent shape.

81
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,060
The only device that seems
really out of whack is the RS7 pomp.

82
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,420
It seems to be operating
in half pressure.

83
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,440
Don't worry we will add it
to the repair sheet.

84
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,470
Well for the sake of futur
ISS inhabitants I strongly recommand it.

85
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,740
Do you receiving the data package?

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,610
Yeah, I just started.

87
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,740
Houston this thing ain't opening,
do you want to resend it?

88
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,190
No why don't you give the audio a try?

89
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,110
Alright one moment.

90
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,300
[Audio] Captaine Lee Miller !

91
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,720
We've recorded this the other night.

92
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,480
My God.

93
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,080
[Audio] We haven't been in space
in almost 20 years now, right?

94
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,140
[Audio] I gotta say I feel so
honored and thankful...

95
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,870
I sound terrible.

96
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,230
[Audio] to be one of the first
to be going back after so long.

97
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,260
I'll make sure the guys
get the visual for you.

98
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,590
[Audio] I a little nervous, but...

99
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,010
We have a com link test down here at
23h00 so back to you in the morning.

100
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,390
Alright you guys have a good night.

101
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,680
Likewise.

102
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,400
Houston to Cambridge, out.

103
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,390
[RADIO] Troops with armored vehicles,
machine guns,

104
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,810
didn't feel comfortable going to that
area, in the aftermath of the bombing.

105
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,690
ISS module this is 23 alpha into
Cambridge, how do you read, over?

106
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,940
ISS module this is 23 alpha into
Cambridge, how do you read, over?

107
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,210
Copy that, this is ISS.

108
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,630
ISS, this is 23 alpha.

109
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,570
Can you transmit your
orbital bearing numbers?

110
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,250
We are doing a quick line up test.

111
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:22,830
OK

112
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,110
Give us 8 packets,
we will figure the constant.

113
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,060
8 packets, is a hell of a projection.

114
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,140
Yeah,

115
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,030
well they want to see if the ISS will
stay in orbit without remote positioning.

116
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,410
Copy that,
did you receive them?

117
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,430
Looks like it, thanks.

118
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,760
How are you holding up?

119
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,340
Good!

120
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,640
Good.

121
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,870
Well,
I don't want to keep you.

122
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,190
23 Apha out.

123
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,270
Godspeed Lee.

124
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,740
Godspeed to you too.

125
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,820
ISS 32 this is mission controle,
Cambridge.

126
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,190
Did you receive our data package.

127
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,410
Copy that.
It's downloading right now.

128
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,300
You guys rezip for the clip
of the Late Show.

129
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,400
Negatif.

130
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,030
I believe the chef will
get that to you later.

131
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,590
This is a recorded message
from your brother.

132
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,290
Copy that.

133
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:53,890
Cheers.

134
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,750
Hey buddy,
I hope everything is going well up there.

135
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,150
Thinking about you.

136
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,720
But, the important news is
you are officially an uncle.

137
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,570
You've got a nephew,

138
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,220
and he is beautiful,
it's just incredible.

139
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,470
He can't wait to meet you.

140
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,570
I'm gonna try to send some
photos if I can figure out.

141
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,800
It's so complicated to do
that with these guys.

142
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,150
Anyway,

143
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,190
take care of yourself please.

144
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,050
I will talk to you soon, bye.

145
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,390
Hey Houston,
did you picked that up?

146
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,280
Cambridge,
have I been crossed over yet?

147
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,410
Cambridge, this is ISS 37 did you guys
pick up that radio interference?

148
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,830
That's a tough one.

149
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,990
People need other people.

150
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,900
That's why I really think I'm a storyteller,

151
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,940
I will get into situations where

152
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,600
my priority is I shouldn't
stick my nose in,

153
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,510
but I do.

154
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,430
Because I feel that...

155
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
I've seen a lot,

156
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,290
I've been through a lot.

157
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,250
That's really my opinion,
that's the only way to really

158
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,080
communicate in modern races
and the people of the world.

159
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,320
If I can drop a word here or there
or a little tale here or there,

160
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,730
that I think might help somebody.

161
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,830
I'd drop it like a bomb.

162
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,550
If something like that ever did happen,
where everybody stop talking

163
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,330
everybody stop telling stories,
everybody stop relating.

164
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,080
Nobody learns anything.

165
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,460
No one does anything?

166
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,410
I probably not even want
to think what it would be like.

167
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,380
Maybe peaceful as hell.

168
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,090
I think it would be a horrible world.

169
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,940
MC this is ISS,
do you guys have a read on me?

170
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,960
MC this is ISS,
do you copy?

171
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,680
This is genius.

172
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,670
Make a big radio with English buttons,
and then...

173
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,020
write a manual for it in Russian!

174
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,890
Houston this is ISS,
do you copy?

175
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,140
Houston? Cambridge?
Do you copy?

176
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,220
Cambridge this is ISS,
do you copy?

177
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,690
Cambridge this is ISS,
do you copy?

178
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,890
Hello Lee.

179
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,410
Sorry I'm sending
this message as recording,

180
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,460
but to be honest,

181
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,490
it's the best I can do right now.

182
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,630
So,

183
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,910
I kind of dare that
I don't ever tell you this directly,

184
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,190
but we had so shit
going on down here that I...

185
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,830
I don't even know where to begin.

186
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,510
Even if I wanted
to bring you out of orbit,

187
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,360
I don't have the people to do it.

188
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,910
Look, we're gonna need
you to sit tight for a while.

189
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,220
I'm sorry.

190
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm sorry.

191
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,690
I don't know what kind
of transmission that was,

192
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,960
and unless I'm mistaken
we're nowhere near April.

193
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,470
So I'm gonna need a confirmation of any
sort of mission extension from you assholes!

194
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,280
Look, I don't think it's funny,

195
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,990
and if you guys are doing
some type of stress experiments,

196
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,580
or isolation test,

197
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,510
well then you can stop now because...

198
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,330
because I'm very isolated
and very stressed!

199
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,610
If the line is open enough
for me to get a pre recorded message

200
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,230
then I know you can hear me

201
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,750
and I would appreciate knowing...

202
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,540
What the hell is going on?

203
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,250
Houston?

204
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,630
Cambridge?

205
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,630
This is ISS,
do you copy?

206
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,900
When...

207
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,510
that interactivity is suddenly just cut,

208
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,710
you're just left, standing by yourself,

209
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,970
in the darkness.

210
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,050
I didn't see that coming,
what was that all about?

211
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,650
Where do I go from here?

212
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,150
I think we control
our own surrounding...

213
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,140
For the most part,
we control our own surrounding,

214
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,220
we can decide to go here or there.

215
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,850
But once we have established ourself,

216
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,580
I think that's when

217
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,790
our environment starts
to take a toll on our personality,

218
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,420
our habits,

219
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,370
the way we think every day.

220
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,510
We are social creatures
and we need to interact with people.

221
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,050
that's why relationships are so...
important

222
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:08,360
so crucial for existence.

223
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,770
Because if you don't talk to anybody,
you don't interact with anybody,

224
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,920
your all sense of reality
is pretty warped.

225
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
Physical diagnostic check...

226
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,580
lots of glass, plastic or metal.

227
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,910
I should make a proper introduction
since I am the captain.

228
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,810
My name is Lee.

229
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,800
And you are?

230
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,560
You're an astronaut.

231
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,180
You're a polaroid I'm talking to.

232
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,070
This place sucks.

233
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,970
These guys have definitely
won a space trip in orbit.

234
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,590
You on the other hand...

235
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,420
well, if I was on your mission
we would definitely had some problems.

236
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,910
God, I love you smile.

237
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,520
How about this,
I get you to buy off this joint,

238
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,540
get back home,

239
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,080
take a shower,

240
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,860
put on a suit,

241
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,110
we head downtown,

242
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,040
East Village

243
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,520
great little Italian restaurant.

244
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,730
But hell, what I'm making it up,
how about a nice Malibu sunset?

245
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:32,680
It's the best...

246
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,920
Malibu sunset.

247
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,220
God...

248
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,360
I gotta say

249
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,820
I feel so honored and thankful to be...

250
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,530
Who's idea was it
to try to make a shower?

251
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,020
I want a shower.

252
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,910
Three seconds on the shot clock...

253
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,620
ball passed into play...

254
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,280
goes to Miller...

255
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,050
he shoots.

256
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,390
Roll it.

257
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,680
Hey buddy,
I hope everything is going well up there

258
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,780
OK,

259
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,830
where the hell is my fucking video.

260
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,940
Fuck!

261
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,490
Why am I funny?

262
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,140
Where are you going?

263
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,300
I've got to reroute some power.

264
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,070
Why?

265
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,320
Because...

266
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,700
The station is broken.

267
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,620
Do you think you are broken?

268
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,670
I'm choosing to entertain you because A

269
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,460
my logic slipped a long time ago,
and B...

270
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,040
I forgot what B was, but

271
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
make a pretty good reason in your head

272
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,360
it's probably in mine too.

273
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,580
Journal of Captain Lee Briggs.

274
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,200
22nd Connecticut,
seventh infantry division.

275
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,690
My personal thoughts and findings
leading to our discovery.

276
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:09,000
June 4th, 1864

277
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,260
You know,
you can plan life,

278
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,470
but yet

279
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,670
it doesn't mean it's gonna happen.

280
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,720
You can,

281
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,380
plan and plan and... plan and

282
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,090
put something over here,
and design something over here

283
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,970
and put borders on
this and that in life

284
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,310
but it doesn't mean anything.

285
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,100
Because you're not in control.

286
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,620
Because nothing is guaranteed,
nothing is secured in this world.

287
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,920
So,

288
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,030
what is the most important thing?

289
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,650
I mean,
everybody wants to be loved,

290
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,150
and when you actually,

291
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,200
feel it,
I mean kind of like with your parents

292
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,580
it's kind of one of those things where

293
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:00,740
it's just is what it is
because you grow up into it,

294
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,340
but when you actually experience it
with someone else outside of that shell.

295
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,580
It's...

296
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,440
very interesting.

297
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,460
Very fulfilling.

298
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,350
Are you waiting for someone?

299
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,880
Why are you sitting by yourself?

300
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,940
What is your favorite season?

301
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,130
I forgot.

302
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,550
There are no seasons...

303
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,240
just time.

304
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,660
We found defeat again
in Chancellorsville.

305
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,190
It's quite an unsettling feeling,
to face one's nerves this often.

306
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,110
To accept death before each
call to advance is frightening.

307
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,710
Yet it is the only way
to move boots made solid

308
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:19,120
by the sound of shelling.

309
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,230
I can't explain all this,

310
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,780
what uncertainty does to a man's soul,

311
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,360
but I do know it can drive the mind mad.

312
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:54,270
17.000 dead in one engagement.

313
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,840
The mind is like a closed grave.

314
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,340
Some say it was the grace of God

315
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,260
that gives us the strength to bear
the shaking timbers and falling Earth.

316
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,550
Most would agree
there was just no where to go.

317
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,420
I hate sevens, I hate sevens!

318
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,970
It so a loser.

319
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:13,280
Ok,
this is the space station.

320
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,190
We are approximately
220 miles from Earth, ok?

321
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:28,140
You see, the original space station,
was what they call L.E.O

322
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,930
stands for Low Earth Orbiting.

323
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:34,850
Later,

324
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,640
with this new technology,

325
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,950
we were able to go
a lot further than that.

326
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,330
Why do you think we're here?

327
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,470
Doesn't that bother
you that we are not real?

328
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,420
I don't know.

329
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:40,210
They assured me that it's not the shape,
but what lies over the ridge's crest.

330
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,810
What?

331
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:50,140
I'm looking at it from a different angle.

332
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,740
I don't like the ending either,

333
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,830
but I'm not reading it with my eyes.

334
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,440
I'm reading it through this monitor,

335
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,220
so we can make sure
that we have missed no details,

336
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,370
of your odd tale.

337
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,480
How can eyes that have seen so much

338
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,480
be brought to life by a simple thing?

339
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:26,660
It is as if we have some sort
of predestined temper of destruction.

340
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,060
I have decided I am not
looking for one discovery.

341
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:42,940
I am simply hoping that we
have a history worth remembering.

342
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:55,460
An imprint of careful design,

343
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,550
a feeling of heartfelt purpose.

344
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,910
A sense of hope and wellbeing.

345
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,700
How can you write a journal this long

346
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,210
and not tell us what you found?

347
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,420
Did you die before you had
a chance to finish the journal?

348
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,310
I mean,
all you had to do was look over the ridge,

349
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,850
and write down what you found?

350
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,910
Just,
write what you found.

351
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,260
You know, leave,
but if you leave

352
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,820
no one's gonna be
here when they come.

353
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,270
They're not gonna
leave us here forever.

354
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,180
What would we do with...

355
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,580
all this time?

356
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,970
I know,
I know!

357
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,180
Hey, is your mouth dry?

358
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,610
Yeah mine too,
mine too.

359
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,310
Am I scared?

360
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,270
You gotta be living to be scared.

361
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:36,470
My mane is Lee James Miller

362
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,970
son of Courtney and Michael Miller.

363
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,280
I lost contact

364
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,390
with mission control

365
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,190
on July 7th 2039.

366
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,960
I have remained in a perennial orbit

367
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,010
for six years.

368
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,070
My mission has long
since been terminated

369
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:07,110
and my daily routine has been based
on stretching my life support systems.

370
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,300
I've observed

371
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:15,630
neither contact nor indication of
any awareness of my current condition.

372
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,740
It is with great sadness

373
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,820
but determined resolution,

374
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,660
that I must finally abandoned this post.

375
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,920
Systems here,
can no longer be depended on

376
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,866
and I would rather faced the
journey home than a slow,

377
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:38,630
breathless,
environment of failing O2.

378
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,950
Well I have no idea what the circumstances
are surrounding my abandonment.

379
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:51,240
I would rather rest on Earth,
than up here alone.

380
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,890
I have come to terms with the fact that
some things will forever remain a mystery.

381
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,780
To whomever this message reaches,

382
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,110
I leave it goodwill toward all.

383
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,270
Respectfully...

384
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,000
Captaine Lee James Miller.

385
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,330
July 7th 2045.

386
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,860
When you get into a situation
where absolutly nothing is in your control,

387
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,100
it makes you wonder sometimes.

388
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,870
And very often
I've been in those circumstances

389
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,390
where all of a sudden,

390
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,510
you're not calling the shots,
you're basically around for the ride.

391
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,860
I mean even on a simplistic note,

392
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,880
I lost a wheel of a vehicle,

393
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,810
of the van.

394
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,208
Couple of years ago,
taking my son to school.

395
00:58:09,209 --> 00:58:11,440
In really pretty heavy traffic.

396
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,580
It could have been an absolute disaster,

397
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,408
but all of a sudden I'm
driving down the road

398
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,240
and the passenger wheel overtakes us.

399
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,280
I was along for the ride,

400
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:22,950
there was nothing I could do because
I had no brakes, no steering

401
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,840
and it was just really fortunate
that the van veered off to the right.

402
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,030
It could have gone into the incoming traffic,
it could have been an all disaster.

403
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:32,857
It's really rather surprising

404
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:36,060
what flashes through your mind
in those few split seconds

405
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,170
while this stuff is going on.

406
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:41,680
I mean you think about
all sort of strange things.

407
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,170
But for people to remember me,

408
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,195
or, any, one particular thing,

409
00:58:47,196 --> 00:58:50,610
I think it would be for the
fact that never give up.

410
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,660
Just keep trying,

411
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,290
don't just accept it and say

412
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:58,950
"Yes this is what it is."
Strive for something better.

413
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:28,910
Euh, the space station has
been empty for a long time, right?

414
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:33,010
So when you get there, I mean,
is there any housework to do?

415
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:36,240
I mean is there gonna be like dishes
in the sink, you gotta clean up?

416
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,870
No, there is no house chores
or dishes in space, thank God.

417
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:46,430
We haven't been in space
in almost 20 years now, right?

418
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,740
How do you feel about that?

419
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,330
I feel so honored to be one of the
first to be going back after so long.

420
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:56,100
A little nervous but...
but excited.

421
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:02,640
Now I assumed that the testing and the
preparation has been quite extensive.

422
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,960
Sorry about this projection,
but it the only way we could reach you.

423
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,190
I can't tell you how relieve
we are to have you here.

424
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:10,480
Now...

425
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,590
before we got ahead of ourself,
we have to tell you something.

426
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,730
You are the last one.

427
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,990
It's all gone.

428
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:30,610
We understand how you might feel.

429
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,040
Connection is perhaps the most
cherished thing any being can have.

430
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,850
That's the thing.

431
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,670
That's why we have been listening.

432
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,760
The place you see here
is a scrap of sources.

433
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:58,550
A collection of memories and
mementos of mankind brief existence.

434
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,600
You got to remember the good things,

435
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,370
and cherish the memories.

436
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,030
And go on on life and don't stop.

437
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,990
You only have to remember
that what you have done in your life

438
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,680
may change what someone
else is doing their life

439
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,760
and so therefore,
your life continues in their eyes.

440
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:22,010
It's a good thing we found you.

441
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,740
We look forward to meeting you Lee.

442
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:29,430
Detecting live.

443
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,750
Verified location.

444
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,970
Good evening.

445
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:40,190
Tonight has been a wonderful
experiment... of human contact.

446
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,360
A symbiotic relationship
between man and machine,

447
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,740
and you.

448
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:56,130
The human brain is capable
of millions of connections.

449
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:00,540
Each one is a memory, an event.

450
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,990
Tonight should not be
remembering by one,

451
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:06,940
but by thousands of these relationships.

452
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,910
As you leave here tonight,

453
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,150
close you eyes and travel back to here,

454
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:15,800
to now.

455
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:22,290
And always remember that this
was one moment, you were not alone,

456
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:27,900
and you felt something that
thousands of others have felt.

457
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:29,750
And it was...

458
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,170
Love.
