3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,300
<i>Our world was created by
a miraculous force called "The AllSpark". </i>

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,040
<i>With the AllSpark, there was no strife,
no inequity and no need for war. </i>

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,000
<i>In my life time and that of a generation
before me, we knew only peace. </i>

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>A peace that flourished
under the reign of Optimus Prime... </i>

7
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,300
<i>... and the Lord high protector,
Megatron. </i>

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
<i>At first, Prime and Megatron
ruled as equals, ... </i>

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>... the one fair, the other firm. </i>

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
<i>Then something changed in Megatron. </i>

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,300
<i>And what happened next
none of us saw coming. </i>

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,000
<i>He struck us from within, his goal
to possess the all-powerful AllSpark... </i>

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,742
<i>... for his own twisted purposes. </i>

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,700
<i>Those of us loyal to Optimus Prime, ... </i>

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>... swore to defend the AllSpark
at all costs. </i>

16
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,300
None of our lives matter!

17
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,300
The AllSpark is all.
With the AllSpark...

18
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,750
... new life can arise.
Whether here or elsewhere.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
Only a trusted few know this...

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,000
... but preperations are underway
to send the AllSpark into deep space.

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Better that than allow,
Lord Megatron to possess it, to corrupt it.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Remember, as long as
there is hope...

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
... there is life.

24
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,400
The AllSpark!

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,300
Prime, you fool!
Even now you underestimate me!

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,600
My job is done. The AllSpark is
finally beyond your reach.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
You! You have cost me
the AllSpark! You!

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,600
It seems I must do this
the hard way.

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,000
It may take longer,
the result will be the same.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
On the day I claim
the AllSpark as my own...

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,800
... all of Cybertron will fall
and the universe itself will tremble.

32
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,855
<i>My arm has eventually reattached... </i>

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,650
<i>... but my voice capacitor
had shattered beyond repair. </i>

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>It is decided, we too must venture
out beyond Cybertronium space... </i>

35
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,500
<i>... to find the AllSpark before Megatron. </i>

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,900
<i>I still wonder,
did I do enough?</i>

37
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,375
<i>Perhaps like Megatron said,
all I did... </i>

38
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,150
<i>... was delay the inevitable.
And perhaps helped spread our war... </i>

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>... to other worlds. </i>

40
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,100
It is near.
It calls to me.

41
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,900
The AllSpark!

42
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,900
Terra firma...
Seems anything but to me.

43
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,300
The matter beneath my feet
is both unknown and unstable.

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,500
Too late. I realize, my own massive
and external body temperature...

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
... spell my downfall!

46
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,900
No! The AllSpark!
Not when I was so close!

47
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Over here!

48
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,700
What is it, Danko?

49
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,600
Something under the ice, captain.

50
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,900
Whatever it is, it set the dogs off
something rotten.

51
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,700
It's big. Must be down,
what, ten, fifteen feet?

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,500
- Winky, hand me a pick.
- Captain Witwicky, wait!

53
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,800
We had more'n our share
bad luck this vogaye.

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Perhaps it's the Fates, telling us
to leave well 'nuff alone.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Sorry, Danko.

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
But I didn't come all this way
to be well 'nuff alone.

57
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,700
I tell you,
I saw the face of the devil!

58
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
It's eyes burned.

59
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,000
And that...
was the last thing that I saw.

60
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,700
That's not quite true,
is it Captain Witwicky?

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,200
In fact, according to those members
of your crew we interviewed...

62
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
... you retained measure of sight
for some three months after the incident...

63
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,850
... in the Arctic Circle,
during which time...

64
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,300
... you filled no less than
176 sheets of these papers...

65
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,700
... with these curious designs.

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,300
Care to tell us what they mean?

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Mean?

68
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,200
I... I...
I was possessed.

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,300
That thing... looked into my soul!

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,100
I saw the future.

71
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:08,505
Their war. Our world.

72
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,700
Yes, well...
We'll get back to you.

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
- Well?
- Irredeemably insane.

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Brought on by the extreme
rigors of the voyage.

75
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,100
At least that we'll put out.

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,800
- So, you believe him, then?
- Oh, yes. He saw something.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
It's just the matter what exactly?

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,300
What about Witwicky's
personal effects?

79
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,987
They can go to the family, after all
he's hardly likely to be needing these.

80
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,200
When do we leave?

81
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,200
Morning tide. The legislature
has granted us unlimited funds.

82
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,500
And kiss your wife and children if I were you,
you may not be seeing them for some time.

83
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Call this intuition but I have
a feeling that after this one...

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,300
... nothing will ever be same again.

85
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,000
Where is he?

86
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,000
Where'd you think?

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,600
- He's talking to it again, is he?
- Ah-ha. Downright strange, if you ask me.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,700
I didn't.

89
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:18,645
Won't be long now.

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,400
As soon as the environment dome is complete,
we can begin the excavation properly.

91
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,100
You and I,
we're going to make history.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
You what? No.
No, honestly I don't think...

93
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,500
... he'll care what you've
found in Colorado.

94
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,986
Wild horses couldn't drag him away
from his so-called "Mega-man".

95
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,100
Symbols, you say.
I don't...

96
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
I thought that'd get your attention.

97
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,400
Whatever's down there, is not only
generating more power than Chicago...

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,600
... it's covered with the same symbols
your Captain Witwicky got all worked up about.

99
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,500
- Quite something, isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose it is.

100
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You were there, weren't you?
When they dug him out of the ice?

101
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,700
Yes, I was there.

102
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
In many ways "Project Mega-man"
has been my life's work.

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,000
And now he is coming here,
to the Hover Dam.

104
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,545
Yes.

105
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,750
Do you know what
Captain Archibald Witwicky was...

106
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:20,750
... purported to have said after they dragged
him screaming from that icy crevasse.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
No. What?

108
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,500
"Mine eyes have seen the glory!"

109
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,600
I believe I know what he meant.

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,300
Do you think they'll come? Others?

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,000
Not in my lifetime, maybe not even
in yours but they will come.

112
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,900
We could pour other six million tons
of concrete on top of it...

113
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,775
... and they still sniff it out.

114
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,400
- If they do find it...
- Not if... when?

115
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,400
<i>Uplink enabled. Downloading
images to your VTP site now. </i>

116
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Roger, Hubble.
Processing data stream.

117
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,900
Get me the watch commander!

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's confirmed.
We have a visitor.

119
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,000
We sectioned all of Hubble's
routine surveillance footage of Mars...

120
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
... for the immediate period
before and after the planetfall.

121
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,400
As you can see,
it's what we've been waiting for.

122
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,500
- Same species?
- Looks that way.

123
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
As far as we can tell...

124
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,400
... it arrived under it's own steam,
within some kind of space going carapace.

125
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,200
On touchdown, it transformed.

126
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,600
- Then Mega-man has a relative?
- Exactly.

127
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,700
Tactical teams are on stand by.
As soon as the visitor makes his move...

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
... we make ours.

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, that is
what I called a sand trap.

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Hilarious.
This is him, right? N. B. E-2?

131
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,500
Right. But where is he?
We tracked him the entire way down...

132
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:13,325
... and had the impact area
secured within ten minutes.

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
It should be still here,
inside our perimeter.

134
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,500
What's over there,
beyond those trees?

135
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
The I-64.

136
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Come on, come on.

137
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Damn!

138
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Get me satellite surveillance!
Target is mobile.

139
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I repeat, target is mobile!

140
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Show me.

141
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,700
Here's the specific grid vector
surveillance footage you wanted.

142
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,100
Based on your rough time frame.

143
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,500
I've enlarged
and enchanced the image.

144
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,500
What? What am I
supposed to be looking at?

145
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll freeze the image.
There.

146
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,700
Yellow Chevy Camaro number 1.
We figure it for a '75 or a '76.

147
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,600
Then exactly
fifty-eight seconds later...

148
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,900
... Chevy Camaro number 2.
- Well, I'll be...

149
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:04,925
Our boy is a mimic. He must have, what,
scanned first Camaro and then transformed.

150
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,300
I want a team of six, scrutinizing
every inch of traffic camera footage...

151
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,550
... from I-64 to west.
Try and track his progress.

152
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:16,100
- Where do you think he's headed?
- No idea. Chances are he doesn't, either.

153
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,400
But we have to assume he has
the wherewithal to find his way there.

154
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,700
My legacy?
I have a legacy?

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
That's right son. Courtesy of
my great grandfather...

156
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,750
... your great great grandfather
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

157
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,175
- He was an explorer.
- Fantastic!

158
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
What is it?
Gold coins? Rubies?

159
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,200
- Junk?
- That junk, Sam, ...

160
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:42,225
... is all that's left of Archibald's
last great voyage to the arctic circle.

161
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,600
He was a true pioneer.
A trailblazer, he was...

162
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,800
Insane? According to this, they
stuck him in a mental hospital...

163
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:50,225
... and pretty much
threw away the key.

164
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
Great. I'm descended
from a madman.

165
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,700
Hey, hey! No one ever proved
there was any actual mental illness.

166
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,800
My father told me
he was just traumatized.

167
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,325
<i># I haven't found... </i>

168
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:24,050
<i>#... what I'm looking for</i>

169
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,760
<i># I haven't found... </i>

170
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:33,275
<i>#... what I'm looking for</i>

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,900
So, who is this guy
they're sending in?

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,900
A specialist.
That's all they told me.

173
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,900
Seems he's to be in overall
charge of the operation.

174
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,400
Say that's Oppenheimer, isn't it?
What's the connection?

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,800
He was part of the original think-tank.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,200
Set up to analyse and apply
the science behind N. B. E-1.

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
- N. B. E. -1?
- Yep.

178
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,100
How else do you think
we won space race?

179
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,750
So, all these...

180
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,700
Gentleman.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

181
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I am Agent Simmons.

182
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,100
- Right. The specialist. And this?
- This is... bait.

183
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,700
<i>- Where are we headed?
- New Mexico. </i>

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,900
An old cold war bunker. It's been adapted
for our use in exactly this kind of scenario.

185
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
And you figure
you can just reel him in?

186
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,900
Absolutely. N. B. E. -2 is here
for the same reason N. B. E-1 was.

187
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,600
He's looking for the cube.
And we are gonna let him think...

188
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,900
... he's found it.

189
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,100
Is that simple, huh?

190
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,700
We just wait for him to show up
and than tag and bag.

191
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,225
Yeah. It's that simple.

192
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,000
Look, it's not like we don't know
what we're dealing with here.

193
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,800
Primitive.

194
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,500
Yes but evidence of
intelligent life nonetheless.

195
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
We'll need to proceed
with caution.

196
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,100
Fine. As long as we get to kill
something along the way.

197
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>Say again,
Bravo-Echo-Niner-Six. </i>

198
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:32,175
<i>I repeat, I have
an uniditified impact... </i>

199
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,700
<i>... within Raptor designated test area.
I'm detouring to investigate. </i>

200
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,000
<i>Bravo-Echo-Niner-Six, please give us
your current course and position. </i>

201
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
<i>Roger, control.
I switched to bearing... </i>

202
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,500
<i>What the... </i>

203
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,100
I have what I need.
You can go now.

204
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Report!

205
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,800
Blackout here. Planetfall
was clean. No witnesses.

206
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,700
Local camouflage enabled.

207
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,900
- Barricade?
- Yeah. Same.

208
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,900
Well, no living witnesses.
What's our next move Starscream?

209
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,000
Lock onto my position and reunify.

210
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,500
Then we find ourselves the AllSpark.

211
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,400
- And Megatron?
- Right, yeah. Him, too.

212
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
What is it?

213
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,400
An isotope, derived from
the sub-atomic matter of the Cube.

214
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
It's artificial, of course.
Last time someone tried...

215
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,650
... to actually substract matter
from the Cube itself...

216
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,500
... well, three mile island anyone?

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,600
So this isotope, it's giving off the same
sort of energy signature as the Cube?

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,600
Almost identical. And when
N. B. E. -2 picks up the scent...

219
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,850
... we'll be ready.

220
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
<i># There's one more ghost here</i>

221
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,000
<i># And he sits in your chair</i>

222
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,557
<i>They're coming. None of us safe here.
They're coming here. </i>

223
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600
<i># And he lays down his head</i>

224
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,601
<i># On your... </i>

225
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,500
Two days now and nothing.
Maybe only the real deal will do.

226
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,000
Patience. Patience. We waited
over a hundred years for this...

227
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,700
... another day or so won't hurt.

228
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,200
You know something, Agent Simmons?
More time I spend with you...

229
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
... more I think this is,
well, personal somehow.

230
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
You could say bagging N. B. E. 's
runs in the family.

231
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Wait, you aren't...

232
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Ever since that first one
came out of the ice...

233
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,900
... under the watchful eye
of my great grandfather...

234
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,400
... it's been a waiting game.

235
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,100
Sir, delta-seven eye reports
a positive sighting.

236
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
N. B. E. -2 is within the perimeter.

237
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,700
Alert all Tac-Teams.
But tell them to hold position.

238
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,900
No one is going to engage
until I give the signal.

239
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:54,500
Yes, sir. I'll...
MM. Go ahead delta-seven.

240
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,800
- Understood.
- What is it?

241
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:58,025
Local law enforcement in pursuit.

242
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Get rid of them. Invoke whatever
national security protocols you see fit...

243
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,000
... but have them
brake of the pursuit, now!

244
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Yes, sir.
According to this...

245
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,000
... none of the New Mexico divisions
has an unit in the area.

246
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,950
- Out of state?
- No. Nothing.

247
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,000
- It's another one.
- N. B. E. -3?

248
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Or more.

249
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
So much for the element of surprise!

250
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
All teams, converge
on the acquisition site!

251
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,100
Target is now a MH-53 helicopter.
I repeat, a MH-53 helicopter.

252
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Starscream, whatever downs there,
it's not the AllSpark! This is a set-up!

253
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,500
Intelligent and prepared, huh?
I'm started to like it here.

254
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,600
<i>Ready catch nets and prepare
for cyro-immobilization. </i>

255
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,550
<i>Roger that. </i>

256
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,400
Huh. Not on your best day.

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,700
Sir, we've lost
Apaches One and Two!

258
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
- Have the other squads move in.
- But sir...

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,900
Do it!

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,900
I can do this all day.
But it occurs to me...

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
... if these beings knew enough to simulate
AllSpark's resonant energy signature, ...

262
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,900
... it's likely they know
where the actual AllSpark is.

263
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,100
You keep them busy, Starscream.

264
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
- What's happening?
- Something is in our network.

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,400
It's going through our security
firewalls like they weren't there!

266
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,500
Break our connection
to the S-7 mainframe.

267
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Purge all on-site systems.
Do it, now!

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Damn! Starscream...

269
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,050
... they cut me off.

270
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,000
- Get anything?
- Not much. A name, Sector Seven.

271
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,900
Otherwise, it's a dead end.

272
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
- Maybe not.
- Barricade?

273
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,850
I was tracking an Autobot
in local camouflage.

274
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,800
Only he got wise to me
before I could take him out.

275
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,600
- And?
- And...

276
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Now I figure to maybe
cut him loose, let him run.

277
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,475
No telling how long
he's been here, on this planet...

278
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
... and what other leads
he may have.

279
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,400
So we sit back and let him
lead us to the AllSpark.

280
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,900
Do it but make it look convincing.

281
