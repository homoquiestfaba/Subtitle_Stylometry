00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,151
JOE CAMPBELL
(VOICEOVER): Well, we're

2
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,289
Leaving that all behind, both
of us, just for a few days.

3
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,656
I'm just passing through.

4
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:07,428
He works back there in one of
those pin-striped buildings.

5
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,497
He sells stock now.

6
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,899
His name is Fletcher.

7
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:12,800
Fletcher Cain.

8
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:19,407
If he couldn't add it, subtract
it, multiply or divide it,

9
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,310
Fletcher wouldn't know what
the hell to do with it.

10
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,244
Don't get me wrong.

11
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,012
I love the guy.

12
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,414
It was great to see him again.

13
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,354
This was the hunting trip we'd
always promised ourselves,

14
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,956
Before we'd gone off
our separate ways,

15
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:40,761
College, the Army, time flies.

16
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,296
I hadn't seen him
in years, and it

17
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,199
Was to perfect day, the
sunshine, the birds,

18
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,602
Like, kind of like God
was looking down on us.

19
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:52,840
And the city didn't even exist.

20
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,076
I had spent a lot of
time back in these woods.

21
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,778
I loved it here.

22
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,814
To me, the trees were like home.

23
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,351
But to Fletcher,
like always, a tree

24
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,719
Was something that grew in
the front yard for a dog

25
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,255
To piss on.

26
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,422
He had a lot to learn.

27
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:15,062
Fletcher, where did
you get all this stuff?

28
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,198
What's a credit card
and a telephone for?

29
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,334
And a company runner.

30
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,535
You know what I like?

31
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,203
I like it because it means
you're getting into it

32
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,204
And that's good.

33
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,172
Oh, hey.

34
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,346
Oh, flowers for me?

35
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,681
Fletcher, I didn't
know you cared.

36
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,783
Camouflage.

37
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,052
Had to run home at
lunch for this thing.

38
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,154
These things aren't exactly
welcome at Son Sweeney.

39
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:41,955
Why?

40
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,790
Somebody might use it?

41
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,591
These days.

42
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,762
You know, Fletch,
I brought you one.

43
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,365
Bequeathed, my mother.

44
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,166
She was quite a shot.

45
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,735
Bullshit.

46
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,304
Mother used to be.

47
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,838
Never had the touch
for this stuff.

48
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,347
You know, they
only made about 700

49
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:11,352
Of these Winchester model 21s.

50
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,220
So what, I can't
get bullets for it?

51
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:16,990
Shells, Fletch,
not bullets, shells.

52
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,791
Check it out.

53
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,528
Look at that balance.

54
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,029
Want to sell this?

55
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,531
It was my mother's.

56
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,365
What's it worth?

57
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,600
About $30,000.

58
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,604
$30,000?

59
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,941
One could buy a Porsche
with this thing.

60
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,676
Try not to drop it.

61
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,957
JOE CAMPBELL (VOICEOVER): We
grew up together, same town.

62
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:53,093
Except see, his father
seemed to own most of it.

63
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:56,530
They lived in a big house,
four car garage, swimming pool.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,267
They even had a
high diving board.

65
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:02,803
After school, we'd all be there,
all the neighborhood kids,

66
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,339
Making like he was their
best friend, because he

67
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,841
Had a pool with a high dive.

68
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,778
I remember those days.

69
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,046
Fletcher used to stand
on that damn board

70
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,682
Out at the edge,
seemed like hours,

71
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,250
Just waiting,
holding everybody up.

72
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,654
The other kids, stacked up
on that ladder, shivering,

73
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,358
Would start yelling at
him, jump, Meathead.

74
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,227
I used to tell him, Fletch,
once you're up there,

75
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,896
There's no way back.

76
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,498
No way.

77
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,735
Until one day, that day I got
tired of freezing behind him.

78
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,869
I walked out to the edge.

79
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,938
He looked at me.

80
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,773
I pushed him.

81
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,644
And that was the day we
became friends, that day I

82
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,713
Pushed him off, like a brother.

83
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,620
Come on, come on, boy.

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,088
[Bark]

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,839
What are you doing?

86
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,808
[Gunshot]

87
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,943
This used to be Campbell land.

88
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:55,849
New boots.

89
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,355
You got a lot to learn.

90
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,257
Suppose I die of pneumonia?

91
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,560
Yeah, well, serves you right.

92
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,928
It's cold.

93
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,197
Lesson number one,
you break in the boots

94
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,466
Before you go hunting.

95
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,568
Great, wet boots all day.

96
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,904
And by tonight, they'll be
dry and fit you like a glove.

97
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:17,905
Stop crying.

98
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:18,706
Here.

99
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,247
Sorry about your mom.

100
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,082
It's all right.

101
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,985
She hated hospitals.

102
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,021
It's kind of a
blessing actually.

103
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,990
And now she's up there
with your dad, huh?

104
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,027
That great duck
blind in the sky.

105
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,531
Drinking bourbon,
telling dirty jokes.

106
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:47,968
Man, she was always pretty
good with the dirty jokes.

107
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,938
I liked her.

108
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,741
How did you turn
out such a wimp?

109
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,709
Breeding, fuck you very much.

110
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,964
[Laughing]

111
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,239
Fletch, see, no, you point.

112
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,342
Don't aim, point.

113
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,478
Point, and squeeze.

114
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,312
Don't aim.

115
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,947
Don't aim.

116
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,882
Don't aim.

117
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,683
OK.

118
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,917
Ready?

119
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:37,718
Good.

120
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:38,518
Good.

121
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,687
Ready?

122
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,655
Safety.

123
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,624
All right.

124
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,559
[Gunshot]

125
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,797
Sort of like that.

126
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,799
Let's just put them over on the
stump over there, all right?

127
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,666
I'll get the feel of it.

128
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,067
Oh, right.

129
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,336
And the quail, of course, are
just going to sit on the stump

130
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,873
While you get the feel of it.

131
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:00,874
Throw the can.

132
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,843
OK, Butch.

133
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,345
[Gunshot]

134
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,696
(WHISPERING) All right,
now wait til they flush.

135
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,665
Never shoot them on the ground.

136
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,668
You have to be neighborly
about your killing.

137
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28,636
Sounds like the office.

138
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,020
Fletch?

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,056
Huh?

140
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:51,391
Why didn't you shoot?

141
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,225
Got something in my eye.

142
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,579
Nicely situated.

143
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,081
Needs a little renovating.

144
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,549
Somebody left in a hurry.

145
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,652
Yeah, a long time ago.

146
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,387
Yeah, the valley's
full of these old dumps.

147
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,294
Wonder why nobody's claimed it?

148
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,229
County forced them out.

149
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,363
Who knows?

150
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,631
Or no water.

151
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,466
Can't brew moonshine
without water.

152
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,447
Don't do that.

153
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,415
What?

154
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,250
Don't ever reach
for a gun like that.

155
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,051
The trigger, Fletcher.

156
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,585
It's not loaded, man.

157
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,420
You don't know that.

158
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:58,591
OK?

159
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,559
Same thing.

160
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,128
My uncle died that way.

161
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:01,962
Crossing a fence.

162
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:02,863
My father tripped.

163
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,932
It wasn't loaded.

164
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,099
Sorry, my god.

165
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,836
Fletcher, a gun is
never empty, all right?

166
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,803
OK.

167
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:10,603
OK.

168
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,579
Come on, Fred.

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,914
Come on, babe.

170
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,816
So where do we
sleep tonight, Bwana?

171
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,954
I saw a big oak tree back there.

172
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,555
Make a lovely campsite.

173
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,456
Are you kidding?

174
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,725
No, let's sleep
under the stars.

175
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:35,095
Roast these birds
under a camp fire.

176
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,663
I'll tell you what, Fletch.

177
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,665
You could play Campfire
Girls if you want,

178
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,768
But I booked us into a motel.

179
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,969
Motel?
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,170
Wait a minute.

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,738
That is a denial of the
whole hunting experience.

182
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,175
What about communing
with nature?

183
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,443
I'd rather commune
with a hot shower,

184
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,779
Color TV, and clean sheets.

185
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,946
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

186
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,347
Why?

187
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,650
Because it's the last game of
the World Series, that's why.

188
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,119
Oh.

189
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,788
Let's get back to the car.
Wait a minute.

190
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,089
What do you want
to do with these?

191
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,491
Put them in your
pouch back here.

192
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,359
All right.

193
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,395
I'm heading south.

194
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,965
So we need to go north.

195
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,734
That's north.

196
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,303
Hm.
Now, Fletch.

197
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,104
Let's think about this.

198
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,438
Now that's north.

199
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:23,210
How can that be north when
the sun is setting over there?

200
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,744
I don't know, but
the needle says.

201
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,746
Forget it, Fletcher, forget it.

202
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,050
We followed this path here,
we'll just take it back.

203
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,785
The needle's just
freaking out here.

204
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,320
Where did Fred go?

205
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,121
Over there.

206
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:34,955
Fred.

207
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,957
Freddie.

208
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,192
Come here.

209
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,862
Where's he going?

210
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:42,662
Freddy.

211
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,931
He's never done that before.

212
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,398
Fred.

213
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,300
[Barking]

214
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,638
Freddy.

215
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,073
Here, Fred.

216
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:53,874
Fred.

217
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,709
Fred.

218
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,677
Here boy.

219
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,024
Freddy.

220
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:11,959
Come on boy.

221
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:12,759
Freddy.

222
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,582
Joe, Joseph.

223
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,550
I just saw a deer.

224
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,351
You're dreaming.

225
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,219
No, I swear to God.

226
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,020
It stared right at me.

227
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,088
It was beautiful.

228
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,457
Fletcher, there are
no deer in these woods.

229
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,326
There used to be, but
see, now there's no river.

230
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,627
No, no.

231
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,363
Fletcher there's no river,
because they built that dam.

232
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,065
And they built
that dam on a bond

233
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,635
Issue which you and your little
friends raised to make a buck.

234
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,270
So you didn't see a deer.

235
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,405
OK?

236
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,007
Hey, I trade paper,
for Christ sake.

237
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,209
I don't kill little
furry forest animals.

238
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,276
Not intentionally.

239
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,377
What the fuck's
happened to you?

240
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,578
What's happened to me?

241
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,014
What's happened to you?
Nothing's happened to me.

242
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:07,814
Exactly, Fletcher.

243
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,482
Nothing has happened to you.

244
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,153
Fuck!

245
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,491
Fletcher, I'm sorry.

246
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,998
I'm really sorry.

247
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:25,999
Jesus, Joe.

248
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,473
Now, come on.

249
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:38,912
Let's go and see what you can
do with that Porsche of yours.

250
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,880
Come on.

251
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,283
Freddy.

252
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,084
Come on, boy.

253
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,286
Freddy.

254
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,289
God damn dog.

255
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,958
Wait a minute.

256
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,159
Now it says that way's north.

257
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,893
This doesn't make any sense.

258
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,429
Christ, will you
stop trying to prove

259
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,332
How smart you are, Fletcher,
and put that fucking thing away?

260
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,533
I know where the trail is.

261
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,969
Yeah?

262
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,204
Where is it?

263
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:08,541
Listen, asshole, the
trail, the trail picks

264
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,311
Up again right near here, OK?

265
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,512
Let's split up.

266
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,413
You head down that way.

267
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,481
I'll go this way.
Wait a minute.

268
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,282
Are you crazy?

269
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,716
I'll never find you.

270
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:20,020
You find the path, you
fire a shot in the air,

271
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,122
And we find each other
on the sound, you got it?

272
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,356
That's a great plan.

273
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,557
Well hey, well, I'm sorry.

274
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,459
You want to stay out there
and commune with nature,

275
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,460
You be my guest, OK?

276
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,497
Fuck you.

277
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,764
Try not to stumble
through these trees

278
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,301
While these fucking rocks
break my fucking neck.

279
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,423
Hey, hey, hey.

280
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,391
You heard the lady.

281
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,059
She said, let her go.

282
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,859
OK?

283
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,667
It ain't your affair, boy.

284
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,271
Ain't you got no sense,
or you just plain deaf?

285
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,372
Look here, Billy.

286
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,608
We got us an revenuer.

287
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,111
Nah, too purty.

288
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,313
Look, I'm just looking
for a path out of here.

289
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,282
I don't know what you
do, and I don't care.

290
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,183
See that?

291
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,518
That's a path.

292
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,552
Now get out of here.

293
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,727
Let's get out of here.

294
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,162
Fletcher, Fletcher, come on.

295
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,096
Hey, Fletcher.

296
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:43,896
Hey, leave her alone.

297
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,865
Please, excuse me.

298
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:46,666
Christ, Fletcher.

299
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:50,937
Excuse me.

300
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,372
Fletcher.

301
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,207
She's obviously not
interested in you.

302
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,675
You can't just force
yourself on her?

303
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,543
You want her?

304
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,410
Fletcher.

305
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,578
No, no, I just...

306
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,646
No, you want her.

307
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,580
Fletcher.

308
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,748
No, I just think that...

309
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:09,889
Come on, get up.

310
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,325
Let's go.

311
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,294
Come on, fellas.

[Gunshot]

315
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,136
This is very attractive.

316
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:00,773
We come out here to
relax, kill a few birds,

317
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,074
Now we're being chased
through the wood

318
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:02,975
By the cast of Deliverance.

319
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,852
What?

320
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,322
What?

321
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,323
Huh?

322
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:52,725
Shh/

00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,081
Fletcher.

327
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,083
Jump.

328
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,084
What?

329
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:18,885
Jump.

330
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,152
Jump off, Fletcher.

331
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:24,657
Fletcher, just
jump the fuck off.

[Gunshot]

333
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,739
I need to get to a phone.

334
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,540
Call the police.

335
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,509
Hold him there, Pop.

336
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,282
That the one, Pop?

337
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,617
It must be.

338
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,185
It was an accident.

339
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,753
We just wanted directions.

340
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:41,921
What do you mean, we?

341
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:42,722

342
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:43,956
Who's Joe?

343
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,057
My friend.

344
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,258
Joe Campbell.

345
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,460
They chased after him.

346
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,394
Please, can you help me?

347
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:49,195
Campbell?

348
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,463
Who'd you kill?

349
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:52,899
I didn't kill anybody.

350
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,866
Eye for an eye, Pa.

351
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:54,667
They ain't never gonna...

352
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,568
Oh, hush up.

353
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,003
They were trying to kill us.

354
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,105
What are we going
to do with him Pa?

355
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:01,007
Better help me get him inside.

356
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:01,974
Can't bring in strangers.

358
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,310
We ain't animals.

We's people.

360
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,748
Now, help me get him in.

361
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,883
I never turned away
someone in need.

362
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,542
What are you doing?

363
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,545
Keep still.

364
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,913
Lord, that's need a poultice.

365
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:41,714
Shh.

00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:50,790
You made them... Thank you.

367
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,392
I didn't do it for you.

368
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,996
Can you get a message... Oh!

369
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:57,797
Shh.

370
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,499
Keep still.

371
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,500
Papa wants to talk to you.

00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,988
You brung trouble
on this house, Les.

373
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,256
No more than we already have.

374
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,358
Don't sass me.

375
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,029
What were you doing
out there, girl?

376
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:30,863
Don't matter.

377
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,465
I go where I please.

378
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:36,468
Not in this valley, you don't.

379
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:39,906
Well, he can't stay here.

380
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,574
He can't walk, Daddy.

381
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,042
He's on his way.

382
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,712
He's here now.

383
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,047
Girl, he can't stay.

384
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,718
He's on his way.

385
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:52,518
He's on his way.

386
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,690
I'll mend him quick.

387
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,490
Promise.

388
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,895
Killing's going to start.

389
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,532
Not before the stew
gets cold, it ain't.

390
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:10,036
You wash your hands over there?

391
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,571
Yes.

392
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,372
Who's that for?

393
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,613
I dinna say, get up.

394
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,586
Bless this food dear Lord.

395
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:32,959
May it nourish our bodies as
they word nourishes our souls.

396
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,060
Amen.

397
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,861
Amen.

398
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:35,662
Amen.

399
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,412
I need to get to a phone.

400
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:56,182
My friend is out there.

401
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,249
Just keep still.

402
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,417
Hush.

403
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,218
Eat.

404
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,222
Eat.

405
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,524
No.

406
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,325
Eat.

407
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,064
What is that taste?

408
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,833
Possum.

409
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:14,901
Eat.

410
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:15,702
Come on.

411
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:18,905
Possum.

412
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:19,706
Great.

413
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:24,576
Please.

414
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,411
Shh.

415
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,579
Listen to me for a short moment.

416
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,981
I need to get to a phone.

417
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,408
Joe.

418
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,209
Joe.

419
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:48,855
Joe!

420
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:00,532
Hey.

421
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:12,838
What's your name?

422
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:13,772
Fletcher Cain.

423
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,410
Oh, I ain't going to kill you.

424
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,815
You hear my dogs?

425
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,053
Sometimes I just
can't control them.

426
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,554
Call them off, Docker.

427
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,589
I don't think that
I can, Hallie, girl.

428
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:39,065
[Gunshot]

429
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:41,567
He ain't worth it.

430
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,541
I'll be coming for you, darlin'.

431
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,543
You know I will.

432
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,292
He's been buried proper.

433
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,266
What kind of people are you?

434
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,067
There's been trouble.

435
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,402
My daddy's worried.

436
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,704
What trouble can I cause?

437
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:20,106
Just came here to
hunt some quail.

438
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:24,910
All I want to do is get out of
here and back to civilization.

439
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,045
Not trouble from you.

440
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,485
From whom then?

441
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,088
My name's Hallie Campbell.

442
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:38,524
How do you do?

443
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,026
Them fellas you're
running from...

444
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:42,061
That killed Joe
and strung him up.

445
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:42,961
Them is McDonalds.

446
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,232
So?

447
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,568
Oh, I see.

448
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,270
This is some kind of
thing going on here?

449
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,206
Some sort of hillbilly thing?

450
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,142
Don't call us hillbillies.

451
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,110
They sold you a lame horse
and you blew up their still.

452
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,678
It's like out of
some stupid novel.

453
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:00,812
Jesus Christ.

454
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:01,780
Mind your mouth.

455
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,985
Sorry.

456
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,287
What are you doing?

457
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:09,088
Ow.

458
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:09,988
It's all swolled up.

459
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:10,956
Jesus.
When did this happen?

460
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,824
Now shut up.
Look, miss, I think...

461
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,661
[Scream]

462
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,129
Mornin'.

463
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,686
How do, Mr. Campbell.

464
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:44,256
Horace, how come when my throat
gets dry, you know to turn up?

465
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,491
Why, it's a gift.

466
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,261
That pop skull stuff.

467
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,296
You give that to the McDonalds.

468
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,231
Their brains is already rotted.

469
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:55,367
Would I offer a valued
customer the same swill

470
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,269
As them heathens?

471
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,405
This is bonded.

472
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,272
Daddy.

473
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:05,177
You got some of them [inaudible]

474
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,445
Miss Hallie.

475
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,246
Mr. Carlin.

476
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:13,152
Wouldn't somebody be
ailing now, would they?

477
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,327
Sure hope it's not that
fine brother of yours.

478
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,861
Back in the house, girl.

479
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:23,662
Mind your chores.

480
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,168
Don't you be buying none of
that rot guy from him, Daddy.

481
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:34,640
I'll

482
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,277
Take uh, three jars.

483
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,045
And an extra for
somebody who's lame?

484
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:47,052
[Groaning]

485
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:47,853
Pain down?

486
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,692
How long have I been out?

487
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,960
Two days.

488
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,163
What?

489
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:57,963
Water?

490
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,837
Fixing my knee?

491
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,473
Can't walk on it
for a few days.

492
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:10,142
I made you this.

493
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,042
Thank you.

494
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:11,843
No need.

495
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,348
Hallie.

496
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:19,285
What?

497
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:21,387
Do you ever see
things in the woods?

498
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:22,921
Got eyes.

499
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,223
I mean things
that aren't there.

500
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:35,901
Ah.

501
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:42,274
It's only a bad dream.

502
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,243
When you wake, you'll be
all mended and on your way

503
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:45,043
Back home.

504
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,502
Tell me more about
where you live.

505
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,470
Wouldn't like it.

506
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,805
Besides, you promised
to read to me.

507
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,241
Help me with big words?

508
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:28,754
Therefore shall ye
keep all the... all the...

509
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,456
Commandments.

510
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:36,995
Commandments which I
command you this day, that ye

511
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:41,433
May be strong and go in and...

512
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,234
Possess.

513
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,373
I know it's odd.

514
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:50,909
But the first two Ss are like
a Z, and second two aren't.

515
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:51,710
Possess.

516
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,112
Possess.

517
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:58,116
Possess the land,
which the Lord swear

518
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,852
Unto your fathers
to give unto them

519
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:05,190
And to their seed a land that...

520
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,124
Floweth.

521
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,960
Floweth with milk and honey.

522
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:20,539
For if you love the Lord your
God, and walk in all his ways,

523
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,775
Then, my Lord, drive out all
these nations before you.

524
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:31,750
And you shall possess
greater nations,

525
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,352
And mightier than yourselves.

526
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,368
So, you call me up and say
you want to buy some stock.

527
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:50,869
$0.03 cents worth.

528
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:55,040
No, you don't need
money to make money.

529
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,942
You put up your $0.03.

530
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,778
I give you three
shares at $0.10 each.

531
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:00,879
That's $0.30 altogether.

532
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,148
Now you owe me $0.27.

533
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,717
So now I owe you money
and all I got is this?

534
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:06,852
You wait... excuse me.

535
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,987
You wait for the price
of the stock to go up.

536
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:12,358
When it hits $0.20, you sell
them all, $0.60 altogether.

537
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:16,728
You pay me my $0.27,
you have a $0.33 profit.

538
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,664
So what if no one
wants to buy these?

539
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,965
Well, they will eventually.

540
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,968
Fletcher, these ain't no
good to me on the eventually.

541
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,703
I can't eat these.

542
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,974
In this valley, we
trade what we can use.

543
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:29,775
OK.

544
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,042
All right.

545
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,478
Wait a minute.

546
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:33,445
Oops.

547
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:34,646
Say it's potatoes.

548
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,615
So you sell me potatoes
and I can't pay the price.

549
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:37,416
Right.

550
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,184
It's called margin.

551
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,251
So I eat the potatoes.

552
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:41,086
Well...

553
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,522
And what are you going to eat?

554
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:44,656
Possum pizza.

555
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,857
Look, don't worry about
what I'm going to eat.

556
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,125
It ain't a fair trade.

557
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:49,761
Isn't.

558
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,398
In this valley,
you give me this,

559
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:54,800
And I trade you this right back.

560
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,603
That's fair.

561
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:01,573
It may be fair, but
it's not smart business.

562
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:05,076
It may be smart,
but it isn't nice.

563
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:21,627
If... I'll peel... If you
want, I'll peel the potatoes.

564
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,539
Hi.

565
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,077
Could I uh, need some help?

566
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:45,817
I've never done it
before, but uh...

567
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:46,752
I'd like to be of some help.

568
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,274
Whatcha doing?

569
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,375
Thinking.

570
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,878
I am good for something,
thank you very much.

571
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,980
Thinking about leaving?

572
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,214
No.

573
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,483
The Romans.

574
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,485
You know, they didn't have
anything you don't have.

575
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,487
Two thousand years ago,
they had central heating,

576
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:30,822
Indoor plumbing, highways.

577
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,925
Where did you learn all that?

578
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:34,726
Public television.

579
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,586
You like that?

580
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:35,587
It's yours.

581
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,592
No, it's yours.

582
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:41,593
Take it.

583
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:42,393
It's yours.

584
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,467
What did you do that for?

585
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,435
Huh?

586
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,103
What did you go and do that for?

587
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,772
Them McDonalds, they know
that we got him in here.

588
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:37,108
Cold day in Hades when I do
anything on the McDonald's

589
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:37,909
Say so.

590
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:45,116
You're part of this.

591
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,318
The code is broke.

592
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:48,686
They'll never rest on it.

593
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,928
An eye for an eye.

594
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,363
Why don't we finish it then?

595
00:44:58,463 --> 00:44:59,164
Let me go...

596
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,631
Oh, now sit.

597
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,540
He's not our kind.

598
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,844
Your life is here.

599
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,679
Don't you ever forget it.

600
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:48,613
You see?

601
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,085
No.

602
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:55,586
Me and the Romans, baby.

603
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:08,566
No, that's good.

604
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:09,567
Thank you, Zebediah.

605
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:00,818
What it is.

606
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,158
[Japanese]

607
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,308
Hold it.

608
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:25,343
Reach for it,
neighbor, I'll carve

609
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,744
You a brand new pretty face.

610
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,047
Jesus, you're a regular
Norman Bates, aren't you?

611
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:31,049
You want my woman?

612
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:33,018
That what you're
after, city boy?

613
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,020
That'll do, Duncan McDonald.

614
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:38,990
Oh.

615
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:11,983
Where is he?

616
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,322
I don't know.

617
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,123
Zebediah Campbell.

618
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,628
Out back.

619
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:28,399
'Bout mended up.

620
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,341
'Bout mended up.

621
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,690
He's got to go back, honey.

622
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,692
Now, I know that
as sure as I know

623
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:57,195
I got to kill Duncan McDonald.

624
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:00,198
And you do too.

625
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,433
Don't we never get
but one chance in life?

626
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:08,439
Meant like this.

627
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,308
Forever?

628
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:13,511
I never knew about these
feelings, Zebediah.

629
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:16,981
I never had a man.

630
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:20,585
I never had a chance.

631
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:21,386
No.

632
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:30,261
Sometimes in this valley,
you'd be better off if you

633
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,431
Didn't have no softness in you.

634
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,400
I don't even know how
this started, Zebediah.

635
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,906
Moon's almost full.

636
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:42,907
It's comin'.

637
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,600
These are Campbell
chickens, right?

638
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,568
Come here.

639
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:11,569
Come here.

640
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,537
Come here.

641
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:13,538
Come here.

642
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,005
I got you.

643
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:15,973
Come here.

644
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,142
Hey, you got her!

645
00:51:17,242 --> 00:51:17,942
Good boy.

646
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,910
Bring her over here.

647
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,246
Put her on the block here.

648
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:23,548
Put the hen right on
the block right there.

649
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:24,349
Stay.

650
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:25,883
Stay down.

651
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,252
Now hold her steady
when I swing.

652
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,323
You gotta hold her tight, boy.

653
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,124
Sorry.

654
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,764
Oh.

655
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:40,565
God!

656
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:41,566
Hold her over the bucket.

657
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:42,900
Let the blood drop out.

658
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,405
Oh, don't be squeamish, boy.

659
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:49,974
You gotta kill it if
you're gonna eat it.

660
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,277
I just buy some thighs
at the supermarket.

661
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:55,446
It's the law of nature.

662
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,415
You kill the next one.

663
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:58,549
You need more?

664
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,251
Got a lot of mouths to feed.

665
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:04,955
Whole family's coming, aunts,
uncles, cousins, nephews.

666
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,157
What for?

667
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,625
First footin'.

668
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:08,859
What's that?

669
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,962
Well, I'll let Hallie
explain it to you.

670
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,908
It's a hell of a celebration.

671
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,009
Excuse the language.

672
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,352
Well, want to wring
it first or chop it?

673
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,286
You go ahead.

674
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,388
I'm getting pretty
good at holding.

675
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:38,989
A man gotta learn to kill.

676
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:42,393
No.

677
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,828
What are you made of, boy?

678
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:49,967
I'll just chop it if that's OK.

679
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:56,774
Fine.

680
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:57,575
Take a swig.

681
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:58,376
Take a big one.

682
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,721
[Cough]

683
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:15,960
Come on now.

684
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,328
Swing it like a man.

685
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,467
There you go.

686
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:24,034
There you go!

687
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,475
I did it.

688
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,282
Your first kill.

689
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,119
Which one's next?

690
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:50,060
I think that brown one.

691
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,163
Brown one.

692
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,400
US poultry, down
two and an eighth.

693
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,480
I got some chickens
for you to pluck.

694
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,448
I did that.

695
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,821
So what's all this
about first footing?

696
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:20,425
Everybody brings a lump
of coal, a crust of bread,

697
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,460
And a jug of whiskey.

698
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,495
That's an interesting menu.

699
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,564
What it means, is
for the year to come,

700
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:29,834
The larder and the coal
bin will never be empty.

701
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,235
The whiskey is to
drink to good fortune.

702
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:32,036
Excuse me.

703
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:32,837
Excuse me.

704
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,204
That's a capital idea.

705
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:56,461
[Crack]

706
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,966
You... Wo!

707
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:08,539
I lost my first footing.

708
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,307
Help him back to bed, Zeb.

709
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:17,181
My good man, you are too kind.

710
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:47,812
I'm gettin' the
chores done, Daddy.

711
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:52,116
I know what's in
your head, child.

712
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:55,085
Not to be taken with that man.

713
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,857
He's just... he's
different, Daddy.

714
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,292
Different from who?

715
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:04,429
I don't know what
you're talking about.

716
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:11,736
I'm your pa, Hallie.

717
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,171
[Gunshot]

718
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:16,707
That the best you can do?

719
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,876
Kill my chicken?

720
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,177
Come on, you want to kill?

721
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:22,913
Kill me.

722
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,381
Don't stand behind no tree.

723
00:56:24,482 --> 00:56:27,418
Kill me like a man.

724
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,419
[Gunshot]

725
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,856
Don't waste no powder
on cowards, Zeb.

726
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,357
I'll see you in hell, McDonald.

727
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,180
Hi.

728
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:18,068
Who's that?

729
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,436
My great aunt.

730
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,374
Died young.

731
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:26,443
She never married.

732
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,378
Never had no chance for a man.

733
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,283
What'd she die of?

734
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,553
The feud.

735
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:36,487
Bullet in her back.

736
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,825
They all died in the same year.

737
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:46,096
Bad fight.

738
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,266
Jesus Christ.

739
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,067
Sorry.

740
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:59,910
Fighting never stops when
the harvest moon is full.

741
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,746
Has to stop sometime.

742
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:03,714
It can't.

That's the way it is.

out where you come from?

756

Afraid they do.

from being robbed.

Do you want to go back there?

760

There must be something
good out there.

Oh, sure, there is, there is.

765
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:14,885
I had that once.

766
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:16,486

767
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:17,321
What's that taste like?

Just go have fun.

Sir, would you do me the
honor of dancing with me?

You are very beautiful.

Wherever you want.

793
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,014
I'll build a house

With raining water?

795
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,684
Just like the Romans.

796
01:06:30,554 --> 01:06:31,688
And a garden.

797
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:34,324
Not just a garden of
carrots and potatoes

798

And cabbages, a garden
full of flowers.

ain't going to happen.
