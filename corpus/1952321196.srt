1
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,504
Hello?

2
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,214
Hello?

3
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,733
Hello!

4
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,396
Hello!

5
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,392
What happened?

6
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,601
Nothing, a woman answered,
but she hung up.

7
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,940
There was a weird tone,
it sounded like a recording.

8
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,856
Give me more coins.

9
00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:28,254
- That's all that's left.
- Give them to me.

10
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,719
Why spend what little we have
left on that telephone, Reina?

11
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,015
How are we supposed to let them
know we're here, huh?

12
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,168
Hello!

13
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,894
Hello, it's Reina.

14
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,786
It's Reina,
I'll call back later.

15
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,835
Why didn't you tell them
we were here?

16
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,787
You could've
given them this address.

17
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,793
I'll call them back later.

18
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,040
With what? We ran
out of coins.

19
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,312
I don't know,
someone will lend us a phone,

20
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,104
or we'll come up with an idea.

21
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,767
What idea?

22
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,204
You and your damn ideas!

23
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:30,342
Did you forget all this shit
was your idea?

24
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:32,138
Right, because
you never have any ideas.

25
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,214
Sure, just look where you
brought us.

26
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,938
Or was this rat hole
a part of your plan?

27
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,797
What were you expecting,
a suite at the Hilton?

28
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,938
No, but I thought we'd be
staying with your cousin.

29
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,245
New York is already too big
for you, Marlon.

30
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:45,646
You should've
stayed in Medellin eating shit.

31
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,023
Of course.

32
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:51,248
As if we're not screwed
and eating shit here too.

33
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:53,967
Yeah, but it's American shit,
so it's different.

34
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,337
What are we going to do?

35
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,475
Tell me, Reina,
what are we going to do?

36
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,095
Why don't you just kill
yourself, Marlon?

37
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,207
Don't you go out on the street,
Marlon Cruz!

38
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:18,446
Brooklyn, New York

39
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,634
Hey! Let go!

40
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,918
Did you find it?

41
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,988
Yeah, here it is.

42
00:07:33,092 --> 00:07:34,782
What's the matter?

43
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:36,991
You went looking for dessert,
didn't you?

44
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:40,192
No, you saw me drop it.

45
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,204
Come, let's go take a walk.

46
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,100
I'll tell my father
we're going out.

47
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,996
Hey, didn't you promise
to teach me how to play pool?

48
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,449
No dessert?

49
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,867
Dad... I'm going out
for a bit.

50
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:08,388
It's very hot.

51
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:11,341
Be very careful, dear.

52
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,926
This neighborhood is full
of potheads now.

53
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,141
Yes, sir.

54
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,584
Nice! It's good.

55
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,062
You're learning.

56
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,095
Of course, with such an awesome
teacher, how could I not?

57
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,918
- Really?
- Yeah.

58
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:43,978
You like it? Yeah?

59
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,579
I spoke with Fabiola.

60
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:52,426
What's that tramp
telling you now?

61
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,217
She said she can get us in.

62
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:57,774
Come on.

63
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,050
You know that's all bullshit.

64
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,934
Aren't we supposed to go
to the embassy first?

65
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:05,204
You know,
fill out some forms,

66
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,695
go here, there,
do this and that?

67
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,485
Yes, but they are never going
to give us a visa.

68
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:13,172
Or at least not to me.

69
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:16,056
It doesn't hurt to try.

70
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:20,346
I'll ask you the same questions
Fabiola asked me.

71
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:23,292
Do you have a credit card?

72
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:24,699
Do you have a bank account?

73
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,740
- No.
- Do you have a steady job?

74
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,569
- No.
- What about property?

75
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:33,372
- A house? A car?
- No... I don't! I wish!

76
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,838
An uncle in the government,
secretary of any darn thing?

77
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,457
I wish I did!

78
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,081
See? You have nothing.

79
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:44,929
With nothing,
they won't give you a visa.

80
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,033
No, but I have you.

81
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,652
But having me
won't get you a visa.

82
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,422
But why New York?

83
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,663
Why so far away?

84
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,635
Because that's where it's at.

85
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:18,281
Look at the pictures my cousin
Gloria sent me.

86
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:22,055
She says we can
stay with her if we want to.

87
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,698
Come here...

88
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,142
Where were you hiding
those pictures?

89
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:48,488
Keep your hands to yourself
and sit down, would you?

90
00:10:54,385 --> 00:11:00,082
Can you imagine me and you
living in a little apartment...

91
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:06,410
with a big tub we can get into
every night and make love?

92
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,785
Why don't we start now?

93
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:14,162
You know all this is yours...

94
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,985
but once we get there.

95
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,361
But why?

96
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,437
Let's go slowly.

97
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,510
No... let's come slowly.

98
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,333
I'd better get home.

99
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,057
But we were
just getting started.

100
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,422
That's just the point.

101
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,640
Hey, Giovanny, a thief!
Grab him, grab him!

102
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,292
Get him,
throw him out of here!

103
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:04,184
Get that rat out of here!

104
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:08,562
I don't allow thieves
in here; kick him out!

105
00:14:08,669 --> 00:14:10,643
Wait, hold on!

106
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,570
Out!

107
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,286
Let go!

108
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,895
Come inside, Giovanny.

109
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,764
I'm not a thief!

110
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,135
There she is...

111
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:08,160
- Hi.
- What's up man.

112
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,710
Look.

113
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,845
Look how pretty
it is there when it snows.

114
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:19,722
Rather than that fucking mud pit
we get here every time it rains.

115
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,892
You should stop
looking at those pictures.

116
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:25,127
Oh, relax, just calm down.

117
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm perfectly calm.

118
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,885
No, no, don't worry about them,
just give them to me; thank you.

119
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,358
Well, well.

120
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:35,461
I have the vouchers
and the passports

121
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,186
with visas for Guatemala
for those who paid.

122
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,677
The group is leaving
on the scheduled date

123
00:15:40,784 --> 00:15:42,345
with those who've paid.

124
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:45,318
Those who haven't will have to
wait until we plan another trip.

125
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:46,766
But when
does this group leave?

126
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,557
No "buts," we're serious
people here,

127
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,546
and what
we say is what we do.

128
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:54,255
The tickets include the flights
from Medellin to Panama

129
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:56,461
and from Panama to Guatemala.

130
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,930
In Guatemala,
if anybody asks,

131
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:03,022
you just say you're there
for a week's vacation.

132
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,980
You shouldn't need
to make up anything else.

133
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,762
There, you will be greeted
by our representative

134
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:10,384
and once you get
settled at the resort,

135
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:13,871
he'll explain how you'll take
the fluvial route to Mexico.

136
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:16,627
From there,
a first-class surface transport

137
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:18,703
will take you to the border.

138
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,460
From there it's a hop,
skip, and a jump

139
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,797
and then you'll
start seeing signs saying:

140
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:27,924
"Welcome to the United States."

141
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:30,810
Excuse me, one question:
"fluvial, " what is that?

142
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,731
Fluvial! By river!
By river!

143
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:34,257
Ah, Okay...

144
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:37,660
And now, one little tip
for when you're there.

145
00:16:37,757 --> 00:16:39,895
There, my dears,

146
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:43,959
anybody wearing a uniform
is an official of some sort,

147
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:45,785
and remember... the last
thing you people need

148
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:50,077
is any kind
of official for anything.

149
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:52,412
So, when you're there and you
see some guy in a uniform,

150
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:57,118
and he's coming towards you, you
walk in the opposite direction.

151
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:58,973
Do you understand?

152
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:04,126
Now, it's $3,000, per person,
"by next week."

153
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:07,162
If not,
"So sorry, babies, no fly."

154
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,156
All right, questions?

155
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:10,778
Damn it, Marlon,

156
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:13,819
we have to figure out a way
to get that money somehow.

157
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,544
- That's a lot of money, Reina.
- So?

158
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:19,516
We'll never come up
with that kind of money.

159
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,012
There's only three ways to raise
that kind of money:

160
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,854
working, gambling, or stealing.

161
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,928
Here you go, sweetheart,
Miguel Correa?

162
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,309
Right here!

163
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:32,678
Here you are... black, black
like you're wearing now, yes.

164
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:35,112
Cristina Beltran,
here you go.

165
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,420
Please, dad,
give me that job.

166
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:38,016
I know this city better
than you do.

167
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,545
I'm going
to tell you something.

168
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:42,176
Everything I've done
in my life has been

169
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:44,519
so that you can get a good
education and build a career.

170
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,791
Not so you can drive
a taxi.

171
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:48,681
But wasn't
that how you started?

172
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,026
And now you've got
four taxis.

173
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,881
Look how well you're doing.

174
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,316
That was different, son,
I started at the bottom.

175
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,618
But for you it's different,
thanks to what I've done.

176
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:59,850
Now it's time for you
to go to the University.

177
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:03,662
Mateo, sit up straight,
like I told you.

178
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,378
Don't you
want to go to college, Marlon?

179
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,001
You know, our contact there
is making some progress.

180
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:10,894
They told me
just the other day,

181
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,520
when the strike
is over, you can start.

182
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,902
That's just it, Mom.

183
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,858
In the meantime,
I'd like to earn a few pesos.

184
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,573
- Marlon, I said no!
- Why not?

185
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,682
How come Juancho's
family gave him work?

186
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,763
That's Juancho's family,
not this one!

187
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,112
Do you know
how many of my drivers

188
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:25,774
have been mugged
this week?

189
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,366
- Mom told you to say that!
- Nobody has told me anything.

190
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,574
Besides, I don't have
any free taxis,

191
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,402
they're all
working double shift..

192
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:35,600
I don't want to talk about this
again, understood?

193
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:38,125
Mateo, pick up your spoon
and eat properly.

194
00:19:00,476 --> 00:19:02,134
You're hungry, aren't you?

195
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:06,838
You know you just can't enter
a place like a madman

196
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:09,626
and steal food
without permission.

197
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,550
Are you Colombian?

198
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,754
Colombian just like you.

199
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,566
Giovanny, go and see if you can
find something for a fever.

200
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,699
But ma'am, didn't you see
he was trying to steal food?

201
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:26,842
Go on, look at him,
what harm can he do to me?

202
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:31,487
He barely has enough strength
to lift up the spoon.

203
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,522
Where have you been
that you smell so bad?

204
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:35,970
- I got lost.
- Patricia!

205
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:39,964
Do you think we're in a position
to feed everyone in this city?

206
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,760
Pastor, stop nagging.

207
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,644
This boy is sick, and look
how cold it is out here.

208
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:46,882
help me
get him into the basement.

209
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,439
Help you? What nerve!

210
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:52,577
You fag! I told you I don't want
to see you anywhere around here.

211
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,338
All right, come with me, son.

212
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,402
Come on... come on,
finish it inside.

213
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,480
Patricia, this is the last
time I'll tell you!

214
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:04,744
This bum is not setting foot in
my restaurant! That's final!

215
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,173
Sit down here.

216
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:24,165
You know,
you got a pretty face, kid.

217
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:26,573
- Here you go, Patricia.
- Thank you.

218
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,264
- I'll bring some water.
- Yeah, okay.

219
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,736
And bring some blankets
so we can cover up this boy.

220
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,150
- Okay.
- Ma'am, is this "Queen"?

221
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:36,843
Yes, this is Jackson Heights,
Queens.

222
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,815
- Here you go.
- Thank you, son.

223
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:43,371
So Reina should be here,
nearby.

224
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,490
Reina...

225
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,148
On the front of Reina's hostel
it says "Queen."

226
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,587
"Queen" or "Queens?"'

227
00:20:58,294 --> 00:21:00,978
Like Reina, but in English.

228
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,276
- I have to go.
- No, lay down, get some rest,

229
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:07,442
try to sleep.

230
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,268
Do you have any idea
how many hostels

231
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,705
there are in Queens?

232
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,249
Lock it.

233
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:00,512
- What?
- Lock the damn door, you idiot!

234
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,075
What are you doing?

235
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,643
You shouldn't
be going through that.

236
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,058
I wasn't going through anything.

237
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,711
I found it by accident.

238
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:10,236
Hey, nobody opens
a suitcase by accident.

239
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,212
Put it back!
Do you think I'm stupid?

240
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,827
Reina, don't you dare,

241
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:23,074
that money
belongs to the German.

242
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:26,440
Please, just put it back
in the suitcase.

243
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:27,945
Don't you like to play?

244
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,312
Reina, Reina, please...

245
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,801
just put back that money.

246
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:43,588
- Reina, give it back.
- Take it.

247
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,973
You're going to give me
the money, aren't you?

248
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,512
They caught us! Hurry!

249
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:55,111
All right!

250
00:22:55,216 --> 00:22:59,526
- Who is in there? Let me in.
- Give me that money, please.

251
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:04,686
Reina, please...

252
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,161
We got locked in by accident.

253
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:09,227
Some kind of accident!

254
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,698
You're sweating, you devil!

255
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:15,343
I want to show the pictures
of the Cayman lslands...

256
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,907
to all those
jealous old bitches,

257
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,534
who used to give me shit about
being single at my age.

258
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:23,415
Move! You're in my way,
and stop shaking... move!

259
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,933
What's wrong with you?

260
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,204
You have no idea what it's like
to be coming up with excuses

261
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:32,688
for the last 35 years
to go to the gynecologist.

262
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:37,550
Waxings twice a week, with them
breathing down my neck.

263
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:41,271
Look at where he's
taking me for our honeymoon.

264
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,924
I guess he doesn't
wanna know.

265
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:47,991
He's a bum and he's here to live
off the hard work of others.

266
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,848
Well, I'm sorry but he's staying
for a few days.

267
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,543
I'm not going to allow that,
I'm going to call the cops.

268
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,369
Oh, you're going
to call the cops?

269
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:54,995
- What are you talking about?
- Come on!

270
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,273
Get him out of here, I don't
want that bum in my house!

271
00:23:57,374 --> 00:23:58,835
Leave it alone, Pastor!

272
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:00,437
- I want him out of here!
- Careful with the phone!

273
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,161
Don't be such a grouch!

274
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:06,198
Just for the record,
I warned you!

275
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:10,167
Don't complain
to me about it later.

276
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:18,425
Freaking fag... I'm trying
to run a restaurant here.

277
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:23,682
Good morning, son,
did you get any sleep?

278
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,691
These will be kind of big
on you,

279
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,831
but this
is all I could find.

280
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,683
Now go get washed,
you're smelling really bad.

281
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:34,368
Ma'am?

282
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,063
I don't want
to bother you anymore,

283
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,078
but I have to ask you for
a huge favor.

284
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,640
What favor?

285
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,527
- I have to call home.
- Colombia?

286
00:24:43,624 --> 00:24:46,375
Reina probably already called
to say where she is.

287
00:24:46,473 --> 00:24:48,840
We'll have to see, Marlon.

288
00:24:48,938 --> 00:24:51,458
You know those long distance
calls are very expensive.

289
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:54,911
Please, ma'am,
just that one favor.

290
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,276
Get yourself cleaned up first,
I'll see what I can do.

291
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,398
Hello.

292
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,763
Mom?

293
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:45,771
- Hello?
- Excuse me, Miss Patricia

294
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,285
- Get out!
- Hello, mom!

295
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:50,679
Marlon? It's Marlon!

296
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:53,907
My darling, where are you?
Are you okay?

297
00:25:54,008 --> 00:25:55,699
I got to New York, I'm okay.

298
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,209
Marlon, you get back here
this instant! Where are?

299
00:26:00,314 --> 00:26:03,315
Dad... It's good
to hear your voice.

300
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,353
How could you do this to us,
you are a crook!

301
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,314
You have no idea the pain
you've caused your mother

302
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:12,089
- and aunt Marlene!
- I'm so sorry, Dad...

303
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:14,458
and I hope aunt Marlene
will forgive me,

304
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:15,767
but it was
something I had to do.

305
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,211
What do you mean something
you had to do?

306
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,651
Is that what we taught you?

307
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,637
Get back here and face
what you've done!

308
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:23,515
Marlon, we've got that
German living in this house

309
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:26,003
until you get back and
give him the money.

310
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,761
Please come back, please
come back, I'm begging you!

311
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:30,425
Has Reina called you
there yet, Mom?

312
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,732
Reina? Are you kidding me?
That thief!

313
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,972
Dad, don't call her that, Dad.

314
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:36,863
What do you want
me to call her then?

315
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,848
You get
your ass back here

316
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,360
All right, come with me
son, tell me what happened.

317
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,889
Come on, let's go.

318
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:51,930
Then we arrived at a small town
in Texas.

319
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:54,141
I can't remember the name.

320
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:59,712
With the money that Reina had,
we were able to catch a bus...

321
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:03,645
that took 5 days
to bring us here.

322
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,021
And you have no money left?

323
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,713
No.

324
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:11,199
Well, it's a miracle
you're still alive.

325
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,535
What do you do here when you're
trying to find someone

326
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,128
who's lost?

327
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,892
Well, usually
you start with the hospitals,

328
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,717
the morgue, the police,

329
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:22,022
but that wouldn't work
in this case.

330
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:28,323
You need to get yourself settled
and you need to find a job.

331
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,211
Where do I start?

332
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:33,131
For now,
just start with breakfast

333
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,579
because you're going to need
to get back all your strength.

334
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:39,077
Good moming!

335
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,971
I just need
to use the restroom.

336
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,895
Go ahead.

337
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,755
Shit!

338
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,102
That's the final straw!

339
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:52,104
How dare you give him
my clothes! Giovanny!

340
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,691
Stop making such a fuss,
for God's sake.

341
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,064
Have you forgotten
what it's like to come here

342
00:27:58,164 --> 00:27:59,343
and nobody helps you?

343
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:00,970
No, I haven't forgotten, I know
what you have to do.

344
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,760
You have to work,
like you did, like I did.

345
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,422
- Giovanny!
- Yes, sir!

346
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,533
Take this bum to the wall,

347
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,580
so he'll leam to work freezing
his ass off!

348
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,312
He's going to sleep
in the basement.

349
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:12,591
What?

350
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:15,411
He's not sleeping outside!
You hear me?

351
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:18,577
Go on, get this fag out of here,
or you'll have to answer to me!

352
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,030
What wall
is he talking about?

353
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,172
The only thing I want to do
is find my girlfriend.

354
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,544
Did you come
from here or there?

355
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:34,938
How could I possibly
remember that?

356
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,556
Everything looks the same here.

357
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:42,296
Come on.

358
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:51,321
Okay, man,
we've got to figure this out.

359
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:52,764
Tell me, more or less,

360
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:57,174
how far did you walk before you
got to this place right here?

361
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,039
- I didn't walk.
- Okay, how far did you run?

362
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:04,602
I don't know.

363
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:07,838
Listen, Marlon,
Patricia said you needed help.

364
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:10,907
The problem is that things
are different here.

365
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:13,281
Reina doesn't exist as far
as the Americans are concerned.

366
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,787
So we've got to have
something,

367
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,990
a photograph to put
on a poster for people to see,

368
00:29:17,094 --> 00:29:19,581
a telephone number,
or something, you understand?

369
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,555
I didn't bring
pictures or anything.

370
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:24,320
But she's really easy
to recognize

371
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:26,943
because she's got one
brown eye and one green.

372
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:31,011
People notice those kinds
of things.

373
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,284
We should just ask around.

374
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,425
No, no, no, you don't
understand,

375
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,247
that's not how it works...
this here is not Colombia.

376
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:39,719
This is New York.

377
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:42,185
Come with me,
I'm going to show you something.

378
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,605
Take a good look.

379
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,556
This is the monster
you'll have to tame.

380
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,058
You think you can find somebody
in this mess,

381
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:53,899
when your only clue
is a sign that says "Queen, "

382
00:29:53,997 --> 00:29:57,161
or that she has a green
or blue eye? No, man,

383
00:29:57,261 --> 00:30:00,394
your Reina will turn up if she's
got somebody looking for her,

384
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:03,213
but it'll take time,
you've got to start the process.

385
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:05,767
- What process?
- The process...

386
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:09,353
get your papers, social
security, start paying taxes.

387
00:30:09,457 --> 00:30:12,272
That's the only way you can
become legal in this country.

388
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:14,736
Or marry an American.

389
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,043
What are you talking about?

390
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:18,087
Listen Marlon, I know everything
looks bleak right now,

391
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,616
but the day you start sending
money home to your family,

392
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,862
everything changes for you.

393
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,752
And that first remittance,
it's the most gratifying moment

394
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,380
for an immigrant.

395
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:34,637
No... that's not why I came.

396
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:36,782
That's not my case.

397
00:30:42,168 --> 00:30:43,989
What does it say there?

398
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:54,040
Paradise awaits you.

399
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,402
What would that be like...

400
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,585
Here we are.

401
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:30,846
This is the wall Pastor
was talking about.

402
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,500
What are they doing there?

403
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:36,255
They're looking for work.

404
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,409
What kind of work?

405
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:42,436
Whatever there is.

406
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,705
Whatever the Americans
don't want to do.

407
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:47,741
Bricklaying,
construction, gardening...

408
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:49,407
The pay is low, but there's
no choice.

409
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,072
You make enough
to eat and sleep.

410
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,077
It's not ideal but it's work
and it's an opportunity.

411
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:55,590
In a while
you'll find something better,

412
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,055
and you'll see someone else
arrive and take your place.

413
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:00,869
In this country you've got
to stand in line for everything,

414
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:03,870
even to be happy.

415
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,677
Put it down.

416
00:33:39,006 --> 00:33:41,243
Excuse me, excuse me.

417
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:45,020
- Reina.
- What happened?

418
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,344
Wait... are you sure about
going through with this?

419
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,165
Why, you're not?

420
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,471
You can still back out
if you want to.

421
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,419
Excuse me, could you keep
moving this way, please?

422
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:58,337
Come on,
you're holding up the line!

423
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:02,080
Don't grab me like that!
You know I hate it.

424
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,566
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this is Aerocol flight # 3833.

425
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,611
Our final destination
is Panama City.

426
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,343
For safety reasons,
we request you to please

427
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:11,486
fasten your seatbelts and
refrain from smoking

428
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,377
during the whole flight.

429
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:14,973
This flight will
take 1 hour

430
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:17,413
You don't
look so nervous now.

431
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:20,861
Just put your seatbelt on,
would you.

432
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:36,066
I think we left.

433
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:46,918
Marlon.

434
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,110
I know these have been very
difficult days for you,

435
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,906
but Pastor finally gave in.

436
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,251
He gave in?

437
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,489
We're giving you a job,
here in the restaurant.

438
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:59,014
I'll do anything rather than
lifting those sacks.

439
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,324
You can't keep
sleeping here, though.

440
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:04,491
That was his condition.

441
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:07,245
But... ma'am.

442
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:09,713
Where am I supposed to sleep
if I don't know anyone here?

443
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,185
I'm working on that.

444
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,908
But for now,
you'll start working here,

445
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:15,378
that's the most important thing.

446
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:18,476
Okay, where do you
want me to start?

447
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:22,737
Here, brother,
your new office.

448
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:25,325
Welcome!

449
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:28,277
Clean the mirrors, the sinks,
take out the garbage.

450
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,546
It's important to clean
after every single customer

451
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:32,851
that comes in.

452
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:35,822
I'm going to spend all my time
cleaning shit.

453
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:39,029
When am I supposed to look
for my girlfriend, Giovanny?

454
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,333
You gotta to stop talking
like that, man.

455
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,093
You have to
focus on working here now.

456
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:46,064
You think everybody who comes
here gets a job this easily?

457
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:49,586
Forget that nonsense and take
advantage of this opportunity.

458
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,040
What, is this to hold onto
when you have to push too hard?

459
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:55,930
What a stupid ass.

460
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:59,291
That's for
the "handicapped," Marlon.

461
00:35:59,388 --> 00:36:02,488
"Handicapped"?

462
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,413
Enjoy!

463
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:17,244
Marlon, come on, hurry up,
they're here to pick you up.

464
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:25,631
Look son... this is Mr. Hernan.

465
00:36:25,731 --> 00:36:28,993
He's very nice, he's always
helping in the community,

466
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,482
and he's found you
a place to sleep for free

467
00:36:31,588 --> 00:36:32,832
until you save
a little money.

468
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,527
Hernan Posada,
at your service.

469
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,321
Pleased to meet you.

470
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:39,718
Free? Forgive me, Mr. Hernan,

471
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:41,442
That sounds
too good to be true.

472
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:46,147
Oh, relax, Marlon, I would trust
my life to Mr. Hernan.

473
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:48,518
Anyway, what other
choice do you have?

474
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:51,367
How about we take a walk
and you tell me what happened.

475
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:52,839
Thank you so much,
Mr. Hernan.

476
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:55,044
- You're welcome.
- You take care of yourself.

477
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,553
See you tomorrow,
Miss Patricia.

478
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,895
See you tomorrow.

479
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,482
I know
many cases like yours.

480
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:11,174
If there's any way
I can help you...

481
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:14,345
any questions you might have,
just let me know.

482
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,618
How do I get rid of the fear?

483
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,923
It's a matter of time.

484
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:24,523
We immigrants carry fear
and uncertainty inside.

485
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,244
We think there's
always someone coming after us.

486
00:37:40,244 --> 00:37:43,922
People that have been through
downtown, also politicians

487
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,989
Hey, my sweetie pie!

488
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:50,159
You haven't been here
for so long.

489
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:53,941
Look at
the present you brought me!

490
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,448
Oh, what a pretty
little pumpkin.

491
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:02,001
Be nice to the boy,
he's had a rough time.

492
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:05,040
Make sure
he's well taken care of.

493
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:07,796
Of course I will.

494
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:11,828
Look, my love,
don't you worry.

495
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:16,056
Nothing will happen
to you here.

496
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,644
He's afraid.

497
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:20,604
Right? Don't take him
away so fast.

498
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,938
Her name is Raquel,
she had to come here

499
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:25,755
when she abandoned
her family because of alcohol.

500
00:38:25,854 --> 00:38:29,913
She's spent a lot of time
on the streets... she's sick.

501
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,062
Don't let her bother you.

502
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,588
It's taken a lot
of time to rehabilitate her,

503
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:35,768
but she's a good person.

504
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:41,624
I don't know what Patricia told
you about me, Mr. Hernan...

505
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:43,902
but I'm not
like any of these people,

506
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,977
I don't have a drug
or alcohol problem.

507
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:48,449
I know, son, but there aren't
many places in this city

508
00:38:48,547 --> 00:38:50,620
where you could
stay without paying.

509
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:53,724
Besides, nobody is going
to bite you here.

510
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:59,001
What, what, what...

511
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:12,591
Welcome, travelers.

512
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:14,930
I hope
you had a good trip.

513
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:19,341
It's very important that you
pay for your rooms now,

514
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,782
there won't be time
to take care of it tomorrow

515
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,563
because we have to leave
very early in the morning.

516
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:26,071
It's $30 per person.

517
00:40:26,168 --> 00:40:29,518
- $30 bucks for this dump?
- No, no, no way!

518
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:33,238
Excuse me, but this was
supposed to be included.

519
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:36,089
They didn't tell us we needed
to bring more money.

520
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:39,668
Why would you pay there
for what you will use here?

521
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:43,515
You're here...
the resort is here.

522
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,652
Did you really think
you could pay there

523
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:47,611
for what you
have to pay here?

524
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:50,775
You're gonna have to work
that out with Fabiola

525
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:52,472
back in Medellin,
we have no money.

526
00:40:52,574 --> 00:40:53,720
Yeah, come on, man,
we already paid for that!

527
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:55,862
So where are you planning
to sleep tonight?

528
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,690
What do you mean, where are we
supposed to sleep? Here, man!

529
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:01,917
I have very few beds;
first come, first served.

530
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:08,030
Okay, I'll pay you, that's for
two, all right?

531
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:13,401
- Take it, sorry bastard.
- Here, give me my change.

532
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,809
There are three of you,
ma'am.

533
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:24,547
I'll pay you back
in The States, man, come on.

534
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:47,012
Stop pushing!

535
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:49,799
Move, that one
over there's mine.

536
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:52,485
I got this one, over here,
over here.

537
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:54,476
This one over here is mine.

538
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:58,403
If there's not enough beds,
there's always the floor.

539
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:05,861
* I look up to the sky *

540
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:11,336
* searching for a little
of my life *

541
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:16,363
* My stars don't answer me *

542
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:21,518
* to show the way
to your smile *

543
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:26,769
* Waves that shade my eyes *

544
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:32,051
* a league away
from your memories *

545
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,201
* steal pictures of
your face *

546
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:40,979
* leaving sand in the silence *

547
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,131
* I'm searching for you
lost among dreams *

548
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:51,350
* The noise of people
around me wraps me in a veil *

549
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:56,206
* I'm searching for you
flying through the sky *

550
00:42:56,314 --> 00:43:02,577
* the wind has carried you away
like an old handkerchief *

551
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:07,802
* I do nothing else
but search and search *

552
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,083
* through familiar landscapes *

553
00:43:13,182 --> 00:43:16,925
* in places so strange *

554
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:23,417
* that I'll never
find you *

555
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:31,094
Are you sure, Mom?

556
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:34,847
Were you able
to talk to Mr. Gonzalo?

557
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,329
Marlon, he's not okay
with all of this.

558
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:40,989
First it's the wife, now
the daughter, he's very upset.

559
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:45,119
What should I do then? Tell me,
she couldn't have just vanished.

560
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:47,010
No one knows anything here.

561
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:49,379
Everyone thinks
she's with you, Marlon.

562
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:52,097
Why don't you just come back
here to your family

563
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:55,014
and forget about her?

564
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:59,006
Is Dad still so mad
he won't even talk to me?

565
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:01,829
You know him,
what can I do, Marlon?

566
00:44:01,928 --> 00:44:04,546
He's still very hurt,
you did something very bad

567
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:07,878
- Mom, your blessing-
- God bless you, son,

568
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,669
please, don't stay over there,
come back quickly.

569
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:11,199
Okay, bye.

570
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:18,503
- Hi.
- Hi.

571
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:21,539
- How's it going?
- Fine.

572
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:25,093
I didn't know you sang...

573
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,020
Well, now you do.

574
00:44:27,117 --> 00:44:30,600
- How did the band sound?
- What band?

575
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:35,243
You mean
those two little funny guys?

576
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:37,319
Yup, they're my band.

577
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,075
Yeah, they sounded good.

578
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:42,543
That's because we're
the best band in Queens.

579
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:45,391
The only problem is you
made a mistake in the lyrics.

580
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:46,603
Oh, really? What's that?

581
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:50,383
You said "l steal pictures
of your face,

582
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:51,913
crying alone in the silence."

583
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:54,387
It's "They steal shapes
from your face, "

584
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,207
Ieaving sand in the silence."

585
00:44:56,307 --> 00:45:00,401
It's not a mistake, actually, it
makes it easier to understand.

586
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,738
What? Are you some kind
of music purist or something,

587
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,653
that you get offended if someone
changes the lyrics?

588
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,434
No, I just know that song.

589
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:12,912
I don't know why but we
always find songs that remind us

590
00:45:13,017 --> 00:45:16,083
of what we're feeling or
experiencing in life,

591
00:45:16,185 --> 00:45:18,902
So that means you're searching.

592
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:21,423
We're all searching for
something, aren't we?

593
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,914
Or in your case, someone.

594
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,425
How do you know?

595
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:29,939
There's no secrets
in the restaurant.

596
00:45:30,045 --> 00:45:32,379
I hate these stupid ghosts!

597
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:34,485
Nice to meet you.

598
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:37,011
- What's your name?
- Milagros, Milagros Valdez.

599
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:39,354
I'm Marlon Cruz.

600
00:45:39,454 --> 00:45:41,626
I'm taking the subway,
are you coming?

601
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:45,022
Yeah, hold on,
I have to get my clothes.

602
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:58,717
- Yes, Reina, yes.
- So you're horny.

603
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:02,364
Let me take care of that.

604
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:07,806
Fuck me...

605
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:13,317
I'm much more woman
than she is.

606
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:14,876
What? What's going on?

607
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:17,404
Get off! Get off!
You dirty bitch!

608
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,544
Fuck her!

609
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:29,733
Come here.

610
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:49,578
Rio Suchiate
Guatemala/Mexico Border

611
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,500
Come on,
the kid's next.

612
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:53,290
- The kid will be fine, move!
- Mom!

613
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:55,912
Shut that fucking kid up.

614
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,323
Come on,
get over here!

615
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:59,846
You think I'm gonna get wet for
a dumbass who's so scared.

616
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:02,408
If you can't cross by yourself
you'll have to stay behind!

617
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:04,968
This stupid boy is
going to makes us all fall.

618
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,599
Where are you going?

619
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:08,429
- The boy!
- Just leave him!

620
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,880
I'm gonna get the boy!

621
00:47:11,987 --> 00:47:15,283
- Come here.
- Let go of him.

622
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:18,697
I'll take him.

623
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:31,222
If he makes another sound,
I'm cutting the rope, asshole.

624
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:57,366
On your knees!

625
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,396
Give me your tennis shoes,
asshole!

626
00:48:14,496 --> 00:48:17,432
How could l
give you my tennis shoes?!

627
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:50,304
How come she hasn't called you?
You're her father.

628
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:52,864
I know, I know.

629
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:56,099
Can you speak up?
This call is expensive.

630
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,465
- What happened?
- The same old shit.

631
00:49:03,563 --> 00:49:06,281
That old man
is crazier than a goat!

632
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:10,407
To top it all, I don't have
a place to sleep tonight.

633
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:12,297
Come on, back to work.

634
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:14,788
Hey, Milagros,
how're you doing?

635
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:16,104
This poor guy doesn't have
anywhere to sleep.

636
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,701
Maybe he can stay with you.

637
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:20,142
As long as he doesn't snore.

638
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,721
Ehh... no... I'm sorry.

639
00:49:23,824 --> 00:49:26,858
That Giovanny.

640
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:30,955
- Hey, thanks for nothing, man.
- You're welcome.

641
00:49:31,057 --> 00:49:35,182
Hey, kid, come here.

642
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:41,423
Mr. Hernan,
how are you?

643
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:43,696
What's up? What happened
to you last night?

644
00:49:43,796 --> 00:49:49,426
Nothing, it's just
I had to run out of there.

645
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:53,617
I've already heard, that woman
is incredible! Have a seat.

646
00:49:53,718 --> 00:49:55,475
Giovanny!

647
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,446
I found another place
for you, kid.

648
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:01,488
- Really? You did?
- It's not great, but...

649
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:03,501
But, but what?

650
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:05,038
With what they probably
pay you here,

651
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,316
you can't expect very much.

652
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:10,200
- Hey, Giovanny.
- How's it going, Mr. Heman?

653
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:14,260
I found another place for Marlon
to stay at night.

654
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:17,397
Do you know
where Roger Pena lives?

655
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,988
Roger Pena?

656
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:23,126
Beautiful, my two favorite
boys sitting down;

657
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,782
would you boys like me
to bring you a drink?

658
00:50:25,885 --> 00:50:28,733
Get back to work, you bums!

659
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:30,740
How are you doing,
Pastor?

660
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:32,277
How is it going, my friend.

661
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:33,943
Man, it's cold.

662
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:36,949
Yeah... that's the building.

663
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:38,486
Which one? The cool one?

664
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:40,829
No, the one next to it.

665
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:43,798
That place is a rat hole!

666
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:45,662
It looks abandoned.

667
00:50:45,763 --> 00:50:47,738
It's because It is,
why do you think it's so cheap?

668
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:52,250
People live there without paying
rent, they're squatters.

669
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:58,075
In Colombia
I wasn't rich, Giovanny,

670
00:50:58,182 --> 00:51:02,272
but I wasn't this
poor either, brother.

671
00:51:02,373 --> 00:51:07,590
Here, the rich want to buy,
but the poor don't want to sell.

672
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:12,925
The rich offer too little, and
the poor ask for too much.

673
00:51:25,898 --> 00:51:27,654
Coming, coming.

674
00:51:32,908 --> 00:51:34,819
Welcome, stranger.

675
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,266
Come on in.

676
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:38,787
How're you doing, Roger?

677
00:51:38,894 --> 00:51:41,544
Hanging in there.

678
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:44,582
All right, good,
the big bed is mine.

679
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,475
This one right here,
this is yours.

680
00:51:46,575 --> 00:51:48,614
The bathroom is
down the hall to your left

681
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,997
and the kitchen is in there.

682
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:56,175
You can keep your things here,
under the b-b-b-bed,

683
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:59,755
because the wardrobe
over here, that's mine too.

684
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:01,767
And the other bed?

685
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:03,598
Don't worry about it,
you'll never see him.

686
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:06,383
He works while we sleep.

687
00:52:06,483 --> 00:52:07,825
Just in case,
his name is Javier,

688
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,746
and the guy who sleeps in your
bed while you're at work

689
00:52:09,845 --> 00:52:11,984
is William, and if you're
here at the same time,

690
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:17,486
you'll have
to share the b-b-bed.

691
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:18,702
Are you leaving?

692
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:21,043
- Yes.
- Bye.

693
00:52:28,921 --> 00:52:31,376
Hey, take this, kid!

694
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:35,956
Don't lose them, or I'll have to
ch-ch-charge you for a copy.

695
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:37,782
Speaking of ch-ch-ch-ch...

696
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:40,403
Charging?

697
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:44,763
Listen, Roger,
he just got here.

698
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,038
So what?

699
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,964
Do you think you could maybe
give him 'til next week

700
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,687
when he gets paid?

701
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:52,375
I guarantee you,
he's good for it, man.

702
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:54,714
I'm not worried, you know why?

703
00:52:54,815 --> 00:53:00,926
Because here, everyone pays
one way-ay-ay or another.

704
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,725
Hey, Giovanny...

705
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,589
I'm gonna have to share
my bed with a stranger.

706
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:08,544
And look how crazy this guy is.

707
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,358
Relax, nothing
is going to happen to you.

708
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,453
All right, Roger, thanks again
for everything.

709
00:53:15,555 --> 00:53:18,589
See you tomorrow.

710
00:53:18,691 --> 00:53:22,751
Beware, boy, lights out
at 10:00 P.M. sharp.

711
00:53:22,852 --> 00:53:25,722
How long
are you planning to stay?

712
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:29,473
Truth is, not that long.

713
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,607
I'm looking for my girlfriend,
and when I find her, I'll leave.

714
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,981
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

715
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,625
We got lost from each other,
I'm looking for her.

716
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:42,078
Here in New York? Right.

717
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:47,969
Hey, look!
That bag just moved.

718
00:53:48,073 --> 00:53:52,352
Damn right, it did...
that's D-D-D-Demon.

719
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,689
- Demon?
- Yes, like the devil.

720
00:53:55,787 --> 00:53:58,471
Why did you name it that?

721
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:01,191
Because he's a son
of a b-b-b-bitch.

722
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:02,820
- Does he bite?
- Of course he bites.

723
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:07,683
We both do,
when we're f-f-fucked with.

724
00:54:11,054 --> 00:54:12,713
Damn, look at the time,
it's 10:00 already.

725
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:15,946
Good night, boy.

726
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,271
Hey, Mr. Roger?
What's that noise?

727
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:27,950
They're b-b-balls.

728
00:54:32,276 --> 00:54:34,098
Balls?

729
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:00,600
What's going on,
where were you?!

730
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,186
Hurry up, the bus to Reynosa
is almost here!

731
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:05,234
you'll have
many days to sleep there.

732
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:08,121
Hurry up, let's go!

733
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,740
Hurry up,
let's go, ma'am.

734
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,950
What's your problem, lady...

735
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:56,989
That suitcase was
in my spot.

736
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:59,037
That's what you think.

737
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:03,487
The spot is mine,
it goes with my seat.

738
00:56:03,592 --> 00:56:06,440
Oh, really? Since when
are the seats numbered?

739
00:56:06,536 --> 00:56:08,359
I don't mind throwing suitcases
around this whole trip.

740
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:11,621
Excuse me ma'am,
but we were here first.

741
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:13,959
But your bag was
in my place.

742
00:56:14,058 --> 00:56:16,327
Why don't you go kill yourself,
lndian bitch!

743
00:56:16,427 --> 00:56:17,474
You have to respect me!

744
00:56:20,075 --> 00:56:21,319
Hey settle down!

745
00:56:27,372 --> 00:56:31,019
What the hell
is going on back there?

746
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:33,933
God almighty...

747
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,998
Come here you two, and you,
and you, and all the tourists.

748
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:39,918
Why don't you
control your woman.

749
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:41,227
Mind your own business, asshole.

750
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:43,533
Damned, I have to treat them
like donkeys!

751
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:44,811
Let's relax!

752
00:56:44,914 --> 00:56:48,045
Cut it out!
Mind your business!

753
00:56:48,146 --> 00:56:49,357
Move, now!

754
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:50,800
Why the fuck don't you
stop arguing!

755
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:53,168
Shut up, why don't you
stand up for me, you asshole!

756
00:56:53,267 --> 00:56:55,505
Come on, baby, now!

757
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:04,043
Let's go, kid, I have to treat
them like fucking donkeys!

758
00:57:04,149 --> 00:57:08,340
All right,
enjoying your vacation?

759
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:13,457
The federal police
are tough fuckers...

760
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,763
because I suppose you all have
your papers in order, don't you?

761
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:18,580
Yes, sir.

762
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:21,015
And you, you better
keep it down, all right?

763
00:57:21,113 --> 00:57:24,277
Listen, we have nothing to do
with this problem,

764
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:25,905
- it's that loudmouth.
- Loudmouth?

765
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:28,859
- That lndian started it!
- That may be, sweetheart,

766
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:30,482
but there are several ways
of solving problems.

767
00:57:30,587 --> 00:57:32,410
Oh, really,
the way you solved them?

768
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:34,297
I could stand out here watching
you two fight all day.

769
00:57:34,396 --> 00:57:36,885
You look gorgeous.

770
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:39,988
But the Federal agents will get
suspicious if they see this bus

771
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:42,996
sitting here too long,
so we have to get going.

772
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:45,436
To do that, I'll need a little
cash for some gas, you get me?

773
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:49,429
- let's go.
- I can't believe this!

774
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:53,693
It's too bad, we have
nothing left.

775
00:57:53,793 --> 00:57:55,680
They took everything from us.

776
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:59,607
Everything? They couldn't have
taken... everything.

777
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:02,365
Hey, cut it out.

778
00:58:02,466 --> 00:58:06,842
Look, we're completely broke,
what do you expect us to do?

779
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:12,585
No problem...
you can all stay here.

780
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:14,383
- See you.
- Come on, man,

781
00:58:14,483 --> 00:58:16,239
how are you gonna
leave us here alone

782
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:18,826
Let's give that old fag
what he wants.

783
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:22,924
Or are you honey gonna carry us
all across the border?

784
00:58:23,026 --> 00:58:28,011
Why don't you just
kill yourself, too?

785
00:58:28,113 --> 00:58:31,429
Well, I guess it's up to me to
fix this then, huh?

786
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:34,220
Or you're gonna do it, honey.

787
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,686
Open up!

788
00:58:51,054 --> 00:58:54,729
What is she going to do?

789
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:57,195
I guess she just paid for your
tickets, lucky bastards.

790
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:07,177
* Baby that fish *

791
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:08,519
* I'm not eating it *

792
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:11,466
* I'm not eating it *

793
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:17,442
* I'm not eating that fish
even if it's *

794
00:59:17,545 --> 00:59:19,400
What's up?

795
00:59:19,497 --> 00:59:21,319
Increasing your repertoire?

796
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:27,013
Practicing, so I don't
screw up the lyrics.

797
00:59:27,112 --> 00:59:28,519
You finished?

798
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:30,983
- Yes.
- Okay, wait for me, then,

799
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,592
we'll go together,
where are you going, anyway?

800
00:59:34,694 --> 00:59:36,450
Back to the rat hole.

801
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:38,045
Excuse me,
how much is this?

802
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:41,565
I'm closed, why don't you
come back tomorrow? Thank you.

803
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:48,444
So... do you dance? Or do you
only search?

804
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:50,589
Do I dance, baby?

805
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:53,562
I'll light your feet on fire.

806
01:00:10,656 --> 01:00:13,503
Where's the bathroom?

807
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,389
Give me your jacket.

808
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:22,932
Listen... what kind
of place is this?

809
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:25,332
Guys ask
to dance, girls accept.

810
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:26,640
That's the tradition.

811
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:28,781
Yes... but I just saw them
paying the girls.

812
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,380
Oh, my God,
you've got a dirty mind.

813
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:31,859
Yes, they pay them to dance.

814
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:35,666
$2 a song or $40 an hour.

815
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:36,878
I used
to be a dancer here.

816
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,638
Really, you did?

817
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:40,334
It was either that
or cleaning toilets.

818
01:01:40,436 --> 01:01:43,403
What would you have done?

819
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:38,723
Marlon, what are you up to?

820
01:02:38,828 --> 01:02:41,194
In here,
setting up the franchise.

821
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,902
- What is this?
- Customer service.

822
01:02:45,002 --> 01:02:48,896
Does Pastor know about this?

823
01:02:49,002 --> 01:02:53,922
Anyway, come on, I got you
an appointment with a woman,

824
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:56,196
and she's going
to help us find Reina.

825
01:02:56,297 --> 01:02:57,988
She's the absolute best
at finding lost things,

826
01:02:58,088 --> 01:02:58,982
so come on, let's go.

827
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:01,186
No, Reina's not a thing,
Miss Patricia.

828
01:03:01,289 --> 01:03:03,808
Oh, come on,
if she can find a wallet,

829
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:06,399
why wouldn't she be able
to find Reina? Come on.

830
01:03:06,503 --> 01:03:08,641
Leave that, you'll finish
that later, let's go!

831
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:11,938
- I don't believe in witchcraft.
- Come on.

832
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:23,839
It seems the cards
weren't shuffled properly.

833
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:32,032
She's asking ifyou have
anything of hers.

834
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:45,340
Having something of hers,
it's easier to connect to her.

835
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:50,197
A picture,
a photo, anything.

836
01:03:52,448 --> 01:03:54,488
Are you sure
you don't have anything?

837
01:03:54,593 --> 01:03:58,966
Otherwise, she can't
connect to her.

838
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:09,140
Mary, mother of God, Marlon.

839
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:26,704
She's not lost

840
01:04:26,812 --> 01:04:30,291
and she has the power
of the chameleon in her eyes.

841
01:04:42,552 --> 01:04:46,774
She's not lost
and she's got money,

842
01:04:46,872 --> 01:04:48,596
she's also looking
for someone.

843
01:04:48,697 --> 01:04:51,063
Of course, Miss Patricia,
she's looking for me.

844
01:04:51,159 --> 01:04:55,152
She's finding me,
me, finding me!

845
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:03,154
It's you that's lost.

846
01:05:03,254 --> 01:05:06,483
In order to find her, you've got
to find yourself first.

847
01:05:06,581 --> 01:05:10,510
- That's what she said.
- Ask her when we'll meet again.

848
01:05:16,404 --> 01:05:17,581
What?

849
01:05:17,683 --> 01:05:19,625
How can you charge $60 if you
haven't told me anything?

850
01:05:19,731 --> 01:05:23,146
There are days she can't
see things clearly, Marlon.

851
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:27,079
Hey, take it away from her,
take it away!

852
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:30,797
Calm down, why do you carry that
dirty thing around anyway?

853
01:05:30,897 --> 01:05:33,515
Just be thankful she even
told you that Reina is alive.

854
01:05:33,617 --> 01:05:37,643
But I know she's ok
Ms. Patricia, I know!

855
01:05:37,745 --> 01:05:40,744
How dare you bum
the only thing of hers I have.

856
01:05:45,104 --> 01:05:46,564
She says let her go.

857
01:05:46,671 --> 01:05:48,525
Come on, come on, let's go.

858
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,819
I know she's okay.

859
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:57,859
Yes, be thankful
she told you that.

860
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:04,898
What's next? A massage parlor,
I suppose?

861
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:06,345
Did you know about this?

862
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:08,713
No, but the customers like it,
don't they?

863
01:06:08,812 --> 01:06:11,561
I think it shows great
initiative of Marlon.

864
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,961
It's a service we've never
offered before.

865
01:06:14,058 --> 01:06:15,302
Service?

866
01:06:15,403 --> 01:06:17,190
This is no "service"...

867
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,191
This is a business inside
my business.

868
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:25,120
I just think I should
be able to earn some tips.

869
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:29,480
Maybe... I could even give you
a percentage for rent.

870
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:37,029
Percentage?
What? Like fifty-fifty?

871
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:41,316
My God, Pastor, at your age
you're begging for pennies!

872
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:42,789
- Stop your bullshit!
- Fine!

873
01:06:42,886 --> 01:06:44,348
Let him do whatever
the fuck he wants!

874
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:47,236
No, not whatever the fuck
he wants, he has my permission.

875
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:51,075
Oh, he does? Oh, that's
all he needs, that's enough.

876
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:55,842
- That's right! My permission.
- Fine then, with your permisson!

877
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:58,461
Nice business, bro.

878
01:07:32,063 --> 01:07:34,997
- They thank
any kind of information.

879
01:07:35,103 --> 01:07:37,372
Marlon Cruz is searching
for a young Colombian woman

880
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:42,772
named Reina, 18 years old,
height: 1. 67 m, brown hair

881
01:07:42,878 --> 01:07:45,179
distinctive different color
light eyes.

882
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:49,051
If anyone has any information,
please call us-

883
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:53,208
I have been searching for you
for the past three months.

884
01:07:53,308 --> 01:07:55,282
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know how to-

885
01:07:55,387 --> 01:08:01,137
- named Reina, 18 years old,
she disappeared six months ago.

886
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:04,919
If anyone has any information,
please call us at -

887
01:08:05,018 --> 01:08:10,103
Marlon keeps looking for woman
who disappeared 8 months ago.

888
01:08:10,201 --> 01:08:13,746
Her name is Reina,
she's 18 years old.

889
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:59,983
That's it... m-m-more pain.

890
01:09:00,082 --> 01:09:02,863
Let me feel your pain.

891
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:07,948
Scream with more pain.

892
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:10,120
Come on, let's go,
more agressive,

893
01:09:10,224 --> 01:09:13,933
you know, more agressive,
come on, you're an animal!

894
01:09:14,033 --> 01:09:20,360
No, forget it, it's a failure,
a tragedy.

895
01:09:20,462 --> 01:09:25,764
No, give it up;
don't bother, leave it.

896
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:28,390
So?

897
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,674
See? There we go,
see? It really hurts.

898
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,682
Perfect! Animalistic, just what
I want, just like that!

899
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:41,675
You're gonna
thank me for this.

900
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:43,910
I'm telling you,
it's beautiful.

901
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:47,359
- No, it's not! Let me go!
- Okay, okay, calm down.

902
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:50,597
At least you had
a hard-on, it would help.

903
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:54,211
But with that
tiny package, it's pathetic.

904
01:09:54,313 --> 01:09:57,127
- Let me go already!
- Okay, stop whining.

905
01:10:00,873 --> 01:10:03,141
How dare you whip me,
you asshole!

906
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,768
How dare you not p-p-pay?

907
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:07,425
Are you gonna
let me go or what?

908
01:10:07,528 --> 01:10:09,829
All right, hold your horses,
I'm coming.

909
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:18,042
You're not very good
at hard work, are you?

910
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:21,182
Go get ch-ch-changed,
we're leaving.

911
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:25,599
No way,
I've got things to do.

912
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,675
No, you haven't paid up yet.

913
01:10:27,781 --> 01:10:29,210
What are you
talking about?

914
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:30,810
You think
I was doing you a favor?

915
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:34,079
- That's just a d-d-down payment.
- Down payment my ass!

916
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,092
That's enough.

917
01:10:43,009 --> 01:10:44,123
So where are we going?

918
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:47,128
To see n-n-naked Latinas,
hurry up.

919
01:11:07,999 --> 01:11:11,446
Look at these cows...
Jesus Christ...

920
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:15,705
but for what that
c- c-catalogue is costing.

921
01:11:15,806 --> 01:11:18,871
Roger, don't put me
in that catalogue.

922
01:11:18,972 --> 01:11:25,266
Stop whining,
your face is always c-c-covered.

923
01:11:25,372 --> 01:11:30,128
- Mr. Roger, how's it going?
- What's up, fag?

924
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:32,690
I've got some ladies in the back
ready for your happy ending.

925
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:34,201
Well, the last time
you brought me some

926
01:11:34,299 --> 01:11:37,265
that would make
dogs h-h-h-h-howl.

927
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:39,158
No worries,
these are hot.

928
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:42,106
We'll see, we'll see.

929
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:44,275
No Bro, you stay here.

930
01:11:44,378 --> 01:11:48,152
Well, this goes to all you boys
to the dance floor!

931
01:11:48,249 --> 01:11:49,623
I wanna see you dancing,

932
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,608
because the girls and l
are gonna spank you like rats!

933
01:11:51,705 --> 01:11:54,640
Welcome to "Big Buga!"

934
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:01,102
Calena!

935
01:12:05,045 --> 01:12:08,176
* Hey you
park your truck *

936
01:12:08,277 --> 01:12:11,026
* Your bike also
if you want to *

937
01:12:11,124 --> 01:12:15,150
* I'll be waiting
for you with my doors open *

938
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:18,994
* Biscuit you aren't
good enough *

939
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:26,378
* In case you get naughty
don't you let me down *

940
01:12:26,482 --> 01:12:29,515
* Gimme gimme
sugar cane candy *

941
01:12:29,618 --> 01:12:33,163
What's up?

942
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,891
Hey, sweetheart!

943
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:39,433
What are you doing here
baby?

944
01:12:39,537 --> 01:12:42,024
I didn't recognize you
when you came in.

945
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:43,851
What's happening,
tell me everything,

946
01:12:43,952 --> 01:12:47,629
where's the loudmouth?

947
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:50,957
Calena, right after we got here,
we lost each other.

948
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:53,576
You got lost? Is that so?

949
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,467
Or did "Miss Loudmouth"
give you the boot?

950
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:57,453
You wouldn't believe
all that's happened to me.

951
01:12:57,551 --> 01:13:02,252
I've been doing great, I found
a job as soon as I got here.

952
01:13:02,349 --> 01:13:06,408
So anyway, tell me,
how are things with you?

953
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,002
I'm a delivery boy.

954
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:10,726
What a waste,
you've got to be kidding me.

955
01:13:10,827 --> 01:13:13,162
With your good looks
and being Colombian,

956
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,536
you can do
a lot better than that.

957
01:13:17,642 --> 01:13:20,130
I wasted a lot of time searching
for that girl.

958
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:22,722
But if it's over, why are you
still looking for her?

959
01:13:22,826 --> 01:13:26,721
Why look out there,
when you can find it here?

960
01:13:26,826 --> 01:13:29,509
And it's all free for you.

961
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:34,399
Everything you saw up there,
I've been saving for you.

962
01:13:34,506 --> 01:13:38,660
What's wrong,
are you a faggot?

963
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:44,225
Listen sweetheart, I'm used
to men who respond, so...

964
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,480
That girl
was driving you crazy.

965
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:51,233
The hell with that.

966
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:55,708
We'll just have to find
that hothead, won't we?

967
01:13:55,814 --> 01:14:00,832
Hey, Jean Pierre,
put my song on.

968
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:04,892
At least
there's a lobby here.

969
01:14:04,996 --> 01:14:09,916
Hey, sugar, does your woman ever
give you any room to breathe?

970
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,335
Reynosa,
Mexico/United States Border

971
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:18,620
Are you planning on fucking
her here in front of everyone?

972
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:23,063
No... she has a backache
from the bus ride.

973
01:14:23,169 --> 01:14:26,682
She asked me to
give her a massage, that's all.

974
01:14:26,785 --> 01:14:29,151
Calm down, rubbing doesn't make
you pregnant, honey.

975
01:14:29,248 --> 01:14:31,321
You're such a slut!

976
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,147
I need a room for two.

977
01:14:33,248 --> 01:14:36,247
Wait, Reina.

978
01:14:37,856 --> 01:14:42,198
Come here... how do you
plan to pay for that?

979
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,564
You think
I'm stupid, or what?

980
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:49,652
Why didn't you tell me
we had more money?

981
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:51,862
Put it away.

982
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:54,484
- How much is it?
- There's no regular rooms left.

983
01:14:54,588 --> 01:14:57,621
Don't spend our money
on this.

984
01:14:57,724 --> 01:15:00,211
I hate the snores and
farts of all those people.

985
01:15:00,316 --> 01:15:02,138
We're sleeping alone
and that's final.

986
01:15:02,235 --> 01:15:04,177
We'll gonna save that money and
sleep where we're supposed to!

987
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:08,538
Why, don't you want to sleep
with me alone?

988
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,781
How much is it again?

989
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:17,328
400 Pesos, and 200 for
the vibrating bed.

990
01:15:17,433 --> 01:15:20,018
But we're not gonna use that,
we're just gonna sleep.

991
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,469
How am l
supposed to know that?

992
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:27,352
Reina, we shouldn't be spending
that money.

993
01:15:27,448 --> 01:15:29,389
Oh, Marlon.

994
01:15:29,494 --> 01:15:31,534
If you don't know
how to use it...

995
01:15:31,638 --> 01:15:36,340
I'm right here to help you,
my queen.

996
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,423
She is hot, man.

997
01:15:59,954 --> 01:16:01,296
Were you dreaming?

998
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:03,304
Yeah, it was
the strangest dream.

999
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:06,606
I dreamt I was shitting fish.

1000
01:16:06,706 --> 01:16:09,006
Fish?

1001
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:12,748
They were orange,
like goldfish.

1002
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:16,164
They were swimming around
in the toilet.

1003
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,766
Did you flush?

1004
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:23,306
No, that's when I woke up.

1005
01:16:23,407 --> 01:16:25,032
What do you
think it means?

1006
01:16:25,135 --> 01:16:29,258
That not everything you
have inside you is shit.

1007
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:09,629
Didn't you
want to wait until New York?

1008
01:17:09,736 --> 01:17:13,827
I'm sore, rub me.

1009
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:19,525
Tear it.

1010
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:45,975
Hey, turtledoves, be downstairs
in exactly one minute,

1011
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,156
or you're screwed, understand?

1012
01:17:48,259 --> 01:17:51,456
If you stay here you're going
to be in a mess of trouble.

1013
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:55,742
My clothes?

1014
01:17:55,842 --> 01:17:58,428
Here, asshole!

1015
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,620
Hurry up!

1016
01:18:35,868 --> 01:18:38,255
Oh, no way!

1017
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:40,850
Wipe that expression off your
face, it reeks of poverty.

1018
01:18:40,955 --> 01:18:42,678
But look
at the prices, Roger.

1019
01:18:42,777 --> 01:18:45,015
Don't be an ass,
pick whatever you want.

1020
01:18:45,114 --> 01:18:46,324
Are you serious?

1021
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:49,108
I'm serious,
whatever you want.

1022
01:18:50,873 --> 01:18:54,834
Except that, it looks
really tacky.

1023
01:18:58,456 --> 01:19:01,302
- How's this?
- Perfect.

1024
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:02,926
Even the color?

1025
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:05,879
Even the color...
do you need pants?

1026
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:08,843
Sure...

1027
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:10,804
these are
a bit expensive though.

1028
01:19:10,902 --> 01:19:14,479
Cut that shit out,
they're perfect.

1029
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:15,989
Hold the bag.

1030
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:19,020
Make sure nobody gets close.

1031
01:19:21,205 --> 01:19:24,303
How dare you get me into
trouble, you asshole.

1032
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:26,345
B- b-b-be quiet, idiot.

1033
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:28,688
- N-n-n-no w-w-way!
- Don't make fun of me.

1034
01:19:28,787 --> 01:19:32,583
Roger, no, this is why these
people always suspect us.

1035
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,656
Open the bag,
put this in here.

1036
01:19:37,745 --> 01:19:40,079
Here, toss these
out some place.

1037
01:19:55,344 --> 01:19:57,515
We started running-
and Roger?

1038
01:19:57,615 --> 01:20:01,094
He was running!
He looked so funny!

1039
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:04,394
And after all that we made it
home, and look,

1040
01:20:04,494 --> 01:20:07,428
he gave me
new clothes with patches.

1041
01:20:07,534 --> 01:20:09,541
- lt looks cool.
- What about these sticks?

1042
01:20:09,646 --> 01:20:13,703
Wouldn't it be easier to
use the wide part of the sticks?

1043
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:17,448
- No, like I told you.
- But everything is falling off.

1044
01:20:17,548 --> 01:20:22,088
I know... hold on, this is
how they taught me.

1045
01:20:22,188 --> 01:20:24,326
Hey, if they'd caught you,
you'd be on a plane

1046
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:26,084
straight to Colombia.

1047
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:29,318
I don't know whether to laugh
or worry about you.

1048
01:20:29,419 --> 01:20:33,728
So... would you
really worry about me?

1049
01:20:48,103 --> 01:20:50,471
Marlon, look!

1050
01:20:50,568 --> 01:20:53,764
- Would you take me to that?
- To what?

1051
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:06,174
You're out so much,

1052
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:08,830
I will add a third shift
for your b-b-b-

1053
01:21:08,932 --> 01:21:10,754
Bed!

1054
01:21:10,851 --> 01:21:13,502
Like a friend of mine says,
"around pimps and whores,

1055
01:21:13,604 --> 01:21:15,197
keep a low profile."

1056
01:21:15,299 --> 01:21:18,594
So you're telling me this
because I'm a pimp or a w-whore?

1057
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:23,065
- A whore!
- Exactly... here, put this on.

1058
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:27,196
Yeah, there you go,
the best.

1059
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:29,599
Look at that, you look hot!

1060
01:21:29,697 --> 01:21:31,835
You're sure it's okay
to go to a salsa concert?

1061
01:21:31,937 --> 01:21:33,792
Relax, it's gonna be fine,

1062
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:36,189
you'll knock that B-B-Brittany
wannabe off her feet.

1063
01:21:36,288 --> 01:21:38,775
So what do you think,
open or closed?

1064
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,655
Zip it up, totally closed,
yeah, there you go.

1065
01:21:45,951 --> 01:21:49,082
Hey, wait a minute.

1066
01:21:51,966 --> 01:21:53,853
I'll be back late, Roger.

1067
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:56,088
Careful with the lights.

1068
01:22:27,225 --> 01:22:29,232
Reina?

1069
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:31,245
Reina!

1070
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:34,766
Reina! Hey!

1071
01:24:13,418 --> 01:24:16,034
Man, you got it bad,
my friend.

1072
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:18,983
You gotta stop this
obsession with her, Marlon.

1073
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:22,821
I'm not obsessed, Miss Patricia,
I saw her, I'm sure it was her.

1074
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:24,479
You're mistaking her
for somebody else.

1075
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:27,452
You end up seeing
what you want to see.

1076
01:24:27,558 --> 01:24:32,959
I hate to disappoint you,
but this time it was really her.

1077
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:40,382
Can I get change, please?

1078
01:24:45,188 --> 01:24:47,871
That poor girl is
the one paying the consequences.

1079
01:24:47,972 --> 01:24:50,939
Everywhere you look, you
see her, you'll end up crazy.

1080
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,504
And you'll drive the rest
of us crazy with you.

1081
01:24:52,611 --> 01:24:54,171
Hey, Giovanny,
come on, man, I'm not crazy.

1082
01:24:54,275 --> 01:24:57,438
Oh, no? All I ever hear from you
is Reina here, Reina there.

1083
01:24:57,538 --> 01:24:58,813
Who do you think you are,
some kind of king?

1084
01:24:58,913 --> 01:25:01,215
It's the same thing everyday!

1085
01:25:01,314 --> 01:25:03,833
I think as long
as you're still seeing one,

1086
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:07,286
you should stop seeing
the other one.

1087
01:25:54,361 --> 01:25:58,005
Wh-wh-what was that?

1088
01:25:58,104 --> 01:25:59,959
What?

1089
01:26:00,057 --> 01:26:02,806
The silence.

1090
01:26:04,663 --> 01:26:06,867
Roger, what's going on?

1091
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:13,430
What is it, Roger?

1092
01:26:13,527 --> 01:26:14,933
Get up, we've got to get
out of here.

1093
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:18,478
Quick, before the
po-po-police get here.

1094
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:21,199
Turn on the light, Roger.

1095
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,854
No, no...
there's no time, come on!

1096
01:26:23,957 --> 01:26:27,218
If you don't leave now, you'll
have to deal with the visitors.

1097
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,454
Roger!

1098
01:26:29,556 --> 01:26:32,174
Roger! wait for me!

1099
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:33,520
Are you coming back here?

1100
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:34,863
Rats will be
the only ones coming back

1101
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:37,036
to collect the scraps!

1102
01:26:37,139 --> 01:26:38,667
and you still
owe me this week's rent.

1103
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,712
Wait for me!

1104
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,764
Roger!

1105
01:27:22,956 --> 01:27:24,779
- Good evening, sir.
- Who are you?

1106
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:26,632
I'm a friend of Milagros.

1107
01:27:26,731 --> 01:27:28,226
This is no time
to be paying visits.

1108
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:31,528
Could you be so kind as to
tell her I'm here?

1109
01:27:33,355 --> 01:27:35,296
I know him,
uncle, don't worry.

1110
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:37,344
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1111
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:41,957
What do you want?

1112
01:27:42,057 --> 01:27:44,610
It's the bicycle's fault,
It brought me here.

1113
01:27:44,713 --> 01:27:45,891
What did it want?

1114
01:27:45,993 --> 01:27:49,189
This is all shit,

1115
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:51,174
and to top it off,
I've got nowhere to sleep.

1116
01:27:51,272 --> 01:27:53,825
So you came here
so I could help you?

1117
01:27:53,928 --> 01:27:56,316
But you're the only person-

1118
01:27:56,423 --> 01:27:57,731
I'm not the only anything,
Marlon.

1119
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,653
The only thing you have in that
head of yours is confusion.

1120
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:03,132
You don't even know
whether you're coming or going.

1121
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,725
You don't even know
what you see, asshole!

1122
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:09,539
It's been
very difficult for me too.

1123
01:28:09,637 --> 01:28:13,466
The truth is, I'm sick
of fighting with a ghost.

1124
01:28:13,573 --> 01:28:17,249
Then get out of here with your
damn ghost and leave me alone!

1125
01:28:28,513 --> 01:28:30,456
Why am I such an idiot?

1126
01:28:30,562 --> 01:28:34,522
Come in quickly,
before I change my mind.

1127
01:29:16,827 --> 01:29:20,274
Are you Milagros' boyfriend?

1128
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:22,647
Everybody,
this is Marlon.

1129
01:29:22,747 --> 01:29:26,837
I've told you he'll be staying
here a few days.

1130
01:29:26,938 --> 01:29:28,792
- Good morning, Marlon.
- Good morning.

1131
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,645
Good moming,
ma'am, how are you?

1132
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:34,934
- Sit down.
- Excuse me.

1133
01:29:35,031 --> 01:29:36,559
Hello.

1134
01:29:36,664 --> 01:29:38,900
This all looks great...
these arepas look weird.

1135
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,203
So... where do you work?

1136
01:29:41,303 --> 01:29:42,678
At "Mi Tierra Colombiana."'

1137
01:29:42,775 --> 01:29:46,387
Really? You know the rules here,
don't you?

1138
01:29:46,488 --> 01:29:48,080
No, but I'll tell him.

1139
01:29:48,182 --> 01:29:51,663
It's very simple, if you live
here, you pay your way.

1140
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:53,074
Let him eat breakfast.

1141
01:29:53,173 --> 01:29:55,507
He has a job,
he can contribute.

1142
01:29:55,606 --> 01:29:58,288
If money's the problem,
then there's no problem,

1143
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:01,170
because there's no money!

1144
01:30:06,995 --> 01:30:08,970
I started to eam
some more money, Mom.

1145
01:30:09,075 --> 01:30:11,180
- You did?
- Yes.

1146
01:30:11,283 --> 01:30:12,744
Tell Aunt Marlene
not to worry.

1147
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:15,600
That I'm going
to pay her back every penny.

1148
01:30:15,697 --> 01:30:18,828
I've also sent you an envelope
with some money.

1149
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:22,311
I'm glad, son,
that sounds great! Thank God!

1150
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,239
That makes me very happy!

1151
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:26,092
Hey, Mom, how's Mateo?

1152
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:27,240
Is he behaving himself?

1153
01:30:27,345 --> 01:30:29,483
Yes, he is doing
very good, Marlon,

1154
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:33,096
but he misses you very much,
we all miss you very much here.

1155
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,941
Oh, Mom... would it be possible
to speak with Dad?

1156
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:39,428
It's better to wait a little
until you send more money.

1157
01:30:39,535 --> 01:30:41,739
That way he'll see you
will take care of that debt.

1158
01:30:41,838 --> 01:30:44,555
Just tell him
that I love him, okay?

1159
01:30:44,653 --> 01:30:46,344
Your blessing, mom.

1160
01:30:46,446 --> 01:30:49,293
God bless you, my son,
good-bye! Take care!

1161
01:30:49,389 --> 01:30:53,217
- You too.
- Bye, honey!

1162
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,690
What about your grandmother?

1163
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:26,370
Don't worry, it's okay.

1164
01:32:01,985 --> 01:32:04,538
I'm going to get some water,
want some?

1165
01:32:18,047 --> 01:32:19,738
All set, Mr. Pastor.

1166
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,036
- How did it go?
- $3 in tips.

1167
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:26,644
Biscuit!

1168
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:30,492
I don't believe it, Calena!
Here, Mr. Pastor.

1169
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:33,491
What are you doing here?

1170
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:36,630
Gorgeous!

1171
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:39,602
You just tore my heart to pieces
when I heard the message

1172
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:41,650
you put up for
the hothead on the radio.

1173
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,057
Oh, Calena, that doesn't matter
to me anymore.

1174
01:32:44,156 --> 01:32:46,971
Right, and I was born yesterday.

1175
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,784
Do me a favor, sweetie,
and bring us two shots.

1176
01:32:49,882 --> 01:32:53,527
I've got some great news that
will knock you off your feet.

1177
01:32:53,627 --> 01:32:56,528
- Two?
- One for you and one for me.

1178
01:32:56,635 --> 01:32:58,096
Everything okay, Marlon?

1179
01:32:58,202 --> 01:32:59,609
Yes, ma'am.

1180
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:02,388
She's a friend who made the trip
here with us.

1181
01:33:02,489 --> 01:33:04,180
Excuse me.

1182
01:33:06,297 --> 01:33:07,505
- Here you go.
- Where is yours?

1183
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:09,200
I can't, I'm working.

1184
01:33:09,304 --> 01:33:14,092
So, tell me why are you here?

1185
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:18,258
Delicious,
great for my sore legs.

1186
01:33:23,573 --> 01:33:27,249
- Your little queen.
- The bathroom, please.

1187
01:33:27,349 --> 01:33:32,205
- Where is this?
- It's an address in Atlanta.

1188
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:35,026
Atlanta? Are you sure?

1189
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,677
Stop it, do you really think
I would waste my time

1190
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,469
to come all the way over here,

1191
01:33:39,571 --> 01:33:41,905
if I wasn't absolutely sure
she was there?

1192
01:33:42,003 --> 01:33:44,905
And don't you dare tell
her it was me who told you.

1193
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:46,832
- Thank you, Miss Patricia.
- Because remember-

1194
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:49,002
Remember that bimbo
doesn't like me.

1195
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:51,211
Calena, are you
absolutely sure?

1196
01:33:51,313 --> 01:33:56,648
Enough... call her,
you've got the number,

1197
01:33:56,754 --> 01:34:00,015
and then you'll see
I'm not bullshitting you.

1198
01:34:07,919 --> 01:34:09,862
God bless you.

1199
01:34:24,749 --> 01:34:26,536
What's going on?

1200
01:34:30,828 --> 01:34:32,737
Hello, please leave your
name...

1201
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:38,212
Big kiss and thanks.

1202
01:34:38,314 --> 01:34:42,504
It's her, it's her.

1203
01:34:47,466 --> 01:34:49,637
What happened?

1204
01:35:08,231 --> 01:35:10,816
What's going on?

1205
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,092
Why are you packing?
What's going on?

1206
01:35:21,796 --> 01:35:24,894
Where are you going?

1207
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,128
Talk to me, asshole,
where are you going?

1208
01:35:31,235 --> 01:35:34,049
Where are you going?
Talk to me!

1209
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:41,085
You're going to Reina.

1210
01:35:41,185 --> 01:35:43,487
Marlon, talk to me,
at least look at me, fucker!

1211
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:47,545
Don't be such a coward,
look me in the eyes.

1212
01:35:47,648 --> 01:35:51,510
Marlon, please don't go!

1213
01:35:51,615 --> 01:35:54,484
If you leave,
don't ever come back, asshole!

1214
01:36:34,265 --> 01:36:37,015
Texas, United States

1215
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,874
Wake up, assholes,
we're here.

1216
01:36:41,976 --> 01:36:44,048
Let me out!

1217
01:36:44,152 --> 01:36:48,079
Let me out of here,
open up!

1218
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:49,971
Let's go
or we'll all pay.

1219
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:52,851
Get down here-

1220
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:56,462
Get off, stupid fucking
"gringo.",

1221
01:36:56,565 --> 01:36:59,948
Come on, we've got to get out
of here, come on!

1222
01:37:03,253 --> 01:37:05,673
Hurry up, honey,
the gringos are coming.

1223
01:37:34,672 --> 01:37:36,843
Bring him down!

1224
01:37:39,441 --> 01:37:40,966
Bring him!

1225
01:37:46,766 --> 01:37:48,555
He's dead.

1226
01:37:52,525 --> 01:37:55,079
Look what
they've done to us, Reina.

1227
01:37:55,182 --> 01:37:57,003
What does it matter?

1228
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:59,783
We're here, the worst part
is already over.

1229
01:37:59,885 --> 01:38:03,495
We are in
The United States now!

1230
01:38:04,876 --> 01:38:07,429
We're here.

1231
01:38:16,586 --> 01:38:19,881
Atlanta, Georgia

1232
01:39:04,963 --> 01:39:06,850
Yes?

1233
01:39:06,946 --> 01:39:11,834
Raquel?

1234
01:39:11,938 --> 01:39:14,141
Are you Reina's mother?

1235
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:17,056
Have been all my life,
sweetheart.

1236
01:39:17,152 --> 01:39:20,055
Why? Do we know each other?

1237
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:24,502
I'm Marlon, Marlon Cruz.

1238
01:39:28,768 --> 01:39:32,477
You're just a baby.

1239
01:39:32,574 --> 01:39:35,192
Can I see her?

1240
01:39:35,294 --> 01:39:37,016
You want a drink?

1241
01:39:37,117 --> 01:39:39,932
Reina! No, ma'am,
thank you.

1242
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:42,549
I just want to see Reina.

1243
01:39:42,652 --> 01:39:45,522
Well, I'm going to have one,

1244
01:39:45,629 --> 01:39:48,312
because I haven't had
one for a while.

1245
01:39:48,413 --> 01:39:50,648
Where's that fucking bottle?

1246
01:39:50,748 --> 01:39:54,096
- ls Reina here?
- Here she is.

1247
01:39:54,203 --> 01:39:57,716
Look! Sure that you
don't want anything?

1248
01:39:57,819 --> 01:39:59,062
No, thank you.

1249
01:39:59,162 --> 01:40:00,919
I just came here to talk
to your daughter.

1250
01:40:01,017 --> 01:40:03,669
Re- Reina's not here.

1251
01:40:03,771 --> 01:40:05,296
Where is she?

1252
01:40:05,401 --> 01:40:07,255
Come here
and have a smoke with me.

1253
01:40:07,353 --> 01:40:11,543
Please, I've come a long way
and I need to see your daughter.

1254
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,673
She never told you about me?

1255
01:40:14,776 --> 01:40:17,361
Of course
she told me about you.

1256
01:40:17,463 --> 01:40:20,562
She told me you are
a very good boy.

1257
01:40:20,663 --> 01:40:24,460
My gosh, very, very good.

1258
01:40:24,567 --> 01:40:26,224
Did she tell you
we got lost?

1259
01:40:26,326 --> 01:40:29,325
- I don't remember.
- Then what do you remember?

1260
01:40:29,429 --> 01:40:32,114
Tell me what she told you.

1261
01:40:32,215 --> 01:40:34,221
That old lady
sings incredibly well.

1262
01:40:34,326 --> 01:40:40,587
* Black pigeon
black pigeon *

1263
01:40:40,693 --> 01:40:45,580
- Tell me!
- All right, don't get so pushy!

1264
01:40:45,683 --> 01:40:48,999
You're so desperate, baby.

1265
01:40:49,107 --> 01:40:53,776
Calm down,
we'll look for her.

1266
01:40:53,874 --> 01:40:57,005
You know what?
Wait for me here.

1267
01:41:29,581 --> 01:41:31,174
And this baby?

1268
01:41:31,277 --> 01:41:33,798
Beautiful, isn't she?

1269
01:41:33,901 --> 01:41:41,570
Baby... maybe you've got
a little money for a blow job?

1270
01:41:41,675 --> 01:41:45,897
Raquel, please just take me
to your daughter.

1271
01:41:48,522 --> 01:41:51,838
Fine then.

1272
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:57,793
We'll go find your queen...
get out.

1273
01:42:00,808 --> 01:42:02,947
Let's go!

1274
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:06,948
And so that
you don't complain,

1275
01:42:07,046 --> 01:42:09,251
I'm even taking you
in my Ferrari.

1276
01:42:15,686 --> 01:42:17,824
You're going
to drive like that?

1277
01:42:19,397 --> 01:42:22,014
Where does Reina work?

1278
01:42:22,116 --> 01:42:24,506
She does
a variety of things.

1279
01:42:29,412 --> 01:42:31,070
Is it far?

1280
01:42:31,173 --> 01:42:35,099
We're almost there.

1281
01:42:35,202 --> 01:42:38,814
- Where is it?
- She's just around the corner.

1282
01:42:38,915 --> 01:42:41,981
- Show up, "Reinita."'
- Hey watch out, drive carefully.

1283
01:42:42,082 --> 01:42:43,969
Queen of hearts...

1284
01:42:44,066 --> 01:42:49,150
your prince
is looking for you.

1285
01:42:54,943 --> 01:43:03,223
Look, look... there she is.

1286
01:43:11,294 --> 01:43:13,049
Reina!

1287
01:43:23,868 --> 01:43:28,024
Reina! Hey! Reina!

1288
01:43:30,587 --> 01:43:32,113
Reina!

1289
01:43:47,127 --> 01:43:48,655
Reina!

1290
01:43:52,535 --> 01:43:54,389
Reina!

1291
01:43:55,992 --> 01:43:59,765
I though you'd never come.

1292
01:44:05,429 --> 01:44:06,858
What happened to your eyes?

1293
01:44:06,965 --> 01:44:09,780
This is how they were
always meant to be.

1294
01:44:09,877 --> 01:44:12,265
Help me get her inside,
it's gonna start raining.

1295
01:44:12,372 --> 01:44:13,834
Whose baby
is that in the picture?

1296
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:17,137
That baby is none
of your business, help me.

1297
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:18,511
Take the keys.

1298
01:44:18,611 --> 01:44:21,959
Why didn't you tell me you
wanted to look for your mother?

1299
01:44:22,067 --> 01:44:27,467
- How did you find her?
- Looking for her; take the keys!

1300
01:44:27,569 --> 01:44:29,545
Come on, Mom, get out.

1301
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:31,438
Why didn't you look for me?

1302
01:44:31,537 --> 01:44:33,577
Where was I supposed
to look for you?

1303
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,747
I don't know, around the
same places I looked for you.

1304
01:44:36,848 --> 01:44:39,467
Everywhere... why did you make
me come with you

1305
01:44:39,568 --> 01:44:41,258
- if you were going to leave.
- I didn't leave you,

1306
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,247
you went out
and never came back.

1307
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:44,751
Give me the keys,
it's raining!

1308
01:44:44,848 --> 01:44:49,800
I got lost! If you had looked
for me, you would've found me,

1309
01:44:49,902 --> 01:44:52,237
just like
you found your mother.

1310
01:44:52,335 --> 01:44:56,589
Just give me the keys, we'll
talk inside, it's raining.

1311
01:44:56,686 --> 01:45:01,094
- Why didn'tyou call home?
- Give her the keys.

1312
01:45:01,197 --> 01:45:04,513
- Your father got sick.
- So what? I can still call.

1313
01:45:04,621 --> 01:45:08,132
Why didn't you ever tell
me about your mother.

1314
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:11,366
- That baby is mine, isn't she?
- Don't be such a fag!

1315
01:45:11,468 --> 01:45:14,368
Do you really think you were man
enough to give me a baby?

1316
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:18,664
- ls she mine? Answer me!
- No, don't be such an asshole!

1317
01:45:18,763 --> 01:45:21,183
Can't you see the baby is inside
and I'm getting wet?!

1318
01:45:21,289 --> 01:45:22,850
Give me the keys!

1319
01:45:27,465 --> 01:45:32,516
You haven't changed a bit,
Marlon, not a bit.

1320
01:45:32,617 --> 01:45:37,666
You're wrong; believe it or not
I have changed thanks to you.

1321
01:45:37,768 --> 01:45:42,404
I'm not going to try to reproach
something I can't change.

1322
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:45,350
On the contrary,

1323
01:45:45,446 --> 01:45:50,017
now I understand that love isn't
why I followed you here.

1324
01:45:50,118 --> 01:45:53,795
I doubt there was
ever any love between us.

1325
01:45:53,893 --> 01:45:56,926
Nevertheless I want to thank
you for bringing me on this trip

1326
01:45:57,029 --> 01:46:01,119
and above all
thank you for abandoning me,

1327
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:04,602
for not looking for me.

1328
01:46:08,867 --> 01:46:11,517
Why did you come?
Why did you come here?

1329
01:46:11,618 --> 01:46:15,741
- I had to find you, Reina.
- Great, now you found me,

1330
01:46:15,843 --> 01:46:19,257
now you can go to fucking hell
for all I care!

1331
01:46:19,362 --> 01:46:22,842
You can go kill
yourself if you feel like it!

1332
01:46:22,946 --> 01:46:27,897
No, I don't feel like it.

1333
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,960
You go ahead and
kill yourself if you want to.
