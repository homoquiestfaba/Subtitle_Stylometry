1
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:08,736
The surgical scalpel is made
of sterilized, carbonized

2
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:09,928
stainless steel.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,372
This is a vast improvement
over the first scalpel,

4
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:15,968
which was pretty much a sharp stick.

5
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:18,735
Medicine is constantly reinventing itself.

6
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:20,325
That means surgeons have to

7
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:21,916
keep reinventing themselves, too.

8
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,267
I can't believe we're doing this.

9
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,726
It's Valentine's day.

10
00:00:24,726 --> 00:00:26,760
We don't do Valentine's day.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,925
There's more to life than the hospital.

12
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,091
No, there isn't.

13
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:30,280
It's romantic.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,845
No, it isn't.

15
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:35,418
There's constant pressure
to adapt to changes.

16
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,024
Ambulance!

17
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,718
It can be a painful process.

18
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,413
Eyes front, ladies.

19
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:41,165
But without it...

20
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,859
Okay, that seemed big.

21
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,310
If it's big, they'll page us.

22
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:53,446
It's big.

23
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:54,497
Yes!

24
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,023
You'll find yourself moving backwards

25
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,862
instead of forwards.

26
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,655
Hey, what's going on?

27
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:07,862
Grandinetti's roof collapsed.

28
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:08,824
We'll be getting more than a dozen.

29
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,370
All scheduled procedures are pushed.

30
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,917
Ugh. On Valentine's day?

31
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,839
God, grandinetti's must have been packed.

32
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,273
Well, tonight's out. I
told you this would happen.

33
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:17,917
Well, that's why we went to dinner at 4:00

34
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,559
and exchanged gifts. Look.

35
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:23,230
Just special. Original. Magical.

36
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,455
- Squeals of joy.
- Wow. Scrooge.

37
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:28,829
Scrooge is Christmas. That's a holiday.

38
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,772
Dr. Bailey. Our hemicolectomy's pushed.

39
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,365
That's a shame. I was... I was
really looking forward to that.

40
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:36,342
Well, as... you know....

41
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,212
Well, maybe we could make up for it.

42
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,706
- Dinner tomorrow?
- No.

43
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,227
Um... just...

44
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,829
I'm... busy.

45
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,667
I have surgeries most nights.

46
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:46,590
I always have surgery.

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,243
Right. Well, um, maybe
see you in the O.R., then.

48
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:02,575
Oh, my God. She likes him.

49
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:05,851
Oh, you like him? Oh, my God.

50
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,583
You should totally go out with him.

51
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,706
You have to say yes.

52
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,829
Oh, no. It's Valentine's day. You have to.

53
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,576
Okay, see, that... this right here,

54
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:13,616
what's happening, the giggling...

55
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,712
the girl talk, the OMGs...
okay, it has to stop.

56
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:18,335
I am busy.

57
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,264
Hey, Torres.

58
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,033
Do you know anything about
putting together cribs?

59
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,798
You bought a crib?

60
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,166
Well, Sloan's coming home tonight,

61
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,688
and I got it put together, but it wobbles.

62
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:34,169
And it can't wobble.

63
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,009
Now will you take a look at it?

64
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,530
You're like a sweet, nerdy dad now.

65
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,726
I don't even recognize you.

66
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,826
Well... who's the blonde?

67
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,543
I don't know.

68
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,088
I may be a dad, but I am a single dad.

69
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,511
Excuse me.

70
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:53,009
Okay. Now... now I recognize you.

71
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,067
It must, uh,

72
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,717
suck to work on Valentine's day.

73
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,796
I don't believe we've met.

74
00:02:56,796 --> 00:03:01,281
Aah! What'd you do to your hair?!

75
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,955
I changed it. I... I colored it.

76
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:04,577
I just...

77
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:08,273
Wait. You thought I was someone else.

78
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,019
You didn't know it was me
and you were hitting on me?

79
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:10,784
No, no.

80
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,990
I pretty much thought you were,
you know, just some blonde.

81
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,580
You are pathetic and hypocritical

82
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,360
- and slutty.
- And you are no blonde.

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,943
You can't pull that off.

84
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:23,515
Blondes are either badass or fun.

85
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:26,421
And you're... you're a brunette.

86
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:30,529
Damn.

87
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:31,729
Shut up!

88
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,695
Quit staring. I'm probably
gonna change it back anyway.

89
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:44,840
No, I... I get it.

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,468
You get dumped by your boyfriend,

91
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:47,682
and you go for the extreme makeover.

92
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:50,085
- Chicks always do that.
- I didn't get dumped. Okay?

93
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,518
And I did not do this for Mark. I just...

94
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:55,937
It's Valentine's day, and I
wanted to change something.

95
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,091
And... and I could change...

96
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:59,655
I... I wanted to do
something for me, okay?

97
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,230
This was for me.

98
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,424
How is that different
than what I just said?

99
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,092
I'm changing it back.

100
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:14,947
Restaurant roof collapse.

101
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,247
Yeah, so far... a
penetrating abdominal injury,

102
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,197
a sucking chest wound
and a massive head wound.

103
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:20,310
Also, there's an open fracture on the way.

104
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,209
- Do you want me...
- Dr. Shepherd.

105
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,941
- Oh, you're still here?
- If you're here, I'm here.

106
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,634
There's an osha investigator
waiting in the lobby,

107
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:26,893
and there's also two tv crews
who are asking for a statement.

108
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,025
I told 'em to wait for you.

109
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,369
- They're setting up outside.
- We cleared the O.R. board,

110
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,171
also, I paged Bailey, Nelson,
Altman, Hagan and Sloan.

111
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,287
As soon as I have all
of the numbers, I'll...

112
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:34,427
- Do you want to get anybody else?
- Stop. Who do I see first?

113
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,853
- Skull fracture, trauma 1.
- The osha guy.

114
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,552
- Chart, please.
- Try to get as many people as possible

115
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,544
off the backboards.

116
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:41,591
Clear C-spines clinically,

117
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,689
but if you're not sure, wait for x-ray

118
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,083
- no matter how backed up they are.
- Hey, hold the elevator.

119
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,027
- I got it!
- Trauma 4 is open.

120
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,285
- Okay, uh, bring the chart, please.
- Right away.

121
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,483
Where are they taking my husband?

122
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:54,681
Uh, he's going into surgery.

123
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,402
His doctors will let us know more soon.

124
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:57,694
Can you take a deep breath for me, please?

125
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:58,512
What do you have, Grey?

126
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,025
Decreased breath sounds on the left side.

127
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,022
Possibly a pneumothorax.

128
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,755
All right, put in a
chest tube if you need to.

129
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:05,050
Evaluate and page me if it's surgical.

130
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,844
Sorry. I'm sorry.

131
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,887
- Nonresponsive...
- Okay, let me see the chart.

132
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:12,612
Looks like a pretty bad break.

133
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,729
You're gonna have to have that reset.

134
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,786
I wonder if there's any chance

135
00:05:15,786 --> 00:05:17,919
you could put me in a
bed next to that lady?

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,010
Yeah, sorry. It doesn't work like that.

137
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,678
Of course. Forgive me.

138
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,385
I've been a head waiter for 25 years.

139
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,005
I know how it works.

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,850
I'll see what I can do.

141
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,602
It's a depressed skull fracture
with a subdural hematoma.

142
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,835
- All right? Let's book an O.R.
- Chief.

143
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,680
Yeah. I need you to reassign
some anesthesiologists.

144
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,351
- You're being cupid for Bailey.
- I don't do that.

145
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:43,674
I did that once, and she yelled at me.

146
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:46,236
- I'll be cupid. You just be the chief. Sign.
- I am not cupid.

147
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:48,964
Dr. Shepherd, the reporters
are waiting for a statement.

148
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:50,980
- I have a surgery.
- Well, actually, Dr. Nelson said

149
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,949
he could take your skull fracture.

150
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:54,119
You've got the trustee's
breakfast in the morning,

151
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,107
and when the trustees
turn on the 11:00 news,

152
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,760
it's your face they'll want to see.

153
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:05,093
- Watch it! Coming through!
- I got the arm.

154
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:05,986
What do you got?

155
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:08,073
Traumatic amputation through
the left distal humerus.

156
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,466
Bleeding controlled through
pressure. Got 10 of morphine.

157
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,618
Vital signs are stable.

158
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,861
Okay, let's get him in trauma
3, put him on a monitor.

159
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:16,270
Push two of o-neg. Grey,
Avery, you're with me.

160
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,933
Chief Shepherd?

161
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,450
Can she have some water, please?

162
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,704
I'm afraid she can't.

163
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,307
My... Emile, stop.

164
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,309
My husband and I have been going to

165
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,262
grandinetti's for 15 years,

166
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:42,766
every Friday night.

167
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,689
And sometimes Tuesdays.

168
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:48,630
Emile always takes very good care of us.

169
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,704
But now it's time to look after yourself.

170
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:55,462
I just thought you'd want someone with you

171
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:58,153
until you found out
that Mr. Banks was okay.

172
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:00,706
Thank you.

173
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:05,067
My patient's stalking your patient.

174
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,716
He's being a good waiter,

175
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:08,086
and apparently, we're his busboys.

176
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:10,371
Dude gave me 50 bucks
to put him next to her.

177
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,337
He's got the hots for her.

178
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:14,299
Her husband is in surgery. She's married.

179
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,140
You're just saying that 'cause
you think you're married.

180
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,904
His 50 bucks says he makes a move.

181
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:22,189
- You in or out?
- I'm in, and I am married.

182
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,472
Mrs. Shepherd?

183
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:25,855
Huh?

184
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,938
I'm not Mrs. Shepherd.

185
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:30,383
- You're not?
- I'm Dr. Grey.

186
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,582
Right. Right.

187
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,584
Um, chief Shepherd
wanted me to ask you about

188
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:35,881
the trustee's breakfast in the morning.

189
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,544
You Shepherd's flunky now?
Is that why he hired you back?

190
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:41,268
I'm on his service this week,
and during this transition,

191
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,745
he needed a little more help
on the administrative side.

192
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:45,250
I'm not his flunky.

193
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,384
So, uh, will you be going
with him to the breakfast

194
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,402
or meeting him there?

195
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:53,367
I, um, am not sure I'm going.

196
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,546
What? No.

197
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:58,139
You have to 'cause you're his wife.

198
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:05,977
Sloan?

199
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,167
When did you get in? Does
Mark know you're here?

200
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,258
Um, no. My flight got
in a little bit early,

201
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,406
and I just took a cab over. I
didn't to bug him or anything.

202
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:14,779
Somebody said that you
guys have a free clinic?

203
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:17,126
- Do you know where that is?
- Is everything okay?

204
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,610
Oh, yeah. I just want
someone to check me out...

205
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,033
after the surgery and everything.

206
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,440
Maybe give me an ultrasound or something?

207
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,233
Yeah, the clinic closed an hour ago.

208
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,738
Come on. I have a second.

209
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:29,810
I'll take a peek for you.

210
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,752
Okay, I need another 4x4.

211
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:34,635
Okay, dress him. I'm gonna
take another look at the arm.

212
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,912
This wound's completely
macerated and contaminated.

213
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,505
Why wasn't this guy brought in first?

214
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:40,499
He was lying in dirty
dishwater for a while

215
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,437
before they found him.

216
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,547
They forgot I was back there.

217
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,583
No, I'm...

218
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,597
it's all right.

219
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:49,581
I'm not...

220
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,955
I'm not too big on
talking to people, and...

221
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:55,610
nobody talks to me much back there.

222
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,509
They just, you know, bring me the dishes.

223
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,691
I lost my arm.

224
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,607
I don't want to have one arm.

225
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,159
I don't want to be a freak.

226
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,023
I... I don't like people staring at me.

227
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:13,156
We're gonna do everything that we can.

228
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,185
Please.

229
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:16,928
Okay, Frankie, I'll take
you up to surgery now.

230
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:19,310
We're gonna try and
reattach the arm, okay?

231
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,598
- We have an open O.R.
- I'll prep him, work on the stump.

232
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:24,254
You debride the arm, tag the vessels,

233
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:25,791
and get it up to me as
soon as you can, okay? Okay.

234
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,380
Wow. Trauma room Barbie.

235
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,010
Okay, irrigation here
and suction, please. So...

236
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,272
Here you go.

237
00:09:39,272 --> 00:09:42,467
Grandinetti's is gone...
a Seattle institution.

238
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:44,325
Hmm. Dr. Warren, you ever been there?

239
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,089
Couple times. Good scampi.

240
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,655
Place is so romantic...
perfectly lit, intimate,

241
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,091
those cozy little
booths, you know, in back.

242
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,617
A 3-0 silk tie, please.

243
00:09:53,617 --> 00:09:56,562
It's a little too intense
for a first date, though.

244
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,659
Bailey, where would
you go on a first date?

245
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,160
- Isn't there a dying child somewhere?
- No. I had some time,

246
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,380
and I wanted to observe
one of... one of these.

247
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:08,698
Aww.

248
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,246
Baby looks perfect.

249
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,241
Awesome.

250
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,274
Um, can I, like, get that in writing?

251
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,712
Oh, even better.

252
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,806
Here is a souvenir.

253
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:22,786
Oh, um... well, don't
you have some kind of,

254
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:24,398
like, official form

255
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:27,494
or hospital document that you can give me?

256
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,476
Why do you need an official form?

257
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,193
Oh, well, that's none of your business.

258
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:34,770
If you want your official
form, it is, Sloan.

259
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,042
What's going on?

260
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,867
It's for the adoption attorney, okay?

261
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:42,774
They need, like, a clean bill
of health from me or something.

262
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:44,890
There's this great
couple in San Francisco,

263
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,885
- and they have these two big dogs, and...
- An adoption attorney?

264
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:51,038
Yeah. I mean, I'm not ready to be a mom.

265
00:10:51,038 --> 00:10:53,262
I'm just... I'm just not ready yet.

266
00:10:54,185 --> 00:10:55,567
Have you told Mark?

267
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:59,111
No. And... you're my doctor, right?

268
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:00,674
I mean, don't you guys
have some kind of rule

269
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:01,976
that says you can't say anything?

270
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:05,241
Well, I'm not gonna tell
him, and neither are you.

271
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you think she needs an extra blanket?

272
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:16,399
She gets chilled easily.

273
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,871
She must be one hell of a tipper.

274
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:20,723
- Sorry?
- Well, I can see why she comes in every week.

275
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,033
I bet you take better care
of her than her own husband.

276
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:31,939
When she first started
coming in, before they met,

277
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:33,538
we had a little game.

278
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,333
She would try anything we served.

279
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,496
She was adventurous...

280
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,558
fearless.

281
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,744
When she'd gone through the menu,

282
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,397
I challenged the chefs to
come up with something new.

283
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,080
It became...

284
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,972
she became... my
favorite part of the week.

285
00:11:53,064 --> 00:11:54,745
Then one night, she came in with him.

286
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,830
She felt like this was a
safe place for a first date.

287
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,580
That ring on her finger?

288
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,588
The night he proposed to her...

289
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,809
I placed it in the crème
brûlée for her to find.

290
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,683
I watched her say yes
from the kitchen window.

291
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,435
And they never stopped coming in.

292
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,265
But now he orders for her...

293
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,252
same thing every time.

294
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:29,802
For 15 years,

295
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:33,421
I've watched their conversations
grow shorter and shorter,

296
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:36,574
until now all they do is eat.

297
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,948
She has no children.

298
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,753
If he dies, she'll be...

299
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:52,680
she'll be all alone.

300
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,297
She's so afraid. I... I can see.

301
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:58,465
And all I want to do
is take her hand in mine

302
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,645
and tell her she'll be all right.

303
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:05,880
She'll never have to be alone...

304
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,522
if she doesn't want to be.

305
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:15,637
You'll let me know

306
00:13:15,637 --> 00:13:18,316
when you have good news
about Mr. Banks, yes?

307
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:21,406
Yeah. Right. Of course.

308
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,385
You can't leave without telling him.

309
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:47,710
- Yes, I can. I can do whatever I...
- Sloan.

310
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,692
Crap.

311
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:49,974
When did you get here?

312
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,329
I mean, I thought you
were gonna call first.

313
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:56,309
Look. Oh, my God.

314
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:58,462
Would you look at that?

315
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,513
That's the Sloan nose.

316
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:02,006
Can you... can you see it?

317
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:02,783
Can you see it?

318
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,662
It's my dad's. He has my dad's nose.

319
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,770
That's the Sloan nose.

320
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,067
Damn it. Will you wait for me?

321
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:15,940
I want to... I want to take you home.

322
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,948
I got a surprise for you.
Oh, could I see this again?

323
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,183
The Sloan nose.

324
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,458
You win.

325
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,045
He's been staring at her
from his kitchen for 15 years.

326
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,226
He's not gonna tell her now.

327
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:35,796
He just did. She was awake the whole time.

328
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,808
She heard everything.
She has to say something.

329
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:40,088
Well, she's not. He...
her husband's in surgery.

330
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,691
So? They're clearly miserable.

331
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:44,005
I mean, did you hear the
whole crème brûlée thing?

332
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:47,910
- 50 bucks says she tells him she loves him, too.
- You're on.

333
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,293
Hi.

334
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,806
I've got your keys.

335
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,493
- What?
- Dr. Shepherd told me you might not make it home

336
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,147
before the breakfast,
so I should just ask you

337
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:57,225
what you need from your closet,
and I'll go grab it for you.

338
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:58,937
You are not going in my closet.

339
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:00,349
Aren't you supposed to be a surgeon?

340
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,812
He really needs you by his side

341
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:03,703
- at that breakfast.
- I am a surgeon.

342
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,185
You tell the chief that
I will be in surgery.

343
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,851
Uh, so... so I'll just
pick something out for you.

344
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:16,320
So... Yang's with Hunt,

345
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,251
Grey's with Shepherd,
Torres is with Robbins,

346
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,293
and you were with Sloan
until he dumped you?

347
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,305
It's a wonder you guys got any work done.

348
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,129
He didn't dump me.

349
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,646
He forgot about me.

350
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:30,952
He decided that we were
going to start a family

351
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,224
and didn't ask me.

352
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:34,607
He forgot I was even there.

353
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:37,716
He... he just... left me
lying in dirty dishwater.

354
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,443
What?

355
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,383
Nothing.

356
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,036
I'm pretty.

357
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:49,836
What?

358
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:52,581
In my family, I'm the pretty one.

359
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:57,480
You know, uh, my eyes
and... my smile and my body.

360
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,305
I mean, you should see
me without a shirt on.

361
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,788
It's... it's kind of ridiculous.

362
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:04,479
But my family is smart, driven,

363
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,659
crazy overachievers, you know?

364
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,101
And they look like they're smart.

365
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,305
They don't look like
me, which had its perks,

366
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:14,017
except that my family
treated me like I'm pretty.

367
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:18,162
They expected nothing from me... ever.

368
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,761
They never pushed me, never thought to.

369
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:22,433
So I had to push myself...

370
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,843
hard.

371
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,938
I didn't even tell 'em
I was taking the mcat's

372
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:27,569
till after I had aced 'em.

373
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,218
My point is that you can't
just change your hair.

374
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,693
Okay, you want to be unforgettable?

375
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:36,709
You want to not be mousy?

376
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,684
You can't just change your hair.

377
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:41,145
You have to actually change.

378
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,634
I'm just saying.

379
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,340
Okay, I'm removing

380
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,187
the glass... very... slowly.

381
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,179
Okay, take this. Bovie.

382
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,428
Nice work, Dr. Bailey.

383
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,683
Dr. Warren, can you
believe that Dr. Bailey

384
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,170
almost left general
surgery for peds surgery?

385
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,025
Did you know that? I did not.

386
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,247
Yeah. No, she almost said
no to general surgery.

387
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:12,053
But then she thought about it,

388
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,236
and she changed her mind.

389
00:17:15,236 --> 00:17:17,439
She wasn't afraid to rethink her decision.

390
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,397
- She just needed to be asked again.
- I see.

391
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:23,878
Clearly.

392
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,238
Do you have my report thing?

393
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:33,304
No.

394
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:37,125
He took you in, he's given you money,

395
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,721
he flew you to L.A. He deserves to know.

396
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:41,391
So if you're not gonna tell him, I will.

397
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:44,064
You paged me? What's going on?

398
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,298
You paged him?

399
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,546
What's the matter?

400
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,932
Mark, she's...

401
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,732
I'm giving the baby up for adoption.

402
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:56,394
I'm not a mom. I'm not ready.

403
00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:59,101
And I want him to have good parents

404
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,418
and a good home.

405
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:01,769
No, don't. Don't do this.

406
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:04,099
- Don't give this baby away.
- They'll love him.

407
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,160
They'll love him more than I will.

408
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,250
Give him to me.

409
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,949
I'll take him. I'll adopt him.

410
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:17,417
I understand. I understand.
You're not ready, but I am.

411
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:20,641
And I know I... I don't
have the best track record,

412
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,904
and I... and I should've been
there for you, and I wasn't.

413
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:25,874
But I will be there for this baby. Please.

414
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,032
I want him to have a family. And, I mean,

415
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,101
you've been really nice to
me the past couple of months,

416
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:34,474
but you're not a family.
You're just a guy.

417
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,149
Sloan, please. I'll help.

418
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:39,569
Uh...

419
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,517
I'm right across the hall.

420
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,842
And we're a family, sort of.

421
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,185
And... we're doctors...

422
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:50,696
and we're best friends,

423
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,006
and... and we're good people.

424
00:18:56,571 --> 00:18:57,835
Yeah, we'll...

425
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:01,185
we'll take care of the baby, together.

426
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:04,342
We'll love him...

427
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:06,867
really well.

428
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,284
Just think about it.

429
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,613
Go home. We'll talk about it.

430
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,982
Can we talk about it?

431
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,836
Yes. Yes, we can.

432
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:22,379
We can talk about it.

433
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,995
Ooh, thank God. Where'd you get those?

434
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,548
Patient room. Guy's in a coma.

435
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,425
He's not gonna miss 'em. Anything happen?

436
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,110
He's still asleep,

437
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,123
but she wants to say something.

438
00:19:47,123 --> 00:19:49,226
Oh! Oh, my God. I'm starving.

439
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:50,728
Ew. These are all half-eaten.

440
00:19:50,728 --> 00:19:52,162
Now you can see what they are.

441
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:58,474
- What are we doing?
- Her boring husband's in surgery.

442
00:19:58,474 --> 00:19:59,151
This dude's been in love

443
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:01,627
- with her for 15 years.
- But she just found out,

444
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,451
so we're waiting to see
if she says something.

445
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,533
Or if her husband croaks.

446
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,962
But it's okay if he does,
because they're miserable.

447
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,695
I mean, is this what marriage turns into,

448
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:12,016
running out of things to
say and changing who you are?

449
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,528
- Probably.
- Yeah.

450
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:16,656
Well, I didn't marry Derek
to be the chief's arm candy.

451
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:19,445
- I'm a surgeon.
- Yeah, you married him for the great surgeries.

452
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:21,282
I didn't do that either.

453
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:22,200
- Right.
- You should've.

454
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,954
Ooh. Shh. She's gonna say something.

455
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:28,442
- She's gonna wake him up.
- Oh. What did she say?

456
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,569
She can't breathe. Get a crash cart.

457
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:55,034
- She's got a big air leak in her chest tube.
- What's happening?

458
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,915
Let's keep her on 100%
o-2 and get a bronchoscopy.

459
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,949
Grey, see if an O.R. is
available just in case.

460
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:02,253
Okay. She's having trouble breathing.

461
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:04,210
We'll let you know more as soon as we do.

462
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:08,015
We saved the arm. We
saved it. We're ready.

463
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,605
It's gonna have to be an amputation.

464
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,468
- What?
- There's too much

465
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,772
devascularized tissue,
too much contamination.

466
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,291
Or we can push antibiotics
and let the stump heal,

467
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,070
- but by that time...
- The arm will be dead.

468
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,756
Page me when he's awake. I'll tell him.

469
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:24,518
They... they can't just leave it behind.

470
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:27,222
We could move it somewhere else,
attach it to a healthy zone.

471
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:31,255
- Don't tell me, mouse.
- I'm... I'm just saying...

472
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,472
Temporary ectopic replantation!

473
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:38,601
Well, you have... you
have to keep the arm alive

474
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,102
until the stump heals.

475
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:42,950
Yes, but in cases involving the elbow...

476
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,665
It's extreme. He'll lose range
of motion, grip failure...

477
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:48,744
He'll keep his arm. He
deserves extreme measures.

478
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:52,325
If the arm is still viable,
you can't just let it die.

479
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,482
Has that ever been done
before, above the elbow?

480
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:56,517
I don't know, but it could be done.

481
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,030
You could implant onto the epigastric

482
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,724
and the, uh, vena commitante.

483
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:03,371
- Give you a few days for the stump to heal.
- I've never done one.

484
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,629
- Neither have I.
- So?

485
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:08,652
After today, you can't say that anymore.

486
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:11,798
Okay, come on. I told him that
we would do everything we could.

487
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,496
Do everything that we can.

488
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,134
I'll call Shepherd and let him know.

489
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:22,171
Grey, Avery, get ready to scrub in.

490
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,706
We're gonna be a while.

491
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:29,769
Okay, that?

492
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:31,220
Not mousy.

493
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:35,585
You going into surgery now?

494
00:22:35,585 --> 00:22:38,067
There's this, uh, breakfast.

495
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:39,619
I know. I know about the breakfast

496
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,337
because there's some
resident that I don't know

497
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:42,821
rooting through my closet right now.

498
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,326
Sorry. She's a little overeager.

499
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,072
I... I have a surgery,

500
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:47,554
and I can't really give up a surgery.

501
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,851
- No, I wouldn't want you to.
- I mean, just to smile

502
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:52,855
and stand at a podium for the suits?

503
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,207
It's...

504
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:56,734
No, you shouldn't come.

505
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:01,717
I... you know, my patient,
she's somebody's wife, too,

506
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:02,575
and I'm her doctor, and...

507
00:23:09,153 --> 00:23:11,210
- Okay?
- Okay.

508
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:15,076
Okay.

509
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:28,734
Hey.

510
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:32,856
Hey. I've got a tracheobronchial tear.

511
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:34,875
Transitory ectopic implantation.

512
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,500
Wow. Nice.

513
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:48,427
I rented a house. It's amazing.

514
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,991
It's right on the
water... a little cottage.

515
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:52,185
And there are deer... like "Bambi" deer...

516
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:53,397
and... and singing birds.

517
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,311
It's incredible.

518
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:02,625
I... I found this little
secret coffee place

519
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,799
down the street from here, and, uh...

520
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,254
And, oh, I... I was
thinking of getting a puppy.

521
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,031
But, you know, I... you
have to be home with a puppy,

522
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,178
and I... and I'm... and I'm always here.

523
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:16,663
So I... I went down to
the pound 'cause I... I...

524
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,133
I wanted to get it out of my system,

525
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,896
you know, the puppy love.

526
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:25,108
And I... I held all of
these incredibly sweet dogs,

527
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:28,087
and... you would've been really...

528
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,037
Really proud of me, Owen.

529
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,317
I didn't take one home.

530
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:35,389
I went out and got a fish instead.

531
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,470
Let me see. What else?
Oh, I got a bikini wax.

532
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,314
Yeah, I got a bikini... an actual wax.

533
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,482
You know, I haven't had
one of those since...

534
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:42,799
- you remember when I tried to wax myself...
- Okay,

535
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,468
all right, all right.
What... what is your point?

536
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:44,973
You were my best friend!

537
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,320
My best friend who I
could tell everything to.

538
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,903
And now you won't even look at me.

539
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,576
Yeah, 'cause you said you love me.

540
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,989
You said you loved me, too, and then...

541
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:09,285
and then you chose Yang.

542
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,190
You chose her, too. You chose her, too.

543
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,884
I feel like I'm cheating on her.

544
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,212
When I talk to you, I feel
like I'm cheating on her.

545
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:23,585
So I'm sorry.

546
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,482
And I miss my best friend, too.

547
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,329
Don't you have something else to do?

548
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:57,930
This is the closest I've been
to inside an O.R. in a week.

549
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,734
Last week, I would've
been paged in to help.

550
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:02,835
Now I'm paged about...

551
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,995
fund-raising brunches.

552
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,786
I'm adopting Sloan's baby.

553
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,285
It's the right thing to do. I think I can.

554
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:17,654
Mm-hmm. I certainly want to.

555
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,793
Callie said she'd help.

556
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,160
I'm having a baby.

557
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,704
Congratulations.

558
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:27,977
I'm happy for you.

559
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:31,465
I'm happy for you, too, chief.

560
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,191
It's what you always wanted, right?

561
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,645
Yep.

562
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:37,013
It's what I've always wanted.

563
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,052
How is he, Dr. Bailey?

564
00:26:40,052 --> 00:26:41,854
Looks like you're nearly done,

565
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:43,917
and it's just in time for dinner

566
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,567
and maybe even some dancing.

567
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:48,669
- If the patient looks good...
- He'll be just fine.

568
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,592
He won't be dancing anytime soon.

569
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:53,896
But when the time comes

570
00:26:53,896 --> 00:26:56,435
and he wants to go out dancing,

571
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,405
he will be perfectly capable

572
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,716
of making that determination himself,

573
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,169
without any help from anyone.

574
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:06,837
And I don't need any help here.

575
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:10,826
So if you are through
helping me, you can go.

576
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:12,126
- Well, I just thought that...
- Now.

577
00:27:12,126 --> 00:27:13,585
Mm.

578
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:17,544
She's nice...

579
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:18,816
- chatty...
- Stop talking.

580
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:21,798
To be fair, I never said
a word about dancing.

581
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:24,455
- Although...
- Shh. What is all this bleeding?

582
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,142
Ah.

583
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:30,096
Splenic artery's torn.

584
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:33,651
Oh, he's gonna lose this
spleen. Okay, lap pads.

585
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,322
Where's my patient?

586
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,597
No idea. He must have left.

587
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,033
I need help in here!

588
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:04,661
Ah. There you are.

589
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:05,980
I brought your wife's
clothes for the breakfast,

590
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,967
and I made note cards for

591
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:08,641
- your speech for this morning.
- Good. Go home.

592
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,821
You're here, I'm here.

593
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,437
Honestly, I'm happy to
help with this stuff.

594
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:12,893
You are? You want to be
an executive assistant?

595
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,124
You should want to do surgery.

596
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:16,666
- That's all I want to do.
- I'm not sure I can.

597
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:22,012
I... look, I'm grateful
that you hired me back.

598
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:24,946
It's just been easier to
help out with this stuff.

599
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:26,869
It's easier coming back as that

600
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,265
rather than coming back as the doctor

601
00:28:28,265 --> 00:28:30,393
who made a mistake and killed someone...

602
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:32,111
Killed someone's mom.

603
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,174
And I'm not sure I can be that person.

604
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:35,606
So if you're not sure that you need me,

605
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:37,204
then maybe I shouldn't be here.

606
00:28:37,204 --> 00:28:39,468
Dr. Shepherd, I have a
patient with an epidural bleed.

607
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,986
Come with me.

608
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,383
You couldn't do it?

609
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:56,368
Actually, we could.

610
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,991
But, um, you need to prepare yourself.

611
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:00,911
We needed to take some
extraordinary measures.

612
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:03,544
Your arm needed a blood
supply to keep it alive

613
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:04,933
until we could reattach it,

614
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,766
so we had to relocate it

615
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:08,949
to where we could get one.

616
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:17,655
Is that my arm?!

617
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,611
What did you do? Why
would you do this to me?

618
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:24,625
- What did you do to me?
- It's... it's only temporary.

619
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,085
Okay, it... it... just for a few days.

620
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:28,616
Frankie, this is what you wanted.

621
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,143
You... you wanted your arm.

622
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,843
In the right place!

623
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:34,454
I said I didn't want to be a freak.

624
00:29:34,454 --> 00:29:36,560
You shoulda left me like I was!

625
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,028
Oh, come on.

626
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,141
Did you even tell him you're leaving?

627
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,141
Look, I... I just wanted a place to stay

628
00:29:51,141 --> 00:29:52,233
and some money.

629
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:54,747
I mean, I didn't know he
was gonna care this much.

630
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:56,663
He bought a crib.

631
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:58,624
Well, he's a good man,

632
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,967
and he'll be very good to your baby.

633
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:02,670
You... you could know the
baby if Mark raised him.

634
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,745
You could come back and visit and...

635
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:06,171
I... I don't want to know
where to come back to.

636
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,664
I mean, if I give him to you guys,

637
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,436
it's still my baby,

638
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:12,961
and I need him to be somebody else's.

639
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,708
I mean, my dad got

640
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,614
a clean break from me...

641
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:20,915
And look at him now.

642
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:24,662
Don't I deserve that?

643
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,928
Prenatal vitamins are
not a joke. Take them.

644
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:37,801
And do not skip any doctor's appointments.

645
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:40,789
And... if you...

646
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:42,072
get into any trouble

647
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,658
or you have a problem with anything...

648
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,308
Call us.

649
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:51,764
Just...

650
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,481
take care of yourself.

651
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:56,437
Thanks.

652
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:06,986
Mrs. Banks.

653
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:08,585
How's my husband?

654
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:10,027
There's been some complications,

655
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:12,306
but Dr. Bailey is working very hard.

656
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:14,918
And I'll let you know
more as soon as I do.

657
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,071
I... is Emile still here?

658
00:31:18,603 --> 00:31:21,024
Emile is in surgery.

659
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,367
There's been some bleeding in his brain.

660
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:25,981
Oh, my God.

661
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:28,376
Oh, God.

662
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:35,056
He never said a word...

663
00:31:35,056 --> 00:31:38,382
for 15 years.

664
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:40,831
Did you know?

665
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:43,944
Why do you think I kept going back there?

666
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,381
But then I met Bob,

667
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:49,001
and... Emile never...

668
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,336
I made a choice.

669
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,459
But you kept going back.

670
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:56,910
I did...

671
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,776
because Bob liked it...

672
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,552
and I loved Bob.

673
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,220
It became our place.

674
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:09,368
And, yes, he orders for me,

675
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:12,945
because he knows what I like.

676
00:32:12,945 --> 00:32:17,874
And it may seem like we have
nothing left to talk about,

677
00:32:17,874 --> 00:32:21,274
but... sometimes it's
nice not to have to talk.

678
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,624
15 years ago...

679
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,784
I made a choice.

680
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:33,201
And I keep making it every day.

681
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,511
That's what marriage is.

682
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,694
There's a lot of damage to this pancreas.

683
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,788
I can't get this bleeding under control.

684
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,564
Okay, more suction, more.

685
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,512
The middle meningeal artery
is completely severed.

686
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:50,902
What did I miss?

687
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,844
I've... I've been literally
watching this guy all night.

688
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:53,816
- How could I have missed...
- You

689
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:55,540
didn't miss anything.
The first CT was negative.

690
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,841
There were no neurological symptoms.

691
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:58,978
It's the kind of bleed you never

692
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:01,463
- know about until it's too late.
- Is it too late?

693
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:04,111
I don't know yet. Bipolars.

694
00:33:04,111 --> 00:33:06,113
BP's 80 over 60 and falling.

695
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:09,227
- Push another atropine.
- Damn it.

696
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:10,817
Come on.

697
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,091
Damn it. Come on.

698
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:15,279
Stay with me now. Come on. Stay with me.

699
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,974
Come on. Stay with me.

700
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:20,418
Stay with me. Come on. Come on.

701
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:33,929
The dude waited on tables

702
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,892
and watched his life happen without him.

703
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:37,318
He's probably better off.

704
00:33:41,492 --> 00:33:42,565
I can't.

705
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:45,162
I can't do this. I can't just...

706
00:33:45,162 --> 00:33:47,745
I can't just watch people die.

707
00:33:47,745 --> 00:33:50,052
I can't.

708
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,367
I... I shouldn't have come back.

709
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,928
I... I...

710
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,201
Listen...

711
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,532
I made a mistake last year.

712
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,377
I almost walked away.

713
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,133
If you don't feel the losses...

714
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:11,443
if they don't hurt you

715
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:12,881
and humble you...

716
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,351
that's when you know

717
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,145
you're not cut out for this kind of work.

718
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:21,689
You can be a good surgeon, Kepner.

719
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:24,910
It's why I brought you back.

720
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:36,164
Congratulations. You know,
I thought we'd lost him,

721
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,405
- but you managed to...
- I can't talk to you.

722
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:40,618
Right. Um...

723
00:34:40,618 --> 00:34:42,591
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

724
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:44,122
I thought you and I might get to...

725
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:47,227
I can't talk to you. You make me nervous.

726
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:50,692
I... forget what I...

727
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:54,518
and I... say things I don't want to say.

728
00:34:54,518 --> 00:34:58,494
And I can't j... I just go stupid.

729
00:34:58,494 --> 00:34:59,932
I...

730
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:01,828
I like you. That's all. There.

731
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,651
All right.

732
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:06,691
And so if you want to go to dinner, fine.

733
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:10,497
- I will show up and try to talk.
- How's tomorrow night?

734
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:12,450
Fine. I might have surgery.

735
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,649
Well, I... I might join you.

736
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:18,042
How many stars you think you possess?

737
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:28,304
You can tell your patient
her husband's gonna be okay.

738
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:29,936
What about Emile?

739
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,666
Shepherd said there was no
way to know it was detectable

740
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:33,968
until it was too late.

741
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:34,775
Here.

742
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:38,570
I think this means you win.

743
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,408
I know. I don't want it.

744
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:43,399
Well, I don't want it either.
You would've won anyway.

745
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:45,054
You think?

746
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:47,452
Of course. That's her husband.

747
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:50,145
Grey. You ready to scrub in?

748
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:52,246
I have a valve replacement.

749
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,791
You know, I...

750
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,354
Yang is still here. Can she do it?

751
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,019
We have to keep reinventing ourselves...

752
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,627
almost every minute...

753
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,736
because the world can
change in an instant...

754
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,398
Hello, Mrs. Banks.

755
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:14,483
How's Emile doing?

756
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:16,627
I'm sorry.

757
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,730
We did everything we could,

758
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,763
but the bleeding in his
brain was too severe.

759
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:23,915
I'm very sorry.

760
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:27,794
Thank you.

761
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,947
And there's no time for looking back.

762
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,988
All those people out there,

763
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:05,357
they just want to stare at me.

764
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,811
They do. The doctors want to see you.

765
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:10,152
They want to ask you questions

766
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:13,846
because you're very rare...

767
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:15,164
and special.

768
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:17,081
And there might be press,

769
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,304
and there's a personal injury lawyer

770
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,459
floating around somewhere
that thinks that restaurant

771
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,797
might owe you a lot of money.

772
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:27,840
How much money?

773
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,074
Sometimes change is good, right?

774
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:30,968
Oh.

775
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:40,108
I don't believe you.

776
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,211
You don't have to do that.

777
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,351
I wanted to, before you got home.

778
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:47,674
And you don't have to do
what you offered to do.

779
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:50,123
- I'm not gonna hold you to that.
- Mark...

780
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:53,189
but thank you so much for offering.

781
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,309
And, uh...

782
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:58,543
it could be kinda great, right?

783
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:03,162
Sometimes the changes are forced on us...

784
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:12,021
What are you doing?

785
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,150
Sit down.

786
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:32,753
Sometimes they happen by accident...

787
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,540
Oh, get used to it. I'm keeping it.

788
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,921
You should. You're moving on.

789
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,018
I mean, I... I didn't
mean that was a bad thing.

790
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:46,076
It's what you should do.

791
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:48,386
I hate Valentine's day.

792
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:49,590
Me, too.

793
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,210
And we make the most of them.

794
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:10,588
Hey, Owen.

795
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:13,392
Hey. Hi. Uh, d... do you have a minute?

796
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,527
Oh, I'll... I'll wait in the car.

797
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:17,509
No, no, stay. It's...
it's... it's fine if you stay.

798
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,157
I said that I... I love you,

799
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,731
and it's out there, and I know
that I can't unring the bell.

800
00:39:22,731 --> 00:39:25,696
- But I'm... I'm unringing the bell. I... I take it back.
- I'm gonna go.

801
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,294
No, no, stay.

802
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:29,309
I miss my friend, Owen.

803
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:33,384
More than anything, I miss... my friend.

804
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:36,093
The rest I can deal with.
I can deal with it. It's...

805
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,498
I have a job that I love

806
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:41,957
and an amazing student to teach,

807
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:44,031
and I've got a... I've
got a cottage with deer

808
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:47,128
and a fish and various waxed body parts.

809
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,225
I'm gonna be fine.

810
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:54,234
You and I are gonna be friends.

811
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,852
And you're doing a valve
replacement with me in ten.

812
00:39:58,743 --> 00:39:59,665
Really?

813
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:02,232
Go prep 22-19.

814
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:04,545
Okay.

815
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:09,952
We have to constantly

816
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,138
come up with new ways to fix ourselves.

817
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,080
You can't unring the bell.

818
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,356
I know.

819
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:22,943
But I'm gonna try like hell.

820
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:26,828
So we change.

821
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:28,814
We adapt.

822
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,924
- Good to see you, Chief.
- Good to see you, too.

823
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:38,248
- Hey.
-Hi.

824
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:42,463
- Hey. You didn't have to come.
- I know I didn't. I chose to.

825
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:46,466
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

826
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,059
We create new versions of ourselves.

827
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:54,108
- Mrs. Shepherd?!
- I know.

828
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:56,045
- Mrs. Shepherd?
- I know.

829
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:58,582
I don't do brunches,

830
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:02,154
I don't miss surgeries, and
I don't do Valentine's day.

831
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:03,265
We just need to be sure

832
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:06,539
that this one is an
improvement over the last.

833
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,882
You're gonna have to make this
up to me with a lot of sex.

834
00:41:09,882 --> 00:41:11,087
Yes, dear.
