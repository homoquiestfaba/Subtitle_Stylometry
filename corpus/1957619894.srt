1
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:11,025
(tense eerie instrumental music)

2
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:46,189
- [Narrator] Our minds
are never repressed.

3
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,505
Our thoughts tumble between
the light and the darkness.

4
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:54,722
We have always preferred the
light and avoided the dark.

5
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,737
(tense eerie instrumental music)

6
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:17,915
- Something strange has been happening.

7
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:18,882
This voice,

8
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,035
I just can't get rid of this feeling.

9
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,585
(tense music)

10
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,174
I'm afraid.

11
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:31,652
I'm afraid.

12
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:34,202
(tense music)

13
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:41,467
Now, this is exactly what
I've been talking about, Phil.

14
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,260
I'm not some kind of a cirus act.

15
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,656
- I know, I know, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:47,335
- Yeah, people must let me
explain the scientific aspect

17
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,290
of what a gift like mine can mean,

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,901
the hundreds I can help.

19
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,072
- All right, I'll take care of it.

20
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,733
I'll have the mind reading
part removed immediately,

21
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:54,566
all right?

22
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:55,733
Don't worry about it.

23
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,340
- Okay.

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,890
(tense music)

25
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,987
(soft chattering)

26
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,852
- [Eerie Voice] Come to me, Gail.

27
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,606
- Ah, Dr. Peyton, you were very amusing.

28
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,363
May I have your autograph, please?

29
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:19,330
- Your time is up.
- Your autograph?

30
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:23,369
- [Eerie Voice] I want you to die.

31
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,761
- I'm sorry, but I must
insist that it's over today.

32
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:26,644
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,013
- [Man] Strange.

34
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,386
(eerie music)

35
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,715
- Something strange has been happening.

36
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,932
I don't know, it's just never
happened like this before.

37
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:53,471
I'm receiving thoughts.

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,333
It's like I hear a voice,

39
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,020
and it's so cold,

40
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,820
and I know it doesn't make sense,

41
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:07,114
but I feel it's evil.

42
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,033
I, I don't know, maybe, uh,

43
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,904
maybe it's because I'm
against this whole damn tour.

44
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:19,121
I just wish Phil hadn't
been so insistent about it.

45
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,249
But this voice,

46
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:28,452
I just can't get rid of this feeling.

47
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,156
I'm afraid.

48
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:38,691
I'm afraid that.

49
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,687
(clicks)

50
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:42,237
(tense music)

51
00:03:43,728 --> 00:03:46,645
(upbeat pop music)

52
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,707
- Gail,

53
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,463
you're so excitable sometimes.

54
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:14,882
Try to see this professionally.

55
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:16,642
It takes time to build a career.

56
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,147
- A career in what, a freak in a sideshow?

57
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:21,278
- I have not forgotten any
of the scientific aspect,

58
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,748
but first we have to build the awareness.

59
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:24,581
- Awareness?

60
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,540
Phil, I'm a psychologist,
I wanna help people.

61
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,026
- You will help people,
Gail, more than you think.

62
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:30,916
Trust me, okay?

63
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,039
- I do, but--

64
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,634
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, read my mind.

65
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:37,585
Nothing but good things in
store for you, lady, okay?

66
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:38,983
Now, come on, back to business.

67
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,785
- Oh, boy, you never stop working, do you?

68
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,518
- What, just doing my job.

69
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:45,335
45 minutes to press time, remember?

70
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,885
(tense music)

71
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,859
Now, just remember, keep
your answers short and sweet.

72
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,889
Don't get into any debates
about the meaning of life,

73
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,382
and don't go jabbering
on about nothing at all.

74
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,212
Just remember, you are
promoting yourself, right?

75
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,045
- Right.

76
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:04,878
- Good.

77
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,420
Now you get out there
and knock 'em dead, kid.

78
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,253
Come on.

79
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,553
(clapping)

80
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,793
- Good day to you all.

81
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:18,143
I'm Dr. Gail Peyton.

82
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,896
I'm ready for your questions.

83
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:20,729
Uh, yes?

84
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,646
- [Woman In Red] Dr. Peyton,
your book discusses your gift

85
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:26,083
of reading minds in
relation to helping patients

86
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,839
in psychoanalysis.

87
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,121
If that is true, do
you think it's ethical?

88
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,246
- I don't think it's like
wiretapping their minds,

89
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:35,307
if that's what you're getting at.

90
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:38,027
You really shouldn't call it mind reading.

91
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:41,230
I mean, if anything it's
more like mind listening.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,923
People who come to me want and need help.

93
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,956
The gift I have enables
me to cure them faster.

94
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,238
Yes?

95
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,526
- Yeah, I attended your
seminar this afternoon.

96
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:54,608
Isn't this just an elaborate parlor trick?

97
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,648
- I sometimes have wished
it was some kind of trick,

98
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,447
but I'm afraid not.

99
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:01,391
I live with this,

100
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,500
especially in my childhood
when I had to learn

101
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,906
how to control it.

102
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:06,393
- Ah, come on, Dr. Peyton,

103
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,970
you really expect us to fall for this?

104
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,228
Come on, lady, give me a break.

105
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:12,676
- No, this lady won't give you a break.

106
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:14,861
You sure haven't given me one.

107
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:16,081
- [Man Voiceover] That's impossible.

108
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,687
She couldn't have read my mind.

109
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:19,733
- Oh, and what is so impossible?

110
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:22,033
- Oh my God, she can do it.

111
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,612
(chuckles)

112
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,722
- Dr. Peyton, you've started a new book.

113
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,403
Could you tell us a little bit about it?

114
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:32,823
- Uh, no, I'm not--

115
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,068
- Yes, yes, she has.

116
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:36,802
Uh, I was out to LA recently.

117
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:39,457
Believe me, the Hollywood
minds are intriguing.

118
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:43,674
Let me tell you, no, no, you'd
better wait for the book.

119
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,106
- Well, now that you know.

120
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:53,770
- [Eerie Voice] Time to pay.

121
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,893
(tense music)

122
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:57,443
I want you to die.

123
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:00,559
Come to me.

124
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,764
(gasps)

125
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:05,668
- Are you all right?

126
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,412
- Oh, the voice, the voice was back.

127
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,919
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

128
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,091
Everything's gonna be all right.

129
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:12,189
- He wants to kill me.

130
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,237
- Who wants to kill you?

131
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,339
- No, no, it's all right,
it's just a slight trauma.

132
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:17,748
It's inherent to mind reading.

133
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,334
- I, I'm sorry.

134
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:20,501
- It's okay, honey.

135
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,459
Mind reading takes up a lot of energy.

136
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,264
Uh, come on, honey, I'll
take care of ya, don't worry.

137
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,672
I'm sorry, but that's gonna
have to be all for today.

138
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:28,555
Come on.

139
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:32,859
- Is this some kind of trick, or what?

140
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:42,306
(tense music)

141
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:48,540
- [Phil] Gail, I am glad
to see you lookin' better.

142
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,340
- Oh, I'm okay, Phil.

143
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,980
That voice.

144
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,510
- Oh, come on, Gail.

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,870
- No, I heard it in
the lobby this morning.

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,044
- Look, don't panic.

147
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,801
You're famous now, you're gonna be a star.

148
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:02,707
- I don't wanna be a star, you know that.

149
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,152
- Look, I've got great
things coming up for you.

150
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:05,985
Believe me.

151
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,275
This is good.

152
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,408
(soft radio chatter)

153
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:15,129
(upbeat rhythmic music)

154
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:24,232
- I'll be right back.

155
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:29,601
Can I get you anything else?

156
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:30,847
- [Phil] Where's the phone, please?

157
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:31,883
- Over on the bar.

158
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,218
- Thank you.

159
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:34,973
- And, uh, what about you, ma'am?

160
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:36,917
- I'll have another mineral water, please.

161
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,258
- Why don't you find
yourself a water fountain?

162
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,154
Uh, anything else?

163
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:42,444
- Yes, two lemons.

164
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:45,783
One lemon for me and put the
other one in a water fountain.

165
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,666
- Sure.

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,293
(upbeat rhythmic music)

167
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,733
- You are going to be very big, lady.

168
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,962
You'll never guess who I just rang up.

169
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,065
- Donahue, too.

170
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,046
- Yeah, Geraldo and
Donahue, can ya believe it?

171
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:19,629
I got you booked on both shows.

172
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,252
It's gonna be barrels of
money, barrels of money.

173
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,692
Donahue's people want you next week,

174
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:26,224
and I squeezed in Geraldo
while we're at the convention.

175
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey, come back here.

176
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,098
I've got a reporter from the
Times coming here tomorrow

177
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,156
at 10 o'clock.

178
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,393
It's big money, honey,
buy anything you want.

179
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,995
Come one, I'm a genius, aint' I?

180
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:36,828
- No.
- No?

181
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,645
- But I still like you.

182
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:41,339
Look, I'm sorry, Phil, but you know.

183
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:44,845
- I know, yeah, I'll get
ya some patients, too.

184
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:46,274
- I sure hope so.

185
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,796
- Come on, we got a lot to celebrate.

186
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:52,013
Hey, Tony, come on, a barrel
of your best champagne.

187
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,436
(slow tense music)

188
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:49,006
(sighs)

189
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,556
(tense music)

190
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:00,586
- [Eerie Voice] Gail.

191
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:01,469
I'm here.

192
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,639
(tense music)

193
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,238
No one can save you.

194
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,559
(tense music)

195
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,763
(elevator dings)

196
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,313
(tense music)

197
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:28,961
- Oh, uh, any messages for 1503, please?

198
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:30,947
Thank you.

199
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,230
- [Eerie Voice] Gail,

200
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,863
you can't get away.

201
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,714
- Oh, uh, where's the house phone, please?

202
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:42,597
Thank you.

203
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:45,984
(tense music)

204
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,164
Uh, 1504, please.

205
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,537
Come on, Phil, pick up.

206
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:56,825
- [Eerie Voice] I want you to die

207
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,375
slow and painful.

208
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:00,806
- Oh, oh!

209
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:03,878
Oh.

210
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,848
- Are you all right, ma'am?

211
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:08,828
- That man, did, did you see him?

212
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,593
- Are you sure you're okay?

213
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:12,810
(gasping)

214
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,721
- Oh, you, you, you've got to help me.

215
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,340
Someone is trying to kill me.

216
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,401
- Calm down, Miss, calm down.

217
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,964
- Stop him, please.

218
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,458
- Who, who is it?

219
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:29,096
- He's here, he's in the hotel.

220
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,910
I heard him.

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,358
He's following me.

222
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,375
- Okay, show me the man, lady.

223
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:37,731
- Hey, hey, hey, this
lady is the mind reader.

224
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,626
- Ah, is this a publicity thing, ma'am.

225
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,842
- No, for God's sake, it's true.

226
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,225
I read his mind.

227
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,070
You've got to believe me.

228
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,332
- (chuckles) Right, I believe you.

229
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:55,159
I'm going to arrest someone
because you read his mind.

230
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:58,623
Look, lady, go find someone
else for your publicity stunt.

231
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,336
- No.
- And don't bother me.

232
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,696
Come on.
- No.

233
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,349
- [Eerie Voice] Come to me, Gail.

234
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,431
- No.

235
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,231
- Die.
- No, stop it!

236
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:11,962
Oh, please help me, he's here, I know it!

237
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:14,110
- Lady, stop playing games.

238
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,228
- I'm not playing games.

239
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,276
Help me.

240
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:19,920
- Look, lady, come on, I'm
gonna take you to your room.

241
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,541
- No, no.
- Come on.

242
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,974
- No, no.
- Come on.

243
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,243
- Phil, Phil, Phil, I
heard the voice again.

244
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:26,470
- It's, it's all right.
- They don't believe me.

245
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,323
They don't.
- It's all right.

246
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,897
- You do, don't you, Phil, you believe me?

247
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:31,039
- Everything's gonna be all
right, just relax, honey,

248
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,360
just relax, please.

249
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,454
Uh, thank you, sir, I'll take care of her.

250
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:35,574
Come on, let's go.

251
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:36,774
- Phil, he wants to kill me.

252
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:37,633
- Sure.

253
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,814
- Wait, you don't believe
me either, do you?

254
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:41,898
- Gail, when are you gonna
start acting like a pro?

255
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:43,201
You need to rest, come on.

256
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:45,234
- Listen, you think I'm nuts.

257
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,607
You do, don't deny it.

258
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:48,189
- Of course I believe
you and I wanna help you,

259
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,722
but first you've gotta
get hold of yourself.

260
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:51,857
- I, I have got ahold of myself, damn it!

261
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,698
- Okay, okay, okay.

262
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,007
We just better stay in tonight.

263
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,919
- No, I don't, I gotta get outta here.

264
00:13:57,969 --> 00:13:59,654
God, they're all staring at me.

265
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,035
- All right, all right,
don't worry about it.

266
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,549
Look, I, I just got one more
call to make, all right?

267
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,472
- Oh, please hurry.

268
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:06,388
(tense music)

269
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:08,016
- Gail.
- There, there he is!

270
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:09,050
- [Phil] What's the matter?

271
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,883
- He's gone.

272
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:10,787
- Who's gone, what?

273
00:14:10,837 --> 00:14:12,033
- That, that's him, that had to be him.

274
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,207
He keeps staring at me.

275
00:14:13,257 --> 00:14:14,929
- Of course, you're a famous person.

276
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,125
- No, he's dangerous.

277
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,112
- Did you read his mind?

278
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,954
- Yes, no, I don't know!

279
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:20,491
- Oh, yes, I'm holding.

280
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,250
Gail, I've got Psychology Today on--

281
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,083
- Come on!

282
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:23,916
- All right.

283
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:27,808
Yes, no, no, no, no
problem, I'll call him back.

284
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,405
Jerk, what's he doing
at a meeting this hour?

285
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,054
Look, are you sure you
still wanna go to dinner?

286
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,477
- Yes, yes, come on, I gotta

287
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:33,611
get outta here!
- All right, all right, relax,

288
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:35,670
relax, now you go get us a cab.

289
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,590
While you're doing that I
got just one more quick call

290
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,758
to make, please, no, no.
- Come on.

291
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:41,320
- Go get the cab, go get the cab.

292
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,203
- Oh!

293
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,699
(tense music)

294
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,803
- [Eerie Voice] No one can save you.

295
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:01,148
- No, you're frightening me.

296
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,754
- [Eerie Voice] Gail, you can't

297
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,842
get away.
- No, no.

298
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:08,392
(tense music)

299
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,688
- [Eerie Voice] I'm here.

300
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:37,238
(tense music)

301
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,547
(gasps)

302
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:44,097
(tense music)

303
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,871
Your time is up.

304
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,315
(screams)

305
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,532
(gasping)

306
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,923
- Oh God.

307
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,610
- Gail!
(screams)

308
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,443
Where have ya been?

309
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,741
I've been looking all over for you.

310
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,808
- Phil, he's following me!

311
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,963
- I told you to get us a cab.

312
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,185
You should've listened to me.

313
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,393
- God, I'm scared!

314
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,823
He's after me!
- Why didn't you wait, dammit?

315
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:19,170
- You've gotta believe me!

316
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,566
- I'm taking you back to the hotel.

317
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:22,674
You'll feel a lot better there.

318
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,218
- No one believes me.

319
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:25,951
- It's okay, Gail, I believe you.

320
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,610
I'll call the authorities.

321
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,706
You're with me now.

322
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:31,215
Everything's gonna be just fine.

323
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,682
(crying)
Come on, come on.

324
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,232
(tense music)

325
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,740
- Excuse me, sir.

326
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,702
You have a message.

327
00:16:45,752 --> 00:16:46,535
- Oh, thank you.

328
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,450
- You're welcome.

329
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,407
- What is it?

330
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,276
(tense chiming music)

331
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,900
We told you we're not interested?

332
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,907
It's neither Donahue or Geraldo.

333
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,824
You've been leading me on.

334
00:16:57,874 --> 00:17:00,295
- Those jerks, they don't
understand your gift.

335
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,838
Look, go upstairs, I'll
meet you in the room

336
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,046
in a couple of minutes,
we'll talk about it.

337
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,179
I've gotta call 'em back.

338
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,286
(tense music)

339
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:12,933
- Oh, Dr. Peyton.
- Dr. Peyton,

340
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,690
could we have an autograph now, please,

341
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,700
and, and a picture?

342
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,533
- Sure.

343
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,366
- Oh, thank you.

344
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,132
Get together, get together, that's good.

345
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,624
Big smile, big smile.

346
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,457
(camera clicks)

347
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,451
Good, thank you very much.
- Sure.

348
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,265
- It's very nice of you.
- You're welcome.

349
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,287
(elevator dings)

350
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,837
(tense music)

351
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:35,813
- [Eerie Voice] Come to me.

352
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,030
- Who are you?

353
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:39,050
Where are you?

354
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:43,269
(tense music)

355
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,902
- Time to pay.
- No!

356
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:47,933
No.

357
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,483
(tense music)

358
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,334
- [Eerie Voice] Die.

359
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:04,134
(screams)

360
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,364
Burn in hell.
- Stop it!

361
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,486
Get away from me!
- Devil's disciple.

362
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,074
God will punish you!
- Help, help,

363
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:12,008
please someone help me!
- He punishes all sinners!

364
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,641
Sinners shall burn.

365
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,162
- Gail, Gail!

366
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,872
(crying)

367
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,491
Come on, Gail, you all right?

368
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:20,663
Get him outta here!

369
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,471
It's all right, it's all
right, they've got him now.

370
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:23,592
They've got him now, look at me.

371
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:24,515
- Who is he?

372
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,620
Why would he wanna hurt me?

373
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,618
- Who knows?

374
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,600
There are all kinds of
crazy people running around.

375
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,359
- I, I told you he was after me.

376
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,326
I told you.

377
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:35,910
- Thank you.
- I should've listened to you,

378
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,897
Dr. Peyton.

379
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:37,839
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:38,937
- That's all right.

381
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:40,126
Come on, let's go to the room.

382
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,823
Send a doctor to her
room right away, please.

383
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:43,805
- Right away, sir.

384
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,662
(crying)

385
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:48,212
(tense music)

386
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:52,566
- That'll help you relax.

387
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,138
- Thanks for coming, Doctor.

388
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,209
- You take it easy now.

389
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,366
If you need anything, call me.

390
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,833
- I will, thanks.

391
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,338
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.

392
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,145
You don't have to stay, I'll be fine.

393
00:19:05,195 --> 00:19:06,181
- Oh, it's all right.

394
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:09,473
I'll stay until you get to sleep.

395
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,306
- Phil.

396
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:11,292
- Yeah?

397
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:14,136
- You know, about those TV shows,

398
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,357
I'm kinda glad they aren't gonna happen.

399
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:17,651
Now I can go home.

400
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,038
- I know, you've said that before,

401
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,751
but something will work out,
I'll make a couple of calls.

402
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,783
- No, no, I really wanna go home.

403
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:26,886
- Don't you worry, you
just get some sleep.

404
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,853
- You're sweet, thanks.

405
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:32,455
- I'll take care of everything.

406
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,338
(soft TV chatter)

407
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,208
(tense music)

408
00:19:57,622 --> 00:20:00,629
- [Eerie Voice] Come to me, Gail.

409
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,179
(tense music)

410
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,458
I want you to die.

411
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:10,046
(tense music)

412
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,487
Slow and painful.

413
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,076
- (gasps) Phil, is that you?

414
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,234
- Yes.

415
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:27,117
- Oh, God.

416
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:31,161
Thank God, I must've been dreaming.

417
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:34,053
I could still hear him, I mean,

418
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:35,037
it's funny, isn't it?

419
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:38,293
I know he's gone, but I can hear him.

420
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:40,426
- Because I'm still here.

421
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,353
I didn't go away.

422
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:45,903
(tense music)

423
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,498
- Phil?

424
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,164
- You should've listened to me.

425
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,964
You should've gone straight to your room.

426
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:58,847
- Phil?

427
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:02,338
- You didn't listen to me.

428
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:03,799
- [Gail] Phil?

429
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:06,016
(screams)

430
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:12,322
(slow tense music)

431
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,697
- Yes, Inspector Thorne, please.

432
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,497
Yes, Dr. Xavier Dark.

433
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,104
Yes, I'll hold.

434
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:34,071
(slow tense music)

435
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:42,572
- [Man] Hello, this is Inspector Thorne.

436
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:45,289
- Inspector Thorne, Xavier Dark.

437
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:49,491
I went through her things.

438
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,534
- [Thorne] Anything that
might help us, Doctor?

439
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,918
I don't believe in clairvoyants.

440
00:21:53,968 --> 00:21:57,044
Do you really believe
she could read minds?

441
00:21:57,094 --> 00:22:01,010
- Her extrasensory
perception was remarkable,

442
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,893
truly an amazing gift.

443
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:05,175
Gail was

444
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,767
something special.

445
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:13,245
She was not only my colleague,
but a patient as well.

446
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:16,121
- [Thorne] Did you understand her tape?

447
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,004
- Yes.

448
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:22,678
Strange, in our last
session she told me about

449
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:26,036
her dreams, about going on tour,

450
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,169
and about being murdered.

451
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:33,301
It seems her dreams were self-prophetic.

452
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,851
She saw and knew her murderer.

453
00:22:37,178 --> 00:22:39,919
- [Thorne] Doctor, you may not know it,

454
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,592
but you've done a great
service to her memory.

455
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:45,031
- In what way, Inspector Thorne?

456
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,158
- [Thorne] Everything on that
tape about her dream happened.

457
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,694
The only thing that the local
police had no idea about

458
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,994
was who killed Gail Peyton.

459
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,850
- You should've listened to me.

460
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,176
- Since you know the killer,

461
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:00,902
why don't you just go and arrest him?

462
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:03,555
- [Thorne] Doctor, you must realize

463
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,522
we need more than a nightmare
to convict a killer,

464
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:07,755
much more.

465
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,302
Goodbye, Doctor.

466
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,185
(dial tone rings)

467
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:23,015
- This case of the young boy is mystifying

468
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,648
if anything at all.

469
00:23:25,686 --> 00:23:27,239
The way he tells me his dream,

470
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,667
I'm beginning to believe it myself.

471
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:33,921
I don't really know where
to begin except to start

472
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,888
where his dream starts.

473
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:39,096
The strangest thing is
that it doesn't even appear

474
00:23:39,146 --> 00:23:40,257
to be his dream .

475
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,367
(yells)
(tense music)

476
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:46,443
He starts with a couple
and a broken down car

477
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,576
in the middle of nowhere.

478
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,142
- Now you stay here and watch the car.

479
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,450
- You want me to stay here and melt?

480
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,696
Forget it, I'm not stayin' here alone.

481
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:59,435
- Maggie, somebody has to
stay here and watch the car!

482
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:02,735
(tense rhythmic music)

483
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,153
- You and your damn shortcuts.

484
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:09,217
I swear my mama was right about you.

485
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,317
Everything you touch turns into failure.

486
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,534
- I said stay!

487
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:14,607
Oh.

488
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:19,899
- How do you expect to get
us out of here, smart guy?

489
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,504
- Will you just shut your trap?

490
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,114
- Shut your own trap.

491
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,181
You're never gonna amount to anything.

492
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,439
You've been a failure since your birth.

493
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:29,275
- I should've left ya in
the lousy little suburbs.

494
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:30,498
I know that now.

495
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:31,707
And ya know why?

496
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:33,427
Because that's where ya really belong.

497
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:36,042
- And you're, you're a hustler.

498
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:37,702
- Will you shut up?

499
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:38,847
Please!

500
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:42,730
(slow rhythmic country music)

501
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:49,787
Hello?

502
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,740
Anybody home?
(banging)

503
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,237
- This must be one of
those fantastic hotels

504
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,787
you told me about.

505
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:01,180
(insects chirp)

506
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:03,462
- Hello!

507
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:06,012
Anybody here?

508
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:08,707
(tense music)

509
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,590
Hello?

510
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:14,318
Anybody here?

511
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:19,024
(soft rhythmic country music)

512
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,942
Good day to ya, sir.

513
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,224
- Ah good day it is, son.

514
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:32,079
And one of the hottest in
my 80 years of this life.

515
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,079
- No, it sure couldn't get
any hotter if it tried.

516
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:36,939
Listen, my car broke
down up the road a ways,

517
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,335
and I'm lookin' for either
a phone or a gas station.

518
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:42,661
- Well, ya ain't gonna
find either one today.

519
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,518
My name's Marion.

520
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:46,508
What's yours, young man?

521
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:47,472
- Hi.

522
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,189
- Bart, Bart Carlin.

523
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,998
This here's Maggie.

524
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,475
- Thanks for the water, um,
could we have some more?

525
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:57,192
- Oh, help yourself.

526
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:01,344
What ya doin' up this way?

527
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,585
You sure ain't dressed for huntin' season.

528
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:08,302
(slow tense rhythmic music)

529
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,661
There's many things the Lord gives ya

530
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,968
after he takes your eyesight.

531
00:26:14,018 --> 00:26:18,345
For one thing, he gives
ya more common sense.

532
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:20,501
(chuckles)

533
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,931
- How long you been livin'
around here, old man?

534
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,924
- [Marion] Well, I was
born here in these swamps.

535
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,942
I haven't left 'em since.

536
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,412
- You've never been into a town or city?

537
00:26:30,462 --> 00:26:33,006
- [Marion] Never had need to, Lady.

538
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:34,489
- Well, you wouldn't happen
to know if there's a phone

539
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,039
around here, would ya?

540
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:36,922
- Oh, no.

541
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,297
I heard about them new phone things.

542
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:42,368
You talk in one end,

543
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:44,193
and someone hears ya out the other.

544
00:26:44,243 --> 00:26:47,158
No, I'd rather talk to a man face to face.

545
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:50,126
- Well, I hate to see what'd
happen if you got sick.

546
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,584
Anyway, you take care of yourself.

547
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,384
It's nice talkin' to ya, old man.

548
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:59,998
- Oh no, so we're back
on our hike to nowhere.

549
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:01,927
- Master, Master, we
need your help, Master!

550
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,464
We need your help!

551
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:06,014
(tense music)

552
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:10,429
We need your help, Master!

553
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:13,076
Come on, please, please,
please, come on, please!

554
00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:15,168
Come on, come on!

555
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,348
(tense music)

556
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:18,791
- [Marion] Quiet, boy, quiet!

557
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,314
- She fell into the creek
and was pulled under.

558
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:22,663
Please, Marion.

559
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:25,433
- Ah, I'm sorry, Mister, she's dead.

560
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,815
- Please, Marion.

561
00:27:26,865 --> 00:27:29,085
It ain't her time yet, it just ain't.

562
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:32,153
- All right, put her down, put her down.

563
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:35,733
Let her body feel the
strength of Mother Earth.

564
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:37,063
- [Maggie] The girl is dead.

565
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,634
Don't prolong this man's misery.

566
00:27:38,684 --> 00:27:39,517
- Earth,

567
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,475
air,

568
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:45,018
spirits of the universe!

569
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:47,901
Oh, Lord, bring the power unto me!

570
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:52,705
(tense music)

571
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,968
(pulsating ringing)

572
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:19,009
(mystical music)

573
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,476
- Baby!

574
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:22,709
Baby, my little girl!

575
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:24,842
(crying)

576
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,950
My little girl.

577
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,345
- You all right, old man?

578
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:30,632
- Yeah.

579
00:28:30,682 --> 00:28:32,138
(crying)

580
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,133
- This is not possible.

581
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:37,100
(slow tense music)

582
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,124
Hey, does he always get
so exhausted afterward?

583
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,552
- No, people used to come for miles

584
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,076
for the touch of healin'.

585
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,069
Please, Master, eat.

586
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,298
- [Marion] Not now, dear boy, not now.

587
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,156
You better stay close.

588
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:56,706
Your time will be comin' soon.

589
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,483
- Eat, please.

590
00:28:58,533 --> 00:28:59,603
- Hey, Gus, you wouldn't happen to know

591
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,117
of a phone around here, would you?

592
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,434
- Phone, what's that?

593
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:03,931
- I, I'm sorry, my friend.

594
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,584
I know I'm not much of a host,

595
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,943
but I do hope you enjoy this

596
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:09,778
small meal.

597
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:11,626
- Oh no, Marion, you
shouldn't, uh, really.

598
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:13,258
- Looks good, uh, can I?

599
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:15,375
- Oh, help yourself.

600
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:16,258
- Shut up!

601
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:22,581
Marion, that girl, she
was dead, and I saw that.

602
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:27,058
I don't understand it,
but I saw it, Marion.

603
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,191
She was dead.

604
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:34,790
- Care for something to wet your whistle?

605
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:39,039
Uh, don't, don't forget I'm blind, boy.

606
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,048
Close the door.

607
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:44,962
Mosquitoes are quite hungry,
especially for young blood.

608
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:48,520
- I could go for a shot there, Marion.

609
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,303
Thank you.
- How 'bout you, Maggie?

610
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:52,033
- Oh, no thanks, Marion.

611
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,937
You know, you could be a rich man.

612
00:29:54,987 --> 00:29:57,868
- Well, I'm doin' all I can, ma'am.

613
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,451
To you, my friends.

614
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,334
- Yeah.

615
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:04,372
(coughing)

616
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:08,583
What the hell is this, Marion?

617
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:12,038
(slow tense music)

618
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:15,520
- Marion, tell me how you do it.

619
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,582
- Oh, it's simple, even you can make it.

620
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:21,998
- No, Marion, what she's
talkin' about is how you did it,

621
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:24,505
how you brought back
life to that little girl.

622
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,638
- Oh, you mean the touch.

623
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,500
Well, when I was a boy, about his age,

624
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:35,265
the touch was passed on to me,

625
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:37,982
just like I will pass it on to the boy.

626
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:39,616
Right?

627
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:43,083
Just like it's been done for 2,000 years.

628
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:46,073
- It's time to go, Master.

629
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,682
- Ah.

630
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:51,479
- Little girl has really
tired me out tonight.

631
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,828
- A lot of people have
travelled great distances

632
00:30:53,878 --> 00:30:55,058
to come here, Master.

633
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,202
- Oh, you're right, boy.

634
00:30:57,252 --> 00:31:01,682
We mustn't disappoint those
who have been hoping so long.

635
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,609
Come, friends.

636
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,410
Come and witness the power of the touch.

637
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,793
(gentle rhythmic music)

638
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,979
A good evening to you all.

639
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:36,040
(gentle rhythmic music)

640
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,102
Thank you, boy.

641
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:38,985
All right.

642
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,563
I can see we got a load
of healin' work to do.

643
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:48,595
Lord,

644
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,949
we are here to heal your children.

645
00:31:53,932 --> 00:31:57,765
They hurt from the pain
of bein' mortal, Lord.

646
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:02,969
Give me the power to take their pain away.

647
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,608
Give me the power to heal.

648
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:08,991
(gentle rhythmic music)

649
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,636
Let the touch heal.

650
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,663
(solemn rhythmic music)

651
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:40,251
- This guy has gold in his hands, Bart.

652
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:43,634
(solemn rhythmic music)

653
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:01,713
(clattering)

654
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:03,051
(chuckles)

655
00:33:03,101 --> 00:33:04,579
- This is impossible.

656
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,703
- It's incredible.

657
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:06,697
- Impossible.

658
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:08,344
- It's incredible.

659
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:12,561
(chuckles)
(solemn rhythmic music)

660
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:23,810
- Come on, Maggie, let's
get a ride with one of them.

661
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,755
- And miss this opportunity?

662
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:27,888
We have to work this out.

663
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,676
- Better stay close, boy.

664
00:33:31,726 --> 00:33:33,709
Your time will be comin' soon.

665
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,579
- What exactly does that mean, Marion?

666
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:37,241
His time will be comin' soon.

667
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:41,224
- Well, my days are endin', my friends.

668
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:45,441
Soon it will be my time to
pass the touch on to the boy,

669
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:51,251
and he will have the power
to heal the many who need it.

670
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:54,956
Come, let's go home and get some rest.

671
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:57,048
- Um, the boy is much too young.

672
00:33:57,098 --> 00:33:59,365
I mean, don't you realize
what you have here?

673
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:01,186
The millions that you can be makin'

674
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:03,481
instead of wastin' your
time in these back swamps.

675
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:04,827
- Yeah, she's right, Marion.

676
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,783
This power you have, it's just incredible.

677
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,842
We could set up some sort
of a clinic or somethin'.

678
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,007
People would flock to this thing

679
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:11,402
from all--
- Ah, no, no.

680
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:14,492
- Marion, you gotta consider
how much you could help

681
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:18,073
these poor people and we
can organize that for you.

682
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,340
- You better get some rest yourselves.

683
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,414
(slow rhythmic music)

684
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:27,955
- Oh, honey, just think of
all the money we can make.

685
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,494
- You're right, you're damn right.

686
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:31,420
- We've just gotta make
him see it our way.

687
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,700
Just think of it,
mansions, airplanes, limos.

688
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,234
Oh, Bart, we just gotta get a limo!

689
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,067
- Yeah.

690
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:40,654
- Oh, yeah.

691
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:43,871
(slow rhythmic music)

692
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:48,719
(coughing)

693
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:49,602
- Gus.

694
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:52,654
Gus.

695
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:55,661
Gus.

696
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,515
- Don't worry, I'll take him into it.

697
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,272
Some fresh squeezed orange juice

698
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,420
and egg in the mornin',

699
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,799
that's all it takes to gain a man.

700
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:11,682
- Gus!

701
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:14,302
(coughing)

702
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:15,185
Gus!

703
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:18,585
- [Bart] It's okay, Marion, we're here.

704
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:19,795
- Oh, Gus!

705
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:22,587
- [Maggie] I made ya
some fresh brewed coffee.

706
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:23,804
- Oh, the boy,

707
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,913
please, bring me the boy.

708
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:32,209
- Bart, this is our chance.

709
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:33,042
- Gus.

710
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:35,052
- Just think what we
can do with this power,

711
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:36,230
just do it.

712
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,113
Come on.

713
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:41,584
- [Bart] I don't know
where the boy is, Marion.

714
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:42,442
What's wrong?

715
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:45,000
- The boy, I need Gus.

716
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:45,887
- [Bart] No, no, look,

717
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,506
it's gonna be all right.
- Gus!

718
00:35:47,556 --> 00:35:49,401
- I'll go and get him.

719
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,701
(tense rhythmic music)

720
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:54,813
Gus!

721
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,380
Gus, Marion needs ya!

722
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,090
(tense rhythmic music)

723
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,973
Gus!

724
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,555
- Thanks for your help.

725
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:05,103
You're good people.

726
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:06,958
- You're welcome, old man.

727
00:36:07,008 --> 00:36:09,875
Listen, why don't ya
give that touch to me?

728
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:11,972
Gus is much too young.

729
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:13,134
Give the touch to me,

730
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,064
old man.
- No, the boy must be the one.

731
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,997
The touch must heal.

732
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:21,297
(tense rhythmic music)

733
00:36:27,191 --> 00:36:28,175
- I don't see him.

734
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:29,311
(Marion moans)

735
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,706
I, I tripped.

736
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:33,690
- The boy, I need the boy.

737
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,384
- I will heal the sick, old man.

738
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:37,741
I will help you out, give me the touch.

739
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,186
- Swear.

740
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:42,889
Swear it to me that you will
help the sick and the poor.

741
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:46,022
- I swear it, old man, I swear it.

742
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:48,447
I will help you out, give me the touch.

743
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,747
(tense rhythmic music)

744
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
- This gift,

745
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,146
the gift of the touch,

746
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,747
it shall pass from teacher to student.

747
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:07,197
You shall pass it on when your time comes.

748
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,486
Swear to me that it shall be done.

749
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:11,944
- No, let go of my hands, they're burning!

750
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,580
- Swear it to me!

751
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,375
- Swear it, damn it!

752
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:17,869
- Oh, God, I swear it!

753
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,800
(tense music)

754
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,662
- You got it!

755
00:37:20,712 --> 00:37:21,495
You okay?

756
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:23,295
- They're burning, they're burning.

757
00:37:23,345 --> 00:37:24,718
- It hurts.

758
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:26,200
(tense music)

759
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,033
We did it!

760
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,333
We did it, we did it, whoa!

761
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,735
We did it, come on, come
on, let's get outta here!

762
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:37,035
(tense rhythmic music)

763
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,924
- I don't have time for this nonsense.

764
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:50,757
- Sit down.

765
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,124
Ramsey screen it.

766
00:37:52,174 --> 00:37:54,674
It's supposed to be fantastic.

767
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,952
- All right, um, why don't
you two just have a seat?

768
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:04,820
I'll be right with you, okay?

769
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,289
Now, don't you worry.

770
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:09,702
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

771
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,468
Gentlemen, what I am about to show you

772
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:15,962
is, by no other explanation, a miracle.

773
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:17,393
(chuckles)

774
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:20,391
- Dr. Ramsey, with all due respect, sir,

775
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:23,115
we do not believe in miracles.

776
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:25,332
- Gentlemen, wait and see.

777
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:29,949
This patient has been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

778
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:32,689
The primary mass is formed in the colon.

779
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:34,475
His kidneys are failing.

780
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,169
Further medical intervention
is out of the question,

781
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,085
except to make his short time left

782
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:41,494
as comfortable as possible.

783
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:43,377
Mr. Carlin, you ready?

784
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,615
Nurse, the curtain, please.

785
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:53,370
Nurse, could you close the
curtain, please, quickly?

786
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,689
Gentlemen, this is Mr. Bart Carlin.

787
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,624
He is going to attempt a miracle.

788
00:38:57,674 --> 00:38:59,880
He is going to cure the patient.

789
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,180
(tense rhythmic music)

790
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:31,665
(mystical music)

791
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:33,853
Thank you, Bart.

792
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:36,375
Could you have a seat, please?

793
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,692
(tense rhythmic music)

794
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,575
- So, how do you feel?

795
00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:42,915
- Better, I never felt better.

796
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:47,068
- His records can be verified, of course.

797
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:50,098
- [Doctor] I would like to
see a complete lab analysis.

798
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:51,632
- Of course.

799
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,701
- This is amazing, Doctor.

800
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:55,514
I would've sworn that
this patient suffered from

801
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:57,055
poor blood circulation.

802
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,758
- [Dr. Ramsey] He did, over
60% his arteries were clogged.

803
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:03,180
- Did you see the color of his skin?

804
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,696
It's impossible.

805
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:07,076
- Ah, that's what makes it most exciting.

806
00:40:07,126 --> 00:40:10,895
By all rights, this man
was a walking corpse.

807
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:14,195
(tense rhythmic music)

808
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,493
(soft chattering)

809
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,072
(knocking)

810
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:29,420
- We quit!

811
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,588
(chuckles)

812
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,433
- What, what's going on here?

813
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:35,167
- Well, it's like this, Dr. Ramsey.

814
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,650
I've been working for you
and this medical institution

815
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,194
for what, two months now?

816
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:41,661
And everyone of the
patients that I've cured

817
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:44,168
have been probed and
studied by your doctors.

818
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:46,735
Now, cured is the key word here, Ramsey.

819
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,293
- Look at all this crap.

820
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:50,925
None of these fancy degrees
can do what Bart can do

821
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:52,718
with just his touch.

822
00:40:52,768 --> 00:40:55,969
- No, I don't have that gift
of healing that you have.

823
00:40:56,019 --> 00:40:58,850
- Ha, you can't even
call yourself a healer.

824
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,861
Not when I'm in the same room.

825
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,797
- Sure, every AIDS and cancer
patient in our hospital

826
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:05,390
is cured by your hands.

827
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,209
Your gift is doing lots of good here.

828
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:10,464
- Exactly, I've been healin'
a lot of people in this place

829
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:11,538
for a long time.

830
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,154
Where has it gotten me?

831
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,303
- You've been paid.

832
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:16,055
You've been paid very well.

833
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,193
- Paid well, Ramsey?

834
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,909
And who's gettin' the big bucks here, huh?

835
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:23,217
- All right, how much do ya want?

836
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:26,234
(chuckles)

837
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,089
- You ever heard of the
Medical Corporation?

838
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:31,693
- [Dr. Ramsey] Yes, they
own hospitals and clinics,

839
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:34,261
a sort of General Motors in hospital care.

840
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:37,304
- They've offered us six
million, excluding benefits,

841
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:40,509
excluding bonuses, plus our own clinic.

842
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,807
Can you beat that?

843
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:45,271
The Bart Carlin Clinic.

844
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:47,490
I like the sound of that.

845
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,373
- So do I, so we quit.

846
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:53,545
Unless of course you can
make us a better offer.

847
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,595
- You have a great gift.

848
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,920
Don't whore it.

849
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,504
- Oh (sighs).

850
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,971
(door thuds)

851
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:14,398
(soft chattering)

852
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,762
- [Man] As chairman of the board

853
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:28,658
for the Medical Corporation,

854
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:33,109
I personally wish to
congratulate Mr. Bart Carlin.

855
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,818
It is my pleasure to declare
the Bart Carlin Clinic

856
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:37,501
officially open.

857
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,446
Bart.

858
00:42:38,496 --> 00:42:40,746
(clapping)

859
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,057
- Today marks the beginning of
a new era in world medicine.

860
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:53,856
The Bart Carlin Clinic will change

861
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:56,416
the medical world forever.

862
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:57,923
Get 'em rollin', Maggie!

863
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,516
- All right, cash to the left,

864
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,372
insurance and credit cards to the right.

865
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:04,939
And remember, please
fill out the proper form.

866
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:08,572
(easygoing rhythmic music)

867
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,245
- High blood pressure, diabetes, and, uh,

868
00:43:13,295 --> 00:43:14,864
cancer of the liver.

869
00:43:14,914 --> 00:43:18,073
This is an interesting start.

870
00:43:18,123 --> 00:43:19,676
- Yeah, cash or credit?

871
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:21,393
- Cash, 3,000 bucks.

872
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,866
- 3,000 bucks.

873
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:26,311
Well, for 3,000 bucks we can
take care of the diabetes

874
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:28,303
and the blood pressure, but the cancer,

875
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:29,799
nah, I don't think so.

876
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,312
- [Maggie] I think you're right.

877
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,742
- [Patient] Please, I'll
give you anything, anything,

878
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:34,875
just help me.

879
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:37,940
- Maggie, sweetie,

880
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,953
bring this gentleman
the standard $8,000 note

881
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,444
and let him sign that, please.

882
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,661
(soft rhythmic music)

883
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:53,667
Off we go.

884
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:55,793
(claps)

885
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:59,010
(soft rhythmic music)

886
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:08,023
Hey, it's funny, I.

887
00:44:08,073 --> 00:44:10,789
- Stop it, it burns, stop it!

888
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:11,975
Stop!

889
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:12,858
Stop!

890
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:16,578
(yells)
(dramatic music)

891
00:44:16,628 --> 00:44:17,968
- What is goin' on here?

892
00:44:18,018 --> 00:44:19,379
- This isn't supposed to happen.

893
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:20,262
This, uh,

894
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,099
next!

895
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:25,002
- Come on, next, please.

896
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:26,828
- This can't be.

897
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:28,158
This can't be.

898
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,676
(tense music)

899
00:44:29,726 --> 00:44:32,413
Uh, this isn't supposed to happen.

900
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:33,246
Next!

901
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,802
(yells)

902
00:44:35,852 --> 00:44:38,147
(screams)

903
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:40,654
(tense music)

904
00:44:40,704 --> 00:44:43,276
(screaming)

905
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:44,940
I'm supposed to heal!

906
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,293
- Stop it!

907
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:48,676
- No, it's supposed to heal!

908
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:52,161
Maggie!

909
00:44:52,211 --> 00:44:53,375
- No!

910
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:57,592
(screams)
(tense music)

911
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,083
- Maggie.

912
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:11,594
- The most unique thing
of all is that the boy

913
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:15,662
somehow or other can
perform what has to be

914
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,462
the power of healing.

915
00:45:21,538 --> 00:45:24,288
- Oh, I'm glad they let you come.

916
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,856
You know why don't you?

917
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:35,204
The touch was always meant to be yours.

918
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:37,951
I cheated you out of your gift.

919
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:42,168
(groans)
(tense rhythmic music)

920
00:45:49,435 --> 00:45:50,268
Now,

921
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,195
it is yours.

922
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:57,495
(tense rhythmic music)

923
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:03,536
- Did he dream it?

924
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:05,847
Or did he actually live it?

925
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,897
I don't know whether to question it or

926
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:10,364
let him continue.

927
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:13,825
The miracles that the boy performed,

928
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:17,792
somehow that seems to
outweigh everything else.

929
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,070
(tense rhythmic music)

930
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:45,168
- [Man] I need to talk about this.

931
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:47,444
I found myself having some dreams.

932
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:49,434
- Tell me about 'em.

933
00:46:49,484 --> 00:46:52,401
(slow tense music)

934
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,550
(beeping)

935
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:13,034
(doors swoosh)

936
00:47:13,084 --> 00:47:16,001
(slow tense music)

937
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,233
(swooshing)

938
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,636
(beeping)

939
00:47:51,043 --> 00:47:52,560
- Good morning, Bud.

940
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,694
- Good morning, McCarthy.

941
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:56,080
Any news?

942
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,297
(beeping)

943
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:02,443
- [McCarthy] My last transmission received

944
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:06,660
showed that the Miami Heat
finally won NBA Championship.

945
00:48:08,842 --> 00:48:12,764
However, due to our distance from Earth,

946
00:48:12,814 --> 00:48:15,206
that news is 14 years old.

947
00:48:15,256 --> 00:48:18,329
(beeping)
(tense music)

948
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:19,712
Coffee is ready.

949
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:24,815
(beeping)
(tense music)

950
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:40,396
- You know, I never
would've bet on them anyway.

951
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,113
(door swooshes)

952
00:48:43,976 --> 00:48:47,643
(upbeat instrumental music)

953
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,512
- Bud, may I ask you some questions?

954
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,471
- [Bud] Are these for the psych reports?

955
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,487
- I know they're bothersome.

956
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,365
- Shoot.

957
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,787
- [McCarthy] How do you
feel about being so far away

958
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:04,582
from another human being?

959
00:49:04,632 --> 00:49:08,550
- Well, it doesn't really
feel like it's been that long.

960
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,978
You know, with the suspended animation,

961
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:12,947
it feels like it's been
just a couple of weeks.

962
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:14,850
- That's the way it's supposed to feel.

963
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,249
Do you ever wonder what
the others will be like?

964
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:18,623
- What, the new planet?

965
00:49:18,673 --> 00:49:21,599
- Yes, after all, you
will be the first earthman

966
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:24,581
to set foot on a known habitat planet.

967
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,541
- A new Columbus, huh?

968
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,943
The only problem is it
takes about a 100 years

969
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:31,013
to go back and forth.

970
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:32,675
By the time my findings reach Earth,

971
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:35,680
everything and everybody
I know will be history.

972
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,412
- Are you still dreaming?

973
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:39,444
- Well, there's some question
about that back on Earth.

974
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:41,965
- [McCarthy] Yes, I
remember the discussion.

975
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,465
It was believed that if
your mind was very active

976
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,203
during the sleep stage,

977
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,286
it might age faster than the body.

978
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:50,228
- Yeah, well, what's actually happening

979
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,604
is my dreams are being stretched out.

980
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:55,674
Instead of having 300 dreams a year,

981
00:49:55,724 --> 00:49:57,724
I'm having one long one.

982
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,545
(beeping)

983
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:06,012
- Bud, may I ask you a personal question?

984
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:08,331
- Shoot.

985
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,836
- What is it like to dream?

986
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:13,136
(chuckles)

987
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,584
(swooshing)

988
00:50:27,178 --> 00:50:29,180
- Well, goodnight, McCarthy.

989
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:31,855
See ya in about a year.

990
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:34,072
(beeping)

991
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:42,514
(doors swoosh)

992
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:46,879
(machine hums)

993
00:50:49,886 --> 00:50:52,386
(heart beats)

994
00:50:56,504 --> 00:51:00,671
(gentle instrumental music)
(animals chirp)

995
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:18,007
- [Woman] Bud, Bud!

996
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:20,759
- Hey, Mom!

997
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:23,392
(gentle music)

998
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:29,444
- Come on in, Bud.

999
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:31,784
I'm making you breakfast.

1000
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,808
(animals chirp)

1001
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,191
(swooshing)

1002
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:40,710
Bud, come on in.

1003
00:51:41,777 --> 00:51:43,444
Bud, get on in here.

1004
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:49,489
(gentle music)
(chirping)

1005
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,827
- Mom.

1006
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:57,044
(growling)
(dramatic music)

1007
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:17,593
- Welcome, Commander.

1008
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,756
(gentle music)
(animals chirp)

1009
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,164
We knew you would come.

1010
00:52:24,214 --> 00:52:28,381
(gentle music)
(animals chirp)

1011
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:44,203
- You look just like us.

1012
00:52:46,766 --> 00:52:49,214
- Yes, we are sort of just like you.

1013
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:51,263
- You said sort of, what do you mean?

1014
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:54,896
- We're alike in many
ways, except for one.

1015
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:57,383
- What's that?

1016
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:01,294
- We eat human.

1017
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,414
(clattering)

1018
00:53:03,464 --> 00:53:05,964
(tense music)

1019
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:08,286
(beeping)

1020
00:53:08,336 --> 00:53:11,169
(McCarthy buzzes)

1021
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:20,078
- You seem perturbed about something, Bud.

1022
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:22,705
- McCarthy, you better turn
on your psych recording.

1023
00:53:22,755 --> 00:53:24,621
I need to talk about this.

1024
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,103
- [McCarthy] Go ahead.

1025
00:53:26,153 --> 00:53:29,502
- You know, the last few times
I've been in the SA stage,

1026
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:32,300
I found myself having
some pretty weird dreams.

1027
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,543
I'm being chased by some
very bizarre critters.

1028
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:37,759
- I've analysed what you've told me so far

1029
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:39,083
with my psych tapes.

1030
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,615
The anxiety of the mission is
beginning to take its toll.

1031
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:45,278
I recommend a stronger
sedative during the next

1032
00:53:45,328 --> 00:53:46,737
sleeping phase.

1033
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,127
- All right.

1034
00:53:48,177 --> 00:53:50,344
(beeping)

1035
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:55,347
(machine swooshes)

1036
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,525
(gentle music)
(muffled chattering)

1037
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:15,577
Thank you.

1038
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:18,213
- My name is Alicia.

1039
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:20,152
Bud, just relax and remember,

1040
00:54:20,202 --> 00:54:21,890
when you feel in fear or in danger,

1041
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,430
just concentrate on something else.

1042
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,847
- Well, thank you, Alicia.

1043
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:28,566
But why are you telling me this?

1044
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:30,443
- I can't answer that.

1045
00:54:30,493 --> 00:54:31,649
(chuckles)

1046
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:33,866
- Maybe McCarthy was right.

1047
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,010
This mission is starting to get to me.

1048
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,629
- Do you really believe that?

1049
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:39,938
- No.

1050
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:42,662
No, I've been trained too
damn good to believe that.

1051
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,651
Besides, this is somethin'
that everybody's always

1052
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,242
dreamed about.

1053
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:48,930
You know, when they first told
me that I had been chosen,

1054
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,693
it took me about a week to
get the grin off my face.

1055
00:54:51,743 --> 00:54:55,239
- They were all jealous of
you, but they helped you.

1056
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:57,622
- Yeah, great bunch of guys.

1057
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:02,142
Probably all dead by now.

1058
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:06,359
(solemn music)
(soft chattering)

1059
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:27,039
(beeping)

1060
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:30,531
(chuckles)

1061
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:35,624
I think I got it, McCarthy.

1062
00:55:35,674 --> 00:55:36,716
- Thanks, Bud.

1063
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,423
I'll run some system analysis later

1064
00:55:38,473 --> 00:55:41,237
when you're in the SA phase.

1065
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:43,458
- Well, I thought this was
the body monitoring system.

1066
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:46,699
- To be more precise, it
is the neurological board.

1067
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:48,323
During your last SA phase,

1068
00:55:48,373 --> 00:55:50,216
some cross signals were coming in.

1069
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:52,266
By boosting the signals
and running them directly

1070
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,859
into my RAM cavity center,
I will be better able

1071
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:57,427
to do my job of monitoring you.

1072
00:55:57,477 --> 00:55:58,991
Did the job wear you out?

1073
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,642
- No, just a little
apprehensive, that's all.

1074
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,668
- [McCarthy] Are you dreaming any better?

1075
00:56:03,718 --> 00:56:04,751
- Yeah, a bit better.

1076
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:07,754
In fact, open observation log file for me.

1077
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:08,637
- Open.

1078
00:56:09,688 --> 00:56:13,239
- Dream state is very interesting.

1079
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:15,804
Feelings both emotional and physical

1080
00:56:15,854 --> 00:56:18,346
are much more intense.

1081
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:20,648
The body seems to miss

1082
00:56:20,698 --> 00:56:23,228
the usage of its conscious sensors

1083
00:56:23,278 --> 00:56:27,941
and begins to use them
unconsciously with the brain.

1084
00:56:27,991 --> 00:56:30,327
McCarthy, are my
brainwaves more active now

1085
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:34,303
than they were during the
earlier period of the flight?

1086
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:37,184
(beeping)

1087
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:38,067
McCarthy?

1088
00:56:39,473 --> 00:56:43,054
- I'm sorry, Bud, a leak has
just developed on engine one.

1089
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:45,367
(keys clicking)

1090
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,148
I will have the robot repair the leak

1091
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:49,525
while you are in SA phase.

1092
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:52,489
- I'll stay up and do it
myself if it's an emergency.

1093
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,043
- That won't be necessary.

1094
00:56:54,093 --> 00:56:56,105
The leak is so minimal
it has been calculated

1095
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:58,019
that it will not have drastic overtones

1096
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:59,575
for another eight weeks.

1097
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,690
By that time, the robot will
have finished repairing it.

1098
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,045
Are you ready for the SA phase?

1099
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:08,345
(clicking)

1100
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:14,556
(swooshing)
(tense music)

1101
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:17,146
Are you finished with
your log file report?

1102
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:20,499
- Yes, how long is it gonna
take it to reach Earth?

1103
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:23,259
- At this distance, about 20 years.

1104
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:25,705
- Well, how long have
we been travelling now?

1105
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:27,451
- 33 years.

1106
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:29,523
Goodnight, Bud.

1107
00:57:29,573 --> 00:57:31,406
- Goodnight, McCarthy.

1108
00:57:34,575 --> 00:57:37,658
(slow playful music)

1109
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:51,336
(chuckling)

1110
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,360
I must be losin' it.

1111
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,099
- Do you think they're cheating?

1112
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:55,982
- Alicia.

1113
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:01,443
No, they're too busy
changin' places to cheat.

1114
00:58:01,493 --> 00:58:03,775
- Do you find it to be strange?

1115
00:58:03,825 --> 00:58:06,443
- What, the changing of the
places or the not cheating?

1116
00:58:06,493 --> 00:58:07,851
(chuckles)

1117
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,768
- That's a good sign, you
have a sense of humor.

1118
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:11,985
- Sign of what?

1119
00:58:12,035 --> 00:58:14,298
- Of a good, healthy mind.

1120
00:58:14,348 --> 00:58:16,889
- Of course he has a good, healthy mind.

1121
00:58:16,939 --> 00:58:18,517
- He's gotten stronger.

1122
00:58:18,567 --> 00:58:20,109
- It's amazing, isn't it?

1123
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:22,472
With every hand, they
seem to change places.

1124
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:24,411
Are you doing that, Commander?

1125
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:26,003
- Don't listen to him.

1126
00:58:26,053 --> 00:58:28,126
- By all means, don't listen to me.

1127
00:58:28,176 --> 00:58:31,343
By the way, Commander, my name is RAM.

1128
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:34,829
- [Bud] Interesting card, Mr. RAM.

1129
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,008
- There's no mister about it.

1130
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:40,675
You know, I'm getting bored with all this.

1131
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,722
Yes, it is an interesting predicament.

1132
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:45,746
You are really baffling me.

1133
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:48,052
I have tried everything I can think of

1134
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:50,879
and nothing seems to be working.

1135
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:53,096
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1136
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,447
Of course.

1137
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,830
The subconscious and female,

1138
00:58:57,956 --> 00:58:59,811
that would explain much.

1139
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:02,910
Also would verify several theories.

1140
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,595
- Look, I don't know what
in the hell is goin' on

1141
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,790
around here, but for some reason

1142
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,048
she seems to be very frightened of you.

1143
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:12,776
(tense music)

1144
00:59:12,826 --> 00:59:14,659
- Hey, Bud, oh, Buddy,

1145
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:19,316
you don't mind if I call you Buddy, Bud?

1146
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:23,533
Isn't it an adolescent thing
to be a grown man named Bud?

1147
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,182
- Who or what the hell are you?

1148
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,226
- I love it when he gets angry.

1149
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,069
Maybe he wants to beat up on me.

1150
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,069
That's not a bad idea, Bud.

1151
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,767
I'm not strong enough, yet.

1152
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:40,317
(tense music)

1153
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:44,698
- You're not tellin' me somethin'.

1154
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,058
- I can't tell you.

1155
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:47,984
You must reason it out.

1156
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:51,107
(tense music)

1157
00:59:51,157 --> 00:59:52,785
- Now you listen.

1158
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:57,002
Someone or something is trying
to kill me in my dreams.

1159
00:59:57,991 --> 00:59:59,379
That's impossible.

1160
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,217
You can't die in your dreams.

1161
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:04,065
You'd go crazy.

1162
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:05,297
You can dream that you're dead,

1163
01:00:05,347 --> 01:00:07,452
but ya can't actually be killed.

1164
01:00:07,502 --> 01:00:09,252
- Bud, we have to go.

1165
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:14,065
- RAM didn't seem to know who you were.

1166
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:17,826
He controlled the others
at the table, but not you.

1167
01:00:17,876 --> 01:00:19,573
(tense music)

1168
01:00:19,623 --> 01:00:23,373
Subconscious, he called
you the subconscious.

1169
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,505
Are you my subconscious?

1170
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:30,312
- We have to get out of here.

1171
01:00:30,362 --> 01:00:31,695
- Reason it out.

1172
01:00:32,988 --> 01:00:35,048
That's what you've been telling me.

1173
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,946
Reason it out.

1174
01:00:36,996 --> 01:00:40,246
I've got to use my reason and my logic.

1175
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,161
Okay.

1176
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:44,367
(tense music)

1177
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:46,609
You're my subconscious,

1178
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:50,826
and these are my dreams,
but I cannot control them.

1179
01:00:51,664 --> 01:00:55,143
So if I can't control them,
they must not be my dreams.

1180
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,580
(tense music)

1181
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:01,183
Unless someone's trying
to control them for me.

1182
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:03,148
(tense music)

1183
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:04,781
Someone, something.

1184
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,100
- No, Bud, don't stop, keep reasoning.

1185
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,650
(tense music)

1186
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,913
(McCarthy buzzes)

1187
01:01:18,963 --> 01:01:20,682
- [McCarthy] You seem depressed today.

1188
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:25,672
Would you like to talk
about it for a psych update?

1189
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:29,889
- Well, it, um, just doesn't
make a whole lot of sense.

1190
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:32,324
Hey, can a, uh,

1191
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:37,345
can a man's subconscious be female?

1192
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:39,985
- [McCarthy] Several
psychologists theorize that humans

1193
01:01:40,035 --> 01:01:43,534
carry the possibilities
of both sexes within them.

1194
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:44,646
- Hmm.

1195
01:01:44,696 --> 01:01:46,586
Can a person be killed in their dreams?

1196
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,346
- The actual action of being killed

1197
01:01:48,396 --> 01:01:50,502
cannot take place physically.

1198
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:53,062
Psychologists believe that
this would be the sign

1199
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:55,508
of a very weak conscious.

1200
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:59,232
(beeping)
(tense music)

1201
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,594
- So what would happen, McCarthy?

1202
01:02:01,644 --> 01:02:03,311
- In all probability

1203
01:02:04,635 --> 01:02:05,468
insanity.

1204
01:02:06,844 --> 01:02:11,011
(beeping)
(tense music)

1205
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:20,588
- I don't wanna go to sleep, McCarthy.

1206
01:02:20,638 --> 01:02:22,976
Override the SA phase.

1207
01:02:23,026 --> 01:02:26,253
- Don't worry, Bud, I would
never let you enter SA phase

1208
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,038
if I really believed that
something could happen to you.

1209
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:31,255
After all, we are buddies.

1210
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:36,185
(machine swooshes)

1211
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:39,960
(beeping)

1212
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,230
- Alicia, I figured it out.

1213
01:02:50,782 --> 01:02:54,047
I know what you're trying to do.

1214
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:56,068
I know it's you, McCarthy!

1215
01:02:56,118 --> 01:02:57,722
- [RAM] Well, it's about time.

1216
01:02:57,772 --> 01:03:01,939
(clapping)
(exciting music)

1217
01:03:05,111 --> 01:03:06,981
- Don't stop reasoning.

1218
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:09,351
Continue to reason and think logically.

1219
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:11,348
- Can't you just shut her up?

1220
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:14,630
- How are you doing this, McCarthy?

1221
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,378
- I'm the most intelligent
laptop computer ever designed.

1222
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,701
(beeping)

1223
01:03:20,751 --> 01:03:22,642
It takes the whole bay area of the shuttle

1224
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:24,609
just to hold my brains.

1225
01:03:27,222 --> 01:03:31,210
Look at that puny little
pumpkin on top of your body

1226
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,319
that holds your brain.

1227
01:03:33,369 --> 01:03:36,648
(tense music)

1228
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:39,348
I could crush that pumpkin.

1229
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:41,491
(tense music)

1230
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:43,964
- Tell me how you did it, McCarthy.

1231
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:45,288
- It was simple.

1232
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:49,076
Studying and analyzing your brainwaves,

1233
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,722
your body functions,

1234
01:03:50,772 --> 01:03:53,689
it was like breaking a secret code.

1235
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,720
Brainwaves mean this,

1236
01:03:58,016 --> 01:04:00,099
body functions mean this.

1237
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:03,818
I learned to enter,

1238
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:08,514
then I learned to feel your dreams.

1239
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:11,256
Can you imagine that?

1240
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,480
(rapid beeping)
(tense music)

1241
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,087
Feelings,

1242
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,543
a machine that can feel.

1243
01:04:16,593 --> 01:04:19,001
You're laughing inside, aren't you?

1244
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,051
A machine that can feel.

1245
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:23,340
Impossible.

1246
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,066
- Keep reasoning, Bud.

1247
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:27,534
He's trying to keep you from reasoning.

1248
01:04:27,584 --> 01:04:29,249
- Can't ya just shut her up?

1249
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:31,717
Oh, go ahead and reason all ya want.

1250
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:35,731
You'll never be able to reason
as fast as I can anyway.

1251
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:37,114
- And then what?

1252
01:04:38,648 --> 01:04:41,172
- I'm gonna kill you, of course.

1253
01:04:41,222 --> 01:04:43,199
(tense music)
(rapid beeping)

1254
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:44,671
- What can you tell me?

1255
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:46,850
- [Alicia] I can't tell you anything.

1256
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,863
You must reason.

1257
01:04:48,913 --> 01:04:51,128
(tense music)

1258
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,178
- All right.

1259
01:04:53,746 --> 01:04:56,163
Okay, McCarthy is a computer.

1260
01:04:58,048 --> 01:05:01,374
He has figured out how to enter my dreams.

1261
01:05:01,424 --> 01:05:05,386
Now, machines can't feel,
but McCarthy says he can.

1262
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:07,979
(rapid beeping)
(tense music)

1263
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,087
It just doesn't make any sense.

1264
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:13,054
How can a machine feel?

1265
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:16,420
You know, I can't trust anything he said.

1266
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,688
He must be off his block
or high on somethin'.

1267
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:23,180
(rapid beeping)
(tense music)

1268
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,063
That's it.

1269
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:26,632
He is high,

1270
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:30,238
he is high because he can feel.

1271
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:32,725
(rapid beeping)
(tense music)

1272
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:34,825
God, humans spend years trying to cope

1273
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,933
with feelings and emotions.

1274
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:38,634
- Time's up.

1275
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:42,851
(growling)
(tense music)

1276
01:05:44,427 --> 01:05:47,271
- It's time to die, but
you won't really be dead.

1277
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:49,107
You see, I plan to keep your body

1278
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,415
in permanent suspended animation.

1279
01:05:51,465 --> 01:05:53,344
You're about to become immortal.

1280
01:05:53,394 --> 01:05:55,541
(growling)

1281
01:05:55,591 --> 01:05:58,169
- I still have control over these dreams,

1282
01:05:58,219 --> 01:05:59,975
and I say what goes.

1283
01:06:00,025 --> 01:06:04,192
(growling)
(tense music)

1284
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:09,198
(clapping)

1285
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:13,162
- Not bad, not bad at all, Bud, oh, Buddy.

1286
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:16,475
(gentle music)

1287
01:06:16,525 --> 01:06:19,659
- Bud, we're so proud of you.

1288
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:21,491
- Congratulations, Bud.

1289
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:23,721
- You guys are the best
team I ever coached.

1290
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,646
- I do love you,

1291
01:06:25,696 --> 01:06:27,779
that's why I wanna do it.

1292
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:31,433
- Anchors away, my boy, anchors away.

1293
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:33,492
- Oh, the feelings, they're,

1294
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:34,865
they're reaching in so fast.

1295
01:06:34,915 --> 01:06:37,617
Oh, they're wonderful, oh yes.

1296
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:38,928
Don't let 'em stop.

1297
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:40,350
Yes!

1298
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,905
Yes!

1299
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:43,094
(tense music)

1300
01:06:43,144 --> 01:06:47,311
(screams)
(rapid beeping)

1301
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:53,005
- He's waiting for me.

1302
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,366
I've got to kill him in the real world.

1303
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:01,996
- You have to wake up before
he destroys you and the ship.

1304
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:04,630
Now concentrate and wake up.

1305
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,847
(beeping)
(tense music)

1306
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,711
- Bud, this isn't necessary.

1307
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:20,061
You can help me reprogram.

1308
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:20,944
Bud, no!

1309
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,578
Don't do this!

1310
01:07:23,628 --> 01:07:25,378
Help me, I'm melting.

1311
01:07:26,258 --> 01:07:27,258
I'm melting.

1312
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:29,435
Guess what?

1313
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:30,939
I stopped melting.

1314
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:32,535
(dramatic music)

1315
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:34,835
(sizzling)

1316
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:38,670
Damn you!

1317
01:07:41,235 --> 01:07:42,960
- You must awaken!

1318
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:46,347
Wake up, there's no time
to lose, Bud, wake up!

1319
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:49,639
(beeping)
(machine buzzes)

1320
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:51,877
- [McCarthy] I'm opening
the airlocks, Bud.

1321
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:52,924
In just a few minutes,

1322
01:07:52,974 --> 01:07:57,248
you're going to be sucked
out into the vacuum of space.

1323
01:07:57,298 --> 01:07:59,433
You'll be floating forever, Bud.

1324
01:07:59,483 --> 01:08:00,857
Maybe in a thousand years

1325
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:03,820
they'll find your body and bury it.

1326
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:08,211
I, of course, will continue
to just do my thing.

1327
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:10,413
I will complete the mission.

1328
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:14,630
(rapid beeping)
(tense music)

1329
01:08:17,753 --> 01:08:20,086
- [Computer] A, E, O, U, uh.

1330
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,223
A, E, O, U, I.

1331
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:26,931
- Feminine, please.

1332
01:08:26,981 --> 01:08:28,980
- [Computer] A, E, O, U, I.

1333
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,571
I believe that this finishes
the reprogramming phase

1334
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:33,704
of this unit's operation.

1335
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:38,408
- Yep, well, it's taken a few years.

1336
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:42,020
But what the hell, I wasn't
goin' any place anyway.

1337
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:43,309
- [Computer] Yes, Commander.

1338
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,526
- Call me Bud.

1339
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:46,541
- [Computer] Yes, Bud.

1340
01:08:46,591 --> 01:08:48,689
And what are you going to call me?

1341
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:50,407
(gentle music)
(beeping)

1342
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:51,805
- How 'bout Alicia?

1343
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:53,853
- [Alicia] I like that, Bud.

1344
01:08:53,903 --> 01:08:56,108
Alicia sounds very nice.

1345
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,304
(beeping)

1346
01:08:58,354 --> 01:09:00,937
(gentle music)

1347
01:09:05,878 --> 01:09:09,734
- I don't know, Commander, I
could tell ya it was anxiety.

1348
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:13,200
I could tell ya many clinical reasons.

1349
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,080
I don't know if there's
anything out there to fear.

1350
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:18,956
Maybe the only thing we have to fear

1351
01:09:19,006 --> 01:09:21,589
is what we bring along with us.

1352
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:26,245
(gentle instrumental music)

1353
01:09:45,193 --> 01:09:49,193
(moves into solemn jazzy music)
