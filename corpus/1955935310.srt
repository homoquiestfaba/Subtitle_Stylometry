There it is, though.

There it is
in black and white.

186
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,626
So...

187
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:02,895
what's wrong with you?

188
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,464
I beg your pardon?

189
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,166
You're hardly the picture
of health. What's wrong?

190
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:08,567
You don't want to know.

191
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,403
I'm fascinated.

192
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:13,072
- Tell me.
- What's wrong with you?

193
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:16,609
I have an unquenchable bloodlust
for darkness and depravity.

194
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,577
That's nice.

195
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:19,946
Is it cancer?

196

No, no.
[coughs]

197
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,052
Has anyone ever introduced you
to the concept of small talk?

198
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:29,389
Well, what is it
if it's not cancer?

199
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,190

200
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,326
No way.

00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:35,294
That is brilliant.

202
00:13:35,296 --> 00:13:36,995
You're a bit odd, aren't you?

203
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,599
Unquestionably, but death
is by far the best bit.

204

- Of life!

You're funny.

All right,
let's examine the facts.

208
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:53,479
It's terminal, your sides hurt,
and you cough badly.

209
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:55,380
All signs point to
malignant tumor damage.

210
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,517
You're not in denial about it,
are you?

211
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,220
You're not desperately searching
for another explanation?

213
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,026
Yeah.

No, thanks.

215
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:12,667
But you don't know...
why or how?

216
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,400
No.

217
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,602
Will it be painful?

218
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,404
Oh, no.

219
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:23,109
Well, how can you be sure?

Lolly?

226
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,221
It's definitely not cancer.

227
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,591
Okay. I don't want to
waste my time diagnosing you

228
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,592
if it's going to be some
run of the mill cancer thing.

229
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:42,461
Who says I need diagnosing?

230
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,029
You're dying.

231
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,298
Painfully, apparently.

232
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,100
And they don't know
why or what of.

233
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:49,568
It just sounds
pretty undiagnosed to me.

234
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,437
We're all dying, you realize.

235

Just a matter of time, friend.

for you?

Not very well.

what that means.

Wife, kids?

244
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,256
Okay, you can't say that.

245
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:12,591
It's "survived by."

246
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,126
It has no other
grammatical context.

247
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:16,361

Yeah.

Oh.

250
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,400
That's fair enough, I suppose.

we haven't met before?

I don't know. Have we?

256
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,687
One shouldn't answer a question

00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,667
It's the waiting
that's doing me in.

536
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,403
Just, um...

537
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:56,407
sitting around,
waiting to stop breathing.

538
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,846
My mom went in a house fire.

539
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,213
No waiting around there,
I suppose.

540
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,082
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

541
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,451
You are utterly self-involved
at the moment,

542
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,220
completely wrapped up
in yourself.

543
00:30:08,222 --> 00:30:10,221
Steady on.
Just 'cause I'm on my way out

544
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,324
doesn't mean I've turned
into a complete bastard.

545
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:13,991
Why not?

546
00:30:13,993 --> 00:30:15,559
It's your prerogative.

547
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:17,362
That is your hard-won
silver lining.

548
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,529
I don't follow.

549
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,464
Okay, well, think of it
this way.

550
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,034
It's moral carte blanche.

551
00:30:22,036 --> 00:30:24,036
It's an open invitation
to anarchy.

552
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,672
You can spend
your last days on Earth

553
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,573
doing whatever you want.

554
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:29,942
Rape away.

555
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,676
Smite to your heart's content.

556
00:30:31,678 --> 00:30:33,511
Pillage the precinct
till the gutters run red,

557
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:34,980
and none of it will matter

558
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:37,182
because you'll be dead
by Sunday.

559
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:38,683
So go nuts!

560
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:43,124
You know, dry roasted,
sniper in the clock tower nuts.

561
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,092
Did something happen to you
as a child?

562
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:49,126
Besides my mother dying in agony
in a blazing inferno?

563
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:51,430
Oh, I am so sorry.
That was...

564
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,499
Don't apologize.
Rub my nose in it.

565
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,733
Come on, pillage me!

566
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,338
Sorry. Was that a bit naughty?

567
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:03,010
What happened to your thumb?

568
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:05,346
Oh, that.

569
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:08,680
An exercise in self-control.

570
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,249
Ah. It went well then.

571
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:12,353
[chuckles]

572
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,619
Look, all I'm saying is

573
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:18,390
this seems like
a really good opportunity

574
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,192
to do whatever
the hell you want.

575
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:23,194
Well, what if I want to
mope around in all-night cafes,

576
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:25,196
feeling sorry for myself?

577
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:27,365
Then, frankly,
I might as well do you in now

578
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,768
and save myself from
your self-indulgent tripe.

579
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,436
[laughing, coughing]

580
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:33,704
Well...

581
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:36,141
Well, I would appreciate that.

582
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:38,042
Annie.

583
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:39,179
Bill.

584
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:51,690
That's not your locker!

585
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,692
You're going to give me
a fucking heart attack!

586
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:56,294
It is a criminal offense
to interfere with

587
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:59,397
either municipal storage
or precinct property.

588
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,099
Any suspicious activity
must be reported

589
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:04,504
to the appropriate
authorities immediately.

590
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,575
Why don't you piss off,
old man?

591
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:13,345
Mind your own business.

592
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:16,213
Supervisor.
Night Supervisor.

593
00:32:16,215 --> 00:32:18,316
Duties to include sweeping
of concourse and platform,

594
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:19,683
maintenance
and attendance of all...

595
00:32:19,685 --> 00:32:20,687
Shut up!

596
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,355
Tell me something.

597
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,425
Do I look to you like
the sort of individual

598
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:29,728
that creeps into the station
in the dead of night,

599
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,229
breaks open a locker,

600
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,298
removes a suspicious-looking
briefcase,

601
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,703
and then lets
the fucking cleaner...

602
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:42,339
sorry, night supervisor...

603
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:44,776
run off and tell tall tales
about it?

604
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,510
Do I not strike you
more as the sort of

605
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:49,614
highly motivated,
highly vicious individual

606
00:32:49,616 --> 00:32:52,550
that would not kill
said night supervisor

607
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,086
and stuff him
into the fucking locker?

608
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:58,789
Acceptable forms of payment
at the terminal are as follows:

609
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,226
cash, banker's drafts,

610
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:04,298
certified checks up to the
value of the return journey.

611
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:07,667
[laughing]

612
00:33:11,437 --> 00:33:14,506
I like you. You're funny.

613
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:17,174
All right, all right,
I'll clear it.

614
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:19,376
- Oh.
- Mum's the word, Supe.

615
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:20,545
- Okay.
- [laughs]

616
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:24,115
- Oh!
- Ten, twenty, thirty.

617
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:26,053
We all right, son?

618
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:32,891
When rich villains
have need of poor ones,

619
00:33:32,893 --> 00:33:36,431
poor ones make
what price they will.

620
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:40,664
Come again?

621
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,234
I want more money.

622
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,269
Yeah.

623
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:47,207
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

624
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,576
You know, when rich villains
get pissed off

625
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,545
with poor ones
overcharging them,

626
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,547
they go round their house,

627
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,853
they burn it,
they murder their family.

628
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:05,190
Terminal Train Lines
thanks you for your business

629
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:08,463
and wishes you
a pleasant evening.

630
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,405
What a fucking crook!

631
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,415
[whistle]

632
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:35,486
- Yo, you better give me your...
- Fuck off!

633
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:36,955
I just wanted to know
the time, mate.

634
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,323
My bad.

635
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,624
Yeah, that's it,
fucking walk on.

636
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,725
Yeah, yeah, you better run.

637
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:43,196
Dickhead.

638
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:47,432
[laughing]

639
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,301
- Just for you.
- Thanks.

640
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,368
[door slams]

641
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,937
VINCE: Evening, bottle blonde.

642
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:54,673
Hello, Prince Charming.

643
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,475
- Alfred.
- Vince.

644
00:34:57,477 --> 00:34:59,377
You want to put her down, mate.

645
00:34:59,379 --> 00:35:02,316
You don't know where she's been.
You'll catch something.

646
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,283
Duty calls.

647
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:08,222
Well, it was lovely
seeing you again, handsome.

648
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,597
Can't say the same
for you, Vincent.

649
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,734
You want to get your head
in the game, mate?

650
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:24,539
You're getting sloppy.

651
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,504
I'll see you around,
bottle blonde,

652
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,006
if I don't shoot you first.

653
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,977
Ooh.

654
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:35,882
Vince!

655
00:35:39,419 --> 00:35:40,655
Bang.

656
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:45,756
Wanker.

657
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:48,929
[machines beeping]

658
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,341
This was in the briefcase.

659
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:07,448
Press play.
I'm gonna stretch my legs.

660
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:14,451
<i>I am Mr. Franklin.</i>

661
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:17,055
<i>I have no doubt
you know who I am</i>

662
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:19,723
<i>and what my business is worth.</i>

663
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:22,926
<i>I have an offer, a contract.</i>

664
00:36:22,928 --> 00:36:26,698
<i>I want you
to kill someone for me.</i>

665
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,433
<i>You will lie in wait
in the apartment</i>

666
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:31,535
<i>I have provided for you.</i>

667
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,805
<i>You will be on call
24 hours a day,</i>

668
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,875
<i>seven days a week,</i>

669
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:39,944
<i>until I contact you to...</i>

670
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:41,845
<i>execute.</i>

671
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:43,381
Jesus.

672
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,948
<i>Before you commence,</i>

673
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,653
<i>I require one of you to
attend a face-to-face meeting.</i>

674
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:52,424
<i>Only one.
I do not like crowds.</i>

675
00:36:52,426 --> 00:36:54,325
<i>That is all.</i>

676
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,630
Fucking perfect.

677
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,661
Evening, bottle blonde.

678
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:33,401
Out for a casual stroll?

679
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,044
[Annie whistles]

680
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,382
Well, for fuck's sake.

681
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,752
You know what?
I'm getting a little bit old

682
00:38:27,754 --> 00:38:30,725
for all these parlor games,
bottle blonde.

683
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,549
Evening, gorgeous.

684
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:59,053
These are for you.

685
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,154
You're in trouble, Alfred.

686
00:39:03,156 --> 00:39:05,022
I'm always in trouble,
sugarplum.

687
00:39:05,024 --> 00:39:07,691
Spare me the heroics.
You're in real trouble.

688
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,060
Targeted,
shot in the back of the head

689
00:39:09,062 --> 00:39:10,928
unless you pay attention
trouble.

690
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,897
I'm listening.

691
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:16,133
Good, because I like you.

692
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:18,937
You're handsome,
and you're chivalrous,

693
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,537
and I like your jaw.

694
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,707
It's manly.

695
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,875
I want to keep you.

696
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:27,180
- Well, I think you're...
- Shut up.

697
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:30,048
Understood.

698
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,750
There's someone here to see you.

699
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:35,553
Listen to what he's got to say
or that handsome face of yours

700
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:39,189
will have a gaping exit wound
slap bang in the middle of it.

701
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,558
- Okay.
- Good.

702
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,897
Come on out.
He's not gonna bite.

703
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,232
[door slides closed]

704
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:50,100
Hello?

705
00:39:50,102 --> 00:39:52,039
[ringing]

706
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,727
[ring]

707
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:18,196
MR. FRANKLIN:
<i>Good evening, Vincent.</i>

708
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:20,665
Mr. fucking Franklin,
I presume.

709
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,100
- <i>The very same.</i>
- Let me get this straight.

710
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,636
You drag me out
in the middle of the night,

711
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:27,037
halfway across the city,
freezing cold,

712
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,140
up 20 flights of rickety stairs

713
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:31,609
just so that you can speak to me
on the fucking phone?

714
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:34,578
<i>Who says mystery's a lost art?</i>

715
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,046
Yeah, fair enough.

716
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,249
<i>Now, the contract.</i>

717
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,919
<i>You and your partner
start tomorrow.</i>

718
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,687
<i>The target will be
lured to this window.</i>

719
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,823
<i>It faces the apartment
where you will be waiting.</i>

720
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:48,959
<i>One shot to the head.</i>

721
00:40:48,961 --> 00:40:51,796
<i>A clean kill. No mistakes.</i>

722
00:40:51,798 --> 00:40:57,134
<i>Now, I have another deal,
a side part, for you.</i>

723
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:59,136
VINCE: <i>Okay, go on.</i>

724
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:01,138
MR. FRANKLIN: <i>When you've
executed the contract,</i>

725
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,642
<i>I want you
to kill your partner.</i>

726
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:07,044
Why?

727
00:41:07,046 --> 00:41:08,580
<i>I don't like crowds.</i>

728
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:12,649
<i>And I like loyalty I can buy.</i>

729
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:16,022
<i>Double the original offer,
in cash.</i>

730
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:22,026
What you want,
his head on a silver platter?

731
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:25,997
<i>His ID papers and
trigger finger will suffice.</i>

732
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:29,801
<i>I'm offering you double
the money and a one way split.</i>

733
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:34,037
<i>I believe I can trust
your mercenary greed.</i>

734
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,943
<i>Now, do we have a deal?</i>

735
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,211
Yeah.

736
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:41,912
Consider it done.

737
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:44,017
MR. FRANKLIN: <i>Good.</i>

738
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:50,787
Where'd you get ahold
of that there thing?

739
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,091
Where the fuck
did you get that?

740
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,093
Stop it, Alfred.
He's just the messenger.

741
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,694
Who is about to get very shot
on the count of three.

742
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,997
One, two...

743
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,933
Locker!
Locker in the terminal!

744
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:05,035
Black briefcase.

745
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,104
Note inside.

746
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,071
A man...
A man paid me.

747
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:10,908
An envelope with money.

748
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,176
Please don't kill me!

749
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:14,013
- Three.
- [gun clicks]

750
00:42:17,182 --> 00:42:19,750
Now fuck off.

751
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:21,220
Go on.

752
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:27,193
Fuck!

753
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:33,698
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

754
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Fucker!

755
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:38,236
[sighs]

756
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:40,171
Feel better?

757
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:42,874
[groans]

758
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,843
It's all bullshit, isn't it?

759
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:48,379
No job, no hit.

760
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:50,250
Oh, no, handsome.

761
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:55,388
There most definitely was a hit.

762
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:59,022
Me?

763
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,792
Not anymore.

764
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:03,129
We can find a new target.

765
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:06,296
We?

766
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:09,200
Now tell me something,
sugarplum.

767
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:12,837
Why should I trust you, eh?

768
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:16,207
Aren't you part of
this whole conspiracy?

769
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:18,879
I told you.

770
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:22,279
I like you.

771
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,151
I need someone
to butter my buns for.

772
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:35,826
Well, I suppose I do need
a new partner now, don't I?

773
00:43:35,828 --> 00:43:40,464
My old one seems to have
become rather untrustworthy.

774
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:42,433
But I will warn you, Alfred.

775
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:45,870
I'll need a firm hand and a
regular lash of the tongue.

776
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:49,272
I can't wait
to have you under me.

777
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:51,008
Good.

778
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,078
Let's have a cup of tea
and plot our bloody revenge.

779
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,482
You tidy that up.
I'll put the kettle on...

780
00:43:58,484 --> 00:43:59,919
partner.

781
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:13,897
The way I see it,
you've got two options.

782
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:14,932
Go on.

783
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:16,834
Option A: suicide.

784
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:18,502
I see. And B?

785
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:21,037
Well, you've got to hear
the case for Option A first.

786
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,207
- I do?
- You do.

787
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:24,475
I'm all ears.

788
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:26,310
- You're dying.
- Apparently.

789
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:28,912
- You're not happy about it.
- Not really.

790
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:30,413
You're miserable, touchy.

791
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:32,783
Quite frankly,
not great company.

792
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,051
Oh, thank you.

793
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,553
Want my advice?

794
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:36,890
No.

795
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:40,558
Just end it.

796
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,361
Have you ever considered
counseling?

797
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:45,062
Every minute of every day,

798
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:46,830
you're bombarded with
a series of hazardous

799
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:49,566
and potentially life-ending
situations to choose from.

800
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,569
Jump in front of a bus.

801
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:53,136
Have a bath with your toaster.

802
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:54,504
Fall on your butter knife.

803
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,506
Tall buildings,
rivers, bridges, trains.

804
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:58,142
There are more ways
to end your life

805
00:44:58,144 --> 00:45:00,410
than there are ways to live it.

806
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:02,412
All this pissing around
in train stations

807
00:45:02,414 --> 00:45:04,048
in the middle of the night
would be over.

808
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,484
End this nothing,
and all it takes is some balls.

809
00:45:07,486 --> 00:45:10,187
And my immortal soul?

810
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:11,923
Overrated.

811
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,457
Overrated?

812
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:19,800
Have you done something to put
your immortal soul in jeopardy?

813
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:28,939
Well, there you go then.
Nothing to worry about.

814
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:30,174
Are you Catholic?

815
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:31,375
Yeah.

816
00:45:31,377 --> 00:45:33,578
[coughing]

817
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,412
Religious?

818
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:37,582
[coughing]

819
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:40,984
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, sorry. Um...

820
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:43,486
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

821
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:45,923
To be honest, I can't recall
the last time I took confession.

822
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:49,926
I think it's more than 10,
but less than 20.

823
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,194
Days?

824
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:55,265
Months?
Not years, surely.

825
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:57,000
Don't get pissed off at me
for telling you the truth.

826
00:45:57,002 --> 00:45:58,970
That's just mean.

827
00:45:58,972 --> 00:46:01,104
If I'd known you were like this,
I would've just said three days

828
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,441
and taken my chances
with the Almighty.

829
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:05,278
[coughs]
Sorry.

830
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:09,082
That was uncalled for.
I apologize.

831
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:13,484
Are you still there?

832
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,118
[sniffing]

833
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,955
I know you're there.
I can smell sherry.

834
00:46:17,957 --> 00:46:19,156
[flicks lighter]

835
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:20,558
Define religious.

836
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,995
Lolly?

837
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:26,464
I'll take that
as a big fat no.

838
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:28,933
Maybe it's divine retribution.

839
00:46:28,935 --> 00:46:31,602
Oh, yeah, that sounds tasty.

840
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:34,604
You know,
my sins revisiting me

841
00:46:34,606 --> 00:46:37,375
and my past
coming back to haunt me...

842
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,977
I'm all ears, William.

843
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:43,050
Let me hear your confession.

844
00:46:51,457 --> 00:46:53,993
Repent and thou shalt be saved!

845
00:46:55,528 --> 00:46:57,194
That's not even from the Bible.

846
00:46:57,196 --> 00:46:59,062
Okay, that is the graffiti

847
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:01,933
that's written on the bus stop
opposite the terminal.

848
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,500
That's disappointing.

849
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:06,002
That's pretty much my entire
knowledge of scripture.

850
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:08,038
Try this one:
Repent, turn back,

851
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,374
and thy sins
will be blotted out.

852
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:12,209
Not really as catchy, is it?

853
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:14,044
[laughs]

854
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,680
How's my case
for suicide progressing?

855
00:47:15,682 --> 00:47:17,214
Am I quaking your foundations?

856
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:19,116
You're giving me a headache.

857
00:47:19,118 --> 00:47:21,118
Oh, how's this for a headache?

858
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,687
Take a pencil,
jam into tabletop,

859
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:27,024
slam head down onto pencil,
dead in five seconds.

860
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:28,725
- That's foul.
- Isn't it?

861
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:30,261
And every time
I suggest this to someone,

862
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,729
they think it goes
up your nose.

863
00:47:31,731 --> 00:47:33,497
You've suggested this
more than once?

864
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:35,499
It can't go up your nose.
That's impossible.

865
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:37,468
Think about
the trajectory involved.

866
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,102
It would go in your eyeball,
right?

867
00:47:39,104 --> 00:47:40,738
Through the socket,
into your brain.

868
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,441
I... Well, it depends on the
angle of the head, I suppose.

869
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,142
Let's test the theory.

870
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:49,013
It's not very sharp, is it?

871
00:47:49,015 --> 00:47:50,117
Use your fancy pen then.

872
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,517
It's heavier.

873
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,419
Nib's sharper than yours.

874
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:59,458
Probably get it further into
the table, better purchase.

875
00:48:01,127 --> 00:48:03,194
It would feel more proper,
wouldn't it?

876
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:04,562
More ceremonial.

877
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:08,064
A pen does have more purpose
than a pencil.

878
00:48:08,066 --> 00:48:09,232
More stature.

879
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:10,700
Definitely a better choice.

880
00:48:10,702 --> 00:48:13,671
Definitely,
and how resonantly poetic.

881
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:17,040
The English professor found
impaled on his own fountain pen.

882
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,042
It's epic.

883
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:19,075
It's inspired.

884
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:20,410
We've cracked it!

885
00:48:20,412 --> 00:48:24,080
Time, place, method,
it's all there.

886
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:26,082
Don't you think
it'd be a bit painful?

887
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:27,584
You're missing the point.

888
00:48:27,586 --> 00:48:29,053
Hmm?

889
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:30,620
Get it?

890
00:48:30,622 --> 00:48:32,790
- Brilliant.
- God, you're not very keen.

1239
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,611
Orphans always make the best
victims, don't they, William?

1240
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:10,312
But chalk-stained fingers
leave indelible marks

1241
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:12,150
on little girls' panties.

1242
01:06:13,484 --> 01:06:16,088
Consider this
divine retribution.

1243
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,665
Burn in hell.

1244
01:06:35,841 --> 01:06:39,642
Was that gun loaded,
the one you pointed at me?

1245
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:42,444
VINCE: <i>Impossible to say
either way.</i>

1246

[phone ringing]

1247
01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:47,716
- What's that?
- It's the fucking phone.

1248
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:48,686
All right.

1249
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:51,057
[ringing continues]

1250
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:55,290
Yes?

1251
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,359
Okay.

1252
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:58,329
Got it.

1253
01:07:01,533 --> 01:07:03,669
That was Mr. fucking Franklin.
It's on.

1254
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:11,808
- [phone ringing]
- [snaps fingers]

1255
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,745
Yeah.

1256
01:07:13,845 --> 01:07:14,847
[ringing continues]

1257
01:07:20,385 --> 01:07:21,750
Yes?

1258
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:24,256
ALFRED:
<i>Is this phone in range?</i>

1259
01:07:28,526 --> 01:07:30,292
VINCE:
Where's the fucking target?

1260
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:31,828
ALFRED: Why aren't you
taking a shot?

1261
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,562
There is no shot.

1262
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,298
Take the shot, Vince.
What's the problem?

1263
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,635
Shut up!

1264
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:40,770
Bottle blonde!

1265
01:07:40,772 --> 01:07:42,805
Fuck hell's she doing here?

1266
01:07:42,807 --> 01:07:45,176
<i>Gotcha.</i>

1267
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:51,749
Put the gun down, Boss.

1268
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:01,491
What the fucking hell's
going on?

1269
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:04,894
This is what we call
in the trade "a double-cross."

1270
01:08:04,896 --> 01:08:07,229
<i>Now put the gun down.</i>

1271
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:10,502
<i>And now sit at the table,
hands where I can see them.</i>

1272
01:08:15,307 --> 01:08:16,438
You all right, bottle blonde?

1273
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,340
<i>Took your time, sweetheart.</i>

1274
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:20,343
<i>Thought you actually were
gonna let him have a pop at me.</i>

1275
01:08:20,345 --> 01:08:22,978
Oh, I think he's been trying
that quite enough recently.

1276
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:24,279
<i>Stop it, Alfred.</i>

1277
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:25,415
Don't be naughty.

1278
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:26,782
<i>Sorry, sugarplum.</i>

1279
01:08:26,784 --> 01:08:28,751
Now get yourself over here.

1280
01:08:28,753 --> 01:08:31,757
Come and savor
this moment with me.

1281
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,291
[hangs up phone]

1282
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:37,426
I see you finally lost
your virginity then.

1283
01:08:37,428 --> 01:08:39,431
Congratulations.

1284
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:47,839
Hi, handsome.

1285
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:53,443
You smell different.

1286
01:08:53,445 --> 01:08:54,844
My new perfume.

1287
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:56,411
It's intoxicating.

1288
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:58,413
Oh, Jesus Christ, kill me now.

1289
01:08:58,415 --> 01:08:59,482
With pleasure.

1290
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:02,618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1291
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,687
Tell me something.

1292
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,525
What have I ever
done to you, eh?

1293
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:10,960
Vincent Escariot.

1294
01:09:10,962 --> 01:09:12,894
Tut, tut, tut.

1295
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:14,630
You'd sell your own partner
down the river

1296
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:16,566
for 30 pieces of silver.

1297
01:09:16,568 --> 01:09:19,001
I like loyalty I can buy.

1298
01:09:19,003 --> 01:09:21,339
You traitor, you.

1299
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:25,474
What the fuck's it got
to do with you?

1300
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:29,011
Now, now, Vince,
don't be rude.

1301
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:31,014
I think you've been
quite rude enough

1302
01:09:31,016 --> 01:09:32,982
to my other half recently.

1303
01:09:32,984 --> 01:09:34,983
Your girlfriend's doing all
your thinking now, is she?

1304
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:37,487
Well, fuck you...

1305
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:39,855
and your fucking whore.

1306
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:43,059
Don't you misunderstand
the situation you're in

1307
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:45,295
for one second, Vincent.

1308
01:09:45,297 --> 01:09:46,996
You'll keep a civil tongue
in your head,

1309
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:48,598
or it won't be quick and easy.

1310
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,500
It'll be slow and messy.

1311
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:53,368
You are a fucking
pain in my ass!

1312
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:54,636
As well as being
a double-crossing,

1313
01:09:54,638 --> 01:09:58,340
backstabbing,
turncoat traitor.

1314
01:09:58,342 --> 01:10:00,542
But guess what.

1315
01:10:00,544 --> 01:10:02,812
I've got a new partner now,
Vincent.

1316
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:05,415
And unlike with you,

1317
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,951
I just love it
when she fucks me.

1318
01:10:08,953 --> 01:10:11,586
This is your doing,
isn't it, bottle blonde?

1319
01:10:11,588 --> 01:10:13,755
Oh, yes, Vincent.

1320
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:16,024
I'm the master villain.

1321
01:10:16,026 --> 01:10:18,995
VINCE: Fucking crazy.

1322
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:22,098
The pair of you,
you're both mad, delusional.

1323
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,401
Fuck you
and your fucking whore!

1324
01:10:25,403 --> 01:10:28,307
You don't have to let him
talk to us like that, handsome.

1325
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:32,910
No.

1326
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,886
Your eyes. I saw them...

1327
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:46,022
Bye, Vince.

1328
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:47,726
[Alfred laughs]

1329
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,064
- That was fun.
- It was brilliant.

1330
01:10:54,598 --> 01:10:57,367
Right. I need a shower
and a change of clothes,

1331
01:10:57,369 --> 01:10:59,434
and then I'm taking you
out to dinner.

1332
01:10:59,436 --> 01:11:00,702
My treat.

1333
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:03,773
Our first proper date.

1334
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,878
Bye-bye, sugarplum.

1335
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:13,385
Bye, handsome.

1336
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:37,476
[knocking]

1337
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,749
Ah! Cleaning service.

1338
01:11:45,516 --> 01:11:47,783
I'll have the works,
please, mate.

1339
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:50,489
The full spit and polish.

1340
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,627
Here's a cherry on top.

1341
01:11:56,694 --> 01:11:59,461
Call it an apologetic token

1342
01:11:59,463 --> 01:12:02,467
for the little overreaction
the other night, eh?

1343
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:09,140
See you later, Supe.

1344
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:18,784
Ohh...

1345
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:32,495
Hi, handsome.

1346
01:12:32,497 --> 01:12:34,098
Hello, sugarplum.

1347
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:41,970
Did you get
your homework done?

1348
01:12:41,972 --> 01:12:44,740
- Top of the class.
- Smart girl!

1349
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:47,643
I've got a little
surprise for you.

1350
01:12:47,645 --> 01:12:50,078
Are you wearing that stripper
getup under that red coat?

1351
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,516
Stockings, suspenders?

1352
01:12:54,785 --> 01:12:58,489
You know, you really do
have such a lovely jaw.

1353
01:13:01,758 --> 01:13:04,594
Wait right here.

1354
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:06,464
Yeah.

1355
01:13:33,223 --> 01:13:34,193
Hello?

1356
01:13:43,066 --> 01:13:44,168
Sugarplum.

1357
01:13:47,105 --> 01:13:48,106
Sugarplum.

[click]

1359
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:54,109
I really hate that nickname.

1360
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:57,712
Drop the gun,
hands up where I can see them.

1361
01:13:57,714 --> 01:13:59,549
One wrong move, handsome,

1362
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,216
you'll have that gaping
exit wound in your face

1363
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:03,219
we talked about.

1364
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:04,756
Drop it.

1365
01:14:06,925 --> 01:14:08,526
Kick it away.

1366
01:14:10,861 --> 01:14:12,196
Good boy.

1367
01:14:13,664 --> 01:14:15,063
I thought we were partners.

1368
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:16,767
I've already got a partner.

1369
01:14:18,302 --> 01:14:21,269
Cripple?
[laughs]

1370
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:23,072
So all of this was, what?

1371
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:26,175
An overelaborate scheme
perpetrated mercilessly upon you

1372
01:14:26,177 --> 01:14:29,144
by highly motivated, highly
intelligent individuals...

1373
01:14:29,146 --> 01:14:31,680
With a penchant
for amateur dramatics.

1374
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:32,717
It's pronounced <i>penchant.</i>

1375
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,719
You are correct, Alfred.

1376
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,621
Two weeks you had me
in that fucking apartment,

1377
01:14:39,623 --> 01:14:42,858
waiting to kill someone
who was waiting to kill me.

1378
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,960
- Why?
- Because we like to have

1379
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,895
all our dollies
lined up on the shelf.

1380
01:14:46,897 --> 01:14:48,197
Shit!

01:14:54,771 --> 01:14:58,640
And... you never
really liked me?

1384
01:14:58,642 --> 01:15:00,846
Me? No.

1385
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:04,779
Has anyone ever told you

1386
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:07,215
that you are a two-faced,

1387
01:15:07,217 --> 01:15:09,885
treacherous, manipulative,

1388
01:15:09,887 --> 01:15:12,787
callous little bitch?

1389
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:15,726
Oh, you have no idea.

1390
01:15:17,128 --> 01:15:19,362
[laughs]

1391
01:15:19,364 --> 01:15:23,001
Annie, darling, I don't
suppose you'd consider...

1392
01:15:26,837 --> 01:15:27,972
No.

1393
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:39,648
Look, I know
you wanted to keep him,

1394
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:42,417
but we got bigger
fish to fry, okay?

1395
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:45,623
I've got the ID papers.
Give me his gun.

[yelps]

1397
01:15:48,426 --> 01:15:51,093
Stand and deliver!

1398
01:15:51,095 --> 01:15:52,995
Oh, Christ!

1399
01:15:52,997 --> 01:15:55,200
You nearly gave me
a heart attack.

1400
01:15:57,935 --> 01:16:00,402
You're early.

1401
01:16:00,404 --> 01:16:02,203
Give me that gun.

1402
01:16:02,205 --> 01:16:04,309
Where'd you put Vincent?

1403
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,814
What you gonna do
with them both?

1404
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:14,050
Can we chuck them
in the river?

1405
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:15,287
No.

1406
01:16:17,187 --> 01:16:19,757
I've got a better idea.
Give me a hand.

of tumbling downstairs.

Yes?

<i>It's done, Mr. Franklin.</i>

1419
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:50,131
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Both of them.

1420
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:51,367
<i>Good.</i>

1421
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:55,270
And the little favor,
the teacher?

1422
01:19:55,272 --> 01:19:57,305
I'm forever in your debt.

1423
01:19:57,307 --> 01:19:59,474
Did you have fun, sweetie?

1424
01:19:59,476 --> 01:20:01,143
It was like jelly and ice cream.

1425
01:20:01,145 --> 01:20:02,611

- Mum's the word.

- All right, son?
- Cleaning service.

1429
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:10,286
He has his uses.

1430
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:12,991
Are you suitably impressed,
Mr. Franklin?

1431
01:20:14,557 --> 01:20:16,024
Most definitely.

1432
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:17,292
<i>Good.</i>

1433
01:20:17,294 --> 01:20:19,361
So I can rely
on your business then?

1434
01:20:19,363 --> 01:20:22,697
I have a limited
range of choice.

1435
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:26,237
You've suppressed
the competition admirably.

1436
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,340
How do I know you're not
going to double-cross me?

1437
01:20:31,342 --> 01:20:33,142
<i>You seem very adept at it.</i>

1438
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:35,544
MR. FRANKLIN:
<i>How, indeed. But remember,</i>

1439
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:37,645
<i>I like loyalty I can buy,</i>

1440
01:20:37,647 --> 01:20:40,482
<i>and you are unique.</i>

1441
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:43,385
<i>You're one of a kind.</i>

1442
01:20:43,387 --> 01:20:45,891
You have proved
your value to me.

1443
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:52,594
So is this the start of
a beautiful relationship then?

1444
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:55,133
Most definitely.

1445
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,636

Excellent.

1449
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:41,443
What do you want?

1450
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:43,077
There are two things in life

1451
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:45,417
for which we are never
truly prepared.

1452
01:21:48,552 --> 01:21:49,487

1453
01:21:58,262 --> 01:22:01,599
Well, well, well, he lives.

1454
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:07,338
I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin,
is the light bothering you?

1455
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:13,742
Where am I?

1456
01:22:13,744 --> 01:22:16,181
You like what we've

1458
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:29,390
A woman's touch
is what was needed.

1459
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:32,161
How... How the fuck did you...

1460
01:22:32,163 --> 01:22:35,096
Look through the looking glass,
Mr. Franklin.

1461
01:22:35,098 --> 01:22:37,733
Or shall we call you...

1462
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,434
Clinton?

A rose by any other name.

1464
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:43,772
You've tumbled down
the rabbit hole

1465
01:22:43,774 --> 01:22:46,541

or rhyme or reason,

1467
01:22:48,611 --> 01:22:51,546
You're mad!
Stark raving mad!

Oh, we can't help that,
said the cat.

1469
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:54,582
We're all mad here.

1470
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,186
I'm mad. You're mad.

1471
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,853
Have you ever read it?

1472
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:00,090
It's our favorite book.

1473
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:04,225
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

1474
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:06,394
Mommy used to read it to us
every night.

1475
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:08,096
We know it front to back,
cover to cover.

1476

Inside and out.

1477
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:11,532
If you gave us
a page and a line,

1478
01:23:11,534 --> 01:23:14,103
we could give you the words,
verbatim.

1479
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:15,470
We hear tell it's hereditary.

1480
01:23:15,472 --> 01:23:16,671
Like eye color.

1481
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:18,474
Or homicidal impulse.

1482
01:23:18,476 --> 01:23:20,408
Blood will out.

1483
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:23,778
May we tell you a story,
Mr. Franklin?

1484
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:27,381
Are you sitting comfortably?

1485
01:23:27,383 --> 01:23:29,686
- Then let us begin.
- Then let us begin.

1486
01:23:31,387 --> 01:23:35,590
A long time ago in a place
not dissimilar to this,

1487
01:23:35,592 --> 01:23:39,460
as a point of fact,
identical to this,

1488
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:45,134
there lived a young woman
called Chloe Merriweather.

1489
01:23:45,136 --> 01:23:48,636
Now, Chloe Merriweather
had a gleam in her eye.

1490
01:23:48,638 --> 01:23:52,140
She wanted adventure.

1491
01:23:52,142 --> 01:23:55,611
One night in the aptly named
Anything Goes,

1492
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:58,147
Chloe Merriweather
succumbed to the wiles

1493
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:01,183
of one Clinton Sharp,
a low-level criminal

1494
01:24:01,185 --> 01:24:03,652
with aspirations of grandeur,

1495
01:24:03,654 --> 01:24:06,688
who whispered sweet nothings
in her ear

1496
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:10,759
and kept her drink topped up
and his powder dry.

1497
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:14,795
Theirs was a knee-trembling
relationship.

1498
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:18,332
Then for a time, very little
was heard of Chloe Merriweather

1499
01:24:18,334 --> 01:24:21,335
until a year or so later
she reappeared.

1500
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:24,872
She'd grown up,
like all little girls do.

1501
01:24:24,874 --> 01:24:28,309
She waited tables by day,

1502
01:24:28,311 --> 01:24:30,578
and she danced on them
by night.

1503
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:34,683
For Chloe had a secret
that nobody knew

1504
01:24:34,685 --> 01:24:37,585
buried deep within
her heart of hearts.

1505
01:24:37,587 --> 01:24:41,322
She had two little girls
at home.

1506
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:42,890
Twins.

1507
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:46,230
The result of her passionate
tryst with Mr. Sharp.

1508
01:24:48,766 --> 01:24:50,468
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

1509
01:24:53,803 --> 01:24:56,871
But Chloe Merriweather knew
better than to involve Clinton

1510
01:24:56,873 --> 01:24:58,907
in her daughters' lives,

1511
01:24:58,909 --> 01:25:02,544
for she had seen
the shadow in his soul,

1512
01:25:02,546 --> 01:25:04,414
the murder in his eyes.

1513
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:09,984
She kept them hidden
from the world

1514
01:25:09,986 --> 01:25:12,487
and from Clinton Sharp.

1515
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:15,624
Deliciously sweet
were those times.

1516
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:18,727
But life is cruel,
and the world is small,

1517
01:25:18,729 --> 01:25:21,630
and fate laughs mercilessly
at us all.

1518
01:25:21,632 --> 01:25:25,767
One deep, dark night,

1519
01:25:25,769 --> 01:25:30,538
Chloe Merriweather saw something
she ought not to have seen.

1522
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,854
Chloe Merriweather
ran for her life

1523
01:25:46,856 --> 01:25:49,860
through that deep, dark night.

1524
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:54,662
But it wasn't long
before Clinton Sharp

1525
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:57,366
came calling for Chloe

1526
01:25:57,368 --> 01:25:59,667
with a canister of petrol

1527
01:25:59,669 --> 01:26:01,705
and his cigarette lighter.

1528
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:10,578
Rumor has it
he whistled while he worked.

[whistling "Danny Boy"]

1530
01:26:15,686 --> 01:26:18,553
But Chloe Merriweather
was a fighter,

1531
01:26:18,555 --> 01:26:20,822
a wildcat with fierce tears,

1532
01:26:20,824 --> 01:26:23,591
unwilling to go gently
into that good night.

1533
01:26:23,593 --> 01:26:25,893
Chloe saved her little girls,

1534
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:29,363
but the wildcat could not
get herself to safety.

1535
01:26:29,365 --> 01:26:31,802
[Chloe screaming]

1536
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:43,411
And so it was we found ourselves
wards of the precinct,

1537
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:45,647
taken into the mercy
and kindness

1538

of St. Catherine's Orphanage.

1539
01:26:48,485 --> 01:26:51,886
To the welcoming arms of
the priests and the teachers

1540
01:26:51,888 --> 01:26:54,855
with their wandering hands
and their sticky fingers.

1541
01:26:54,857 --> 01:26:58,794
Here we learned how to close
our eyes and bite our lips.

1542
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,462
We learned how to go elsewhere
in our hearts and our heads

1543
01:27:01,464 --> 01:27:03,564
when the lights went out.

1544
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:05,567
As soon as our legs
would carry us,

1545
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:07,902
we ran far, far away.

1546
01:27:07,904 --> 01:27:10,538
Survival was
all we hoped for.

1547
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,474
A feral existence.

1548
01:27:12,476 --> 01:27:15,510
Until one day,
who should we see

and his broom and his limp,

That selfsame whistle

1554

that had haunted
our nightmares for so long.

1555
01:27:37,767 --> 01:27:40,068
So we hunted you, Daddy,

1556
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:44,038
and before long, we discovered
your clever little secret.

mystery's a lost art?

And we let you track us, Daddy,
as we tracked you.

1566

Inch by inch,
we laid our plans against you.

1567

We baited our traps
and cast our lures.

We pulled the strings
that made you dance.

1569

We knew exactly
what would get your attention

1570

hearing our confession.

I've been a naughty girl.</i>

<i>Meet me at
St. Catherine's Church.</i>

1574
01:28:42,432 --> 01:28:45,032
MR. FRANKLIN: This is
a well-conceived venue.

1575
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:48,469
I want your work,
your contracts, all of it.

1576
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,104
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

1577
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:53,809
I've been recommended
another interested party

1578
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:55,143
to take care of my problems.

1579
01:28:55,145 --> 01:28:57,813
I'm better.

1580
01:28:57,815 --> 01:28:59,814
I highly doubt it.

1581
01:28:59,816 --> 01:29:04,853
You men, with your bad suits
and your pumiced hair,

1582
01:29:04,855 --> 01:29:07,855
you're utterly predictable.

1583
01:29:07,857 --> 01:29:10,125
I reckon to the point
of carelessness.

1584
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:11,526
Yes.

1585
01:29:11,528 --> 01:29:12,893
Me?

1586
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:15,831
I'm the switchblade
in the garters,

I'm the surprise
they never see coming.

1589
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:25,607
Who says mystery's a lost art?

1590
01:29:25,609 --> 01:29:27,509
Who'd have thought?

1591
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,446
We're Daddy's little girls,
after all.

1592
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:37,518
And now we stand on
the brink of our vengeance,

1593
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,557
on the cusp
of the wildest of justice.

1594
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:44,960
You are my daughters, yeah?

1595
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,595
In blood only, Daddy.

1596
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:49,197
Don't get too attached.

1597
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,666
Mommy has to be avenged.

1598
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:54,702
Tell us, Daddy, are you familiar
with the science of lobotomy?

1599
01:29:54,704 --> 01:29:56,705
Much maligned
in this day and age,

1600
01:29:56,707 --> 01:29:59,573
but somehow rather
fitting in this scenario,

1601
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:00,575
don't you think?

1602
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,510
Please, girls.

1603
01:30:02,512 --> 01:30:04,712
Anything.
I'll do anything.

1604
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:07,215
But not this, please!
Not this.

1605
01:30:07,217 --> 01:30:10,585
I beseech you
in your mother's name!

1606
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:12,019
I am your father!

1607
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:15,290
No, no, no.
Far too little, far too late.

1608
01:30:15,292 --> 01:30:17,626
- [screams]
- Shh, Daddy, easy.

1609
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:20,127
I've got you.
Try not to fight.

1610
01:30:20,129 --> 01:30:22,130
The time has come,
the walrus said,

1611
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:24,064
to speak of many things,

1612
01:30:24,066 --> 01:30:27,768
like shoes and ships
and sealing wax,

1613
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:30,173
cabbages and kings.

1614
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:34,177
[screaming]

1615
01:30:37,146 --> 01:30:39,781
An eye for an eye, Daddy.

1616
01:30:39,783 --> 01:30:45,122
[screaming]

1617
01:30:47,324 --> 01:30:49,758
The coup de grâce
is yours, dear sister.

1618
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,561
The nail in the coffin.

1619
01:30:55,565 --> 01:30:57,934
Send Mr. Franklin
to Wonderland.

1620
01:31:06,743 --> 01:31:08,044
Night-night, Daddy.

1621
01:31:18,922 --> 01:31:20,889
