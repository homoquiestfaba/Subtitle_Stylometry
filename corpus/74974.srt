Subtitle: TRISTAR Team...

2
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,065
It was a nightmare.
So many dead people.

3
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,140
So many victims.

4
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:32,844
Everything began some days ago behind,
when I came here.

5
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,386
And the remains are still rotting
and smelling of death.

6
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,318
That good.

7
00:02:14,526 --> 00:02:16,342
Then that make?
We will lose the ship.

8
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:18,127
Greg and Simon.

9
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:23,574
Greg played baseball in the school.
Good type, only half stupid.

10
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:28,805
Simon, they say that God was generous
with him, and it is true.

11
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,752
He is comely, but
he doesn't have brain.

12
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:37,867
Cynthia, girlfriend of Greg.
A beauty.

13
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,358
Karma. She is brown
and exuberant.

14
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,075
She likes of Simon.

15
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,263
But Simon only has eyes
for Alicia, my former one.

16
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:51,585
We have finished for some weeks,
for me to be able to study and her to leave.

17
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,686
She adores that. I don't know which is the advantage.

18
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,497
You don't have one of those
invitations with map?

19
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,111
For sure the ship comes out of here?
Didn't they give you a missed information?

20
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,120
Here he says that the ship
it leaves at 17:00 o'clock.

21
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,150
Yes, and now they are 17:15 Simon.

22
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:16,937
Shit, we are shitted.

23
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:18,750
They lost the ship
for the party.

24
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,151
They had decided to stay
in Seattle, they would be alive today.

25
00:04:16,406 --> 00:04:19,213
Incredible, hard the weekend
integer, you have to see it.

26
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,333
To that don't guess
who is here?

27
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,264
Hello?

28
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:28,160
The reception is horrible here.
Do tell me, dear, are you there?

29
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:29,502
Hello?

30
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:31,439
Shit.

31
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,088
Where you wanted to take me?

32
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:47,362
I was attempting
to make my paper of single.

33
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,223
But something in my head told me
that something was not well.

34
00:04:58,754 --> 00:04:59,302
Hello?

35
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,355
That you are making here?

36
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:09,697
Good afternoon,
beautiful day, certain?

37
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,560
You have some problem
of audition?

38
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:14,524
I asked you a question

39
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:17,040
We wanted to rent
their ship, Mister.

40
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:18,754
Does that want, not?

41
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:20,944
But it is a pain.

42
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,350
This is a fishing ship,
not a floating Casino.

43
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,930
Why you don't look for
in the yellow pages?

44
00:05:26,437 --> 00:05:30,180
We have to go to a party in an island,
and we hoped to use their ship.

45
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,391
Are not you hearing me, not?

46
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:36,658
I already said outside.
Or don't you speak English?

47
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:41,812
Why doesn't he say their price and do we leave this? Does a man need to
eat, not?

48
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,732
- That leaves of it was you didn't understand?
- Wait.

49
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,711
- Jesus, arrived
the Commandant...

50
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,740
- As much as you offer?
-that? - How much?

51
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,105
US $are 300 well?

52
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,750
But are 600 more, not?

53
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,021
- 600? No, it is a robbery.
- Nobody spoke with you.

54
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,560
For where they go?

55
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:08,478
I don't know, we have a map, it is an island.
You will know where it is, Captain.

56
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:12,471
Is it crazy? They are crazy.

57
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,278
No, I believe that not.

58
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,401
Pardon?

59
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,262
- I said, forget it.
- That, forget it.

60
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,399
- Forget it. He already stops to speak and veto.
- Why?

61
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:26,769
- Why? Why do they always ask?
- Does he know like they call that island?

62
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:28,958
"Island of the Death"

63
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:30,483
Death.

64
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:32,732
It is death in Spanish.

65
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:34,865
But I believe that you don't speak to Mexican.

66
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:38,365
- Friends, I have the money here.
If they are trying to win more...

67
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,994
- He are not.

68
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:45,733
Money doesn't exist in the world
that he makes us return there.

69
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:48,862
- Keep the money. Keep the money. - We will leave of here.

70
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:50,040
Curse.
That they are 1000.

71
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,673
I give you US $500 now,
and US $500 in the turn.

72
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:01,535
- You are very persuasive, Mister...
- Cruise. Sam Cruise.

73
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,641
My name is Kirk.

74
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,100
Captain Kirk?

75
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,627
Is he then Spock?

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,838
I don't like them of the jokes
with captain Kirk.

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,312
Better you are quiet the mouth,

78
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,882
before you say something
that you are sorry.

79
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,834
Captain? Captain?

80
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:39,168
I don't go. There are spirits
wicked in that island.

81
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:44,004
He prepares the ship and he leaves that me
do worry of the spirits, ok Salish?

82
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,937
Captain Kirk, is the control
of the marine of the USA.

83
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,983
Await for
inspection, captain.

84
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,298
Shit.

85
00:07:58,949 --> 00:07:59,706
That he will make?

86
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,425
I don't have election.
I have to obey.

87
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,555
We will be late a little.

88
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,521
To be late? As much as time?

89
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:15,283
I imagine that they are looking for
you arm, drugs, I don't know that.

90
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:19,360
It will take some hours.
That if they didn't find anything.

91
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:24,617
- As much as he wants to lose them?
- Simon?

92
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,923
- Can you lose them, certain?
- Undoubtedly I can.

93
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,779
Of as much as we are speaking?

94
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,970
Make it.

95
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:43,096
It is an inspection
of routine, captain.

96
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,654
Neither think of abandoning the one
port. Where he goes with that ship?

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,937
Here Casper, the ship nine
he is escaping, change.

98
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,455
You didn't notice it, boy,
but I would have made it free.

99
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,341
I like to make of
Time Popeye in when.

100
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:11,735
Then already he did escape before from her?

101
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,293
Of course.

102
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,798
It is this way since
we serve together,

103
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,628
but she continued working
for the Tío Sam.

104
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:25,005
It is a game that her
pursue me, you know.

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,952
That beautiful. We go.

106
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:45,356
Do we go where?

107
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:46,719
We will swim.

108
00:09:51,618 --> 00:09:52,067
You are crazy.

109
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,048
Oh, affection!

110
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:07,288
We go there.

111
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:09,094
Of agreement.

112
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,471
My God.
It is very cold, affection.

113
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:30,388
He walks, we go.

114
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:35,575
- No, you go you love.
- this well.

115
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,024
Why don't you enter? They come, Matt.
You are very boring.

116
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,452
They are going for the Island
of the Death, captain.

117
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,923
Only maintain the speed
and the distance.

118
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:54,505
I don't want that they see each other, still.

119
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:19,403
- It should have been something that I ate.
- this well, doesn't interest me.

120
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,321
Be icy!

121
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:32,596
Greg, you are very bad. Tomato another
beer, you will feel better

122
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,500
- It returns here.
- We go, Matt.

123
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,057
We go, Matt,
he stops to play.

124
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,048
Matt, where you are?

125
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,023
Matt?

126
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:36,163
That dirt.

127
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,216
Good view, pervert?

128
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,494
He wanted to give you this.

129
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:46,326
So that?

130
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,129
For protection.

131
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,249
It is well, I take pills.

132
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:52,745
To move away bad spirits.

133
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,653
To protect them to tí
and your friends of the danger.

134
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:59,344
As it is, Gandalf.

135
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,504
Matt, where you are?

136
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,123
Matt, I am lost,
where you are?

137
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,466
That this is?

138
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:30,831
Matt?

139
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:35,447
Matt?

140
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,649
That that is?

141
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,471
Matt,estas there inside?

142
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,591
Matt, these there inside?

143
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,484
Are you your, Matt?

144
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:06,750
Matt?

145
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:27,014
Matt?

146
00:15:29,086 --> 00:15:29,677
Matt?

147
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,214
Matt!

148
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,340
Matt!

149
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,634
Matt! Oh, my God!

150
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:59,580
- Captain, we come closer.
- But mantén distances to see where they go.

151
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:15,019
Did you -listen that?
-that?

152
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:52,118
- Captain, dilutes not very deep.
- Ok, Salish.

153
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,475
Hey, boys, there are.

154
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,227
Now calm.
almost we arrive.

155
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,624
Captain? turn off the motors.

156
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,573
I know where they go.
Leave me to the other side of the island.

157
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:38,298
- He wants him to call reinforcements.
- Not. I can be in charge of of alone Viktor.

158
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:50,623
That we will make now?

159
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:55,890
We go. Good place
for our merchandise.

160
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:57,595
It begins to discharge.

161
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:02,363
If Casper comes behind us,
he didn't find anything to accuse us.

162
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,009
It is here.

163
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:21,232
wait. It lets him to see that.

164
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,347
- Obviously you are not a cartographer.
- That sews?

165
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:28,760
We go, it is here.

166
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:34,036
- Is it quite clever, certain?
- it is true.

167
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,313
As clever as for not entering
with somebody as your.

168
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,905
It seems that somebody happens here.

169
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,019
This old one.

170
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,674
Captain, captain.

171
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,240
It seems that he comes
a storm.

172
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,309
It seems that yes.
But there is not problem.

173
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,355
It will maintain
to Casper far

174
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,361
if he tries to come after
us. We will be able to escape.

175
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,019
And the boys?

176
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,133
We cannot leave them
alone. This island is bad.

177
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,135
I won't wait
for them.

178
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:42,141
Not if we have one
opportunity to escape from Casper.

179
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,847
- It continues discharging.
- This well, captain.

180
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:48,596
Very well. We will return
next week,

181
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,612
when the
does pressure happen, yes?

182
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,538
- Do I listen something, captain?
- No, anything.

183
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:14,598
Where all are?

184
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:17,509
I cannot believe this.

185
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:23,727
Problem of them, in this place
one can dance, and I will take advantage of it.

186
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:29,913
- I don't know if it is a good idea.
- He knew that you would say that. Be not silly.

187
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,356
- I remember when it was amusing.
- When, in the garden of infants?

188
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,323
This bloodstained one.

189
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,019
It seems that something bad happens here.

190
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:44,442
As what?

191
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:58,601
- We don't need go to buy
beer, the barrel is full. - Let us see!

192
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,519
- A toast.
- Chin-chin.

193
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:01,480
Health.

194
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,364
Is not this bothering anybody?

195
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,567
In the island there would be a party,
but all desert is.

196
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:17,310
I worry about it. I worry about there to be
so much drink that we won't be able to her to take.

197
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,230
You are right, friend.

198
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,836
I don't know you, but I will attempt
to discover where all are.

199
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,307
Somebody more he comes?

200
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,595
No, I and Cynthia will play
music the whole night, non doll?

201
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,863
Ok, I go with you. I will be
diabetic with so much sweetness here.

202
00:22:32,188 --> 00:22:35,897
- And your, boy? - I won't stay,
I go with you.

203
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:39,163
That good, here this the man
strong that will protect us

204
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,038
Fair what we need,
a really strong man.

205
00:22:42,098 --> 00:22:43,210
Certain. We go.

206
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,107
I always have that
to be in charge of of the load?

207
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:22,201
Captain? Captain, are you?

208
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,630
Hello everybody!

209
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:42,548
- Towards that. - Why?

210
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,949
- Because I want sex.
- Do you want sex?

211
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:55,050
I believe that it will rain.

212
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,903
I believe that he goes to
to rain. Why not...

213
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:02,703
we go to a place where
don't let us wet ourselves?

214
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,142
But late.

215
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:18,450
We will close. Velcro, beautiful velcro.
We go to the nuesto, baby.

216
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:25,954
1, 2, 3.

217
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,377
- wait, wait. And if they return?
- I can make it quick.

218
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,553
Would not a novelty be?

219
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,940
It is not personal, Greg.
Several men have that problem.

220
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,015
- I need to urinate.
- See to make in the overgrowth.

221
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:50,300
He listens, I only want to urinate.
I will make in some place.

222
00:24:59,057 --> 00:24:59,541
Hello?

223
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,107
It is so calm.

224
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:08,018
It is a beautiful night, why
don't we have a good time?

225
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,307
Have a good time alone, Simon.

226
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,815
Because it will use that stupid accent?
- I don't know it.

227
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,698
Salish, did you already finish?

228
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:42,653
Salish?

229
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:31,528
Greg? They come soon, dear,
I am waiting.

230
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,010
Greg?

231
00:26:39,192 --> 00:26:39,804
Greg?

232
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:50,147
Greg?

233
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,530
Greg? Me these scaring.

234
00:26:56,236 --> 00:26:57,798
Greg, towards that.

235
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,595
See that.

236
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:11,300
That devils that is?

237
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,391
It seems to have been built
millennia ago.

238
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,500
Simon, centuries.

239
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,145
Certain, that was it
that I meant.

240
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,182
Will we be able to enter?

241
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:28,852
- I don't enter there.
- Me neither. It is alone, baby.

242
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,306
They come or I will have
that to enter alone?

243
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:34,798
Do you never dress Scooby-Doo?

244
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:38,115
It is not a good idea.

245
00:27:43,743 --> 00:27:46,699
I am completely in
against of making this.

246
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:58,217
The brands are fastened.
Somebody should have at home.

247
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,217
Hello?

248
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:16,182
Alicia, care.

249
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,093
That shit this is?

250
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,054
Alicia that devils
they are making here.

251
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:29,001
- Where all are?
- He closes the door.

252
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:33,444
It broke my glasses.
That Well

253
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Ok that is happening here?

254
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,230
I will show them.

255
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,939
They come.

256
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,461
I have all engraving.

257
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,855
Excuse, buenisima was.
I will advance it.

258
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:06,625
We were drinking, dancing
and having a good time, and suddenly...

259
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,968
Those things arrived and they began
to kill everybody.

260
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:16,404
Those that could escape,
we went to the ship, but it was sunken.

261
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,634
Those things continued
arriving and killing.

262
00:29:20,063 --> 00:29:22,519
Finally we find
this house and we enter.

263
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,976
tried to hide
when you arrived.

264
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,372
- We think that they were more than them.
- Who are they?

265
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:31,573
Who? I try to know it.

266
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,615
- They are dead people.
- You saw the tape.

267
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:39,903
I cannot believe it, but they are left revived bodies of a movie of Rosemary."

268
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,159
Left from where?

269
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:45,712
Of George Rosemary's movie.
The trilogy of the Night of the Alive Deads.

270
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,761
They say that they will make another movie,
ero I doubt it.

271
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:51,488
It is I very difficult to believe this.

272
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:55,721
- It is a mischief, it leaves of the party.
- It is not a mischief, Alicia.

273
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,847
I say that we should
to leave of here.

274
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,846
Let us leave that the police
take charge of this,

275
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:02,845
we will arrive to Seattle
before they discover us.

276
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,518
This well.
Do you have a ship?

277
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
- Yes, in the beach.
- Thanks to God.

278
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,461
Let us don't lose time, we go.

279
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,029
We are not able to, still
we have friends there

280
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,602
in the party, not
we will abandon them.

281
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,637
- We have to leave of
here while we can.

282
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,674
- Not without them.

283
00:30:18,737 --> 00:30:19,309
We go.

284
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:59,097
Then, did you come with that girl?

285
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:04,192
I go to give you a hint,
I believe that she is not an American.

286
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:06,778
I met her in the party.

287
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:12,044
And your boy, with smile of
Tom Cruise and brain of Rain Man?

288
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,525
He is one of the best
models from America, if you wanted to know.

289
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,476
congratulations.

290
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:20,980
- That well.
- Are you well, Simon?

291
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,847
Clear.

292
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:37,922
Where devils entered?

293
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:42,449
- Greg? Cindy?
- Please, don't make that.

294
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,087
Don't worry.
This is only a joke.

295
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,880
If you had been here not
you would say that it is a joke, believe me.

296
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,877
Hey, boys that that is?

297
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,605
- Me that I won't play that.
- Sustain it.

298
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,155
We will give it turn.

299
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:09,208
Liberty.

300
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:24,823
But that shit step with you?

301
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:27,856
It was there inside of and
suddenly I heard a roar,

302
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:30,721
he fell
and be caught.

303
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:35,239
- Shit!
- Are you full with shit, not?

304
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:36,534
Very amusing.

305
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,346
But that ...quién you are?

306
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,287
Where this Cindy?

307
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,882
I don't know, why
don't you tell it to me?

308
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,624
We have to find it.

309
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:01,299
Cindy?

310
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:08,867
Of where that shit came?

311
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,433
That that is? Oh, my God.

312
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:16,451
that that is? Cynthia?

313
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:19,669
No! No! That...

314
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:23,472
That devils were that thing?

315
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,557
Our best friend

316
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:26,923
It is no longer more it.

317
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,269
It seemed a wild animal.

318
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:33,977
Did they see their face?
My God, was horrible.

319
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:37,760
- That pass with her?
- Wait an instant.

320
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:39,788
Perhaps I get some answers.

321
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,134
McGyvers, respond.

322
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:46,692
Here Casper. Respond, change.

323
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:51,559
I won't get anything in the radio.
Does somebody have a cellular one?

324
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:55,050
we already attempt, it doesn't work.
He has some interference type.

325
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,126
I don't know that it is happening,
but it is necessary to leave the island.

326
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,548
As they arrived here?

327
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:04,540
In ship, as all, but
it is not, it was destroyed.

328
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,894
Ours not. We arrive last, with Kirk. - Where he is?

329
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,574
- It is in the bay.
- Can you take me until him?

330
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,576
-AND the rest?
-for now not.

331
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:16,322
Now only I want to take them
him but far for its well

332
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,902
It is a good plan for me.

333
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:53,264
- I am so afraid, Simon.
- I know it, me also.

334
00:35:58,014 --> 00:36:00,201
I cannot believe that
Cynthia is dead.

335
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:08,677
I sit down it a lot, Alicia.

336
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,005
Still.

337
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:53,710
All still ones

338
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:17,302
shit.

339
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,940
- We can go home
now, please?

340
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:36,672
- We will leave
of here! Let us go!

341
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,090
Move! Let us go!

342
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:51,563
Let us go!

343
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,925
shit! Kirk?

344
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:08,487
- We will look for Kirk.
- He has to be here!

345
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:11,585
- Kirk?
- That. Kirk?

346
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:14,443
- Kirk? - Kirk?

347
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,626
Kirk? My God,
that is not Kirk.

348
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,847
-where Simon goes?
- Simon, don't jump to the water.

349
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,902
Simon!

350
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:36,692
Shoot them!

351
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:39,268
Behind yours!

352
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:47,583
No! Liberty!

353
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:24,179
- Shoot!
- That you believe that I am making, imbecile?

354
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:53,527
They come.

355
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:01,371
It returns of where
you came, shit.

356
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,670
- My face!
- Allow me to see you.

357
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,900
- Can you give me your coat?
- Curse! God that shit!

358
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:21,438
Curse.

359
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,114
Are you medical?

360
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:28,402
- I made a course of first aids.
- First aids, am there?

361
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,385
At least I met him healthy.

362
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:35,760
Oh, my God. Allow me to see.

363
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,014
- Was a bite?
- Yes.

364
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,742
This well.

365
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:45,594
I have to return to the ship it patrols
to request help for radio.

366
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,507
Wait, he will leave us here
while it looks for the chivalry?

367
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,621
No, you come with me.

368
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:52,148
Me? Why me?

369
00:41:53,193 --> 00:41:54,527
- Are you medical?
- Not.

370
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,476
- Is it wounded?
- Not.

371
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:58,606
Does he know how to use a weapon?
For that reason you come.

372
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,690
The ship this
of the other side.

373
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:03,382
We will try to arrive and
to request aid, expert?

374
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,514
We go.

375
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:08,369
- Greg. My name is Greg.
- Walking, Greg.

376
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,108
That devils were those things?

377
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,876
I don't know, but now I know because they call
to this island Island of the Death"

378
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:23,202
I have to make this.
I need to make it

379
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:27,327
It should have some type of
scientific explanation for this

380
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,070
Liberty is right.
They should have suffered some mutation.

381
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:36,117
That? For the hole of ozone?
Didn't they use solar protector?

382
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:39,047
They are zombis and final point.

383
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:42,079
While sooner
let us accept that,

384
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:43,851
more opportunity will have
of leaving of here alive.

385
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:48,471
Captain, its
sailor believed that...

386
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:50,550
you wise something
on the island that was?

387
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,804
- Anything besides legends.
- As that of the dead-alive ones?

388
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,996
Well, for that that
I remember of the history,

389
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:05,594
there was a
Crazy Spanish " father ".

390
00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:10,143
It was banished of Spain,
centuries ago.

391
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,369
Their name was Castillo Sermano.

392
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,222
Did you ask to see me, Padre Castillo?

393
00:43:39,449 --> 00:43:42,934
He comes more fence, captain,
I cannot see their face.

394
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:46,396
Is he afraid, captain?

395
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:54,748
He knows why I was
exile from Spain?

396
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:59,648
- Their experiments were not of God.
- God?

397
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,416
That he made God for you, or for me?

398
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:05,460
Anything.

399
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:14,112
- Any God doesn't exist. Only me.
- That He has pity of their soul.

400
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,536
The Spaniards attempted
to reach the coast.

401
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,601
They never arrived there.

402
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:38,715
They say that he murdered the
company of the San Cristobal,

403
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,864
it enslaved those
native of this island...

404
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:43,050
and it killed to all those that
they came from then on.

405
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:48,739
- Some say that him still bush.
- Excuse to have asked.

406
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:52,329
For me, it is only
pirates' history...

407
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:55,206
and smugglers
to move away people.

408
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:58,699
- Do you understand of the matter, truth?
- That can say?

409
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,927
They have made
a good work, truth?

410
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,594
that that was?

411
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,463
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither me.

412
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:29,567
Greg, run. Run!

413
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,210
Greg?

414
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,425
We cannot stay here,
we are very vulnerable.

415
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:50,652
I already know, but not
we can leave of here...

416
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:51,746
while Casper
and Greg doesn't return.

417
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:53,199
We have to return
to the ship, but me,

418
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:54,581
I don't enter to the water of
any way.

419
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,623
No, it is very far and also
we don't know who is on board.

420
00:47:58,702 --> 00:48:00,210
And that house?

421
00:48:02,106 --> 00:48:03,610
It is good to defend,
we will have refuge.

422
00:48:04,025 --> 00:48:05,172
Ok, is a good idea.

423
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,965
- We go there they hardly return.
- And if they don't return?

424
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,114
- They will return.
- And if they don't return that make?

425
00:48:12,608 --> 00:48:15,304
We don't have weapons, food,
we don't have a shit.

426
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:16,849
I know that we will make.

427
00:48:29,498 --> 00:48:30,300
You should
to be joking.

428
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:33,699
Is Casper for that reason after his?
Does it smuggle pure Cubans?

429
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:35,226
And some other things.

430
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,788
I see that you are still
in the smuggling, Viktor.

431
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,867
You would Like to be able to
to prove that, truth Jordan?

432
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:41,934
And that this is?

433
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:45,039
- Then, we already have it.
- Clear.

434
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:45,817
That madness, not?

435
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,788
We have problems
but big,

436
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:51,210
my ship was destroyed
and my assistant disappeared.

437
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,893
And Greg, Casper, where it is?

438
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:56,264
I believe that it didn't get it.

439
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:57,976
That he means with
"Do I believe that it didn't get it?"

440
00:48:58,277 --> 00:49:01,746
- He left. I Sit down it a lot.
- We have go to look for it!

441
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,699
It can be that him this well,
and we cannot abandon him there.

442
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,623
it is dead.

443
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,619
And you will end up as him if not
you are quiet the mouth and you listen to it.

444
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,952
That you have there besides pure?
Some useful thing?

445
00:49:16,492 --> 00:49:19,181
I will present them
to my small friend.

446
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,565
Who said that the size
doesn't it care?

447
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,652
Very Well!. For my
the biggest.

448
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:37,228
Gauge big.
Take the shotgun,

449
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:39,103
with this you can have
some opportunity.

450
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:42,210
I left the better couple the last one.

451
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:46,918
Here it is. Take!

452
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,438
Good election. Desert Eagle.

453
00:49:55,277 --> 00:49:56,721
I like like you think, girl.

454
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:01,009
We cannot stay here,
those creatures are everywhere.

455
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:04,099
We planned to go until
the house that we find.

456
00:50:04,291 --> 00:50:06,889
Good idea. We can tolerate
until help arrives.

457
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,385
If the help comes.

458
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,228
Don't worry.
When they don't receive...

459
00:50:10,228 --> 00:50:11,916
our report the marine one
he will come to look for us.

460
00:50:12,231 --> 00:50:13,686
Do all know how to manage their weapons?

461
00:50:56,478 --> 00:50:58,083
- shit!
- We have to enter in the house.

462
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:00,148
And if they are inside?

463
00:51:00,436 --> 00:51:02,007
We will have to take the house,

464
00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:03,579
and we will defend better there
inside of that here out.

465
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,954
My God!

466
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,844
Here, all.

467
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,114
To the house!

468
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:50,735
- Trancada is.
- Let us give the turn.

469
00:56:51,047 --> 00:56:52,123
Explode the door.

470
00:56:52,422 --> 00:56:54,601
It economizes bullets, it is
better to use them with them.

471
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,844
Forget it, we go to
to find another entrance.

472
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:05,371
Care, grenade.

473
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:24,693
You shoot well.

474
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,619
My God!

475
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:42,630
Rudy!

476
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,380
No!

477
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:24,463
McGyvers.

478
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:49,489
- I need more ammunition.
- I don't have none.

479
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:51,583
- I am with my last loader.
- Me also.

480
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,275
- Me also.
- I keep the last one for my.

481
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:55,757
Are you well?

482
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,556
Let us go!

483
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:07,181
- The window.
- Can you go by her?

484
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:09,759
Yes, we go.

485
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,367
Die, the prostitute's son!

486
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:24,925
No! Quick!

487
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:41,827
Oh, my God!

488
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,119
My God!

489
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:51,463
Casper, looks at me.
You look at me.

490
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:54,858
I need you to look at me.
Ok? You look at me.

491
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:58,351
You look at me. Did you save me, ok?

492
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:01,045
You saved us.

493
01:00:06,942 --> 01:00:07,969
shit, I am without ammunition

494
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,445
We are walled!

495
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:01,920
We will put it in the table.

496
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,670
I will look for something
to be treated.

497
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,804
Simon, looks at the other ones.

498
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,856
- I Sit down it a lot.
- Where this Casper?

499
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,672
She could not arrive.
I sit down it a lot.

500
01:01:27,085 --> 01:01:27,585
This All well.

501
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,666
Captain, it will hurt.

502
01:01:39,264 --> 01:01:41,672
We go, make it. Make it.

503
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,081
- Is it prepared?
- Yes.

504
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:51,552
Give me my lighter. Here.

505
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:57,634
Curse.

506
01:01:58,313 --> 01:02:00,181
- shit.
- Simon?

507
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,822
- Simon?
- Don't look at me.

508
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:13,858
I seem a monster.

509
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:23,599
- Simon, allow me to look...
- Salt of here. I don't need your help.

510
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,255
- Like it is, Kirk?
- Well. Well

511
01:02:42,146 --> 01:02:44,199
Rest a little.

512
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,864
- Do you have some idea?
- I don't know it.

513
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:12,527
That he will spend?

514
01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:14,311
It doesn't care.

515
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:16,621
For me it cares!

516
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:21,231
Won't we be able to leave of here?

517
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:23,621
Still leaving of here, I am completed.

518
01:03:24,277 --> 01:03:26,952
Who will want to look
a face like east?

519
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:31,617
- I am a circus aberration.
- Don't speak this way.

520
01:03:32,027 --> 01:03:34,313
I believe that you were very valiant today.

521
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:37,469
And I believe that even
you are very sexy.

522
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,179
You don't make it so that
did it feel better, certain?

523
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:51,938
I am making this for
to feel better me.

524
01:04:04,134 --> 01:04:05,152
It is so calm.

525
01:04:06,657 --> 01:04:08,061
Yes, too calm.

526
01:04:09,056 --> 01:04:09,509
Look at that.

527
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:11,510
What?

528
01:04:12,786 --> 01:04:14,119
Where are dragging them?

529
01:04:16,527 --> 01:04:19,179
- That are making with the bodies?
- I have a bad presentimento.

530
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:27,489
That it happened?

531
01:04:29,527 --> 01:04:31,739
- Rudy That I happen?
- That it cares?

532
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:34,592
She is dead. I didn't save her.

533
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,940
- It was not your blame.
- The blame was mine!

534
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,342
It was my blame!

535
01:04:40,413 --> 01:04:42,534
Were you here?
Did you dress him?

536
01:04:43,106 --> 01:04:45,184
You dressed when she was
being quartered?

537
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:10,896
It won't happen again.

538
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:13,835
We will leave of here.

539
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,992
Hey, is Kirk. It is better to look at it,
it is worsening.

540
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:38,543
As it is, captain?

541
01:05:40,005 --> 01:05:41,233
I would like a swig.

542
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:49,255
It is all that we have.

543
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:53,431
It is not what I had in mind,
but thank you equally

544
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:00,672
We will give one
look to this book.

545
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:04,989
It is very old,
perhaps he helps us.

546
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:13,485
Well, tell me the truth.
Will I improve or not?

547
01:06:16,523 --> 01:06:17,652
We are in a crisis.

548
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,233
There is not " water " and still
they are many of them.

549
01:06:21,235 --> 01:06:24,389
Perhaps be better to leave
of making of babysitter

550
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:27,318
and to begin to worry
for you.

551
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:28,983
That he has in mind?

552
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:32,443
Look in the rest of the house,
look that they can use

553
01:06:32,445 --> 01:06:35,036
to be protected better.

554
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:38,902
It is not necessary as knowing if it is that even
they won't try to enter here.

555
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:43,259
Perhaps have not left of here.

556
01:06:44,398 --> 01:06:46,590
Boys, it seems that
a ship robbed here.

557
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:50,101
The newspaper of I approach
he says that Castillo Sermano

558
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:53,119
the captain killed, it beached
the ship and it set on fire it.

559
01:06:53,858 --> 01:06:56,003
The history that Kirk counted
he has felt now.

560
01:06:56,605 --> 01:06:58,661
Better you go now.
Go!

561
01:07:00,135 --> 01:07:00,675
Of agreement.

562
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:04,402
Will it be well?

563
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,945
If. But, I can
to have this.

564
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:13,775
The captain is right,
we have to leave of here

565
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:15,114
and to watch over the rest
of the house.

566
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:22,724
We go.

567
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:31,974
We will begin
over there behind.

568
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,054
That all this is?

569
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,184
There is there inside something.

570
01:07:54,393 --> 01:07:56,797
- Rudy. I cannot open it.
- Is trancada?

571
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:57,391
Yes.

572
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:09,190
Who was here? God.

573
01:08:11,474 --> 01:08:12,795
This is disgusting.

574
01:08:21,627 --> 01:08:22,327
Alicia?

575
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,913
It excuses.

576
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:26,828
This is incredible.

577
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:31,125
- Why don't they live as the other ones?
- I don't know it.

578
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,755
Rudy, looks at this.

579
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,822
- It is blood.
- Do bleed?

580
01:09:20,306 --> 01:09:20,988
If, but...

581
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:24,082
It is not human.

582
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:27,140
It seems that it suffered a mutation.

583
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:30,448
I never saw he swims this way.

584
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,886
totally supernatural

585
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,603
It is brilliant.

586
01:09:52,787 --> 01:09:53,712
Salish?

587
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,188
Salish?

588
01:10:35,251 --> 01:10:35,916
Salish?

589
01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:51,596
Salish?

590
01:10:58,613 --> 01:10:59,136
Kirk!

591
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:05,051
Salish, I believed that
you belonged one to them.

592
01:11:08,944 --> 01:11:10,859
Kirk, where it is?

593
01:11:25,286 --> 01:11:25,850
Kirk.

594
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:28,431
That you are making?

595
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,211
- They will kill him.
- I am already dead.

596
01:11:41,484 --> 01:11:42,962
I see them in the hell,
boys.

597
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:45,077
Bend over!

598
01:11:54,956 --> 01:11:56,426
Leave all of here!

599
01:11:59,033 --> 01:12:01,282
They are arriving.
Block the door.

600
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,082
We go. Quickly. Quickly.

601
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:05,828
Rudy?

602
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:08,219
That?

603
01:12:12,466 --> 01:12:14,203
- That that is?
- Prostitute's son.

604
01:12:15,559 --> 01:12:18,729
- It is gunpowder.
- That good, can we use it, not?

605
01:12:19,555 --> 01:12:24,676
We can only make it explode.
It is useless, somebody would have to be here.

606
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:28,631
- I go to the lab to see if I find something.
- Ok, I go with you.

607
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:31,970
We will see

608
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:38,194
That that is?

609
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,711
That this happening?

610
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:49,975
Karma, not!

611
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:54,493
Oh, my God! It is blood!

612
01:12:55,474 --> 01:12:56,220
It revives them.

613
01:13:02,662 --> 01:13:03,890
Rudy, we go

614
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,029
Here. Here.

615
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,444
He takes, it uses this

616
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:13,091
Help me with this.

617
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:17,765
Salt of the front.

618
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:25,447
- Simon!
- Hear, I found a door!

619
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,002
Enter. Let us go!

620
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:29,166
- Simon, let us go!
- Ok.

621
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:31,805
Simon!

622
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:36,413
Veto!

623
01:13:39,845 --> 01:13:40,345
shit!

624
01:14:33,661 --> 01:14:34,564
Where devils are?

625
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:37,779
It should be kind of a
catacomb, under the house.

626
01:14:38,922 --> 01:14:39,613
Simon?

627
01:14:40,622 --> 01:14:41,395
I sit down it, Karma.

628
01:14:44,082 --> 01:14:47,194
It should be as well as they were
of the house until the ship.

629
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:50,305
Some tunnel should
to give to the beach.

630
01:14:52,466 --> 01:14:53,018
We go.

631
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:14,680
Finish my ammunition.

632
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,962
- Did they finish?
- I wait that yes.

633
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:37,154
Still.

634
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:54,466
Let us go! Let us go!
Let us go!

635
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,500
I am in charge of of them.

636
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,694
Karma, not!

637
01:16:12,198 --> 01:16:14,439
Salt of there, quickly!
Quickly!

638
01:16:29,614 --> 01:16:30,270
Greg?

639
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,207
- Greg That you are making here?
- That salts this it is?

640
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,184
Greg, we thought
that you were dead.

641
01:17:17,114 --> 01:17:18,295
Greg, I gave something.

642
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:28,573
Alicia, move away from him. It is not Greg,
stay far from him!

643
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:31,782
Come unfastened.

644
01:17:32,466 --> 01:17:33,679
That he wants with us?

645
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:40,881
Bring it. Place it here.

646
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,462
The parts of your body.
They go to be useful for a lot of time.

647
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:02,131
Your you gave life to all
those creatures, why?

648
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:05,430
To live eternally

649
01:18:06,511 --> 01:18:07,167
It is certain.

650
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:11,024
After every year,
finally it is certain.

651
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,733
The blood. It is alive.

652
01:18:15,305 --> 01:18:18,649
Fantastic.
Do I listen what I said?

653
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:20,658
It works.

654
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:23,282
I will live forever.

655
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,185
Forever.

656
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:35,898
I will never die.

657
01:18:37,372 --> 01:18:38,742
They believe that they can
to kill me, but.

658
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:41,877
I will live forever.

659
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,707
Forever!

660
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,617
Your skin is so beautiful.

661
01:19:18,127 --> 01:19:19,729
He was waiting for tí.

662
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:21,926
For a lot of time.

663
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:25,796
That he wants?

664
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:30,170
I only want your meat.

665
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,094
Greg!

666
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:50,287
Come!

667
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:52,760
Let us go!

668
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,444
- Devils, that was close.
- I cannot believe what happened.

669
01:20:20,501 --> 01:20:23,551
- It is good to know that somebody
does he want your body, not?

670
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:25,658
Si.Pero wants
to keep this.

671
01:20:32,587 --> 01:20:33,729
We have to arrive
to the beach, we go.

672
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:40,212
Rudy!

673
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:11,738
Curse.

674
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:19,000
Damned!

675
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:45,774
Game over, unfortunate.

676
01:22:57,421 --> 01:22:58,002
Oh, my God!

677
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:12,292
Protect the area,
we will enter.

678
01:24:12,295 --> 01:24:15,421
If something that is not human, come
enter in alert alpha.

679
01:24:19,952 --> 01:24:20,466
Who you are?

680
01:24:21,537 --> 01:24:22,118
Who you are?

681
01:24:22,984 --> 01:24:24,002
We came to rescue them.

682
01:24:26,412 --> 01:24:27,220
Thank you.

683
01:24:28,341 --> 01:24:29,091
Is she well?

684
01:24:29,747 --> 01:24:30,627
Does she seem well?

685
01:24:36,685 --> 01:24:37,377
Which their name is?

686
01:24:39,787 --> 01:24:42,479
- Rudolph.
- Does he have last name?

687
01:24:45,756 --> 01:24:46,426
Curien.

688
01:24:48,782 --> 01:24:52,095
I feel guilty
for what I happen.

689
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,032
It was a nightmare.

690
01:24:54,938 --> 01:24:57,801
So many deads.
So many victims.

691
01:24:58,309 --> 01:24:59,720
People that were
my friends.

692
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:03,515
And now we go home.
Me and Alicia.

693
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,783
Or what she is now.
Something that I have created.

694
01:25:07,864 --> 01:25:09,431
God, the love is not
a misfortune?

695
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:11,703
Will the end be?

696
01:25:12,612 --> 01:25:13,560
Or the beginning?

697
01:25:15,612 --> 01:26:13,560
