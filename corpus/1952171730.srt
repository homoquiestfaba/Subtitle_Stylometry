00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,350
- Nick
- D.A.

3
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,543
What's going on out here?

4
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:37,429
Well, anonymous 9-1-1 caller reported
body parts in this area.

5
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:38,924
I rolled...

6
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:40,519
And found this.

7
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,507
Hmm, Tasty.

8
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:02,253
Any idea how long it's going to take you
to get this stuff out of here?

9
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:05,044
- Well...
I can't move the, uh...

10
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:07,836
The "body" until the coroner releases the scene.

11
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:10,129
It's a busy night. It's probably gonna take a while, man.

12
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,525
Great.

13
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:14,515
Hey, you mind if I step away for a second?

14
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,606
I need to get some fresher air.

15
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:20,198
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
take your time.

16
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:37,844
Hey, you, uh...

17
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,041
Want some gum?

18
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,636
No, thank you.

19
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,033
That's peculiar.

20
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,186
Think!

21
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:36,981
Did you see anybody else
in the area?

22
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:39,972
I didn't see anything, sir.

23
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,863
I mean, I only took my eyes off him for a couple seconds...

24
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:45,954
You're not supposed to take your eyes off him ever.

25
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,044
He's been gone maybe 25 minutes.

26
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:43,079
I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.

27
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,354
Smells like alcohol.

28
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:29,338
- Why'd you bag that?
- I didn't.

29
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:33,127
It's the wrong color tape.

30
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,420
No initials on the seal.

31
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,912
That's not Nick's evidence.

32
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:39,806
Maybe it's a message.

33
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:23,091
Two heads are better than one.

34
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:26,581
Spatter patterns are a match.
One bullet, two victims.

35
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,475
No, no, no, no.
Grissom, that isn't possible.

36
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,961
I sampled every square inch of that scene,
and there was only one DNA type on the bloodstains.

37
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,058
How 'bout that?

38
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,049
Our mystery vics are identical twins.

39
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:38,544
Twins?

40
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:44,426
- Well, that's different.
- Technically, it's the same.

41
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,012
What's this?

42
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:53,199
- I just got it.
It's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger,

43
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:57,586
"The Smartest Horse in the Movies,"
issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America.

44
00:08:57,686 --> 00:09:00,677
Roy felt that the children of America
were the true owners of Trigger,

45
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:03,069
so any kid that would write him,
he'd send 'em one of those.

46
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,964
And where did you get it?

47
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:06,858
The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum

48
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:10,247
Which used to be in Victorville, California,
and is now in Branson, Missouri.

49
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:15,830
- Roy Rogers, the cowboy?
- King of the cowboys.

50
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,024
I wrote to him when I was four.
He sent me one of those.

51
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,416
I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.

52
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:23,507
And then you thought you would frame it.

53
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:24,604
Yeah.

54
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:32,480
The object of the game is to be the first one to make it to
Uncle Jesse's farm without running into Roscoe.

55
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,670
Now, there's 2 ways to do that.
You can either take the dirt road or the highway.

56
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,162
Dirt road is slower because you can
only roll with one dice,

57
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:43,147
But it's safe because you don't run into any of the Hazzard
cards that you would find on the highway, right?

58
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:46,238
But when you are on the highway, you get to roll two dice,
which makes you go faster.

59
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,229
I'm gonna pretend take the highway,
so I'm gonna move General Lee eight spaces.

60
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,322
One, two, three, four, five... eight.

61
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:54,114
I hit a Hazzard card.
Now, Hazzard cards you don't want.

62
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:57,802
"Cooter splashes mud on your windshield. "
You lose one turn, all right?

63
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,192
- Think you got it?
- I think I got it.

64
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,488
Cool.

65
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:04,881
All right, well,
I've never been one to take the path of least resistance

66
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,772
So I'm going for the dirt road.
One dice.

67
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,962
You know, far be it from me to wax nostalgic, but, uh,

68
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:12,557
I kind of miss the old Greg.

69
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:16,645
Ugly t-shirts, goofy hair, semi-pornographic magazines...

70
00:10:16,745 --> 00:10:19,137
Yeah, well, at least I had a style to change.

71
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:24,521
Four.
One, two, three, four.

72
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:26,315
"Take a Duke card. "
What's a Duke card?

73
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:27,911
Duke cards are good. You want one of those 'cause,

74
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,104
It gets you through the dirt road a lot faster.

75
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:32,197
- Okay, so Duke cards, good;
Hazzard cards, bad.

76
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,394
Correct.

77
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,980
- "You jumped over a pile of rocks. Move
five extra spaces. "

78
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,276
- Nice.
- Yeah-hoo.

79
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,971
Oh, and by the way, uh...

80
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,064
This is just the work me.

81
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,656
You haven't had the full David Hodges experience.

82
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:47,750
I think I'm having it right now.

83
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,342
Aw, come on,
you can't unfund me now.

84
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,140
I...

85
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,233
I'm committed to presenting the paper
at SWAFS next month.

86
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,025
If it means that much to you, pay your own way.

87
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:58,418
Show a little dedication to your discipline.

88
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:03,303
Oh, yeah. Tragically, my banking account
isn't as dedicated as I am.

89
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,097
One word: Plastic.

90
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,393
Wait.

91
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,487
How 'bout you kick me a little overtime
under the table, huh?

92
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:11,677
- Over my dead body.
Have you been to Grissom's office?

93
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:15,665
You think the City of Las Vegas pays
for his etymology library,

94
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,656
His insect collection, his shrunken head collection?

95
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:19,553
No.

96
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,544
Take initiative. People notice.

97
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:30,021
...So I took my girl to that
Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.

98
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,214
Oh, yeah, yeah, down over at the, uh, Spur?

99
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:35,305
- Yeah.
Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.

100
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,501
No way.

101
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:38,296
You almost got into a beef?

102
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,290
You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun.

103
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:42,682
I play down the fact that I'm a cop
when I'm with her anyway.

104
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:44,577
Yeah, yeah, you play the scientist card.

105
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:46,571
You're a "copologist. "

106
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,362
So, uh,

107
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,148
We're standing out in front of the hotel,
making out and this guy walks up to me,

108
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,842
Gets in my face,

109
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:58,036
And asks me how she is.

110
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,030
No, he didn't.

111
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,425
So?

112
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:04,017
I tell him to get lost. He says,
"Make me. "

113
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,806
So I took a step forward and out of nowhere
his big, fat bodyguard,

114
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:10,498
Looking like Wimpy from Popeye,

115
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,987
Walks up and starts to close in on me.

116
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:18,772
This fat boy is looking like he's obviously
carrying some sort of weapon.

117
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,365
And I'm standing there naked as a
porn star with my girl.

118
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,960
Did you tell them you're a "cop"?

119
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,452
They didn't seem to care.
One of the guys sounded Russian,

120
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:29,739
Like he was wanna-be Mafia.
Fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.

121
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:31,833
So, uh,

122
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:37,914
You know, I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but
something was kind of sinister about them.

123
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:39,709
They were provoking me,

124
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,403
But they weren't making a move.

125
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,497
It was almost like they were waiting
for me to make a move.

126
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,391
Say if I smacked big-mouth,

127
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,784
Fat boy would've came over and
stabbed me or something.

128
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:51,473
Even fat boy was vibing me
not to take the bait.

129
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:52,569
So what happened?

130
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:54,663
Well, valet finally brought Tina's car up.

131
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:57,155
So, I maneuver her around these guys

132
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:01,043
And I put her in her car, and
I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack.

133
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:03,735
I'm calming Tina down. Tell her everything is fine.

134
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:06,826
She drives off and I walk away.

135
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,820
I called Tina later on...

136
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,309
And I tell her, uh, you know,
if she got any problem with me being a cop,

137
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,403
She needs to get over it, 'cause now I'm packing.

138
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,593
Yeah. Yeah.
What'd you do on Sunday?

139
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,986
Scoured the hotel looking for these punks.

140
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,372
Oh, my two favorite guys.

141
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:29,257
So, I've got an assault at Stripperama
and a trash run at Flamingo and Koval.

142
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,949
I'm too busy to play favorites,
so duke it out.

143
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,345
Duke it out.

144
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,535
Boy! Better flip a coin.
I'll hurt you.

145
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:38,130
Yeah, you better flip that coin.

146
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,523
- Call it in the air.
- Heads.

147
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:44,511
Have fun at the trash run.

148
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,299
You know, I'd do two out of three,
but you got a gambling problem.

149
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:51,689
No, hey, you know what?
You keep this.

150
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,583
It's bad luck.

151
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:51,108
Dumpster's clean.

152
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:53,899
No apparent blood or body parts.

153
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,295
Take a look at this.

154
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:57,887
This seems contrived to me.

155
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:00,778
The blood pool is too perfect.
There's no splatter.

156
00:15:00,878 --> 00:15:03,071
Like somebody placed these entrails.

157
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:06,860
A lure.

158
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,355
To grab Nick.

159
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,648
David...

160
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:12,243
Get this stuff to the doc.
- Look I'm...

161
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,237
I'm really sorry
I didn't get here sooner.

162
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:15,633
Maybe if I had...

163
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,228
We're going to get him back, David.

164
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:18,823
Gil, Catherine.

165
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:20,817
I want you to know, as far as I'm concerned,

166
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,612
Llab's only got one case tonight.

167
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,107
Same for the rest of the department.

168
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,702
Thanks, Conrad.

169
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:29,989
Hey.

170
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,880
What do you need me to do?

171
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:54,913
They've lost the scent.

172
00:15:55,212 --> 00:15:57,007
Might be as far as it goes.

173
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:00,795
Yeah, there was some sort of large vehicle here.

174
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:42,269
Well, there are a lot of intestines here,
but no appendix,

175
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,661
Which made sense when I saw this.

176
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:45,957
A cecum.

177
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:48,250
- Dog entrails.
- Yeah.

178
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,743
That's not going to help.

179
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,139
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,435
Catherine...

181
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,924
Has Nick's family been informed?

182
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:00,513
No, that would be my job.

183
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:09,885
I swabbed the seal for epithelials,
but there were no prints on the outside of the bag.

184
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,181
What about Nick's camera?

185
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,872
No fingerprints.
There were some photographs, mostly generals.

186
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:18,558
There were a few detail shots of entrails and trash.
But no lucky grabs of anybody else at the scene.

187
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:21,848
I don't think we're gonna get lucky with this guy.
He knows how to work clean.

188
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,839
Grissom,
I pulled all of Nick's active and recent cases.

189
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:27,132
I want to know anyone who had a grudge against him.

190
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:29,824
Civilian complaints, death threats...
- Got It.

191
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,117
There was a guy a couple of years ago that stalked him.

192
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:33,413
- He may be back.
- I remember.

193
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,808
Top of the pile.

194
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:40,391
I'm using your track and wheelbase
measurements plus or minus 5%

195
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,981
To account for rain-shadowing and/or drying effects.

196
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,270
All right, print it out.

197
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,795
I need you to bring up the traffic cameras
in a 3-block radius,

198
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,847
Between Flamingo and
Koval in the last 24 hours.

199
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:59,633
We only buffer the video for the past few hours.
I can take you back as far as 10:37 P.M.

200
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,222
That's good enough.
Our guy was taken around 11:00.

201
00:18:06,113 --> 00:18:08,805
Scan forward. We're looking for a big truck.

202
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:17,379
How about that one? Looks like a Suburban.

203
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,463
It's on the list.

204
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:26,252
Whoa, he's really moving.

205
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:29,242
Wait a minute. That one, the big Ford.

206
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:32,832
Follow it.

207
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:24,275
The Expedition truck left the area around 11:15.

208
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:27,664
Definitely in a hurry.
Took a right off Koval onto Tropicana,

209
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:31,852
Crossed Las Vegas Boulevard onto 215 east.
And then it drove off the grid.

210
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,247
At least we have a general direction.

211
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:37,036
Great, so Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley
to Seven Hills to Arizona.

212
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,631
Assuming he was in that truck.

213
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,622
Well, according to Hodges,
the white fibers on Nick's vest

214
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,413
Were cotton with traces of ether...

215
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:51,691
- Ether?
- Yeah.

216
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,887
That's old school.

217
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:55,081
Yeah, stuff is volatile.

218
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,177
Flammable.

219
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,371
Outside of meth cooks, no one uses it anymore.

220
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,966
People use what they know.

221
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,754
All right, so, where are we on possible suspects?

222
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:07,244
So far, none of Nick's active or recent cases stands out.

223
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,938
And his old stalker's still bend bars.

224
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,328
Maybe it's a random act.

225
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,217
Well, that's possible.
Because whoever staged the crime scene,

226
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,718
Couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.

227
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,911
Yeah, it was just bad luck he did.

228
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,703
Sara, what about the coffee cup?

229
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,095
No DNA or prints on the cup or in the bag.

230
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:25,089
Don't touch the edge of it!
You got to sign...

231
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,385
Security! Security!

232
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:29,476
Get your freakin' hands off me, man!

233
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,171
Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.

234
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,865
Hey, I told you, you got to sign for that!

235
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,660
What are you doing, Hodges?

236
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,152
- Guy comes in here with a package
with no return address.

237
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:38,847
You're violating my rights! I want a lawyer!

238
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,044
Shut up.

239
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,357
Way the guy was pawing that envelope,

240
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:45,028
I figure I better get it away from
him before he wipes off all the trace.

241
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:46,623
What trace?

242
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:48,717
It's about Nick.

243
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,158
Let me do this.

244
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,948
Hi, CSI guy.

245
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,740
You wondering why you're here?

246
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:34,229
Because you followed the evidence.

247
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:37,818
Because that's what CSI's do.

248
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:41,407
So breathe quick, breathe slow,

249
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:45,395
Put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.

250
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:49,582
Any way you like,
you're going to die here.

251
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,174
Okay?

252
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:01,663
Son of a bitch.
He's screwing with us.

253
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,244
I don't think he knows we can see him.

254
00:27:46,343 --> 00:27:48,736
How can we be sure it's a live feed?

255
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,231
We've got to assume that it is.

256
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:52,624
The space in that box,

257
00:27:52,724 --> 00:27:54,120
Looks like 2x2x6,

258
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:56,512
Which would be 24 cubic feet.

259
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,902
That would hold approximately 600 liters of air.

260
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,992
If you figure half a liter per breath,

261
00:28:03,092 --> 00:28:04,687
Slow breathing...

262
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:11,168
Maybe 12 breaths per minute.
Panic breathing would be, what, twice that much.

263
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:14,258
Well, if the math is right,

264
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,950
He's got about an hour and 15 minutes
of air left in that box.

265
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,143
But if they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours,

266
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:22,334
It must mean that he's got an additional air supply.

267
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,783
We lost the feed.

268
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:48,254
Looks like a live feed to me.

269
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:51,146
I say we keep the light on.

270
00:28:53,937 --> 00:28:57,227
I'm gonna get right to it,
because time is of the essence here.

271
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:58,723
Where'd you get that package, bud?

272
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,016
I'd like to advise my client.

273
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,209
Careful how you answer that, son.

274
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,698
This man here's slicker than a snake in the
curly green grass.

275
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,888
He's right, so you better be careful.

276
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:12,780
I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle.

277
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:15,870
When I got there, I didn't talk to an actual person.

278
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,263
I just found an abandoned package with
some cash taped to it.

279
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:20,456
- How much cash?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

280
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:23,248
That's confidential business 'tween me
and this here buckaroo.

281
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:26,637
Easy, boots.
I'm gonna need those bills.

282
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,124
It was a 100 bucks.
If you want it back, you're gonna have to ask Steve Wynn.

283
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:32,420
What's the address?

284
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:44,184
Code four. Code four.

285
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,664
Yeah, the address was a waste of time.

286
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:52,658
Nothing here but a fat drunk and a bad smell.

287
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,649
The guy probably picked the house at random,
'cause he knew we'd chase it.

288
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:59,238
- Any news on the web cam location?
- Archie's trying to narrow it down.

289
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,528
The feed stays active for two minutes every time
you press the "WATCH" button.

290
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,522
But I got to go. I got people to see.

291
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:06,915
Everybody, I have some bad news.

292
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:11,800
Uh, a little while ago, I spoke with the mayor directly.

293
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:16,087
The City of Las Vegas is not going to finance a ransom.

294
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:19,775
It's-it's against department policy to
negotiate with terrorists.

295
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,470
No exceptions.

296
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:25,458
Judge Stokes, Mrs. Stokes,

297
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:26,953
Gil Grissom.

298
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:30,742
Your honor. Mrs. Stokes. I'm, uh...

299
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,935
Sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.

300
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:36,425
Have you been able to make contact with the
animals who took my son?

301
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:39,017
No, we haven't yet, but...

302
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:42,107
They should be contacting us in roughly four hours.

303
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,198
We were able to rustle up $20,000 cash.

304
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:47,790
Our bank's prepared to wire another $100,000.

305
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,083
Now, we can sell the cars.
We can hock the ranch...

306
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:52,376
We can make the number.

307
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,469
But it's gonna take at least another day.

308
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,965
Judge Stokes...

309
00:30:56,065 --> 00:30:58,557
Can we give them... the money we have now,
try to buy more time?

310
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,744
I don't think that will help.

311
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,134
There's got to be something we can do.

312
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:09,324
You've already done it by coming here,
by showing your support...

313
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:12,714
We're not here to show support.
We're here to get Nick home.

314
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:19,493
We're not sure who has your son...

315
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:21,288
Or why.

316
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:23,880
Well...

317
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:26,871
What the hell do you know?

318
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,064
Very little.

319
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,058
Let's just cut to the gist.

320
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:35,046
What proof do you have that my boy's still alive?

321
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:08,942
No...

322
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,002
Pancho...

323
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:25,292
What the hell you got yourself into?

324
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:19,926
You should have seen this town in the early '70s.

325
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,917
- Gamblers were kings.
- Yeah, not the same anymore.

326
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:25,608
Showgirls were showgirls.

327
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,902
Everybody knew your name in those days

328
00:33:28,001 --> 00:33:29,796
You could dress up in drag, huh?

329
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:33,285
- Me, dress up in drag?
Who do you think you're talking to?

330
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:34,581
Jack Lemmon?

331
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:36,874
That's good.

332
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:39,067
Anyway, we had a good time in those days,
you know?

333
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:43,155
You could walk down the streets in this
town 15, 20 years ago,

334
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:47,243
With 50,000 bucks stacked on the top
of your head in singles,

335
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:51,031
And nobody would bother you.
Except this guy.

336
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:52,825
He would bother you.

337
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,118
It's either your money or it's my money.

338
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:56,415
Hey, w-w-w-w-w-w...

339
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,904
I gave you that line.
It's bad enough you're on top of that casino saying,

340
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,898
"Come into my place. "

341
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,689
That's the other guy
- The richer one.

342
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:05,985
- Take it easy.
- Easy?

343
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,176
What do you mean easy?
You talking about yourself? Or her?

344
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:12,366
I'll tell you, if she's easy,
I've got my whole day planned.

345
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:14,559
You ought to come and see my show, Tony.

346
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,055
I invited Jack Nicholson; he said,

347
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,245
"I'd rather stick needles in my eyes. "

348
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:22,036
What do you think of that?

349
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:27,619
- Weren't we in the Vikings together?
- Oh, I remember it well, Tony.

350
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,311
That's the best Burt Lancaster I ever heard.

351
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,701
Sam?

352
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:38,287
Oh, miss, I like my coffee with cream and sugar,

353
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:42,374
And I want you to give the r-r-really big check
to really big Sam over here.

354
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:47,459
- Sam, I need to talk to you
- He's already got someone to talk to, ma'am.

355
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,652
Zip it, sweetheart.

356
00:34:49,752 --> 00:34:50,649
Sam...

357
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:53,640
Everyone, I'd like for you to meet
my daughter, Catherine.

358
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,232
Well, you can cancel the coffee.

359
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:58,824
- Excuse us for a minute, all right?
- Certainly.

360
00:34:58,924 --> 00:35:01,416
One of my guys is in trouble. He's been kidnapped.

361
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,709
I need a million dollars in cash.

362
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,703
Large bills.

363
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,999
And I need it now.

364
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:09,093
Let me guess, Mugs.

365
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,785
The department won't pay the ransom.

366
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,779
No.

367
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,274
Why should I?

368
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:21,754
Considering the problems that you've
had with the law,

369
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,549
you could use some good publicity.

370
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:26,340
Do I look like a man that needs publicity?

371
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:31,026
If you're coming to me like a cop
with a tin cup in your hand,

372
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:33,219
The answer is no.

373
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:36,709
I'm not here as a cop.

374
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:42,890
Then ask me like you were my daughter.

375
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,361
I got the money.

376
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:54,953
From where?

377
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:57,047
Where do you think?

378
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:08,910
Catherine, if the press finds out about this,
it'll look like,

379
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,605
Sam Braun bribed the lab.

380
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:12,898
He's a casino owner. A leader of industry.

381
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,493
Never convicted of any crime.

382
00:36:14,593 --> 00:36:17,883
And right now, I don't care about the integrity
of the lab at the moment. I care about Nick.

383
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,777
Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless...

384
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,170
Well, you're sitting here like Jack Handy with your
deep thoughts, staring at a coffee cup.

385
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:24,463
You got a better plan, I'm all ears.

386
00:36:29,348 --> 00:36:30,744
All right.

387
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:33,535
But I make the drop. You're hands off.

388
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,327
- That's my money.
- You can't be seen anywhere near this money.

389
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:38,919
It was given to the lab anonymously.

390
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,315
Agreed?

391
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:43,505
Agreed.

392
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,739
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

393
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,434
Through the door.

394
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:28,186
Pretty quiet outside.

395
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:32,173
Almost sounds like you came alone.

396
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:35,264
I've got your money.

397
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:39,551
Put it down.

398
00:38:48,723 --> 00:38:50,418
Slide it over.

399
00:39:04,973 --> 00:39:07,466
You're telling me there's a million dollars in here.

400
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:08,463
Yes.

401
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:11,653
Along with some cute little booby traps?

402
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:15,142
Which is it, a tracer, a dye pack?

403
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:19,130
Normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time,
you're 100% wrong.

404
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,822
We want Nick back, no tricks.

405
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:46,148
- This looks real.
- It is real.

406
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,640
Where is Nick?

407
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:57,114
You know, I was under the impression it was
against departmental policy,

408
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:59,906
to negotiate with terrorists.

409
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:01,800
Are you a terrorist?

410
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,296
Depends.

411
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:07,283
Are you terrified?

412
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,667
- Look, I really don't want to talk to you.
Where is my guy?

413
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:13,963
Oh, so...

414
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:16,655
- He is 'your guy', huh?
- Yes, he is.

415
00:40:16,754 --> 00:40:20,344
- Where is he buried?
- Are you two close?

416
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,235
That's none of your business.

417
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,627
What does Nick Stokes mean to you?

418
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:28,818
How do you feel when you see him...

419
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,712
In that coffin?

420
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,999
Does your soul die every time you push that button?

421
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:41,280
How do you feel, knowing that
there's nothing you can do,

422
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:43,373
To get him out of that hell?

423
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,866
Helpless?

424
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:48,557
Useless?

425
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:51,847
Impotent?

426
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,736
Good.

427
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,029
Welcome...

428
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:00,222
To my world.

429
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,101
Uh, if I were you, I'd back up a little.

430
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:57,282
Pupils are even.

431
00:43:57,382 --> 00:44:02,067
- He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
- Sir, are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?

432
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,354
We got the kidnapper's truck.
Nevada tags: 374-Robert-Charlie-David.

433
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:07,551
Run the plate.

434
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,741
- That's the wrong box, Greg.
- Well, pick one. There's three.

435
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:12,436
That one right there.

436
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,629
Give me a break.
I haven't done this before.

437
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:15,726
All right, let's go over it again.

438
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:21,508
The diagnostic unit gets attachedto that black box,
which gives us the mileage of his last trip.

439
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:22,505
Like an airplane.

440
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:25,496
- That gives us the radius for the search area.
- Right, got it.

441
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:30,979
23 miles. We know he was heading east on the 215.

442
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,175
I'll get a map.

443
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:40,650
Somebody bag this money, please?

444
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:42,643
Don't get any funny ideas, either.

445
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:47,230
What I had to do to get this money and for what.

446
00:44:49,622 --> 00:44:51,018
There's no ID on him.

447
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,842
I got a thumb.

448
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,434
How's he doing?

449
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:55,222
Hard to say.

450
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:56,917
About the same, I guess.

451
00:45:58,014 --> 00:45:59,609
I'm gonna get some coffee.

452
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:00,705
Yeah.

453
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:20,744
Enough...

454
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:23,336
Enough with the damn light!

455
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:53,943
No.

456
00:46:58,031 --> 00:47:00,024
The fan's connected...

457
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:02,517
The fan's connected to the light.

458
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,666
No.

459
00:49:31,163 --> 00:49:32,759
What are you doing, Nicky?

460
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,915
What are you doing, Nicky?

461
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:53,296
Don't do it, Nicky!

462
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,643
You son of a bitch!

463
00:50:33,773 --> 00:50:35,368
You're still alive.

464
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:03,482
- The light and the fan must have been
running off the same battery.

465
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:06,373
Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together.

466
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:10,461
- That's good. What about the web cam trace?
- Signal's running through an anonymizer.

467
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,853
Different ISP each time we click the button.

468
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:15,745
But I think I've got a handle on the pattern.
I'm getting closer.

469
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:23,122
Sara?

470
00:51:23,222 --> 00:51:25,116
I got something off your thumb.

471
00:51:29,203 --> 00:51:31,995
So when you struck out on prints,
I ran DNA through CODIS,

472
00:51:32,095 --> 00:51:35,385
Hoping maybe the guy was in the system off
an open case or a prior felony.

473
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:37,279
I got no straight-up match, but...

474
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:40,469
...but you got a moderate stringency match
for a Kelly Gordon.

475
00:51:40,569 --> 00:51:43,161
Yeah, seven alleles in common, and based on the age,

476
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,457
I'd say it was his daughter.

477
00:51:44,557 --> 00:51:46,052
Good work, Mia.

478
00:51:47,054 --> 00:51:50,538
Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison,

479
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:54,427
Serving year three of a five-year sentence
for accessory to murder.

480
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:05,194
The address of her crime scene
is 625 Viking Circle.

481
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:08,085
That's the same place where the messenger
picked up the package.

482
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,079
It wasn't random.

483
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:21,644
Hey, baby, let's go.

484
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:39,589
Neither was the Styrofoam cup.

485
00:52:40,386 --> 00:52:45,072
So at trial, you testified that you went with
your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his.

486
00:52:45,172 --> 00:52:47,265
And when you went in the house,

487
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,459
Your boyfriend blew the guy away.

488
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:51,353
He wasn't my boyfriend.

489
00:52:51,453 --> 00:52:53,347
I knew the guy two weeks.

490
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:55,839
Why am I here?

491
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,727
A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it
was found in that house.

492
00:52:59,827 --> 00:53:02,918
You claimed you dropped it
running for your life.

493
00:53:09,198 --> 00:53:11,890
My word against a cup,

494
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,476
And the next five years,
I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.

495
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:21,960
You're not reopening my case.

496
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:24,851
What do you want?

497
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,845
Your father took it pretty hard.

498
00:53:26,944 --> 00:53:29,337
He was an aerospace engineer, right?

499
00:53:30,135 --> 00:53:32,228
Good with explosives?

500
00:53:32,328 --> 00:53:34,721
So, this is about my dad?

501
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:39,008
You know, we had your visitor's log.

502
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:43,992
Your father stopped coming to see you
six weeks into your sentence.

503
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,581
Seeing your daughter turned into some...

504
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:51,071
Hood rat's lesbian sex slave can be rather emotional.

505
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:55,457
Why did he come see you last week?

506
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:58,847
Did you know what he was planning to do?

507
00:53:58,947 --> 00:54:00,542
I don't know. What did he do?

508
00:54:00,642 --> 00:54:04,231
- He kidnapped a friend of mine.
A CSI.

509
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,125
And then he blew himself up.

510
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:08,717
Tried to take some cops with him.

511
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:17,191
How many did he get?

512
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:19,584
- Hey, we're all still here.
Nick is still missing.

513
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:22,674
- Who's Nick?
- The CSI is still missing.

514
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:25,266
Do you know where he is?

515
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:30,152
- That's pretty funny, you guys not being able
to find something.

516
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:31,846
Yeah, look,

517
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:35,535
If you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced.

518
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:39,822
You know what I used to do before this?

519
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,012
Back when I was alive?

520
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,302
I used to grow things.

521
00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:47,798
Outside.

522
00:54:49,293 --> 00:54:52,184
I was studying horticulture.

523
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:53,879
Flowers.

524
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:59,662
My cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day.

525
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,151
Want to smell it?

526
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:07,936
I hope your friend dies.

527
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:34,074
Hey, I found a trigger wire,

528
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,071
Maybe...

529
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,962
Once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able
to tell where the bomb came from.

530
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,956
- Maybe that...
- Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

531
00:56:40,055 --> 00:56:44,442
Maybe if we count up all the damn "maybes,"
maybe Nick will be alive!

532
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:47,134
You know what I'm saying?!

533
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:50,523
- Was that necessary? Never mind my clothes.
Look at the evidence.

534
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:51,819
Damn.

535
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:56,306
Sorry, Greg.
I'll go talk to him.

536
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,792
Hey, Warrick, hey.

537
00:57:01,988 --> 00:57:04,082
Hey, how you holding up?

538
00:57:04,182 --> 00:57:05,179
I'm not.

539
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:06,275
I know.

540
00:57:08,269 --> 00:57:11,958
I just can't help thinking that could have
been me in that box, you know?

541
00:57:12,357 --> 00:57:13,952
We flipped a coin for that trash run.

542
00:57:13,953 --> 00:57:16,544
- Hey, Nick is not inside a boxbecause of
the flip of a coin

543
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:20,731
- If that was me, I would have...
- Hey, you know what? I know you.

544
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:22,526
I don't believe that.

545
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,619
Okay?

546
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:25,517
No.

547
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:26,912
You're wrong.

548
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,305
I wouldn't have lasted this far.

549
00:57:30,302 --> 00:57:32,296
Catherine, if something happens to Nick,

550
00:57:32,396 --> 00:57:34,489
If we don't bring him back in one piece...

551
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:36,284
Hey, guys, come here.

552
00:57:36,384 --> 00:57:37,879
I found something.

553
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,166
Look at this.

554
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:51,737
There's something underneath there.

555
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:01,607
- Oh, got an edge right here.
All right.

556
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:04,099
- Another over here.
- Greg, get some crowbars.

557
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:10,779
Do you think Nick could be under here?

558
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:12,274
I don't know, man.

559
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:15,365
It would have to be at least six feet long.

560
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:27,129
Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise,
and who's to say he didn't...

561
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:28,624
He could be.

562
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,729
Hey!

563
00:59:04,914 --> 00:59:06,409
I'm here!

564
00:59:07,406 --> 00:59:08,802
Hey!

565
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,155
I hit something.

566
00:59:42,698 --> 00:59:44,194
It's Plexiglas.

567
00:59:44,692 --> 00:59:46,487
- Nick?
- Nick?

568
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,082
Hey, I'm right here!

569
00:59:48,182 --> 00:59:50,076
Nick! Hold on there, buddy!

570
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:53,166
Nick

571
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:01,940
It's a dog.

572
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:06,227
Dog...

573
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:07,457
My name is Nick Stokes.

574
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:14,435
If anybody finds this tape, turn it in
to the Las Vegas...

575
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:17,028
PD. There should be a reward.

576
01:02:26,399 --> 01:02:27,695
Mom...

577
01:02:28,592 --> 01:02:30,287
Cisco...

578
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:37,166
Well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye,
but it's all I've got.

579
01:02:41,752 --> 01:02:43,248
I love you.

580
01:02:44,145 --> 01:02:45,939
You raised me right...

581
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:50,127
And I'm going to miss you.

582
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,903
As for the rest of you guys,

583
01:02:58,003 --> 01:03:00,794
I know you did the best you could to find me.

584
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:10,863
Grissom...

585
01:03:20,733 --> 01:03:22,827
No, you never did, Nick.

586
01:03:38,479 --> 01:03:40,373
He's going into convulsions.

587
01:03:40,473 --> 01:03:42,168
He's losing it.

588
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:47,950
What's going on?

589
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:49,944
What is-?

590
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:54,530
Wait a minute.

591
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:03,802
Ants.

592
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:08,388
My God, he's being eaten alive.

593
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,906
That's it, Nicky.

594
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,498
Stay still.

595
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:12,791
They won't bite.

596
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:15,882
As much.

597
01:05:15,982 --> 01:05:17,876
This has got to be a prototype.

598
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:23,758
It was probably built to test
how long he could keep somebody alive inside.

599
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,223
Now, what are those?

600
01:05:35,323 --> 01:05:36,719
I don't know.

601
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,401
All right,

602
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:44,196
Based on this battery,

603
01:05:44,295 --> 01:05:46,588
And what's running off of it,

604
01:05:46,688 --> 01:05:50,277
And the fact that we kept the damn light on
for as long as we did,

605
01:05:51,174 --> 01:05:54,066
I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.

606
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:01,343
Oh, come on, pal.

607
01:06:01,443 --> 01:06:02,739
Yeah.

608
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:05,929
That's it.

609
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,525
Come on.

610
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,905
Little more.

611
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:17,694
Keep coming.

612
01:06:20,086 --> 01:06:22,280
Show me what you're made of.

613
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:24,872
Come on, buddy.

614
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:27,962
Gotcha!

615
01:06:52,786 --> 01:06:55,179
Solenopsis invicta.

616
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,672
They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada.
They don't like our soil.

617
01:06:57,771 --> 01:07:01,261
The only places you find them around Vegas
are in plant and tree nurseries.

618
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,152
There's eleven nurseries in the
greater Las Vegas area.

619
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:07,741
Okay, I've got the web cam trace down to here.

620
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:12,925
And the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck
gave us a 23-mile travel radius.

621
01:07:13,025 --> 01:07:17,511
Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area.

622
01:07:17,611 --> 01:07:19,804
Here and here.

623
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,300
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

624
01:07:21,399 --> 01:07:23,194
Kelly Gordon, the daughter,

625
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:24,490
Worked with plants,

626
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:25,985
Hold on. Hold on.

627
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,121
You guys, Nick...

628
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,417
Is here.

629
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:46,739
- You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound.
Where is it?

630
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:49,231
People usually prefer to stay away from it.

631
01:08:57,506 --> 01:08:59,799
All right, look. Fan out. Look for loose soil.

632
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:02,391
Anything that might've been dug up recently.

633
01:09:02,491 --> 01:09:03,687
That's the whole place.

634
01:09:29,608 --> 01:09:31,104
He-e-ey!

635
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:34,493
I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.

636
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,584
Move, Move.

637
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:17,961
This is it! I found it!

638
01:10:18,758 --> 01:10:20,054
It's here.

639
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,444
I found it! This is it!

640
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:29,924
Nick! Nick, we're here.
Hang on!

641
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:31,420
Nicky!

642
01:10:52,755 --> 01:10:55,048
It's a damn shame they didn't get to him sooner.

643
01:10:55,147 --> 01:10:57,141
I sure will miss him.

644
01:10:58,736 --> 01:11:01,328
You know, David, I've seen fire ant bites in my time,

645
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,921
But never anything like this.

646
01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:07,410
Do you think he suffered?

647
01:11:07,809 --> 01:11:10,002
Do I think he suffered?

648
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:12,594
Yes. Definitely

649
01:11:16,781 --> 01:11:18,177
All right.

650
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:19,772
On three.

651
01:11:19,872 --> 01:11:21,467
Uno... Dos...

652
01:11:21,567 --> 01:11:22,763
Tres!

653
01:11:26,452 --> 01:11:30,141
Would you care to do the "y" incision?

654
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,730
Well, "Y" not?

655
01:11:41,805 --> 01:11:44,198
Mind your hands and feet.

656
01:12:05,732 --> 01:12:08,025
He won't be needing this anymore

657
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,611
Nice.

658
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:13,708
Lung.

659
01:12:13,807 --> 01:12:15,402
So, Doctor.

660
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,097
How did my son die?

661
01:12:17,197 --> 01:12:18,692
Anaphylactic shock?

662
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,886
No, no, he didn't live long enough for that.

663
01:12:20,985 --> 01:12:23,278
COD was asphyxiation.

664
01:12:23,378 --> 01:12:27,565
- When the blood oxygen drops to less than 16%
and the CO2 builds up,

665
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,360
There's a rapid loss of consciousness,

666
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:34,145
Death within minutes with no disfiguring physical findings.

667
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:36,139
- He'll look great at the funeral.
- Oh, yes.

668
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,831
His mother will appreciate that.

669
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,109
Your son had a good heart.

670
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:25,888
No no no...

671
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,126
I hit something.

672
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,319
We got you, Nicky!

673
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:10,551
Hey!

674
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,246
Hey!

675
01:14:12,645 --> 01:14:15,137
We got you, man! Hey, Nicky!

676
01:14:15,237 --> 01:14:16,234
Nicky! Yeah.

677
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:19,823
Hey, hold on there.
Hey, put that down. Put that down.

678
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,219
Put that down. We got you.

679
01:14:21,318 --> 01:14:22,714
We're gonna get you out of here.

680
01:14:22,814 --> 01:14:24,210
Hang in there.

681
01:14:25,506 --> 01:14:26,503
Oh, my God.

682
01:14:26,602 --> 01:14:30,490
We need that fire extinguisher!
Give me that fire extinguisher.

683
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:47,339
Short bursts, Greg. Don't suffocate him!

684
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:55,614
Hang on, buddy. Hang on.

685
01:14:55,714 --> 01:14:58,904
- Almost had him.
- Get the paramedics!

686
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,293
Hang on. Hang on.

687
01:15:02,393 --> 01:15:05,384
We'll kill those ants, okay?
You listen to me.

688
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,166
Willows... Yeah. Hey, boss...

689
01:15:11,266 --> 01:15:13,061
We found him.
We're getting him out now.

690
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,257
That's great. Wai-wait.

691
01:15:14,357 --> 01:15:15,752
Don't-don't hang up. Just-just listen.

692
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:16,749
What? What?

693
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:18,843
Those dimples on the bottom of the prototype.

694
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:22,233
GCMS found traces of semtex on each one.

695
01:15:22,332 --> 01:15:23,429
You got to be kidding me.

696
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:25,024
Two! Three!

697
01:15:25,124 --> 01:15:28,513
Everyone out of the hole.
That box is ready to explode!

698
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:30,806
- Are you kidding?
- Get out of there now!

699
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:34,994
I'm not leaving without Nick.
There are charges under the box!

700
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:37,087
I'm not leaving here without him.

701
01:15:37,187 --> 01:15:40,377
Warrick, Catherine's right. Get out of the hole now.

702
01:15:40,477 --> 01:15:42,969
I know what we're gonna do. Just trust me.

703
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:53,836
We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now,
and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.

704
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:00,217
Nick!

705
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:02,310
Can you hear me?

706
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:06,697
It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay?

707
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,292
Nick!

708
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:11,881
Pancho!

709
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,975
Listen to me!

710
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,963
Put your hand on my hand.

711
01:16:20,754 --> 01:16:22,050
Good.

712
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:23,745
Now listen.

713
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:27,334
There may be explosives under the box.

714
01:16:27,434 --> 01:16:30,524
They're probably set on pressure switches.

715
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:40,295
We need to equalize your body weight
before we can pull you out, okay?

716
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:42,288
Pancho,

717
01:16:42,388 --> 01:16:45,279
Nod your head if you understand me.

718
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:52,757
Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe
to equalize his weight.

719
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:55,149
I need a rope and a caribiner.

720
01:16:55,249 --> 01:16:56,146
You got it.

721
01:16:56,246 --> 01:17:00,333
All right, Pancho,
we're gonna open the lid and get you out

722
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:03,823
But I need you to stay lying down. Okay?

723
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:06,116
Or else you'll blow us all up.

724
01:17:06,215 --> 01:17:08,110
You understand that?

725
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:10,901
Do you promise?

726
01:17:13,593 --> 01:17:16,484
Pancho, say, "I promise. "

727
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:17,880
I promise.

728
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:20,073
Bring it over. This way!

729
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,064
Don't move.

730
01:17:43,801 --> 01:17:45,795
All right, bring that over.

731
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,755
Okay, Pancho,

732
01:17:59,553 --> 01:18:02,544
I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.

733
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,936
Now!

734
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:08,725
Ready? Go!

735
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,421
I want my guys back.

736
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:06,366
You the one?

737
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:08,858
Yeah.

738
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,151
Yeah, back at you.

739
01:20:12,946 --> 01:20:14,740
What do you want me to say?

740
01:20:15,438 --> 01:20:16,834
I'm sorry?

741
01:20:16,934 --> 01:20:19,027
No, you didn't do anything to me.

742
01:20:20,623 --> 01:20:23,115
And what your dad did,

743
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:25,707
I...
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.

744
01:20:25,807 --> 01:20:27,601
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.

745
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:32,785
Pick it up.

746
01:20:39,764 --> 01:20:41,559
In a few years...

747
01:20:42,855 --> 01:20:44,550
When you get out of here...

748
01:20:46,444 --> 01:20:48,637
Don't take it with you.

749
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,616
That's it?

750
01:20:56,613 --> 01:20:57,410
Yeah.

751
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:59,005
Yeah, that's it.

752
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,196
We're done.

753
01:21:06,981 --> 01:21:08,277
That's it.
