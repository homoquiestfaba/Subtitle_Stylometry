IT'S OKAY.

DO YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?

00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,832
GOOD, BOY.

CHRISTY!

17
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,896
HEY, HOWARD HUGHES!
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME CALLING?

18
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,533
ELLIOTT WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE COMING TONIGHT.

19
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,002
UM...

20
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,737
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

21
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,672
I DON'T KNOW.

22
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,275
IT'S THE SEASON KICK-OFF PARTY.
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE.

23
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,676
MINDY, I'M JUST
NOT THAT INTERESTED.

24
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,479
HEY, CHRISTY.

25
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,751
HE IS SO IN LOVE WITH YOU,
IT MAKES ME SICK.

26
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,786
KYLE WALKER'S
NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.

27
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,824
I HOPE NOT. YOU DON'T
NEED SOMEONE LIKE THAT
TO RUIN YOUR REPUTATION.

28
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,827
MY REPUTATION?

29
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,863
WELL, YEAH.

30
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,731
WHAT DO YOU CARE ANYWAY?

00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,701
( indistinct chatter )

32
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,303
HEY, SWEETIE.

33
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,971
HEY, BABE.

34
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,840
SO, IS EVERYBODY
COMING TONIGHT?

35
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,443
OOH, CAN I DRIVE YOUR CAR?

36
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,312
NOBODY DRIVES
MY CAR BUT ME.

37
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,813
PLEASE?

38
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,548
( chuckles ) NO.

39
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,917
BUT YES, MOST OF THE TEAM
WILL BE THERE.

40
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,789
<i>MOST</i> OF THE TEAM,
BUT NOT <i>ALL,</i> RIGHT?

41
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,059
HE WOULDN'T DARE SHOW HIS FACE
AT SOCIAL EVENTS.

42
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:31,930
'CAUSE IF HE DID,
IT'D BE A SOCIAL FUNERAL.

43
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,533
( door closes )
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START
WHERE WE LEFT OFF YESTERDAY.

44
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,035
OPEN YOUR BOOKS TO PAGE 72.

45
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,872
CARTER, DID YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE
WITH THAT LAST NIGHT?

46
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,874
AND FOLLOW ALONG WITH ME.

47
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,011
THE DIAMETER OF THE MOON
IS ABOUT 261,000 MILES.

48
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,747
AND THE DISTANCE
FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON

49
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,551
IS ABOUT 283,000 MILES.

50
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:55,821
USE THESE NUMBERS
AND THE CONCEPT
OF SIMILAR TRIANGLES

51
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,390
TO COMPUTE THE DISTANCE.

52
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,792
( echoing )

53
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,528
HOW DOES THE DISTANCE
YOU COMPUTED

54
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,598
COMPARE TO THE DISTANCE
YOU MEASURED ON YOUR EXPERIMENT?

55
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,066
YES?

56
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,801
CAN I GET A DRINK OF WATER?

57
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,136
MM-HMM.

58
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,025
OH, MY GOD!

60
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,940
HEY. HEY!

61
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,809
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

62
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,811
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
REALLY WEIRD ALL DAY.

63
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:59,551
YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING
OF KYLE WALKER AND HOW MUCH
YOU WANT HIS HOT BODY, HUH?

64
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:01,420
I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA COME TONIGHT.

65
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,954
YOU HAVE TO COME.

66
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,823
ANYBODY WHO'S ANYBODY'S
GONNA BE THERE.

67
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,425
I JUST WANNA GET SOME SLEEP.

68
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,692
YOU'RE COMING.

69
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,561
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

70
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,830
YOU'RE COMING.

( indistinct chatter )

74
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,596
I DON'T KNOW WHY ELLIOTT
HATES KYLE. HE'S A GOOD GUY.

75
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,598
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

76
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,201
FOR SOME REASON, HE JUST--

77
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,840
THAT'S THE FUNNIEST--
THAT'S MY SHOE!

78
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,975
SHUT THE HELL UP
OR I'LL KICK YOUR--

79
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,510
OH, SHIT.

80
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,081
( gagging )

81
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,643
HEY, LYNN, STILL COMING OVER
WEDNESDAY NIGHT?

82
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,645
I'LL BE THERE.
8:00, RIGHT?

83
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,180
BULLSHIT.

84
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,983
THIS PARTY'S
FOR THE WHOLE TEAM, RIGHT?

85
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,652
THE LAST I CHECKED,
I'M STILL ON THE ROSTER.

86
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,921
NOT FOR LONG YOU AIN'T.

87
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,656
JUST KEEP DRINKING, HUH?

88
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,091
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

89
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,627
WHAT A DICK.

90
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,630
HEY.

91
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:57,669
NO, I LEAVE THE TRYING
UP TO OTHERS. I ACTUALLY
EMBARRASSED THE UNDERCLASSMEN.

92
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,638
RIGHT.

93
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
HEY, SO I MEANT TO ASK YOU
BUT YOU DISAPPEARED SO QUICKLY.

94
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,542
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?
NOTHING.

95
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,677
OH, WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
I SCREAM AND SHOUT "OH, MY GOD"

96
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,246
IN CLASS ALL THE TIME,
SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

97
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,981
IT'S-IT'S STUPID.

98
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:14,085
HEY, COME ON.
YOU CAN TELL ME, YOU KNOW.

99
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,088
WALKER! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

100
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,690
YOU LOVE TO RUIN MY SHIT.

101
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,559
THIS JUST FIGURES.

102
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,327
LOOK, MAN, I WASN'T TRYING
TO RUIN ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

103
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:28,099
BULLSHIT. YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO BE AN ASS AND SHOW UP
WHERE YOU'RE NOT WELCOME.

104
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,702
I WAS JUST LEAVING, ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE.

105
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:34,873
SEE, YOU TRY TO MAKE FRIENDS,
BUT YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

106
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,709
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
THEREFORE, NOBODY LIKES YOU.

107
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:41,313
NOW GET OUT OF HERE!
STOP IT. YOU'RE SO JUVENILE.

108
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,018
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

109
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,724
WE'RE TRYING TO LEAVE NOW.

110
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,294

111
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,334

112
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,172
( car drives off )

113
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,878
IF SHE NEVER BELIEVED YOU,
WHY SHOULD SHE BELIEVE ME?

114
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,016
MAYBE SHE WON'T,
BUT YOU WON'T KNOW
UNLESS YOU TRY.

115
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,931
( banging )

116
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,137
HELLO?

117
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,205
MOM?

118
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,045
( gasps )

119
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,281
CHRISTY?

120
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:27,118
MOM, WHAT?

121
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,254
MINDY CALLED.

122
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,991
I'M MAKING MYSELF
SOME BREAKFAST.
CAN I FIX YOU SOMETHING?

123
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,127
NOTHING. JUST COFFEE.

124
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,033
( sighs )

125
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,973
ROUGH NIGHT?

126
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,809
NOT REALLY.

127
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,144
WHAT TIME DID YOU GET IN?

128
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,746
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

129
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,981
WERE YOU DRINKING?
MOM...

130
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,150
WELL, WERE YOU?

131
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,952
NO.

132
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,361
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

133
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:14,432
YEAH. IT'S FINE.

134
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,476
( phone rings )

135
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,344
HELLO?

136
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,046
HEY, COACH.

137
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,381
SO DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT JACOBS'?

138
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,884
NO. NO, I DIDN'T HEAR.

139
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,486
WELL, AFTER YOU LEFT
LAST NIGHT,

140
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,955
WE REALLY STARTED TO PARTY.

141
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,389
REALLY?

142
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,391
WELL, EVERYONE ELSE DID.

143
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,160
ELLIOTT AND I
STAYED IN THE BARN
MOST OF THE NIGHT.

144
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,129
OH, PLEASE, SPARE ME.

145
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,364
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
IS HE OKAY?

146
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,367
OH, NO, HE'S TOTALLY FINE,
BUT HE GOT PULLED OVER.

147
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,836
AND GET THIS--
BECAUSE HE HAD
A TAIL LIGHT OUT.

148
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,371
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT
BECAUSE...?

149
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,973
WELL, HE HAD BEEN DRINKING.

150
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,208
DRINKING?

151
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,943
HE'S KICKED OFF THE TEAM.

152
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,813
YEAH. ELLIOTT'S BEEN
BITCHING ABOUT IT ALL DAY.

153
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,916
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
THIS PISSED OFF SINCE
WE LOST CONFERENCE LAST YEAR.

154
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,219
RIGHT, BUT SHOULDN'T ELLIOTT
SINCE HE'S THE CAP--

155
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,455
HE WOULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
TO THE POOR KID.

156
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,991
OH, THIS IS CLASSIC.

157
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,225
WHAT IS?

158
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,460
( both chuckle )

159
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,462
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
YEAH.

160
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,799
SO ANYWAY, I HOPE IT
DOESN'T EFFECT ELLIOTT'S...

161
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,467
GAMEPLAY,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

162
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,003
OH, MINDY...
( laughs )

163
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,337
IS THAT YOUR DAD?

164
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,240
YEAH.
WHO'S THE OLD GUY?

165
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:33,111
SOME PROFESSOR WHO WAS HELPING
MY DAD OUT WITH SOMETHING.

166
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,946
LOOK AT US.

167
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,849
MAN, I LOVE THAT OUTFIT.

168
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,484
I WAS CUTE.

169
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,386
( chuckles )

170
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,188
WHO KNEW, RIGHT?

171
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,533
YEAH, SURE, I'LL TALK TO HIM.

172
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,403
ALL RIGHT, COACH.

173
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,205
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

174
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,155
( birds chirping )

175
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,334
( engine starts )

176
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,514
WHAT AN IDIOT.

177
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,934
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
COACH CALLED ME.

178
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,069
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT WANTED.
SO BEAT IT.

179
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,437
HEY.

180
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,172
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

181
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,908
I GOT PULLED OVER, ALL RIGHT?

182
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,242
WHY WERE YOU DRIVING?

183
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,577
GOD, IF IT'S NOT MY PARENTS,
IT'S YOU.

184
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,579
I THOUGHT I WAS OKAY.

185
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,915
IT WAS ALMOST
3:00 IN THE MORNING,
SO I DROVE HOME.

186
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,583
HALFWAY HOME,
DIXON PULLED ME OVER

187
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,386
FOR A BROKEN TAIL LIGHT
AND SMELLED BEER.

188
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:25,056
HE NAILED ME WITH A D.W.I.,
UNDERAGE DRINKING,
AND THE BROKEN TAIL LIGHT.

189
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,925
I EARNED MYSELF
A ONE-WAY TICKET

190
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,459
OFF THE HOCKEY TEAM
AND INTO A.A.

191
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,195
WELL, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING--
I WON'T.

192
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,599
LOOK, I TRY TO DO
THE RIGHT THING,
BUT FORGET IT.

193
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,634
YOU GOT YOURSELF
INTO THIS MESS...

194
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,671
YOU'LL PAY THE CONSEQUENCES.

195
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,696
( gasps )

196
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,986
( indistinct
radio transmission )

197
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,122
I CAN'T GET THIS
DAMN THING TO WORK. HERE.

198
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,524
TELL THEM THEY HAVE
A BIG EXAM NEXT WEEK.

199
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,994
<i>STUDENTS OF MEAD HIGH,</i>

200
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,229
<i>CLASSES WILL BE CANCELED</i>
<i>UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.</i>

201
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:42,600
<i>I WOULD ASK THAT YOU PLEASE</i>
<i>LEAVE THE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY.</i>

202
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,544
( phone rings )

203
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,482
HEY.

204
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:02,186
<i>THEY BLOCKED TRAFFIC.</i>
<i>THEY'RE SAYING THAT</i>
<i>SCHOOL'S CANCELED.</i>

205
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,588
<i>WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

206
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,457
<i>HELLO? CHRISTY?</i>

207
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,493
<i>CHRISTY?</i>

208
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,496
Girl: WHAT HAPPENED?

209
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:13,231
CAN'T SAY. JUST BACK UP.

210
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,468
HEY.
HEY.

211
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,270
DO THEY KNOW WHO IT IS?

212
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,272
THEY AREN'T TALKING.

213
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,540
I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

214
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,108
DREAM ABOUT WHAT?

215
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,312
NEVER MIND.
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

216
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,715
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

217
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,584
I HAVE TO GO INSIDE.

218
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,454
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

219
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,791
KYLE, I HAD A DREAM
THAT SOMEONE DIED
IN THE GUYS' LOCKER ROOM.

220
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,226
I JUST WANNA SEE.
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE, CHRIS.

221
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,362
THEY'RE REMOVING THE BODY.
PLEASE.

222
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,198
I JUST WANNA SEE
WHERE IT HAPPENED.

223
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,440
( indistinct chatter )

224
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,080
IT'S OKAY, YOU CAN GO.
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

225
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,349
KYLE, SERIOUSLY.
CHRIS, I'M NOT
LEAVING YOU, OKAY?

226
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,684
OKAY.

227
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,358
WAIT.

228
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,427
MY NOTEPAD.

229
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,299
OKAY, LET'S GO.

230
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,345
Man 1:
WHAT DO WE TELL HIS PARENTS?

231
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,347
Man 2: WE'RE GONNA TELL THEM
THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A SUICIDE.

232
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,216
Man 2: BUT WE'RE GONNA TREAT IT
LIKE A MURDER INVESTIGATION

233
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,884
UNTIL WE GET THE RESULTS BACK
FROM THE AUTOPSY.

234
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,619
Man 1:
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER STUDENTS?

235
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,221
Man 2: WE'RE GONNA KEEP
THE SCHOOL LOCKED DOWN

236
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,755
UNTIL WE DO
A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.

237
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,359
Man 2: I'M GONNA NEED
A COMPLETE LIST OF EVERYBODY

238
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,361
THAT WAS IN THE SCHOOL
DURING THE WEEKEND,
JUST IN CASE.

239
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:57,535
WE MAKE SURE ALL STUDENTS
SIGN IN AND OUT IN THE OFFICE
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS.

240
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:00,538
SO, DO YOU THINK
WE HAVE FOUL PLAY HERE?

241
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,206
WE SHOULD GO.

242
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,812
( sighs )

243
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,515
SOMETHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

244
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,151
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

245
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,355
WE-WE WERE JUST ACTUALLY GOING--
THAT'S ENOUGH, OKAY?
THAT'S ENOUGH!

246
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,291
JOHNSON, TAKE THESE TWO
DOWN TO THE STATION
FOR QUESTIONING.

247
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,893
SCHOOL'S OFF LIMITS
RIGHT NOW, KIDS.

248
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,829
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

249
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,165
MM-HMM.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

250
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,168
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE,
NOT A PLAYGROUND. LET'S MOVE.

251
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,703
( bangs locker )
HEY! SETTLE DOWN!

252
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,572
YOU GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS
TO ANSWER.

253
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,745
( indistinct chatter )

254
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,394
I DON'T QUITE GRASP YOUR STORY.

255
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,729
I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

256
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,731
YOU JUST HAD TO SEE
A CRIME SCENE.

257
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,333
YES.

258
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,669
A CRIME SCENE THAT YOU
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

259
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,437
EXCEPT THAT YOU
HAD A DREAM ABOUT IT.

260
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,741
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT'S MY FAULT.

261
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,844
WE WANTED TO GET A CLOSER LOOK
AT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

262
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,347
IS THAT RIGHT?

263
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,616
NO, IT'S MY FAULT.
I MADE KYLE TAKE ME INSIDE.

264
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:21,219
SEE, I DON'T CARE
WHOSE FAULT IT WAS.

265
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,988
KYLE HAD A KEY TO THE SCHOOL...

266
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,358
AND THERE WAS NO FORCED ENTRY
INTO THE SCHOOL.

267
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,794
YOU WANNA EXPLAIN
THAT ONE, KYLE?

268
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,364
YOU CAN ASK MS. WILLIAMS
ABOUT THAT IF YOU WANT.

269
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:37,235
I DON'T WANNA ASK MS. WILLIAMS.
I'M ASKING YOU.

270
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:42,740
I'M A T.A. SO I HAVE IT
IN CASE THEY NEED ME TO SET UP
IN THE MORNINGS, ALL RIGHT?

271
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,677
DID MS. WILLIAMS NEED YOU
TO SET UP DURING THE WEEKEND?

272
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,779
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE SCHOOL ON THE WEEKEND?

273
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,581
THE TEAM WAS WORKING OUT.

274
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,620
MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN
WHY THE ONLY TWO NAMES

275
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,688
ON THIS ENTIRE LIST
THAT DIDN'T SIGN OUT

276
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,825
WERE YOU AND ERIC JACOBS.

277
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,927
I GUESS I FORGOT.

278
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,663
YOU FORGOT.

279
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,766
ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY
YOU MIGHT HAVE FORGOT, KYLE?

280
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,802
I DON'T THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

281
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:16,607
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER
ON THIS TEAM MANAGED TO SIGN OUT
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

282
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:25,850
WELL, UNLIKE THE REST
OF THE TEAM, I CARE
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

283
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:29,687
SO AFTER THE WORKOUT,
I WENT INTO THE ART ROOM
TO WORK ON A PROJECT.

284
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,291
REALLY? LET ME ASK YOU
ANOTHER QUESTION, KYLE.

285
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,526
WERE YOU AND ERIC JACOBS CLOSE?

286
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,296
WE'RE TEAMMATES,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

287
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,898
NO. WERE YOU CLOSE?
WERE YOU FRIENDS?

288
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,568
NO, NOT REALLY.

289
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,838
CHRISTY? WERE YOU
AND ERIC JACOBS CLOSE?

290
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,674
NO.

291
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,976
THEN WHY IN GOD'S NAME
WERE YOU TWO IN THAT SCHOOL?

292
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,378
IF HE WASN'T FRIENDS
WITH EITHER ONE OF YOU,

293
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,514
THEN HOW DID YOU
EVEN KNOW HE WAS MISSING?

294
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,684
I TOLD YOU, I HAD A DREAM
THAT SOMEONE DIED THERE.

295
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,953
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU DREAMED IT.

296
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:06,557
THIS IS A QUIET TOWN,
AND I WANNA KEEP IT THAT WAY.

297
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,661
YOU TWO STAY PUT
UNTIL YOUR PARENTS ARRIVE.

298
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,700
( door closes )

299
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,005
I'M REALLY SORRY, KYLE.

300
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,707
DON'T BE.

301
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,575
I FEEL REALLY BAD.

302
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:27,345
IT'S FINE.

303
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:33,551
STILL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I AM SORRY.

304
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:36,554
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE,
ALL RIGHT?

305
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,033
OH, BABY,
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
ARE YOU OKAY?

306
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,036
Kyle: MOM. MOM, I'M FINE.
YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

307
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,905
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, KYLE?
WHY THE HELL WERE YOU THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

308
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:58,409
IT'S A LONG STORY.
SERIOUSLY, CAN WE
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

309
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,544
I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU BECAUSE
I DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED.

310
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,414
HONEY, YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

311
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,982
I KNOW.

312
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:09,787
( phone rings )

313
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,856
THIS IS DIXON.

314
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,925
REALLY?

315
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,994
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN?

316
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,100
I APPRECIATE YOU
LETTING ME KNOW.

317
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,569
THANK YOU.

318
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,672
THAT WAS THE CORONER'S OFFICE.
THEY'VE COMPLETED THE AUTOPSY.

319
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:32,710
AND?
ERIC JACOBS' DEATH
WAS NOT A SUICIDE.

320
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:35,179
THERE'S BRUISING ON HIS NECK
TO INDICATE THAT
HE WAS STRANGLED.

321
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:39,049
WHOEVER DID THIS
STAGED IT TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE HE HUNG HIMSELF.

322
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,752
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SAYING,
HOWARD?

323
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,023
I'M SAYING THIS
IS OFFICIALLY
A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

324
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,669
( engine starts )

325
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,052
MAY I HELP YOU?

326
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,054
PROFESSOR McGREGOR?
YES?

327
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:27,658
MY NAME'S CHRISTY DAWSON.
YES, TED'S DAUGHTER.

328
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,595
I WONDERED WHEN
YOU WOULD STOP BY.
PLEASE, COME IN.

329
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,671
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO.

330
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:43,941
MY FATHER SPOKE OF YOU OFTEN.

331
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:47,945
HE TOLD ME THAT YOU TAUGHT
A CLASS IN PARAPSYCHOLOGY,

332
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,681
AND I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE...

333
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:54,018
THAT I MAY
BETTER EXPLAIN THINGS TO YOU.

334
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:59,023
SINCE HE DIED, I'VE BEEN
HAVING THIS RECURRING DREAM
ABOUT MY DAD.

335
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,892
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT
ANYTHING OF IT, BUT...

336
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,962
IT SEEMED REAL.

337
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,566
DID YOU FATHER SPEAK TO YOU?

338
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,570
YOU WERE RIGHT TO COME TO ME.

339
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,239
I WONDERED IF
YOU WOULD RECEIVE IT.

340
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,740
SORRY?

341
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,876
YOUR GIFT.

342
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:21,312
YOU ARE A DREAMER, CHRISTY.

343
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:29,219
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO DREAM OF AND EVEN INTERACT
WITH A SPIRIT OR GHOST.

344
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:34,224
I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT YOU WERE TALKING WITH
YOUR FATHER IN THAT DREAM.

345
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:38,195
IT'S A TEST,
HIS WAY OF MAKING SURE
THAT YOU POSSESS

346
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,197
THE TRAITS
AND QUALITIES NEEDED.

347
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,800
WHY DIDN'T HE
SAY ANYTHING TO ME
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE?

348
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,737
YOUR ABILITIES
ARE STILL ADVANCING, CHRISTY.

349
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,741
THEY WILL SOON
ESCALATE FAR BEYOND
THOSE YOUR FATHER HAD.

350
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,611
IT WILL HAPPEN IN STAGES.

351
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,279
YOUR COMMUNICATIONS
WITH THE SPIRIT WORLD

352
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,748
WILL BECOME
MORE UNDERSTANDABLE.

353
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,883
YOU MAY EVEN NEED
TO TAKE VENGEANCE

354
00:26:59,885 --> 00:27:02,019
FOR THE WRONGFUL DEATH
OF A SPIRIT,

355
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:06,223
FREEING IT FROM CAPTIVITY
ON OUR PLANE OF EXISTENCE.

356
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:08,792
I HAVE BEEN HAVING
THIS NEW DREAM LATELY...

357
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,661
WITH A LITTLE BOY.

358
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,163
HE SEEMS FAMILIAR TO ME, BUT...

359
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,166
YOU WILL FIND OUT SOON
I'M SURE.

360
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,901
YOU HAVE
ALL THE ATTRIBUTES

361
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,905
TO BECOME
A VERY ADVANCED MEDIUM.

362
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,708
MY MOTHER
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS.

363
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,912
SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO.

364
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,372
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
WOULD NEVER GET HOME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU TODAY?

365
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,042
THE RUMOR MILL
HAS BEEN RUNNING NONSTOP.

366
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:00,411
SO I HEARD THAT YOU
AND WALKER WERE ARRESTED.

367
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,279
WE WEREN'T ARRESTED,
WE WERE QUESTIONED,

368
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,348
AND IT WAS ENTIRELY MY FAULT,
NOT KYLE'S.

369
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,117
SO YOU WEREN'T HANDCUFFED
AND TAKEN DOWNTOWN?

370
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,055
I THOUGHT IT WOULD MEAN
WALKER WOULD BE OFF THE TEAM.

371
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,791
GLAD TO SEE
YOU HAVE YOUR PRIORITIES, MIN.

372
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,459
WHAT?

373
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,796
SO ANYWAY,
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

374
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,197
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE NOT
TELLING ME WHAT HAPPENED,

375
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:27,371
RUMORS ARE JUST
FARFETCHED ALTERCATIONS
OF THE TRUTH.

376
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,773
ALTERCATIONS?
WHATEVER.

377
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,209
SO DID YOU REALLY
BREAK INTO THE SCHOOL?

378
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,812
KYLE SORT OF HAD A KEY.

379
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,881
A KEY? TO THE SCHOOL?

380
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,284
TO THE ART ROOM. HE'S A T.A.

381
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:43,153
HE IS SUCH A NERD.

382
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:46,223
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

383
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,058
DO WHAT?

384
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,127
BAD MOUTH KYLE ALL THE TIME.

385
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,463
I DON'T.

386
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:57,134
OKAY, SO MAYBE I DO,
BUT KYLE WALKER'S A LOSER
AND HE DESERVES IT.

387
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:01,872
WELL, HE DOES.
OKAY. WELL,
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

388
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:04,408
BUT-BUT YOU DIDN'T FINISH
TELLING ME WHAT HAPPENED.

389
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,011
AND I DON'T DOUBT
YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME LATER
AND ASK ME EVERYTHING IN DETAIL.

390
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,249
( sighs )

391
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,851
I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST REALLY TIRED.

392
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:15,853
BUT I REALLY WANNA KNOW.

393
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,988
JUST CALL ME LATER.

394
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,323
BYE.

395
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,533

396
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,544
( phone rings )

397
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:43,147
YOU MISS ME ALREADY?

398
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,048
NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

399
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,950
KYLE?

400
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,318
YEAH. DID I CALL AT A BAD TIME?

401
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,554
NO. MINDY JUST LEFT.

402
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,156
<i>I THOUGHT IT WAS HER CALLING.</i>

403
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:53,791
AND HOW IS THE DRAMA QUEEN?

404
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,058
THE SAME.

405
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,161
WELL, NO SURPRISE THERE.

406
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,263
OH, NO?
<i>NO.</i>

407
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,468
SO WHAT'S UP?

408
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,070
WITH THE CALL, I MEAN.

409
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,072
WELL, I GUESS
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

410
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,474
I JUST NEEDED TO TALK TO SOMEONE

411
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,945
<i>FOR BREAKING INTO</i>
<i>A RESTRICTED AREA.</i>

412
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,981
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
IT'S JUST REALLY...

413
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,083
CONFUSING.

414

YEAH, AND...

415
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,887

<i>YES.</i>

416
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,323

00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,493
LISTEN, CHRISTY, I, UM...

418
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,428
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, KYLE.

419
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,498
WELL, NEITHER DO I, BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK.

420
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,567
YOU WEREN'T?

421
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,168
NO.

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,268
SHUT UP, VAN OWEN.
GET OUT OF HERE.

516
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,839
OH, CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?
YOU'RE MY HERO. ( laughs )

517
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,440
HA HA. YEAH, YEAH.

518
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,843
HEY, WALKER, GREAT GAME.

519
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,712
NICE GAME, BUD.
THANKS.

520
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,782
DON'T THINK THIS
CHANGES ANYTHING.

521
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:29,186
ONE GOOD GAME
DOESN'T MAKE YOU A SOMEBODY.

522
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,388
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE THE RESPECT
I GET AS CAPTAIN.

523
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,390
YEAH, WELL, KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT, HUH?

524
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,325
WHEN I'M ON THE ICE,
I PLAY FOR ME.

525
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,661
MAYBE THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

526
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,222
GOOD GAME TONIGHT, KYLE.
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

527
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,330
LOOK, A BUNCH OF US GUYS
ARE GETTING TOGETHER
AT MY HOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT.

528
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:16,733
WE THOUGHT IT'D BE
GOOD TO GET TOGETHER
FOR SUPPORT AND SHIT.

529
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,436
JACOBS WASN'T
THAT BAD OF A GUY.

530
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:23,707
HE JUST LIKED THE ATTENTION
HE GOT WHEN SMITHE STARTED
STICKING UP FOR HIM.

531
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,442
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

532
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:28,778
IT'S NOT JUST
SMITHE AND JACOBS.

533
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,280
THE WHOLE TEAM ACTED LIKE
I WAS SOME SORT OF A VIRUS

534
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:33,817
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT?

535
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:35,652
LOOK, YOU PLAYED WELL TONIGHT.

536
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,787
ISN'T IT ENOUGH
YOU'VE REGAINED OUR RESPECT?

537
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,489
WHAT DID I EVER DO
TO LOSE IT, HUH?

538
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,625
( chuckles )

539
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,486
( locks )

540
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,360
ELLIOTT. ELLIOTT, WAIT.

541
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,063
SWEETIE, STOP.
GOOD GOD!

542
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,731
GET UP.

543
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,900
WELL, YOU COULD HELP ME.
PLEASE.

544
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,640
YOU CAN GO ON WITHOUT ME.

545
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:36,579
I WAS SO EXCITED.
YOU WERE DOING SO WELL.
LISTEN TO ME, MINDY.

546
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,915
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS,
OKAY? GOD DAMN IT, MINDY.

547
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,318
JUST SHUT UP!

548
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,386
OKAY.

549
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:45,855
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

550
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,558
YEAH.

551
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,755
JESUS CHRIST, KYLE.

552
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:21,391
SORRY.
IT'S OKAY.

553
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,497
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

554
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,099
THEY WENT HOME, I GUESS.

555
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:34,904
WHAT IS IT?

556
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,906
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THE OTHER GUYS SAID.

557
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:40,043
TWO-FACED SONS OF BITCHES
IS WHAT THEY ARE.

558
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,644
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE HARSH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

559
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,446
NO, I DON'T, ACTUALLY.

560
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,419
NEVER MIND.
I'M SORRY.

561
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:53,556
CHRISTY, THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU
FOR A WHILE NOW.

562
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,558
YEAH?

563
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,061
LISTEN, I KNOW THE TIMING IS BAD
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED.

564
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,064
I JUST DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
TO HAPPEN BEFORE.

565
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,832
WHERE YOU GOING?

566
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,467
PLEASE, JUST TALK TO ME.

567
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:11,941
( groaning )

568
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,702
I'M GONNA GO CALL 911.

569
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,771
CHRISTY, IT'S NOT
THE WAY IT LOOKS.

570
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,041
DAMN IT.

571
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,526
THANKS, LYNNIE.
ANY TIME.

572
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:06,129
HEY, YOU PROMISE
YOU'LL GIVE ME A CALL
IF HE KEEPS THIS UP?

573
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,131
YEAH, HE'S FINE.
HE JUST NEEDED TIME
TO COOL OFF.

574
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,732
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GOOD, YEAH.

575
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,000
TAKE CARE.
BYE.

576
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,469
SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

577
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,803
BE CAREFUL.

578
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,740
Christy: NO, IT'S NOT A JOKE.

579
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,175
I'M SERIOUS!

580
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:27,016
( groaning )

581
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,053
ELLIOTT?

582
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,888
ELLIOTT, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

583
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,490
WHERE'S ELLIOTT?

584
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,525
IT WAS JUST--
MINDY, STOP!

585
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,828
Kyle: ELLIOTT, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

586
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,230
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

587
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,698
WHAT? I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

588
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,132
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

589
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,767
WHAT, YOU'RE
COVERING FOR HIM NOW?

590
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,035
YEAH. NO. WHAT?

591
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,837
DON'T MOVE.
DON'T TOUCH HIM!

592
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,240
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
YOU'RE A LOUSY LIAR.

593
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:53,977
I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF ANYTHING IS WRONG WITH HIM,

594
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,845
I WILL KILL YOU MYSELF!

595
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,214
MINDY...
MINDY, WE FOUND THEM LIKE THIS.

596
00:41:58,216 --> 00:41:59,949
SHUT UP. SHUT UP!

597
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,951
WHAT, YOU DIDN'T
HURT HIM ENOUGH LAST YEAR?

598
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,922
YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D FINISH HIM OFF?!

599
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:08,591
( groans )

600
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:12,061
I'M SO SORRY, SWEETIE.
IT'S OKAY, I GOT YOU.
IT'S OKAY, HELP'S COMING.

601
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:15,298
IT'S OKAY, SHE'S JUST UPSET.
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE TO BLAME.

602
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,302
WELL, WHY WOULD
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO ME?

603
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,208
THEY ALWAYS LOOK LIKE THIS
AFTER A GAME.

604
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:30,547
( siren wailing )

605
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:31,881
CHRISTY.

606
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,221
( siren wails )

607
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:42,025
( indistinct
radio transmission )

608
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,638
I'M SORRY.

609
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,908
Cop: THE FIRST TIME
YOU SAW THE VICTIMS
WAS WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

610
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,011
YES. WAIT,
I MEAN NO, NO, NO. I WAS...

611
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,247
YES, I WAS WITH CHRISTY,
BUT NO, SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

612
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,849
WHAT'S WITH THE KNUCKLES?
I TOLD YOU.

613
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,719
I GOT A NEW PAIR OF GLOVES AND
THEY AREN'T BROKEN IN YET.
- YEAH.

614
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:14,257
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, CHRISTY.

615
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,993
I DO.
THEN YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY I HAVE TO TAKE YOU

616
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,728
TO THE STATION
FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING.

617
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,897
I UNDERSTAND.

618
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,765
YOU KNOW,
I-I JUST DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

619
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:28,171
YOU HAVE BEEN
AT TWO CRIME SCENES
IN THE SAME NUMBER OF DAYS.

620
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:32,208
AND?
AND I'M TAKING YOU IN
FOR FURTHER QUESTIONING.

621
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,312
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY ARE YOU CUFFING ME?

622
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,915
ROB.

623
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,250
I'M TAKING HIM IN, CHIEF.
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

624
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:44,153
WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
I'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
YOU WANT.

625
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:47,724
WERE YOU WITH HIM
ALL NIGHT, CHRISTY?

626
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:51,394
CAN YOU BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT HE DIDN'T KILL
CARTER VAN OWEN?

627
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,329
OR ASSAULT JOSEPH TURNER?

628
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,931
OR ELLIOTT SMITHE?

629
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,966
HE WOULDN'T.
HE WOULDN'T.

630
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,402
I NEED YOU TO BE
ABSOLUTELY SURE.

631
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:05,842
HE... I... KYLE, I--

632
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,744
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL GO WITH THEM.

633
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,245
NO, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

634
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,848
AFRAID THAT'S
NOT POSSIBLE, CHRISTY.

635
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:17,720
ROB, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE CARE OF MS. DAWSON HERE.

636
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:21,924
I'D LIKE A WORD
WITH MR. WALKER... ALONE.

637
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,198
( siren wails )

638
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,144
( indistinct
radio transmission )

639
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:46,182
( engine starts )

640
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,020
( siren wails )

641
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,291
STOP IT.

642
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,260
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

643
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,861
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE--

644
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,797
KYLE WALKER
BETTER WATCH HIMSELF.

645
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,701
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HIM,
I'M GONNA RIP HIS EYES OUT.

646
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,103
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU SHOWED UP WHEN YOU DID.

647
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:09,238
OTHERWISE, WHO KNOWS
WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED.

648
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,841
YOU KNOW,
I KNEW HE WAS A FREAK.

649
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:15,712
BUT I DIDN'T THINK
HE'D GO AS FAR AS...

650
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:19,716
( sighs )
ANYWAY...

651
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,983
I STOPPED HIM.

652
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,119
( chuckles )

653
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:26,255
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D EVER DO
IF I LOST YOU.

654
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:29,058
COME HERE.

655
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,034
( chuckles )

656
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,870
I THINK YOU'LL BE BACK
TO YOUR OLD SELF IN NO TIME.

657
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,042
OW.

658
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:50,179
I'M SORRY.
DID I HURT YOU?

659
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,982
IT'S NOTHING THAT WON'T HEAL.

660
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,050
I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

661
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,787
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO US
ALL A FAVOR AND KEEP
THAT BIG MOUTH SHUT.

662
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:34,190
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE
JOHNSON JERK YOU OFF
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

663
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:37,260
LET'S SEE HOW TOUGH
YOU ARE INSIDE, FELLA, HUH?

664
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,199
( beeping )

665
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,241
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS.

666
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,244
DON'T I? YOU'RE NOT
A MINOR ANYMORE, KYLE.

667
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,380
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
YOU CAN'T ARREST ME.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

668
00:46:57,382 --> 00:46:59,515
DON'T TELL ME
HOW TO DO MY JOB.

669
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:02,318
I CAN HOLD YOU
FOR UP TO 48 HOURS.

670
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,556
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

671
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:09,559
WELL, EVERYTHING YOU SAID
DOESN'T QUITE ADD UP.

672
00:47:09,561 --> 00:47:13,396
DID YOU CHECK THE WOODS?
DID ANYBODY EVEN TRY
TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER SUSPECT?

673
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:16,132
WE DON'T HAVE TO.
WE ALREADY SPOKE
WITH ELLIOTT SMITHE.

674
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:19,168
HE GAVE US A STATEMENT
TELLING US THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT ASSAULTED THEM.

675
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,904
WELL, WHAT ABOUT JOE?
HE'LL TELL YOU I WASN'T THERE.

676
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:28,010
JOE TURNER?
JOE TURNER'S GONNA BE LUCKY
IF HE EVEN LIVES, KYLE.

677
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,554
I'M FINE, DAD, REALLY.

678
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:41,290
YOUR MOTHER CAN BRING SOMETHING
OVER LATER IF YOU NEED IT.

679
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,292
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

680
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,895
I DOUBT THAT.
LOOK AT ME, DAD.

681
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:47,496
HOW IS EVERYTHING
GONNA BE OKAY?

682
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:49,432
I'M COMPLETELY FUCKED!

683
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,033
WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE.

684
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,635
HOCKEY'S THE LEAST
OF OUR WORRIES.

685
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:56,105
ARE WE DONE?
THIS ISN'T A GAME, SON.

686
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:59,075
YOU COULD STILL
BE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

687
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,078
( chuckles )
WELL, THANKS.

688
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,982
BUT I'M A BIG BOY NOW.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

689
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:08,651
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
( chuckles )

690
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:11,420
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
TURNER'S DEAD.

691
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,023
( door opens )

692
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,392
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS LATER.

693
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:25,067
HEY. IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR MINDY,
SHE SHOULD BE BACK SOON.

694
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,670
SHE WAS HERE ALL NIGHT.
SHE WENT HOME TO GET SOME SLEEP.

695
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:31,073
YEAH, I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH
LAST NIGHT EITHER.

696
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,542
( chuckles )
OUT PARTYING, HUH?

697
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,412
NOT EXACTLY.

698
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,282
HOW YOU DOING, L?

699
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:44,120
I'M GREAT, CHRIS.
I THINK I'LL RUN
A MARATHON LATER.

700
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,123
SERIOUSLY.
I CAME TO SEE HOW YOU WERE.

701
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:50,092
I'M IN PAIN.
I HAVEN'T SHOWERED.

702
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:55,364
I HATE BEING IN HERE AGAIN.
IT MAKES ME FEEL WEAK.

703
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,701
YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD, THOUGH,
ASIDE FROM THE BRUISES.

704
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,610
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

705
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,147
( chuckles )
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

706
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,117
IT WAS WALKER.

707
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,453
HE'S COMPLETELY LOST IT.

708
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,390
WE'RE NOT KIDS ANYMORE.

709
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:24,460
KYLE'S A DANGEROUS GUY.

710
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,063
YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

711
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,098
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

712
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,469
NOTHING.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

713
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,138
KYLE WOULD NEVER HURT YOU.

714
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,275
WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT
SOMEONE TRYING TO KILL ME?

715
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:43,012
HEY. I BROUGHT THE, UH--

716
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,614
YOUR FRIEND HERE
IS SIDING WITH
HER BOYFRIEND.

717
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,550
WHAT?

718
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:50,386
IT WAS DARK.
ELLIOTT MUST NOT HAVE SEEN--

719
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,154
I SAW PERFECTLY WELL.

720
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,690
COME ON,
YOU KNOW HE WOULDN'T HURT YOU.

721
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:58,160
GET OUT OF HERE. YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T RESPECT OUR FRIENDSHIP

722
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,697
IF YOU'RE TRUSTING SOME FREAK
OVER TWO OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

723
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:05,134
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS WOULD--

724
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:09,772
WE WERE BOTH THERE.
WALKER WAS STANDING
OVER ELLIOTT.

725
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,209
THAT'S ALL THE PROOF I NEED.

726
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,678
JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

727
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,587
SO HOW'S THE SEASON GOING?
THERE IS NO SEASON.

728
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,188
BUT I HEARD
THINGS WERE GOING WELL.

729
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,456
WELL, THEN YOU HEARD WRONG.

730
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,058
MR. SMITHE...

731
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,594
I-I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME,

732
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:34,630
BUT MY NAME'S CHRISTY DAWSON--
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

733
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,133
I'M A LITTLE DISTRACTED,
AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL.

734
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,068
YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND.

735
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,536
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

736
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,471
MAYBE.
WHAT IS IT?

737
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,474
WELL, I DON'T WANNA PRY, BUT...

738
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,209
FORGET IT.

739
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,079
NO, TELL ME.
YOU WON'T OFFEND ME.

740
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:54,183
I KNOW THEY DON'T GET ALONG MUCH
ANYMORE, BUT KYLE WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING TO HURT ELLIOTT.

741
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,186
CHRISTY, ELLIOTT'S UPSET.

742
00:50:57,188 --> 00:51:00,723
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,
THEY CANCELED THE REST
OF OUR HOCKEY SEASON.

743
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,159
HE'S A LOT OF THINGS,
BUT HE'S NOT A LIAR.

744
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:06,362
THE POLICE WON'T PUT
THE WRONG MAN IN JAIL.

745
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:08,097
THEY ALREADY HAVE.

746
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,799
GO HOME, CHRISTY.

747
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:13,536
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHERE ELLIOTT'S CONCERNED.

748
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,604
IT WAS NICE CHATTING WITH YOU.

749
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,115
( laughter )

750
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,150
GO! GO!
GET OVER HERE!

751
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,389
I GOT IT!

752
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,790
OVER HERE!

753
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,793
COME ON!

754
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,795
ELLIOTT.

755
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:42,665
YOU KNOW THAT
PICTURE OF ELLIOTT?
YEAH.

756
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:46,335
I THINK HE'S CUTE.
I THINK KYLE'S CUTE.

757
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,471
I DON'T LIKE KYLE.
HOW COME?

758
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,805
JUST BECAUSE.

759
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,342
HEY, CHRISTY.

760
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,677
HI. HI, KYLE.

761
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,812
HEY.
WHO ARE YOU?

762
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,882
THIS IS MY FRIEND MINDY.
SHE JUST MOVED HERE
FROM INDIANA.

763
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,684
HEY.
HEY.

764
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:03,819
Boy: HEY, GUYS,
ARE WE PLAYING OR NOT?

765
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:05,554
CHRISTY, YOU WANNA PLAY?

766
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,156
SURE. MINDY?

767
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,291
OKAY, BUT I AM NOT
PLAYING GOALIE.

768
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,171
( beeping )

769
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:29,778
( beeping )

770
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,189
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

771
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,590
I HAD TO SEE YOU.

772
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:43,592
ARE YOU OKAY?

773
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,462
I'M HANGING IN THERE.

774
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:49,331
KYLE, I'M REALLY SORRY.
I MESSED UP.

775
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,333
CHRIS, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
I'M IN HERE.

776
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,269
IT WAS MY DREAM.
CHRISTY...

777
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,214
I WENT AND SAW ELLIOTT TODAY.

778
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:07,216
WHAT'D HE HAVE TO SAY?

779
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:11,754
HE SAID YOU WERE THE ONE THAT...

780
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:15,357
HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE
AND TOLD ME THAT
YOU ATTACKED THEM.

781
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,494
LISTEN TO ME. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ELLIOTT.

782
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:21,931
BUT ALL I KNOW IS THAT
HE STILL THINKS I BROKE
HIS COLLARBONE LAST YEAR.

783
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:25,668
UGH!
ELLIOTT!

784
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,603
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

785
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:30,206
YEAH, WELL,
TRY TELLING HIM THAT.

786
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:33,209
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.
I NEVER WOULD'VE
DONE THAT TO HIM.

787
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,810
I KNOW.

788
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,216
YOU WOULDN'T LIE TO ME,
WOULD YOU?

789
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:43,352
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

790
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:48,991
I SPENT THE LAST YEAR
CONFUSED OUT OF MY MIND AS TO
WHY WE WEREN'T FRIENDS ANYMORE.

791
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,894
AND NOW?

792
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,297
I MISS YOU.

793
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,299
( door opens )

794
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,635
Man: MS. DAWSON, TIME'S UP.

795
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:02,238
KYLE...

796
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,807
DON'T GET YOURSELF
INTO ANY MORE TROUBLE.

797
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,710
OKAY, I'LL TRY NOT TO.

798
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:12,848
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
I MIGHT NOT BE CRAZY AFTER ALL.

799
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:17,486
COME ON. YOU'RE ABOUT AS CRAZY
AS I AM A MURDERER.

800
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,503
( birds chirping )

801
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,326
HONEY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

802
00:54:57,328 --> 00:55:00,863
LOOK, I CAN CALL THE HOSPITAL,
GET SOMEONE TO COVER.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

803
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:03,499
I'LL BE FINE.
IT'S OKAY, GO.

804
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:08,470
YOU'LL CALL MY CELL PHONE
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING AT ALL.

805
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,739
AND YOU'LL LOCK THE DOOR
AFTER I GO...

806
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,741
AND AGAIN
AFTER LYNN GETS HERE.

807
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:14,009
I WILL.

808
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,944
OKAY.

809
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:18,414
MOM...

810
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,417
KYLE'S GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

811
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:25,554
HONEY, IF YOU THINK
KYLE IS INNOCENT, I DO, TOO.

812
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,556
I TRUST YOU.

813
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:30,025
HOWIE'S GONNA SEE THAT AS WELL.

814
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,895
YOU TRY TO GET SOME REST, OKAY?

815
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,966
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

816
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,770
I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.

817
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,088
( phone rings )

818
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:03,092
LYNN, YOU BETTER HAVE
A DAMN GOOD REASON
FOR BEING LATE.

819
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:05,094
HELLO?

820
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:06,962
LYNN?

821
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:08,430
( dial tone )

822
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,898
( phone beeps )

823
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:18,907
Mindy: <i>STOP IT! ( laughs )</i>
<i>OH, HI, CHRISTY.</i>

824
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,376
WHAT HAPPENED?

825
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:23,912
<i>SHH. UM, WHAT? WHEN?</i>

826
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:29,385
<i>SHH. HUH?</i>
<i>I DIDN'T CALL BEFORE.</i>

827
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,920
<i>ANYWAY, I DON'T THINK</i>
<i>I'M GONNA MAKE IT TONIGHT.</i>

828
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,789
WHAT? WHY?

829
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,791
<i>I JUST--</i>
<i>I'M SORRY.</i>

830
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:37,793
<i>SOMETHING'S COME UP.</i>

831
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:39,561
<i>YOU'LL BE OKAY,</i>
<i>THOUGH, WON'T YOU?</i>

832
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,830
<i>I MEAN, YOU SHOULD BE SAFE.</i>

833
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:43,699
YEAH, I'VE GOT THE DOG.

834
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:46,969
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>OKAY, THANKS, CHRISTY.</i>

835
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,437
<i>LOVE YOU. BYE.</i>

836
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:49,705
( dial tone )

837
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,840
( phone beeps )
BYE.

838
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:54,510
( sighs )

839
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,814
( crickets chirping )

840
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,175
( beeping )

841
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,821
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

842
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:41,757
I HAVE A FEELING
SOMETHING TERRIBLE
IS GONNA HAPPEN.

843
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:44,893
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,
EVERYBODY'S SAFE.

844
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,496
YEAH, DON'T COUNT ON IT.

845
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,764
EXCUSE ME?

846
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,466
I SAID DON'T COUNT ON IT!

847
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:52,034
I'M A SITTING DUCK IN HERE!

848
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,603
YOU'LL BE FINE.

849
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,772
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO START
SLINGING AROUND ACCUSATIONS

850
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:58,974
WHILE YOU'RE
SITTING IN HERE, KYLE.

851
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:03,846
I'M NOT ACCUSING ANYBODY,
BUT PEOPLE ARE DYING
AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE NEXT!

852
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:07,182
YEAH, UM...
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

853
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,255
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!
I'M INNOCENT!

854
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,992
( bangs door )

855
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,196
( crickets chirping )

856
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:23,665
RUDY. COME ON.

857
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,642
( choking )

858
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,280
( banging )

859
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,286
( beeping )

860
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,237
WHO'S WATCHING
ELLIOTT TONIGHT?

861
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,573
WHY WOULD WE
WANNA WATCH HIM?

862
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,142
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE TAKING SHIFTS
KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM.

863
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:10,646
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?
WE ALREADY CAUGHT THE KILLER.

864
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:13,215
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS.

865
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,217
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

866
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,986
WHY WOULD ANYBODY LIE ABOUT
SOMEBODY TRYING TO KILL THEM?

867
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:22,124
( groans ) YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE MISTAKE THAT YOU'RE MAKING.

868
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:24,293
( groans )

869
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:27,095
WALKER? WALKER!

870
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:36,638
( grunts )

871
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,042
( groans )

872
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:17,212
( thunder rumbles )

873
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,615
( gasps )

874
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:34,997
( panting )

875
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,414
<i>DON'T TOUCH WHAT'S MINE!</i>

876
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,886
( gasps )

877
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,288
( panting )

878
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,923
( gasps )

879
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,089
( indistinct chatter )

880
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,821
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF HOSPITAL
ARE YOU RUNNING OVER THERE?

881
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,357
NO, FORGET IT.
NO, WE'LL FIND HIM OUR SELF.

882
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:44,226
WHAT HAPPENED?
Christy: HOWIE.

883
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,927
HE WAS IN MY HOUSE.
HE'S TRYING TO KILL ME.

884
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,529
WHO'S TRYING
TO KILL YOU, CHRISTY?

885
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:51,900
I FOUND MY DOG
AND IT WAS ON MY MIRROR
AND THE BARN.

886
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:53,435
WHAT BARN? WOULD YOU
PLEASE JUST SLOW DOWN,

887
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,203
START FROM THE BEGINNING,
AND TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

888
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:57,205
CHIEF. ( sighs )

889
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:58,840
WALKER ESCAPED.

890
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:00,208
GIVE US A SECOND, CHRISTY.

891
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,210
HOWIE--
PLEASE, JUST GIVE US A SECOND.

892
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,812
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ESCAPED?

893
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:06,181
I MEAN, GONE, SIR.

894
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,183
YOU FIND HIM,
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

895
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,185
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU CAN CAUSE?

896
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:12,320
YES, SIR.
THEN YOU FIND HIM... NOW.

897
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:13,889
YES, SIR.

898
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,961
ELLIOTT SMITHE IS MISSING, TOO.

899
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,296
SMITHE AND WALKER?

900
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,836
I DON'T KNOW
IF WE HAVE ANOTHER VICTIM
ON OUR HANDS HERE, ROB,

901
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,040
OR IF THEY'RE
WORKING AS A TEAM.

902
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,180
( sighs )

903
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,110
Boy: <i>STOP IT! LET GO!</i>

904
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,488
STOP IT, ELLIOTT!
LET ME GO!

905
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,457
LET GO?
YOU WANT ME TO LET GO?

906
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:58,059
ELLIOTT, KNOCK IT OFF!

907
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,061
Woman:

01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,352
MOM! DAD! STOP IT!

915
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,222
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

916
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:31,993
DON'T TOUCH WHAT'S MINE!
I WON'T! I PROMISE!
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

917
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:34,062

( crickets chirping )

01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,446
( engine starts )

937
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,153
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS SOONER?

938
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:14,255
BECAUSE ANGELA AND I
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

939
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,791
WE COME RUNNING IN,
CHARLIE'S JUST LYING THERE.

940
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:19,594
ELLIOTT AND KYLE WERE BOTH
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

941
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,330
WE THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

942
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,599
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE NOW, LARRY?

943
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,401
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

944
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,807
UH, STILL NO SIGN OF 'EM, SIR.

945
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,410
BUT, UM,
FORENSICS WANTS TO KNOW

946
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:38,680
IF YOU WANNA DO AN AUTOPSY
ON THE MARINER GIRL.

947
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,715
MINDY MARINER?
ELLIOTT'S GIRLFRIEND?

948
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,818
TELL THEM TO GO AHEAD.

949
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,821
LARRY, LISTEN,
I WANT YOU TO GO HOME
AND I WANT YOU TO WAIT THERE.

950
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,557
IF ELLIOTT SHOWS UP,
YOU CONTACT ME DIRECTLY.

951
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:51,292
YOU UNDERSTAND?

952
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,627
YEAH.

953
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,832
ROB, LISTEN, I NEED
EVERYBODY WE HAVE OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR THOSE KIDS.

954
01:08:57,834 --> 01:09:02,403
I DON'T WANT THEM
LEAVING OUR JURISDICTION.

955
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:21,256
( tires screech )

956
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,438
( gasps )

957
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,818
( grunting )

958
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,859
( groans )

959
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:03,231
ISN'T THIS PERFECT?
YOU AND ME, ALONE, HERE,
NOBODY ELSE AROUND?

960
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,769
WHERE'S KYLE?
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

961
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,371
ISN'T HE YOUR ACCOMPLICE
IN ALL THIS?

962
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,208
( grunts ) NO.

963
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,710
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT?

964
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,781
HE WAS WITH YOU
WHEN CHARLIE DIED.

965
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:24,552
( chuckles ) NICE.

966
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,555
YOU KNOW... ( grunts )

967
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,824
I KNEW THE LITTLE KID
IN MY DREAM LOOKED FAMILIAR,

968
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:32,293
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I HEARD
YOU HELPED KYLE ESCAPE

969
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,262
THAT I REALIZED WHO HE WAS.

970
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:37,432
I DIDN'T HELP.

971
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,635
WHY'D YOU KILL CHARLIE?

972
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:44,505
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

973
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:47,008
HE FELL.

974
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,679
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

975
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,548
DON'T YOU GET IT?

976
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:58,019
IT'S YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU.

977
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:04,892
IF KYLE'S THE KILLER,
YOU WON'T WANT HIM ANYMORE.

978
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:10,498
AND TURNER...
TURNER WAS A LUCKY BREAK

979
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,435
BECAUSE IF HE HAD WOKEN UP
AND BLABBED EVERYTHING, THEN...

980
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:18,439
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER,
CHARLIE...

981
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,875
MOM KEPT SAYING, "PLAY FAIR."

982
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,343
( grunts )

983
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:25,013
AND I TRIED.

984
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:27,615
BUT THE LITTLE BRAT...

985
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:31,019
WOULDN'T STOP
PLAYING WITH MY STUFF.

986
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,354
AND I HAD TO MAKE IT
CLEAR TO HIM

987
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:35,857
THAT NOBODY-- NOBODY--

988
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,860
MESSES WITH MY SHIT!

989
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:42,664
( whimpers )

990
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:54,475
HE WAS JUST A KID.

991
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,678
( chuckles )
SO WAS I.

992
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:01,416
BESIDES, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

993
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:02,684
( grunts )

994
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,952
SO WHY ERIC?

995
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,554
ERIC JACOBS?

996
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,756
IT WAS A SIMPLE TASK--

997
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:11,359
TO NOT TALK TO SOMEONE
WHO TURNS EVERYONE

998
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:14,395
AND EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES
INTO SHIT!

999
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:16,798
Eric: <i>HE NAILED ME WITH A D.W.I.</i>
<i>UNDERAGE DRINKING,</i>

1000
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,400
<i>AND THE BROKEN TAIL LIGHT.</i>

1001
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:23,905
<i>OFF THE HOCKEY TEAM</i>
<i>AND INTO A.A.</i>

1002
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,743
YOU KILLED HIM
BECAUSE HE TALKED TO KYLE?

1003
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:31,879
KYLE WALKER IS THE BAIN
OF MY FREAKING EXISTENCE.

1004
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,716
I SHOULD'VE KILLED HIM
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

1005
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,761
HEY, YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY CHANCE I'LL GET
BACK ON THE TEAM THIS SEASON?

1006
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,029
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

1007
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:52,400
WHAT'D YOU TELL THEM?
TELL WHO?
WHAT THE--

1008
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,802
WHAT?
I KNOW YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT ME! WHAT'D YOU SAY?!

1009
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:57,071
NOTHING!
DON'T LIE TO ME!

1010
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,539
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

1011
01:12:58,541 --> 01:12:59,874
( grunts )

1012
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,598
WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE SUICIDE,
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

1013
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,734
YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

1014
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:29,871
LINE? WHAT LINE?

1015
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:34,609
RED LINE! BLUE LINE!
GOLD LINE! SLAP SHOT!
OFF SIDES! I'M SICK OF IT!

1016
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:38,146
IS IT TOO DIFFICULT
TO FREAKING LISTEN, CHRISTY?!

1017
01:13:38,148 --> 01:13:41,682
NO. PLEASE, ENLIGHTEN ME.

1018
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:46,421
ELLIOTT, GREAT GAME.
HOLD UP A SECOND.

1019
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:49,857
WHAT WAS THAT IN THERE?
WHAT?

1020
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,531
HEY!

1021
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,637
( grunting )

1022
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,906
( groans )

1023
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:08,142
( grunting )

1024
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:11,212
( groaning )

1025
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,685
( groans )

1026
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:25,226
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
YOU HAVE TOTALLY LOST IT.

1027
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:26,861
( groans )

1028
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:28,863
( screams )

1029
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:33,968
( groaning )

1030
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:38,706
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU.

1031
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,480
WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY
IF I WENT AND SAW WALKER,

1032
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:47,748
LIKE, IN JAIL
AND I TOOK PICTURES OF HIM?

1033
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:51,052
WHY WOULD YOU WANNA GO DO
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT?

1034
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:54,055
OKAY, I WON'T.

1035
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:56,491
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING THAT. YOU KNOW IT.

1036
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:05,600
( gagging )

1037
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:33,594
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
BY KILLING MY BEST FRIEND

1038
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:36,597
THAT I'D SUDDENLY FALL
HEAD OVER HEALS FOR YOU?

1039
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:40,134
I PRACTICALLY
THREW MYSELF AT YOU.

1040
01:15:40,136 --> 01:15:44,605
I DON'T RECALL ANY ATTEMPT
OF YOU THROWING YOURSELF AT ME.

1041
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:47,141
WHY DO YOU THINK I ALWAYS
MADE SURE YOU WERE THERE

1042
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,977
EVERY TIME SHE AND I
WERE GETTING IT ON?

1043
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:51,612
( gun cocks )

1044
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,717
GO GET HELP.

1045
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,686
YEAH, CHRISTY, GO GET HELP.

1046
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,954
SHUT IT!

1047
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,222
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

1048
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,690
CHRISTY, PLEASE.
GO GET HELP.

1049
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:04,292
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

1050
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:08,262
IS THIS OUR YOUNG LOVERS'
FIRST QUARREL? ( chuckles )

1051
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,264
CHRIS,
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

1052
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:12,567
I CAN GIVE YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

1053
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,101
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING I WANT.

1054
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:17,572
NO? THIS LOSER'S
SO OBSESSED WITH YOU,

1055
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:20,174
HE KEEPS YOUR PICTURE
POSTED ALL OVER HIS WALLS.

1056
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:26,681
OH, YEAH?

1057
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,016
WHO'S THE ONE
WEARING MY CLOTHES?

1058
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:33,321
( chuckles )
IT'S A GOOD LIKENESS.

1059
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:38,292
WHAT MADE YOU LOSE IT?

1060
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,761
I AM COMPLETELY TOGETHER.

1061
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,763
OH, YEAH, CLEARLY.

1062
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,765
( grunting )

1063
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,834
( sirens wailing )

1064
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,807
KYLE!

1065
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,041
LET HER GO.

1066
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:56,110
( sirens wailing )

1067
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,717
YOU DON'T DESERVE HER.
PLEASE, JUST LET HER GO.
TAKE ME INSTEAD.

1068
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,653
I LET HER GO, YOU RUN,
YOU GET SHOT.

1069
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:07,722
( sirens wailing )

1070
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,794
SEE, WHAT YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND IS YOU HAVE NOTHING.

1071
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,630
THEREFORE, YOU ARE NOTHING!

1072
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:16,998
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1073
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,933
SHUT UP!

1074
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:21,002
( sirens wailing )

1075
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,675
COVER THE BACK.

1076
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:32,046
( grunting )

1077
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:35,750
ELLIOTT SMITHE! DROP THE GUN!

1078
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,354
PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!

1079
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,356
NO!

1080
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:45,826
KYLE! NO!

1081
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,965
( indistinct
radio transmission )

1082
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,700
GET ME AN AMBULANCE.
Man: YES, SIR.

1083
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:53,968
CHRIS, CHECK THE BACK!

1084
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,302
Man: GO! GO!

1085
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,419
( sirens wailing )

1086
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,846
( indistinct
radio transmission )

1087
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,993
YOUR VITAL SIGNS
ALL LOOK GOOD AT THIS TIME.

1088
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:55,463
BUT IF YOU HAVE
ANY SYMPTOMS THAT REOCCUR,

1089
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:57,164
DON'T HESITATE TO CALL US BACK
OR TAKE YOURSELF DOWN
TO THE HOSPITAL.

1090
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,333
THANK YOU.

1091

MR. WALKER...

1093
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:16,817
NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE TO STEAL
A POLICE OFFICER'S WEAPON...

1094
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:23,858
YOU MAKE SURE YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO BE WEARING ONE
OF OUR UNIFORMS.

1095
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,326
THANK YOU, SIR.

1096
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,530

IT'S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING.

1103
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:31,392
KYLE, YOU REALLY
DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1104
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:34,161
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT IT,
I COULD USE THE EXTRA MONEY
FOR ART SCHOOL.

1105
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:37,865
