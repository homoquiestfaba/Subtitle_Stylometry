1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,602
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

2
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:15,605
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

3
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:19,768
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

4
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:23,676
I got soul, but I'm not a soldier

5
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,183
Yeah, you know
you got to help me out

6
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:06,486
Yeah, don't you put me
on the backburner

7
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:10,962
you know you got
to help me out, yeah, yeah

8
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,328
You're going to bring us all down

9
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,889
Yeah, yeah

10
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,458
You're going to bring us all down

11
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,163
Yeah, yeah

12
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:22,799
Don't you put me on the backburner

13
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:27,039
You're going to bring us all down,
yeah, yeah

14
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,546
You're going to bring us all down

15
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:33,574
Oh, oh, and then

16
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:37,588
Last call for sin

17
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:39,521
While everyone's lost

18
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,617
The battle is won

19
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,323
With all these things that I done

20
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,905
All these things that I've done

21
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,074
If you can't hold on

22
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:07,251
If you can't hold on

23
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,121
My face haunted his dreams.

24
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:31,628
For billions of years,
the daily cycles of the ocean tides

25
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:37,142
have influenced patterns of hunting,
breeding, and feeding behavior

26
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,871
among the developing
life forms of our planet.

27
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,655
The city is filled
with excitement and anticipation

28
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:53,886
as the hangar doors are
scheduled to open at any moment,

29
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,393
giving Southland residents
their first glimpse

30
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,191
at the Treer MegaZeppelin.

31
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:01,255
The Jenny Von Westphalen
is 900 feet long,

32
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:05,326
is lifted by turbine engines
that are activated by an energy field

33
00:04:05,404 --> 00:04:07,133
that they call Fluid Karma.

34
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,651
Hi, Krysta.

35
00:04:21,954 --> 00:04:22,978
Zora.

36
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,079
Come on in.

37
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,690
Penetrating.

38
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:37,866
It's just a suggestion.

39
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,967
So what do you want?

40
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,804
We're filming my reality webcast
before the party.

41
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,037
Can I score some drugs?

42
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,408
Sure you can, kitten.

43
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,521
Pandora's box had been
left exposed to prying eyes.

44
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:19,305
How did you get this?

45
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,506
Hey, over here.

46
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,144
What's with the getup?

47
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,814
I've got the tape
of me and Boxer in my bag.

48
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,379
And what are you going to do with it?

49
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,251
I'm thinking of going public with it.

50
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,296
I mean, fuck it, this could impact
the entire election.

51
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:40,854
There's a website
that everyone's talking about.

52
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,798
Someone's routing
outside of USIDent,

53
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,268
and the government
cannot figure out how to shut it out.

54
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:46,326
What's it called?

55
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:50,569
Www.usideath.org.

56
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,111
How do I get this to the webmaster?

57
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:56,443
Oh, it's the Neo-Marxists. They've
put drop boxes all over the city.

58
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:58,346
I think there's one in the poopdeck.

59
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,113
Okay, get Sheena and Deena

60
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,017
and meet them in Hermosa
with the cameras.

61
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:04,077
Let's do this.

62
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,626
Pilot Abilene is accused
of being a part of a group of soldiers

63
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:11,424
who have smuggled
the drug out of Utopia Three.

64
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,828
War widow Tanya McBride

65
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:15,799
is set to speak at megachurch
gathering downtown.

66
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:19,065
Hermosa Police issue
an arrest warrant for Tab Taverner.

67
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:23,040
The former mayor remains at large,
hidden by Neo-Marxists underground.

68
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:26,669
UPU units prepare for violence
during downtown celebrations...

69
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:47,754
Give me the gun.

70
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,364
I need your help.

71
00:07:01,113 --> 00:07:02,842
I need you to help me
find my brother.

72
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:07,741
Okay.

73
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:16,521
Put on your seatbelt.

74
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:26,531
Well, Deep Throat Two,
I presume.

75
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,282
It's the only copy?

76
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,549
I don't work in distribution.

77
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,921
Yes, that's the only copy.

78
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,927
Oh, please, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

79
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:54,129
Go ahead, ask away.

80
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,996
How do you sleep at night?

81
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:59,266
Very well, thank you very much.

82
00:07:59,338 --> 00:08:01,772
That is, until I hear
screams from next door

83
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,536
because USIDent
is raiding my neighbor's house,

84
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,202
based on false information

85
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,008
provided by that Orwellian nightmare
your friend endorsed.

86
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:12,380
You ever lose someone close to you,
a loved one, in a terrorist attack?

87
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,440
'Cause I have.

88
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,687
This may come as a shock to you,
Mr. Smallhouse,

89
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:21,351
but I lost two people in Abilene--

90
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,690
two of my four ex-husbands,
on a fishing trip,

91
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,889
which they took every year
to bitch about me.

92
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,862
What are you going to do
with all that free money?

93
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,169
I'm going to distribute
my documentary film,

94
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,074
help some women in the Middle East
get some more civil liberties.

95
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,473
Do you know
what those two words mean?

96
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,207
"Civil liberties"?

97
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,611
You ought to write them down.

98
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:49,176
You know what? You're going
to go down, Cyndi Pinziki.

99
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,448
That's right,
I know your real name.

100
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,558
You know,
I wasn't going to do this,

101
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:59,654
but I feel very generous today.

102
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,495
I'm going to leave you
with a little present.

103
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:07,834
Wow. I am flattered.
What is it?

104
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:10,136
- A Taser gun to the balls.
- What?

105
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,473
You should know that
there's another tape out there,

106
00:09:15,547 --> 00:09:18,948
a far more incriminating tape
featuring your pal,

107
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,541
Boxer Santaros,
and a double murder,

108
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,644
and it's going to cost
a lot more than a million

109
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:25,053
to get your hands on that one,

110
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:27,387
because when
all is said and done,

111
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,428
nobody rocks the cock
like Cyndi Pinziki.

112
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:42,603
Eat shit, you fucker!

113
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:45,006
Whoa, yeah!

114
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,048
That little bitch, she stole it.

115
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:02,115
What?

116
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,219
Your friend Krysta.

117
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,821
She stole the tape
for her stupid reality show.

118
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,957
She's going to go
pranked on with it.

119
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:13,260
She probably thinks
it's the footage of her and---what?

120
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,704
Oh, eat a dick, Pinziki,
eat a dick!

121
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:17,731
What?

122
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,936
She just told me to eat a dick.

123
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,912
She's going completely fucking off.

124
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,578
You think your personal privacy
is more important

125
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,444
than protecting
my family from terrorists?

126
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:58,778
Well, guess again.

127
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,683
If the government
won't stop them, I will.

128
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:07,053
Vote no on Proposition 69.

129
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,357
President Bush
was received warmly

130
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,331
by a group of Orange County
Republican business leaders.

131
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,388
We've made it such

132
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,163
that an underground industry
thrives on human beings.

133
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:20,636
One question that the president
did not address

134
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:23,139
was the rising gas prices
starting to threaten

135
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,870
the GDP of the California economy.

136
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,980
Several small earthquakes

137
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:38,181
have been reported
off the coast of Santa Monica,

138
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:39,883
each increasing in magnitude.

139
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,518
Seismologists
are warning Southland residents

140
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,255
of another massive earthquake,

141
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,456
noting tidal disturbances
emanating

142
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,591
from the Utopia Three facility
on the Pacific coast.

143
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,135
I felt a premonition.

144
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:55,599
Danger was on the horizon.

145
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:22,892
Man, this is great.

146
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,233
Shit, Boxer Santaros.

147
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,168
Jericho Kane.

148
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,145
The information that I've uncovered
could get me killed,

149
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,773
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

150
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,113
The fate of the world
depends on you, Jericho.

151
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,854
Yes.

152
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,982
You must board the MegaZeppelin.

153
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:51,392
The secret you are looking for is
hidden in the Baron's private chamber.

154
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,658
What is the secret?

155
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,724
There's a dead body
they've retrieved from the desert.

156
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,634
They found the body in your car.

157
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:08,339
Did I kill someone out there?

158
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,739
They're listening.

159
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:15,445
They're watching.

160
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:22,023
If you should succeed,
remember me, my love.

161
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,084
Remember my name.

162
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,623
I will.

163
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:29,856
L--

164
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,962
I want to suck your dick.

165
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:43,171
If you don't let me suck your dick,
I'm going to kill myself.

166
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,952
W-w--wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

167
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:53,723
Target locked.

168
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:58,126
Take your pants off right now,
or I'm going to pull the trigger.

169
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,071
Take them off.

170
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,835
Okay.

171
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:13,772
Jericho Kane...

172
00:14:15,213 --> 00:14:17,181
is going to make your wish
come true...

173
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:20,108
and turn you into a new woman.

174
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,654
We could rent a room at Shutters.
It's my favorite place.

175
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:49,675
All right, we are trailing
Zora Charmichaels and Bart Bookman.

176
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,977
They are driving a silver pickup truck

177
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,041
looking to rendezvous
with Krysta Kapowski,

178
00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:01,991
a.k.a. Krysta Now,
blonde, 5'4", 110 pounds.

179
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,186
Apparently there is
a tape in her possession.

180
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,492
That is the target.

181
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,517
There's here car.
Bitch.

182
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,919
All right, now it's on.
Let's go.

183
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:34,787
God, this is
so revolutionary, Krysta.

184
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:35,848
We have a Steadicam.

185
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:38,520
I know, but when I said Steadicam,
I didn't at My First Steadicam.

186
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:40,689
I want a real one,
like a real movie.

187
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:43,962
I mean, TV show,
but it's like a movie.

188
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:47,232
You know,
these kind of new technologies

189
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:49,330
are totally changing culture now.

190
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,035
Yeah, especially now
that everything is digital.

191
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,542
That sausage makes me hungry.

192
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:08,721
Right down there, to the right,
behind the toilet, feed the hole.

193
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,928
Oh, yeah.

194
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,994
- Do you see this scene?
- Yeah.

195
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,404
- It feels good.
- It's hot.

196
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,532
Sir, those people
are trying to kill me.

197
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:56,397
Whoa.

198
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,206
Get the fuck out of my way,
you bitch.

199
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:02,267
Do you know who we are?

200
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,655
- What's your hurry, bitch?
- Oh, don't you--

201
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:22,328
Anybody else
want to take a swing at me?

202
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,960
Krysta, it's the wrong tape,
you stupid whore.

203
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,406
Come on and get me, fucks.

204
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:45,713
Fascist pigs.

205
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,828
Oh, my God!

206
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,527
Go, go!

207
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,668
Why did I buy this car?

208
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:02,763
Come on.

209
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,343
Grid nine zero two
six six...

210
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:18,277
- Hello?
- Fortunio.

211
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,016
- Hey, hey.
- Boxer.

212
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,217
I'm at 26th Street,
on The Strand, okay?

213
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,555
Okay, bye.

214
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:36,195
Fortunio was
on the Baron's payroll all along.

215
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:41,736
Put him up. Put him up.

216
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,538
His orders
were to deliver the specimen

217
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,544
to Treer Plaza before sundown.

218
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:55,576
Up, up, up.

219
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,810
Watch it.

220
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,128
There's no turning back now.

221
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:07,663
You're a good friend.

222
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:11,863
Cyndi had obtained a ticket

223
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:14,427
to the launch
of the Jenny Von Westphalen.

224
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,405
Unfortunately,
she did not have a plus one.

225
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,175
Darkness fell upon the city.

226
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,822
Neo-Marxist cells
began to converge upon downtown.

227
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,390
Treer Corporation would like
to thank the mayor,

228
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,434
the City of Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce,

229
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:47,436
and all the sponsors
who have supported the launch.

230
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,530
All proceeds will benefit
the victims' families...

231
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,769
The Eliot campaign
will celebrate the holiday

232
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:56,904
with a memorial concert
at the Taper Center.

233
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,176
Eliot will attend
the concert with his family,

234
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:02,275
while Senator Frost will attend
the launch of the Treer MegaZeppelin

235
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:04,821
just several blocks away.

236
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,792
Paranoia
began to consume their lives.

237
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:15,324
Thousands gather
to witness the maiden voyage

238
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,132
of America's technological marvel,
the Southland's newest wonder,

239
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:23,833
the Treer MegaZeppelin.

240
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,398
...the hills above Los Angeles today,
while on the ground

241
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:29,913
authorities are bracing
for the first riots since 1992.

242
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,973
You can see right there, a car bomb
went off just moments ago.

243
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:39,651
So why do you want to kill yourself?

244
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,959
I got drafted, dog.

245
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,027
I got to go to Iraq,
maybe Syria.

246
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,200
I can't take that shit.

247
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:57,599
I'd rather put a bullet
in my head quick and painless.

248
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:00,937
Fallujah.

249
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,475
You were in Iraq?

250
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:11,143
Yo, how'd you get out, dog?

251
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,887
That's none of your business.

252
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:21,429
Just try and cross the border
into Mexico.

253
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:23,295
That's where
my brother and I are headed.

254
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:24,629
Yo, I don't have a visa, dog.

255
00:22:45,089 --> 00:22:47,717
You said something
while you were asleep.

256
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,294
"We saw the shadows
of the morning light...

257
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,374
"the shadows of the evening sun...

258
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:09,436
until the shadows
and the light were one."

259
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:15,650
What does that mean?

260
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,317
"Three days."

261
00:23:19,556 --> 00:23:21,217
The final three days.

262
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:25,592
It all ends tonight.

263
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,296
It's gonna be a hot time
in the city tonight.

264
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:37,236
Job well done, Miss Now.

265
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:40,941
Is he gonna be okay?

266
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:45,540
Well, as they say,
only time will tell.

267
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:03,360
What does this mean?

268
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,432
There is a path to end all suffering.

269
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,977
You should take it.

270
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:30,151
Behold the Eighth
Wonder of the World--

271
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,855
Treer MegaZeppelin!

272
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,660
Did you retrieve the DVD
from Deep Throat Two?

273
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,791
Affirmative, Cyndi.
I'm going to be going live

274
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:40,200
with three tales
from the Southland this evening.

275
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,465
How long will the website be active

276
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,235
before USIDent
can route in and shut it down?

277
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,436
Are you kidding me?
Who are you talking to?

278
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,411
Don't worry your
pretty little head over it.

279
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,710
You go enjoy the rest
of the party. I'm out.

280
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:58,278
To be honest...

281
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,981
we're just looking out
for the niggers.

282
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,687
This is my deal now...

283
00:25:07,698 --> 00:25:09,529
Santaros.

284
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:31,352
More than a hundred thousand
people have gathered

285
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:35,653
to be at the largest block party
in the history of Los Angeles.

286
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:46,669
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.

287
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:59,844
Farewell, one and only beloved.

288
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,509
I cannot write anymore,

289
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,610
or my head will be
all in a whirl, and...

290
00:26:06,757 --> 00:26:09,351
Adieu, adieu my sweetheart.

291
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:10,415
Jenny.

292
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:22,928
You try so hard to be heard

293
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:28,373
You try so hard to not hurt

294
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:34,281
I give you nothing to doubt,
and you doubt me

295
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:40,415
I'll give you all that I have,
but you don't see

296
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:46,326
Now I know
that my eyes must close here

297
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:52,631
Every word seems to feel
like you don't care

298
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:58,471
But I know that
you're so confused and afraid

299
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:04,447
I just want to be one true thing
that don't fade

300
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:10,248
I don't want to give up tomorrow

301
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,587
I just can't understand
why we're going on

302
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,185
Thank you.

303
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:40,945
I don't wanna be sad

304
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:46,979
I don't wanna be scared

305
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,819
I don't wanna be sad

306
00:27:55,198 --> 00:27:58,656
I don't wanna be scared

307
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:04,571
I don't wanna be sad

308
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:10,436
I don't wanna be scared

309
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:16,778
I don't wanna be sad

310
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:22,021
I don't wanna be scared

311
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,627
I don't wanna be sad

312
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,868
I don't wanna be scared

313
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:39,809
I don't' wanna be sad

314
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:46,314
I don't wanna be scared

315
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:51,282
Mr. Boxer Santaros
has arrived.

316
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,015
Excellent.

317
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,355
How does it end?

318
00:29:07,904 --> 00:29:09,201
A handshake.

319
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,541
I had a dream last night
that you died.

320
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,739
Mr. Santaros.

321
00:29:22,752 --> 00:29:25,653
Your presence
is requested in the Marx Suite.

322
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,882
Alone.

323
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,096
I'm not going to die.

324
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,800
...he was on fire.

325
00:30:17,874 --> 00:30:19,307
The surrounding stores,

326
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:22,971
you could see people running
in and out of the broken windows.

327
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:24,445
What is going on--

328
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,948
And there's another--
another explosion just took off

329
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:30,180
down--right down there
off of Third Street.

330
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:28,814
Revelation 22--

331
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:32,946
"Very soon now
shall I be with you again...

332
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:38,023
"bringing the reward
to be given to every man

333
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:40,652
according to what he deserves."

334
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:48,727
Mr. Santaros,
welcome to the Marx Suite.

335
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:52,501
Now, Simon says
lower your sidearm, please.

336
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,199
Are you just deaf
or willfully stupid?

337
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:59,303
I told you to lower
that fucking sidearm!

338
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,041
And there you go.

339
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:05,616
Well, come on in.

340
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,720
They're trying to rig the election.

341
00:32:13,794 --> 00:32:16,194
California is too close to call.

342
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:18,424
All--all right, sweetheart,
whatever you say.

343
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:22,468
Why isn't she here?

344
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,170
She won't leave her post.

345
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:28,106
It is time for a surgical strike.

346
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:38,183
I can smell you
from down the hall.

347
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,582
No. Not now, Dennis.

348
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:49,618
The Neo-Marxists
have infiltrated USIDent.

349
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,790
She has to leave there immediately.

350
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:53,891
It's okay. She has
everything under control.

351
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:55,936
We need to get her out of there.

352
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:59,404
There are thousands, probably
tens of thousands of protesters

353
00:32:59,473 --> 00:33:01,270
all up and down the street

354
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:03,936
and spreading out
into the surrounding arteries

355
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:05,945
coming in
toward the downtown area.

356
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:12,350
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Treer MegaZeppelin.

357
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:34,441
The project was called
Serpentine Dream Theory.

358
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:37,636
The Tidal Generator
within Utopia Three

359
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:41,203
has achieved
simulated perpetual motion.

360
00:33:41,282 --> 00:33:43,910
The impact of this achievement

361
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:47,317
has slowed the acceleration
of the planet to such a degree

362
00:33:47,388 --> 00:33:52,291
that certain environmental anomalies
have started to surface.

363
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:55,988
One of these anomalies,
discovered earlier this year,

364
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:58,964
was a rift in the fourth dimension.

365
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,331
A rift in the fabric of space-time...

366
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:04,299
half a kilometer wide.

367
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:08,141
Located on the outskirts
of Lake Mead.

368
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:16,145
Yes, Mr. Santaros.

369
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:20,175
Just like you imagined
in your screenplay.

370
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:22,919
And what did we do

371
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,788
once we discovered a rift
in the fourth dimension?

372
00:34:27,895 --> 00:34:29,795
We launched monkeys into it.

373
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,504
Only a human subject
could survive that jaunt.

374
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:43,639
The soul of a monkey

375
00:34:43,711 --> 00:34:46,043
can't survive
the dimensional threshold.

376
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:49,982
So we learned,

377
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,951
at which point the Baron decided

378
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:58,014
that the first human subject
to travel through the rift

379
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:01,118
would be a movie star.

380
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:02,753
Why me?

381
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,027
Your celebrity
and your political ties

382
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,059
proved an irresistible combination.

383
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,429
As the satellite photos show,

384
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:16,670
at approximately 10:51 a.m.--

385
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:21,078
and this is 69 minutes
before you passed through the rift--

386
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:24,117
a duplicate Boxer Santaros
appeared.

387
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:29,781
You traveled 69 minutes
back in time, sir,

388
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,587
at which point your future self...

389
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:38,126
and your past self
confronted one another.

390
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:43,560
So I'm my future self.

391
00:35:45,205 --> 00:35:47,537
And I'm the dude
who traveled through the rift.

392
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:53,275
And this is all that's left
of your past self.

393
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,320
This body, this artifact,

394
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:09,761
this dual existence
of a single human soul

395
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,994
could unlock the secret of creation,
the secret of humankind.

396
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:19,667
I don't understand.

397
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,404
I've never considered
committing suicide.

398
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:32,714
I'm a pimp.

399
00:36:34,855 --> 00:36:38,018
And pimps don't commit suicide.

400
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,790
We don't know what would happen
if two identical human souls

401
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:47,390
and the vessels that they travel in

402
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:51,632
were to come into immediate
close contact with one another.

403
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:57,771
Indy 103.1--the independent FM.
Fourth of July weekend...

404
00:36:57,845 --> 00:36:59,437
Where did you get this?

405
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:02,938
Pilot Abilene.

406
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:04,675
Pilot Abilene?

407
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:08,078
Do you bleed?

408
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:23,867
You can fly so bloody

409
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:27,873
What happened
in Fallujah was an accident.

410
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:30,273
They called it friendly fire,

411
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,676
and Private Taverner
could not forgive himself

412
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:34,236
for what he had done to me.

413
00:37:34,314 --> 00:37:35,975
Yo, dog, where are we headed?

414
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:38,818
Somewhere downtown.

415
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:42,349
We have to go downtown.

416
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:47,323
He's in an ice cream truck.

417
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:51,729
Wow, I can feel it.

418
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:58,303
There is automatic weapon fire,
we understand,

419
00:37:58,372 --> 00:38:00,397
down on the ground,
and we just heard...

420
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:05,339
...the power and the kingdom
of your God...

421
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:15,085
Yo, dog, I'm going
to empty out my account...

422
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:17,647
take everything I got.

423
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:21,488
Neat.

424
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:24,429
Welcome
to the Rove Credit Union.

425
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,464
Please have
your USIDent card ready

426
00:38:28,535 --> 00:38:30,526
in order to make your transaction.

427
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:34,798
...is the promise
in the Word of God!

428
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:42,442
Welcome,
Martin Kefauver, welcome.

429
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:45,747
Martin Kefauver,
welcome, welcome, welcome...

430
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:48,379
Kefauver and card ready...

431
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,423
Yo, dog, it says--it says
"transaction denied," dog.

432
00:38:54,428 --> 00:38:56,623
Yo, what--what do I do?

433
00:38:57,931 --> 00:39:00,695
We're going to take
the ATM machine with us to Mexico.

434
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,704
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise for the national anthem.

435
00:39:09,776 --> 00:39:13,405
I give you Rebekah Del Rio.

436
00:39:56,556 --> 00:40:01,619
...whose broad stripes
and bright stars

437
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:07,691
Through the perilous fight

438
00:40:07,768 --> 00:40:18,667
O'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming

439
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:24,513
And the rockets’ red glare

440
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:30,147
The bombs bursting in air

441
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:34,990
Gave proof through the night

442
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:41,532
That our flag was still there

443
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:49,940
Oh, say, does that
star-spangled banner

444
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,572
Yet wave?

445
00:40:54,648 --> 00:41:03,420
O'er the land of the free

446
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:20,094
And the home of the brave

447
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,161
We've got a perimeter breach
at Caltrans Building.

448
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:44,993
I repeat,
we've got a perimeter breach.

449
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:46,464
Die, you fucking pig!

450
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:51,126
Uh-oh, wait.

451
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:53,798
Apparently we've lost
contact with Sky Cam.

452
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:55,967
As you could see
just before we lost the picture,

453
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:58,169
a lot of people downtown,
a lot of activity,

454
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:59,234
all kinds of problems.

455
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:01,473
- Please stay indoors.
- Stay inside.

456
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:05,348
And, you know, we're getting
information that the Neo-Marxist...

457
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:39,340
You know.

458
00:42:45,192 --> 00:42:48,787
You know exactly what happened
out in the desert.

459
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,325
Who did the Baron hire
to kidnap me?

460
00:42:57,337 --> 00:43:00,067
And who drove me
through the time rift?

461
00:43:08,515 --> 00:43:10,881
You haven't figured that out yet?

462
00:43:10,951 --> 00:43:13,351
What is his name?

463
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:18,389
Officer Roland Taverner.

464
00:43:26,566 --> 00:43:30,900
Officer Roland Taverner.
How are you?

465
00:43:52,158 --> 00:43:53,386
Ice cream truck.

466
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:05,699
Teri?

467
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,506
Teri, you've gone too far.

468
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,574
Ladies and gentlemen,
we seem to be having...

469
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:19,641
Is he still alive?

470
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:26,617
In more ways than one.

471
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:39,296
You made sure Taverner
went through the time rift with me.

472
00:44:40,307 --> 00:44:45,108
Then you hit the SUV
self-destruct trigger, by remote,

473
00:44:45,178 --> 00:44:46,702
which means...

474
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:51,741
I didn't kill myself.

475
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:57,612
You're a pimp.

476
00:44:58,692 --> 00:45:01,593
Pimps don't commit suicide.

477
00:45:01,661 --> 00:45:03,026
Oh, you got that right.

478
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,488
And Roland Taverner...
and his twin brother...

479
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:11,436
they're the same person,
aren't they?

480
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:20,138
Two identical souls
walking the face of the earth,

481
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:23,649
coexisting in the same
dominion of chaos.

482
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,054
What will happen
if they shake hands?

483
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:44,302
The fourth dimension
will collapse upon itself.

484
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,239
You stupid bitch.

485
00:45:54,681 --> 00:45:57,241
Again, don't be alarmed,
but stay inside.

486
00:46:03,723 --> 00:46:05,486
The ocean is in control.

487
00:46:06,593 --> 00:46:09,960
...the rioting continues downtown,
and it's a problem right now

488
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,294
because it looks like
the crowds are growing.

489
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:14,959
Even though we no longer
have contact with our chopper,

490
00:46:15,035 --> 00:46:17,299
we do understand it was
the Neo-Marxist movement

491
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,701
that started these riots.

492
00:46:18,772 --> 00:46:22,538
They're continuing to move
throughout downtown Los Angeles...

493
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:25,544
And this is the tower of fire.

494
00:46:27,013 --> 00:46:28,844
We have to evacuate.

495
00:46:28,915 --> 00:46:30,906
What in God's name
are you talking about?

496
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:43,623
There he is. Let's go.

497
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:49,400
We've got automatic weapons fire
at Fourth Street and Hill.

498
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:51,096
I think they're already inside.

499
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:53,435
Recommend open fire
into the crowd.

500
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,131
No.

501
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:39,178
Run!

502
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:47,827
Yo, yo, dog, you all right?

503
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:52,220
Well done, soldier.

504
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:07,980
Take that target.

505
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:11,441
You can't miss.

506
00:48:29,636 --> 00:48:31,467
Come on, let's go, let's go!

507
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:38,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Krysta Now,

508
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:43,179
Shoshanna Cox,
Sheena Gee, and Deena Score.

509
00:48:43,249 --> 00:48:47,686
They are
the Memory Gospel Dancers.

510
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:51,380
Let's-- let's leave right now.

511
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:53,448
This guy right here
might never leave.

512
00:51:34,854 --> 00:51:36,378
It had to be this way.

513
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:38,920
I know.

514
00:52:35,114 --> 00:52:36,604
He's going to die.

515
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,408
There's nothing
we can do about it?

516
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,480
Is it some kind of an orgy
or something?

517
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:44,784
What the hell's he doing?

518
00:53:11,517 --> 00:53:15,851
Evacuate the atrium.
Move to the rear of the MegaZeppelin.

519
00:53:15,922 --> 00:53:16,911
No.

520
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:20,356
Everybody, go back to your seats.

521
00:53:20,426 --> 00:53:22,951
Or I kill myself,
and I swear to God...

522
00:53:24,764 --> 00:53:25,958
I'll do it.

523
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,032
We have to let go.

524
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:35,832
I can't.

525
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:37,637
You have to let me go.

526
00:53:42,648 --> 00:53:44,980
But the truck will fall,
and we'll both die.

527
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,717
Let me go,
or I'll pull this fucking trigger!

528
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:51,018
- No, you won't.
- I swear to God I'll do it!

529
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,114
No, you won't.

530
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:21,918
Ladies and gentlemen,
the party is over.

531
00:54:21,988 --> 00:54:24,650
Have a nice apocalypse.

532
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,894
Put down the gun.

533
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:38,096
This is all in my head.

534
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:41,572
I can pull the trigger now
and wake up.

535
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,041
This whole nightmare
will be over.

536
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,376
Our mission
is to destroy capitalism.

537
00:54:50,149 --> 00:54:52,117
Dethrone God.

538
00:54:53,286 --> 00:54:55,049
Officer Roland Taverner.

539
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:59,185
That's who you want.

540
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,190
Don't you remember, Ronald?

541
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,767
Do you remember Fallujah?

542
00:55:11,604 --> 00:55:13,037
I remember everything.

543
00:55:38,431 --> 00:55:42,765
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the way the world ends.

544
00:55:44,937 --> 00:55:47,872
Not with a whimper,
but with a bang.

545
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:55,073
But there is hope.

546
00:55:55,147 --> 00:56:00,244
In the end we can be reassured
by one undeniable truth.

547
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,948
Nobody rocks the cock
like Krysta Now.

548
00:56:06,492 --> 00:56:08,153
And I mean nobody.

549
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:12,862
I knew that son of a bitch was crazy.
Get me out of here.

550
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:24,596
It wasn't our fault.

551
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:29,969
It wasn't our fault.

552
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:34,640
Friendly fire.

553
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:37,539
I forgive you.

554
00:57:37,616 --> 00:57:39,777
Friendly fire.

555
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:41,581
- I forgive you.
- Friendly fire.

556
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:43,053
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

557
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:45,317
- Friendly fire.
- I forgive you.

558
00:57:47,193 --> 00:57:48,319
I forgive you.

559
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:51,590
I forgive you.

560
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:54,190
Revelation 21--

561
00:57:55,568 --> 00:57:58,537
And God wiped away
the tears from his eyes,

562
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:02,096
so the new messiah could see
out to the New Jerusalem.

563
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:06,102
His name was
Officer Roland Taverner

564
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:08,373
of Hermosa Beach, California...

565
00:58:11,517 --> 00:58:13,451
my best friend.

566
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:22,321
He is a pimp...

567
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:28,392
and pimps don't commit suicide.
