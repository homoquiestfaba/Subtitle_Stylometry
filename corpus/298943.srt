1
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:14,570
Hey, boy.

2
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:22,286
Hey, boy!

3
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,541
Come on, boy.

4
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:29,877
Hey!

5
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,005
Hey!

6
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,884
Hey, fella.

7
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,308
Whoo!
Whoo!

8
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,060
No more fucking finals!

9
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,063
Hey, don't do it!
Don't go to college.

10
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,108
It's a fucking scam.
It fucking sucks!

11
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,464
Bert, got any more smokes?
No.

12
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,115
Bert: So I'm fat. So what?
I hope she's not anorexic.

13
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,587
Put her there, sport!

14
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,592
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

15
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,804
Jesus!
God damn it, Dennis, no!

16
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,265
No, Dennis, no!

17
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,601
No, don't hit him
or anything.

18
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,228
Everybody knows not
to sit next to Dennis.

19
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,399
He'll give you tetanus.
Maybe you should make a sign.

20
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,902
There's a stream around back,
if you want to wash your hand.

21
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,945
I'll get you a towel.

22
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,830
Hey, pal,

23
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,544
do you think it's a smart idea
leaving your kid here

24
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,338
where he might be
a danger to people?

25
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,089
What are you saying exactly?

26
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,259
I'm just saying,
if such an incident

27
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,762
were to bring about a "lawsuit,"

28
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,516
you might be held liable.
Jeff, save it for law school.

29
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:42,611
Cute kid.

30
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,798
Hey.

31
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,553
What's your name?

32
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,887
Yeah!

33
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,140
Man: If you're interested
in really good glasswork,

34
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,560
it's cheap,
but it's an antique.

35
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
Some of those bottles
up there

36
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,814
are dated
before the Civil War.

37
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,858
And over there,
I used to have

38
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,901
in that empty space,
I used to have

39
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,821
some of the prettiest
Shirley Temple bottles I've ever seen.

40
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,700
And this woman came in here
with the palsy, the poor soul.

41
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,868
She thought
they were so cute,

42
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,036
and she reached for them
and knocked every one down

43
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,663
and broke them all
to damn pieces.

44
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,208
So I took her in the back and gave her
some coke and ammonia.

45
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,918
I thought she was
gonna have a spell.

46
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,087
We should get something
for your mom to say thanks.

47
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,714
How about some fox piss?

48
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,758
My mom would love fox piss.
Oh Lord, don't drop that.

49
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,218
If you do,
that's powerful stuff.

50
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,889
All the foxes around
would come down here.

51
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,474
You'd have friends
you'd never had before.

52
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,643
You all here for a vacation?

53
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,354
Jeff: Yeah, we're renting
a cabin for a week.

54
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,815
That's nice. And if you go
in the woods

55
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,527
be very careful.
Why, what's in the woods?

56
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,779
Tommy, get those kids
their sandwiches.

57
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,698
They're all wrapped up.

58
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,660
So, what's the fox urine for?
That's for foxes.

59
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,789
What's the rifle for?
That's for niggers.

60
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,629
Okay, let's see.
Let's give you those sandwiches now.

61
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,131
I think we're about ready
to get y'all out of here.

62
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,634
That's $56 even.
Okay.

63
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,677
Anything I can do
for you, friend?

64
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,596
No, I think that's

65
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,306
Thank you.

66
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,475
You all have
a good vacation now.

67
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,353
You too.
Come back and see me.

68
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,024
Thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day.

69
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,486
Jeff: Did that guy
just say, "nigger"?

70
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,446
Marcy: Yeah, you
don't have to repeat it.

71
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,739
You can call it the "n" word.

72
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,201
Hey.

73
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,413
Boy, you want to give me
one good reason

74
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,624
why you would steal
a Snickers bar.

75
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,752
The nougat?

76
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,676
Sorry, man.
My bad.

77
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,387
All right. Enjoy.

78
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,765
Thanks.

79
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,185
What?

80
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,813
Moron.

81
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,649
Jeff:
What's wrong with you, dude?

82
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,442
Bert: Sorry.

83
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,571
I should burn his fucking
store down, the racist fuck!

84
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,829
Marcy: All right, make a left.
Jeff: Here?

85
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,081
Marcy: Make a left.
Jeff: Where else am I gonna go?

86
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,751
Jeff: Oh, and then down here
Bert: Stop the car!

87
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,503
Stop, stop!

88
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,590
I left my Mott's apple juice
back at the store!

89
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,675
Women: Oh my God.
Come on!

90
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,594
Paul: No, we're not going back.
Come on!

91
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,138
Paul: I'm sure this river
is in the map, right?

92
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,347
Yes!

93
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,434
Paul: There's no way
that this is on the map.

94
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,311
Karen: It is on the map.
Do you want to look?

95
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,062
This map's for Cincinnati.

96
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,898
Karen: Shut up.

97
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,819
Jeff: Fine, fuck it.
We'll go this way.

98
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,855
Marcy:
Oh my gosh. Wow.

99
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,026
"Welcome, y'all.

100
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,861
Enjoy your vacation
from all of us

101
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,863
at Bunyan Mountain Getaways."

102
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,199
Oh my God, Jeff,
check it out.

103
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:01,703
It's so cutethis little room,
this little bed

104
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,456
Its view is so beautiful.

105
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,959
The view of the shrubs

106
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,212
and the bush
and the antlers.

107
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,506
It's gonna be so perfect.
We're here for a week,

108
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,049
and there's no one
to bother us.

109
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,759
Who's up for a dip?

110
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,889
We'rethey're

111
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,225
Yeah. Safe sex.

112
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,228
Eh, Paul?
Yeah?

113
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,483
Have fun.

114
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,912
It's kind of sweet,
you know?

115
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,081
They seem pretty in love.

116
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,500
Bert, what the hell is that?

117
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,253
Huh? I'm gonna go shoot
some squirrels.

118
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,423
Why would you want
to kill squirrels?

119
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,342
'Cause they're gay.
Don't be a fucking retard.

120
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,344
Kidding. I don't care if
they're gay or straight.

121
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,597
I'll kill them either way.
Will you be careful with that?

122
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,183
Would you relax, man?
It's a fucking BB gun. Relax.

123
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,437
Sorry.

124
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,149
So, Karen

125
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,984
how long have we
known each other?

126
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,320
Seventh grade, right?

127
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:17,571
Yeah.

128
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:22,576
I was thinking, we've known
each other for so long,

129
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,453
and even though we

130
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,790
Karen: That's hot!

131
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,086
And, even though we've
always been good friends,

132
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,214
we never actually

133
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,300
I've always thought
you were really cool.

134
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:41,637
Hey, race you to the raft.

135
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,527
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la ¢Ü

136
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:01,490
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la ¢Ü

137
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:03,742
Fuck!

138
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,827
Jeff: Oh my God!

139
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,126
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la ¢Ü

140
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,922
Oh, feels fucking great!

141
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,353
You like that?
Yeah!

142
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,857
Jeff: I'm sorry.
Oh yeah!

143
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,365
So you know Ken Webb?

144
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,367
Yeah.

145
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,411
Short, greasy Ken.

146
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,081
The guy with the CDs, right?

147
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:52,416
Yeah.

148
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,335
He tried to kiss me.

149
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,213
He did?
Yeah.

150
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,090
Two days ago.

151
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:02,176
This guy I've known
for 12 years,

152
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,094
he's a family friend.

153
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,346
He puts his hands
on my face,

154
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,559
full-on tongue!
It was so gross!

155
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:17,065
Why, was it gross because
you've known him for so long or

156
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,401
'cause he's gross?

157
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,070
No, it was definitely him.

158
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,118
I don't know. When you've known
someone a long time,

159
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,247
you just want to kiss them just
to see if they're a good kisser.

160
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,419
There's nothing wrong
with that, right?

161
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:50,432
No.

162
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,571
Where are you going?
What's it look like?

163
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:10,786
I thought we were kissing.
Yeah, we were.

164
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,372
So

165
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,210
so what, you like me now?
Is this like a date?

166
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,963
Don't be gay.

167
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,787
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.

168
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,832
I'm gonna get you now.

169
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,967
Oh shit.

170
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:11,096
Oh fuck.

171
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,851
I'm sorry, man.

172
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,731
What?

173
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,861
Why did you shoot me?
I thought you were something else.

174
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,697
I didn'tfuck!

175
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,158
Are you all right?
I'm s

176
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,367
sick.

177
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,995
I need help.
Oh man.

178
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,039
I'll get you
some help, all right?

179
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,124
I'll be right back.
I got a car.

180
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:40,876
Oh fuck.

181
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,046
Oh please, help me.

182
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,757
Fuck.
I'm sick. I need water.

183
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,509
Just lay down.
Don't move, man.

184
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,511
Water.
I'll get you water.

185
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,096
Just stay-
don't come near me, okay?

186
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,890
Is that your

187
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,934
is that your cabin?
No!

188
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,603
Just stay there!
Please, stay there.

189
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,730
Don't make me
fucking shoot you, man.

190
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,483
Just stay the fuck back,
please!

191
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,985
Fuck!

192
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,073
Fuck!

193
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,578
Fuck!

194
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,251
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?

195
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,044
You gonna burn the whole
fucking place down?

196
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,796
What are you,
Smoky the Clown now?

197
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,631
Don't you mean,
Smoky the Bear?

198
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:29,633
Whatever.
This is horseshit, man.

199
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:32,052
It's a fireplace.
How old are you?

200
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,221
Can't you be responsible
for anything?

201
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,890
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes

202
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,102
without you destroying something!
What were you shooting at?

203
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:43,146
I heard a squirrel.
I was just looking for a squirrel.

204
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,773
A squirrel?
Yeah.

205
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,901
Fucking idiot.
Jeff: To stick up his ass.

206
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,328
Jeff: Why don't you
tell us the story?

207
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,081
What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

208
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,583
Come on, Paul,
tell them story.

209
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,960
No, I can't.
It's a traumatic experience.

210
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't want to talk about it.
We like traumatic stories.

211
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,924
Not about me, but
Trauma bonds people.

212
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,677
You can tell us.
It bonds those who go through it,

213
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,680
not the people you tell it to.
Tell the fucking story!

214
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,515
All right!

215
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,518
So there's this bowling alley
when we were growing up.

216
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,646
You guys might remember it-
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl?

217
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,356
It was in Brighton, right?

218
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,067
That's probably why it was
called Brighton Bowl.

219
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,362
We used to go there
for birthday parties

220
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,907
or with my dad
for the weekend.

221
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,660
This one time, I asked
my dad if we could go.

222
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,331
He's like, "No.
The bowling alley's closed."

223
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,833
This marshmallow's so burnt!

224
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,546
It turned out there had
been a break-in.

225
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,216
All the employees
were held at gunpoint.

226
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,636
After they had been
gagged and beaten,

227
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,680
they were tied to chairs.

228
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,145
The chairs
they were set in a circle,

229
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,232
so that way everybody
was forced to watch

230
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,275
everybody else.

231
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,362
And then the robber,

232
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,864
this sick maniac,

233
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,701
he goes and finds one of those
little ball-peen hammers.

234
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,745
And then one by one

235
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:25,374
he smashed the backs
of their heads open with the hammer.

236
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,960
Everyone had to watch
their friends die,

237
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,838
knowing that they'd
soon be next.

238
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,258
Ball-peen

239
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,969
The guy doesn't stop there.

240
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,388
He breaks out the fire axe.

241
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,391
The alarm goes off
he doesn't give a shit.

242
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,603
He hacked off
all of their limbs.

243
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,648
The cops found six
bloody torsos

244
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,900
tied to the bowling seats.

245
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,319
Blood everywhere

246
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,615
Turns out the guy was
some disgruntled employee.

247
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,411
That was
my childhood playground.

248
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,207
Bert, you asshole,
it's not funny.

249
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,168
Yes it is,
you fucking slut.

250
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,335
Jeff?

251
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:11,753
What?

252
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,089
Tell them about
the happy bald guy.

253
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,676
No, I can't take it.
He gave us our shoes

254
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,928
and quarters for
the video games.

255
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,930
There was a room with
a pool table,

256
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,974
but my dad wouldn't
let us go there.

257
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:27,436
The bald guy was always happy,
always smiling.

258
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,606
But the killer
got him too.

259
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,648
When the cops searched
the place,

260
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,819
they found hacked off limbs
at the end of the bowling lanes.

261
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,947
The guy had bowled
people's organs.

262
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,490
Arms, legs, everything.

263
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,621
They found the bald guy's head
in the ball return.

264
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,001
He was still smiling.
Oh, no.

265
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,629
I knew you were full of shit!
You suck!

266
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,299
No! It was in the paper.
I swear!

267
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,801
I'm laughing because

268
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,262
Jeff is an asshole
and he's making me laugh.

269
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:03,514
I swear

270
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,642
I loved this place.
I still remember the sounds

271
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,810
the cracking,
the bouncing.

272
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,648
The smell of the shoes,
the sound of the Q-Bert machine

273
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,942
Holy shit!
What are you doing?!

274
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,361
I'm cool.
Are you spying on us?

275
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,696
I'm cool.
Is your dog friendly?

276
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,782
Yeah, he's cool.

277
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,784
This is Dr. Mambo.
Here, boy.

278
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,494
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

279
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,664
Is it "Dr." like a physician
or a professor?

280
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,124
Yeah, he's a professor

281
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,878
of being a dog.
Oof! Faced!

282
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,926
Scratch-moded.

283
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,311
It's a positive bonfire.

284
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,772
Got room for one more?

285
00:21:56,692 --> 00:22:00,821
Actually, we were having a private
conversation, if you don't mind.

286
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,740
That's cool.

287
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,285
I guess I'll smoke
all this weed by myself.

288
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,704
All: No, no.
It's fine.

289
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,873
It's not that private.

290
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,959
Awesome.

291
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,713
Yeah, sit right here.

292
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,798
Bert: I think he's gonna
fuck her.

293
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,758
Guy: Awesome.

294
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,302
Wait, so your name was
Justin

295
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,805
but you can call me "Grim."
Grim.

296
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:28,140
Like Grimace?

297
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,475
"Grim" is my skating name.

298
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,604
I got it in Berkeley while
competing in the X-Games.

299
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,648
Really? Karen's going
to go to Berkeley.

300
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:38,150
Dude

301
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:40,110
awesome.

302
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,989
I love Berkeley.
People there are so wacked.

303
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:47,951
I met these guys and they had me
fucked up for five days straight.

304
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:50,412
They wouldn't let me drink
anything but beer.

305
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:54,082
Yeah, I've done that,
except I did it with JD.

306
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,250
Karen's got a great idea.

307
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,107
We should only drink beer
for the rest of the trip.

308
00:22:58,108 --> 00:23:00,923
I could probably do that,
but I doubt you could.

309
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:04,593
I'll bet you. I can only drink
beer the rest of the trip.

310
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:07,804
If I drink anything else,
you can have the rest of my supply.

311
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,224
All right, you're on.
We only drink beer.

312
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,683
Bert: You're on.

313
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,354
So, you're a skater?
Is that your occupation?

314
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:18,482
Oh, crap.

315
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,776
Party's over.

316
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,613
Hey Justin
Grim

317
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:26,615
you want to come inside?

318
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,701
I'd love to, but I left
all this shit outside my tent.

319
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,620
It's starting to rain,
if it gets fucked up,

320
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,622
it's like $4,000 worth
of shit pissed away.

321
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,123
How far away is your tent?

322
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,793
20 minutes away, but if I book
I can be back in 30.

323
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:41,129
Cool. Bring the weed.
I will.

324
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,674
Check you dudes later.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

325
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,972
Jeff: Freak.
Karen: I thought he was funny.

326
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,061
Bert:
How did it work?

327
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,939
What do you mean "how"?
It had a hose

328
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,149
a bunch of different settings,

329
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,652
pulse, power

330
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:05,195
stream.

331
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,490
And you came every time?

332
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:09,908
Totally.

333
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,704
You can imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

334
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,873
Tell me about it.

335
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,374
What's that supposed
to mean?

336
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,377
I've got a better story.
Paul: I'm sorry,

337
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,505
but no story is better
than Karen and the shower massage.

338
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,008
No, seriously.

339
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,178
One time I was masturbating

340
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,097
and my dog came up
and started licking my balls.

341
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,058
Right as I came it stuck
its tongue up my ass.

342
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,896
That's serious fucking
masturbation talent right there.

343
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,898
Fucking good.

344
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,278
He'd better have brought more weed
or I won't let him in.

345
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,488
Relax, pal.
I'm coming.

346
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,324
His name's Grim.

347
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,536
Jesus Christ.

348
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,127
Help me
please.

349
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,630
I need a doctor.

350
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,340
Oh shit.

351
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,842
Man: Doctor.

352
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,802
Yeah, all right.

353
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,388
Somebody grab a blanket
or something.

354
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,229
You

355
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,691
you shot me.

356
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,736
No, no, no.

357
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,322
There's no way this contagious
fucker's coming in here.

358
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,408
He's sick, for Christ's sake.
You want him to come in here

359
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:37,454
and touch all of your shit,
your fucking soap?

360
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:39,455
Let's throw him
a blanket or something.

361
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,542
Or your douche?
Let's drive him to a doctor.

362
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,418
He's not coming in!

363
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,546
We're out of range.
I'm not getting anything.

364
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,505
Fuck!

365
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,341
What's that?
He's in the car.

366
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,051
What?

367
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,637
Jeff: Motherfucker.

368
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,348
Karen: Why's he fucking with us?
Grab your gun.

369
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,182
Fuck!

370
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,852
Hurry up!
He's in the car already!

371
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,527
Get out of the fucking car!

372
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,196
Get out of there.
Get out of the car!

373
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,283
Get out!
Get out of the fucking car!

374
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:15,367
Fuck!

375
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,162
Get the fuck out!
Get out of there!

376
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,037
Fucker!

377
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,665
You shot the car!

378
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:23,834
What was I supposed to do?

379
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,961
Oh my God!

380
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,093
Fuck!

381
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,221
Paul: Shit!

382
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,350
Shit!

383
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,729
Oh!

384
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,983
Get him!
He's coming towards us.

385
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,278
Stop or I'll fucking
stab you!

386
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,238
Stop! Stop!

387
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:57,159
Back off.

388
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,871
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!

389
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,707
Fuck off!

390
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:18,013
I know. I know.

391
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,516
What else were we gonna do?

392
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,851
First he gets his shit
all over the car,

393
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:26,563
and I don't want him
touching me, you, or anybody.

394
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,774
I think the rain will
put him out.

395
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,735
He's dead anyway.
You saw that shit on him.

396
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,987
He looked like he was
skinned alive.

397
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:38,575
We have to tell the police
it wasn't our fault.

398
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:41,370
I think we should tell them now.

399
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,330
Calm down.

400
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,874
There's nothing we can do.
The car's fucked.

401
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,711
We need a mechanic. We'll find
somebody who knows one,

402
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,256
and then we'll report
the accident.

403
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,759
That's the keyword here.
It was an accident.

404
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:00,055
Paul: The guy's skin

405
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,057
holy shit.

406
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,662
You should clean up some
of this shit while we're gone.

407
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,748
I'll save some for you guys.

408
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,125
Just stick with the girls.
What's that supposed to mean?

409
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,753
It means you're
a fucking pussy.

410
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,296
That's fucked up.

411
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:17,382
What's fucked up is you beating
the shit out of my truck.

412
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,009
What about the jag-off
with the rifle?

413
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,219
Did you forget about him?

414
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,138
We all fucked up that car,
don't just put it on me.

415
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,765
Good morning, boys.

416
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,643
Are you going
to kill each other now?

417
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:29,853
Where are you going?

418
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,064
To get help.

419
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:17,025
So
Bert and Jeff are gone.

420
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,487
I know.

421
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,492
Last night was
a fucked up situation,

422
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,328
and I think
That guy asked for our help.

423
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:31,206
We lit him on fire.

424
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,961
Can you understand if I'm not
in a particularly social mood?

425
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,924
I got scared.

426
00:30:41,842 --> 00:30:42,342
I was

427
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,803
I was just trying to help.

428
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,766
Karen

429
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,146
I'm sorry, Paul.

430
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,610
Every time I close my eyes
I see him.

431
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,237
It was an accident.

432
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,907
The guy was going to die
anyway.

433
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:16,627
Better?

434
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,342
Yeah.

435
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,472
Thanks, Paul.

436
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,658
Jeff: Hello?

437
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,280
God damn it!

438
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,450
God damn it!
God damn it!

439
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:33,704
God damn it!

440
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,041
Hold it! You there!

441
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,253
Do you see this?!
Do you see this shit?!

442
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,005
We didn't see anything.

443
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:46,717
Tell Murray I can't eat this shit.
Some animal's been running around

444
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,510
infecting everything.

445
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,305
What am I supposed to do
with a sick hog? Huh?

446
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,308
I am not about to
eat that meat. Would you?

447
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:58,187
No, I'm a vegetarian.
None of this shit is good.

448
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,731
It's all sick.
It's all gotta go back.

449
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,774
I want me a new hog!

450
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:05,027
We were just looking
for a mechanic.

451
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:08,155
Mechanic?
You won't find one around here.

452
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,657
You'll have to go to town.
Bert: That's the thing.

453
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,535
Our car's busted,
so we can't get into town.

454
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,621
We need somebody to take
us into town

455
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,831
so we can find a mechanic.
Oh.

456
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,876
I've already been
in town today, sorry.

457
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:24,880
All right, if you do go back,
would you tell us?

458
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,050
We're staying at a cabin,
and

459
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,177
we don't know Murray.

460
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,931
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,725
Yes, of course,
of course.

462
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,686
Why didn't you
just come out and say that?

463
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,939
Come on inside,
I've got a radio.

464
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,191
We'll call Ricky.
He's got a tow truck.

465
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,984
Call Ricky.
Ricky.

466
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,071
Sorry to bother you, but this
crazy guy came out of the woods

467
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:51,740
and tried to trash
our car.

468
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,035
Woman: Sounds terrible.
I have some juice.

469
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:57,788
So this person damaged
your car?

470
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,083
It was just this crazy hermit.
Real dangerous.

471
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,586
We chased him away with bats.
It wasn't Henry, was it?

472
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:07,005
Nah, shit, never.

473
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:11,343
Henry?

474
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,931
My cousin Henry.
He knows about that ordinance.

475
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:18,976
He wouldn't do something like that.
You hit him with a bat?

476
00:34:19,852 --> 00:34:20,352
Both: No.

477
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,855
No, it wasn't Henry.

478
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:26,400
Our friend Walter, he got drunk.
One thing led to another

479
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,486
That's no good.
Yeah.

480
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,867
I've got a great idea. Why don't
we take a walk down ourselves?

481
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,494
It's really nice out.
We'll just walk.

482
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:41,248
I haven't seen the scenery.
You sure? Ricky's awfully handy.

483
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,500
Thanks for your help.
Are you sure?

484
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,752
A little fresh air
sounds great.

485
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:48,255
We really appreciate your help.
Take care.

486
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,426
We burned Henry.

487
00:34:53,177 --> 00:35:18,035
Fuck!

488
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:40,516
Hello?

489
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:58,492
Hello?

490
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:10,504
Hello?

491
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,310
Hello?

492
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,522
Hello?

493
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,067
Is anyone home?

494
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,617
Hello?

495
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,413
Ah!

496
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,708
Bert, you dick-nose.
Shut up.

497
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,295
What the hell?

498
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,422
Did you find anybody?
No, nothing.

499
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,757
I followed the path
that the old guy ran,

500
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,427
but I couldn't find him.
He could still be alive.

501
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,262
No, it's impossible.

502
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,892
Want any beef jerky?
No, put it away.

503
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,894
Why?
It's not our house.

504
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,188
So?

505
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:12,816
Did you find a phone?
No.

506
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:15,402
I felt weird looking around.
There's nobody here.

507
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:17,821
We found this other place,
but

508
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,781
there was
nobody there either.

509
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,992
I wonder if the cops
know about it yet.

510
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,036
I doubt it.
If they did know,

511
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:26,079
they'd have been
at the cabin by now.

512
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:39,051
Good morning.
Deputy Winston,

513
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,094
Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

514
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,224
Hi.
What can I do for you?

515
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:47,226
I'm on patrol
in my jurisdiction

516
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,020
and I heard there was a lot
of commotion here last night.

517
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,022
I wanted to know
what the story is.

518
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:55,526
Yeah, sure. Some guy tried
to break into our cabin.

519
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,694
And he was sick.

520
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:00,322
I don't know what kind
of disease he had,

521
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,491
but he was a mess.

522
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,618
I have to report this.

523
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,119
Yeah, totally.

524
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:09,540
My friends are out looking for
a neighbor so we could call you.

525
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,667
We don't have a phone here.

526
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,628
Everyone uses radios.
That's what I use.

527
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,714
Hey

528
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:23,178
Looks like you guys were doing
some pretty good partying, huh?

529
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,431
Yeah, you know,
we were drinking

530
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,433
and then this guy came along

531
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,894
and tried to break into
the cabin.

532
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:33,730
We had no choice
but to get rough.

533
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:36,692
I feel awful,
but he was going crazy.

534
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,735
He smashed into our car,

535
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,363
and then he wouldn't come out,
so

536
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:43,407
we had to hit him.

537
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,408
We hurt him.

538
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:47,786
We were terrified.
We didn't know what to do.

539
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,746
That's why we went
to look for help

540
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:53,041
Hey, man, I told you
I'm gonna make a report.

541
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,961
Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna come back.

542
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:58,505
Looks like you guys
scared him away pretty good.

543
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,716
I ain't gonna let him
ruin your fun.

544
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:02,509
Thank you.

545
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:06,013
My friend's inside right now
and she's pretty freaked out.

546
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,891
She wants to go home.

547
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,893
We all kind of do.

548
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,437
A lady friend, huh?

549
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,856
I bet you like to party

550
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:18,066
with the ladies.

551
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,196
Karen: Paul?

552
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,656
Is everything okay?

553
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:27,326
Howdy, ma'am.
Everything's fine.

554
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,078
Just go back inside,
have yourself a big 40,

555
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,997
just party.

556
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:33,457
Umm

557
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,836
okay.

558
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:43,592
Oh, Daddy, why are you
talking about leaving?

559
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,677
You've got to stay and party.

560
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,722
That's why we came here
in the first place.

561
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,726
I'm telling you,
this is a major party town.

562
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,728
Really?
Are you kidding me?

563
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:56,813
You know what it's like
when you go

564
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:58,815
to a new town
and you're the new guy?

565
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:01,610
All the girls see you
walking down the street

566
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,571
they don't know you've got
five pounds of dangling meat.

567
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,699
They're looking for
no commitment.

568
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:11,328
You understand what I'm saying?
I've heard that theory before.

569
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,330
This is that town.

570
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:16,542
It's like when I go party
up at Wambusau.

571
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,544
My cousin goes to school there.

572
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,256
When I party at Wambusau,
I know I'm gonna get pussy.

573
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,634
Plus the girls there don't know
I'm a deputy.

574
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:28,303
So I know they're gonna
party hard with me.

575
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:31,348
Believe me, man,
they do.

576
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,977
That's too bad, I bet you ruled
this town before you had a badge.

577
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,480
Yeah, but a badge
makes you grow up quick.

578
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:43,152
Shit, this guy went and did
a number on your ride.

579
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:46,071
I'm gonna put out an APB.
We're gonna catch this guy.

580
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:48,282
Yeah, it wasn't totally him.

581
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,992
We hit it too.

582
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,661
But we were trying
to scare him away.

583
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,038
Could you get somebody
up here to fix it?

584
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:58,167
What do I look like?
An idiot?

585
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,003
I'll have someone up here
by tomorrow afternoon.

586
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:03,964
You're top priority.
You're the party man.

587
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,633
Do you realize how many
great parties we're gonna have?

588
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,595
Fortune's shining on you.

589
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,513
I know where all
the big parties are at.

590
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,515
Remember, my name is Winston.

591
00:41:13,557 --> 00:41:15,767
You know how to
get a hold of me, right?

592
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,646
9-1-1?
That's it, my man.

593
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,733
Take it easy.
Yeah.

594
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,673
Did he say he was gonna
report this shit or not?

595
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:49,051
I think he is.
He didn't make it seem like

596
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:52,095
we did anything wrong. He said
he'd get a tow truck up here.

597
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:54,681
Sounds weird to me.
The guy was weird.

598
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:58,143
Once he saw Karen,
he didn't want to leave.

599
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,729
Has Karen left her room yet?

600
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:05,526
No, she's still sleeping.
I don't know what's up with her.

601
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,654
She wants to get out of here
as soon as she can.

602
00:42:08,737 --> 00:42:11,865
Puts a kink in your plan, huh?
What plan?

603
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,742
What plan?

604
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:16,537
The plan you've been trying
to execute

605
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,664
since eighth grade.

606
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,625
No, there's no plan.
Not anymore.

607
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,919
Whatever.
You guys are funny.

608
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,630
Fucking

609
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,842
she likes you because you're nice
to her and she's nice to you

610
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,885
because she can control you.

611
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,431
Fucking, you're nice to her
Bert, don't move.

612
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,104
Bert: Fuck.

613
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,439
It's that freak's dog.

614
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,735
Should I hit it?
I don't know.

615
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,946
If you're gonna hit it,
hit it hard.

616
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,919
So where's Grim?

617
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,672
He's out there rotting.
There's some sick shit

618
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:11,967
in the woods and the hermit's
spreading it around.

619
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:14,386
I'm not waiting for
that deputy to come back.

620
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,930
Let's get out of here now.
Should we say something

621
00:43:17,014 --> 00:43:20,350
on our way out, like, "By the way,
we burned some guy alive"?

622
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,351
Yes.
No.

623
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:23,687
Jeff.
Fine, we'll tell the cops.

624
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:26,315
We have to.
They're gonna figure it out.

625
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,359
The deputy knows something happened.
We're the only outsiders.

626
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,987
They're gonna trace it
back to us.

627
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,698
I feel nauseous.

628
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,034
Karen

629
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,330
How soon can you
get us out of here?

630
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,540
I don't know if
I can fix the car.

631
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:46,793
I'm thinking I could
make it drivable,

632
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,588
we could drive into town
and tell them what happened.

633
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,341
And that'll be that, right?

634
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,512
But you're gonna have
to watch me with the gun.

635
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:59,223
I'm not gonna go out there
with that fucking dog around.

636
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,309
I need a bath.

637
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,811
Jeff's mom has
the stupidest ideas

638
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,314
"Let's get a cabin."
So gay.

639
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,671
Hey.

640
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,090
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you.

641
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:35,634
That's okay.

642
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,264
I think Marcy made some chili.

643
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:43,392
I'm not hungry.

644
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,940
All right, then.
I'll let you go back to sleep.

645
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:51,316
No, wait.

646
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:54,069
Stay.

647
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:06,373
Fuck.

648
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,836
Why did you stop?
Would you shoot him already?

649
00:45:10,837 --> 00:45:12,838
Don't stop.
Keep working!

650
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,383
Shoot it!
If it gets closer, I can hit it.

651
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,677
Just keep working!

652
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:25,929
Oh my God!

653
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,017
Shit!

654
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,606
Marcy!

655
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,361
She's got it! She's sick.

656
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,405
Oh no, she's
fucking got it.

657
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,449
Oh shit.
I think I'm really sick.

658
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:48,326
Oh shit.
Stay in your fucking bed!

659
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,121
Bert, can you help me?
Calm down.

660
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:53,895
No! Get the fuck out!
Everybody out!

661
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:56,627
Just get the fuck out!
Bert, please!

662
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,795
Stay in your fucking bed!

663
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:00,964
I'm bleeding.
Get the fuck out!

664
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,467
Calm down!
Can I go to the bathroom?

665
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,719
Listen, you bitch!
Get the fuck in bed!

666
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,304
Leave her alone!

667
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,182
Leave her alone!
Fucking bitch!

668
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:13,268
What the fuck is your problem?
She's your fucking friend!

669
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,687
She's sick!
She's not coming near me!

670
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:18,482
I'm doing this for you
and all you fucks!

671
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,401
Don't leave me!
Stop it!

672
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,029
Bert, Bert calm down.
Oh God.

673
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,573
Okay.

674
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,078
What?

675
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:13,889
Fuck you, guys.

676
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,266
Karen, I'm sorry.
We just don't want to get it.

677
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,228
I'm going to die in here.
Paul: No, you're not.

678
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,397
Karen, please.
We're going to get help now.

679
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:25,651
What about that guy's dog?
Someone'll keep watch with the gun.

680
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,652
We'll bolt the door shut.

681
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:30,656
Somebody'll be out here.
We won't leave you alone.

682
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:35,160
I want to go home.

683
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,646
Ah!

684
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:05,274
Ah!

685
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,370
Karen?

686
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:22,207
Karen.

687
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,764
Come on, Karen,
you've got to eat.

688
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,239
Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

689
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,742
Okay?

690
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:00,370
Better close the door,
Marcy.

691
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,750
I don't want
to infect everyone.

692
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:05,269
Oh God.
What are you doing?

693
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,104
My friend
she's very sick.

694
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:09,898
You are very sick.
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

695
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,860
No, I'm-
That's my wife in there!

696
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:15,445
My friend's dying!
We need a phone, please.

697
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:17,990
Get the fuck off my property!

698
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:19,950
Shit!
Git!

699
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,168
Where have you been?

700
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,795
Did you find anyone?

701
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,549
Well, come on inside.
Marcy made chili.

702
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:42,097
Nobody's hungry?

703
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:48,896
What if Karen used those bowls?
Jesus! I washed them!

704
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:52,149
He's right. I'm not gonna eat
until we get back to town.

705
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,818
Jeff: You know, any
of you guys could have it.

706
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:58,238
I know we checked, but I'm
not gonna sleep near you guys.

707
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,908
So go sleep in the car
and give us all a break.

708
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,993
The car?
That thing's a germ factory!

709
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,038
I don't even want to ride in it!
Calm down. I cleaned it.

710
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,582
So why don't you sleep in it?
Maybe I will!

711
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:13,504
You're right. We should
prepare our own meals.

712
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:17,508
Who am I? I'm melting!

713
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:19,635
I'm burning!

714
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:21,345
What's your problem?

715
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,013
You're gonna
burn down this place!

716
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:24,306
What?
You asshole!

717
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,725
Fucking prick!
Marcy: Stop it!

718
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:28,352
Jeff!
Motherfucker!

719
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:34,024
Shut the fuck up!

720
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,568
Christ!

721
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,737
I can't take it anymore!

722
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,200
Just no more yelling.

723
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,119
We can eat alone,
we can sleep alone. Whatever.

724
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:50,207
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.

725
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:54,586
Bert, you just lost the bet.

726
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:01,844
Shit!

727
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:19,695
Okay, Karen, he's gone.

728
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:23,240
We're gonna stay out here
all night for you, all right?

729
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,326
Karen?

730
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:50,017
Fuck!

731
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:56,315
Come on, let's go, everybody.
Hurry up!

732
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,442
The Jeep's running.
Jeff, come on!

733
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:19,379
Come on, Karen.
We've got to go.

734
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,467
I think I've got a fever.

735
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,511
Let's go!

736
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,859
Come on, Jeff,
let's go!

737
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,610
Come on, motherfucker!

738
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:27,905
All right
put her in the back.

739
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:30,200
I don't think
we should sit next to her.

740
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,411
Fuck off!
Put her in the front, then.

741
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,746
No, I'm not driving
with her sitting next to me.

742
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:37,833
I'm driving.
Just get in the fucking car.

743
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,209
Fine.

744
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:43,172
Paul: Karen?

745
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,258
Karen, you okay?

746
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:52,598
Marcy: Oh God, Karen.

747
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,727
Marcy: We've got to get her
to town. She's gonna die.

748
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:57,936
Paul:
She's not going anywhere.

749
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,939
Come on.
You guys coming?

750
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:03,066
Are you nuts?
She just infected the car.

751
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:06,820
I'll take my chances, man.
I can't leave Karen.

752
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:11,074
Bert, you don't look so hot.
I don't feel so hot either.

753
00:58:11,116 --> 00:58:14,578
But the longer we sit here,
the more she lies and rots!

754
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,080
How sick are you?
Did that old guy touch you?

755
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,416
This is fucking horseshit!
Come on!

756
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,252
Did he?
Fuck this, man!

757
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:27,257
Bert: I'll get her
a fucking doctor.

758
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:29,635
Marcy: We should move her
back to the shed.

759
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:41,563
Oh God, she's bleeding again.

760
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,481
Don't move her.

761
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:46,485
It's okay, Karen.
We're gonna get help.

762
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:55,577
Going somewhere?
Anywhere but here.

763
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,880
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

764
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:07,965
Jeff?

765
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:09,842
Just let him go.
Jeff!

766
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:10,968
Jeff!

767
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,845
Don't fucking
come near me. Stop!

768
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:16,640
I don't want to get sick.
I don't want any of us getting sick!

769
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:18,809
But you two fuckers
insist on touching her!

770
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,019
Now she's bleeding
all over both you guys.

771
00:59:21,061 --> 00:59:23,480
So you two can fucking rot!
But not me!

772
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,732
No fucking way!
Not me!

773
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:29,444
Asshole!

774
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,880
Oh shit.

775
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:02,853
We're all going to get it.

776
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:05,939
We're all going
to get sick

777
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:08,317
and Jeff's in the woods
getting drunk.

778
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,073
Bert's going to get help.

779
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:19,495
Karen will be fine.
I promise.

780
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:21,705
It's like being on a plane

781
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,081
when you know
it's going to crash.

782
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:27,586
Everyone around you
is screaming and yelling,

783
01:00:27,628 --> 01:00:30,631
"We're going down!
We're going down!"

784
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:32,758
All you really want to do

785
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:37,304
is grab the person next to you
and fuck the shit out of them

786
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:40,307
'cause you know you're
gonna be dead soon anyway.

787
01:00:44,978 --> 01:00:48,565
You don't use condoms?
Don't worry. I'm healthy.

788
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,885
Oh fuck!

789
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,960
Hello?

790
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:52,379
Somebody help! Hello!

791
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:56,341
What the hell
happened to you?

792
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,387
My friend, she's sick.

793
01:02:00,429 --> 01:02:02,848
You don't look so good.
I know.

794
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,849
There's this disease.

795
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,186
I think all my
friends are getting it.

796
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,564
Do you know where
a hospital is around?

797
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:11,773
Yeah.

798
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:15,110
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

799
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:16,987
I'll get a doctor.

800
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:19,281
Bert: Thanks.

801
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:20,991
Pancakes!

802
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:24,328
Pancakes!
No pancakes.

803
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:27,498
Pancakes!
No pancakes!

804
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:40,135
Dennis, I told you
to stay on the swing!

805
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,055
Dennis!

806
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,482
Fuck!

807
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,071
God damn it!
What pancakes!

808
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,033
Why did you come here?

809
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:04,284
Now look what you've done.

810
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:06,370
I just need a doctor, okay?

811
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:08,831
Look what you've done
to this poor boy!

812
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,834
What has he done to you?
I just need

813
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,211
a fucking doctor, man!

814
01:03:14,212 --> 01:03:16,547
I already lost one boy.

815
01:03:16,588 --> 01:03:18,507
I ain't losing another.

816
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:21,051
What if the doctors
can't fix my boy?

817
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:24,721
You get my boy sick,
it's the same as killing him.

818
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:27,307
It's murder!
What?!

819
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:30,978
You being sick,
that's your problem.

820
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,439
Now Dennis is sick,
that's my problem!

821
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:37,943
And if I get sick,
that's Lucille's problem.

822
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:40,988
So we got to stop
the problem.

823
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:44,491
We got to stop
the problem right now!

824
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:46,577
Fenster! Rifle!

825
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:48,120
Fuck you, man!

826
01:03:56,253 --> 01:03:59,131
There are some kids in a cabin.
They got a disease.

827
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,091
They just gave it to Dennis.

828
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:04,261
We'll need the kit.

829
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:10,893
Jesus, Paul,
you did a number on my back.

830
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,228
I'm gonna go find Jeff
and we're walking out of here.

831
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:16,273
What about Bert?
I can't wait for him.

832
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:20,152
I have to get out of here.
What about Karen? Paul?

833
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:58,232
Fuck!

834
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:05,823
Fuck! Fuck!

835
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,070
Oh, fuck!

836
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:04,316
Shit.

837
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:37,850
Up here!

838
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:20,410
Help me!

839
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,902
Bert!
They're coming for you.

840
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:21,281
Who? The deputy?
No, the guy from the store.

841
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,303
I knew these kids were trouble
the minute they stole from Cad.

842
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,389
Good God.

843
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:48,100
They're doing sacrifices
or something.

844
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:50,060
This ain't Christian.

845
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:25,304
Good night, fucker!

846
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:28,974
Got him.

847
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,429
Jeff!

848
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:10,599
Jeff! It's the water!

849
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,852
Wherever you are,
don't drink the water!

850
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:28,659
Hello?

851
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:43,090
Jeff?

852
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:56,562
Jeff!

853
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:07,239
Jeff?

854
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:16,975
Fuck!

855
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:11,989
¢Ü So cheer up,
things will get better ¢Ü

856
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,199
Here, have a big beer.

857
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,076
Come on, drink up.

858
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,579
You've got some sexy hair.

859
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,290
You got sexy shoes, too.

860
01:16:37,014 --> 01:16:40,309
Shit, what the fuck
happened to you, man?

861
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,686
The tow truck.

862
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:44,730
What happened to
the tow truck, Winston?

863
01:16:45,772 --> 01:16:47,191
Oh shit.

864
01:16:47,232 --> 01:16:49,318
The fucking party man.

865
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,528
I'm so fucking sorry
about the tow truck.

866
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,031
I sent it, it broke down.
I had to get a tow truck

867
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,949
to get that fucking
tow truck.

868
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:57,493
What do you need,
you need a ride?

869
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:00,120
Yeah.

870
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:02,372
Yeah, a ride would be good.

871
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,415
Radio: Winston!

872
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,085
Winston, do you copy?
Yes, sir, I copy.

873
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:09,296
I'm still looking for
that underage booze party.

874
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:12,007
Radio: Never mind.
We've got bigger problems.

875
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,885
Some kids up in a cabin
are on a killing spree.

876
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:17,429
There's two,
possibly three casualties.

877
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:20,224
They are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them!

878
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:23,435
They've got some kind of skin virus
that will eat you alive.

879
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:26,814
So if you do see them,
do not hesitate to shoot them.

880
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,817
Do you copy?
Yes. Can you repeat the last part?

881
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:34,613
I said, if you see the kids,
just shoot them on sight!

882
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,413
So, how about that ride?

883
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:46,208
What the fuck?
Just shoot him!

884
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:49,253
Hey, I can't.
You heard the walkie-talkie dude!

885
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:52,297
The fucking gun is in the car.
I just want to get into town.

886
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:55,300
Why don't you just relax?
Get away, fucking fruitcake!

887
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:57,511
You're not going anyplace!

888
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,596
Fuck!
Shit.

889
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,771
Come on, be cool.
Be cool.

890
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,316
Oh fuck!

891
01:18:24,663 --> 01:18:26,623
You fucking idiot!

892
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:30,335
You just fucked up the whole
party, you fucking idiot!

893
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:33,964
The party's over, Winston.

894
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,707
Man: Son.

895
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:35,002
We need you to start
from the beginning.

896
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:41,717
Everybody's dead.

897
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:46,889
We need to know

898
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:49,600
where you got this disease.

899
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:52,936
It was a guy
from the woods.

900
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:59,234
Oh God, he looked
like Bert's marshmallow.

901
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,699
Paul: He told me
he would get a tow truck.

902
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:09,995
I should have killed him too.

903
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:22,674
Doctor: We're not equipped
to handle a situation like this.

904
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:24,718
Cook County is
his only shot.

905
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,887
Fine.

906
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:29,348
You put him in the car

907
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:32,267
and I'll take care of him.

908
01:21:39,024 --> 01:21:40,984
Hey, look who's waking up!

909
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,111
The fucking party man!

910
01:21:43,195 --> 01:21:45,364
I guess the party
ain't over, huh?

911
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:47,616
We have a long night
of partying.

912
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:50,160
A long night.
Water.

913
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:52,788
I ain't got no water.

914
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,165
All I got's a 40.
But if you want some water,

915
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:57,208
I'll find some
for you, okay?

916
01:21:57,209 --> 01:22:00,337
You just sit tight,
I'll take care of you.

917
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:49,071
Holy shit.

918
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,456
They're dead.

919
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:46,086
My God.

920
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,880
All dead.

921
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,844
I made it.

922
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:58,140
I made it.

923
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:03,020
Oh God, I made it.

924
01:25:04,897 --> 01:25:06,440
I did it.

925
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:09,067
I fucking made it.

926
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:12,863
I fucking made it.

927
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:14,781
I did it.

928
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:17,409
I fucking made it!

929
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:19,077
I knew it!

930
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:22,581
I knew it!
I fucking made it!

931
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:27,085
I fucking made it!

932
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,215
I made it!

933
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:33,759
I fucking made it!

934
01:25:51,485 --> 01:25:53,779
You got rid
of that other one, right?

935
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:58,992
Hey, I think there's another one
in the basement.

936
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:04,081
Come on, boys!

937
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,042
Let's do this!

938
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,046
Hey, fellas!

939
01:26:53,088 --> 01:26:55,799
It's been a rough morning
up here.

940
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:57,134
Lemonade, mister?

941
01:26:57,176 --> 01:26:58,677
Thanks, son.
Don't mind if I do.

942
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,221
That's five cents.

943
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:04,016
Businessmen.

944
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,727
You almost take
after your granddad.

945
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:09,188
Cad: They're running me out
of my own business.

946
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:11,523
Stealing me blind right here.

947
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:15,235
Whoa! Now,
that is mighty fine.

948
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:19,615
Mighty fine. Grab a cup, boys.
This round's on me.

949
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:44,556
Here you go, all
polished and everything.

950
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,558
Ain't that a beauty?
Look at that, honey.

951
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,477
Looks like it's brand new.

952
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:51,480
Hi, my nigga, how are you?
What's up, nigga?

953
01:27:51,563 --> 01:27:53,732
Where you been, man?
