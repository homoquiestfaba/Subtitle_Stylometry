I am not lonely because

No, I don't mind going
to a party alone.

00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,638
That is the point of going.

No, mom, not so I
can meet someone.

You know that Annie
messaged me like three times

Wait, did you tell Annie
that she had to make me come?

Did you know that baby carrots

are the same thickness
as a human finger?

to bite into them.

you tell me this?

just stay for five minutes

00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:35,086
A good grad school needs good
lions just in front of it.

180
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,923
So you know it's good education.

181
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,161
We should have made these
before people got here!

182
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,562
They would have been cold.

183
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,164
That's why we
don't do hot apps.

184
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,564
You love hot apps.

185
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,968
Yeah, when someone
else is making them.

186
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,202
There's no need to
over-complicate our parties.

187
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:53,671
This was a small upgrade.

188
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:54,906
We get better every year.

189
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,774
Here we go.

190
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:56,742
Ally-oop.

191
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:57,642
Hot apps.

192
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:08,920
Well, at least
I'm not the only one

193
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,523
that got the ugly sweater memo.

194
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:15,593
You must be Tom's
high school friend.

195
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,162
The outspoken one?

196
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,298
[laughs] Junior high.

197
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,766
Oh, okay.

198
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,536
Close.

199
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,203
I'm Natalie.

200
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,107
And you don't know anyone
at this party, Natalie.

201
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,675
What's my tell?

202
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,876
The way you're downing
that drink while pretending

203
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:33,177
to be interested in
Tom's graphic novels.

204
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,080
Okay.

205
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:36,581
Well, what's your excuse?

206
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,284
I'm merely an observer of
this grand social experiment.

207
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,019
Ah, so you're
just here to judge?

208
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,621
Yeah, it did kind of win you
over with the sweater line.

209
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,190
Hm, keep telling
yourself that.

210
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,293
So this is going really well.

211
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,961
Ah, you're really perceptive!

212
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:52,130
What do you do, Natalie?

213
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,064
I didn't get your name.

214
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,032
Don't change the subject.

215
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,167
What do you do?

216
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,603
I'm in grad school
for psychology.

217
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,004
Huh, wow.

218
00:08:59,037 --> 00:08:59,872
Go figure.

219
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:00,872
Oh...

220
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,106
No, I'm impressed.

221
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,043
That's genuinely very cool.

222
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:10,848
What?

223
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,050
Nothing.

224
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,952
I'm just waiting for
your snarky comeback.

225
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,086
Wow.

226
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,655
You've got my number already.

227
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,692
You're gonna be really
good at this shrink thing.

228
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,960
Thank you.

229
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,728
Yeah, I'm already
psychoanalyzing you.

230
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,063
Many have tried,
none have succeeded.

231
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,331
Oh, is that a challenge?

232
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:36,841
You don't want
another drink, do you?

233
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,647
You're aggressive
for a psyche major.

234
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,582
You're projecting
your own desires.

235
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,851
Okay, my plan would
be to just get rid

236
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,086
of highway patrol all together

237
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,722
and just put like tow
trucks at every exit.

238
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,957
Just take them
straight to the garage.

239
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,826
I'm not sure that's how, I...

240
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,259
Big stop, ready to go.

241
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,828
Just done and done.

242
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,863
How many times has your
car broken down on a freeway?

243
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:01,033
Like, 10, 15 times.

244
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,802
[both grunting]

245
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,138
[Man At Door] Come on,
you're taking to long.

246
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,006
One minute.

247
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,307
Only a minute?

248
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,241
[Annie] Tom, Tom!

249
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:11,744
[smoke alarm beeping]

250
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,814
I've got an extinguisher
in my apartment!

251
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,249
There's nothing in the oven,

252
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:18,216
but the smoke just keeps coming!

253
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,951
Okay, did you try water?

254
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,220
Yeah, I did, I tried water.

255
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,254
Sorry, all right.

256
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,122
[Annie] Fill this, fill this.

257
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,122
[Tom] Sorry.

258
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:24,989
Did I do that?

259
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:26,024
No, I don't know.

260
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,861
[Tom] Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

261
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,096
[smoke alarm beeping]

262
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,730
Wait, what is that?

263
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:33,865
You smell that?

264
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,067
Excuse me?

265
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,134
What is that smell?

266
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,036
Oh shit!

267
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:39,437
- Oh shit!
- Oh my God!

268
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,407
- Oh my God!
- Well don't panic.

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,042
Well that's really
not helpful, is it?

270
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,145
Oh, I got it, I got it, yeah.

271
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,112
Oh, you think
that's gonna save us?

272
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:49,414
Well, I don't see
you doing anything.

273
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,182
You can fit through
that window, right?

274
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,184
What do you mean, can I fit?

275
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,086
Can you fit?

276
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:54,952
Come on!

277
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:55,987
I'm saving our lives.

278
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,056
You go first, I've got you.

279
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,892
[Natalie] All
right, here we go.

280
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,125
I'm a little afraid of
heights, by the way.

281
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:02,226
They live on the first floor.

282
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,428
[Natalie] Yeah, you're right.

283
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:04,629
[Logan] Sorry about
the hands on the butt.

284
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:06,398
[Natalie] Don't worry about
being a gentleman right now.

285
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,733
Okay.

286
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:08,766
- You got it?
- Yeah, I think so.

287
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,067
- [Logan] You good?
- Yeah.

288
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,303
[sirens wailing]

289
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,807
Sorry Santa. [grunts]

290
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,143
Started yoga.

291
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,045
[Natalie] Yeah, it does help.

292
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:21,079
[firetrucks honking]

293
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,781
[Natalie laughing]

294
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:23,448
Are you okay?

295
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:24,315
Yeah, are you?

296
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,484
[laughing] Yeah.

297
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:28,220
Let's go see if Tom
and Annie are up there.

298
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:31,256
[friends clapping]

299
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:32,423
Oh my God.

300
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:35,093
Really could have used
the bathroom, Logan.

301
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,828
Cliff had to let me use his.

302
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,966
So it's Logan, right?

303
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:42,768
Huh.

304
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,003
[camera clicking]

305
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,738
I'm just so humiliated.

306
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,741
Oh honey, these things happen.

307
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,075
When was the last
time you were at a party

308
00:11:50,107 --> 00:11:51,743
where the fire
department was called?

309
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,312
Okay, at least it
was a kitchen fire?

310
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,747
If it had happened near a tree

311
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,247
it could have been
really dangerous.

312
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,483
It's true, trees
go up in seconds.

313
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,085
Have you seen those videos?

314
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,487
Would you want
one of your clients

315
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,121
to be known as the person
with the kitchen fire?

316
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,124
Okay, that's
besides the point.

317
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,358
It would never happen.

318
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,159
But if it did happen,
I would turn it around

319
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,294
and maybe add a catch
phrase or something.

320
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,029
Arson Annie? [laughs]

321
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,331
Okay, not that one.

322
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,866
This one is so
awesome, it just, whoosh,

323
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,235
it just goes up so fast.

324
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,336
They say I saved the day.

325
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:24,243
All right, ma'am, everything's
under control in there,

326
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,310
but pretty smokey, so
I'd leave the windows

327
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,479
and doors open for awhile.

328
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:28,513
How long awhile?

329
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,382
I don't know, an hour, maybe?

330
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:31,516
And between you and me,

331
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,285
don't store potholders
under the oven.

332
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,458
You should know,
I've never done this,

333
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:41,860
not even in college.

334
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:45,096
Wait, should I be
telling you that?

335
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,398
Nah, you couldn't resist me

336
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:48,267
from the moment I
started talking to you.

337
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,269
Oh, you need to stop
saying shit like that.

338
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,470
I tee you up to
say something sweet

339
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,839
and then you say
the grossest things.

340
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:57,308
You didn't think that
twenty minutes ago.

341
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,813
Wait, do you have
plans for New Year's?

342
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:06,184
Ah, you know, they're
kind of still up in the air.

343
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,920
Do you think Tom and Annie
were trying to set us up?

344
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,889
I don't know.

345
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,091
I mean, they think there's
something wrong with you

346
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,594
if you haven't latched on to
a mate and committed yourself

347
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,128
to someone by now, so.

348
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,165
You haven't been in many
longterm relationships?

349
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:23,034
What does that mean?

350
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,002
Just a guess.

351
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:27,605
I've had some long-ish
relationships, okay?

352
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,908
No judgment from me, okay?

353
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,110
Tom and Annie married
their college sweetheart.

354
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:33,378
Why would you settle
if you don't even know

355
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,246
what's out there
in the first place?

356
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:39,084
I don't need like a
smorgasbord or something.

357
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:43,188
And what exactly
are you getting at?

358
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:46,291
I don't know, Mr.
My-plans-are-up-in-the-air.

359
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:51,062
[laughs] Bet no guy is
ever good enough for you.

360
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,464
Do you ever let anyone in?

361
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,532
I mean, you hide behind
these cynical comments,

362
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,335
hoping nobody ever
sees the real you.

363
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,971
I mean, I barely know you,
but it feels like nobody does.

364
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,639
Insulting a guy is a great
way to get to know him.

365
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,507
Oh, well ladies love it
when they hook up with a guy

366
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,942
who then proceeds to analyze
their dating history.

367
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:06,345
It's a real turn on for a guy

368
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,381
when a girl says how no guy's
ever good enough for her.

369
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,482
That's an anecdote you
should save for more parties.

370
00:14:11,515 --> 00:14:13,485
I think we're done here.

371
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,353
Oh come on.

372
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:15,586
You started it.

373
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,556
We can just forget
this happened.

374
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:18,624
Dance party!

375
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,225
I'm so not a dancer.

376
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:21,426
I'd take her word for it.

377
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,160
Okay. I braved the
smoke for these guys.

378
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:24,362
Come on.

379
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,429
[Man] Jello shots!

380
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:26,298
Come on.

381
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,164
Come on.

382
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:28,033
Come on, ah-ha.

383
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:28,934

Listen, I'm not
asking, it's my mother.

401
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,432
Since I'm not
procreating, she's hoping

402
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,469
that someone from the family
can take one for the team.

403
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,170
It's not that
we're against kids.

404
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,472
We just aren't
ready for one yet.

405
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,307
Besides Tom and I
were practically kids

406
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,043
when we started
dating and you know,

407
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,245
we have plenty of time.

408
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,048
Yeah, your eggs are gonna
be good for at least a decade.

409
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,984
Probably exactly a decade.

410
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,119
I am not that
much older than you.

411
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:56,588
I know. but we've established
that I'm a lost cause.

412
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,156
You rule people out before
you give them a fair chance.

413
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,559
That is patently untrue.

414
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:01,994
World of Warcraft
credit card guy.

415
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,661
Red flag.

416
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:03,594
Organic deodorant man.

417
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,197
Yuck!

418
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,697
The optometrist with the
competitive laser tag team?

419
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,066
Hard pass.

420
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,768
Tom has plenty
of weird hobbies.

421
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,703
Remember his
ventriloquist phase?

422
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,471
I'm not having this
conversation with you.

423
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:14,706
Neither am I.

424
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,176
You'll find someone.

425
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,744
You just have to be open to it.

426
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,613
You will find them when
you're least expecting it.

427
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:23,014
What do you know?

428
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:23,648
I mean, you guys met
when you were kids.

429
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,516
Exactly.

430
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,217
We weren't expecting it.

431
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,418
I can get it.

432
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,285
Tom will get it.

433
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,553
Tom?

434
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,322
[Tom] I'm cleaning
out the bathtub.

435
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:34,192
I Thought you were gonna do
that when I started cooking?

436
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,695
[Tom] I had to
create a new playlist.

437
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,229
I can get it, seriously.

438
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,370
Oh, hi.

439
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,772
Hi.

440
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,106
I'm the first one here?

441
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:50,808
Ah, no.

442
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,811
I already got that title.

443
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,712
Logan.

444
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,113
I know.

445
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,682
Ha, ha, ha, Logan!

446
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,384
Wait, where's the ice?

447
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,153
Oh shit, I knew there
was a reason I left early.

448
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,621
Sorry dude, I Ubered.

449
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,523
[Annie] Wait, he
didn't bring the ice?

450
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,726
But we need a
bunch of bags, Tom.

451
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,326
Listen, I'll just
go out and get it.

452
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,728
I'm sure there's a grocery
store around the corner.

453
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,129
That's great.

454
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,531
[Annie] Wait, will
she get back in time?

455
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,432
The sooner she
leaves the better.

456
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,599
I'll be fine.

457
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:16,668
[Annie] But how
can she carry it all?

458
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,403
We need a bunch of bags, Tom?

459
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,271
What if Logan
goes with Natalie

460
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,539
and then they can carry
the bags together?

461
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,740
[Annie] That's perfect.

462
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,211
Great.

463
00:17:26,243 --> 00:17:27,778
We'll go get the ice.

464
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:28,679
Together.

465
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,529
I'm sorry.

466
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:47,132
I didn't know anyone
would be sitting there.

467
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,701
You are quite the hoarder.

468
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:52,203
That is hardly hoarding.

469
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,338
Oh, pardon me.

470
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,107
It's just the back
issues of old magazines

471
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,576
and a bunch of half
drunken water bottles.

472
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,711
If there's an earthquake,
I will have water.

473
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:01,612
I'll be sure to find
you in the grid goes down.

474
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,780
You didn't have
to come with me.

475
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,283
I don't know why you did.

476
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,153
Geez, did you see this
one about the fault line

477
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:10,521
in the Pacific Northwest?

478
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:13,291
They are screwed. [laughs]

479
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,727
You're really not going
to say anything, are you?

480
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,627
Unbelievable.

481
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,596
Last Clarkmas?

482
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,165
We hooked up!

483
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:22,634
[laughs] Oh man, the
captions on these cartoons

484
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,235
gets me every time.

485
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,605
I know that I've seen you
around town several times

486
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,740
and every single time
you've avoided me.

487
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,509
Once at the ArcLight and twice

488
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,876
at the Third Street Promenade.

489
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,878
Look, I don't know.

490
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,246
I know it was you.

491
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,448
Maybe you just
wanted to see me.

492
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,817
Isn't there a psychological
term for that?

493
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,519
[laughs] The only
term that is coming

494
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:42,553
to my mind right now is Asshole.

495
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,588
What, I'm supposed to
remember every random hookup?

496
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:49,628
[laughs] Oh, we
had a conversation.

497
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,229
Perhaps.

498
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:51,929
Oh shit, the supermarket.

499
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:52,797
[horn honking]

500
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:53,698
Sorry.

501
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,912
Hey, any of these
spots would work.

502
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,147
I'm finding a spot
near the entrance.

503
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,750
Still don't know
how to settle.

504
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,219
All right.

505
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,788
I am officially taking
the higher road here.

506
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,322
We can start over.

507
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:19,724
Like nothing happened.

508
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:21,792
Nothing did happen.

509
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:23,761
Great.

510
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,829
Fantastic.

511
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:26,364
Perfect.

512
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:27,598
Love it.

513
00:19:31,435 --> 00:19:33,304
[Logan] There was
actually a closer spot.

514
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,274
I don't know what's
taking them so long.

515
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,309
I'm sure they're minutes away.

516
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,880
That better be them.

517
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:46,817
I can't believe they
only had two bags left.

518
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:48,887
You look like you're
struggling to just hold the one.

519
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm kidding.

520
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,524
Here, come on, give it to me.

521
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:54,593
Let me take it.

522
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,559
You don't have to.

523
00:19:55,593 --> 00:19:56,595
No seriously, I'd like to.

524
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,297
Okay.

525
00:19:59,329 --> 00:19:59,964
Oh, geez.

526
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,933
Yeah, it's heavy.

527
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,973
Thank you for keeping
the ice on your lap.

528
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,407
I just didn't want to
get my stuff all wet.

529
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,875
You know, I've got some
pretty important papers

530
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:12,576
in there somewhere.

531
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:13,777
At least my body will be numb

532
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,446
if you get us into an accident.

533
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,616
[breaks squealing]

534
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,518
Oops.

- Hey, cheese!
- Oh, come on.

537
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,459
Come on in you crazy kids.

538
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,596
I thank you.

539
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:34,465
Yeah, I'm so glad there's
evidence of that thank you.

540
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,634
Annie's cool with this?

541
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,701
It's all the rage.

542
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,868
It's called a beer throw

543

You always think of something.

545
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,375
Hot appetizers were
off limits this year.

546
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,977
I was afraid to ask.

547
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:46,944
Hey, Natalie?

548
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:53,284
Just between us, Annie's not
really saying a lot about it

549
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,353
but she was just laid
off from her job.

550
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,354
What?

551
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:57,588
Just maybe don't bring it up.

552
00:20:57,622 --> 00:20:59,391
Just try to keep things calm.

553
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:02,027
I just really need
everything to run smoothly.

554
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,528
Yeah, of course.

555
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,596
Oh my God.

556
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:05,462
Poor Annie.

557
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:06,331
She's good.

558
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,432
She's great.

559
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,601
She just hates anything
changing, ever.

560
00:21:10,634 --> 00:21:11,802
That's so Annie.

561
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:13,305
Do you know that she
had the same haircut

562
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,072
from ages seven to 17?

563
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,040
No.

564
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:16,975
She would have kept it too.

565
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,777
except when she was
blowing out the candles

566
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:21,011
at her 17th birthday party,
her bangs caught on fire.

567
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,781
Don't say, and
don't say fire either.

568
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,449
So I ran out of
my apartment, like,

569
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:26,017
with a fire extinguisher in hand

570
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,985
and I put out the
fire right as like,

571
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,854
the firefighters were showing up

572
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:30,922
and I think they were jealous

573
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,523
because they missed the action.

574
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,527
But smoke was like
billowing up in my face.

575
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,863
And Annie, she had put
like flammable material

576
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:40,898
in the drawer underneath.

577
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,801
Are you gonna tell
everyone about it, Cliff?

578
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:44,803
She's interested.

579
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:45,937
You're interested, right?

580
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,506
But what's your, I
didn't catch your name.

581
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:49,473
It's Megan.

582
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,576
Megan is very interested, so.

583
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,811
I was just coming
to put my coat down.

584
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,079
Ah-huh, okay.

585
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:56,681
So have you ever put out a fire?

586
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:57,781
Because sometimes you're like,

Oh yeah, I just
got these socks.

I just live right
across the hall.

00:22:18,935 --> 00:22:21,972
Oh, you know who
friended me on Facebook?

00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,041
Naomi Hagar.

00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,910
Whoa, Naomi?

How is she, how's she doing?

From light internet stalking,

she seems to be doing very well.

597

Somehow she seems to
moved on from you.

598
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,457
It has been a decade
since we graduated.

599
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,558
Do you remember that
debate trip that we went on

600
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,461
and you ended up
missing your event,

601
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:44,661
you had to take
her to urgent care?

602

And she just barfed all
over your front seat.

That smell never went away.

Annie wanted me to tell you

that your guacamole
is running low.

like I didn't know you earlier.

I just thought it
might be easier?

It wasn't an apology per se.

That was worse than the
Milgram shock experiment.

It's like where
they're being tortured,

fear of authority,

00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,708
It's a beautiful color.

716
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,110
Thank you.

717
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,079
You're actually not the first
person to say that tonight.

718
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:57,715
This all makes a
lot of sense now.

719
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,683
This is what you
were trying to avoid.

720
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,286
Looks like it
didn't work, Logan.

721
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:03,388
No, not at all.

722
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,255
We can start over.

723
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:05,656
We're just strangers.

724
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,859
Logan and I are just
a bunch of strangers.

725
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,027
But last year, you two...

726
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:09,993
I think I'm gonna
get another beer.

727
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:10,995
You want to join me honey?

728
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,096
No, I'm good.

729
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,001
This is awkward.

730
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:19,336
Didn't have to be.

731
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:20,804
Don't go placing the
blame on me, you started it.

732
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,240
You're kind of
obsessed with me.

733
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:23,840
I simply acknowledge who
I've made out with before.

734
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:25,942
Come on, all those times
stocking me around town.

735
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:27,311
Oh my God, you wish.

736
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:30,181
Oh my God, why would anyone
put a beer in a bathtub?

737
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,215
It's all the rage.

738
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:33,050
Hey, Cuz.

739
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:35,220
What is going on over here?

740
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,160
You're Annie, right?

741
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:44,428
This is your soiree?

742
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,762
It's absolutely lovely.

743
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,065
It's so cozy.

744
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,298
Everything's just right.

745
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,135
Like really, thank
you for having us.

746
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:52,769
Who is she?

747
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:53,738
[All] His lady friend.

748
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:56,073
I see.

749
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,908
Yeah. I didn't mean
to make a scene.

750
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,477
Logan's being kind
of a dick, actually.

751
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:00,845
I tried to make good.

752
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:01,979
You tried to
cover your tracks.

753
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,815
Oh my God, you
can't let anything go.

754
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:04,781
You let everything go.

755
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:06,817
Just stop, both of you, okay?

756
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:09,453
Why can't we have a nice time?

757
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,957
Can someone please
just pass me a beer.

758
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:22,232
Thank you.

759
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:34,278
Thanks for coming.

760
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,848
I don't go home
for the holidays.

761
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,484
This is my Christmas.

762
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:42,486
You're Jewish.

763
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,387
I know.

764
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:45,956
Great party, man.

765
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:51,495
Later.

766
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,469
Well, at least we've got
enough alcohol for new years.

767
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,370
We can take it to
Chris and Megan's.

768
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,807
They're having us over
at their new place.

769
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,407
Did they buy?

770
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:05,809
Apparently.

771
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,112
I thought it would be
rude to ask the details,

772
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:10,514
but I looked it up and
I think they overpaid.

773
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,386
Do you wish we had a house?

774
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,259
Sure, of course, but
we're fine where we are.

775
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:24,228
This place is cozy, according
to Logan's new lady friend.

776
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,198
He really needs to
stop calling her that.

777
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,335
Toilet's running again.

778
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,936
I guess this place is cozy.

779
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,006
Are you happy?

780
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:38,909
With me?

781
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,212
Are you kidding?

782
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:44,115
Of course.

783
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:46,884
You're my best lady friend.

784
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,388
[Annie laughing]

785
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,899
[festive music]

786
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,204
We're not gonna
have enough food.

787
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,405
Hey good looking.

788
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,574
You are changing the subject.

789
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:11,474
We have 52 people confirmed.

790
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,344
Luckily we know
a bunch of flakes.

791
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,381
Because, pun intended.

792
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:19,383
Did you really have to
invite all your work friends?

793
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:20,517
I don't even know them.

794
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,319
Well, this could be a great
way to get to know them.

795
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,022
Does Logan have another
lady friend coming today, too?

796
00:30:25,055 --> 00:30:26,591
I don't know, we
don't really talk

797
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,959
about that kind of thing.

798
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:28,593
Are the little ones,
should I just get rid

799
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,359
of the little ones?

800
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:31,962
Honey?

801
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,131
[Annie] They're great.

802
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:36,034
Yeah, they're great.

803
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,537
We should have
made more truffles.

804
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:40,937
[Tom] There's some
broccoli in the fridge,

805
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:42,205
you could put the head out.

806
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:44,342
Nobody's gonna eat
a head of broccoli.

807
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,576
They will if
they're desperate.

808
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:47,944
So you admit that
we don't have enough.

809
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:49,346
I do not admit that.

810
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,915
I think that no matter
how much food you put out,

811
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:52,950
Doug's just gonna demolish it.

812
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,184
What are these lights for?

813
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,887
I was thinking it
could be kind of fun

814
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,989
if they were up
around the windows.

815
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,956
Someone wants to
impress his work friends.

816
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,392
No.

817
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:02,259
Hmm?

818
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,994
Maybe a little.

819
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,961
That's just human.

820
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:05,962
And they're not my work friends,

821
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:07,365
they're just my new friends.

822
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:10,600
They're, they're, they're
just friends of mine.

823
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,103
Well if they know
the guy I know,

824
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,538
then they're already impressed.

825
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:19,242
There's a position
opening up in the new year.

826
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:22,313
I'm the choice, but
they are interviewing

827
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:23,513
outside the company too.

828
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,115
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

829
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:27,284
It's not a big deal, really.

830
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:28,451
How are these tangled

831
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,387
if all they do is sit
in a box all year?

832
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,289
Who do I have to bribe
to get you the job?

833
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,359
I will ply them with eggnog.

834
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:36,693
Lenora.

835
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,296
She's on the committee.

836
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,463
I just have to prove to
her that I'm responsible.

837
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:42,667
But cool, hip.

838
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,269
But you'd trust me with
a million dollar account.

839
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:47,038
You always managed
to start a project

840
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,205
right before people get here.

841
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,674
Well, is it maybe a
bad time to tell you

842
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,477
that I ordered a
karaoke machine?

843
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:54,345
Kidding.

844
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:56,980
Oh, there we go.

845
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:57,948
How'd you do that?

846
00:31:57,981 --> 00:31:58,982
Easy.

847
00:31:59,016 --> 00:31:59,650
Easy?

848
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:00,584
You're welcome.

849
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:01,418
Thank you.

850
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:04,488
Easy.

851
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,692
[festive music]

852
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:09,126
[All] Cheers!

853
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:12,430
[Man] You're a wonderful host!

854
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,197
[Annie] Thank you.

855
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:19,503
Okay, so furniture
stores are going

856
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:22,073
out of business all the
time, and yet, economically,

857
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:24,407
I don't understand how
they have everything

858
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,477
for 80% off all the time.

859
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,379
Maybe the actual
price is just 80% under

860
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:31,182
what they try to sell it for?

861
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,216
It's either the worst
business to be in or the best.

862
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,285
I don't know.

863
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:35,452
I haven't decided.

864
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,488
Nina, oh my gosh,
those look incredible.

865
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,556
I'll hide these in the kitchen

866
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,057
so you and Tom can try them.

867
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:40,958
May I?

868
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:45,996
You can have one.

869
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:47,397
Is that salted caramel?

870
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,533
And candied Rosemary with
a brown butter finished.

871
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:53,203
I thought it was
grass. [laughs]

872
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:55,173
I'll find Tom.

873
00:32:58,107 --> 00:33:01,144
Just because it,
it looks like grass.

874
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,015
[laughing] And so he
leaves the audition,

875
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,750
which is terrible, and on the
way out he grabs a handful

876
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,221
of grapes and he looks at me
and he goes, "Arrivederci."

877
00:33:10,253 --> 00:33:11,421
[all laughing]

878
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:12,389
Please tell me you cast him.

879
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,624
The director wanted to!

880
00:33:13,656 --> 00:33:14,591
No!

881
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,359
Tom, I've got a treat for you.

882
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:18,496
[Tom] What are
these, pray tell?

883
00:33:18,528 --> 00:33:20,096
Lenora, get in there.

884
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,100
Oh my God, orgasmic.

885
00:33:23,232 --> 00:33:25,502
What are you, like
the cookie goddess?

886
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,071
[laughing] Oh, I love that.

887
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,806
Oh my God, that's so funny.

888
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:31,107
Nina, this is Lenora,
Lenora, this is Nina.

889
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:32,243
These are incredible.

890
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,178
Yeah, they were.

891
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:41,418
Thank you, Nina.

892
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:43,421
What is going on there?

893
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:44,621
What do you mean?

894
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:45,455
Were we not supposed

Happy holidays.

I thought you'd be impressed
that I remembered your name.

906
00:34:18,588 --> 00:34:21,858
It's kind of a basic human
expectation that I have

907

after I've met someone
a number of times.

908

Well, yeah.

a different profile photo?

You don't want to
do psychology anymore?

No, I do.

1049
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:03,106
I just, I don't
know where or how.

1050
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,507
They teach you the academics

1051
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,610
but they don't
give you a roadmap.

1052
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,646
And I feel like everyone in my
program is setting down roots

1053
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,717
and finding their direction,
and no path feels right to me.

1054
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,617
I don't know.

1055

I've never known
what I wanted.

I joined ROTC on a whim

1057
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,161
and ended up overseas
after graduation.

1058
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,764
I thought I'll be
career military.

1059
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:33,371

home, got into tech, here I am.

00:39:57,626 --> 00:39:58,895
Stop hogging the game.

1072
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,930
Isn't that what
you're doing, Doug?

1073
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,731
I am the reigning champion.

1074
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,166
Oh, okay.

1075
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,634
You know what cliff, maybe
you can, you can jump in.

1076
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,471
[music building]

1077
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,143
[Lenora screaming]

1078
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:14,878
Yeah!

1079
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:16,512
Holy mother of...

1080
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:17,614
It's bad, isn't it?

1081
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:19,750
Way to go, Tom.

1082
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:24,421
Do you have any
plans for new years?

1083
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,723
I got a few options.

1084
00:40:26,755 --> 00:40:29,091
Ah, you don't want to commit

1085
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,061
because you're fielding offers

1086
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:32,729
and you want to keep
your options open

1087
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,865
unless something
better comes up.

1088
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,533
I know.

1089
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,468
The shrink program
is really working.

1090
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:42,606
I actually hate new years.

1091
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,041
I really do, too much pressure.

1092
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,943
You know, you rack your brain
to do something special,

1093
00:40:46,976 --> 00:40:48,545
when all you really
want to do is sit home

1094
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:50,079
and watch the ball drop.

1095
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:53,683
But instead you go out, you
spend way too much money.

1096
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,552
You stand in a room
full of strangers

1097
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:59,522
counting down to a new year
in hopes it will be better

1098
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:01,191
than the one you just had?

1099
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:04,193
You've never had a good new
year's, that's your problem.

1100
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:06,062
I suppose you've had so many?

1101
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,233
[laughs] Tom and I had
some good ones after college.

1102
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:12,134
We were both home for the
holidays and neither one

1103
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,972
of us wanted to feel stuck
at our parents' places.

1104
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:20,010
And my mom, I love her, but
she just worries about me.

1105
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,247
Always has, always will.

1106
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,115
And she didn't want me out
on the road with, you know,

1107
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:27,750
all the crazies on the road.

1108
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:28,986
I don't know if you
know this or not,

1109
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,687
but after 2:00 AM,
it is crazy central.

1110
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:32,922
So I've heard.

1111
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:37,260
So Tom and I would just camp
out in my parents' basement,

1112
00:41:37,293 --> 00:41:40,730
play Gin Rummy and drink my
grandmother's boxed wine.

1113
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:45,601
If that's the case, why settle

1114
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:48,272
for some lame warehouse party?

1115
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:50,540
Sounds like you already
know what you want.

1116
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:58,182
Excuse me, is
this your residence?

1117
00:41:59,148 --> 00:41:59,983
No.

1118
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,985
Thank you, ma'am.

1119
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,659
Miss would have been fine.

1120
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:12,663
Ugh!
[electricity buzzing]

1121
00:42:12,695 --> 00:42:14,297
It's really not that bad.

1122
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,867
The sting goes away
relatively quickly.

1123
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,168
I should know, I lost
about eight times.

1124
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,238
Uh, you weren't wearing rings.

1125
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:23,574
I have a ring.

1126
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:28,012
It's open get in here!

1127
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:37,820
It's his place

1128
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,063
Sir?

1129
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,630
Is this your apartment?

1130
00:42:47,664 --> 00:42:48,298
Yes.

1131
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:49,199
Yes it is.

1132
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:50,601
But we don't own it.

1133
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,637
We, we rent, which is
not what you asked.

1134
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,838
That's not what I, yeah.

1135
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,807
Look, we received
a noise complaint.

1136
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,976
Really?

1137
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,610
Oh, that's probably
when Lenora lost.

1138
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:01,711
She screamed.

1139
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:04,114
Sorry about that.

1140
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:05,648
We were playing a little game.

1141
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:07,351
All right.

1142
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,686
I thought this would be kids.

1143
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,757
Aren't you a little old
to be throwing ragers?

1144
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:15,826
Myself?

1145
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:16,793
No, I don't think so.

1146
00:43:16,826 --> 00:43:18,628
I'm very hip, you have no idea.

1147
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:20,831
You are?

1148
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,367
I'm very cool,
I'm very relaxed.

1149
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,737
All right.

1150
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:28,170
How about you tell me that
you're wrapping things up

1151
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:31,108
and that as you do, you'll
keep things quiet in here.

1152
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,744
I promise you that we
were going to wrap it up.

1153
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,945
I don't mean
literally tell me,

1154
00:43:34,978 --> 00:43:36,246
I just mean, like you
get what I'm saying,

1155
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:38,014
like that's what's happening.

1156
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:39,248
Yes, I promise we will.

1157
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:41,218
It's gonna be a house
of mouse, mouses.

1158
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:43,786
It's gonna be quiet.

1159
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,322
Okay.

1160
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:47,356
Feels like we've
already started.

1161
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:48,257
Yeah.

1162
00:43:57,166 --> 00:44:01,038
Anyway, happy holidays.

1163
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,072
[Tom] Thank you.

1164
00:44:02,105 --> 00:44:03,072
You as well, also with you.

1165
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,975
All right.

1166
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:06,876
Drive safe.

1167
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:10,146
I'll explain it later.

1168
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,815
[all laughing]

1169
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,152
Is the coast clear?

1170
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,057
The last time the cops busted
a party, I was in high school.

1171
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,259
My instincts kicked in.

1172
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,295
It's like we're
back in college.

1173
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:26,829
Cheer up, it's all fine.

1174
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:29,065
How is it I'm the one
who's not freaking out?

1175
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,836
Hey man, I was using
your bathroom earlier

1176
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:36,138
and the toilet
just keeps running.

1177
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,041
Like I jiggled the
handle and everything

1178
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,710
and it just won't stop.

1179
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:41,210
So I think you should fix that.

1180
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:42,179
Okay, thanks Cliff.

1181
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:43,045
Because it's just a big waste.

1182
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,414
Got it, yep.

1183
00:44:44,447 --> 00:44:46,349
We gotta get going.

1184
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,583
Oh.

1185
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,319
Yeah, we gotta get all the
way back to the west side, so.

1186
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:50,319
Great party, man.

1187
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,722
Thank you, yeah.

1188
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:52,923
Listen it's not
usually like this.

1189
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,057
We're very responsible.

1190
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,958
See you Monday.

1191
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:56,960
Do you want to grab
a bite or something?

1192
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:58,061
I'm starving.

1193
00:44:58,094 --> 00:44:58,929
[Byron] Yeah.

1194
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,130
Let's get out of here.

1195
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:01,264
All right, I'll see
you on Monday then.

1196
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:03,833
It's good.

1197
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,168
It's okay.

1198
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,235
Starving, she said.

1199
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:09,038
I have some cookies left.

1200
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:10,006
- Doug, not now.
- For what?

1201
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,208
- Not now.
- For them.

1202
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,108
They're gone.

1203
00:45:13,842 --> 00:45:15,177
So it's not really
my style to ask,

1204
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,779
but I don't have your number.

1205
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,849
Is that a question, exactly?

1206
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,117
Fine, can I have your number?

1207
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,186
Well, only because
you asked so nicely.

1208
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,257
What are you doing?

1209
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,824
Getting a pen.

1210
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,393
Just put it on
my phone, are you...

1211
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:32,496
No, I'm writing it down.

1212
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:33,831
This is a test, Logan.

1213
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:37,099
Will you put my
number in your phone

1214
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:39,368
or do you lose this
piece of paper?

1215
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:42,438
Okay.

1216
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:43,407
I hope you pass.

1217
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,010
You have to grab it too.

1218
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,445
Is this is another test?

1219
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,849
No.

1220
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,528
I got it.

1221
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,996
I let you get it.

1222
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,166
Walk you to your car?

1223
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,067
Yes, please.

1224
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,043
It's like we never see
each other at our parties.

1225
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:23,914
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1226
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,782
You're always
busy playing host.

1227
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:28,084
You are too, you know.

1228
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:30,353
It's not a complaint.

1229
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:34,324
It's just nice to get
some me and you time.

1230
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,528
Even if it's after
everyone else's left?

1231
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,463
Who leaves their
drink in a plant?

1232
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,471
You think we'll have
this party forever?

1233
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:49,438
Yeah, of course.

1234
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,907
I don't know.

1235
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,376
It's just such a thing.

1236
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:55,445
And I love that it's a thing.

1237
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:56,813
It's our thing.

1238
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,183
But do you think
we'll do it forever?

1239
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:04,020
I guess I just kind of
assumed that we would.

1240
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:09,525
Do you feel stuck with me?

1241
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,094
Where is this coming from?

1242
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:14,531
Do you feel stuck with me?

1243
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:19,268
I just want to make sure that
we're progressing, you know.

1244
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:21,938
Our life is changing.

1245
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:22,873
It's not stagnant.

1246
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:27,411
I'm happy just the way we are.

1247
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:32,516
Are you the way
you are forever?

1248
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,853
This is a tradition.

1249
00:47:37,186 --> 00:47:39,389
We have thrown this party
at this very apartment

1250
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,157
for the last seven years.

1251
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:43,192
It's special.

1252
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,528
People look forward to it.

1253
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:47,998
I look forward to it.

1254
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:50,333
I know, I do too.

1255
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,103
I just want to make sure
that we're growing together.

1256
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:56,572
I think that's
what we're doing.

1257
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,610
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1258
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:20,063
[festive music]

1259
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,097
[Annie] Maybe people don't
account for the longer commute.

1260
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,199
[Tom] Only a few minutes after

1261
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:24,534
when we said it would start.

1262
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:25,936
[Annie] Yeah, but Natalie
always shows up early.

1263
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,570
[Tom] That's when
she was coming alone.

1264
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:28,538
[Annie] Well,
what about Cliff?

1265
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,139
He's always obnoxiously early.

1266
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:31,106
Well that's when
all he had to do

1267
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,342
was come across the hallway.

1268
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:34,444
You're right.

1269
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,545
It's fine, it's fine.

1270
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,719
What if nobody wants
to drive this far?

1271
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,653
Oh honey, put
yourself in their shoes.

1272
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:47,190
You would drive
an extra 3 minutes

1273
00:48:47,222 --> 00:48:49,393
to go to your dear
friend's Christmas party.

1274
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:53,462
No, I probably stay in my
PJ's and binge-watch garbage TV.

1275
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:55,465
Oh.

1276
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,367
[doorbell ringing]

1277
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,103
Oh, ah, move, scoot, scoot.

1278
00:49:00,135 --> 00:49:02,338
Okay, all right, yep, yep.

1279
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,644
Oh wow!

1280
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:09,346
Come on in.

1281
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,380
No trouble parking this year.

1282
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,083
Did you hear that, Annie?

1283
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:14,083
She's real!

1284
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:19,588
Sequels are never as
good as the originals.

1285
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:21,423
They would not make one

1286
00:49:21,456 --> 00:49:23,492
if the first one weren't
really, really good.

1287
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,561
And just the alchemy
of trying to make two

1288
00:49:25,594 --> 00:49:27,129
or more great films is something

1289
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:29,132
that almost no one can achieve.

1290
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:30,500
Empire, Dark Knight, Aliens.

1291
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:31,735
Wow, wow, okay.

1292
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,070
First of all, "Alien"
was a masterpiece.

1293
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:35,070
But Reiser!

1294
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:36,605
They could both be great.

1295
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,543
This is Thunderdome.

1296
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:45,749
Two men enter, one
man leaves, Tom.

1297
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,617
Doug is such a sore loser.

1298
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,686
Our first date, I
beat him at Catan.

1299
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:53,455
She handed me
my hat. [laughing]

1300
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:55,125
I thought there might
not be a second date,

1301
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:57,192
the way he was
sulking afterward.

1302
00:49:57,226 --> 00:49:58,361
Knowing Doug,
there had to be one

1303
00:49:58,393 --> 00:49:59,361
so there could be a rematch.

1304
00:49:59,394 --> 00:50:02,331
Which I won, handily.

1305
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:04,233
[doorbell ringing]

1306
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:05,467
I'll get it.

1307
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,038
[Katrina] There was no such
thing as an untouchable enemy.

1308
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,373
Okay, you probably like
the special additions.

1309
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:11,775
[both laughing]

1310
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:13,143
We're gonna go there?

1311
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,780
And before you say anything
and I have to play dumb,

1312
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,381
your mom already
spilled the beans.

1313
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:19,549
Congratulations!

1314
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:20,682
It just happened!

1315
00:50:20,715 --> 00:50:21,916
She promised she
wouldn't tell anyone.

1316
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:25,121
I love your mom, but we both
know she can't keep a secret.

1317
00:50:25,153 --> 00:50:27,657
She's been planning your
wedding since we were kids.

1318
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,325
Your home is beautiful.

1319
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:30,794
Oh, that's very
sweet of you to say.

1320
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,696
We're still settling in.

1321
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,264
The tree looks good.

1322
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:36,232
This time of year.

1323
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,601
Any more than that
would be weird, right?

1324
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:41,838
Adler, come see
Tom in the kitchen.

1325
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,106
[Katrina] If Picasso
had better paint,

1326
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,340
he'd go back and tinker.

1327
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:46,141
No, he would know that
each painting was done.

1328
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,811
An artist knows when to stop.

1329
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,445
Speaking of
knowing when to stop.

1330
00:50:49,478 --> 00:50:51,713
Come on, man, you're on
my side for this, right?

1331
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:52,815
I don't...

1332
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,851
Tom, you remember Adler.

1333
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,052
I'll be back.

1334
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:58,587
I'll be back.

1335
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:02,592
Hey, welcome to the family.

1336
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:04,159
You locked it down quick.

1337
00:51:04,193 --> 00:51:05,862
Yeah, couldn't let
someone else snap her up.

1338
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,730
I already you let her get
away once in high school.

1339
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:09,298
Unsolicited wedding advice,

1340
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:11,467
do not forget to eat
the hors d'oeuvres.

1341
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:12,635
I didn't get a chance
to have a single one

1342
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:14,137
because we were
busy taking pictures

1343
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:15,305
during the cocktail hour.

1344
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,606
And he's still
talking about it.

1345
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:17,474
Well you know.

1346
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,340
Get over it.

1347
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:19,576
Natalie, come talk.

1348
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:21,510
Do you have a date yet?

1349
00:51:21,543 --> 00:51:23,712
It literally
happened this week.

1350
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:26,516
Annie, the last few weeks
have been such a whirlwind.

1351
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:28,284
I mean, we must be getting old

1352
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:30,219
because we started talking
about marriage really quick.

1353
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,888
You are not old.

1354
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,655
Says the woman who's
been married six years.

1355
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:34,757
Seven.

1356
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:37,159
- Hmm.
- Ugh, I'm old.

1357
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:40,263
Oh wow, look at
those little fingers,

1358
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:41,830
and those itty-bitty nails.

1359
00:51:41,864 --> 00:51:43,766
[Megan] Oh, you're
a natural with her.

1360
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:45,434
I thought I was a natural too

1361
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,469
until I changed my first diaper.

1362
00:51:47,503 --> 00:51:49,739
She is adorable, but
she is vindictive.

1363
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:51,673
Are you vindictive?

1364
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:52,909
Yes, okay.

1365
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:54,443
Well that sums that up.

1366
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,145
I love your dress.

1367
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,380
What do you say?

1368
00:51:57,413 --> 00:51:58,248
Say thank you?

1369
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,914
Thank you.

1370
00:51:58,947 --> 00:52:00,182
You're welcome.

1371
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:02,217
Can you give him a high five?

1372
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:03,219
Wow, thank you!

1373
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:04,420
You're so cute.

1374
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,358
Oh, hey man!

1375
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:10,326
Hey, Cliff!

1376
00:52:10,358 --> 00:52:11,494
What's up?

1377
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,862
Oh, classy move
bringing the booze.

1378
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,498
I just brought myself.

1379
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,365
Okay.

1380
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,738
Ow.

1381
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,706
Hey, can you open
this up for me?

1382
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:27,844
You look great.

1383
00:52:27,876 --> 00:52:28,844
You're so cute!

1384
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:30,580
Happy maiden voyage!

1385
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:31,513
Oh.

1386
00:52:31,547 --> 00:52:32,615
Oh no.

1387
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:33,617
I messed that up.

1388
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:37,687
I brought the beer.

1389
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:40,589
Ah, did you get
thirsty on the way in?

1390
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:41,523
Oh, that.

1391
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:42,925
I got Cliff-ed on the way in.

1392
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,259
Ah, well, when in Rome.

1393
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:46,528
Ah, Heisler my favorite.

1394
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:49,364
You've got great taste.

1395
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:51,534
It's your first time
to the new place, yeah?

1396
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:52,936
It is, it is.

1397
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,671
Yeah, man, I wish I could
have come over sooner.

1398
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:58,208
I just, I went home
a lot this year, so.

1399
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:00,777
Yeah.

1400
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:02,612
You hanging in there?

1401
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:03,947
Can we just talk
about the fact

1402
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,481
that Doug is in the other
room taking pictures

1403
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:08,384
with a real live human woman?

1404
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,619
Yes, I know, that
is his girlfriend.

1405
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:11,486
What?

1406
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,255
It's a Clarkmas miracle!

1407
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:15,692
I guess there's hope for
all of us, huh? [laughs]

1408
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:16,759
[laughs] Yeah.

1409
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,626
Oh, I'm sorry man.

1410
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:19,295
I'm so rude, Logan.

1411
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:20,463
Adler.

1412
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,965
How do you know these
troublemakers, huh?

1413
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,965
Work buddy?

1414
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:25,434
Adler is Natalie's fiance.

1415
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:26,568
[Adler] That's right.

1416
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:27,536
Nice to meet you.

1417
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,538
Have you gotten
used to it yet?

1418
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,474
Fiance?

1419
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:33,809
By the time we got used to
it, we were already married.

1420
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:35,344
Yeah, how do you know Tom?

1421
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:41,583
I've known Logan
since junior high.

1422
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:44,254
We were both in the magic club.

1423
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:45,654
He wanted to be Penn and Teller,

1424
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:47,791
but neither one of us could
agree to be the short one.

1425
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:49,926
Obviously, it's probably me.

1426
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,594
That's really funny.

1427
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:53,963
I bet you guys were so
funny in the magic club.

1428
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,766
Adler, is it?

1429
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:58,333
Yeah, that's my name.

1430
00:53:58,367 --> 00:53:59,302
[Logan] Huh.

1431
00:53:59,335 --> 00:53:59,969
[Tom] What are you working on?

1432
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:00,902
What do you do, Adler?

1433
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:01,537
I'm an attorney actually.

1434
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:02,672
Wow.

1435
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:03,873
[Adler] Pretty boring
most of the time.

1436
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:05,041
What kind of law
do you practice?

1437
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:06,541
That's professional liability

1438
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:07,976
at a mid-level firm downtown.

1439
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,446
Mid-level, huh.

1440
00:54:10,545 --> 00:54:12,547
Ah, who was it that
said, first thing we do,

1441
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:13,615
let's kill all the lawyers?

1442
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:14,750
Huh?

1443
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,352
[laughs] Shakespeare.

1444
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:17,887
Yeah, people sure do love
to bring up that quote.

1445
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,056
So I know it was
Shakespeare that said it.

1446
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,757
You don't need to
patronize me, Georgetown.

1447
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,760
Oh, actually went to Stanford.

1448
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,932
Logan, did you see we got a
photo booth set up this year?

1449
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:33,402
We always come up with some
way to outdo ourselves.

1450
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,405
Don't be mad at me.

1451
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:38,740
I didn't want to go
to law school either.

1452
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:39,909
Man, what is your problem?

1453
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,777
What are you
talking about, man?

1454
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,912
Come on.

1455
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:45,414
You want her to take
pictures, let's take pictures!

1456
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,485
Dude, I'm fine.

1457
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:50,653
You don't seem...

1458
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,488
[Man] This would
be the photo booth.

1459
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:54,724
What do you think,
this my color?

1460
00:54:54,757 --> 00:54:55,657
Is everything okay?

1461
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:56,958
Yeah, I'm great, man.

1462
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,928
We haven't talked in a
while, which is fine,

1463
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,896
but I got a promotion
in the fall.

1464
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:01,797
That's great.

1465
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,365
I'm a director now.

1466
00:55:03,398 --> 00:55:05,467
Director of technical marketing.

1467
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,536
That's a great title, right?

1468
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:07,503
- Yeah.
- It's great.

1469
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:08,371
I'm great.

1470
00:55:08,403 --> 00:55:10,106
Life is great.

1471
00:55:10,139 --> 00:55:11,407
Great.

1472
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,474
[camera clicking]

1473
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:13,675
Exactly.

1474
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,644
Aw buddy, looks
like you're the one

1475
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:16,679
that needs to lighten up, huh?

1476
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:17,780
- Here's a boa.
- Okay.

1477
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:21,318
Hey listen.

1478
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:30,459
We do not need to take
a picture right now.

1479
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,527
We need to get
one for your mom.

1480
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:34,030
Come on, she doesn't
have enough pictures.

1481
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:37,434
[laughing] He is
funny, isn't he?

1482
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:41,538
Hi Logan.

1483
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,541
I hear congratulations
are in order.

1484
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:47,609
Yes, they are.

1485
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,646
Did you just get here?

1486
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,048
Thought you would have
ghosted the party.

1487
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:53,682
Nah, I was just chatting it up

1488
00:55:53,715 --> 00:55:55,617
with good Adler
here in the kitchen.

1489
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,889
So, we have a wedding date yet?

1490
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:00,889
Huh?

1491
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:02,491
Am I on the list?

1492
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,659
No, we're going to tour
venues over the holidays

1493
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:05,027
and then we're
gonna pick a date.

1494
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:06,862
Well, I call dibs on
going to the cake tasting.

1495
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,097
That'll be awhile.

1496
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,133
Oh, speaking of tastings.

1497
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,635
Nina's invitation-only
cookies have arrived.

1498
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:14,570
If you'll excuse me.

1499
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:16,038
Oh my gosh, Nina!

1500
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,875
So, Adler.

1501
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:21,911
Adler, [laughs] you
know what they say?

1502
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,947
Never trust a guy
with two last names.

1503
00:56:25,047 --> 00:56:26,715
I think it's two
first names actually.

1504
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:27,884
[Logan] Is that right?

1505
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:28,985
Mm-hm.

1506
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,920
Huh, what do you think, Adley?

1507
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:31,820
Addie?

1508
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,190
You know what I think,

1509
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:35,791
I think I'm gonna go get
some of that famous eggnog

1510
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:36,992
that everyone
keeps talking about

1511
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:39,027
and leave you two to catch up.

1512
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,664
But Hey, really nice
talking to you, man.

1513
00:56:41,697 --> 00:56:43,865
Thanks, man.

1514
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:45,467
- Hey, speaking of eggnog.
- Yeah?

1515
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:47,570
Why don't you grab me a glass
while you're in there, huh?

1516
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:48,605
I would love to.

1517
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,942
You ghosted me, not
the other way around.

1518
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,076
Oh my God, that
was months ago.

1519
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,913
Yeah, exactly, like
eight months ago.

1520
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:58,079
But then again, who's counting?

1521
00:56:58,112 --> 00:56:59,714
Then you go and
rush into something

1522
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:00,883
and now you're
taking it out on me?

1523
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,718
I am not rushing
into anything.

1524
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:04,220
I've known Adler
since high school.

1525
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:06,521
You can't call that rushing it.

1526
00:57:06,554 --> 00:57:08,156
You can, when you're engaged.

1527
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,226
If you're so worried
I'm off the market

1528
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:13,161
then you shouldn't have
completely disappeared on me.

1529
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:14,697
I really liked you.

1530
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:17,666
And I don't know
why, but I thought

1531
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:19,234
that something real was there.

1532
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:21,637
And I know things were
moving really fast

1533
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,572
and that probably scared you...

1534
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,005
I don't need your analysis.

1535
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,576
But then you totally
dropped off the planet.

1536
00:57:26,608 --> 00:57:28,944
You should have at
least called me.

1537
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,246
You messed it up like you do.

1538
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,850
And now you see me happy
and you have to ruin it?

1539
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:36,886
I'm actually surprised you
even showed up tonight.

1540
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:38,520
I thought you'd be
too much of a coward.

1541
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:42,625
What if something
happened to me?

1542
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:44,793
What if there's an explanation?

1543
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,601
Is there?

1544
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:00,810
I'm going back inside.

1545
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:03,078
You're just angry right now

1546
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,713
because you know you're
making a mistake.

1547
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:05,981
I'm just the messenger.

1548
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:06,848
Screw you.

1549
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:08,717
You wish.

1550
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,886

1558
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:54,264
Yeah.

1559
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,866
You don't sound so
thrilled about it.

1560
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:00,003
Yeah, well,

1561
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,208
this will be my first
Christmas without my mom, so,

1562
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:09,211
I gotta be there to take
care of my dad and my sister.

1563
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,782
It's just gonna be weird.

1564
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,853
I'm, I'm really sorry.

1565
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:19,856
It is what it is.

1566
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:23,692
Everybody's got to
lose a parent sometime.

1567
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:34,636
I don't usually do this, but,

1568
00:59:37,905 --> 00:59:38,875
take another.

1569
00:59:42,777 --> 00:59:43,645
Please.

1570
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:53,722
Mm, is that sage?

1571
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:56,593
And cardamom.

1572
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:00,329
That's really good.

1573
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:02,365
Thank you.

1574
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:08,371
We should just go, you know?

1575
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:09,704
I don't...

1576
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:11,039
Okay, we can go if you want,

1577
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:13,208
but don't let that guy
make you leave a party

1578
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,343
that you want to stay at.

1579
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:16,245
I don't really
want to stay anymore.

1580
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:17,679
Okay.

1581
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:18,414
There you guys are.

1582
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:19,981
We're gonna do a group photo.

1583
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:21,283
That way Tom and I will know
we're at the same party.

1584
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,085
You good?

1585
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:24,152
Yeah, I'm fine.

1586
01:00:24,186 --> 01:00:25,388
You coming?

1587
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:26,321
Yeah

1588
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:30,893
I found them, okay,
everybody get in here.

1589
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:33,362
We have props, not optional.

1590
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:34,896
- Let's get them out.
- My idea.

1591
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:35,864
It was my idea.

1592
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,099
Yeah, yeah, Tom's idea.

1593
01:00:37,132 --> 01:00:39,969
Oh, mistletoe for the lovers.

1594
01:00:40,001 --> 01:00:41,903
- Nina, this is you.
- Yeah.

1595
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:44,106
- Obviously.
- Gingerbread!

1596
01:00:45,407 --> 01:00:48,177
Okay, and, you ready?

1597
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:51,881
One, two, three.

1598
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,249
[All] Clarkmas!

1599
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:57,153
- All right.
- Awesome.

1600
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,387
Hope I didn't
blink in that one.

1601
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,454
It was so great
to see you again.

1602
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:00,422
Yes, take care.

1603
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:01,390
We will see you next Clarkmas.

1604
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:03,024
Next Clarkmas, it's a date.

1605
01:01:03,057 --> 01:01:04,994
Your gingerbread, woo!

1606
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:06,429
I can't wait for next year.

1607
01:01:09,164 --> 01:01:11,100
Yeah, there's still food.

1608
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:12,333
Oh.

1609
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,137
- Oh yeah, help yourself.
- Feel free.

1610
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,706
- Okay.
- Okay.

1611
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,141
All right, okay.

1612
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:19,876
We did it.

1613
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:29,419
[Tom festively humming]

1614
01:01:34,222 --> 01:01:35,724
[Annie] Shouldn't
have bothered.

1615
01:01:35,757 --> 01:01:37,960
I'll put it all up,
I don't need any help.

1616
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:38,960
You're dead weight.

1617
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:42,797
Clarkmas isn't
happening this year.

1618
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,467
You're being dramatic.

1619
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,034
I am never dramatic.

1620
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:48,904
We could still have a party.

1621
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:51,106
This year sucks.

1622
01:01:52,206 --> 01:01:53,241
We're having a baby.

1623
01:01:54,842 --> 01:01:57,879
I have been barfing for the
last eight months straight.

1624
01:01:57,913 --> 01:01:59,081
There were a couple
of weeks in there

1625
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:00,849
where you didn't
barf quite as much.

1626
01:02:00,882 --> 01:02:03,185
All my pants feel
like I'm wearing Spanx.

1627
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:08,790
You think I'll be a good dad?

1628
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,026
You'll be the best dad.

1629
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,962
I'm being serious.

1630
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:15,931
I am serious, you'll be
the best dad there ever was.

1631
01:02:15,963 --> 01:02:18,467
But you can't tell either
of our fathers I said that.

1632
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:23,172
I'm gonna be the good cop.

1633
01:02:23,204 --> 01:02:24,507
That makes me the bad cop.

1634
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:26,407
Well, either that or
we're both good cops

1635
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,942
and we raise a criminal.

1636
01:02:27,976 --> 01:02:30,211
Well, that might
happen anyway.

1637
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:33,114
[doorbell ringing]

1638
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:35,351
If we don't make noise,
maybe they'll go away.

1639
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:36,519
You're being ridiculous.

1640
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,120
It's probably a Boppy
or some other thing

1641
01:02:38,152 --> 01:02:39,755
your mom insisted on ordering.

1642
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:45,927
Impromptu Clarkmas?

1643
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,564
I knew if I called, Annie
would say not to come over.

1644
01:02:49,597 --> 01:02:50,500
You're right!

1645
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:54,170
But it's too late now,
so you have to let me in.

1646
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:55,938
[Annie] Is that true?

1647
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:57,072
Yes, come in.

1648
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,012
I come bearing gifts.

1649
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,547
Well, unless your
gift is a flat stomach

1650
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,981
and a painless delivery,
I'm not interested.

1651
01:03:07,014 --> 01:03:08,416
She's been like
this all month.

1652
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:10,552
[Annie] Don't
mansplain your wife.

1653
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,387
That's not mansplaining.

1654
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,989
Oh, I'm sorry,

1655
01:03:14,021 --> 01:03:16,125
would you like to explain
to me what mansplaining is?

1656
01:03:16,157 --> 01:03:18,326
Actually, I
think Tom is right.

1657
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,930
He was simply complaining.

1658
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,432
You're embarking on a
brand new adventure.

1659
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,201
The next chapter.

1660
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:26,902
She's not the only one.

1661
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:28,403
Oh right, excuse me, Tom.

1662
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:29,538
You too.

1663
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:30,739
But you too, Nat.

1664
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:33,842
If the timing's right, this
could be baby's first wedding.

1665
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:36,110
About that.

1666
01:03:36,143 --> 01:03:37,346
[Annie] Oh God, what?

1667
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:39,214
Oh, don't say it like that.

1668
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:42,351
Well, what were you gonna say?

1669
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,589
Adler and I are
calling it off.

1670
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,858
What?

1671
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,059
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

1672
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,994
No, no, it's fine.

1673
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:54,929
It's, yeah, I'm fine.

1674
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:59,101
It's ah, yeah, we're both fine.

1675
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:01,003
How'd it happen?

1676
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:01,871
Tom!

1677
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:05,140
How did it happen?

1678
01:04:05,172 --> 01:04:10,178
Well, it was very
mature, actually.

1679
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,214
Extremely.

1680
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:14,582
We had just had dinner at
his dad and step-mom's house

1681
01:04:14,615 --> 01:04:15,516
for Thanksgiving.

1682
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,052
And that went great, by the way.

1683
01:04:17,085 --> 01:04:18,987
They are very lovely people.

1684
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:23,291
But we were, you know,
done with dinner,

1685
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:25,660
on the way to the
airport, and we were stuck

1686
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:28,130
in this crappy
rental car, you know,

1687
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:31,333
crawling our way towards O'Hare.

1688
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:34,936
And I picked this
moment for some reason,

1689
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:38,072
in horrible traffic,
to turn to him and say,

1690
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:41,310
this is never gonna
work, you know?

1691
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:45,648
He was so weird and
quiet after I said it.

1692
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,081
Maybe because of the shock

1693
01:04:47,114 --> 01:04:49,184
or maybe because
he agreed with me.

1694
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:55,157
So I just rambled on about how
we were really great friends,

1695
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:58,193
but that we were never in love.

1696
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,232
And we really enjoyed
each other's company,

1697
01:05:04,266 --> 01:05:07,503
but it wasn't
electric or something.

1698
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:17,679
And of course an
accident is ahead.

1699
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:22,351
So we are stuck in this
bumper to bumper traffic,

1700
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:26,389
followed by an
airplane ride to LA.

1701
01:05:29,224 --> 01:05:32,227
Definitely should have
waited till after you landed.

1702
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,064
And then we, we
talked about, you know,

1703
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:39,500
what to do, you know,
how to figure it all out.

1704
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:44,206
But funny thing is we're
supposed to fly back

1705
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,608
for Christmas Eve with
my parents and his mom

1706
01:05:47,641 --> 01:05:49,277
and his two brothers.

1707
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:50,679
And we haven't told them yet.

1708
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:53,181
Nobody knows, and we're
supposed to fly tomorrow.

1709
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:57,318
And I just feel like my mom is
gonna be really upset. [sobs]

1710
01:05:57,351 --> 01:05:59,020
Now I have all of this
tacky wedding shit

1711
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:00,456
that I really don't need.

1712
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,389
Oh honey.

1713
01:06:01,422 --> 01:06:02,590
That's what E-bay is for.

1714
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,026
Not for monogram napkins.

1715
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:06,195
No, Yeah.

1716
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,463
That's gonna be
tough to get rid of.

1717
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,234
It's okay.

1718
01:06:15,103 --> 01:06:17,639
[festive music]

1719
01:06:18,672 --> 01:06:20,108
Oh, all right.

1720
01:06:20,141 --> 01:06:22,377
I found the last
box of decorations.

1721
01:06:23,344 --> 01:06:25,680
Who wants to help me decorate?

1722
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:27,482
Is this gonna hold this up?

1723
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,384
Oh yeah.

1724
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,754
This mantle was born
to house some acorns.

1725
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:35,057
Those are pine cones, Tom.

1726
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:35,724
Huh?

1727
01:06:35,757 --> 01:06:36,625
Pine cones.

1728
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:39,260
You need to center it first.

1729
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:41,362
Don't pull the tape
until you have a centered

1730
01:06:41,396 --> 01:06:42,364
and know where you want it.

1731
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:43,231
Okay, tape's ready to go.

1732
01:06:43,264 --> 01:06:44,766
One step, two step.

1733
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,336
A little high, Natalie, a
little lower on your side.

1734
01:06:47,369 --> 01:06:48,269
That's what I was thinking.

1735
01:06:48,302 --> 01:06:49,070
Where are you gonna tape it?

1736
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,038
I don't know.

1737
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,340
Wherever you tell us.

1738
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:52,374
That's good.

1739
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:53,375
That's good.

1740
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:54,242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1741
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,143
Great.

1742
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,246
[garland clattering]

1743
01:06:57,278 --> 01:06:59,547
[Annie laughing]

1744
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:02,117
Tom, it's not here.

1745
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:03,586
Did you finish the last of it?

1746
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:06,788
Guilty.

1747
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:07,756
Are you serious?

1748
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:09,625
It's hot chocolate season.

1749
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:10,525
I'll go get some.

1750
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,661
No, you don't have to.

1751
01:07:12,693 --> 01:07:13,862
Are you kidding me?

1752
01:07:13,894 --> 01:07:17,365
I'm gonna go down to that store
and I'm gonna track it down.

1753
01:07:17,398 --> 01:07:19,134
I'm gonna find your
most very favorite brand

1754
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:23,172
and we are having hot chocolate
whether you like it or not.

1755
01:07:23,204 --> 01:07:24,306
Thank you.

1756
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:25,440
[Tom] I think
you're gonna like it.

1757
01:07:27,775 --> 01:07:29,210
Tom's lucky to have you.

1758
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,147
Yeah, I'm pretty
lucky to have him too.

1759
01:07:34,382 --> 01:07:36,318
Just crazy to think how
it's all gonna change

1760
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:38,186
in a matter of weeks.

1761
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:39,221
Or less.

1762
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:40,422
Could be early.

1763
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,391
Please don't say that.

1764
01:07:42,423 --> 01:07:44,460
Seriously though, I
mean, people always assume

1765
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:47,161
that the first is late,
but my college roommate,

1766
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:48,564
she had her baby
three weeks early.

1767
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,599
Well, I'd rather
not think about that.

1768
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,836
But I do think that you
should pack a to-go bag

1769
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:56,170
or something, or
whatever they call it.

1770
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:57,840
Can you just stop?

1771
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,441
It's like the second
one you get pregnant,

1772
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:01,610
that's all people want
to talk to you about.

1773
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,085
Adler's a stupid
name, by the way.

1774
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,688
It is.

1775
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:13,688
[both laughing]

1776
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:14,857
- It is.
- Total deal breaker.

1777
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:16,591
You really dodged
bullet on that one.

1778
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,792
Thank you.

1779
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:20,895
Yeah, if only that
was the only flaw.

1780
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,631
He was so boring.

1781
01:08:24,698 --> 01:08:26,234
Like milk toast.

1782
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,171
Like I Ken doll, but
with less personality.

1783
01:08:29,203 --> 01:08:31,739
[both laughing]

1784
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,510
What was I thinking?

1785
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,481
Ah, you want some more music?

1786
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:40,349
Would that be nice?

1787
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:41,483
Yeah, sure.

1788
01:08:45,854 --> 01:08:47,422
What you putting on?

1789
01:08:47,454 --> 01:08:49,125
Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

1790
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:54,362
[Jazzy music]

1791
01:08:54,395 --> 01:08:55,264
Okay, all right.

1792
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,603
Go Annie, go Annie.

1793
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:03,639
[both laughing]

1794
01:09:03,671 --> 01:09:05,439
Don't laugh at me!

1795
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:06,774
I'm liking it.

1796
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,180
I don't know, this is my
idea of a party these days.

1797
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:12,280
I guess so.

1798
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,283
You sad you didn't
have your party?

1799
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,287
Yeah, sure.

1800
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,322
But you know, we didn't
know how I'd be feeling

1801
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:21,789
or if the baby would come early.

1802
01:09:21,823 --> 01:09:23,759
So it didn't make
sense this year.

1803
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,161
It was the right choice.

1804
01:09:26,293 --> 01:09:27,729
You can still
be bummed though.

1805
01:09:28,863 --> 01:09:30,798
The party's never
gonna be the same.

1806
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:33,402
Our lives aren't
gonna be the same.

1807
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,303
That is true.

1808
01:09:35,703 --> 01:09:36,637
Don't say that.

1809
01:09:36,671 --> 01:09:37,940
Well, it is true though.

1810
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:40,341
I mean, you're
starting a new chapter.

1811
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,409
You should be excited.

1812
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,677
But if I had known last year

1813
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,213
was gonna be the last
year we had the party.

1814
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,382
Annie, I think you're being
a little dramatic right now.

1815
01:09:47,414 --> 01:09:48,550
You don't get it.

1816
01:09:48,582 --> 01:09:50,351
You still have your
life ahead of you.

1817
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:51,686
But with every
choice that I make,

1818
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,521
it's like I'm saying
goodbye to the life I have.

1819
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:54,957
And I really like my life.

1820
01:09:54,989 --> 01:09:56,958
Well then why don't you
be a little more like me,

1821
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:59,261
and avoid every choice
that you could make?

1822
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:00,229
I didn't mean...

1823
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,896
You have it all, and
here you are complaining

1824
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,298
about checking off your
next life achievement?

1825
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:05,367
That's not what I was saying.

1826
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:06,367
Then what are you saying?

1827
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,502
That you have a perfect
life and a perfect baby?

1828
01:10:08,536 --> 01:10:09,904
Poor you.

1829
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:11,907
It's just really hard when
you see everyone around you

1830
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:13,875
doing all the things
that you want to do,

1831
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:16,578
and you realize it might not
ever be in the cards for you.

1832
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,012
Natalie?

1833
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:18,847
That's why I said yes to
Adler in the first place,

1834
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,349
you know?

1835
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:21,382
To go down the path
and join the club.

1836
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:22,583
Natalie?

1837
01:10:22,617 --> 01:10:23,985
There's no point in
going down the path

1838
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,887
just because you're afraid
you have an expiration date.

1839
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:30,725
Annie?

1840
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:31,659
Annie!

1841
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,995
I'm pretty sure that
was a contraction.

1842
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,329
[Natalie] What?

1843
01:10:34,362 --> 01:10:35,864
I am pretty sure
that was a contraction.

1844
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:37,265
What do I do?

1845
01:10:37,298 --> 01:10:37,932
You need to, you
need to time it.

1846
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:38,600
You need to get a timer.

1847
01:10:38,632 --> 01:10:39,934
Okay.

1848
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:40,801
[door creaking]
It's timing, it's timing.

1849
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:42,704
It was an impulse buy!

1850
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:48,043
Oh!

1851
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,746
Yeah, the last one was
about 10 minutes ago.

1852
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,414
Okay.

1853
01:10:52,447 --> 01:10:53,882
Yeah, she's drinking
water already.

1854
01:10:53,914 --> 01:10:55,516
So that's great.

1855
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,820
Now do I need to call before
we leave or can I just go?

1856
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,021
Okay.

1857
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,423
And do I personally need
to bring extra clothes?

1858
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:03,425
Of course not, okay.

1859
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:04,659
Oh, okay, thank you.

1860
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:06,494
Okay, what?

1861
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,396
So do we go now?

1862
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,596
We need to wait.

1863
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,898
They need to be less
than 10 minutes apart

1864
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:10,798
for an hour straight.

1865
01:11:10,832 --> 01:11:12,768
An hour straight?

1866
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,436
Oh my God.

1867
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,676
I'm going to take a bath.

1868
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,542
Great idea.

1869
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:22,511
Do you need me?

1870
01:11:22,543 --> 01:11:23,679
You've already done enough.

1871
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:27,915
Never have children.

1872
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:30,519
Right.

1873
01:11:38,426 --> 01:11:39,895
Who's ready for hot chocolate?

1874
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:52,007
Do you need to talk
about the Adler stuff?

1875
01:11:52,039 --> 01:11:53,074
No.

1876
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,777
Annie exhausted that topic.

1877
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:58,780
Because if you wanted to
talk about it, I'm here.

1878
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,859
Is Annie okay?

1879
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:13,595
Aside from the human trying
to claw its way out of her?

1880
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:15,864
You know what I mean.

1881
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:20,536
She doesn't like the
thing she can't control.

1882
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:27,775
I ordered myself a
Nintendo Switch last night.

1883
01:12:27,809 --> 01:12:28,711
Oh.

1884
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:32,012
I'm supposed to
be an adult now,

1885
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:37,052
but it feels like the closer
we get, the more I revert.

1886
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:43,424
You don't have to say anything.

1887
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:45,027
I think I just needed
to tell somebody.

1888
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:50,966
I peeked into the nursery
on my way to the bathroom.

1889
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,002
It's perfect.

1890
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:55,470
[Tom] You think so?

1891
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,371
Mm-hm.

1892
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:01,009
Logan came over last week
to help assemble the crib.

1893
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,010
There are a lot of pieces.

1894
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:02,978
They're confusing.

1895
01:13:03,978 --> 01:13:05,579
How is he?

1896
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:06,481
Logan?

1897
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:09,885
Good, yeah.

1898
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:11,052
Feel a lot better.

1899
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,989
Doing some traveling with work,
going to some cool places.

1900
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:18,159
Sort of seeing someone.

1901
01:13:20,795 --> 01:13:22,530
Wow, good for him.

1902
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:24,533
[Tom] Yeah.

1903
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:27,802
Have you met her?

1904
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,570
Yeah, actually.

1905
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:31,606
She hosted a game
night back in October.

1906
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,577
That I won.

1907
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,946
Wow.

1908
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,481
That's really cool for him.

1909
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:44,786
Is that Doug?

1910
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:46,188
Doug is getting married?

1911
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,054
[Tom] Yeah.

1912
01:13:47,087 --> 01:13:48,122
You remember Katrina?

1913
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:51,059
Wow.

1914
01:13:51,091 --> 01:13:52,427
Isn't that great?

1915
01:13:54,695 --> 01:13:57,198
What, I can mean it and
still feel sorry for myself.

1916
01:13:58,099 --> 01:13:58,934
[Tom] Okay.

1917
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,570
That's just the case.

1918
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,211
These really don't show how
long this all takes, do they?

1919
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:11,546
You're telling me.

1920
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,653
Don't you dare take a
picture of me in this state.

1921
01:14:18,685 --> 01:14:19,653
It's Clarkmas.

1922
01:14:19,686 --> 01:14:21,155
This is not Clarkmas.

1923
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:22,990
Oh, who says that it isn't?

1924
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:25,527
Tom, lean in.

1925
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,261
She's only getting
half your head.

1926
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:27,128
Yeah.

1927
01:14:28,128 --> 01:14:29,597
Oh!

1928
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:30,699
Say cheese.

1929
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:31,832
[All] Cheese.

1930
01:14:31,865 --> 01:14:33,902
[camera clicking]

1931
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:34,803
Oh.

1932
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:36,738
Can I see?

1933
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:38,474
- Big, happy family.
- Ah.

1934
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,277
Annie do...

1935
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,778
That's the worst picture of
me in the history of photos.

1936
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,112
That is not true.

1937
01:14:45,145 --> 01:14:46,514
Let's do another one.

1938
01:14:46,547 --> 01:14:47,181
Say baby.

1939
01:14:47,215 --> 01:14:48,083
[All] Baby.

1940
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,753
[Annie groans]

1941
01:14:53,688 --> 01:14:56,225
[festive music]

1942
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:02,863
Tom, what was that?

1943
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:05,567
[Tom] Nothing, it's all good.

1944
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,302
It didn't sound like nothing.

1945
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,837
[Tom] Broken glass
never really hurt anyone.

1946
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:10,639
I won't fall for
that old trick.

1947
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:13,307
[baby crying]

1948
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:14,943
Oh, you woke her up.

1949
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:17,612
Yeah, that definitely
wasn't you calling to me

1950
01:15:17,645 --> 01:15:18,647
from the other room?

1951
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,018
Do you wanna get
her or should I?

1952
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,619
I'm on it.

1953
01:15:24,652 --> 01:15:26,922
Oh, I have a stockpile
of bottles in the fridge.

1954
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:29,291
I pumped extra so I can
have a drink tonight.

1955
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:31,759
Oh, cheers to you.

1956
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,761
[doorbell ringing]

1957
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:34,930
I'll get it.

1958
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,766
Oh, we made it.

1959
01:15:37,798 --> 01:15:40,769
I didn't think Hudson
was gonna cooperate.

1960
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:43,271
Follow him.

1961
01:15:45,372 --> 01:15:47,841
It is a wonder we ever
got out of the house.

1962
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,610
Don't ever have a second child.

1963
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:57,219
[festive music]

1964
01:16:01,288 --> 01:16:02,122
[electricity crackling]

1965
01:16:02,155 --> 01:16:05,027
[child screaming]

1966
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,564
[guests chattering]

1967
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:17,338
Hello Miss Eloise!

1968
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,240
Merry Christmas.

1969
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,943
I thought I'd be the first
one here, it's tradition.

1970
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:23,978
We started early
for the family crowd.

1971
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:25,814
Are you enjoying the party?

1972
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:26,880
[Annie] Can you say hi?

1973
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:27,782
- Hi.
- Hi!

1974
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:30,217
I'm so glad you came.

1975
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:31,886
Why wouldn't I?

1976
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:34,622
It's just nice to see
someone without a diaper bag.

1977
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:35,990
No diapers here.

1978
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:38,158
You want to hold that clicker?

1979
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:39,360
Oh my.

1980
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:41,096
You think you can
push the button?

1981
01:16:42,829 --> 01:16:43,664
Can you take the picture?

1982
01:16:43,698 --> 01:16:44,365
Okay, let's try it.

1983
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,767
Woo!

1984
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,702
[all laughing]

1985
01:16:47,734 --> 01:16:49,304
Good job!

1986
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:51,806
Tom Decided to set up
drinks out back this year.

1987
01:16:51,838 --> 01:16:53,841
So grab yourself a drink
and I'll be right back.

1988
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,777
I'm just gonna help
him put down Eloise.

1989
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:02,783
These are amazing.

1990
01:17:02,817 --> 01:17:03,784
Oh, thank you.

1991
01:17:03,818 --> 01:17:04,719
Thank you.

1992
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:05,787
My son, my son got them for me.

1993
01:17:05,819 --> 01:17:06,987
[Katy] Hudson?

1994
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,088
Hudson, yeah,
he's a sweetheart.

1995
01:17:08,122 --> 01:17:10,225
But aggressive sometimes.

1996
01:17:10,257 --> 01:17:13,394
But what I'm saying is that
aggression isn't innately bad.

1997
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,162
My mother-in-law keeps undoing

1998
01:17:15,195 --> 01:17:16,797
everything we've been working on

1999
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:19,668
and she's staying three
weeks this Christmas.

2000
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,668
[Jamie] Oh my God.

2001
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:22,237
[Katy] Yay for me.

2002
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:25,840
I don't think we've
met yet, I'm Natalie.

2003
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:26,974
Annie's cousin.

2004
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:27,841
Oh, that's so
sweet of you to come.

2005
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:29,344
Great outfit.

2006
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,245
Thanks.

2007
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,780
And what do you do?

2008
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:34,815
I'm a psychologist.

2009
01:17:34,849 --> 01:17:36,885
Wow, that's so neat.

2010
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:37,851
Thanks.

2011
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:38,853
Yeah, I really like it.

2012
01:17:38,886 --> 01:17:41,823
I wasn't sure I'd find
my place in the field,

2013
01:17:41,855 --> 01:17:43,757
but I'm very happy.

2014
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:45,894
You must have
your life together.

2015
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:47,194
[scoffs] No.

2016
01:17:47,228 --> 01:17:48,195
Everybody knows that therapists

2017
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,231
are the worst at relationships.

2018
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,169
What do you do?

2019
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,302
I'm a divorce attorney.

2020
01:17:56,804 --> 01:18:00,141
[children yelling]

2021
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:01,876
[Megan] That seems aggressive.

2022
01:18:01,908 --> 01:18:03,310
I'm not playing!

2023
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,147
Hello, hello!

2024
01:18:07,114 --> 01:18:08,215
Hot Mama!

2025
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:09,384
Nina, you made it!

2026
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:14,456
And I brought my best sellers,
the holiday macaroon trio,

2027
01:18:14,488 --> 01:18:17,125
gingerbread, peppermint,
spiced eggnog.

2028
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:17,993
Oh!

2029
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:21,229
Is it gauche if I put out
business cards next to them?

2030
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:22,262
Oh my God, I love it.

2031
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:23,865
Let me see.

2032
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:27,402
Oh, my mom friends are gonna
flip when they see these.

2033
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:29,237
You were going to be doing
every child's birthday party

2034
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,371
for the next 18 years.

2035
01:18:30,404 --> 01:18:31,339
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

2036
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,442
Yeah, that's the spirit.

2037
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:37,077
We're leaving
tomorrow for New York.

2038
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:42,117
Red eye is the only way to
get Hudson across the country.

2039
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:44,853
We've avoided
any flights so far.

2040
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:46,521
I made everyone come to us.

2041
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:48,856
Yeah, but that won't
last forever, man.

2042
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,392
Knock knock, the
party can start now.

2043
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:52,360
[Tom] Hey!

2044
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:53,895
Hey!

2045
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:56,363
I still miss just walking
across the hallway

2046
01:18:56,396 --> 01:18:58,932
to get to your party.

2047
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:00,135
At least you
don't have to worry

2048
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,869
about us burning your
place down with ours.

2049
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,372
[laughs] Where's the baby?

2050
01:19:04,404 --> 01:19:06,006
I'm really good with kids.

2051
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:07,307
We actually just put her down,

2052
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:09,978
but I am sure she'll
be up again soon.

2053
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,146
Hey, is that your car

2054
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:12,780
with the Baby on
Board sticker on it?

2055
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:13,847
No, we're the Prius.

2056
01:19:13,881 --> 01:19:15,250
Oh good, good.

2057
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,018
Because I really resent
those Baby on Board cars.

2058
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,419
I just don't get it, you know?

2059
01:19:18,452 --> 01:19:19,921
It's like, what are
they trying to say?

2060
01:19:19,953 --> 01:19:22,322
Like don't hit my car
because I have a kid?

2061
01:19:22,355 --> 01:19:24,458
All right, I won't do it.

2062
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:26,394
They suddenly want me
to be a good driver

2063
01:19:26,426 --> 01:19:29,329
to avoid hitting
this stranger's brat.

2064
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:31,365
Or they're just bragging
about having a kid,

2065
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,534
which is not really impressive.

2066
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:33,467
A lot of people have kids.

2067
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:34,569
Rats have kids.

2068
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:36,069
Rats have a lot of kids.

2069
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:37,270
There's just the kids
all over the place.

2070
01:19:37,304 --> 01:19:39,807
They could be having kids right
under this floor right now.

2071
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,309
Anyone could have a kid, right?

2072
01:19:49,182 --> 01:19:50,318
It's my car actually.

2073
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:55,255
Cool.

2074
01:19:55,288 --> 01:19:56,190
That's cool.

2075
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:57,292
No, it's real cool.

2076
01:19:57,324 --> 01:19:58,425
I like a good Honda.

2077
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:02,229
That's a good sturdy,
sturdy vehicle.

2078
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:05,199
Good reliable, reliable car.

2079
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,135
This is Mike.

2080
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,268
Mike.

2081
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:09,136
Cliff.

2082
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,438
Cliff.

2083
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,305
Rats?

2084
01:20:11,338 --> 01:20:12,207
Yeah.

2085
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:16,144
Babe, just because
your parents are visiting

2086
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:18,045
doesn't mean I have to
be on good behavior.

2087
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:19,447
They're sleeping
in the living room,

2088
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,181
you can't play video games
while they're in there.

2089
01:20:21,215 --> 01:20:22,050
I am very quiet.

2090
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:23,917
Not when you lose.

2091
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:24,853
[doorbell ringing]

2092
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,020
I'm gonna get the door.

2093
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:28,323
First of all, I rarely lose.

2094
01:20:28,355 --> 01:20:31,125
Second of all, I wear a headset.

2095
01:20:31,158 --> 01:20:34,128
You know how I know you lost
three campaigns last night?

2096
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:37,298
I heard you lose three
campaigns last night.

2097
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:40,301
Oh, hello.

2098
01:20:41,502 --> 01:20:46,240
Hey, it's nice to see you.

2099
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,579
Come on in.

2100
01:20:51,612 --> 01:20:55,048
Just fill it with sugar water,
the hummingbirds love that.

2101
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:57,619
Oh, I just did that actually.

2102
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:58,485
Hey buddy.

2103
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:00,221
Hey!

2104
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,524
How you doing?

2105
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:05,393
Been a while.

2106
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:06,261
Good to see you.

2107
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:07,427
You too.

2108
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:08,630
Why don't I take
this into the kitchen?

2109
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:09,530
As long as I get
the credit for it.

2110
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:12,967
That sweater's ridiculous.

2111
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,967
You know that, right?

2112
01:21:14,001 --> 01:21:14,936
You don't like this sweater?

2113
01:21:14,969 --> 01:21:15,569
I didn't say didn't like it,

2114
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:16,404
I said it's ridiculous.

2115
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:19,640
Another bottle to
add to the stash.

2116
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:20,608
Ooh.

2117
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,109
It's from Logan, actually.

2118
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:23,377
This one's fancy.

2119
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,345
I know.

2120
01:21:24,377 --> 01:21:25,947
The party is a huge success.

2121
01:21:25,979 --> 01:21:27,314
You think so?

2122
01:21:27,347 --> 01:21:29,182
My catty mommy and me
friends left a little early.

2123
01:21:29,216 --> 01:21:30,351
But that's because their kid

2124
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,252
almost gave that other
kid a concussion.

2125
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:34,521
Hudson, he's a maniac.

2126
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:36,124
They have another
shot with the sister,

2127
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,292
so far she seems sweet.

2128
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:39,159
I don't know,
that's debatable.

2129
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:40,662
Yeah. [laughs]

2130
01:21:40,694 --> 01:21:42,996
But it's good that
you had the party.

2131
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:44,465
Well, why wouldn't I?

2132
01:21:44,497 --> 01:21:47,134
I just thought you
might not want it now.

2133
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:48,670
Well, things may be different,

2134
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,672
but some things never change.

2135
01:21:50,704 --> 01:21:52,573
I hope it hasn't been
too boring for you.

2136
01:21:52,605 --> 01:21:55,175
No, I've never been
more excited to see Cliff,

2137
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:57,045
but watching him offend
your new friends,

2138
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:59,314
it's like a sport
in itself, really.

2139
01:21:59,346 --> 01:22:02,516
Oh, could you grab Tom to
do the chestnuts with me?

2140
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,118
It's his project this year.

2141
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,621
We are roasting
chestnuts for the party.

2142
01:22:06,654 --> 01:22:08,089
Nice.

2143
01:22:08,122 --> 01:22:10,158
I got a special pan. [laughs]

2144
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:11,259
[Natalie] That's a cool pan.

2145
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:12,126
It is.

2146
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:13,293
I'll get Tom.

2147
01:22:13,327 --> 01:22:14,195
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

2148
01:22:14,228 --> 01:22:15,096
Go.

2149
01:22:16,697 --> 01:22:19,667
[camera clicking]

2150
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:20,568
Perfect.

2151
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,136
That was great.

2152
01:22:25,605 --> 01:22:27,509
You know, mistletoe
is parasitic.

2153
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:33,181
Well, would you look at
that, some you and me time

2154
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:34,315
at one of our parties.

2155
01:22:39,552 --> 01:22:41,555
Well about about that.

2156
01:22:43,757 --> 01:22:45,460
People could
walk in, you know.

2157
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,228
Then let them
walk in and watch.

2158
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:52,533
[chestnut clanging]

2159
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:54,001
What was that?

2160
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,737
[chestnuts clanging]

2161
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,338
We were supposed
to cut them first!

2162
01:22:57,371 --> 01:22:58,206
Oh!

2163
01:22:58,238 --> 01:22:59,206
Oh, you're right.

2164
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:00,640
Okay, grab a, grab a shield.

2165
01:23:00,673 --> 01:23:01,509
Protect yourself.

2166
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,078
They're coming down hard.

2167
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:04,746
Stay alive.

2168
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,180
Oh gosh. [shrieks]

2169
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:07,648
[Tom] Watch your
face, I'm going in.

2170
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:16,591
You look pretty
lonely out here.

2171
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,061
Is that your
diagnosis, doctor?

2172
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,130
Yes, I will have my
secretary bill you.

2173
01:23:24,798 --> 01:23:25,800
How's the party?

2174
01:23:27,534 --> 01:23:29,636
There's only so many
conversations you can have

2175
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:33,541
about daycare and sleep
training, but c'est la vie.

2176
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:34,442
La vie.

2177
01:23:35,609 --> 01:23:38,379
So what's your news?

2178
01:23:38,412 --> 01:23:40,148
What's new in the
world of Logan?

2179
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:43,117
I bought a condo in the fall.

2180
01:23:43,149 --> 01:23:46,620
Wow, congratulations!

2181
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:49,257
That's, that's adulting!

2182
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:51,391
My dad helped me
with the down payment.

2183
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:52,659
[Natalie] Still amazing.

2184
01:23:53,726 --> 01:23:54,595
And you?

2185
01:23:55,796 --> 01:23:58,166
Ugh, so I have to try
and impress you now?

2186
01:23:58,198 --> 01:23:59,433
It's just conversation.

2187
01:24:00,734 --> 01:24:04,439
Well, if you've read
my family Christmas card,

2188
01:24:04,471 --> 01:24:07,541
you'd know that I took up piano,

2189
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:11,378
traveled to Spain and
joined a mid-sized practice

2190
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:15,249
taking care of at-risk
children and teens.

2191
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:17,385
They're not really
at risk per se,

2192
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:19,420
but my mom wanted it
to sound important.

2193
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,322
I need to get on this
Christmas card list.

2194
01:24:22,355 --> 01:24:23,824
Some years she writes a poem.

2195
01:24:25,592 --> 01:24:27,194
She retired three years ago.

2196
01:24:31,431 --> 01:24:35,469
Hey, I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Adler.

2197
01:24:35,502 --> 01:24:36,636
You remember his name.

2198
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:37,838
It's good you two
broke up though.

2199
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,207
Now listen, hear me out.

2200
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:42,143
You two are both so good-looking

2201
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:44,645
that your children would come
out abnormally good looking,

2202
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:47,247
like so symmetrical
that it's weird.

2203
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,583
[laughs] What?

2204
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:50,618
Here's that laugh.

2205
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,124
Would it be rude for me to ask
what happened with you two?

2206
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,625
Yes, incredibly.

2207
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:04,498
You know when a ship
steers too far to one side,

2208
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,601
and then it overcompensates
in the other direction?

2209
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:10,872
I guess I was so critical of
everyone that I had been dating

2210
01:25:10,904 --> 01:25:15,109
that I completely ignored
the red flags with Adler.

2211
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,613
And eventually I
woke up and realized

2212
01:25:18,645 --> 01:25:20,380
that I was never
in love with him.

2213
01:25:22,216 --> 01:25:24,552
I'm glad you realized how
critical you were of me.

2214
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,427
I did want to say I'm sorry.

2215
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:37,431
I was a real dick and
I messed things up.

2216
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:40,467
Which dick thing
are you referring to?

2217
01:25:45,471 --> 01:25:50,478
I really liked you
and it terrified me.

2218
01:25:52,412 --> 01:25:55,382
And then when all the stuff
started happening with my mom,

2219
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:59,887
she got sick and I
just, I closed off.

2220
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,855
I just disappeared.

2221
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:02,923
And everything started
to snowball and I just,

2222
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,859
I shut everyone out.

2223
01:26:04,891 --> 01:26:06,626
And by the time she
passed, I just felt

2224
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:09,630
like too much time had
gone by for me to call you.

2225
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:12,466
I know it sounds stupid,

2226
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,902
but I thought maybe I
could explain everything

2227
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:19,941
at their party, but then I
showed up and you were engaged.

2228
01:26:26,913 --> 01:26:31,219
And I just felt like I,
if I told you everything,

2229
01:26:34,555 --> 01:26:36,224
I didn't want to
ruin your engagement.

2230
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,826
Okay, maybe I did, a little.

2231
01:26:43,896 --> 01:26:48,536
Look, I said, I liked
you in the past tense,

2232
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:51,239
but the truth is
I still like you.

2233
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,843
Does it help at all if I say

2234
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:57,712
that I've been
meaning to call you?

2235
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:04,751
Come on, you can't
just be silent.

2236
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,725
[Tom] We're getting
ready for the photo booth,

2237
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:11,759
get in here.

2238
01:27:13,426 --> 01:27:15,362
We better get inside.

2239
01:27:16,796 --> 01:27:19,000
Did you hear
anything I just said?

2240
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:19,901
I did.

2241
01:27:21,335 --> 01:27:22,869
and I, I appreciate it.

2242
01:27:26,372 --> 01:27:30,244
But Logan, I just, I can't.

2243
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:36,384
We already gave it a chance.

2244
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:38,452
I'm really sorry.

2245
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,432
So we're all in it together.

2246
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:56,537
Squeeze uncomfortably close.

2247
01:27:56,569 --> 01:27:58,038
Okay.

2248
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,608
One, two, three.

2249
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,942
[All] Clarkmas!

2250
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:04,512
Yay!

2251
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:05,645
Hey, thank you everybody.

2252
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:06,614
Thank you.

2253
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:07,814
You can go back to the party.

2254
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:09,050
Thank you for doing your duty.

2255
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:12,019
Drinks, food, we
still have food.

2256
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,692
So I saw you guys
outside chatting.

2257
01:28:18,725 --> 01:28:19,661
How'd that go?

2258
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:22,596
It was nice, man.

2259
01:28:22,628 --> 01:28:24,931
It was, you know, obviously
haven't talked to her

2260
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:27,868
for a long time, so it
was good to catch up.

2261
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:28,769
Great.

2262
01:28:29,936 --> 01:28:30,971
It's not happening.

2263
01:28:33,106 --> 01:28:35,909
I put it all out there, man,
but it's, it's too late.

2264
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:38,613
I missed my shot.

2265
01:28:40,012 --> 01:28:43,050
You know, Annie and I are
doing a little low key thing

2266
01:28:43,082 --> 01:28:45,552
for new year's, you
should come over for it.

2267
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:49,657
Nah, I got, I got some
friends invited me to a party.

2268
01:28:50,757 --> 01:28:53,094
I think they're
trying to set me up.

2269
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:57,131
Ah-ha, okay, that's great.

2270
01:28:57,163 --> 01:28:58,099
Be open to that.

2271
01:28:58,131 --> 01:28:59,366
You never know.

2272
01:29:00,434 --> 01:29:02,003
Yeah, totally.

2273
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:10,678
[festive music]

2274
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:16,617
Destroy that one please.

2275
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:18,985
[Annie] It's the best one.

2276
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:22,990
I'm really glad it worked out.

2277
01:29:23,023 --> 01:29:23,958
Yah, me too.

2278
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:25,693
It's a great turnout this year.

2279
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:28,029
I mean, us.

2280
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:31,731
You're being weird.

2281
01:29:31,765 --> 01:29:35,136
No, you know what
I mean, I just.

2282
01:29:35,168 --> 01:29:36,069
We were lucky.

2283
01:29:38,037 --> 01:29:39,639
Like it's not always that easy.

2284
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:44,412
[baby crying]

2285
01:29:44,444 --> 01:29:46,413
It is not always that easy.

2286
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,114
No.

2287
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:49,483
I think it's your turn.

2288
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:50,683
Mm-hm.

2289
01:29:50,716 --> 01:29:51,551
I think it is.

2290
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:52,552
Mm-hm.

2291
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:55,623
Yeah, I'm not keeping
count, though, I'm not.

2292
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:58,926
[Tom] Eloise, sh,
sh, sh, you're okay.

2293
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:10,771
[phone buzzing]

2294
01:30:38,832 --> 01:30:41,569
[door knocking]

2295
01:30:47,207 --> 01:30:48,042
Hey!

2296
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:54,014
Oh, wow.

2297
01:30:54,046 --> 01:30:54,881
You're going out.

2298
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:57,518
Yeah.

2299
01:30:57,551 --> 01:30:59,187
Oh, yeah, of course.

2300
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,121
How did you get my address?

2301
01:31:02,154 --> 01:31:03,190
Tom gave it to me.

2302
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:06,961
You're perpetually late, so
maybe a few minutes later

2303
01:31:06,993 --> 01:31:07,994
won't be a big deal.

2304
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,164
Huh, your place is really clean.

2305
01:31:12,198 --> 01:31:13,733
Are we really doing this?

2306
01:31:13,766 --> 01:31:15,101
So I thought about what
I was gonna say to you

2307
01:31:15,135 --> 01:31:16,570
and how I was gonna deliver it.

2308
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:18,105
And well, I brought some props.

2309
01:31:18,137 --> 01:31:19,273
So can you please just sit down,

2310
01:31:19,305 --> 01:31:20,707
be quiet and be a good listener?

2311
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:21,609
Okay?

2312
01:31:27,613 --> 01:31:28,482
Thank you.

2313
01:31:33,153 --> 01:31:35,256
So I was at home, gearing
up for the ball drop

2314
01:31:35,288 --> 01:31:36,890
and I had this
great night planned.

2315
01:31:36,923 --> 01:31:38,658
I was gonna stay home
and had the nice,

2316
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:41,595
relaxed new year's
that I always wanted.

2317
01:31:41,627 --> 01:31:42,729
And you know what?

2318
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:43,930
It was nice.

2319
01:31:43,963 --> 01:31:48,601
I ordered delivery and, [gasps]
oh shit, I ordered delivery.

2320
01:31:48,635 --> 01:31:52,139
Anyway, I was sitting
there and I realize

2321
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:56,743
that it's not exactly
as I always wanted,

2322
01:31:56,777 --> 01:32:00,314
because really what I
wanted was to be with you.

2323
01:32:00,346 --> 01:32:02,315
And I know it's cheesy and dumb,

2324
01:32:02,349 --> 01:32:06,686
but I thought I might
still have a chance.

2325
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:11,726
So I don't know how to play
Gin Rummy, but I Googled it,

2326
01:32:12,893 --> 01:32:14,161
and I saw that you just
needed a deck of cards.

2327
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,298
And I wasn't sure what
brand your Nana liked,

2328
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:20,634
but this was on sale.

2329
01:32:20,667 --> 01:32:22,169
On sale was her brand.

2330
01:32:22,202 --> 01:32:23,771
Okay, shh.

2331
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:25,172
I know you don't care about
watching the ball drop,

2332
01:32:25,204 --> 01:32:26,273
but I do.

2333
01:32:26,305 --> 01:32:28,675
So I thought we could
compromise with this doohickey.

2334
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:32,079
Three, two, one, ah!

2335
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,914
Happy New Year!

2336
01:32:34,948 --> 01:32:36,717
Whatever you want to
do when the ball drops.

2337
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:37,585
Can I talk now?

2338
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:38,586
Not yet.

2339
01:32:39,953 --> 01:32:42,656
Look, I thought about what
you said the other night

2340
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:46,761
and you did make some
mistakes, and I did too.

2341
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:49,230
And that's okay.

2342
01:32:50,363 --> 01:32:52,899
And look, I still
think I was right,

2343
01:32:52,932 --> 01:32:57,671
that we gave it a chance,
but I want to be wrong.

2344
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:01,208
And who knows if
we're meant to be,

2345
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,243
but I want to be.

2346
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:08,983
It sounded so much
better on drive over.

2347
01:33:13,987 --> 01:33:15,989
Okay, you may speak now.

2348
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:22,896
Since when do you
believe in meant to be?

2349
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:24,599
I'm reconsidering my position.

2350
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:31,872
You know, I'm supposed
to this warehouse party.

2351
01:33:31,904 --> 01:33:32,840
I see what you're doing,

2352
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:33,673
you're trying to make me squirm.

2353
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:34,742
I think it's working.

2354
01:33:34,774 --> 01:33:36,210
