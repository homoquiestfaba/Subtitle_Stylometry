1
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,100
Right... I have a secret
to tell you.

2
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,460
You're in the middle
the road...

3
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
I know... Want to hear it?

4
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,650
Want to move the car first?
- Actually, no.

5
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,220
Just want to tell you more
something.

6
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
What?

7
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
This will not succeed...

8
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Okay, tell me.

9
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I'm in love with you...

10
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,335
Let the children
walk with nature...

11
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
They see the beautiful
ties and communions...

12
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,180
...between life and death...

13
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
The joyous inseparable unity...

14
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,040
And learn that death is
indeed, required...

15
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,140
And as beautiful as life.

16
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,535
That's my hope for Bennett.

17
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,080
This young amazing...

18
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,240
...we were caught
so suddenly...

19
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
...that was so beloved,
surrounded by all that beautiful thought.

20
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,940
It is with this state of mind
we returned Bennett...

21
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,040
...to that kingdom where God
miraculously created life.

22
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,805
Open the door, Ryan.
- One moment.

23
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,120
Me... Me...

24
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on, let me enter.

25
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,160
Creed, Ryan.
Open those windows.

26
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,020
I do not care what you say,
next time, let Gloria help you.

27
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,980
It looks like something died
and went to heaven.

28
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,980
I did not know she was here.
- It is not.

29
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,960
But she will return
very soon.

30
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,080
Where were you?
- I was here.

31
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
What? At home?
- Yes..

32
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,050
Give the guys once in a while, yeah?
His mother is worried.

33
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,060
What I want to know,
I need to know... is...

34
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,680
How were the 17 minutes of life
for my child?

35
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,900
I do not know what to say,
Mrs. Brewer, I was not there...

36
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,540
She talked to every doctor,

37
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,940
each nurse, each paramedic
each firefighter...

38
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,460
...who worked on that night.

39
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,820
I do not know what information
I can give you further.

40
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,300
Jordan and Walker?
- It's still in a coma.

41
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,420
I know, but I have a video
a surveillance camera...

42
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,860
...and in this video looks like
they talked...

43
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,260
...might have talked.

44
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,020
He would have been able to
talk to my son?

45
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,140
This depends on the slow
bleeding in his brain.

46
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,000
It is possible that he
become conscious...

47
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,980
...enough
hold a conversation.

48
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,940
Then he would have been the last person
talking to my son before he dies?

49
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Yes.

50
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,060
Sorry, I have an appointment.

51
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,620
When he thinks
will wake up?

52
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,100
As I said before, Ms. Brewer,
already gave you all the answers I knew.

53
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,980
But he could wake up and say,
what are the signs?

54
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Sorry.

55
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Allen?

56
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Allen?

57
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,960
Hi. Hi, how are you?
Sorry.

58
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm a little tired...

59
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,160
You're sweating.

60
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Yes.. Yes.. Thank you.
You're right.

61
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,140
These figures are correct? For there
I have nothing here for the summer.

62
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Allen?
- Okay.

63
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,120
It seems you
forgot to sleep.

64
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,380
I'm fine.
Okay.

65
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,420
Thanks for the flowers,
not needed...

66
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,140
So many times I wanted to call you,
did not know what to do in this situation.

67
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,620
Just want to be strong for Grace
is everything. That's what I'm doing.

68
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
Sure...

69
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,000
So... We...
We have 30 students here.

70
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,960
Ready and praying
to form.

71
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,465
Well, I'll see what I can do.

72
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,020
If you want something,
anything, just tell me.

73
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,920
I know.

74
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,755
Today I had an idea
interesting.

75
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I even made a purchase.

76
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,600
There seems to be much research on
to mourn the death of someone.

77
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,120
I found some
interesting suggestions.

78
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,160
No, Allen, no...

79
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Suggest that we use
a bell.

80
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,960
We can play it when
Bennett to miss...

81
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Or... when we think of it.

82
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,140
You can put it
anywhere in the house.

83
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Let me see it.

84
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,160
Hello
- Oi...

85
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,365
Is the Rose, right?
- Yes.

86
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Come in.

87
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Here...

88
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,060
Want a tea, a soda?

89
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,180
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Sorry that I spend here.

90
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,640
No way.
I'm glad you came.

91
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,860
I've been wanting to talk to you
since the funeral.

92
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,620
Yes, I know. I wish I could have given
more answers to his wife.

93
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,060
I know how much she wanted them.

94
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,300
She certainly wants answers.
You are very focused on that subject.

95
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,735
But it's just a matter of time.
How are you feeling?

96
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,140
Water... Can you give me
some water?

97
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,140
Yes, of course. Sit there
and feel free.

98
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,980
I've been trying to imagine
how you met Bennett.

99
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,980
You are part of the government
Huston?

100
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
No...

101
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Then you must be a trainee
in the newspaper?

102
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
No...

103
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,060
Community service?
Tell me if I'm hot or cold.

104
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Cold.

105
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,540
Did not think Bennett kept
connect with friends from primary school.

106
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,240
No. I'm the one
he impregnated.

107
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,200
Pardon?
- I'm pregnant.

108
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,160
Sorry... But...
Do not understand.

109
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,455
I am three months pregnant.

110
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
It's Bennett?

111
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Yes.

112
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Are you sure?

113
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Yes.

114
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
You will have it?

115
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,300
He told me just now
a night together.

116
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,820
I do not believe
she has no where to go.

117
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,540
It should have a place to stay
until the paternity test.

118
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,860
Paternity test?

119
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,740
Not undergo
to this poor girl.

120
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,060
You are defending it?
- Do not'm defending.

121
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,300
Just do not see why
she would invent it.

122
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,620
Why has 18 years
and has no money.

123
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,060
I can not handle it.
I just can not.

124
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,140
Grace, Grace, Grace...
Come here... Come here...

125
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,240
Not even know
this girl.

126
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,940
She seems to be a
good girl.

127
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,900
If it is, after all,
I will not be happy with it.

128
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,460
I do not want everyone to think
we have been blessed.

129
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,060
You think we're blessed?
- No, I think.

130
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,700
Probably it was
who painted his hair.

131
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,180
He would never do that.

132
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,980
Continue making the bed.
I'm going down to get it.

133
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Why she had to come
to our house?

134
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,220
We are in mourning,
This does not bode well for baby.

135
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,040
She should have no other choice.

136
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Are you really pregnant?
- Yes.

137
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,180
This is easy to imagine...

138
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,140
The only thing wrong that
my brother does,

139
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,065
and is not even here to
face the consequences.

140
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,020
I am the Rose.
- I know, I know who you are.

141
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,180
My brother had his picture
on the bedside table.

142
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,540
Is it?
- Yes.

143
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,140
Not touched because it certainly
masturbated with her every night.

144
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,640
You are the younger brother?
- Yes, high.

145
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,380
He did not tell you
I'm a freak?

146
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,280
No, never told
you were high.

147
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
It was only polite.

148
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,220
Are you okay?

149
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,020
Yes, I'm alright
not seem to be good?

150
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,060
Well, it looks kind of rough.

151
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,040
I am a little uneasy, yes...

152
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,380
You have a fever.

153
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,340
I do not know why,
I'm feeling good.

154
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Ryan...
- Yes?

155
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,220
My mother has just
hospitalized for rehabilitation.

156
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Take a gatorade, it helps.

157
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,715
What I would say if asked
about tonight?

158
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,900
How about a compliment
so I gave you earlier?

159
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,380
Because you gave me nothing.

160
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I gave you everything.
- Okay, but I want more.

161
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,230
Want to know what
're thinking.

162
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Please.

163
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,040
I'd say...

164
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I'd say...

165
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,120
The biggest?

166
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
I like that...

167
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I like these words.

168
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,060
Somebody help me
find my baby. </ i>

169
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,140
Somebody help me
find my baby.

170
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,000
I do not know where he went.

171
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,860
Have you seen my baby?
You can find it?

172
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Can not find it...
He's so small.

173
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,380
I can not...
Can not find it.

174
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,020
My mother will walk
every night at 6.

175
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,100
I followed her for two nights.
She goes around the block,

176
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,260
repeatedly
looking for James.

177
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,660
Wait a moment.

178
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Hi. You must be Ryan.

179
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,960
Come in, please.
Sit.

180
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,100
We just finished
with Leighton...

181
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,140
Feel free to listen
or to participate at any time.

182
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,400
Okay.
- Sorry, Leighton.

183
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,140
When I asked my father
where she was,

184
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,140
said he was
looking for James.

185
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,580
Sometimes she runs
his room and opens the door...

186
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,940
...like to see it
the computer or something.

187
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,620
Often, parents who do not
saw the body, like her mother,

188
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,140
still searching for their children
in crowds.

189
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,940
Sometimes even think
they see them.

190
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,620
It's normal, Leighton.

191
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,700
The best you can
do for your mother...

192
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,420
...is to talk about it with her.

193
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I think I can help.

194
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,080
And then Ryan. Hi.
- Oi...

195
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,200
What brings you here?
- Nothing.

196
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,140
Just thought I'd
the normal thing to do.

197
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,220
You are experiencing some
symptom of loss?

198
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
No.

199
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,725
Who came to see the lady?
- Jordan Walker.

200
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Do not know why they do
not understand this.

201
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,060
He prefers the curtains
open during the day.

202
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,340
Really?

203
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,980
He told you that
after ordering the aquarium there?

204
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,310
He just wanted a little life
this room.

205
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,580
Decaf Coffee, macchiato flavor
caramel and extra foam.

206
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,020
Here's to me.

207
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,500
If you're trying to bribe me...

208
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,980
...to feed the fish
on weekends, give up.

209
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,960
Okay. I'll be here
over the weekend.

210
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Thanks.
- Sure.

211
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,420
And Tony could ask Dr. Jacobs
to move here when you arrive?

212
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,260
I have some questions for him.
- Instantly...

213
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Thank you.

214
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,700
Not have to talk, if you want.

215
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,660
You can just listen.

216
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,620
I strongly recommend
I do not share.

217
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,035
These people are
like vultures of grief.

218
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,340
So why do you
here?

219
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,820
I've got nowhere to go.

220
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,660
And my sister Amy burst
brains at the church.

221
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,960
Sorry.
- What about you?

222
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,120
My brother... died
in a car accident.

223
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,660
There are lots of car accidents here.

224
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,180
Leighton's brother was in a car,
that of the Sarah and Jason...

225
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,620
The sister of Hilary
had an overdose, e...

226
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,380
Jeremy's brother died
even before he was born.

227
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,060
He is the most dramatic here.
Looks as if he remembers him.

228
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,175
So is the one with suicide?
- How to know it was not murder?

229
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,545
Because you just said
she blew his brains out.

230
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,060
It's just suicide...
Nothing special.

231
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,020
You know... It is not easy, or...
more interesting.

232
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,115
All the different layers
the problems of fucked.

233
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,040
I'm fine.
I'm doing fine, really.

234
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,180
Well, if not, the group is
great to talk about it.

235
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,780
Your friends will avoid you
like the plague.

236
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,420
Not talk about it with them.

237
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,560
So I'm glad
you are here.

238
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
Did you ever notice me,

239
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,040
in times when we crossed?

240
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,580
At least recognize me,
at some point?

241
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,140
Keep your eyes closed.
I'm almost done.

242
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
The two are closed.

243
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,440
Are closed.
- Great.

244
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,040
So, you were elected
'Most Popular'

245
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,860
or 'the best of all,'

246
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,120
or 'the best guy to know,'
right?

247
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,140
Right... Yes, I was elected
the best of all.

248
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
So you're a
nice guy?

249
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
I think so.

250
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
That's why we're here?

251
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,250
Why is cool with everyone?

252
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
No...

253
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,090
You do not seem more
the king of the dance.

254
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
What the fuck.

255
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,900
My mother will kill me.

256
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,380
I thought it went down well.

257
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,140
Really?
- Yes.

258
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes?
- Yes.

259
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,960
You're so beautiful, Rose.

260
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,140
Tell us if there is something
who can not eat.

261
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,940
I wonder how your stomach
should be sensitive now.

262
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,660
I desire to eat
Taco Bell burritos.

263
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,700
Peanut butter and bananas
was that of Grace, right?

264
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,220
Right.

265
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,660
When Grace had Ryan,

266
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,140
thought I would give
birth to a Banana Split.

267
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,365
Actually, it was Bennett.

268
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,100
Bryan is enjoying the summer?

269
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Summer is over.

270
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Right.

271
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,515
Tell me why.
I can not remember.

272
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,000
Okay. Here's another.
How's school?

273
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,140
Goes well. I have every
classes they wanted...

274
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,900
After school, I
and the guys went swimming...

275
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,580
...and perhaps later
we go to the movies.

276
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,080
Excellent.
- Why is it great?

277
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,020
Seems like a good way
to spend the day.

278
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,925
All that's missing
a bean burrito.

279
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,900
Got something to Rose.
- Great. Let's see what it is.

280
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,900
Has a website
where do i put a picture of two people...

281
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,100
...and sees himself as
would their children.

282
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,980
I put your picture and that of Bennett,

283
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,020
and according to them,
the son of you...

284
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,220
...goes to school
the weirdos on the bus.

285
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,660
Ryan, this is not appropriate.

286
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Let me see.

287
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,140
Look. Look.

288
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,060
At least, establishing the
his standards very well, right?

289
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,460
Enough is enough, Ryan.
Thank you.

290
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Still I love him.

291
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,940
Does anyone know if the time
will improve over the weekend?

292
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,900
Why do it? Why does it always changes
the subject when it comes to Bennett.

293
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,020
I do not do that.
- Yes, you do.

294
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Grace...
- You do. What?

295
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,460
You painted the hair
Our son of blue?

296
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,700
Rose did not want to talk
about it at dinner.

297
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,500
Why not? I just want to know.
- Grace, come on.

298
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,860
Why fuss now?

299
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,500
I'm just asking a question.

300
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,830
You painted blue or not
our son's hair?

301
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Finished.

302
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
Yes.

303
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,060
You know, when I went to the morgue,
I thought it was him...

304
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,100
I thought it was another, because our
son never painted his hair blue.

305
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,235
And I thought maybe there was a
mistake, and then... I saw his face e...

306
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,000
...he was, was our son.

307
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,200
And he was dead... again.

308
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,120
It was as if he had died
twice.

309
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Sorry.

310
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,015
I did not want to create case
just wanted to ask a question.

311
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Can I come in time
attendance, if it is easier.

312
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,260
No, no, do not do this, Dante.
Iets start from the beginning.

313
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,440
I will return tomorrow.
I'll make an appointment.

314
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,040
I'm fine...
I'm fine.

315
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,700
Maybe you should think about
take more time to leave.

316
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,220
Can I get a replacement.

317
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,900
No, do not. I'm fine.

318
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,570
It's just that I have not yet
my breakfast.

319
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,020
Have dinner with me tonight?
Without conditions...

320
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,350
We used to be good friends...
Remember?

321
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,960
I... just need
a night of sleep...

322
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,060
That's my problem,
need a night's sleep.

323
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
And the beach house?

324
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,100
It's certainly a wonderful place...

325
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,160
...to forget the world
awhile.

326
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,000
Grace loves the beach house.

327
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:51,160
Right. Well.. When the mother of
Rick died,

328
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,855
I took the whole family to Florida
a few weeks, made a difference...

329
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,855
I can no longer
talk to you.

330
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,540
You know that.

331
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,740
I just want to make sure that
you're taking care of yourself.

332
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,960
It was not always Grace.

333
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,500
Ryan, go to the beach house.
- When?

334
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,900
I do not want to hear anything, the decision
was taken, the whole family goes.

335
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Only when asked.

336
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,900
Now, today.

337
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,460
Can I bring someone?
- Yes, of course. Who?

338
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,900
Ashley.
- Okay.

339
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,600
No drugs.
- Please, Daddy, why not?

340
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,460
I'm serious, Ryan. Go help
his mother to pack.

341
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,875
Think you'll want a sample
before we go?

342
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,020
Please, Grace, disconnect it.

343
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,220
I do not understand how the car
shatters so.

344
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,900
Maybe we should show
Bill again, because...

345
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,580
Maybe there was something
wrong with the structure of the car.

346
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
There was.

347
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,860
He exits the truck,
goes to Bennett and then...

348
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,500
It seems that talks to him...

349
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,500
Grace. Ryan has a sample
would love to test.

350
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
talks to him and
gives his coat to him...

351
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,500
Will test the sample or not?

352
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,800
He stayed alive for 17 minutes.
It has no curiosity...

353
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,460
...about what happened
in those 17 minutes?

354
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,100
Perhaps this is a good time to
to stop the tests, you know?

355
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,500
Ryan looks good...
We're not going to push.

356
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
What do you think?

357
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,220
I think it's important
be consistent.

358
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
That's right.

359
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,340
I was just thinking
this is too much.

360
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,330
It's okay, I'm alright
I can do it.

361
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,205
You did not lead
the beach house, it took?

362
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Of course not.

363
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,000
This music is wonderful.

364
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,080
Has anyone ever made love
the sound of this song?

365
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,090
Mom already did...
She is laughing.

366
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,000
I'm sitting on his bed?
- Yes.

367
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,120
It's creepy.

368
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
You two get along?

369
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,220
We fought a little
when we were little,

370
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,500
Mom says I always followed him.

371
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,340
He was so cute.

372
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,820
My mom thinks it was the thing
Incredible as ever lived, but...

373
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,510
In fact, he knew to be
a child's mother when he wanted.

374
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,560
He won a lot of gadgets.

375
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
It... He won.

376
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,060
You would probably want
courting him.

377
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,620
No.
- Yes, you would want. Believe me.

378
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,380
He had that effect on people.

379
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,305
I know my mother wanted
courting him at times.

380
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,080
What about you?
- As for me, what?

381
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Who would you date?

382
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,920
I do not know...
You, perhaps?

383
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Maybe...

384
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,680
I will win. Arrive first
down there. Here we go.

385
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Hi, Grace.

386
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Got a minute?
- Sure.

387
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
I bought a book.

388
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,860
A book about babies.

389
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,805
And there are so many questions
I do not know the answers.

390
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:04,900
And then I expect you
help me complete it.

391
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,485
Not a good time?
- Okay. What do you need?

392
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,960
His name... As you
Bennett chose the name?

393
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,725
Because of Tony Bennett.
- Singer?

394
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,530
It is not easy to choose the name
our baby.

395
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,900
Allen and I did not agree
as the name for a girl.

396
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,100
Ruby and I wanted it
something more traditional.

397
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,920
Ruby... It's beautiful.

398
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,060
So... I hope this
helps you.

399
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,420
Want to feel?

400
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,380
Why do not you swim
like the others?

401
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,060
He always kicks me out,
when listening to your voice... Feel.

402
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm fine, thanks.
- Please...

403
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
It's strong.

404
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Again.

405
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,100
I never imagined that
would become pregnant.

406
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,420
Neither thought it was possible
the first time.

407
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,730
Who has that kind of luck?

408
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,940
Do you think that was the first time
Bennett?

409
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,120
Yes, I think so.

410
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,640
Funny, is not, you are
the one to talk to me about it?

411
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,145
I love to talk, most of all,
I have so many questions.

412
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,470
I think you should
go swimming.

413
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,160
I 'Bennett.
- Nice to meet you, Bennett.

414
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Nice to meet you too.

415
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,340
Right...
- Wait.

416
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,900
What college are you going?
- The Barnard. And you?

417
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,500
I thought it was New York.

418
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,820
No, I go to Barnard,
gave me scholarship.

419
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,045
Beauty. I go to Berkeley.

420
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Without scholarship.

421
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,920
Gotta go to work.
I'm always late.

422
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,120
You are right...
Please do not go.

423
00:38:22,494 --> 00:38:24,420
It took me a year to take courage
to speak with you.

424
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Do not go, please.

425
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,940
You waited until 3:15
the last day of school.

426
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,265
Right... I never said I was good
to choose the moment.

427
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Gotta go to work.

428
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,000
Do I... I go with you?
- Yes.

429
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,900
Sorry...
- Yes..

430
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes? Are you sure?

431
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,680
Ryan. Ryan.

432
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,100
Ryan.

433
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,480
Ryan. Here comes a storm.
Exit the water.

434
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,600
What?
- Do not question me.

435
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Just get out of the water.
Now.

436
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,060
I can swim.

437
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,080
Damn. Get out now. Right now.
And I'm serious.

438
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,000
You understand me?
Please come.

439
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,080
Damn. Get out now.

440
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,980
What are you doing?
- Do not want to hear from you.

441
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Listen to me.

442
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,060
Did you swim?

443
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,560
Yes, yes...
Yes, I swam.

444
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,860
It was... well, it was good. Was
a little cold, but it was good.

445
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Are you okay?

446
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,200
Ah, yes, I'm cool. I'm fine.
Just fine.

447
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,020
There's nothing like a breeze
the ocean, you know?

448
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,020
I know... I always wanted
live near the ocean.

449
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,980
My mother thought I
was almost a freak.

450
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,540
But that thing.
- It makes no sense.

451
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,940
No, not really.

452
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,020
His mother is more than welcome to
be with us if she wants.

453
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,060
Would not work. My mother
it is not very healthy...

454
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,300
I do not think it would scare
someone in our house.

455
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,040
The truth is not told her
I'm pregnant.

456
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Why not?

457
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,900
Because she chose to tell me that
the wrong way.

458
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,125
Do not want to hear it...

459
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,340
I do not think you have chosen
the wrong way.

460
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,980
I'm not sure why the chose,
but do not regret what he did.

461
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,940
I know there's other options.
- We would support either.

462
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,700
I am not against any of them.
- Of course not.

463
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,820
I just... I do not know.
- Do not you know?

464
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,920
No, I really know...
- You do not know.

465
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,315
You do not know. It's okay.
We can talk about that another time.

466
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
We go to the cinema?

467
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,640
Ryan.
Allen?

468
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,020
Want to see my trick
I do at parties?

469
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,280
Sure.
- Okay. Hold it.

470
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
Look at that.

471
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,180
Good.

472
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,020
Actually I never did it at a party.
I do not know how I walked away with it.

473
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,095
Is there any trick
to do at parties?

474
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,730
Do not know if this counts, but never
forget the numbers of people.

475
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,260
I tend
to memorize numbers.

476
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
What are my numbers?

477
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,000
You have 18 years,
216 months...

478
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,120
...164 weeks, 25,920 days...

479
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,040
...311,040 hours.

480
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,960
You have arrived at our door...

481
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,000
...in... August 14, 2008,
at 2:30 pm,

482
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,080
his delivery is planned
for February 12, 2009.

483
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,040
Still remaining
over 119 days...

484
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,160
...2136 hours...

485
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,160
...128,160 minutes.

486
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,880
And you have two
heartbeats.

487
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,350
As far as I know is
you, tell you more.

488
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,735
This trick for your party
is so much better.

489
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,420
What happened? Where is Grace?
- She's fine.

490
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,100
There in the back.
- And my son?

491
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,100
Upstairs.
- What happened?

492
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,420
His wife fell ill in
supermarket and needed assistance.

493
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,020
She's out there?
- Yes.

494
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,840
Thank you, officer.
This is Rose.

495
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,060
Are you okay?

496
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,220
I called a cab.
- Why do not you call me?

497
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,530
Because your phone
was off.

498
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Sorry...
I was at the movies.

499
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,785
Have you been to the movies?
- Yes, with Rose.

500
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,945
It was nice to get out a bit.

501
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,920
Why did you shut down
your phone?

502
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,120
Were only two hours.

503
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,000
Anything can happen
in two hours.

504
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,160
What happened
at the supermarket?

505
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,175
It was a funny movie?
Did you laugh?

506
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,960
That was sad, you cry?

507
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,040
I can not stand it.

508
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,920
I warn you...
You do not...

509
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,020
I just want to know
what happened. That's it.

510
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,960
I had an idea... If you want,
go to Paris with Rose,

511
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,290
or Rome, or somewhere very romantic,
take a holiday from all this... death.

512
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,020
That's not fair.

513
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Know what is fair?

514
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,980
It's not fair that you can go
to the movies with her,

515
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,060
and I can not pass through the grain
Bennett's favorite...

516
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,160
Please... Do not do it...
Do not do it...

517
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,760
Sorry. God. God.
God. God.

518
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,255
Where are you going?
No. No.

519
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,960
Sorry. Sorry.
Come here...

520
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,080
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

521
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm so sorry...

522
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Sorry. Sorry.
So sorry.

523
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,960
So sorry.
I really am sorry.

524
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,960
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

525
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,420
Grace, love only you,
and no one else understands me?

526
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,940
Sorry. I am very sorry
to be gone for so long.

527
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,525
But now I'm back.
But how wonderful. Look.

528
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,620
Can not even follow
the simple instructions.

529
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,800
How many times have you told them
you need light?

530
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,420
Okay, enough already.
Let's read.

531
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,920
Not even remember
where we left off.

532
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,145
It was in the 7th or the 8th Chapter.

533
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,120
Let's see...
Eighth chapter.

534
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:28,980
Let's finish the whole list of readings
for the summer, as this is the first.

535
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,060
And tell her that the college
is more boring than the college.

536
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,965
Right. Where were we?
Let's see...

537
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,820
He began to move
a dream...

538
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,500
Shivering as the needle gauge
when pointed toward the stairs,

539
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,620
His squeaky voice, stare...
Something seemed to have gone wrong.

540
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,120
My... reflections...
You know something?

541
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,380
Allen... was not always so.
I do not want the judge,

542
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,900
it is actually a man
very nice.

543
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,805
And you would see this
if he knew.

544
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,000
He never loved anyone
less than it should, never.

545
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,120
I want you to know that.

546
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,460
It's just a phase... A phase
we are going through, that's all.

547
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Exactly
like any other.

548
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,865
'What is it?'
I stammered softly, e...

549
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,340
He is all of you.
- What is happening?

550
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,940
Wait. What...?
- He will be transferred.

551
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,340
Where?
Why?

552
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,220
There is an arrest warrant.

553
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,300
Go to the municipal hospital,
where there is 24 hour security.

554
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,740
There must be a mistake...
- There is some mistake.

555
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,180
What about his stuff?

556
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,340
You will not need them
where it is going.

557
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,660
You'll be scared if their
things have gone.

558
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,820
What do you think that a man
these will bring to your life?

559
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,180
Once you agree, if you wake up...
goes straight to Rikers Prison.

560
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,280
Go visit him there too?

561
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,660
I think Grace is perhaps the
having an affair.

562
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,060
No.

563
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,040
If not the blame.

564
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,205
I do not think she would.

565
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,000
I did...
I had a case.

566
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,585
I needed to know
she loved me.

567
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,160
I am tired. All my life I
I felt like it was our 1st meeting.

568
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,920
I never deserved.

569
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,630
Want to go to a party with me?

570
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
'll be fun. </ b>

571
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,900
I'm not dressed
for this.

572
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,485
Do not worry.
They are not judging people.

573
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,880
My God.
You're great.

574
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,900
Never thought I could
stretch so </ b>

575
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,860
Shea, this is Allen.
Allen, this is Shea.

576
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,460
Hi, how are you?
- Hi Nice to meet you.

577
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,580
Wait. Realized that this is the visual...

578
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,700
...with which they would never want
be seen at a party, right?

579
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,460
No, but I'm wearing clothes
pregnant with Grace, then no way.

580
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
And you?
- Yeah.

581
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,400
You really are perfect.

582
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,600
Let's go.

583
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,230
Nor would I want to dead
be seen naked.

584
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,920
You're pregnant
or something?

585
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Yes, I am.

586
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,100
You live under the viaduct
and will have a baby homeless...

587
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,700
...and will use it to get
more money?

588
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,900
No, I'm just
a normal pregnancy.

589
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,260
Bring it on.

590
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,000
Neither would get me killed
having a baby.

591
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,960
It's okay if I bring
more?

592
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,165
If you're good for you
I have to tell you a thing.

593
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,960
Listen... I'm addicted.

594
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,980
I'm traveling and everything else...

595
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,460
It's something Britney Spears would say:
'I'm traveling,' take out?

596
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,980
We can go somewhere else.

597
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,248
No, wait. Wait. Say...

598
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:30,900
...something familiar,
please. Something familiar.

599
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,920
I am simply seeing
too many ghosts.

600
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Potato chips.

601
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,360
SpongeBob.

602
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,120
Monkeys?

603
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,900
The ones that you pull out the balls, drop
your birthday cake, or legal?

604
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The law.

605
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,040
Go, baby, go.

606
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,460
What did you do?
- They autographed my belly.

607
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,060
It seemed cute at the time...

608
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,880
'Have a great summer
with the new kid.'

609
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
Never short annuals.

610
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,160
Want to autograph?
- Okay.

611
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,835
Perhaps it was easier
if you talked with Grace about it.

612
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Floodgates...

613
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,890
Do not know what to do
if they were opened.

614
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,775
I'll talk about someone.
But evil is upon him. </ B>

615
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,820
Why would you do that?

616
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,575
Because there are things
I need to tell you.

617
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Okay.

618
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,480
I met this guy...

619
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,425
He was really
wonderful to me.

620
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,420
Is everything okay?

621
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
Yes.

622
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,990
The first time I saw him,
was in English class.

623
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,980
He wore a baseball cap
on the first day of class.

624
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,880
The teacher made him take it off
and his hair was all shook up,

625
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,860
and he smiled at me
while trying to straighten it.

626
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,595
We looked each other
thereafter.

627
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,885
And I began to feel
as if he knew.

628
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,617
He looked so much your
picture in the yearbook

629
00:56:10,717 --> 00:56:12,020
I knew your face color.

630
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,960
Last year, I had piano lessons.
And he, football.

631
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,655
Then we were crossing each day after
classes exactly the same place.

632
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,080
And it became something
I waited anxiously.

633
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,640
So eagerly I can say
every day he missed,

634
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,060
because they were the days
I was disappointed.

635
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,600
And sometimes he looked at me...
other times, turning her face...

636
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,820
...And sometimes was so intense...

637
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,105
...we started to look at
from the very beginning of the steps.

638
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,080
And then the last day,
He spoke to me.

639
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:00,260
And everything he told me
was exactly as I imagined it would.

640
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,060
And he felt like he felt
in my dreams,

641
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,939
and thought that everything
happened exactly...

642
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:10,419
...the way it should happen.

643
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,360
And I was happy as ever
was.

644
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,120
Happy and fearful
the same time.

645
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,075
And if he saw my belly,
would have written something comforting.

646
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,880
This was one of the hardest things
already decided.

647
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,675
It took me three years
to do so.

648
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,250
And I was in love
for it...

649
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,020
That's why we'll stay
with the baby.

650
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,265
I was in love with him
for four years.

651
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,960
I hardly knew him... But everything was
exactly as pictured...

652
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,445
Everything was... exactly
as I visualized.

653
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,420
I had to stay
with this baby.

654
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,990
I think it was love
of my life.

655
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
I am very tired...

656
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,040
I can not keep fighting.

657
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,880
So tired...

658
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,960
It was a good story.
- Thanks.

659
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,900
I did not mean in that sense,
I say, it was good to hear.

660
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,315
Not for you,
but for me it was, I think.

661
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,980
So how was the funeral
your brother?

662
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,920
I do not remember.
- Faulty memory?

663
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,780
No, not really remember,
I was very high.

664
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,900
Did not know you are drugged...

665
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,080
I do not crank. My mom tests me
every two weeks.

666
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,030
That's what they do to prove
my life is normal.

667
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,270
Need company?
- Yes, of course.

668
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,990
The baby is upside down,
which means it is almost time.

669
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,365
How are you feeling, Mr. Brewer?
Looks like you need rest.

670
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,920
I'm fine, thanks.
How's the baby?

671
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,680
Just as I want
she is now.

672
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,820
It's a girl?
- Sorry, I thought you knew.

673
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,960
It's a girl?
- Congratulations.

674
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,780
She is healthy?

675
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,500
It is stronger than the
Her heartbeat.

676
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,880
Took good care of her.

677
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,960
This is wonderful.

678
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,120
This is wonderful.

679
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,120
Excuse me.

680
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,880
It's wonderful.
Okay, be right back.

681
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,880
Well done.

682
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,220
What is your problem?
- Only need 1 minute.

683
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,720
So... Take a minute.
I'll go back inside.

684
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,900
I do not want this baby, Allen, and not
care if it sounds horrible.

685
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,420
That sounds horrible.

686
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,860
If he were alive,
she would not be with the baby.

687
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,220
I can be her friend.
- There needs to be.

688
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,580
Do not be.
- No, no, do nothing.

689
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,880
I do not care anymore.

690
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,345
Can not tell
how am I feeling?

691
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,500
Not when everything you say
sounds so terrible.

692
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,660
You're right.
Losing a child is terrible.

693
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,220
You are not
the owner of suffering.

694
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,260
It is not the only one who knows suffering.
Other people suffer.

695
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,700
You do not. Not shed
a tear, not once.

696
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,940
I'll enter.
- ... Go to sporting events

697
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,540
Someone has to remain strong,
stay long. If I collapse,

698
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,940
everything goes to hell
and not allow it.

699
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,740
Sorry if I can not cope
with nothing but my pain...

700
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,780
...and not treat the family as an army.

701
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,820
Not everything is about you
or her pain, Grace.

702
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,860
There are people in our lives
that need our attention.

703
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,980
They do not give a puppy who has just
losing a dog. You do not do that.

704
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,900
So what do we do?
We returned it?

705
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,260
We give her 20 bucks
and wish him luck?

706
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,500
Treat it as a
gift given to us,

707
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,460
as if everything good that our
son died, that does not soften the blow.

708
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,560
For me, yes.

709
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,660
I'm happy for you.
I'm glad...

710
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,980
...the girl is the reason for our son
dead soften the blow for you.

711
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,080
It's not fair...

712
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,060
What was he doing in
the middle of the road?

713
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,860
If you were with friends,
if you were with us,

714
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,940
would be on the road?
Answer me.

715
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,880
You know nothing about it.
It made no effort to meet her.

716
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,460
Do not want to get to know her,
does not understand this?

717
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:13,575
Should have been her to die
that night. Should have been it.

718
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
Hello..?

719
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,920
Oi
- Can I help you?

720
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Yes Ashley made this scarf
in my car. Who are you?

721
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,280
I'm Amy. I live here.

722
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,880
Amy?
- Yes.

723
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,260
Amy, the older sister
Ashley?

724
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,980
What she told you? I had
died electrocuted?

725
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,980
I fell into the sea during a cruise?

726
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,220
What did she say this time?
- Ryan.

727
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,220
I'll tell Mom.
- I hate you.

728
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,860
Ryan. Ryan, please, I can explain.
Ryan, listen to me, please.

729
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,060
They do not mind me.
For them, I could be dead.

730
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,540
No idea what this is.
- Yes, do. Sorry. Sorry.

731
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,700
You're a liar.
Is that what you are.

732
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,140
Look...
This is not so bad.

733
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,000
You have no idea
how it is. Say.

734
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,880
Say no idea
how it is.

735
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
No idea.

736
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,020
Open the gate.
Open the fucking door.

737
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,540
Desculpe. S wanted
You like me.

738
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
Fuck you.

739
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,680
Hello.

740
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,960
Hello.

741
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,980
What did you do?
- I called Gloria.

742
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,060
You said you do not speak
about it.

743
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:46,090
We could not live with the house
that way. Come on, please.

744
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,880
Wait. Wait.
Wait. What is this?

745
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,560
You washed the shirts of him?
're Fired.

746
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
Sorry...
- Stop.

747
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,640
You deleted...

748
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,300
What did you do? Is acting
as a child. I did not do anything about this.

749
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,860
I enjoyed looking at pictures of him
and smell you.

750
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,900
And now everything is gone.
- He's here.

751
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,900
No, he's not here.
He's dead.

752
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,120
I know it, damn it.

753
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:19,305
We have nothing else to which we cling,
do not you understand?

754
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,520
What is your problem?
You can not just...

755
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,440
Sorry.

756
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,040
Oh, my God.

757
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,280
Ms. Brewer...

758
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,940
He had all the symptoms
of a heart attack:

759
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,460
difficulty breathing...
tightness in the chest...

760
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,900
...changes in heartbeat
heart... dizziness...

761
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,860
But it was not a heart attack?
- We can not say that.

762
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,700
The electrocardiogram is normal.
- What?

763
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,460
His body is under tremendous
stress, Ms. Brewer.

764
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,020
High blood pressure... sinusitis reflected
an ear infection...

765
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,300
And he suffers from a severe
lack of sleep.

766
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,020
But it was a heart attack?

767
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,260
Sometimes patients
manifest symptoms...

768
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,460
...because it is easier to feel physical pain
than emotional.

769
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,840
Ryan.
I was not waiting.

770
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,840
Can I share something?

771
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,020
My... my story, or whatever
that is what you do here.

772
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,860
Yes, of course.
- Where do I start?

773
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,580
Wherever you start?
- Start where you like.

774
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,580
I can say that my brother
was a jerk?

775
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,020
You can say anything you want.

776
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,260
My brother was a jerk, right?

777
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,940
And now that he died,
is a drug of martyr.

778
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,880
In fact, he's dead, right?

779
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,380
He had the chance to see the body?

780
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,640
No, I was too drugged.

781
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,980
My mom picked me up and could not
move, or moved her head.

782
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:40,100
Then I could not say goodbye.
I was just lying in bed...

783
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,260
...thinking about all the attention he
would have back home...

784
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,940
...and how your dumb friends
sign the plaster...

785
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,100
And as he probably still
win a shag out of pity.

786
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,080
So I did not say goodbye.

787
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,960
And now... You know?
Turns out...

788
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,880
Turns out... he...

789
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,920
He was never a jerk.

790
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,555
In fact, he was
very nice to me.

791
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,581
He could have snitched
me a thousand times...

792
01:09:25,681 --> 01:09:26,820
...and never did.

793
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,820
He and I used to do
all kinds of crap together.

794
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,020
The truth is that I want to be
exactly like him.

795
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,670
I love him more than anything.

796
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:42,000
And I was too drugged
to say goodbye.

797
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,860
And I believe that everything I gave him...

798
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,960
...was nothing.

799
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,194
You know what it is to
have only one chance...

800
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:55,294
...and throw it away?

801
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,095
Was up. I will never have
this chance again.

802
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,920
Miss him so much.

803
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Hello, Mrs. Brewer.
- You woke up.

804
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,380
Yesterday morning.

805
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,000
Do not called me. Is he okay?
- Looks good.

806
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,820
Will be transferred to prison
from Rikers in 10 minutes.

807
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,040
Can I talk to him?
- Make it quick.

808
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Hello

809
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,000
I am Grace... Brewer.

810
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,880
Bennett's mother.
The boy in the car?

811
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,420
So what?

812
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,420
So what if you were the last person
to see my son alive.

813
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,940
The signal was green for me.
I'll sue your family.

814
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,040
Do you remember?

815
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:23,425
Are you feeling better?
- I seem to be feeling better?

816
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:32,300
I saw the video surveillance camera...
And it seems that you spoke with my son...

817
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,040
As if to comfort
after the accident...

818
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,500
Not comfort anyone.

819
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,190
If you have not noticed,
I have other shit in the head.

820
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,040
Remember if he was
pain?

821
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,780
I will not do that, ma'am.

822
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,780
I waited a long time to
talk to you. Please.

823
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,875
Go away. Get out. Skirt.
- I can not. I can not.

824
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,860
He did not die as a hero,
if this is what want to hear.

825
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,960
Not so.

826
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,990
I do not know... Happened.
It happened quickly.

827
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,980
He asked me if it was his fault.
- And then you told him that was not it?

828
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,880
I told him not to worry.
- What else?

829
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,705
You want to know, ma'am?
- More than anything.

830
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,800
His body was trapped between the
front of my truck...

831
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,840
...and his door.
There was so much metal crushed...

832
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,535
I do not know. Perhaps this
that kept whole.

833
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,590
Did not want to move it. I think not
could, if I tried.

834
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,000
The right arm was
so behind the body...

835
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,300
...it seemed that neither was
more attached to the shoulder.

836
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,780
Never seen anything like it.

837
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,405
I had to climb to the roof of my
truck just to get to him.

838
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:20,980
I do not think he was in pain.
Just think... he was cold.

839
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,040
And then you gave him
your coat?

840
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,020
Yes, but that does not
avail.

841
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:31,560
It was o... blood...

842
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:33,880
The blood did
feel cold.

843
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:39,200
How much blood?
How much?

844
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,960
More than I ever
had seen.

845
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,960
He was terrified?

846
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,100
I do not know, I mean, there were...

847
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,740
...fluids everywhere, but...
A lot of parts out of it, you know?

848
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,840
Maybe it... Perhaps
he was crying, I guess.

849
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,060
He was crying because I was
with pain or because he was scared?

850
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,120
Does it matter?
- Which one was it?

851
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,920
Terrified, I suppose.

852
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,200
Think he knew
dying?

853
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,720
He knew he was dying?

854
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,840
He knew he was evil, but not
we speak of God or something.

855
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,300
I just told you
listen to the sirens,

856
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,735
when they hear the sirens,
everything would be fine.

857
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,220
He needed me
and I was not there...

858
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,160
I should be there to ensure
he had no fear.

859
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Want some water?

860
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,910
He needed me, called me,
and I was not there...

861
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,500
He did not call for the lady.
He called for it,

862
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,915
repeatedly, the girl
who was in his car.

863
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,040
Rose?
- Rose. Only cared about Rose.

864
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,380
If you were injured, it was
with pain, he wondered why...

865
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,780
Was telling me: 'You have to
help her, has to take care of it.'

866
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,000
But I... thought
she was dead.

867
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,460
Rose wondered why?

868
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,940
Even asked me to increase
the radio volume...

869
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,820
That poor boy had blood
leaving the ears...

870
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,620
...and wanted her to hear
the music was playing.

871
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,460
He thought that perhaps
she liked to hear it.

872
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,960
Gotta go.

873
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:56,920
Relax. You can stay here
by the time you want.

874
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,220
And Rose, I called my mother about
the former correctional institutions it.

875
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,080
This is almost nothing, I swear.

876
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,360
Hi. Is Lydia?

877
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,695
Yes, hi. Here is Shea,
I am a friend of Rose's work.

878
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,940
Rose is quite good and she
I want to tell you something... that...

879
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,120
Right. Well, not take
much of their time, then...

880
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I did not know...

881
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,920
She lost her job.
And only 15 minutes on the phone.

882
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,900
I am very sorry to hear that,

883
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
But... Rose wants
I tell you one thing.

884
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,400
What is... she is pregnant.

885
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,980
I'd say 3 or 4 months...
Yes.. She will stay with him.

886
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,840
Take care of it
for one year.

887
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:00,215
Yes.. She is dealing with this
as a true Republican.

888
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,980
She wants you to know
who is not afraid...

889
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,940
...and that is having the support
Family baby's father.

890
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:11,840
I do not know... Imagine
everything she needs...

891
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,840
Right. She wants to ask you
something.

892
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,860
Tell him all right,
if she wants to come here.

893
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,080
Tell him that's fine.
- Are you sure?

894
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,280
Yes.

895
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,120
What?

896
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,980
She wants you to ask
$ 10,000 early...

897
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,980
...and says it will help you if
you get the 10000 now.

898
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,735
Because... she thinks
this is what you need.

899
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,595
It seemed that she was happy to
know that you were okay.

900
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,080
Okay.

901
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,650
The doctor said
you can go.

902
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,960
Yes..
- Great.

903
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,275
You spoke with
Jordan Walker, is not it?

904
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,960
Yes.

905
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,960
What did you learn?

906
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,635
Bennett loved her, did not you?

907
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,040
Oh, yes...

908
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,040
I wish he had called
for me. This is so horrible?

909
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,800
I call for you...
Call for you every day.

910
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,800
I am here now...
- Oh, my God.

911
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,400
I want my son.

912
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,520
My poor, poor, poor child.

913
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,520
Okay...
It's okay...

914
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,860
I was not there
when he most needed me.

915
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,805
I could not... I could not save him.
I could not save him.

916
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,485
I could not save him.
- Look at me. Allen.

917
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,860
It was a mistake. It was a mistake. He died
on impact, he did not suffer.

918
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,260
You could not have done anything.

919
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:24,565
He did not suffer. There was no suffering.
There was nothing you could do.

920
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
It's okay...

921
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,005
We have to take it to our house.
We have to do it.

922
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,740
All places where
she could have gone.

923
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,000
I'll look for it.
- Sure.

924
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,920
Okay?
- I'm ready. I'm fine. Come on.

925
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,900
Hello. I'm Allen Brewer.

926
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,820
Wow. You really could
so drop dead handsome.

927
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,725
I am looking for Rose.
- You lost?

928
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,900
No way.
- I do not know where she is.

929
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,020
I would love to find it.
We are worried, then

930
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,460
Please tell us something...
Please.

931
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,560
It's about time.

932
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:05,145
Try the place of the accident.
She goes there every afternoon.

933
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Rose.

934
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,880
Rose. Wait.

935
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,300
Do not worry.
The baby is fine.

936
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,620
Rose...
We were worried, right?

937
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:59,720
Why? Why
bother me?

938
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,780
Why look in the yearbooks
to find the father of my baby?

939
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,840
I go.
- Do not go see it.

940
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,980
The most disgusting thing I've ever seen
just out of my body on the bus.

941
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,860
Is in labor?

942
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,300
I'm fine.

943
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,715
You did a nice progress
in a year, Rose.

944
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,860
We were worried about you.
You disappeared.

945
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,020
Do not worry,
this baby will be fine.

946
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,095
Let's take her to hospital. If
very early, we took you home.

947
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,500
I do not want to go home.

948
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,780
I do not want my daughter
growing up in a dysfunctional home.

949
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,220
How will I create it without
talk about her father?

950
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,100
Tell her not to mention
your name in front of the grandfather...

951
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,460
...because they did not accept
he is dead?

952
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,540
Or be worried that the grandmother
to choke while she sleeps,

953
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,740
because they would prefer
it did not exist?

954
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,835
Or that her uncle let samples
urine in her crib?

955
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,860
Sorry, that was not fair...
I like you, Ryan.

956
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:02,960
I like you too.
- Thanks.

957
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,230
I promise not to suffocate
in her crib.

958
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,020
I know that I was not very helpful for you
in your situation...

959
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:16,965
And if I had to do it all again,
would entirely different.

960
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,280
Rose...

961
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,980
When you have your baby,
you will understand...

962
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:33,625
...that the most horrible thing that can
happen to a parent is losing a child.

963
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,320
I am very sorry...

964
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,300
...what happened between us.

965
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,480
I really regret.

966
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,880
Please, Rose...

967
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,170
Give us a chance...
Get in the car with us.

968
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,905
Do not even know who he is...

969
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,660
The want to know?
We will tell you...

970
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,020
I want to know everything know
if he were still alive.

971
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,500
I want more memories of him.

972
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,820
We will tell all
you want to know,

973
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,725
let's talk
until the baby is born.

974
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,780
There is a picture of him on the track
athletics. He was fast?

975
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,800
My baby will be fast?
- Yes.

976
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:38,920
- How fast?
- 400 meters in 15 seconds. </ B>

977
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,000
Okay...
Okay...

978
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:00,970
He was voted 'best of all.'
Why everyone liked him so much?

979
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,020
Tell me.

980
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,820
Because he was a nice guy...
In the third year...

981
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,900
...when his friend Jack
wore glasses,

982
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,100
Bennett felt so bad for him,
which caught the eye of Allen...

983
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:19,150
...and took them to school the next day
that Jack was not the only one.

984
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,900
Who is this girl with him?

985
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,147
It was the pair of them at
the ball and it was only...

986
01:26:23,247 --> 01:26:24,540
...with her because she drank a lot.

987
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,900
Ryan.
- It's true.

988
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,860
That's good.
I liked it, that's information.

989
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:32,500
It was a very smart girl.
He studied English Literature at Oxford.

990
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,860
It was good to drink.

991
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,040
What else? What else?

992
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,180
I hated that take pictures of it.

993
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:40,980
When they took his picture,
made a horrible grimace.

994
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,580
What face?

995
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,260
It's kinda hard...
- Show me the face.

996
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,700
It's horrible.

997
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,020
He ate what was on the plate,
since that was all apart.

998
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,940
Took the pizza topping and
ate everything in order...

999
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:56,960
He was kind of weird...
- But in a very bland.

1000
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,620
When eating Cheetos,
ate them in pairs...

1001
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,300
...lest
stay alone.

1002
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,700
My God, this hurts.

1003
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,860
I used it twat
all the time.

1004
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,940
He never used dental floss,
but used a bit of cologne...

1005
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:14,820
One who found in the closet of his father,
and stayed with his smell.

1006
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,560
It's happening.

1007
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,340
Bennett has lived 17 years,
3 months, 7 days...

1008
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,650
...2 hours and 36 minutes.

1009
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,360
He broke six bones
in life.

1010
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,585
Took 3.97 GPA and has never had
a girlfriend before I met you.

1011
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,105
Its higher temperature
was 40 degrees.

1012
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,740
E... I knew from before
speak their first word.

1013
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,840
And what was it?

1014
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,960
Mom.
- Mom.

1015
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
Thank you.

1016
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,280
Thank you.

1017
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,500
Keep breathing.
It's okay, honey.

1018
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,980
Squeeze my hand if you want.

1019
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,880
Keep breathing...

1020
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,040
We soon arrive.

1021
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,880
Her name is Ruby.

1022
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,040
Hey.

1023
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,080
Hi.
- Hi.
