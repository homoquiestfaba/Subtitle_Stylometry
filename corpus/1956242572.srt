I looked Sean up.

1228
01:04:41,959 --> 01:04:43,352
And when I found him,
I asked him,

1229
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,852
"What were you trying to say
to me that day?"

1230
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:49,583
And he said,
"I wanted to apologize"...

1231
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:54,185
Which began a conversation.

1232
01:04:54,208 --> 01:04:56,936
And here we are now, wanting
to continue that conversation

1233
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,435
with people like you.

1234
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:01,435
The victim participant
in your case

1235
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:06,018
is Karen James,
sister of the deceased.

1236
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:09,602
She's obviously been living
with and processing this crime

1237
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:12,644
for many years,
but she signed up.

1238
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,102
And I can tell you
firsthand, Louis,

1239
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:18,936
to look your victim
or, in this case, a relative,

1240
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:23,977
in the eye and own
what you did...

1241
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,811
not easy.

1242
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:29,644
But I promise you,
it'll be worth it.

The three values
of restorative justice

1244

are encounter, amends,
and reintegration.

1245
01:05:38,709 --> 01:05:41,977
I shot a man,
and I robbed his house

1246
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,769
while his dying body
was in the trunk of my car.

1247
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:48,560
How do I make amends for that?

1248
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:52,018
We're not out to fix.

1249
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:55,102
You can't repair the harm
you've done.

1250
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,435
But to sit with her...

1251
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,310
to tell her how you feel

1252
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:03,310

the harm done to her.

1253
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:05,185
And to you, Louis.

1254

feeling right now.

Uh, I'll start.

Um...

1473
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,811
the last time I saw you
was in court.

1474
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:18,102
I had a lot of hatred and anger
toward you,

1475
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:21,227
and I've been wanting
for many of those years since

1476
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,185
to find a way to let that go.

1477
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,936
And being here today right now,

1478
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:30,435
even though some
of those feelings still exist,

1479
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:35,143
I can also say that I am
no longer consumed by them.

1480
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,769
And seeing you, as you are now,

1481
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:41,644
as a human being is meaningful.

1482
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:46,041
That's great to hear, Karen.
Thank you, that's great.

1483
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:57,375
Uh, thank you
for saying that, uh, Ms. James.

1484
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:03,227
And I hope you do know
that I very much regret

1485
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:05,727
what I did to your brother.

1486
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,018
It seems almost silly now

1487
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:12,143
to say that
after all these years,

1488
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,852
but it certainly is true.

1489
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:18,644

young man,

1490
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:21,583
um, when I did that.

1491
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:27,852
And I've tried, um, to use
these years here

1492
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:30,519
to learn from it...

1493
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:31,852
uh...

1494
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:35,560
to not be that person...

1495
01:20:35,583 --> 01:20:39,625
um, and to be
a better human being.

1496
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:45,143
Thank you, Louis.
That's amazing to hear.

your brother have been today?

50 years old.

was killed...

I just remember him being
a very brave man.

1502
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,060
And as you may know, there was
no real beef between us.

1503
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:16,811
It was more the groups
that we were with.

1504
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:19,727
And I just remember,

1505
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,602
uh, him being very brave
in the face of what went down.

1506
01:21:23,625 --> 01:21:25,811
Could you tell me more
about that,

1507
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:28,602
about what went down?

1508
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:31,333
You... you want me to?
Yes.

1509
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:36,060
Well, um...

1510
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,936
I was supposed to rob him.

1511
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:39,435
He was carrying cash,

1512
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:42,291
and I was selected to go get it.

1513
01:21:43,583 --> 01:21:46,268
And when he didn't give it up,

1514
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,227
uh, we started yelling, and...

1515
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:52,602
and he ended up getting shot.

1516
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:55,435
Why?

1517
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,268
'Cause he didn't do what
I told him to.

1518
01:21:57,291 --> 01:21:59,894
But why did you shoot him?

1519
01:21:59,917 --> 01:22:02,268
W-why didn't you just hit him

1520
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:04,435
or even just shoot him
in the foot?

1521
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:07,060
Well, he had a...
He had a gun, too, Ms. James.

1522
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:10,811
Still, couldn't you
have just hurt him

1523
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:13,560
instead of kill,

1524
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:16,667
instead of shooting him
in the head?

May I say something else?
Of course.

1530

I don't want you to get out.
I don't think you should.

1531

And I-I'm so sorry,

1532
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,268
I don't mean this
to be vindictive,

1533
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:41,977
because I know the law,
and I respect it,

1534
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,644
and... and... and... and I would
never try to stop it,

1535
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:49,102
but I just feel
that I have to say

1536
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:51,060
that sitting here

1537
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:55,352
knowing Mr. Menkins
is soon to be released,

1538
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:58,018
I would be lying
if I didn't say out loud

1539
01:22:58,041 --> 01:23:02,352
that I don't believe that
that is the correct decision.

1540
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,644
And... and I respect you.

1541
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:07,102
And... and I'm sure
that you are truthful

1542
01:23:07,125 --> 01:23:11,185
in saying that you are
a different person.

1543
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,602
But you killed a man.

1544
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:18,602
You shot a man point blank

1545
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,268
in the head,

1546
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,894
in his eyes.

1547
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,727

to get away with it.

You were right
about that thing with Terry.

1577
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,917
He said if I don't help him,
I'm dead.

1578
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,602

1579
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:19,060

are bullshit.

1580
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:22,394

like this, Louis.

I don't know.

Hold your ground.

1583

he know I'm looking after you.

1584

what you think.

1585

I'm sorry, but he don't.

1586

you're about to get out.

1597
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,936
What, I take the gun
out the shop,

1598
01:26:57,959 --> 01:26:59,644
so now I'm looking at
a extra 30?

1599

But you wouldn't.
How you figure?

1600
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,185

You're about to get released.

1601
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:05,268
Terry says I can get away with
it because I'm new,

1602
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:06,268
but he's lying.
