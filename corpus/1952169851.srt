1
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,600
Grandma Randolph used to smile a lot.

2
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,200
She said it was good for the heart.

3
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Grandma was the first dead person I’d ever seen.

4
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
She also said there was nothing
a smile couldn’t fix.

5
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,700
So it started. 
An endless line of relatives

6
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,200
waiting to toss dirt
on my grandmother.

7
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,200
My dad loved astronomy.

8
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Most mornings I’d wake up and find him asleep in the attic.

9
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,800
His telescope aimed at the horizon.

10
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,300
He loved watching the moonset.

11
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,500
He died when I was 9.

12
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
Relax, it's okay.

13
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,200
It's okay, honey. 
It's okay, Ryan

14
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,600
I should’ve never let him look in the casket.

15
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,800
He’ll be all right.

16
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,200
His cousin is of the same age and he didn’t cry.

17
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,400
Tossing the dirt... 
I should have seen that coming. 

18
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,300
It was all too final.

19
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
He wasn’t ready for that.

20
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
You can’t protect him from everything.

21
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
From life.

22
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
I do that?

23
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,800
In a way.

24
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,900
He keeps intact to it in his room.

25
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,000
He’s a boy.

26
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
Let him fly.

27
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,100
My dad told me the moon 
is a big magic ball of dust.

28
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,900
And I believed him.

29
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,300
I used to be able to see the Man in the Moon.

30
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,700
Until my mom gave me my dad’s telescope.

31
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Then what I found up there were a bunch of craters and rocks.

32
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
It’s weird.

33
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Sometimes, if I look at the moon without my telescope, 
I can almost see him again.

34
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,500
Almost.

35
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,300
My dad was crazy for Gordie Hawn. 
Guy who walks on water, my dad used to say.

36
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,100
Frozen, of course.

37
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Grandpa doesn’t even know Grandma is gone.

38
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Mom says that’s the silver lining of Alzheimer's.

39
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,700
Ryan, honey, why don’t you take 
your cousins outside, OK?

40
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,500
Show them how to play hockey. 
Come on.

41
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Come on.

42
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,800
Hey, did you notice one of Grandma’s eyes was open?

43
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
You know what that means.

44
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,700
One of the relatives is going to die
in six months.

45
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,700
Maybe, one of us.

46
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,300
It’s true. 
I swear it.

47
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,700
Yo, Flynnigan!

48
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Yeah, and then he goes low and scores!

49
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,800
So, you think your mom will let us go fishing in the trouter jump?

50
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey!  

51
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,200
Does he ever talk?

52
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,300
If you watch your dad get mashed by a train, you’d probably go mute, too.

53
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,700
Why? You’re having trouble understanding him?

54
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
All right.

55
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,800
I’m sorry about your Grandma. 
She was a really nice lady.

56
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
- Made us laugh. 
- It’s all right, we didn’t really know her.

57
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,400
- We… live in New Jersey. 
- Oh, then I’m really sorry.

58
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Later.

59
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,100
Dude, the fish are gonna be great. 
My cousin caught a 20-inch trout.

60
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
20 inches.

61
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, it was 18.

62
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,300
- Watch out, Ryan! 
- Get out of the road!

63
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,100
Jackass!

64
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,100
You’re all right?

65
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,500
You’re all right?

66
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,400
He didn’t really hit you, did he?

67
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,200
Are you sad, Ry? 
About your Grandma?

68
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Hey, come on, don’t worry about it, buddy,
she’s in Heaven.

69
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,300
What are you, an atheist, Flynn?

70
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Someone who doesn’t believe in God?

71
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
If you’re even thinking about it, 
that can’t be good.

72
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I mean,

73
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
if there were no God,

74
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,100
that would be harsh.

75
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Can we go for the bridge?

76
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,600
No thanks, that bridge is like a pile of toothpicks. 
Besides, it’s not even a shortcut to the lake.

77
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,100
But … Whatever.

78
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Check it out, Flynnigan!

79
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,700
Am I the master or what?

80
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,600
Look at that, 
look at that baby.

81
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,200
Oh, yeah! Oh, it’s a lively one. 
I got it, I got it.

82
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,300
Hey.

83
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
Hallo?

84
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Hallo?

85
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,700
I could really work in a killer well here, 
You’d only notice if it bit you in the butt.

86
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,400
What’s up, dude? 
You’re like a pile of molten cheese today.

87
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,500
Ryan, what are you doing?

88
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing?

89
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, you do it.

90
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Come on!

91
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
- Don’t move, don’t move. 
- That hurt.

92
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,900
I know, but what were you doing in the lake, when your hook was still cast? 
- Ask Flipper.

93
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,500
Success!

94
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,400
- Yo, Ry? 
- Ryan?

95
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
- Ryan?

96
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
See you tomorrow.

97
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,600
- Thanks, Mrs. Flynn, you saved my butt. 
- Oh, get out of here.

98
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,700
Go, go, go.

99
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Ryan?

100
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Come out.

101
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
Ryan!

102
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Ryan, get out of the car!  

103
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Oh, God!

104
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,300
Dad!

105
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
Ryan.

106
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,600
Good morning Ryan, 
where do you wanna meet?

107
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,200
All right, see you in five.

108
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,300
Excuse me, how about asking for the phone?

109
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,300
Come on, 
what is going on?

110
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Are you angry with me? What?

111
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh, Rocky will just have to wait. 
Besides...

112
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,100
I thought we had an agreement -
on the weekends we fish together.

113
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,700
All right, but next weekend it’s you and me, okay?

114
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
All right, go on.

115
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,300
Hey, slow down.

116
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,200
Ryan!

117
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,000
You’re all right?

118
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
You’re all right?

119
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Ryan!

120
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,500
Ryan, where are you?

121
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Ryan!

122
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Ryan!

123
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Grandpa Randolph?

124
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,600
Do you like the car? 
Outside?

125
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,800
When did you start talking?

126
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,500
I didn’t know I stopped.

127
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
I mean, when did you start?

128
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,000
- Where’s my mom? 
- Well, she’s not here.

129
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,200
- Am I dead? 
- No, you’re not dead, no.

130
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,800
- Where am I? 
- In your room.

131
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,800
- No, things are different. 
- Well, you must have wanted them to be.

132
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,800
- I didn’t ask for this. 
- Frankly, neither did I, some things you don’t ask for.

133
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,800
Is my dad here?

134
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,400
I don’t bite, boy, just need help getting up, please.

135
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Oh yeah, thank you, thank you very much.

136
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
- What?

137
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Your hand ... It just went through the glass.

138
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh yeah, that explains why you’ve been standing in the toilet there.

139
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,700
You’ll have to forgive me, before
the Alzheimer's this was the bathroom.

140
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,100
There was a closet. Obviously your mother renovated.

141
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
Your father was quite a stargazer.

142
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Astronomer.

143
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
He was an astronomer.

144
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Someday I’m gonna fly up there.

145
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,800
The Moon.

146
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,800
An astronaut.

147
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,000
- You have a taste for adventure. 
- I never miss a shuttle launch.

148
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,000
- Grandma said you were a dreamer. 
- Yeah, but sometimes ...

149
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,100
You have to step back to see what’s right in front of you.

150
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,600
I dream that I am good at that. 
Very good at that.

151
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,700
Well, are you coming, boy, or you’re going to stay in the toilet all day?

152
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,800
- That’s the closet. 
- Not for me.

153
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,100
- Who is that? 
- Pretty, huh?

154
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,300
- Why is she wearing a coat in summer?

155
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,600
Why don’t you ask her?

156
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,300
Go on, turtle, chase her.

157
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,500
- I’m not a turtle. 
- Prove it.

158
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,900
Ryan.

159
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,400
Come on out!

160
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,300
- What’s the matter? You won’t get wet. 
- Of course I will.

161
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,400
Of course you won’t.

162
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,000
Come on.

163
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,900
Come on.

164
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
That is so unfair.

165
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
It’s always winter for me.

166
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,200
You’re lucky, you arrived in summer. 
Give me heat any day.

167
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,200
Tahiti, now that’s the place.

168
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,500
How to do that?

169
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,900
- What’s your name? 
- Ryan.

170
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,600
- What’s yours? 
- Melanie. But I like the name Pan better.

171
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,700
Like Peter Pan, 
only a girl.

172
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,300
- Oh. 
- You do believe in Peter Pan, don’t you?

173
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,900
If you don’t, I couldn’t ever speak to you again. Ever.

174
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,100
- Why? 
- It would mean you have no imagination.

175
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
So?

176
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
- Do you believe? 
- Sure.

177
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,700
- Have you been to the factory? 
- What factory?

178
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, excellent, I get to take you!

179
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Come on.

180
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,400
What’s the matter?

181
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,900
Ryan?

182
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,000
It’s nothing.

183
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
Let’s go.

184
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Come on.

185
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Let’s go, slowmo.

186
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Pretty creepy, huh? 
He runs the show.

187
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,100
How long have you been here?

188
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,100
A while, I guess. Time is kind of unimportant here in the Dust Factory.

189
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
That’s how you call this place? 
The Dust Factory?

190
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Yup, a kind of home away from home until you’re ready to go back.

191
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,700
Which I’m not!

192
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
You’ve got to see how the big top works to understand.

193
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,500
Come on.

194
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,300
Who are all these people?

195
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,500
People like you and me. 
We’re stuck here.

196
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
Stuck?

197
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,600
It’s called getting dusted.

198
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,300
You see, when you decide to make the leap, you only get one chance to fly.

199
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,700
So, either you make it and move on, or get dusted and go back home.

200
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,400
That’s the only way to go home? To jump and miss?

201
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,200
No one’s getting me up there.

202
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,400
- Wow, so she made it. 
- Yep, she moved on.

203
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Complex, isn’t it?

204
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,000
- Hey, do you like to spin? 
- I don’t know what you mean.

205
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,300
Spin, in circles till you get queasy and see double. Spin!

206
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,700
- Bet I could ride this longer than you? 
- Yeah, right. I can go forever without puking.

207
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,700
Bet you can’t!

208
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,000
I’m gonna win!

209
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,800
Come on.

210
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,700
Oh, careful.

211
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,500
Don’t feel bad about puking. 
I always win.

212
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
I wasn’t puking. 
I was spitting.

213
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,600
- See you tomorrow? 
- Not tomorrow. Just see you.

214
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,100
- She’s a nice girl? 
- I guess. Have you been to the factory?

215
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,300
Sure. Joined the crowd once, but didn’t jump, of course.

216
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,300
Yeah, I’m definitely not big on jumping.

217
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,300
- And I don’t like that dust. 
- Can’t blame you.

218
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
Falling all that way...

219
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,900
- How do you know if you’re ready? 
- I'm certainly no expert.

220
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
I suppose it’s different for everyone.

221
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Some folks probably dawdle around here quite a while, trying to figure that out.

222
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Melanie, for instance...

223
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,400
- She... She seems a bit of a dawdler. 
- I don’t mind dawdling,

224
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,700
if it means not having to jump.

225
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,500
Hitting that floor looked awful painful.

226
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,400
You’re afraid of a little pain. 
That’s an overrated phobia.

227
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
- So, what’s it like? 
- What?

228
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,900
You know, dying.

229
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,700
I don't know.

230
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,900
Well, you must.
You’re practically dead.

231
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,900
Thank you. 
Thank you very much.

232
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,300
- It’s gotta hurt. 
- Hurt? Life hurts, boy.

233
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,500
Boxing. That’s a real pain. 
I was a boxer myself.

234
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,700
Not a good one,
but I was a boxer.

235
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,900
Come on.

236
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,800
Now box, box, box!

237
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,600
More, more.

238
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,400
You're too strong for me.

239
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,800
- I heard you called me a dawdler. 
- Not me.

240
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,300
- I didn’t. 
- Promise you didn’t?

241
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
- If it means you’re letting go, I promise. 
- Mean it?

242
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,300
Yes, I mean it. 
Let go.

243
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,800
Better mean it.

244
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,600
- Doesn’t this day ever end? 
- What do you mean?

245
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,800
Well, there is a beginning, but no end.

246
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
How do you know it began?

247
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,000
Well, it had to.

248
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,900
- Or it wouldn’t be. 
- That’s not true. It just is what it is.

249
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,000
You know, light all the time.

250
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,700
Maybe, if we run away from the sun, 
we’ll find night.

251
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,900
Let’s go east. 
That way, we’re going with the Earth’s rotation.

252
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,300
It gives us a better chance of outrunning the sun.

253
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,500
Wow, you're a Boy Scout, too.

254
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Grab your skates, slow man. We’ll have a race to the train track
from the cemetery. Maybe it’s night there.

255
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,300
- Catch up, dawdler. 
- Dawdler?

256
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,800
Cheater!

257
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,200
Catch up!

258
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,400
Get those skates over the grass.

259
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,200
That was great, wasn’t it?

260
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
You don’t like to lose, huh?

261
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,500
You don’t hate me for winning, do you?

262
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
No.

263
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,900
Besides, this is not the last race we'll have.

264
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,500
You have no idea how long I’ve waited for someone like you to come along.

265
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,600
Too long, I’d say.

266
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,800
- We didn’t beat the sun. 
- It must be night somewhere.

267
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,200
- I miss the moon and the cool breezes. 
- I love the Sun’s warmth.

268
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
I suppose you would.

269
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,300
- Make me a promise. 
- Sure.

270
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,200
- If you decide you want the 4 seasons again... 
- That means jumping at the big top.

271
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,000
- Forget it. I’m never going home. 
- But if you change your mind...

272
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
promise you’d tell me first?

273
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
Why?

274
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,100
I might consider going is all.

275
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
- Partners? 
- Partners.

276
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
- Bonjour!

277
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Oh, mademoiselle, monsieur.

278
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,300
It's been a while since I tried my green thumb,
but I think I found it.

279
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,800
Grandma died.

280
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,900
- When? 
- The other day.

281
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
- Where? 
- There.

282
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,300
- Here? 
- Well, there.

283
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,700
You’re not supposed to be down there.

284
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,900
I was supposed to go first.

285
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I suppose I messed it up.

286
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,300
It’s... it’s a beautiful day. 
There’s a celebration this evening.

287
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,100
What’s the point?

288
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,600
She’s dead.

289
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,600
Exactly, if no one celebrates her life, 
what’s the point?

290
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,900
We bring meaning to each other’s lives, and now...

291
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
Particularly your grandmother’s.

292
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,700
Here, for the great ball.

293
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,000
The formal initiation only you find, of which you’re one.

294
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,900
- You’re serious? 
- Yes, I’m serious.

295
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,700
- Is he serious? 
- Yeah.

296
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,500
- Do you dance? 
- Of course he does.

297
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,600
- You know, tangos and waltzes... 
- Of course not. I’m a guy?

298
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,200
Oh, lame-o excuse.

299
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,000
Dancing is the most exhilarating, glorificating, fantazilating. 

300
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,500

301
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,600
Just let your toes 
go tapping heels kerplanking.

302
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
It is the essence of life.

303
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
And if you think you’re too fancy, 
too grandiancy,

304
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Just let your feet

305
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
explore the floor.

306
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,900
They'll know the layout, 

307
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,500
forget yourself and play out.

308
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,400
‘Cause there’s no substitute.

309
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,600
Heck, it’s the essence of?

310
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,600
- Life? 
- Life.

311
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,400
What do you say, Ryan?

312
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,500
I guess.

313
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,800
What was Grandpa thinking? 
I can’t wear his old clothes.

314
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,800
It’s definitely out.

315
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Here. 
It’ll fit.

316
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,200
If you wanna get anywhere
you’ve gotta start using your imagination.

317
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,800
Try these on.

318
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,800
- I can always stitch them up. 
- Okay.

319
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,300
- Oh, please, I won’t look.

320
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,500
- Ready for the shirt? 
- Come on.

321
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,400
- Turn around. 
- Sorry.

322
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,200
- You wear butt-huggers? 
- Briefs, they’re cotton briefs.

323
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,200
You should wear boxers, they’re
way cooler than butt-huggers.

324
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,300
Baseball cards?

325
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,700
Hockey. 
They’re collectors’ issues.

326
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,100
There’s nothing wrong with having 
heroes.

327
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Baryshnikov, Nureyev.

328
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,300
I adore them!

329
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,000
Man, they can fly!

330
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,900
- Cool, I love astronomy. 
- Really?

331
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Wow, you’ve got your name engraved on everything.

332
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,200
It was my dad’s.

333
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
We used to watch
the shuttle launches together.

334
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
- So, do you spy on your neighbors? 
- No.

335
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,300
The stars, the Moon...

336
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Isn’t the Moon kind of close?

337
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,500
I mean, you don’t even need 
a telescope to see it.

338
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,900
I was looking 
for something more specific.

339
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,600
- What? The flag Apollo 11 planted? 
- No.

340
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,300
Did you know Galileo thought that oceans
made up the face of the Man on the Moon?

341
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
Actually, they’re lava flows.

342
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,200
I know, they’re called maria.

343
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,900
- Do you know the name of the biggest, 
nearest crater to the Apollo 11 landing? 
- Julius Caesar.

344
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,300
- Do you know when the Apollo 11 landed? 
- The summer of '69.

345
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,800
Which hemisphere?

346
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:32,000
- West. Can you name an eastern landing? 
- Apollo 15, summer of '71.

347
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,200
- Name another west? 
- 17. Winter of '72.

348
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,300
- Name a landing near Copernicus crater. 
- Apollo 12, summer of '69.

349
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,900
- And 16 landed in the spring of '72. 
- And 14 in the winter of '71.

350
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,100
We're all out of missions.

351
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,600
Wouldn’t it be fantastic to go there?

352
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,600
Someday I will.

353
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
They’ll have really fast 
interplanetary ships.

354
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,300
Yes, and who you use...
What’s that power source?

355
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,600
- Electromagnetic propulsion. 
- Yeah, that’s it!

356
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,400
Good thing you met me then, huh?

357
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,200
Every space traveler 
needs a partner.

358
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,200
Only we can’t see the Moon 
if it never gets dark.

359
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,300
Here, try this on.

360
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,700
Very handsome.

361
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,100
What are you wearing?

362
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,000
What was that for?

363
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,400
I don’t know.

364
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,600
- Bonjour!
- I’m still not used to you doing that.

365
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,400
Sorry, it’s the only way in for me.

366
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,500
Stunning. Your grandma wore a dress just like that 
the first time I fell in love with her.

367
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,000
You fell in love with her more than once?

368
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,100
- Of course. 
- How old were you?

369
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,600
Sixth grade. 
What a romance.

370
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,300
It lasted a week and then 
my family moved and...

371
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,500
And I didn’t see her again

372
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
till I went away to college.

373
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,600
Did she remember you?

374
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,200
No, not a bit, but we fell 
in love all over again.

375
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,200
- That is so romantic. 
- Yeah, my beautiful wife.

376
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,400
Let’s see it, go.

377
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,400
Is the duchess ready to dance?

378
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,300
- Shall we? 
- We shall.

379
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,000
- Ryan. 
- No.

380
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,400
You’re a quick study. 
I thought you were.

381
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
I’ve never seen him outside 
the big top before.

382
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
No.

383
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,900
Ryan!

384
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,900
Stop it! Stop it!

385
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,100
The kids...
The kids have to finish their tango.

386
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,100
What does he want with me, Grandpa?

387
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,100
Don’t fear him, boy.
It would be a mistake.

388
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,100
He is no one to be afraid of. No.

389
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,800
Ryan?

390
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,200
Ryan?

391
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,300
Melanie would love this.

392
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,400
Do you ever get bored?

393
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,800
I didn’t know I needed more than this.

394
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,800
- No, I mean knowing you’re stuck here. 
- Who says I'm stuck?

395
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,900
- Did your mother ever tell you 
about the Fair Footed Flekk? 
- No.

396
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,700
- What about the flekk? 
- The Fair Footed Flekk.

397
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,500
- Is there a point to this? 
- There will be, if you have any patience.

398
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,600
- I’m patient. 
- You have patience? Let me see.

399
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,700
Once upon a time there were three men 

400
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,600
who decided to climb the tallest 
mountain in their country.

401
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,300
- Which mountain? 
- The tallest - that's the point.

402
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:35,300
These fellows knew if they succeeded, 
they would be showered with wealth 
and power by the king.

403
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,900
- For climbing a mountain? 
- This happened a long time ago,

404
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,700
when climbing a mountain wasn't a weekend sport.

405
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,600
They even referred to the mission

406
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,100
as a "quest for paradise."

407
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,100
- This is an honest to goodness fable, huh? 
- You'll see.

408
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,700
Now, the king had a beautiful daughter, 

409
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,000
and he promised her hand to the bravest of the men. 
- So even if the guy was an ugly toad with fart's breath,

410
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,800
she'd have to marry him? 
- Yes, yes. 

411
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,900
Halfway up the mountain,

412
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,200
one of the men turned to the guide 
and said he couldn't justify 

413
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,400
the strain of another day's hiking 
just for the king's good blessings.

414
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,900
- Go on, Grandpa. 
- Go on, go on, go on.

415
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,500
The next morning,

416
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,700
the second man decided 
to climb was foolish.

417
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,700
Even if the king 
were offering pails of gold, 

418
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,200
he figured it wouldn't be 
worth spending from his deathbed.

419
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,500
So, off he went.

420
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,300
The last man... 

421
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,800
The last man was chipper 
as a fox in a chicken coop!

422
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,900
Already counting his good graces...

423
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
Anticipating wealth, wench, happiness! 

424
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,300
- The guy's stylin'.  
- Guys stylin', yes.

425
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,300
Well, his excitement was short-lived

426
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,800
as the guide outlined the final day's journey. Treacherous. 

427
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,800
This fellow just shook his head in disgust. 

428
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,800
I mean, for a spoiled child bride,

429
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,800
it would take all the king's money 
to keep her happy, anyway.

430
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,600
So, without even a proper fare-thee-well, 

431
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,200
he turned on his heel 
and left the young guide alone. 

432
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,700
And you know what the guide did then?

433
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,500
- Bailed?  
- He went for it. 

434
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,400
- Cool! 
- Cool, yes. 

435
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,100
So, then what? 

436
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,800
After two more days, he reached the precipice

437
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,800
and discovered a weathered bench 
looked out over the countryside... 

438
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,800
cupped his hands and shouted:

439
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,200
"What paradise is this?" 

440
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,400
He was answered by a beautiful voice.

441
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,100
"What paradise do you seek?"

442
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,600
- The Fair Footed Flekk?
- Yes, she skipped through the clouds 

443
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
as is she were light as air itself. 

444
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:03,500
She explained how the men 
he'd started with 

445
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
were glory seekers expecting paradise,  
but disappointed.

446
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,500
Disappointed at the price.

447
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,000
The young man was touched and moved.

448
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,100
as he looked out over 
this tiny piece of the world 

449
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,600
seeing with a clarity he'd never known.

450
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,000
And a word trembled from his lips... 

451
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,600
Paradise.

452
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,800
- And the Fair Footed Flekk? 
- Gone... into the clouds. 

453
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,000
- Memory. 
- Climbing the mountain was his reward?

454
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,500
Climbing was his paradise.

455
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,300
- You all right, Grandpa? 
- Yeah, never better.

456
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,500
I wish Melanie was here. 
She would dance for us.

457
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,300
Melanie... 
Ryan, you can dance.

458
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,400
You can dance.

459
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,700
And left on, 
and right on...

460
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,000
Left again
and right again.

461
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,600
- That’s impossible. 
- In the Dust Factory, anything is possible.

462
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,100
You just have to unlearn your can's and can'ts.

463
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,400
Besides, the walk back 
would have finished me.

464
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,100
- So, you have been getting tired? 
- And, you’re feeling stronger?

465
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
- Yeah, I guess. 
- Ever heard of conservation of energy?

466
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,600
- You can’t create it. 
- Or destroy it.

467
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,700
Just keeps moving around.

468
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,500
- As it should. 
- Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

469
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,500
Ryan. 
Come on.

470
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,900
Let’s go.

471
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,000
See you later, Grandpa.

472
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,000
Boy, boy, boy. Don’t forget, 
you’re on a quest for paradise.

473
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,800
- Careful there, partner. 
- Almost got it.

474
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,700
- What’s up with you? 
- I don’t know.

475
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,100
- I just feel great. 
- Like you’re in Neverland?

476
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:35,500
- I suppose. I never saw the movie. 
- But you get it now.

477
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,100
Now... More balance. 
Try again.

478
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,000
Balance, balance.

479
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,500
- Ryan?

480
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,600
He’s not ready.

481
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,500
- Ryan, are you okay? 
- Of course. Don’t worry, 
I’m not gonna fall in the lake. 

482
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,900
Now show me the spin move again.

483
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,400
Eyes forward.

484
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,000
- What?

485
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,400
I don’t know.

486
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,400
It’s like I forgot to do something.

487
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,600
- It runs? 
- Why wouldn’t it?  
I didn’t have butchers for mechanics.

488
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,800
Where are we going?

489
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,800
Patience. Patience.

490
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,100
- Hey, what’s with you two? 
- You don’t see any trees?

491
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,600
- No. 
- This is an orchard.

492
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,500
Hey, what’s with you two?

493
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,800
- You didn’t see any trees? 
- No.

494
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,200
Look at all the leaves.

495
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,000
My grandfather told me,

496
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,300
when a leaf floats past you 

497
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,200
it means somewhere someone 
is thinking of you.

498
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Oh, please.

499
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,400
What? You don't think anyone thinks about you?  
Oh, Melanie. You have to believe.

500
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,200
- I know what you're up to. It's not fair. 
- Oh, Melanie. Little lady.

501
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,500
I believe.

502
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
Patience, patience.

503
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,600
I don’t want this to ever end.

504
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,500
Again with that word "end". 
It's a myth. 

505
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,800
- That is a lie. 
- Don’t be selfish, Melanie.

506
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,800
When you make the leap at the big top, 
time in the Dust Factory ends. 

507
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,900
- Let Ryan decide.

508
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,800
Melanie.

509
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,500
Dust.

510
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,100
I hate it.

511
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,200
I don't wanna jump. 
And I never will! 

512
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,600
Melanie.

513
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,600
Ryan, help!

514
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:30,200
- Mel, hold, please! Hold!
- I’m trying, it’s too strong!

515
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,700
Sorry, Ryan.

516
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
I didn’t mean to bring us here.

517
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,600
Everything was gonna be perfect. 
It was gonna be just you and me.

518
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,300
Your Grandpa went and ruined 
everything with those leaves.

519
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,200
The dust.

520
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,300
You never should have messed with the dust.

521
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,900
Careful, Ryan.

522
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,200
- I think you sh...
- Ryan, I think you’re supposed to shoot.

523
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,400
Ryan, don’t leave me here.

524
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,100
Mel.

525
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,400
Grandpa? Grandpa?

526
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,200
There’s no paradise for me.

527
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,900
Fair Footed Flekks don’t exist. 
They’re all lies.

528
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,700
Where are you, Grandpa?

529
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,300
Boy, boy.

530
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,300
- Grandpa, It's Melanie. 
- She can wait. 

531
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,000
- You don't understand. 
- I understand perfectly. 

532
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,700
- But Grandpa, I left her 
in that awful place. 

533
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,700
No, her lack of faith keeps her there.

534
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,700
No, she's just scared.

535
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,400
Melanie will learn on her own. 

536
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,200
Otherwise, she'll never make the leap, 

537
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,000
and we can't dawdle here forever.

538
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,600
You're leaving.

539
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
What? I should. 

540
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,300
- I should overstay my welcome?
- But I like the way things are. 

541
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,800
- Here with you and Mel.
- No. No. You have a home,

542
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,400
a family, a life.

543
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,200
That mustn't be tossed aside 
because you're afraid of dying.

544
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,400
I won't go back!

545
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:12,000
Boy, the beauty of living 

546
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,000
is that you get to work 
all the world's myths. 

547
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,600
Let each of them tug at your insides.

548
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,500
Take a shot at answering 
the questions of life and death. 

549
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,700
When I die, I don't want it to hurt.

550
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,200
I don't see paradise, Grandpa. 

551
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,400
I want to, but I don't.

552
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,200
Patience.

553
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,700
I hear the circus clowns. 
I hear them.

554
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,000
They're singing.

555
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,000
Will I ever see you again?

556
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,700
The colors of sunset.
Warm... and cool...

557
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,200
Always extraordinary.

558
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,000
Always extraordinary.

559
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,900
Live your life,

560
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,800
Ryan Flynn.

561
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,400
No!

562
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,600
No.
No.

563
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,300
No.

564
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,000
Mel.

565
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Mel!

566
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,200
Mel!

567
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,000
I’m not afraid of you.

568
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,300
You’re afraid I could win her back.

569
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,700
I challenge you.

570
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,700
Yes!

571
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,500
Come on, Mel. Let’s go.
We’re out of here.

572
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,000
What? I beat you.
I scored.

573
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,200
I'm ready to leave, 
I proved it.

574
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,200
- What’s wrong? 
- You won, Ryan.

575
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,800
- I didn’t. 
- No!

576
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,800
You just have to believe there's more 
to life than one long winter.

577
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,300
You're asking me to risk everything! 

578
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,800
I've been here too long. 
I don't even remember where I came from. 


579
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,800
Where would I end up?

580
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
I can't handle that kind of uncertainty.

581
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,800
Grandpa would tell you to turn all that doubt into trust.

582
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,400
Take a chance, Mel!

583
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,200
Do you trust me?

584
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,500
Do you trust yourself?

585
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,000
Do you trust yourself? 
Say it, Mel!

586
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Come on, get off those toe-picks
and skate. Skate now!

587
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Meet me halfway, Ryan.

588
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,800
Grandpa took the leap.

589
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,800
Did he make it?

590
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:46,700
He made it, Ryan. 
It’s all right.

591
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,400
- Thanks for coming. 
- Special catch, he was.

592
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,700
He would've caught me if I'd done nothing 
but offer two stumps for hands.

593
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,700
What a man.

594
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,300
What a man.

595
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,600
Dad?

596
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,900
I wanted to tell you so much.

597
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,600
Remember when you showed me the man in the moon?

598
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,100
And I couldn’t see him for the longest time.

599
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,700
And then you drew me a picture of him. 
Told me his eyes were so droopy

600
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,600
because he only slept three days out of a month.

601
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,400
And that his smile was so big

602
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,200
because he loved to watch me play.

603
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,700
Ever since you told me that story, 
I wanted to visit him.

604
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,900
I really miss you, Dad.

605
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,700
Ryan?

606
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,400
He was right here.

607
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:44,000
- Ryan, it’s OK. 
- No, he was right here.

608
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,300
No!  My dad, I saw him!

609
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,100
Dad...

610
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,600
He looked so real.

611
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,600
They’re waiting for us.

612
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,300
Come on.

613
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:23,600
He’d have caught me if I'd done nothing 
but offer two stumps for arms.

614
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,100
What a man .... 
what a man ...

615
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,500
Come on. This is supposed to be 
a celebration, remember?

616
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,900
A toast, to Grandpa.

617
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,200
Not here.

618
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,000
I’m not sure I understand 
anything Grandpa said.

619
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,500
But at least I'm not afraid anymore.

620
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,200
I figure he's in eternity.

621
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,700
I almost grasp the meaning of it. 
But then it slips away. 

622
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,300
Maybe because I'm just a kid.

623
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,900
Fill it up.

624
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,400
To a wise old man, 
who’d better have not driving.

625
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,100
I never saw the Fair Footed Flekk.

626
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Do you know what she looks like?

627
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,200
No.

628
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,500
Then how do you know 
you haven't already met her?

629
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,500
Funny. 
I still don’t see paradise.

630
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,400
I wanna go home.

631
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,400
Really go home.

632
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,600
I know.

633
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And I don't want you to.

634
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,800
It was always my plan to leave too, you know.

635
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,100
But I was just waiting for a sign.

636
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,200
I figured there'd be this perfect moment 
where I'd just know it was right.

637
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,400
I guess I'm just a dawdler.

638
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,600
You know, I can still do everything 
better than you can.

639
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,400
- Faster - always will. 
- You can't always win.

640
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,100
- I'll always beat YOU.
- And I won't mind.

641
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,200
I’ll never forget you, Mel.

642
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,100
You will.

643
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,000
No, I won't.

644
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,400
See you later.

645
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,600
Not later. 
Just see you.

646
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,900
I wish I had the courage 
to climb a mountain.

647
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,400
All I have is this stupid lake!

648
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,800
It’s not winter, it's not winter, 
it's not winter! It's summer! 

649
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,300
Ryan!

650
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,700
Ryan!

651
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,200
Ryan, come on!

652
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,600
Over here, Ryan, swim!

653
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,200
You can do it! Just swim!

654
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,900
Come on!

655
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,400
Honey, when are you gonna tell him 
his Grandpa died?

656
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,400
I don’t know, he just
got out of the hospital.

657
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,100
He hardly knew his Grandpa.

658
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:30,400
That’s supposed to mean something. 
When a leaf falls...

659
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:40,900
It means you don’t need summer. 
- Oh, right.

660
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
Lewises brought their daughter home.

661
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,000
There’s a girl you’d wanna get to know, Ryan.

662
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:15,500
Got spunk. Like a good power forward.

663
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,900
A girl? 
Yeah, right.

664
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,800
You got a problem with 
girl hockey players, huh?

665
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,400
Let me hear you say it: “Women 
are the best athletes on the planet. "

666
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,800
All right, all right, all right then.

667
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,500
Women ... 
aren’t the best hockey players...

668
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,700
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say it.

669
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,800
- I give up.  Mercy, mercy. 
- Oh, mercy?

670
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:04,200
- You’re like a dog paddling. 
- No I wasn’t, I know how to swim.

671
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,800
Well, you must have forgotten 
it in there for a minute, buddy,

672
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,100
because you were paddling 
like a hound dog.

673
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,300
You know, I don’t even think 
that you knew your pulp was busted.

674
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,700
Adrenaline rushes does that to you.

675
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,900
Gosh, it’s so weird hearing you talk.

676
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:22,000
I don’t have to.

677
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,000
No, no, no. It’s good.

678
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,700
Doesn’t look like such a bad fall from here.

679
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,700
Are you kidding? 
I saw you fall.

680
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,100
You landed way up there.

681
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,400
Aren’t you coming out?

682
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,900
Do you know her?

683
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,700
No.

684
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,600
Come on, Flynnigan, go for it.

685
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,000
Your friend should see a doctor 
for that tongue thing.

686
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,000
People might think 
he’s trying to catch flies.

687
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,100
- What happened to your leg? 
- I fell. 

688
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:26,000
Off this bridge.

689
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:36,400
- Right. 
- Really, I did.

690
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:50,000
- Wow, that’s pretty cool. 
- It was an accident.

691
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,900
I had an accident. 
In my head.

692
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,300
They said it was an aneurysm.

693
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:11,300
- Is that bad? 
- Not anymore.

694
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,000
- How long do you have to wear your? 
- A couple of months.

695
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,500
You really fell off this bridge?

696
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:31,400
- Cold, huh? 
- I really don’t remember much.

697
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,700
I don't like cold weather.

698
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,900
Give me heat any day. 
There's this island called Tahiti.

699
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,900
I'm going there when I grow up.

700
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,000
No winter - just long, hot days.

701
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:50,400
I don't know. 
I kinda like fall and winter.

702
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:54,600
That's 'cause your parents told you 
winter makes you look forward to summer.

703
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,500
- Why wait nine months? 
- I suppose you're right.

704
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:06,200
But I'd still miss 
the colors and the leaves.

705
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,500
Boy, someone snowed 
you over but good.

706
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,000
Come on, Ryan.

707
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,200
- Race you? 
- Yeah, right.

708
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,400
Fair enough?

709
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,500
We’ll look like a couple of turtles.

710
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,300
So?

711
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,900
Your friend can call it.

712
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,800
Dust is a funny thing. 
It's everywhere all at once,

713
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,500
like a teeny, tiny snowstorm, 
in every ray of light.

714
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,500
Even the moon is just 
a big dust ball.

715
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,200
But you know, it's all 
in the way you look at it.

716
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:36,900
Not this way or that way, 
not forways or backways.

717
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,900
Just believe before you look.

718
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,200
The man in the moon 
has a magic all his own.
