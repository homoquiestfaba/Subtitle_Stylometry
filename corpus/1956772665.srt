Martin Reese
reporting from Kansas.

184
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:09,857
So how're those new cookies
selling for you, son?

185
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,033
They're not.

186
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,414
They're just sitting here
turning to stone.

187
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:18,451
I can't get 'em in fast enough.

188
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:20,246
Guess they go better
with coffee than with beer.

189
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,317
Hey, listen, they're
having a guest chef

190
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,284
at the lodge
on sunday night.

191
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,458
Indian food.
You want to come?

192
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,495
You've never had saag paneer,
have you?

193
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,014
Invite me when they're
serving prime rib.

194
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:29,705
Where's your
sense of adventure?

195
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:31,603
Hello, Anna.

196
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,435
Morning, Mr. Reed.

197
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:38,057
Is Emily working for you
this afternoon?

198
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,921
Sure is.

199
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:41,405
Good thing
for me, too.

200
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:41,959
The receipts always go up
when she comes in.

201
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:44,202
Missed a spot.

202
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,345
You want
to pitch in?

203
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,692
Maybe, after my rounds.

204
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,454
You make me nervous.

205
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:57,283
You want to get started
on the roll-ups?

206
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:57,837
I'm talking to all
the city council members.

207
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,046
We have a problem, Dalton,
and you know it.

208
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,910
What, those public workers
on strike?

209
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,119
Hell, one afternoon in Denver,

210
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,430
I could round up a dozen men

211
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,846
who'd be happy to earn
what we pay.

212
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,640
We pay less than
what we promised.

213
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,057
You saw the budget, Anna.

214
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,127
Big snows
didn't happen last winter.

215
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:16,337
Big tourism didn't either.

216
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,856
Well, you managed
to give yourselves a raise.

217
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,789
First one in 10 years.

218
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,446
Hey, folks, dj Dan here,
and I have a confession to make.

219
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:27,141
I consulted a vedic astrologer

220
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,315
to find out if I should have

221
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:31,007
eggs or oatmeal
for breakfast this morning.

222
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:34,631
She told me
not only to skip breakfast

223
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:37,254
but that I should
stay in bed all day.

224
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:40,395
Which is why I drove
straight to work.

225
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,018
Of course,
then I heard a report

226
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,504
of a meteorite

227
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:46,264
hitting a gas field
on the east coast.

228
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:49,025
And I can see online

229
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:51,751
that another one

230
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:53,167
has just slammed into
a farmhouse in Kansas.

231
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,377
Maybe I should have stayed
in bed after all.

232
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:59,518
Which is faster,
a bullet or a meteorite?

233
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,486
Meteorite.

234
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:03,936
Come on, em,
what's your guess?

235
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,144
Bullet.

236
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:06,421
Meteorite wins, at...

237
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:08,872
Seth!

238
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,149
I told you.

239
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,875
Which gives more warning?

240
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,394
It's a meteorite.

241
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,223
Bullet. You see
the guy pull a gun.

242
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,017
You hear
the Sonic boom.

243
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,261
Meteorite.
You hear the Sonic boom.

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,747
Go home
and write fast.

245
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,339
I'm not answering her.

246
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:29,548
Gee, that's too bad.

247
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,032
'Cause if you don't
finish the letter,

248
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,240
we can't go out later,

249
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:32,828
and it's my turn
to pick the plan.

250
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,900
Em, I don't know...
I...

251
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,733
It's okay to be nervous.

252
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:43,631
I'm not nervous.

253
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:44,529
I...

254
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,323
Seth...

255
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:46,807
We've got less than
two months together.

256
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,950
Don't you want to make
the most of it?

257
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:57,991
I'm gonna miss you so much.

258
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:08,828
I think
I can get off early.

259
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,279
I'll call you later.

260
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,875
Latte, extra foam.

261
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:21,704
And a cookie monster.

262
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:26,191
Double-latte, extra foam.

263
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,675
And this is for you
on the house.

264
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:30,850
Enjoy.

265
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,197
Whose house is it on?

266
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,061
What, now you're
giving away my cookies?

267
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:34,717
Yep. And that's why
they're buying

268
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,065
a three-and-a-half-dollar
latte here

269
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:40,481
instead of a 99-cent cup of Joe
at the diner.

270
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,484
I knew there was
a reason I hired you.

271
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,123
Hi.

272
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,022
Emily, we need to talk.

273
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:06,646
Do I barge in
on you at work?

274
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,235
No, you don't.

275
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:11,375
Then we'll talk at home.

276
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:19,313
Emily, I want you to know
why I took this job.

277
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:23,213
What difference does it make?

278
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,559
It's done, isn't it?

279
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,597
Yes.

280
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:29,633
You said we wouldn't move
until I finished high school.

281
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:33,637
That's all I wanted, mom.
That's all I wanted.

282
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,846
It's not only about
what you want, Emily.

283
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,159
Your father and I have decided.

284
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,678
Dad doesn't want
to move.

285
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,851
Did you even ask him?

286
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,025
He may not want to.

287
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,545
But he needs to.

288
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:45,547
We all need to.

289
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:51,897
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to lose a child?

290
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:54,349
I feel him all around me...

291
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,695
Tilting back in his chair
at the breakfast table,

292
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:57,731
just to tease me.

293
00:17:58,698 --> 00:17:59,801
On the front porch.

294
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:00,596
On the sidewalks in town.

295
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:01,735
It is so real.

296
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,116
It is so painfully real,

297
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:04,600
I can't stand
to live here anymore.

298
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:06,844
I feel him, too, mom.

299
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,436
It's the best part of my day.

300
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:03,313
Now, I am going to drop off
the videos.

301
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:05,971
You want to come?

302
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,111
Okay.

303
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,735
I will take that as a no.

304
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:16,084
I'm also going to
run into the market.

305
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,777
Any requests?

306
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:21,642
Maybe chocolate milk,
chocolate cookies,

307
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,230
chocolate almonds,
chocolate kisses.

308
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:26,164
Any reasonable requests?

309
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,235
White chocolate,
dark chocolate.

310
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,444
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

311
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,657
These pictures
are amazing, Anna.

312
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:39,315
What a great historical record.

313
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,040
They're a terrific contribution
to the museum.

314
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,215
It's so generous
of you.

315
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,355
But these are
family treasures.

316
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,323
Are you sure you want
to leave them with me?

317
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:47,909
I know you'll keep them safe.

318
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,912
Look at those gams.

319
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,743
What?

320
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,331
Getting ready for
your first press conference.

321
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:56,608
Come on!

322
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:57,092
I don't know
how that one got in there.

323
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:02,786
Listen, Anna,
I want you to know

324
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,719
I tried to talk Douglas
out of this strike.

325
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,239
To at least wait until
you're out of office.

326
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,931
But he can get
real bullheaded sometimes.

327
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,313
I hope he isn't making life
too hard for you.

328
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:14,109
Not at all, Miriam.

329
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:15,869
He's just trying
to make it better for you.

330
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:04,848
I think it hit main street!

331
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,541
Call the fire department!

332
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:17,654
[Miriam]: Help!

333
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:20,899
Miriam!

334
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,832
Help!

335
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,627
Can you move
at all?

336
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:29,079
I can't.

337
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,736
Okay, okay.
You'll be okay.

338
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:38,399
Okay...

339
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,883
I have to leave you
for just for a minute.

340
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,541
I'm going to
get help, okay?

341
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,199
Help!

342
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,443
Help!

343
00:21:47,444 --> 00:21:48,651
Anna!

344
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:49,859
Anna!

345
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,170
Douglas!

346
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,310
What can I do?

347
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,208
Miriam! Where's my wife?

348
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,141
Janet, call 911.

349
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:57,280
Get an ambulance
and firefighters

350
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,178
to the visitors center.

351
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,041
Miriam's hurt.

352
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,180
Okay.

353
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,044
Okay, sweetheart,
breathe.

354
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,530
Just breathe.

355
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,118
An ambulance
is on its way.

356
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:22,098
Anna, are you okay?

357
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:24,411
I'm fine.

358
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:25,758
The paramedics
are on their way in.

359
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,622
Call Jason
at the hospital,

360
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:29,382
warn him we've got
injured coming in.

361
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,418
Get Clint Corbin
over here.

362
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,385
And try to reach

in Denver.

364
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:45,605
Oh, my god!

365
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,585
Tyler!

366
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:06,107
He's in the back!

367
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,108
I can't get him from here!

368
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:08,214
Give me that!

369
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,529
Step back, step back!

370
00:23:15,946 --> 00:23:20,363
Marty, help me roll him over.

371
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:21,813
Marty, support his spine.

372
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,643
Now, you start to pull him out.

373
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,093
I'll take his legs
so we can get him out faster.

374
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:27,957
I got him, I got him.

375
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,408
Gently... gently.

376
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:32,479
Tyler.

377
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,273
It's okay.
It's okay, Tyler.

378
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:35,033
Grab his legs.

379
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:35,759
I'm right here,
I'm right here.

380
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,725
One, two... three!

381
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:40,107
Come on, Tyler.

382
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,591
Okay...

383
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:42,696
Is he okay?

384
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:43,594
Watch his head.

385
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:44,870
Is he okay?

386
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,425
We've got a pulse.

387
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,150
He's breathing.

388
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,014
We have got to get him
to the hospital now.

389
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,257
It's going to be okay.

390

[Sirens approaching]

391
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:58,678
We've got a little
boy over here.

392
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:01,128
He inhaled a lot of smoke.

393
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:03,407
This is his mother, Janet.

[Sirens approaching]

395
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,168
Carl!

396
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,378
Anna,
there have been many strikes...

397
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:11,621
Small fires
on all sides of town.

398
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,555
Several houses
are now threatened.

399
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,143
But I only have
so many fire trucks.

400
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:18,386
We have to make
some fast choices.

401
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:19,940
You have to leave
the truck here.

402
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,148
We have to protect the town.

403
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:21,977
No. You get this one
under control,

404
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:24,531
and leave
a skeleton crew,

405
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,325
and get your trucks
across town.

406
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:27,672
This place is going to go up.

407
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,190
We have to
put our resources

408
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:30,191
into saving
people's homes first.

409
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,435
[Cell phone rings]

410
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,781
Listen up, chance of plans.

411
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:35,265
We're going to redirect...

412
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:36,819
Did the hospital get hit?

413
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,029
Hey, you've reached
Emily's cell.

414
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,893
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

415
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,447
Emily, it's mom.

416
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:45,691
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

417
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:47,831
Please call me
when you get this.

418
00:24:47,832 --> 00:24:49,210
I love you.

419
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,246
It's Jason Cortez.

420
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,731
Jason, it's Anna.

421
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:54,595
We've got injured coming in,
two critical,

422
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,459
and I don't know
how many others.

423
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,565
Right by
the front door.

424
00:24:58,566 --> 00:24:59,704
Anna, we've got word
of several hits in town.

425
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,500
Call in
everyone from every shift.

426
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,743
Get a hold of Kevin Simon
and Dina McCoy.

427
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:06,883
Tell them
they're not retired anymore.

428
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:08,575
We need more than nurses, Anna.

429
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,473
We need doctors
who have worked in e.R.S.

430
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,405
All right, hand on a sec'.

431
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:12,648
Listen, I'll deal with you
in a second.

432
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:13,994
Listen, I'm handling
a situation right now.

433
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:14,996
Thank you, Marty.

434
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,254
Jack, they're going
to need help in the E.R.

435
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,394
I'm not even on staff anymore.

436
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:35,844
It doesn't matter,
this is an emergency.

437
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,364
I hear the new doctor's
very well trained.

438
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:41,021
The new doctor
is one person.

439
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:41,816
Anna, I haven't treated
any patients in half a year.

440
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,715
Ricky's death
was not your fault.

441
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:49,339
I don't know that.

442
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,548
Maybe it was something I did
or didn't do.

443
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,447
You want to look
for blame?

444
00:25:53,448 --> 00:25:55,035
Well, then,
why don't you start

445
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:55,726
with the driver
of the truck?

446
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:56,727
He was the one

447
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,280
who didn't like
the song on his radio,

448
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:00,248
so he took his eyes
off the road

449
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,559
so he could
change the station.

450
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,630
Or how about the owner
of the minimart,

451
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:05,183
where he got
his coffee that morning.

452
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,703
Maybe
he watered it down.

453
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,049
Or what about me?

454
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,328
I was the one

455
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,572
that wouldn't let Ricky
out of the house

456
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,642
until he double knotted
his laces.

457
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,609
That took
20 seconds, Jack...

458
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,438
20 seconds he could have used
to get across the road.

459
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:23,822
There are people
who are hurt right now,

460
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:26,411
who might die,

461
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:27,068
if you don't walk back
into the E.R. and help them.

462
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:30,277
Tyler is one of them.

463
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,175
Who do you think
Ricky would want

464
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:32,936
treating his best friend?

465
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:48,467
What is going on here?

466
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:49,228
I told you to prep
warm saline dressing

467
00:26:49,229 --> 00:26:51,643
and start an I.V. Line.

468
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,058
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but family waits out front.

469
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,301
And let's get some meds
on board.

470
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:55,786
And why didn't anyone tell me

471
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,305
this man's not responding
to the atropine?

472
00:26:58,306 --> 00:26:59,444
Give him another milligram.

473
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:00,928
Doc!
Doc, you gotta help my wife.

474
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,965
She was in the explosion.

475
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:03,725
She's lost a lot of blood,
and she says she's dizzy, too.

476
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:06,209
It's all right.

477
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,245
Excuse me.

478
00:27:07,246 --> 00:27:09,247
Where is the pain?

479
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,214
It's in my stomach.
The side.

480
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:12,353
Do you feel nauseous?

481
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:13,045
Okay, nurse,
take her to bed four.

482
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,184
Type and cross

483
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:15,910
and do
an ultrasound of her abdomen.

484
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:17,289
And please start an I.V.

485
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,566
Sir, you have to
wait out front.

486
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:20,258
No, I'm going
to stay with her.

487
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,053
Sir, you want to do
what's best for your wife,

488
00:27:21,054 --> 00:27:22,294
you wait out front.

489
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,882
Where is Dr. Coleman?

490
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,090
Isn't he scheduled
for a shift right now?

491
00:27:25,091 --> 00:27:26,609
Dr. Coleman
lives in Boulder.

492
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,197
He's been called in
to the trauma center there.

493
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:34,169
And you are...

494
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:35,757
Dr. Baxter,
this is Dr. Ryan.

495
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:39,898
Dr. Baxter used to
work here in E.R.

496
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:41,693
Great, it's about time
I had some back-up.

497
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,661
Look, I haven't seen
half these people yet.

498
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,663
Why don't you take burn
and pulmonary.

499
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,285
I'll handle cardiac,
trauma and lacerations.

500
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:54,464
So what've we got?

501
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,845
It's good to see you, Jack.

502
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:58,054
Right over here.

503
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:59,642
It's a meteor storm, Anna.

504
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:00,506
We've had hits in six counties
in Colorado alone.

505
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:02,956
What caused it?

506
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:05,337
Hard to say.

507
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,132
Meteors are flying around US
all the time.

508
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,100
They just don't usually
get close enough

509
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,860
to be sucked in
by the earth's gravity.

510
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:12,344
Why didn't they burn up
in the atmosphere?

511
00:28:12,345 --> 00:28:13,863
Same reason
the shuttle

512
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:14,727
doesn't burn up
on its way home.

513
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,659
Speed.

514
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,109
And the iron content
of these stones.

515
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,145
They're mostly metal.

516
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,113
They come in like cluster bombs.

517
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:22,424
With no warning?

518
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,772
NASA tracks only 7%
of near-earth objects.

519
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,808
These are part of
the 93% they don't.

520
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:28,810
Is it over?

521
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,329
No, Anna.
It's just beginning.

522
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,227
An alert's been issued

523
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,195
across the entire
western United States

524
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:36,127
for the next three hours.

525
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,645
What am I supposed to do?

526
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:40,718
What's protocol
for a meteor storm?

527
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,960
Activate
your disaster plan.

528
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,928
Already did that.

529
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:45,101
Tell people to stay indoors,
away from windows.

530
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,794
And?

531
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,623
Hope it passes you by.

532
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:58,564
Tyler's on 100% O2
and O2 sat is at 92.

533
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,777
He has partial thickness burns
on his right arm,

534
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,952
several lacerations
on his chest.

535
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:10,161
B.p.'s 90 over 60.

536
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:11,473
Do you know this boy?

537
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,753
He was my son's best friend.

538
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,340
He should be my patient, then.

539
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,586
No. He's going to be mine.

540
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:29,283
Morphine's not holding.
Up him to 1 milligram.

541
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,700
Maintain O2-7 94%.

542
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:40,054
Hey, Tyler, it's doc.

543
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:44,609
You're in the emergency room.

544
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,473
It's going to be okay.
I'm going to take care of you.

545
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:55,137
[Telephone ringing]

546
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:56,690
Come on, Emily.

547
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,588
Answer the phone, honey.

548
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:05,044
Answer the phone.

549
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:10,532
Hey, you've reached
Emily's cell...

550
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:18,746
Your wife
has a ruptured spleen.

551
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,196
We're giving her blood
to stabilize her.

552
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:21,197
Just tell me
when I can see her.

553
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:22,785
Well, the plan is

554
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:23,718
to transport her
to Boulder for surgery.

555
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,029
When can I see her?

556
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,202
You can see her
right now.

557
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,101
She's in the room
back there.

558
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:28,722
That's all I want.

559
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:29,689
And could I have a coffee...
Black this time, please.

560
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:33,141
Hey.

561
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:38,076
Hi, baby.

562
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:40,044
How are you?

563
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:42,460
Listen, you remember,

564
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:44,117
you said you wanted

565
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:45,532
to get out of town
for a couple of days?

566
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,431
Looks like you're getting
a free trip to Boulder.

567
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:49,570
We'll have to see
how he responds.

568
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,538
And Miriam?

569
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,815
She needs blood,
but she's o-negative.

570
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:54,437
We only have
two units on hand.

571
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,887
Well, how long will it last?

572
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,095
Couple hours at best.

573
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:59,166
My god!

574
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,236
Anna, we need a helicopter.

575
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:03,101
Jason's gotten nowhere.

576
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:03,862
Can you work on that for me?

577
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:05,932
Of course.

578
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:07,312
Could somebody

579
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:08,038
get Marty in here
for me?

580
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,315
Have you heard from Emily?

581
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,489
No, I just get
her voicemail.

582
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,456
Why won't she answer?

583
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:15,044
I don't know.

584
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,080
Maybe her phone's off.

585
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,219
Don't worry about her.

586
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,323
As long as she's at the cafe,

587
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:19,222
she's in
the safest place in town.

588
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:21,016
[Alarm sounds]

589
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:22,189
Hope street
hasn't been hit, right?

590
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,329
Tyler. Stat.

591
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,297
I've got to go.

592
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:27,161
Anna, what
do you need?

593
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:30,680
We've got to find a medivac.

594
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm on it.

595
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:34,858
What's his sat?

596
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,966
57.

597
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,864
He's getting airway edema
from the heat and smoke.

598
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,176
I'll call rt stat.
Get him on a vent.

599
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:44,729
And get an abg.

600
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,799
Yes, sir.

601
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,835
Oh, my god.

602
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:58,087
I understand that you are
in the middle of an emergency,

603
00:31:58,088 --> 00:32:00,434
and so are we,

604
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,436
and we need a helicopter.

605
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:03,644
Well, can't you take
more than one patient?

606
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,646
We are trying
flight for life.

607
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:06,993
The mayor is on the phone
with them right now.

608
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:07,787
We are right on your way.

609
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:16,486
Breath sounds are equal.

610
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:27,842
Secure.

611
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,712
Order a chest X-ray
for placement stat.

612
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,647
He's good.

613
00:32:48,587 --> 00:32:53,177
Hi. Your double-shot
Espresso, sir.

614
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:55,075
Oh, and I forgot
your napkin.

615
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,181
[Explosion]

616
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:58,252
Get away from the window!

617
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:22,965
Hello?

618
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:24,691
Hello?

619
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:25,658
Hello?

620
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:26,521
Vents down.

621
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:28,799
Oh, geez.

622
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:31,732
Everyone, listen to me, please.
It's very important...

623
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,389
I need a pen light.

624
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,770
Top drawer.
Other side.

625
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:35,909
The hospital
has a back-up generator.

626
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,774
And a bag.

627
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:39,569
I've got it.

628
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:13,775
Marty, my cell is out.

629
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,363
We've got to try
to reach Bob hanson,

630
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:16,916
find out how extensive
the outages are.

631
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,366
Everyone else,

632
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,954
we'll monitor channel 9,
talk on 4.

633
00:34:20,955 --> 00:34:23,785
Pack up your laptops
and join me at the hospital.

634
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:26,822
They've got back-up power.

635
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:28,099
We'll run our operations
from there.

636
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,997
Okay, vents working.

637
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,929
Get him back on.

638
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,276
Yes! Yes!

639
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:34,312
Thank you, everyone.

640
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:36,659
Any oxygen?

641
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,213
What settings
do you want?

642
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:39,491
Let's just control it.
Volume 350.

643
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:49,120
Set it for 50.
He did fine on the bag.

644
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,847
He's breathing.

645
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:54,194
It's working.

646
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:56,646
How bad's your damage?

647
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:00,236
[Anna]: From what we've been
able to piece together,

648
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:01,477
the damage is extensive.

649
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:03,100
Main street is a war zone.

650
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,308
Power plant's gone.

651
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:07,276
It's horrible.

652
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,244
How many times
have you been hit?

653
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:09,347
We've had multiple strikes.

654
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:10,797
We've got no power,
no phones.

655
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:13,351
Anna, we just lost

656
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,732
a 40-foot section
of road across both lanes.

657
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:15,871
And no way off
this mountain.

658
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:17,907
We just lost highway 40.

659
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,737
What's your patient status
at the E.R.?

660
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,290
I've got two critical
who are in need of transport,

661
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,672
but I can't get
anybody up here.

662
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:25,260
Let me contact
the air force bases,

663
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:26,847
see if I can get you
a chopper.

664
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,573
Is there anything else
I need to know?

665
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,989
It isn't over, Anna.

666
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,232
There's more coming.

667
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,923
Jack!

668
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:36,650
Where is she going?

669
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:37,204
I'm sending her to Boulder
by ambulance.

670
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,102
She can't wait
any longer.

671
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,654
You can't.

672
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,690
There's a piece of the highway
missing.

673
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,932
There's no way through.

674
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,589
Everyone, listen up!

675
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,901
We're about to get
another wave of injured in.

676
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:48,317
Where from?

677
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:50,216
Hope street.
Reed's underground cafe.

678
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,460
Emily!

679
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,462
Emily!

680
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:06,128
You can't go this way, Anna.

681
00:36:06,129 --> 00:36:08,234
I have to.

682
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:09,476
The front stairway
has collapsed.

683
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:09,960
Anna,
you've got a chance over here,

684
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:12,238
through the service entrance.

685
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,481
The building was hit
really hard, Anna.

686
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,034
There's a lot of people
trapped.

687
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:17,381
Can we get them out?

688
00:36:17,382 --> 00:36:18,416
We're going to do
our best.

689
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:18,935
Here, Anna.
Put this on.

690
00:36:18,936 --> 00:36:21,005
This way, Anna.

691
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:22,524
[Explosion]

692
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,595
We've got leaks
in the gas main.

693
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:28,288
When pockets of gas build up,
anything can set them off...

694
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,566
A spark, static electricity,
even a cell phone.

695
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:33,880
[Anna]: Is gas building up
in the cafe?

696
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,985
[Carl]: I don't know.

697
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,297
We're going to put
a sniffer down who can reach.

698
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:38,816
There's a door
around the corner,

699
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,680
at the end of the hall.

700
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,785
It leads to the back stairs,
down to the cafe.

701
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,512
If we can clear a path,
we should be able to reach them.

702
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:48,206
Emily's down there, isn't she?

703
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,104
We'll do everything we can.

704
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:52,830
I give you my word.

705
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,141
Got a reading
off the sniffer yet?

706
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:55,143
Down this way.

707
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:00,113
Here's where
the stairs would be,

708
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:00,839
but the upper floors collapsed.

709
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,909
Oh, my god.

710
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,773
Carl. Anna.

711
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:05,671
Gas is seeping in.

712
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,745
We're going to have to
dig them out.

713
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:13,540
We can't risk it.
We can't.

714
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,921
If we throw off one spark,
and the whole place blows.

715
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:18,235
And you know

716
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,374
what happens
to those people

717
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,685
when the oxygen
gets displaced?

718
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:21,515
At 20% gas,
they get dizzy.

719
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:22,963
At 40%, they'll vomit.

720
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:24,724
At 60%,
they are dead.

721
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,277
Can we shut off the flow
to the neighborhood?

722
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:28,659
All the shut-off valves
are underground.

723
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,143
I wouldn't know
where to look.

724
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,178
Who would?

725
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,388
Public works.

726
00:37:34,493 --> 00:37:39,325
I don't understand.

727
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:39,912
Why can't you do
the surgery here?

728
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,120
Because
we're not surgeons.

729
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,501
This isn't a trauma center.

730
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:44,675
You've been saying that
all afternoon.

731
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:45,745
We don't have an O.R.
or an anesthesiologist.

732
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:47,402
Then you bring
those people here.

733
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:48,437
We can't.
The roads are closed.

734
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:50,439
There is no access.

735
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,958
Look, we are still hoping
for a helicopter.

736
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:53,994
And where is it?

737
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:55,789
Doug.

738
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,343
Anna's working on it
right now.

739
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:58,172
Excuse me,

740
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,210
I have
another patient.

741
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:17,847
Jack.

742
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,262
I'll be right there.

743
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:25,302
Be honest with me.

744
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,580
Without surgery,
she only has a couple of hours.

745
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:38,625
So you're saying...

746
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:42,042
That if I have
something to say to her,

747
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,148
I need to say it now?

748
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:11,969
Miriam.

749
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,764
Douglas.

750
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:15,179
Can we help you, chief?

751
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,837
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

752
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:19,253
Miriam is injured.
This is not a good time.

753
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,531
We've got a big problem.
There's a gas leak in town.

754
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:25,534
Well, I'm sure
the fire department

755
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,087
can figure out
how to shut off a valve.

756
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:28,469
It's a main valve
that's leaking.

757
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:31,782
Douglas.

758
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:32,818
I'm not on duty.

759
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,302
I'm afraid you're going
to have to be.

760
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,857
People's lives are at stake.

761
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:51,319
Would you step outside,
please, sheriff?

762
00:39:56,048 --> 00:40:00,535
I will not leave my wife.

763
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:02,191
You don't have
a choice.

764
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,917
Put him in the Van.

765
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:04,953
Don't touch me!

766
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:05,644
Don't take another step.

767
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:07,231
Clint!

768
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:07,922
Anna, let me
handle this.

769
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,993
He's refusing
to safeguard the public

770
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,719
in a crisis.

771
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,238
You activated
the security plan.

772
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:14,998
You ought to know
its provisions.

773
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:16,620
Stop.

774
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:17,759
Clint, I want you to leave
the hospital.

775
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,450
I want to talk
to Douglas alone.

776
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:19,451
I will handle this.

777
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:39,850
It doesn't
look good, Anna.

778
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,679
If we don't get her
off this mountain...

779
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,577
I know.

780
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:43,992
I've got Marty and Jason
working on a medivac.

781
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:46,857
Douglas, I am so sorry
about the timing of this,

782
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,101
but I need you
to come to the cafe

783
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:52,379
and turn off the gas.

784
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,278
You can't ask me
to leave my wife

785
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,382
to go help people
who wouldn't help me.

786
00:40:55,383 --> 00:40:55,901
I'm not asking you
to help them.

787
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,870
There are other people
who are trapped down there,

788
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,354
and they're running
out of time.

789
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:02,838
Emily one of them?

790
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,909
Douglas...

791
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,016
Hey, baby.

792
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:10,363
I'm right here.

793
00:41:10,364 --> 00:41:13,021
I'm right here.

794
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:14,057
Douglas, go.

795
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:22,375
There are
six regulator stations

796
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,688
for the town.

797
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:25,827
The one that handles this area
is right here.

798
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:27,829
It's Chestnut street.

799
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,831
Now, to shut this sector off
from inside the station

800
00:41:29,832 --> 00:41:32,247
takes electricity.

801
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:33,491
Can we bring in a generator?

802
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:35,871
No. Not with
unmapped leaks in the line.

803
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:36,873
It's just not safe.

804
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:39,082
So I got to get down
to the manual shut-off valve

805
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:39,980
down in the sewer.

806
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:41,808
Once I cut the flow,

807
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,259
we'll need to burn off

808
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:44,950
whatever gas
is left in the line,

809
00:41:44,951 --> 00:41:46,295
so any businesses

810
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,365
that are supplied
at 2 p.S.I. And above,

811
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:49,782
they should turn
their gas on full.

812
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:51,680
That's the bakery,
the diner and the lodge.

813
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:53,337
What if we get everyone
in the area to burn off gas?

814
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:55,788
That's a good idea.

815
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:56,961
We could get into that cafe
faster.

816
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:58,032
Let's go.

817
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:07,075
Carl, I'm in. Over.

818
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:09,664
It's going up too fast, Carl.

819
00:42:09,665 --> 00:42:12,149
How much longer
can they be down there?

820
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,875
We've got about 10 minutes.

821
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:21,020
Carl, can you hear me?

822
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,469
Yeah. Douglas. Douglas.

823
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,816
Do you copy?

824
00:42:23,817 --> 00:42:24,989
Roger.

825
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,715
Carl, I'm at 60%.

826
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:28,337
Roger that.
I got you, I got you.

827
00:42:28,338 --> 00:42:30,270
I'm at 70%
now, Carl.

828
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,272
It's climbing fast.

829
00:42:32,273 --> 00:42:33,171
75. Still going up.

830
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,208
Why is he moving so slowly?

831
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:39,970
He's got to, Anna.

832
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:40,971
If he creates one spark,
he blows up the whole place.

833
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:42,800
We broke 85.

834
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:44,940
Douglas,
what's your 20?

835
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:45,424
I can see it.
I can see the valve, Carl.

836
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,567
Doug,
you all right?

837
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:53,881
I'm fine. I'm fine.

838
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:04,892
The valve is off.

839
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:07,342
Repeat,
the valve is off.

840
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,309
Tell your men
to move, Carl.

841
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,346
Okay. The main is off.

842
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:11,796
Go ahead and burn out
the system.

843
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:22,772
Carl!

844
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,257
Is it dropping?

845
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:29,641
Take a look.

846
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:30,883
It's falling.

847
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:31,643
Men, let's get ready to go.

848
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:32,644
It's at 10.

849
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:36,372
Okay, men, let's move it!

850
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:03,812
Any word on Emily?

851
00:44:03,813 --> 00:44:04,917
No. And your father
hasn't come up either.

852
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:07,678
It'll be okay.

853
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,679
They're both going
to be okay.

854
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,165
Dad!

855
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,615
I got him,
I got him.

856
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:14,893
He's going
to be okay.

857
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:17,239
He'll be all right.

858
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,379
Come on, dad.
Sit down here.

859
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,659
Here you go.

860
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,661
I'll come
to the hospital.

861
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:28,148
Douglas.

862
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:34,084
You did the right thing
coming down here today.

863
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,500
Now it's our turn.

864
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:38,467
Here's your contract.

865
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,745
We all signed it,
every last one of US.

866
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:40,816
We all want to say
we're sorry.

867
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:42,680
I personally want to say thanks.

868
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:44,958
Anna.

869
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,272
Are you looking
for Emily?

870
00:44:49,963 --> 00:44:52,585
Yes. Where is she?

871
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:53,518
She asked
for the afternoon off.

872
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,932
It was slow, so I let her go.

873
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,623
Go? Go where?

874
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:57,418
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

875
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:16,402
I can't move it.

876
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,231
Use your legs.

877
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:20,889
Come on

878
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,684
if a meteorite can
knock down a tree,

879
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:23,272
you should be able
to push it with your legs.

880
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:33,453
It won't budge.

881
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:36,077
Emily,
in my trunk,

882
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,803
there's a crowbar.

883
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:39,149
Go grab it.

884
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,944
Okay.

885
00:45:40,945 --> 00:45:41,773
Wait, wait, wait...

886
00:45:44,362 --> 00:45:45,294
Keys, keys, keys.

887
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:06,314
I got it!

888
00:46:06,315 --> 00:46:07,005
Use it as a wedge right there.

889
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:12,113
Pry it in...

890
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,252
Ready...

891
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:14,287
One, two...

892
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,565
Three!

893
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:24,781
I don't think
it's going to move.

894
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,230
Try it again.
Try it again!

895
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,853
Hang on.

896
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:43,316
Hang on, I got an idea.

897
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:44,663
Where are you going?

898
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:58,711
Okay, okay...

899
00:46:58,712 --> 00:47:00,402
Okay,
I'm going to tie the rope...

900
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:02,197
Are you okay?

901
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,856
Yeah, I'm okay.

902
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:06,685
I'll tie it
around the tree...

903
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:10,757
I'm going to loop around
that branch right there,

904
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:12,173
and then I'm going to tie
the other end to your car.

905
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:14,796
I'll back it up,

906
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:16,004
and you'll be able
to slide out.

907
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:16,488
How are you going to back up?

908
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:18,593
What do you mean?

909
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:19,491
Release the brake
and put it in reverse.

910
00:47:19,492 --> 00:47:21,286
You can't drive, Emily.

911
00:47:22,011 --> 00:47:22,978
How hard can it be?

912
00:47:22,979 --> 00:47:24,185
My car's a stick.

913
00:47:24,186 --> 00:47:25,359
Oh.

914
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:31,572
I understand that
we're in a disaster here,

915
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,885
but your nurses can't even get
a proper set of vitals.

916
00:47:34,886 --> 00:47:37,405
How am I supposed to do my job
if they can't do theirs?

917
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:39,269
We're all under a lot
of stress here, doctor.

918
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,064
You know what...

919
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:42,375
Just have all the vitals
rechecked.

920
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:42,860
And make sure
they're done right.

921
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:58,288
This town's just a pit stop
for you, isn't it, Dr. Ryan?

922
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,567
Excuse me?

923
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:03,086
In for a few years,

924
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:03,742
spend some time
on the slopes,

925
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:05,226
then out you go?

926
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:05,883
But for the rest of US,
this is home.

927
00:48:06,745 --> 00:48:08,815
We were born here,

928
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,472
we raised
our families here.

929
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,405
Sometimes,
we Bury our children here.

930
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:14,131
So when we come to work
at this hospital,

931
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:15,892
it's with mutual respect.

932
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,549
Natalie Darwin
has 32 years' experience

933
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:21,311
in emergency medicine.

934
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:22,864
Sandy's been an aide for 17.

935
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:25,039
Dina and Kevin
had over 40 years between them

936
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,111
before they retired.

937
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:30,596
And Laura...

938
00:48:30,597 --> 00:48:32,770
Laura hasn't missed a single day
in 37 years.

939
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:36,119
That's over a hundred years
experience, doctor.

940
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,501
I've found that to be
a good number in a crisis.

941
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:54,792
You got it?

942
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:57,105
Yeah.

943
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:58,107
Yeah, I got it.

944
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:06,321
[Engine turns over]

945
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:09,117
[Engine revs
and clunks to a halt]

946
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:12,362
That's not reverse.

947
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,157
Yeah. No kidding.

948
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:16,538
Put the clutch
to the floor

949
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:17,092
and shove the stick
all the way to the right.

950
00:49:17,093 --> 00:49:19,576
Right. Clutch in.

951
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:22,820
Now ease on the gas
as you ease off the clutch.

952
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:26,583
Ease on the gas.

953
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:27,756
Ease off the clutch.

954
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,620
Come on.

955
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:30,967
Got it?
Keep it going!

956
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,969
[Screaming]

957
00:49:34,488 --> 00:49:35,351
Seth, are you okay?

958
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:37,871
The key word was "ease."

959
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:40,908
Just try again.

960
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:49,778
Okay.

961
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,747
Ease on the gas,
ease on the clutch.

962
00:49:52,748 --> 00:49:54,369
That's it.
Keep it going.

963
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,302
That's it!
Keep it going!

964
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:57,373
Keep it going!

965
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:04,483
Oh! You piece of crap!

966
00:50:04,484 --> 00:50:06,450
Well, that's useful.

967
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:08,004
Insult my car.

968
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,764
Seth, tell me you're okay!

969
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,353
I'm okay.

970
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:21,155
Seth, I think I figured out
what the problem is.

971
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,227
The tires are slipping

972
00:50:24,228 --> 00:50:25,331
because there's
too much snow here.

973
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:27,921
Use the crowbar
to chip away at the ice.

974
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,130
You know, Seth, coming up here

975
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:33,132
to be alone with you
at your grandpa's trailer...

976
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,272
This is not how I thought
this day was going to go!

977
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:37,827
Actually, em,

978
00:50:40,485 --> 00:50:41,176
it wasn't going to go
how you thought anyway.

979
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:43,142
What?

980
00:50:43,143 --> 00:50:43,695
I wasn't
going to go through with it.

981
00:50:46,767 --> 00:50:49,286
I wasn't going
to sleep with you.

982
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,563
Why not?

983
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:54,153
Because you said yes

984
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:55,465
for all
the wrong reasons.

985
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:57,950
Why was today
going to be the day?

986
00:50:57,951 --> 00:51:00,332
Because you found out
you were going to move?

987
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,196
You had a fight
with your mom?

988
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:02,990
When we sleep together...

989
00:51:03,957 --> 00:51:07,547
I want it to be about US.

990
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,894
[Monitors beeping rapidly]

991
00:51:13,622 --> 00:51:16,314
[Janet]:
Jack, what is it?

992
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:18,246
What's going on?

993
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,247
Jack!

994
00:51:19,248 --> 00:51:20,284
Let me go!

995
00:51:22,424 --> 00:51:23,527
[Nurse]:
Tyler's going to be okay.

996
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:25,598
What is he doing?

997
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,670
I need an 18-Gauge needle
right now

998
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,810
and set me up for a chest tube.

999
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,990
He's got a tension pneumo.

1000
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:38,992
If we don't get the air out now,
we're going to lose him.

1001
00:52:01,187 --> 00:52:04,776
[Regular beeping]

1002
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:29,662
He's stable, Janet.

1003
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:30,457
His lung collapsed,
but we got it reinflated.

1004
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,911
I've upped him
2 milligrams morphine,

1005
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:39,120
so he's comfortable.

1006
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:41,261
He's going to pull
through this, Jack, isn't he?

1007
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:46,886
He inhaled
a lot of smoke.

1008
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:48,371
Until he's breathing
on his own again

1009
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:50,925
and his oxygen levels come up,

1010
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:52,685
I can't be sure.

1011
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,100
He needs some time
on the ventilator.

1012
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,757
He had his heart so set
on that camping trip.

1013
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:59,692
Every day,
he would pull out the book

1014
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:01,315
with the trees and the birds,

1015
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:03,903
a map to the sky,

1016
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:05,698
you know that one
with the little wheel?

1017
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,356
He got that from Ricky,
a love of the sky.

1018
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:16,088
God, I'm sorry.

1019
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:17,124
I'm sorry, Jack.

1020
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:21,059
I wanted to be strong, I did.

1021
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:27,411
I can't lose him, Jack,
I just can't.

1022
00:53:33,037 --> 00:53:37,385
How do you survive
the loss of a child?

1023
00:53:37,386 --> 00:53:40,595
I don't know.

1024
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:42,322
I don't know if you ever do.

1025
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:46,222
I haven't.

1026
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,914
I think
a part of you never does.

1027
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:50,710
The rest of you just keeps
limping along day after day.

1028
00:53:52,436 --> 00:53:54,507
When Ricky died,

1029
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:58,337
I didn't know
what to do or say

1030
00:53:58,338 --> 00:53:59,683
to help you and Anna.

1031
00:53:59,684 --> 00:54:01,651
Really?

1032
00:54:01,652 --> 00:54:04,654
You were the first one
to come over

1033
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:06,587
and the last one
to leave every night.

1034
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:08,347
You answered the phone for US
when we couldn't.

1035
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:12,075
When people started flooding in,

1036
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:13,076
you made sure there was coffee
on the stove.

1037
00:54:13,077 --> 00:54:14,320
Emily was never alone.

1038
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:17,080
You brought US meals every day.

1039
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:18,324
Oh, my casseroles!

1040
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,912
Oh, god, they're awful.

1041
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:24,951
Well...

1042
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,849
No, it's true.
They are.

1043
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,644
Tyler hates them.

1044
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:30,301
Hey, we ate 'em
and we were grateful.

1045
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:34,547
Jack...

1046
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:41,069
Please just tell me

1047
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:41,795
when this nightmare's
going to be over.

1048
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:43,314
I can't.

1049
00:54:44,211 --> 00:54:47,455
You have to be hopeful, Janet.

1050
00:54:47,456 --> 00:54:49,319
Tyler needs you to be hopeful.

1051
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,804
That's your job, okay?

1052
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:53,945
Okay.

1053
00:55:00,883 --> 00:55:05,162
This is
mayor Anna Davenport,

1054
00:55:05,163 --> 00:55:07,510
talking to you

1055
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:08,270
from our emergency
broadcast station,

1056
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,064
kcxn 1610 radio.

1057
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:14,689
At 4:15 this afternoon,

1058
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:16,485
our town was hit
by a shower of small meteorites.

1059
00:55:18,384 --> 00:55:23,595
Less than an hour later,
more rocks fell.

1060
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:26,460
The damage has been severe
but localized.

1061
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:30,360
Both the power plant
has been hit,

1062
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:31,672
knocking out most of the
electricity in the county.

1063
00:55:31,673 --> 00:55:34,744
We've got a broken water
main

1064
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:36,988
and are being advised

1065
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,921
to boil water
before drinking it,

1066
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,440
or just drink bottled water
until further notice.

1067
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:42,615
There have been some
casualties and many
injuries.

1068
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:49,068
Dr. Ryan and Dr. Baxter
are at the hospital,

1069
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:51,277
treating patients,

1070
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:52,900
but they need blood...

1071
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:55,109
Every type and a lot of
it.

1072
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:55,938
So if you can,
please come in and give.

1073
00:55:57,595 --> 00:56:02,012
For those of you who cannot
stay in your homes,

1074
00:56:02,013 --> 00:56:03,601
or don't want to be
alone,

1075
00:56:04,844 --> 00:56:06,741
we're setting up
a temporary shelter

1076
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:08,812
at the cottonwood
community church.

1077
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:10,711
Millie wildflower will be
coordinating efforts there.

1078
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:14,508
For those of you
who are afraid

1079
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:17,649
that more rocks may fall

1080
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,340
and are thinking about
getting out of town,

1081
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,894
well, that's
no longer possible.

1082
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,551
One of the impacts took out a
piece of highway 40

1083
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:26,348
about six miles
down the mountain.

1084
00:56:27,522 --> 00:56:29,662
Even if you could
get off the mountain,

1085
00:56:31,629 --> 00:56:33,975
it wouldn't keep you safe.

1086
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:36,599
There have been reports

1087
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,428
of rocks falling
all over Colorado,

1088
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:40,775
with an alert

1089
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:41,845
for continued activity
in the sky.

1090
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:44,503
So what are we left to
do?

1091
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:46,436
Where do we turn
when we cannot run?

1092
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:49,405
I hope to each other.

1093
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,234
Don't wait to hear from
me.

1094
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:53,201
Look in on your neighbor.

1095
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:54,582
Share whatever food and water
you have.

1096
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:58,172
It comes from the Bible:

1097
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:02,038
"Two are better than one,

1098
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:04,765
"for if they fall,
one will lift the other up.

1099
00:57:04,766 --> 00:57:07,941
And a three-fold rope
is not easily broken."

1100
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:11,911
We are a town of 1900.

1101
00:57:12,981 --> 00:57:14,948
We are not easily broken either.

1102
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:24,993
Seth?

1103
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:26,788
Seth?

1104
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:29,756
There is one last thing
I'd like to say.

1105
00:57:29,757 --> 00:57:31,586
Seth?

1106
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:34,829
I'm the mayor of cottonwood,
but I'm also a mother.

1107
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,935
Emily, wherever you are,
please, keep yourself safe.

1108
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,081
Please, sweetie, be safe.

1109
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:47,393
[Anna]: My daughter, Emily,
is missing.

1110
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:49,362
If anyone knows where she
is,

1111
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:53,986
please come to the hospital
and let US know.

1112
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:57,369
And, em, if you can hear me,
I love you.

1113
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:01,338
And I will find you.

1114
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:05,273
All the way to the right...

1115
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,483
Ease off the clutch.

1116
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,381
Keep it going.

1117
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:11,141
That's it.

1118
00:58:11,142 --> 00:58:12,454
Okay, that's it.

1119
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:22,014
I'm out!

1120
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:23,153
Emily!

1121
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:24,501
Emily! Emily!

1122
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:28,988
Emily!

1123
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:33,129
Seth!

1124
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:34,372
Em...

1125
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:38,238
Seth, I did it.
I got you out!

1126
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:39,860
Oh, god.

1127
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:41,482
No!

1128
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:42,311
Oh, my god,
I'm so sorry.

1129
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:55,738
Better?

1130
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:56,878
Yes.

1131
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:23,698
How's his blood gas?

1132
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:26,804
His c-o-2 is 49
and his p-h is 7-3-2.

1133
00:59:31,637 --> 00:59:32,810
Natalie, can you resecure
his e.T. Tube?

1134
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:38,608
Oh. Yes, doctor.

1135
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:39,506
I'm thinking of upping
his vent rate.

1136
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:45,028
Yeah. I wouldn't
recommend that.

1137
00:59:45,029 --> 00:59:47,618
Why not?

1138
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:51,414
Well, he's already had
a tension pneumo.

1139
00:59:51,415 --> 00:59:54,797
A slightly low o-2 level
won't kill him,

1140
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:55,384
but if we blow out
his other lung...

1141
00:59:56,523 --> 00:59:59,009
I'd leave his
airway pressure down.

1142
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:01,494
When I was at sc,

1143
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,084
I was working on a study
on permissive hypocapnia

1144
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:07,637
in kids with chest trauma.

1145
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:08,845
There were many fewer
lung complications.

1146
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:11,608
Why haven't I
seen this study?

1147
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:13,679
It's still underway,
hasn't been published yet.

1148
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:17,614
Look, I know
it goes against your gut.

1149
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:20,650
It went against mine, too,
until I saw the early results.

1150
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:23,998
But it's what Tyler needs.

1151
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:24,897
How long have you been
out of residency, doctor?

1152
01:00:27,554 --> 01:00:29,971
Three years. Why?

1153
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:32,318
You know when I said
a hundred years experience

1154
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,977
can be a helpful number?

1155
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,980
Three can be helpful, too.

1156
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:41,948
Let's do it.

1157
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:49,265
Thank you for coming.

1158
01:00:49,266 --> 01:00:50,508
What are you
doing here?

1159
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,305
You asked the citizens
of this town to give blood.

1160
01:00:55,306 --> 01:00:56,376
I'm here to give blood.

1161
01:00:56,929 --> 01:00:59,620
I'm sorry.

1162
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:00,656
I shouldn't have had
my back up.

1163
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,623
Around me,
you always seem to.

1164
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,176
Franny?

1165
01:01:04,177 --> 01:01:06,662
Are you okay?

1166
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,422
I'm fine, Mrs. Baxter.

1167
01:01:08,423 --> 01:01:10,148
Do you know
where Emily is?

1168
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:13,530
She left work early.

1169
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:14,671
Why? Where
was she going?

1170
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:16,499
She didn't say.

1171
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,260
She didn't say.

1172
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:19,917
They didn't say.

1173
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:25,267
She was with Seth.

1174
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:30,963
You scan. I'll drive.

1175
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:32,998
What?

1176
01:01:32,999 --> 01:01:35,104
I put a tracking device
on Seth's car.

1177
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:36,382
Makes it easy to keep tabs
on a teenage boy.

1178
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:39,971
Isn't that
invasion of privacy?

1179
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:41,420
You want to question me
about the way I raise my kid,

1180
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:43,043
or you want to find yours?

1181
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:43,872
What button do I push?

1182
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:54,641
I'm getting a reading.

1183
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,608
Show me.

1184
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:58,575
They're at
my dad's trailer.

1185
01:01:58,576 --> 01:02:00,440
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

1186
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,961
Are these things expensive?

1187
01:02:16,594 --> 01:02:20,839
I need you
to start the car.

1188
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,015
Okay.

1189
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:25,465
Now, I need you to shift
while I call out the gears.

1190
01:02:25,466 --> 01:02:28,536
You ready?

1191
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,262
Put her into first.
That's third.

1192
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:31,126
Back to the left and up.
Good.

1193
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:33,610
Now to second.

1194
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:34,198
All right,
here we go. First.

1195
01:02:37,305 --> 01:02:40,998
Second.

1196
01:02:41,688 --> 01:02:43,620
Third!

1197
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:44,622
Okay, second.
Back to second.

1198
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:53,976
Why wouldn't they
have called?

1199
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:55,736
A cell doesn't get
reception up here.

1200
01:02:55,737 --> 01:02:58,946
They'd need to have
a radio.

1201
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,154
They must have know
that something's happening.

1202
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,777
They would have tried
to get back to town.

1203
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,675
Maybe they thought
it was safer up here.

1204
01:03:03,676 --> 01:03:06,091
Maybe they tried to get back
and they couldn't.

1205
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:07,748
They've had an accident.

1206
01:03:07,749 --> 01:03:09,508
Or they've been
struck by rocks.

1207
01:03:09,509 --> 01:03:10,786
Would you keep
those thoughts to yourself?

1208
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,822
Why is it our kids
can't stand to be apart,

1209
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:16,964
and we can't stand
to be together?

1210
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:20,381
We've never even had
a civil conversation.

1211
01:03:20,382 --> 01:03:22,970
What do you want to talk about?

1212
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:25,421
Well, did Seth say anything
this morning?

1213
01:03:25,422 --> 01:03:29,356
We had some words.

1214
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:30,496
Not about Emily.
About his mother.

1215
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:41,644
I didn't know Molly very well.

1216
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:43,026
We were always friendly
when we saw each other in town.

1217
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:47,719
I know.

1218
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,998
I never really understood
why she left.

1219
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,620
I know that, too.

1220
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:56,072
She said
she didn't want

1221
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:58,386
to live in a small town
the rest of her life.

1222
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:00,974
Called it provincial.

1223
01:04:00,975 --> 01:04:04,805
Hopeless.

1224
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:06,600
She didn't think about her son
who had his friends here.

1225
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:10,535
Or the husband with a job here.

1226
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:12,295
I don't begrudge her
her ambition.

1227
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:15,643
I just wish she'd...

1228
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:16,922
Told me before we had Seth.

1229
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:23,824
So did Emily say
anything to you?

1230
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:26,206
Nothing.

1231
01:04:26,207 --> 01:04:29,002
She wouldn't even speak to me.

1232
01:04:29,003 --> 01:04:31,797
She's so angry
because I want to move, too.

1233
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:35,388
Sometimes I wonder what kind
of mother I've been to her.

1234
01:04:36,562 --> 01:04:39,322
We may not agree
on much of anything, Anna,

1235
01:04:39,323 --> 01:04:43,223
but my son should've been
so lucky

1236
01:04:43,224 --> 01:04:43,914
as to have a mother like you.

1237
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:46,227
[Beeping]

1238
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:51,024
It's making a sound.

1239
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,681
It's okay.
He's coming down the mountain.

1240
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,925
We're on the same road
as they are.

1241
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,031
Third.

1242
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:02,968
Seth, look out!

1243
01:05:03,761 --> 01:05:04,797
Something wrong.

1244
01:05:06,972 --> 01:05:08,421
I've lost the signal.

1245
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:16,395
Seth?

1246
01:05:16,878 --> 01:05:17,982
Emily?

1247
01:05:17,983 --> 01:05:19,018
Seth!
Emily!

1248
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:20,881
Seth!

1249
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:21,987
Seth!

1250
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:26,750
Emily...

1251
01:05:29,615 --> 01:05:30,581
[Clint]: Easy now.
It'll be okay.

1252
01:05:30,582 --> 01:05:34,033
I got you. I got you.

1253
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:35,862
Come on, come on,
come on.

1254
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:39,211
It's okay.
I've got you.

1255
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:50,083
He sounds sounds clear.

1256
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,671
He's at full saturation.

1257
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:53,777
Jack. Emily's hurt.

1258
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,437
She's going
to need you

1259
01:05:59,438 --> 01:06:00,370
to be her dad,
not her doctor.

1260
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,785
Oh, Emily. Oh, baby.

1261
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:03,994
She been in
an accident.

1262
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:06,133
It's going to be
all right.

1263
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:07,238
Dr. Ryan here's going
to stitch you up.

1264
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:09,447
Doctor.

1265
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:11,138
Why not you?

1266
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,484
'Cause if screwed up.
You'd never forgive me.

1267
01:06:12,485 --> 01:06:14,521
You'll be all right,
sweetie.

1268
01:06:14,522 --> 01:06:16,005
It'll be okay.
Go with her.

1269
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,559
Seth.

1270
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,113
Can you walk?
Okay. Come on.

1271
01:06:20,114 --> 01:06:21,460
Let's get you cleaned up.

1272
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,186
Is it just your head?

1273
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:29,294
I'll hold it steady.
Hop right up there.

1274
01:06:29,295 --> 01:06:31,572
Good girl! Okay.

1275
01:06:31,573 --> 01:06:32,022
You're going to be
fine, sweetheart.

1276
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:40,512
How's Tyler?

1277
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:42,376
He's okay for now.

1278
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:43,447
Let's sit down.

1279
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:58,393
Did you write that letter?

1280
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:02,810
Excuse me?

1281
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,227
I asked you to write a letter
to your mother.

1282
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:06,849
Your only son is nearly killed,

1283
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,920
and all you can think about
is did I write that letter?

1284
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,026
So did you?

1285
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:14,236
Yeah, I wrote her a letter.

1286
01:07:14,237 --> 01:07:17,688
Did you mail it?

1287
01:07:18,965 --> 01:07:19,621
No. Thought you might like
to read it first.

1288
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:26,558
That's none of my business.

1289
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,940
Dad, I want you to know
how I feel about her.

1290
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:31,184
I want you to know
what it says.

1291
01:07:31,185 --> 01:07:33,979
Why?

1292
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,499
Because we should know that
about each other, shouldn't we?

1293
01:07:37,122 --> 01:07:37,915
Do you still
love her?

1294
01:07:41,781 --> 01:07:45,406
Yes, I do.

1295
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:47,269
Would you take her back?

1296
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,754
No, I wouldn't.

1297
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:51,895
Do you love her?

1298
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,486
She hasn't earned that.

1299
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:58,902
Would you give her a chance to?

1300
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:08,117
Yeah, I would.

1301
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:09,119
Well, good.

1302
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:15,228
We both know
how we feel about your mom now.

1303
01:08:15,229 --> 01:08:16,851
Put a stamp on that envelope,
seal it shut and mail it.

1304
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:20,441
Yes, sir.

1305
01:08:22,512 --> 01:08:23,202
I'll get you another ice pack.

1306
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:31,693
[Alarm sounds]

1307
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:34,282
Doctor, we've got a problem.

1308
01:08:37,975 --> 01:08:39,045
Bed 4's coding.

1309
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:42,669
We need the crash cart
and a defibrilator now.

1310
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,499
Find Doug.
Keep him in the waiting room.

1311
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,743
I'm seeing cardiac arrest.

1312
01:08:48,572 --> 01:08:51,091
I got nothing.

1313
01:08:51,092 --> 01:08:53,093
Start cpr.

1314
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:54,301
[Tad]: Anna, it's tad.
Can you hear me?

1315
01:08:54,302 --> 01:08:57,581
Anna?

1316
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,101
Mom.

1317
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:04,140
She not responding.

1318
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:20,810
Anna, I want you
to listen to me.

1319
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:23,399
The rocks that have been falling
over the last few hours,

1320
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,849
we now know that they're debris
from a single larger meteor

1321
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:27,334
heading our way.

1322
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,267
Your way or mine?

1323
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:30,613
The computer models put impact
in eastern routt county,

1324
01:09:30,614 --> 01:09:35,135
just north of highway 40.

1325
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:36,378
In other words, mine.

1326
01:09:36,379 --> 01:09:38,380
What's going to happen?

1327
01:09:38,381 --> 01:09:40,036
As it hits the atmosphere,

1328
01:09:40,037 --> 01:09:42,418
you're going to hear
a tremendous Sonic boom,

1329
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:44,076
louder than any you've heard
so far.

1330
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,492
The sky above you
will turn blindingly bright.

1331
01:09:46,493 --> 01:09:49,081
And then?

1332
01:09:50,324 --> 01:09:52,808
Listen,
I'm not gonna kid you, Anna,

1333
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:54,430
if it hits, it's like
an atomic bomb going off,

1334
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:56,433
total devastation
at impact site,

1335
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:59,366
with significant damage
up to 500 miles away.

1336
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:01,024
What do you mean "if it hits?"

1337
01:10:02,336 --> 01:10:04,509
It's theoretically
possible

1338
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,648
that a big rock like this
could blow apart

1339
01:10:05,649 --> 01:10:07,754
from all the friction it causes

1340
01:10:07,755 --> 01:10:09,825
as it goes through
the atmosphere...

1341
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:10,929
If the composition
is just right.

1342
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,069
Has that ever happened?

1343
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:14,417
Once, or at least
we think so.

1344
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,763
In 1908, a big meteorite
about this size

1345
01:10:16,764 --> 01:10:21,112
was coming in over Siberia.

1346
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:22,286
Seconds before
it should've hit the ground,

1347
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:23,632
it just blew apart in the sky.

1348
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:26,117
[Anna]: How much time is there?

1349
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:29,052
Projected impact
is in 45 minutes.

1350
01:10:30,398 --> 01:10:32,089
You know we have
no road out of here, tad.

1351
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,507
I've contacted general Wade
at northcom.

1352
01:10:36,508 --> 01:10:38,026
I put in a request for

1353
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,132
as many choppers
as they can spare.

1354
01:10:40,133 --> 01:10:42,685
A request?

1355
01:10:42,686 --> 01:10:43,411
There are 1900 people
in cottonwood, Anna.

1356
01:10:44,895 --> 01:10:46,862
There are tens of thousands more
in towns all across the rockies.

1357
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:49,692
There just aren't
enough helicopters.

1358
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:51,176
And there's
not enough time.

1359
01:10:51,177 --> 01:10:53,627
I'm sorry.

1360
01:10:53,628 --> 01:10:54,319
Do you believe in prayer, tad?

1361
01:10:57,701 --> 01:11:00,220
I believe in science.

1362
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:02,567
But sometimes I hedge my bets.

1363
01:11:02,568 --> 01:11:04,639
Well, hedge one for US,
will you?

1364
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:21,448
[Douglas sobbing]

1365
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,830
I'm so sorry.

1366
01:11:23,831 --> 01:11:27,386
We did everything
we could, but...

1367
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:30,872
Would you like me
to take you in?

1368
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:10,498
Anna...

1369
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:17,366
There's another one coming.

1370
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:22,060
Bigger than all the others.

1371
01:12:22,061 --> 01:12:25,720
If it gets through,
no one will survive.

1372
01:12:28,482 --> 01:12:30,656
I can't do this
anymore.

1373
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:33,901
I can't fix it.

1374
01:12:36,662 --> 01:12:40,907
I can't help the people
of this town.

1375
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:44,359
I...

1376
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,809
I can't even reassure them.

1377
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,364
That's
what I thought

1378
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,537
until you led me
back here.

1379
01:12:50,538 --> 01:12:52,159
I'll have no regrets
about today,

1380
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,092
because I know
I did everything that I could.

1381
01:12:54,093 --> 01:12:56,717
And that's because of you.

1382
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:04,689
There are certain things

1383
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:05,484
that can't be put in a box
and made all better.

1384
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:08,624
Ricky's one of them.

1385
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:12,179
Now Miriam is.

1386
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,319
And what might happen
in that sky tonight is another.

1387
01:13:15,252 --> 01:13:16,392
For the last six months you've
been turning away from me.

1388
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:24,434
Away from Emily.

1389
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,056
Away from everybody else
in this town.

1390
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:39,000
You have 45 minutes, Anna.

1391
01:13:40,519 --> 01:13:44,109
What are you going to do
with them?

1392
01:14:01,367 --> 01:14:05,681
We can break in
in a moment, Anna.

1393
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:06,890
I'll give you a cue.

1394
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:43,099
Okay, Anna,
you're on the air.

1395
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,628
This is mayor Anna Davenport.

1396
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:58,494
I've just spoken to

1397
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:00,805
the Colorado center
for emergency response.

1398
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:06,052
The latest report from NASA

1399
01:15:06,053 --> 01:15:09,365
shows a large meteor headed for
possible impact with earth.

1400
01:15:09,366 --> 01:15:11,679
There is some hope that it
will explode in the
atmosphere.

1401
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,063
But if it doesn't,

1402
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,134
tracking has it making
landfall

1403
01:15:19,135 --> 01:15:21,826
somewhere between

1404
01:15:21,827 --> 01:15:23,276
the eastern rockies
and western Colorado.

1405
01:15:23,277 --> 01:15:27,176
The center of that radius is
right here in cottonwood.

1406
01:15:27,177 --> 01:15:30,077
The estimated time of impact
is in 35 minutes.

1407
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:36,497
As your mayor, it is my duty
to give you this
information,

1408
01:15:38,257 --> 01:15:43,054
but there is no time
or means to flee.

1409
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:47,334
There is only time to
reflect

1410
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:49,820
on how you want to spend
this next half hour.

1411
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:52,030
Some of you may want
to spend it alone,

1412
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:56,482
others with your family.

1413
01:15:58,484 --> 01:16:02,040
I want to spend it
with my husband,

1414
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:06,146
and my daughter,

1415
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,010
and the rest of my family...
The people of this town.

1416
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:13,153
I'm going now

1417
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:14,983
to the cottonwood
community church.

1418
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:17,192
I hope those of you
who want to

1419
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:19,885
will join me there.

1420
01:16:37,454 --> 01:16:41,803
I have to stay.

1421
01:16:41,804 --> 01:16:44,358
I know.

1422
01:16:48,189 --> 01:16:51,848
Anna...

1423
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:55,611
Do you remember
when Ricky was four,

1424
01:16:58,924 --> 01:17:01,408
and he learned
how to snap his fingers?

1425
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:02,169
He was so proud of himself.

1426
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:06,104
And he didn't just snap them,

1427
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,244
he flicked his wrist
like he was throwing dice.

1428
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:11,660
He made up a game about it.

1429
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:15,802
"Mad mommy," he called it.

1430
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:19,012
I would have to pretend
to be mad at him.

1431
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:20,704
"Ricky, you'd better clean
up those toys right now..."

1432
01:17:20,705 --> 01:17:22,638
Then he'd snap his fingers
and I'd have to be nice.

1433
01:17:30,266 --> 01:17:34,579
Thank you for Ricky.

1434
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,997
And thank you for Emily.

1435
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:53,253
Emily, I'm really sorry
about this morning.

1436
01:17:53,254 --> 01:17:56,394
It's okay, mom.

1437
01:17:56,395 --> 01:17:58,811
I just wanted
so much to stay.

1438
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:03,022
To hold on
to this place.

1439
01:18:03,023 --> 01:18:06,266
To Ricky.

1440
01:18:06,267 --> 01:18:09,373
And to Seth.

1441
01:18:09,374 --> 01:18:11,479
You really like him,
don't you?

1442
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:13,791
Yeah. I do.

1443
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:16,105
I should have
listened to you more.

1444
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:17,900
I should have
talked to you more.

1445
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:28,841
What's going
to happen tonight?

1446
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:31,776
We're going
to be together.

1447
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:55,246
Marty, what's wrong?
What's happening?

1448
01:18:55,247 --> 01:18:57,697
Schriever air force base
is sending a chopper.

1449
01:18:57,698 --> 01:18:58,492
It's on its way
here now.

1450
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:00,735
One chopper?

1451
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,530
How many does it hold?

1452
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:04,325
It's an h-60.
The pilot plus 10.

1453
01:19:04,326 --> 01:19:07,707
10?

1454
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:09,123
You're telling me
we can only save 10 people?

1455
01:19:10,435 --> 01:19:13,264
If it helps,
I took a head count.

1456
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:15,232
How many children?

1457
01:19:15,233 --> 01:19:16,233
18 and under?
Yes.

1458
01:19:16,234 --> 01:19:17,337
More than 10.

1459
01:19:17,338 --> 01:19:18,339
There you go.

1460
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:21,341
[Anna]: 16 and under.

1461
01:19:21,342 --> 01:19:22,584
It's too many.
I'm not going.

1462
01:19:22,585 --> 01:19:24,241
Marty, 16 and under?
How many?

1463
01:19:24,242 --> 01:19:26,657
13, Anna.

1464
01:19:26,658 --> 01:19:28,348
Mom, I said
I'm not going.

1465
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:29,488
You are going to
get on that helicopter.

1466
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:33,665
Somehow, you are going
to get on that helicopter.

1467
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:35,494
There isn't enough room.

1468
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:37,427
Emily, I want you
to survive.

1469
01:19:37,428 --> 01:19:39,498
Mom, it's okay.

1470
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,500
I'm not afraid.

1471
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:45,021
It's okay, mom.

1472
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:56,515
How far is schriever
from here?

1473
01:19:57,068 --> 01:19:59,414
50 miles.

1474
01:19:59,415 --> 01:20:01,830
It'll be here.

1475
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:03,383
Just keep
watching the sky.

1476
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:06,697
[Tad]: Anna?

1477
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:07,561
Tad, what's happening?

1478
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:13,704
General Wade issued a calldown
of all his craft.

1479
01:20:13,705 --> 01:20:16,880
They're needed
in the regions

1480
01:20:16,881 --> 01:20:17,984
where more people live.

1481
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:19,504
More people?

1482
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:21,264
Or more important people?

1483
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:23,196
I'm sorry, Anna.

1484
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:25,682
I'm so sorry.

1485
01:20:35,692 --> 01:20:40,282
It's okay, Tyler.
I'm right here.

1486
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:41,836
You're in the hospital, Tyler.

1487
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,321
And Jack is taking care of you.

1488
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:46,288
You've got a tube in your mouth,
so you can't talk now, Tyler,

1489
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:49,084
but you're going
to be just fine.

1490
01:20:49,085 --> 01:20:51,604
Tyler, I've been here
the whole time.

1491
01:20:51,605 --> 01:20:52,778
And I'm not
going anywhere.

1492
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:54,608
I'm not going
to leave your side.

1493
01:20:58,267 --> 01:21:02,891
You should go.

1494
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:04,100
Go be with your family.
I'll cover here.

1495
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:33,611
What should we do now?

1496
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:36,476
Where should we go?

1497
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:38,237
I think our odds of surviving
are better if we split up.

1498
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:41,619
If we all huddle here
and the church gets hit,

1499
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:44,519
who's going to make it
out of here alive?

1500
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,245
If we fan out
as far as we can,

1501
01:21:46,246 --> 01:21:47,109
we'll have a better
chance of survival.

1502
01:21:50,595 --> 01:21:54,116
[Jack]:
Do you really want to survive

1503
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,118
if the people you love don't?

1504
01:21:57,015 --> 01:21:57,913
I know I wouldn't.

1505
01:22:01,537 --> 01:22:05,403
Neither would I.

1506
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:26,216
And I do believe,

1507
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:27,045
if we stand together,
these moments will have meaning.

1508
01:22:27,528 --> 01:22:31,118
Emily.

1509
01:22:32,775 --> 01:22:33,500
Too bad Ricky's not around
to snap his fingers, huh?

1510
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:39,989
Maybe he is, baby.
Maybe he is.

1511

Good morning, folks,

1526
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:13,771
dj Dan here again.

1527
01:24:13,772 --> 01:24:15,566
I have
another confession to make.

1528
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:18,431
I fired my vedic
astrologer.

1529
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:19,123
She tried to tell me not to
vote in today's election

1530
01:24:20,124 --> 01:24:24,023
for our new mayor.

1531
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:26,232
She said I should embrace
whatever fate comes

1532
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,614
and live my life
in sync with the stars.

1533
01:24:28,615 --> 01:24:32,411
I say she's a nut.

1534
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:35,069
I'm voting.

1535
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,208
Because I'm a free-willed man,
and I make my own fate.

1536
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:39,833
And so should you.

1537
01:24:45,563 --> 01:24:49,911
Are you hungry?

1538
01:24:49,912 --> 01:24:51,223
Yeah.

1539
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:51,983
Can I get you anything else?

1540
01:24:55,297 --> 01:24:56,436
No, I'm great.
Thanks.

1541
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:09,414
[Knocking]

1542
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:29,124
If this threesome's
at my doorstep,

1543
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:32,160
there must be trouble.

1544
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:32,817
We don't have any troubles,
do we, Millie?

1545
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:37,510
The three of US are
getting along just fine.

1546
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:39,340
Then why are you here?

1547
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:41,963
Well, Anna,
it's customary

1548
01:25:41,964 --> 01:25:43,896
for the losing
candidate

1549
01:25:43,897 --> 01:25:45,622
to call the winner
and offer congratulations,

1550
01:25:45,623 --> 01:25:48,280
but under
the current circumstances,

1551
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:50,247
we thought a face-to-face visit
was in order.

1552
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:52,353
So, who's conceding to whom?

1553
01:25:52,354 --> 01:25:55,356
We are.

1554
01:25:55,357 --> 01:25:56,323
To you.

1555
01:25:56,324 --> 01:25:57,979
To me?

1556
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,946
Marty won 2% of the vote
on a write-in.

1557
01:25:58,947 --> 01:26:01,156
Millie won 12%.

1558
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,606
And I won 26%.

1559
01:26:04,607 --> 01:26:05,746
The other 60% voted for you.

1560
01:26:06,609 --> 01:26:10,165
Great job!

1561
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,304
Congratulations, Anna.

1562
01:26:12,305 --> 01:26:13,615
You did it.

1563
01:26:13,616 --> 01:26:15,134
What's going on out here?

1564
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:16,411
Your mother
just got re-elected.

1565
01:26:16,412 --> 01:26:17,619
She did?

1566
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:18,449
Well, what do you say?

1567
01:26:21,452 --> 01:26:24,938
Are we moving
to Chicago?

1568
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:32,946
[Anna]: You want to help me
take down that sign?

1569
01:26:37,122 --> 01:26:41,264
Okay...
On three.

1570
01:26:41,265 --> 01:26:43,231
Okay.

1571
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:44,233
One, two, three!
