1
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,304
( indistinct chatter )
 GOOD EVENING, MA'AM.

2
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:41,368
( elevator bell dings )
 ( indistinct chatter )

3
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,337
HEY, JIMMY RAY, WHAT'S UP,
MAN? YOU GOT SOME SMOKES?

4
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,872
YEAH, I GOT SOME SMOKES.

5
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,574
YOU GOT THE LAUNDRY TRUCK
SET UP FOR ME?

6
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,975
AROUND BACK.

7
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,747
I GOT DANKER RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

8
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,382
NO, ATLANTA.

9
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,883
DID YOU SEE THAT GUY
IN THE CAR, MAN?

10
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,252
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
FOLLOW ME.

11
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,620
YEAH, SURE.

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,489
YOU GOT IT.

13
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,631
( coughs )
 HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

14
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,639
YOU GOT A WARRANT?

15
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,241
I'M TELLIN' YOU GUYS.

16
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,245
I'LL CUT YOU, MAN!

17
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,013
YOU SON OF A--
 YOU'RE PICKING ON

18
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,783
THE WRONG GUY.

19
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,385
FBI.

20
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,692
WE'RE COOL. WE'RE COOL.

21
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:44,664
( chuckles )
 ( wind whistling )

22
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,967
STUPID SONS OF BITCHES.

23
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,503
( muttering )
 AHH!

24
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,315
OHH!

25
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:05,852
UHH!

26
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,940
YOU SURE THIS'LL WORK?

27
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,842
I TOLD YOU, THEY DESIGNED
THIS NEW SYSTEM FOR QUICK

28
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,046
ACCESS, IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES.

29
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:10,350
I CUT THIS ALARM,
AND WE ARE HOME FREE.

30
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,018
( beep )
 HOW'D IT GO?

31
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,118
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

32
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,053
HEY.

33
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,389
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

34
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,890
YOU'RE A GENIUS, BOB.

35
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,395
IT WAS SO SIMPLE. WE JUST--
 GET IN THE VAN.

36
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,796
DAMN! WE DID IT!

37
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,431
WE REALLY DID IT!

38
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,000
MARCY, I LOVE YOU.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,603
I FEEL SO LUCKY--
 ENOUGH OF THAT.

40
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,738
I SAID ENOUGH.

41
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:05,839
HEY.  JIMMY.

42
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,408
WHAT? YOU NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
KISS YOUR SISTER BEFORE?

43
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,976
I SAID ENOUGH OF THAT.

44
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,545
WHAT? WHAT?

45
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,414
DID YOU FUCK THIS GUY?

46
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,815
DON'T.

47
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,450
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

48
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,818
JIMMY, DON'T.

49
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,854
JIMMY? I THOUGHT
HIS NAME WAS BOB.

50
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,422
ANSWER ME, GODDAMNIT!

51
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,424
DID YOU FUCK HIM?!

52
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,659
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

53
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,428
I MADE HIM FALL IN LOVE
WITH ME.

54
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,931
WHAT?!

55
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,067
YOU'RE NOT MARCY'S BROTHER?

56
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,802
NO.

57
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,570
STOP IT.

58
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,873
NO!!!

59
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,008
AND HER NAME IS NOT MARCY.

60
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,043
STOP IT!

61
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,578
UHH! UHH!

62
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,548
STOP IT! JUST STOP IT!

63
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,817
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

64
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,688
I TOLD YOU I'D KILL ANYONE
THAT TOUCHED YOU!

65
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,457
( "Marcy" whimpering )
 STUPID...

66
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,696
( gears grind )
 I'M SORRY, HONEY.

67
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,521
I REALLY AM.

68
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,189
I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

69
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:09,162
I CAN'T STAND TO THINK OF
THAT PUNK TOUCHING YOU.

70
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,765
DON'T TURN AWAY FROM ME, HONEY.

71
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,300
PLEASE.

72
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,903
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

73
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,806
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

74
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,809
DON'T EVER, EVER LEAVE ME.

75
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,711
PLEASE.

76
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,680
PLEASE...PLEASE DON'T.

77
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,183
STOP IT.

78
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,819
MAKE LOVE TO ME.

79
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,722
OH!

80
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,862
SAY "JIMMY RAY."

81
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,598
SAY "JIMMY RAY."

82
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,599
SAY "JIMMY RAY."

83
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,366
JIMMY RAY.

84
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,701
SAY, "JIMMY RAY, I LOVE YOU."

85
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,037
JIMMY RAY, I LOVE YOU.

86
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:28,241
I LOVE YOU TOO, BABY.

87
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,210
YOU WON'T EVER LEAVE ME.

88
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,145
I LOVE YOU.

89
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,849
FBI Agent: I WENT TO ATLANTA
TO NAIL HIM. I KNEW HE WAS

90
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,817
GOING THERE ON A JOB.

91
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,987
YOU WERE DOWN THERE
ON VACATION.

92
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,991
YOU REPRESENTED YOURSELF IN
AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY.

93
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,159
UNOFFICIALLY.

94
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,394
THAT'S THE WRONG ANSWER.

95
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,063
I READ YOUR REPORT.

96
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,132
IT'S LUNACY. NEXT?

97
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,400
AW, COME ON, JACK.

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,902
THE BASTARD'S RICH NOW.

99
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,038
HE'S TURNED THIS STOLEN MONEY
INTO REAL ESTATE; HE'S SO LEGIT

100
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,773
HE EVEN PAYS TAXES!

101
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,742
SO? THE MAN'S A PATRIOT.

102
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,777
HE MIGHT NOT PULL
ANOTHER JOB!

103
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,714
I'VE WAITED 15 MONTHS FOR
ATLANTA. IF I DON'T SMOKE HIM

104
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,883
OUT NOW, I MAY NEVER GET HIM.

105
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,185
YOU'RE TAKING THIS
VERY PERSONALLY.

106
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,053
WHAT'S YOUR OBSESSION 
WITH THIS GUY?

107
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,656
ENLIGHTEN ME.

108
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,091
HE'S BEATEN ME TWICE.

109
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,127
HE'S PLAYING WITH ME NOW.

110
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,397
AND I CAN'T PROVE SHIT.

111
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,901
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE
WHO'S OBSESSED?

112
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,136
( both laugh )
 OPEN THE DOOR! STEP THROUGH!

113
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,087
EVEN WITH THE AUTHORIZED
RELEASE FROM THE COURTS,

114
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,790
THIS HAS TO BE STRICTLY
VOLUNTARY ON THE PART

115
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,925
OF THE PRISONER.

116
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:56,396
GEE, YOU THINK HE'LL CHOOSE
TO STAY HERE?

117
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,463
COME ON, MAN.

118
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,732
MAKE THAT GOODBYE MOVE.

119
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,768
IT'S OVER.

120
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,404
( chatter, laughter )
 CHECK.

121
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,343
All: OH, YEAH!

122
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,179
( enthused chatter )
  WILL YOU DUMB SCHOOLGIRLS

123
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,785
SHUT UP?

124
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,853
( chatter stops )
 YOU LEFT YOUR QUEEN

125
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,233
UNPROTECTED.

126
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:39,872
( laughter )
 ( chatter )

127
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:48,381
THAT AIN'T NO WAY
TO TREAT A LADY.

128
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,283
CHECK.

129
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,055
SCOLD HIM! SCOLD HIM!

130
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,026
YOU KNOW, HISTORICALLY,
ALL THE GREAT MILITARY CAMPAIGNS

131
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,162
WERE WON ON PAPER BEFORE
A SHOT WAS EVER FIRED.

132
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,033
NOW, TAKE ROBERT E. LEE,
A MASTER STRATEGIST.

133
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,967
WHO GIVES A SHIT?

134
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,002
YOU IN CHECK, MAN.

135
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,870
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

136
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,872
( laughter )
 JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU

137
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,774
AN EDUCATION, BIGGS.

138
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,810
NOW, FOR HIS VICTORY AT
FREDERICKSBURG, HE HAD

139
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,414
ANTICIPATED HIS OPPONENT'S
EVERY MOVE, SO WAS ABLE TO APPLY

140
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,284
THE APPROPRIATE COUNTERMOVE.

141
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,220
SUCH AS...

142
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,389
CHECKMATE.

143
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:35,228
( chatter, laughter )
 THE KING IS DEAD!

144
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,397
LONG LIVE THE KING!

145
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,932
WHOO-HOO!

146
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,203
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

147
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,406
GRUDGE MATCH, SIR.

148
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,475
( all shouting )
 COOL IT, ASSHOLE!

149
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,480
HE STARTED IT!

150
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,481
COME ON!

151
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,282
I'M ALL RIGHT.

152
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,351
HE DIDN'T HURT ME.

153
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,953
( shouting )
 THAT'S YOUR MAN. COOPER.

154
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,348
AHHH.

155
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,916
YOUR HIGHNESS.

156
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,952
OR WOULD YOU PREFER
YOUR MAJESTY?

157
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,621
ACTUALLY, WE PREFER
"YOUR ROYAL MAJESTY."

158
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,956
PLEASE, BE SEATED.

159
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,257
HA HA HA HA!

160
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,260
A MAN AFTER MY HEART,
A REGULAR WISE-ASS.

161
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,397
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M SO
HAPPY TO BE HERE.

162
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,867
IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A HOTHEAD
YOU'D BE OUT OF HERE BY NOW.

163
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,204
IF I WERE DOING TWELVE-TO-TWENTY
FOR ARMED ROBBERY, I WOULDN'T

164
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,473
BE PUNCHING GUARDS AROUND.

165
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:57,543
I'D SAY YOU'RE GONNA DIE
IN THIS LOVELY LITTLE ROOM.

166
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,979
WELL, I'LL TELL YA,
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,

167
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,250
WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR
I COULD BE OUT IN THIRTY YEARS.

168
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,285
WELL, I'M YOUR FAIRY
GODMOTHER.

169
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:12,558
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
TOO LOUD IN HERE.

170
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,527
THE WARDEN TOLD YOU MY PLAN?

171
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,131
YEAH. YOU WANT ME TO FLY
TO DENVER TO SET UP JIMMY RAY

172
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,433
IN EXCHANGE FOR PAROLE.

173
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,535
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
SCREW IT UP.

174
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,071
YOU'RE THE CLOSEST THING TO
A FRIEND OF JIMMY RAY'S

175
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,939
I COULD FIND.

176
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,177
YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE CROSSING
AN OLD CELLMATE?

177
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,913
JIMMY RAY IS A PSYCHOPATH.

178
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,181
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE IN HERE.

179
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,949
WHY?

180
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,251
WAIT A MINUTE.

181
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,653
IF SOME GUY WANTS TO TAKE
THE HIGH HARD ONE UP THE

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:44,056
KEISTER, THAT'S FINE WITH ME
SO LONG AS IT'S HIS IDEA.

183
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,192
BUT FIVE-ON-ONE WAS NOT HIS
IDEA; THEY WERE GONNA RAPE HIM

184
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,193
OR KILL HIM.

185
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,661
YOU'RE A MORAL CRUSADER?

186
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,166
NO. NO, I AM WHAT IS KNOWN
AS A FUCKING IDIOT.

187
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,568
BECAUSE A WEEK LATER, THE
LAUNDRY ROOM SOMEHOW CAUGHT

188
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,671
ON FIRE AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE
GOT BURNED. MAYBE IF I HADN'T--

189
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,508
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

190
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,481
HERE'S THE SET-UP.

191
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,618
IF YOU CROSS ME AND RUN, I WILL
DEVOTE MY LIFE TO FINDING YOU

192
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,122
AND BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF.

193
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,623
I'M NOT GONNA RUN, OSCAR.

194
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,359
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

195
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,705
IS THIS KIND OF A PERSONAL
THING WITH YOU AND JIMMY RAY?

196
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,173
JUST DOIN' MY JOB.

197
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,509
UH-HUH. WELL, YOU'RE THE
EXPERT HERE, BUT YOU THINK HE

198
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,412
MIGHT BE SUSPICIOUS WHEN I GREET
HIM WEARING HANDCUFFS?

199
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,682
FUNNY. NOW, THERE'S AN EXTRA
LITTLE WRINKLE HERE.

200
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,219
JIMMY RAY HAS GOT A GIRLFRIEND,
A FORMER DANCER, REAL PRETTY.

201
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,353
MONEY'LL BUY THAT.

202
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,287
NOW LISTEN TO ME.

203
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,288
SHE'S UNBALANCED.

204
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,257
SHE HAD ONE OF THOSE
NIGHTMARE CHILDHOODS.

205
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,526
SHE'S DANGEROUS,
YOU'RE VULNERABLE.

206
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,995
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE
TO GET JIMMY RAY--

207
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,530
JUST CONCENTRATE ON HIM.

208
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,532
YOU FOLLOW?

209
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,151
ONE MORE.

210
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,191
YA FUCKIN' PRICK.

211
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,492
YOU DIRTY DOG.

212
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,428
PUT 'EM ON DOWN, JIMMY.

213
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:46,045
( approving chatter )
 HEY, TAKE IT SLOW, MAN.

214
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,813
YEAH! JIMMY RAY!

215
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,224
OH, YEAH! JIMMY RAY!

216
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,294
MY MAN JIMMY! WHOO!

217
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,366
GO, J.R.

218
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,505
JIMMY RAY!

219
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:16,576
YOU AIN'T STUPID ENOUGH 
TO BE HUSTLING ME, ARE YA?

220
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,312
WHOO.

221
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,214
YOU CALLIN' ME A HUSTLER?

222
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,217
YOU CALLIN' ME A HUSTLER?

223
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,419
THAT'S RIGHT, ASS-WIPE.

224
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,620
HE AIN'T A HUSTLER.

225
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,422
YOU JUST STINK.

226
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,490
AND WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

227
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,626
I'M THE BILLIARDS POLICE.

228
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,395
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS THE WORST
STICKMEN THAT WILL CALL SOMEONE

229
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,563
A HUSTLER.

230
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,099
I'LL PUT THIS STICK
UP YOUR ASS, MARY JANE.

231
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,635
NO SHIT?  HEY, TINY.

232
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,503
OHH!

233
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,739
UHH!

234
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,779
HEY, DOUG, GIMME THAT BEER.

235
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,453
( choking )
 T.C. TEDDY COOPER.

236
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,691
JIMMY RAY.

237
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,126
SON OF A BITCH, HUH?

238
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,561
WHAT ARE YOU  DOING HERE?

239
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,796
AH, I WAS CRUISING AROUND,
STOPPED IN DENVER, THOUGHT

240
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,131
I'D SEE PIKE'S PEAK.

241
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,132
YOU KNOW.

242
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,734
PIKE'S PEAK?

243
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,369
HOW COME THEY LET YOU OUT?

244
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,537
I LET THE WARDEN BLOW ME.

245
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,640
( both laugh )
 WELL, I CAN'T SAY I MISSED

246
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,308
YOU, BUT IT SURE IS
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

247
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,309
WHERE YOU STAYIN'?

248
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,345
I'M NOT REALLY STAYING
ANYWHERE.

249
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,747
WELL, YOU ARE NOW.

250
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:32,151
GONNA TAKE ME HOME ON
MY NEW HARLEY.

251
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,187
I OWN ALL THE LAND
GOING UP TO THE CREEK.

252
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,825
AND ANOTHER 60 ACRES OF WOODS
OVER THERE.

253
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,328
THERE SHE IS.

254
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,573
HOME SWEET HOME.

255
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,475
IMPRESSIVE, HUH?

256
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,712
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID
EATING DIRT FOR BREAKFAST

257
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:03,649
I ALWAYS KNEW I'D ONE DAY
OWN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

258
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:09,288
MY PHILOSOPHY: YOU SEE SOMETHING
YOU WANT, TAKE IT. SIMPLE.

259
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,424
HA HA HA HA!

260
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,226
JULIA!

261
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,730
JULIA!

262
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,498
JULIA?

263
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,466
MR. DANKER.

264
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,902
YOU'RE BACK EARLY.

265
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,704
BEN, UH, MEET T.C.

266
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,739
AN OLD BUDDY OF MINE THAT'S
GONNA BE STAYING WITH US

267
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,673
FOR A FEW DAYS.

268
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:28,574
HOW DO YOU DO.

269
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,842
HOW YA DOIN', BEN?

270
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,877
PUT HIM UP IN THE GUEST
HOUSE, TAKE HIS THINGS.

271
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,381
AND, UH, CAN YOU  PUT OUT
A JACKET AND SHIRT FOR ME?

272
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,882
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK INTO TOWN.

273
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,983
YES, SIR.  WHERE'S JULIA?

274
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,586
ON HER WAY DOWN, SIR.

275
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:46,625
NOW YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE WHY
I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE.

276
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,728
JULIA.

277
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,665
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU ABOUT T.C.?

278
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,877
HELLO.

279
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:09,381
JULIA SOMERS,
LOVE OF MY LIFE...

280
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:16,288
MEET TEDDY COOPER, THE MAN
WHO SAVED MY LIFE.

281
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,391
NOW... WHY DON'T YOU
CUT THE BULLSHIT

282
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,728
AND TELL ME WHY YOU'RE HERE.

283
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,897
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

284
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:30,669
PIKE'S PEAK MY GRANDMA'S ASS.

285
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,941
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT
THIS WHEN WE'RE ALONE, OKAY?

286
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,613
NO. JULIA, SHE'S MY
RIGHT EYE, SHE'S MY LEFT ARM,

287
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,516
SHE'S MY HEART AND SOUL.

288
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,019
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT
IN FRONT OF HER.

289
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,290
YOU STILL WORKIN', JIM?

290
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,025
UH...

291
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,963
NO, I'VE RETIRED NOW.

292
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,367
BUT YOU CAN TRY AND TEMPT ME.

293
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:08,974
HOW'S HALF A MILLION
IN DIAMONDS SOUND?

294
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,843
DIAMONDS.

295
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,816
WHERE DO I COME IN?

296
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,451
WHY? YOU'RE RETIRED, MAN.

297
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:25,791
WELL, MAYBE I'LL MAKE
A COMEBACK.

298
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:30,729
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M JUST
MAKING THIS ALL UP, J.R.

299
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,798
Julia: CAN WE CHANGE
THE SUBJECT?

300
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,536
SHH. NOW, DARLIN',
NOT WHEN I'M TALKIN' BUSINESS.

301
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,971
COME ON.

302
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,708
WE'RE NOT TALKING BUSINESS.

303
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,010
ARE WE?

304
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,745
YOU GOT ANYTHING DECENT
TO WEAR?

305
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,648
I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
BEING INDECENT.

306
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,084
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU 
TO A CHARITY EVENT

307
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,519
I'M HOSTING TONIGHT.

308
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,621
YOU'LL BE VERY IMPRESSED.

309
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,823
YOU KNOW, I BEEN THINKIN'...

310
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,493
THE WARDEN WASN'T EXACTLY 
YOUR TYPE, SO HOW THE HELL

311
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,362
DID YOU GET OUT OF THERE?

312
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,464
DON'T LIE TO ME.

313
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,869
JIMMY RAY,
I RATTED PEOPLE OUT.

314
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,839
THERE WAS GONNA BE A PRISON
BREAK, I WAS THE WARDEN'S MAN.

315
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,876
NOW, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT I'M OUT.

316
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,578
HA HA HA HA!

317
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,146
WELL, I'M PROUD OF YOU.

318
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,881
DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

319
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,751
LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GO
INTO TOWN TODAY.

320
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,721
SO YOU HANG AROUND THE HOUSE,
USE THE POOL, USE THE SAUNA,

321
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,089
USE ANYTHING YOU WANT...

322
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:33,826
EXCEPT JULIA.

323
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:36,695
THIS IS YOURS FOR AS LONG
AS YOU WANT TO STAY.

324
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:54,880
LITTLE ISOLATED, BUT I GUESS
IT BEATS THE SLAMMER, EH?

325
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,416
( knocks ) HI.

326
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,018
HI.

327
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,487
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
FOR A RIDE?

328
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,556
ARE YOU ANY GOOD ON A HORSE?

329
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,859
YEAH, I CAN USUALLY
AVOID FALLING OFF.

330
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,727
GOOD.

331
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,896
PUT YOU ON LIGHTNING.

332
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,131
LIGHTNING?

333
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,699
WHOA! WHOA!

334
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,868
YAHHH!

335
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,437
WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

336
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,044
Julia: COME ON, PEPPER.

337
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,454
OH, SHIT!

338
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,856
WHOA! OOHHH!

339
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,458
OHH...

340
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,994
OH, GOD. YOU OKAY?

341
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,729
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

342
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,564
I USUALLY DON'T FALL
OFF HORSES... BECAUSE

343
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,566
I DON'T USUALLY GET ON 'EM.

344
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,735
( both laugh )
 CATHERINE, COOL 'EM OUT,

345
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,009
OKAY?

346
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,578
YES, MISS SOMERS.

347
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,886
YOU'RE THE GIRL FROM
THE Z.Z. TOP VIDEO

348
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,722
DANCING ON THE BEACH, RIGHT?

349
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:15,227
OH, MY GOSH. ( laughs )
YEAH.

350
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,062
THAT WAS ME.

351
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,099
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

352
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,502
WHY? DON'T YOU LIKE DANCING?

353
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,905
NO. NOT REALLY.

354
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,241
IF YOU'RE THE LEAST BIT
ATTRACTIVE EVERYONE THINKS

355
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,043
THAT YOU'RE REALLY STUPID.

356
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:35,013
IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A SERIOUS
DANCER, A BALLERINA OR ANYTHING,

357
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,683
I JUST WANTED TO GET
AWAY FROM HOME.

358
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,818
TRAVELED ALL OVER.

359
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,088
I'VE BEEN TO EUROPE AND
NEW YORK, L.A.

360
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:49,628
I EVEN DID A COMMERCIAL--
ONCE. HA HA!

361
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,663
HALF THE TIME I WAS SO
SCREWED UP ON DRUGS I DIDN'T

362
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,832
EVEN KNOW WHERE I WAS.

363
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:59,705
I USED TO WAKE UP AND NOT KNOW
HOW I GOT THERE.

364
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:02,307
I WAS HIGH FOR YEARS.

365
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,546
THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER NOW,
THOUGH.

366
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,616
WHAT, YOU MEAN SINCE
YOU MET JIMMY RAY?

367
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,551
OH, YEAH.

368
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,953
HE SAVED ME.

369
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,290
EVEN THOUGH HE BEATS YOU?

370
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,325
LOOK, I KNOW JIMMY RAY,
AND I CAN SEE THE BRUISE,

371
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,994
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

372
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,229
HE IS EXCITABLE, THAT'S ALL.

373
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,100
HE CARES ABOUT ME TOO MUCH.

374
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,843
DO YOU BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION?

375
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,114
I'LL BET YOU DO.

376
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,649
YEAH.

377
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:49,154
I THINK THAT WE COME BACK HERE
MANY TIMES TO LEARN SOMETHING.

378
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,058
WE TRY TO FIND OUR SOUL MATE.

379
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,597
THEY SAY THAT WHEN YOU SEE
YOUR SOUL MATE...

380
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,835
THAT YOU KNOW HIM RIGHT AWAY...

381
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:11,009
THAT THE MOMENT YOU SEE HIM,
YOU JUST...YOU JUST KNOW.

382
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,980
( sighs )
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY JUST HERE

383
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,749
TO STEAL SOME DIAMONDS.

384
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:26,291
( rock music plays )
 HEY, I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT

385
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,939
J.R. STANDS FOR "JIMMY RAY."

386
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,109
HELL, I'D NEVER HAVE NOTICED.

387
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,945
MISS SOMERS, YOU'RE LOOKIN'
LOVELY TONIGHT.

388
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:50,082
JIMMY RAY, GOOD TO SEE YA.

389
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,885
RIGHT OVER HERE.

390
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,921
( rock music continues )
 IT WOULD APPEAR YOU'RE PRETTY

391
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:08,433
POPULAR AROUND HERE, JIMMY RAY.

392
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,737
I'M JUST AN OLD-FASHIONED
AMERICAN CAPITALIST.

393
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,173
I STOLE MONEY,
AND I INVESTED IT.

394
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,675
NOW I'M RESPECTABLE.

395
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,145
I ALWAYS DREAMED OF OWNING
A CLUB LIKE THIS, T.C.

396
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,948
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT FEELS
TO HAVE ALL YOUR DREAMS

397
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,683
COME TRUE.

398
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,985
THAT RIGHT, SWEETHEART?

399
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,055
DANCE WITH ME, JIMMY.

400
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,423
WITH A PROFESSIONAL?

401
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:35,227
NO, THANK YOU.

402
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,728
TEDDY.

403
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,463
YOU WANNA DANCE WITH ME?

404
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,966
( Teddy chuckles )
YOU KNOW HOW SOME GUYS

405
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,267
HAVE TWO LEFT FEET?

406
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,869
I GOT THREE.

407
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:48,106
HE'S BRAGGING. REMEMBER,
I SAW HIM IN THE SHOWER.

408
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,342
HA HA HA!

409
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,345
COME ON, A NAME.

410
00:26:55,714 --> 00:27:00,385
MEDNIKOW JEWELERS,
BERNEL JEWELERS.

411
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,854
OH, YEAH?

412
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,259
MENDIKOW'S?

413
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:12,130
BERNEL. YOU COULDA GOT
THOSE NAMES STRAIGHT OUT OF

414
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,067
THE TELEPHONE BOOK.

415
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,802
YEAH, BUT WHO SUPPLIES 'EM?

416
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,006
JIMMY, YOU SAID AFTER THE
LAST TIME WE'D QUIT FOREVER.

417
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,408
ANGEL, YOU JUST LISTEN
TO THE MUSIC.

418
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:27,479
T.C., ARE WE PLAYING
TWENTY QUESTIONS HERE?

419
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,048
I WANT A NAME.

420
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,050
I WON'T RIP YOU OFF.

421
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,153
THIS IS YOUR GIG,
I RESPECT THAT.

422
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,523
WE'LL GO, UH,
WE'LL GO FIFTY-FIFTY.

423
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:44,429
IF WE CAN'T TRUST EACH OTHER,
WHO CAN?

424
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,368
CRAWSON'S. KANSAS CITY.

425
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,304
WELL?

426
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:56,041
WELL, IT'S A NAME.

427
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,044
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

428
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,413
Man: JIMMY RAY?

429
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,083
I'M BEING SUMMONED.

430
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,286
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.

431
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,922
DARLIN', YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

432
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,493
DOESN'T SHE LOOK BEAUTIFUL?

433
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,560
( laughs )
 Emcee: HELLO.

434
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:26,304

UH, HELLO. GOOD EVENING!

HE LOVES YOU.

438
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,149
HE SAID HE'D KILL ME IF
I EVER TRIED TO LEAVE.

439
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,484
HE MEANT IT.

440
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,054
Emcee: ...LEADING CITIZENS,

00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:12,417

00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,176
BASTARD.

00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,479

00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,817
HEY, TAKE IT EASY, JIM,
COME ON.

493
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,187
JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

494
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,324
THIS IS BULLSHIT.

495
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,327
WHAT IN THE FUCK DID I DO
TO DESERVE THIS?

496
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,595
JIMMY--
 HEY. ( laughs sheepishly )

497
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,347
WAS THAT JUST YOU BACK THERE?

498
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,384
I'D FORGOTTEN HOW GOOD YOU WERE.

499
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,354
I APPRECIATE IT.

500
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,358
THANKS.

501
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,494
I GUESS THAT'S ANOTHER ONE
I OWE YOU.

502
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,864
THEN DO THIS JOB WITH ME,
JIMMY BOY. COME ON.

503
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,234
WELL, I BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

504
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:27,172
I'VE GOTTA GO TO BOULDER
TOMORROW ON BUSINESS.

505
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,209
I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D GO OVER
TO KANSAS CITY AND CHECK

506
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,312
THE PLACE OUT, IF IT'S 
ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

507
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,348
IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

508
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,783
NO, IT'S JUST THE WAY I WORK.

509
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,253
IF I LIKE IT, I'LL DO IT.

510
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:46,424
THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE THING.

511
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,397
DO YOU FIND JULIA ATTRACTIVE?

512
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,165
AND...

513
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:58,436
ARE YOU THINKING OF DOING HER,
MAYBE, WHILE I'M AWAY?

514
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,138
HMM?

515
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,206
YEAH, I FIND HER ATTRACTIVE.

516
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,375
WHO WOULDN'T?

517
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,478
BUT I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
SLEEPING WITH MY FRIEND'S

518
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:09,481
OLD LADY.

519
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,688
IT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

520
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:20,392
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD DENIED IT,
THEN I'D HAVE KNOWN YOU

521
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,894
WERE SCHEMING ON HER.

522
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,599
I'M SORRY, MAN.

523
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,769
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE
WITH A WOMAN? I MEAN,

524
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:36,274
SO IT'S DRIVING YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

525
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,376
NO.

526
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:47,786
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU,
YOU'RE LUCKY.

527
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,555
I TELL YOU, IT'S HELL ON EARTH.

528
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,661
NOW, YOU KNOW I'VE DONE SOME
BAD THINGS IN MY TIME, T.C.

529
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,597
(sarcastic) NO.

530
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,833
BUT I SWEAR...

531
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:06,371
I THOUGHT GOD HAD FORGIVEN ME
THE DAY HE SENT ME JULIA.

532
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:13,611
SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN I'VE EVER
FELT I COULD SETTLE DOWN WITH.

533
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,714
SEE, ALL THIS...

534
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,951
WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT HER.

535
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,354
I DO EVERYTHING FOR HER NOW.

536
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,624
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE GOT
TO PROTECT HER.

537
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,328
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE GETS
A LITTLE CRAZY HERSELF

538
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,865
SOMETIMES.

539
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,404
WHEN...

540
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:42,474
WHEN SHE TOUCHES ME...

541
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,710
HER SKIN...

542
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,581
HER HAIR, HER HANDS...

543
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,450
SHE READS MY HAND SOMETIMES.

544
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,654
AND YOU KNOW, I COULD SIT
AND JUST WATCH HER HANDS

545
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,524
ALL DAY.

546
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:09,734
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
TO YOU...IS THAT I...

547
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:14,405
I VALUE OUR FRIENDSHIP,
I REALLY DO.

548
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,009
BUT IF YOU TOUCH HER...

549
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,822
THANKS FOR LISTENING TO ME.

550
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,724
GET SOME REST.

551
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:51,543
I'LL BE OUT OF HERE
WHEN YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING.

552
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,013
Oscar: ACT LIKE YOU'RE
TAKING A PISS.

553
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,615
( Teddy sighs )
 ANOTHER NIGHT ON THE TOWN

554
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,456
WITH JULIA AND JIMMY RAY.

555
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:08,927
JIMMY RAY IS
A FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

556
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,862
BUT DOES HE LIKE DIAMONDS?

557
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,097
TOMORROW HE'S GOING TO
KANSAS CITY TO CHECK ON

558
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,966
CRAWSON'S.

559
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,670
PERFECT. OUR MAN THERE
WILL TELL HIM ALL

560
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,806
HE NEEDS TO KNOW--
ACCIDENTLY.

561
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,709
OSCAR, THOSE ROCKS
BETTER BE REAL.

562
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,344
JIMMY RAY KNOWS HIS DIAMONDS.

563
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,447
I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT IN THE
HEAD WHEN HE OPENS THAT SACK.

564
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,883
UNLESS THEY'RE REAL,
I CAN'T BUST HIM.

565
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,919
WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND OUT
TODAY? LIKE ON THE HORSE TRAIL,

566
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,355
FOR INSTANCE.

567
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,924
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE WATCHING ME, OSCAR?

568
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,896
( chuckles )
SHE'S GETTING TO YOU

569
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,631
ALREADY, HUH?

570
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,032
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

571
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,434
JULIA.

572
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,969
SHE'S A BLACK WIDOW SPIDER, MAN.

573
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,005
YOU GET CAUGHT IN HER WEB,
SHE'LL EAT YOU UP.

574
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,907
HOW POETIC.

575
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,742
HAVE I PISSED ENOUGH?

576
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,145
DON'T LET YOUR PECKER
FUCK THIS UP.

577
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,981
I'M WARNING YOU.

578
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,516
I'VE PISSED ENOUGH.

579
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:10,922
YOU KNOW, OSCAR, I DON'T SEE
WHAT'S SO CRAZY ABOUT JULIA.

580
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:15,960
YOU MEAN EXCEPT FOR ONE
LITTLE MINOR DETAIL--

581
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,397
SHE LIVES WITH JIMMY RAY.

582
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,060
YEAH?

583
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,629
CAN I COME IN?

584
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,097
YES.

585
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,867
HI.

586
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,736
HI.

587
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,839
BEN SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANY BREAKFAST, BUT ROSA MADE

588
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,042
FRESH STRAWBERRY PIE.

589
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,577
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME.

590
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,447
THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.

591
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,554
YOU WANTED TO KISS ME
YESTERDAY.

592
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,823
I DID.

593
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,595
YES, YOU DID.

594
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,865
I DID.

595
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,868
I WISH THAT YOU HAD.

596
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,038
YOU'RE WITH JIMMY RAY.

597
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,108
( coughs ) I'M JUST A...

598
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,046
IF YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME
AS ME, THEN JUST TELL ME NOW

599
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,882
AND I'LL FORGET IT.

600
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,686
YOU BETTER GO.

601
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,755
ARE YOU SURE?

602
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,685
WAIT. WAIT. WHAT--
THIS IS NUTS. WHAT AM I DOING?

603
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,687
WHY AM I DOING THIS?

604
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:23,988
THIS IS CRAZY!

605
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,656
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

606
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,692
BECAUSE THIS FEELS RIGHT.

607
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:36,968
THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO FEEL.

608
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,103
OH, TEDDY...

609
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,839
I KNEW YOU'D COME.

610
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,550
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE.

611
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,986
UHH! UHH!

612
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,823
NO.

613
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,992
LOOK AT ME.

614
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,227
LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME.

615
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,664
NOT LIKE THIS.

616
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,833
JUST FEEL ME.

617
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,768
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

618
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,904
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

619
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,274
JUST...JUST FEEL ME.

620
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,283
OH, GOD.

621
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,155
JULIA...

622
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:18,429
SOMETIMES YOU MAKE ME
FEEL CRAZY.

623
00:43:18,429 --> 00:44:36,807
IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

624
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,876
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE
NOURISHMENT IS PROBABLY NOT

625
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,113
A BAD IDEA.

626
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,185
( sighs ) MY GOD.

627
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,353
( starts car )
 IT WAS STUPIDITY, REALLY.

628
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:57,461
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID
MY OLD MAN DIED, AND SOMETIMES

629
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,197
I THINK HE DIED JUST TO
GET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER.

630
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,501
BUT ANYWAY, WE WERE POOR,
I WAS ALWAYS BROKE, WORKING

631
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:06,904
MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL,
AND I WAS JUST SICK OF

632
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,440
EVERYTHING.

633
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,476
SO I GOT AHOLD OF THESE GUYS
FROM THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,

634
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,078
AND THEY HAD A PLAN.

635
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,213
AND LIKE AN IDIOT,
I GET DRUNK,

636
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,549
GET A GUN--
IT WASN'T EVEN LOADED--

637
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,819
I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY STUPID.

638
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:28,259
MUST BE HORRIBLE TO BE
LOCKED AWAY LIKE THAT.

639
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:32,363
THE FIRST TWO YEARS,
I DON'T KNOW... BUT I STARTED

640
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,265
TO EDUCATE MYSELF.

641
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,133
I SET GOALS.

642
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,869
THE THIRD YEAR I DECIDED 
I'D READ ALL THE RUSSIANS--

643
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,373
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, OF
COURSE, WAR AND PEACE--

644
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,240
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

645
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,177
I'M BORING YOU, RIGHT?

646
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:49,146
NO.

647
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,348
I DON'T KNOW.

648
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:56,487
THIS IS HAPPENING SO FAST.

649
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,523
YOU COULD REALLY HURT ME.

650
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:03,160
I'LL NEVER HURT YOU, JULIA.

651
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,931
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

652
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,868
I DON'T TRUST PEOPLE.

653
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,971
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

654
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,241
YOU CAN.

655
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,047
YOU CAN.

656
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,253
YOU KNOW, I HAD TOO MUCH
ICE TEA, I THINK.

657
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,455
EXCUSE ME.

658
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,231
YOU STUPID DUMB-ASS
SON OF A BITCH!

659
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,067
OSCAR, YOU GOT THIS GIRL
ALL WRONG, MAN.

660
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,069
I DO? TELL ME.

661
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,505
SHE'S KIND, SHE'S SWEET,
SHE'S THE NICEST GIRL

662
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:50,174
I EVER MET. SHE JUST HAS
A LITTLE SELF-DESTRUCT GOING,

663
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,275
THAT ALL.

664
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,143
AND YOU WANT TO HELP HER.

665
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,078
YEAH, I'M GONNA TRY.

666
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,648
YOU ASSHOLE! YOU'RE BEING
TAKEN IN BY THE MAYA!

667
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,117
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, MAYA?

668
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:00,918
WHAT IS THAT?

669
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,654
THAT'S HINDU-- ILLUSION
IN THE SHAPE OF A WOMAN.

670
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,557
SHE AIN'T WHAT SHE
APPEARS TO BE.

671
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,959
AND WHATEVER SHE'S TELLING YOU,
SHE'S NEVER GONNA LEAVE

672
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,494
JIMMY RAY.

673
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,330
MAYBE I JUST TRUST PEOPLE 
MORE THAN YOU DO, OSCAR.

674
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,132
OH, MAN.

675
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,268
HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED IT OUT?

676
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:21,071
THE WOMAN IS A LIAR.

677
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,345
( runs faucet )
 YOU REALLY LIKE THIS

678
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,591
CRYSTAL, HUH?

679
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,560
I MEAN, I GIVE YOU
A $20 NECKLACE, AND YOU ACT

680
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,528
LIKE IT'S A DIAMOND.

681
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,264
IT'S WHAT IT MEANS.

682
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,102
I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

683
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:01,445
NOT THAT. HA HA!

684
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,214
I ONLY WEAR THIS WHEN I'M ALONE.

685
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,217
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

686
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,220
DON'T LAUGH. I MADE IT
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

687
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,055
PUT OUT YOUR HAND.

688
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,594
OPEN?

689
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,429
YEAH.

690
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:21,599
WOW! IT'S AN INDIAN NECKLACE,
HUH?

691
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,068
YEAH.

692
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:29,073
IT'S KIND OF SILLY.

693
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,709
YOU MADE THAT?

694
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:34,478
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME.

695
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,715
I NEVER WILL.

696
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,058
JULIA?

697
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,427
OH, MY GOD, HE'S BACK.

698
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,129
Jimmy Ray: YOU UPSTAIRS?

699
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,633
JULIA?

700
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,407
YOU'RE BACK.

701
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,142
YEAH.

702
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,048
HEY, YOU'RE WET.

703
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,151
YEAH, I WAS IN THE BATH.

704
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,120
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

705
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,521
OH, UH, IT'S A CRYSTAL.

706
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,290
I BOUGHT IT TODAY.

707
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,724
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MAGIC.

708
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:21,825
UH-HUH.

709
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:22,793
LET'S GO DOWNSTAIRS.

710
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,128
I'LL MAKE YOU A DRINK.

711
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,263
I'VE HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.

712
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,098
COME ON.

713
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,402
YOUR SKIN IS THE ONLY
MAGIC I NEED.

714
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,605
COME ON, LET'S GO.

715
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,748
WHAT'S GOING ON?

716
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,517
COME HERE.

717
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,523
THE WINDOW'S OPEN.

718
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,525
YOU'LL GET YOUR DEATH OF COLD.

719
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,127
( laughs nervously )
 ( door opens )

720
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,633
WAKE UP, BOY.

721
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,603
JIMMY RAY.

722
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,905
WHEN'D YOU GET BACK, MAN?

723
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,474
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

724
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,346
LET'S GET SOME LIGHT ON
IN HERE.

725
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:25,282
NO, COME ON, MY EYES.

726
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,885
WHAT YOU BEEN DOIN'?

727
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:31,455
NOT MUCH. YOU KNOW, UH...

728
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,325
READING, JUMPED IN YOUR POOL.

729
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,633
SPEND MUCH TIME WITH JULIA?

730
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,235
YEAH. WE DROVE INTO TOWN.

731
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,671
SHE BOUGHT A DRESS.

732
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,874
I GOT SOME BOOKS.

733
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,848
SO TALK TO ME.

734
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,786
GOT AN ASHTRAY?

735
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,622
HERE. USE THIS.

736
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:20,904
SO? YOU CHECK OUT MY STORY?

737
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:27,244
IT'S TRUE.

738
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,017
CRAWSON'S TAKE DELIVERY
FROM GALVESTON.

739
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,820
LOOK, MAN, I DON'T GIVE
A FLYING FUCK WHERE

740
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,955
IT COMES FROM.

741
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:38,989
I JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL.

742
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,860
I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY,
I GOT NO HOME--

743
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,562
IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN,
I'M GONNA BE FLIPPIN' BURGERS

744
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,531
FOR FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR.

745
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,668
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, YES OR NO?

746
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,905
I'VE JUST BEEN WONDERING...

747
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,841
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS?

748
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:05,315
( chuckles )
THAT MY SECRET, JIMMY BOY.

749
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,583
HEY, LOOK, I'LL TELL YA.

750
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,819
BIG DEAL. A LIFER GAVE IT TO ME.

751
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,422
PART OF MY END GOES TO
HIS OLD LADY.

752
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,058
BUT LOOK, MAN, IT'S GOING DOWN
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

753
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,630
YOU GOTTA TELL ME YES OR NO.

754
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,865
WELL...

755
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,502
IT'S NOT BECAUSE I NEED
THE MONEY...

756
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:29,973
BUT WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE,
DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S

757
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:31,909
BEST FRIEND.

758
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:39,783
( laughs )
SO...

759
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:43,020
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

760
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,389
RIGHT THERE.

761
00:53:50,460 --> 00:54:00,003
I CAN'T READ THIS
WITHOUT A LIGHT.

762
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,438
( paper rustling )
 I'M IMPRESSED.

763
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:10,948
LOOK AT THAT.

764
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:16,386
YOU GOT YOUR MAP, SCHEDULE,
ALL RIGHT THERE.

765
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,957
YOU ALWAYS WERE
A CLEVER BOY, T.C.

766
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:21,792
THIS IS ONE OF YOUR CHESS GAMES.

767
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:26,930
LET'S HOPE IT MAKES US
SOME MONEY...PARTNER.

768
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,399
( door opens )
 ( Jimmy Ray sighs )

769
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,944
YOU AND T.C. HAVE FUN
IN TOWN TODAY?

770
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:45,515
UH, YEAH, I-I GOT A DRESS,
AND HE WANTED TO GET

771
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,552
SOME BOOKS OR SOMETHING.

772
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,923
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

773
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:56,994
WHAT, ARE YOU INTERROGATING
ME OR SOMETHING? IS THAT IT?

774
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,663
NOW, DON'T LIE TO ME.

775
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,699
DON'T YOU LIE TO ME.

776
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:13,143
DID YOU PULL YOUR LITTLE
PRICK TEASE ACT AGAIN TODAY?

777
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,846
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

778
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:26,056
I WAS NICE TO HIM
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

779
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:29,192
WELL, HE'S LYING TO ME.

780
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,062
LYING?

781
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,997
YEAH.

782
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,501
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

783
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,969
IT'S...

784
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,470
IT'S TOO EASY.

785
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,639
SUDDENLY HE'S FREE.

786
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,942
THEN HE'S GOT A PLAN.

787
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,148
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

788
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,517
TEDDY?

789
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,787
WHERE DO YOU THINK I MET HIM?

790
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,489
AT A COUNTRY CLUB?

791
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,491
HE'S A CON.

792
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:05,796
AND WE'D SAY AND WE'D DO
ANYTHING TO SURVIVE.

793
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:10,500
I KNOW HE'S GOT A HARD-ON
FOR YOU A MILE LONG.

794
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,172
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

795
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:18,575
( chuckles )
IT MEANS HE WANTS

796
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,645
YOUR LITTLE TRIANGLE.

797
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:24,514
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

798
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,922
CAN'T SAY I BLAME HIM.

799
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,928
CAN'T SAY I BLAME HIM AT ALL.

800
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,001
HE'S BEEN INSIDE SO LONG,
YOU KNOW, HONEY, HE'D FUCK

801
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:48,505
A RATTLESNAKE NOW IF HE COULD
FIND SOMEONE TO HOLD ITS MOUTH

802
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,507
OPEN LONG ENOUGH.

803
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,843
YOU'RE DISGUSTING,
YOU KNOW THAT?

804
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,845
( chuckles )
HA HA HA!

805
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:08,258
NOW, GIRL, I WANT YOU, TOMORROW,
TO FIND OUT WHAT HE'S UP TO.

806
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,527
I WANT YOU TO TALK TO HIM.

807
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:14,965
MY VIBRATION'S TELLING ME
THAT HE'S LYING.

808
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:18,001
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU,
HONEY?

809
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,669
DID YOU HURT YOUR BACK?

810
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,638
YEAH, RIDING PEPPER TODAY.

811
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,242
I PULLED SOMETHING.

812
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:28,612
HEY, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

813
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:34,317
I'LL BE GENTLE WITH YOU.

814
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,036
HEY.

815
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:55,772
WHEW. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

816
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,041
DOESN'T SHE LOOK BEAUTIFUL?

817
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,309
YEAH.

818
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,578
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

819
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,146
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
TO VISIT A TAX LAWYER

820
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,981
THIS AFTERNOON.

821
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,584
SO JULIA, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ENTERTAIN OUR BOY HERE

822
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:14,024
ALL ALONE ON HIS LAST DAY
BEFORE HE LEAVES US.

823
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,892
SHOW HIM A GOOD TIME.

824
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,694
OKAY?

825
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,097
OKAY?

826
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,698
OKAY.

827
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,134
OKAY.

828
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,744
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

829
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,784
( Jimmy's car starts )
 HOW CONVENIENT FOR HIM

830
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,225
TO LEAVE US ALONE.

831
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,695
YOU'RE LEAVING TOMORROW.

832
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,897
WHERE?

833
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,900
TORONTO.

834
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,636
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME.

835
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,304
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

836
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,673
HOW? WHAT ARE WE DOING?

837
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,744
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT'S 
GOING ON HERE.

838
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,347
JULIA, YOU'RE LEAVING THAT
MANIAC AND COMING AWAY

839
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:11,948
WITH ME TOMORROW.

840
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,217
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?

841
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,086
I REALLY WISH THAT I COULD
BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE

842
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,955
TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

843
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:21,691
ABOUT WHAT?

844
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,927
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

845
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,996
OKAY, TOMORROW I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU A MAP OF WHERE

846
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,965
WE'RE GONNA MEET. OKAY?

847
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,101
NOW, YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TRUST ME, JULIA, YOU KNOW--

848
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,302
NO, NO, I DON'T.

849
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,237
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

850
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,207
IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I NEED
TO KNOW, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

851
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:40,177
I'M SO CONFUSED. I--
DON'T! DON'T!

852
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,379
DON'T.

853
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,117
I LOVE YOU, JULIA.

854
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:59,996
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

855
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:08,939
OH...

856
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,273
COME ON.

857
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,409
COME ON.

858
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,946
( car drives away )
 ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT

859
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:23,920
ANOTHER DRINK?

860
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,223
OH YEAH.

861
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,291
OKAY.

862
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,795
MISS, COULD I GET ANOTHER
MARGARITA, PLEASE?

863
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:32,996
No tequila.

864
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:36,166
SURE.

865
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,235
WHAT DID YOU JUST
SAY TO HER?

866
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:41,771
NOTHING, I ORDERED
ANOTHER DRINK.

867
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,174
DO YOU THINK SHE'S CUTE?

868
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,875
WH-WHAT?

869
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,345
WELL, YOU WERE LOOKING
AT HER ASS SO MUCH, I THOUGHT

870
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:51,881
MAYBE THAT YOU LIKED HER ASS.

871
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:58,288
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, JULIA?

872
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:01,825
I WANT TO MAKE LOVE
WITH YOU...NOW.

873
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:05,261
LET'S GET A MOTEL OR SOMETHING.

874
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,530
I'LL GET THE CHECK.

875
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,035
Waitress: MAY I TAKE 
YOUR ORDER?

876
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,937
CAN I GET THE BILL, PLEASE?

877
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:15,272
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

878
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,809
THERE'S TWENTY, OKAY?

879
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,344
NOW, YOU COME BACK.

880
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,147
YEAH, RIGHT.

881
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,826
COME ON, BABE, WAIT UP!

882
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,964
JULIA, COME ON! THE GIRL
WOULDN'T LET GO OFF MY HAND--

883
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,098
DON'T TOUCH ME.

884
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,900
YOU THINK I'M GONNA JUST
STAND THERE AND LET YOU

885
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,201
MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME?

886
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,503
WHAT'S GOING ON? COME ON.

887
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:48,138
YOU'RE LIKE EVERY OTHER MAN.

888
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,106
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT!

889
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,142
JULIA, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

890
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,977
YOU WANT TO HIT ON THAT
LITTLE TRAMP IN FRONT OF ME,

891
01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,945
THAT'S FINE! I DON'T CARE!

892
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,013
JULIA, THIS IS CRAZY!

893
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:57,914
THIS IS NUTS!

894
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,482
DON'T CALL ME NUTS!

895
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,985
GODDAMNIT, THE GIRL GRABBED
MY HAND, SHE WOULDN'T LET GO!

896
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,053
THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED!

897
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,388
YES, AND YOU ACTED LIKE
THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!

898
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,523
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME, HUH?

899
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,058
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!

900
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,826
THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!

901
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:13,496
HOW COULD YOU CALL ME THAT,
HUH? WHAT ABOUT JIMMY RAY, HUH?

902
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,099
DON'T HIT ME, OKAY?

903
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:18,268
JULIA, I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU.

904
01:02:18,268 --> 01:02:19,936
I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU.

905
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,105
I LOVE YOU. I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON

906
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,440
IN YOUR MIND.

907
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,607
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

908
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:25,875
YOU GOT IT?

909
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,177
YOU LEAVE ME...

910
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:30,080
YOU LEAVE ME ALONE.

911
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:34,484
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. JULIA!

912
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,987
HAPPY NOW?

913
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,990
LIE DOWN WITH DOGS
AND GET UP WITH FLEAS.

914
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,459
NOT NOW, OSCAR.

915
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,593
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT CLICHE?

916
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,495
I GOT OTHERS.

917
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,330
ARE YOU GONNA BLOW THIS THING 
OVER SOMETHING YOU DON'T

918
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,466
UNDERSTAND? I WARNED YOU.

919
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:52,302
AND NOW YOU'RE MESSING
WITH MY LIFE.

920
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:55,305
OSCAR, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

921
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:59,209
THERE'S A REAL DARKNESS
IN YOU, ISN'T THERE?

922
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,411
YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE DARK.

923
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:06,182
I WARNED YOU, BUT HERE YOU ARE--
A BRAINLESS BUG FLYING HAPPILY

924
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,219
INTO THE WEB, BECAUSE YOU...

925
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:13,189
LIKE IT ON THE DARK SIDE!

926
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:20,196
YOU ARE CRAZY, OSCAR,
YOU KNOW THAT? YOU ARE SICK.

927
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:24,334
IF TOMORROW GOES RIGHT,
YOU'RE FREE.

928
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:29,639
BUT IF YOU FUCK THIS UP
OVER HER...

929
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,477
I WON'T PUT YOU BACK IN JAIL.

930
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,480
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

931
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,282
JULIA TOLD ME YOU WERE
COMING ON TO HER!

932
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:14,150
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?

933
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,118
OHH!

934
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,319
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

935
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,521
I KNEW YOU WERE LYING TO ME!

936
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:23,393
HA HA HA! BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
IT COULD BE ABOUT JULIA.

937
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,561
AHHH!

938
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,196
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

939
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,464
WOMEN BEATERS SCARE ME.

940
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:34,137
GIRLFRIEND GETS A LITTLE
CONFUSED SOMETIMES, HUH?

941
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,672
FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

942
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:38,975
FUCKING ASSHOLE.

943
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:42,111
( chuckles )
SHE'S MINE!

944
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:45,014
UNDERSTAND? MINE!

945
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,586
REMEMBER THAT, BOY.

946
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:52,422
JUST REMEMBER THAT. MINE!

947
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:27,223
( laughs )
SEE YA IN THE MORNIN'.

948
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,692
( door opens )
 JULIA, WHAT--

949
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:33,763
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

950
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,133
TEDDY, JUST HOLD ME, PLEASE.

951
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,207
DO YOU HATE ME? I COULDN'T
LIVE IF YOU HATED ME.

952
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,743
I DON'T HATE YOU,
BUT THIS CANNOT BE SAFE.

953
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:48,444
DON'T MAKE ME GO.

954
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,781
HE'S ASLEEP. PLEASE, I KNOW
THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

955
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,351
JIMMY TOLD ME THAT YOU JUST
WANTED TO FUCK ME.

956
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:58,054
JULIA, THAT SON OF A BITCH
HAD A GUN TO MY HEAD

957
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,490
AT THE TIME. COME ON.

958
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:03,326
OH, MY GOD.

959
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:06,329
OH, GOD, I COULD HAVE LOST YOU.

960
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,531
(crying) I'M SORRY.

961
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:11,367
IT'S OKAY.

962
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:12,802
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?

963
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,704
YEAH, I FORGIVE YOU. YEAH.

964
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,506
YOU DO?

965
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,508
OH, BABE.

966
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:20,576
COME HERE.

967
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,446
YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY WHO
LOVED YOU AND CARED FOR YOU

968
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,081
THE WAY I DO, BABY.

969
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:25,815
YEAH.

970
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,483
BUT I DO.

971
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,786
I REALLY DO.

972
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,455
IT'S SUCH A STRANGE THING
THAT'S GOING ON.

973
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:35,591
A WEEK AGO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE ALIVE, AND NOW I DON'T

974
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:39,195
THINK I COULD EVER LIVE
WITHOUT YOU.

975
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:42,532
LET'S JUST RUN AWAY FROM
HERE, LET'S JUST GO.

976
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,534
HE'S ASLEEP, LET'S JUST
GO RIGHT NOW.

977
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,135
I CAN'T.

978
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,571
WHY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
THROUGH WITH THIS ROBBERY.

979
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:49,505
YES, I HAVE TO.

980
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,274
WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

981
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,443
SHH! SHH! QUIET!

982
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:55,812
LISTEN TO ME. YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I HAVE TO DO THIS?

983
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:58,348
BECAUSE THE FBI GOT ME
OUT OF JAIL!

984
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,217
THIS WHOLE ROBBERY
IS A SET-UP!

985
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,887
HE'S GONNA GET BUSTED TOMORROW.

986
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:07,490
THE FBI WILL WANT ME, TOO.

987
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,691
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

988
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,259
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

989
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:11,561
I DID A REALLY BAD THING.

990
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:19,335
DON'T WORRY. YOU AND I
ARE GONNA DISAPPEAR, BABY.

991
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:23,506
IS IT OSCAR?

992
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,442
HOW DO YOU KNOW OSCAR?

993
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:29,846
HE'S BEEN AFTER JIMMY RAY
SINCE I MET HIM.

994
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,382
RIGHT. LISTEN,
IT DOESN'T MATTER. NOW, THIS

995
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,884
IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN....

996
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:02,612
WHERE WERE YOU?

997
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:06,349
WITH TEDDY.

998
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:09,352
AND?

999
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:13,489
AND I FOUND OUT
WHAT YOU WANTED.

1000
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:17,794
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS,
JIMMY.

1001
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:20,263
HE'S WORKING FOR THE FBI.

1002
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:24,467
THEY'RE GONNA COME
ARREST US TOMORROW.

1003
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,502
GOD IN HEAVEN.

1004
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,772
I KNEW HE WAS LYING TO ME.

1005
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,407
YOU PROMISE ME, JIMMY.

1006
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,242
YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

1007
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,245
YOU GOTTA KEEP ME SAFE.

1008
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,918
OH, I'M GONNA GO THROUGH 
WITH IT ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

1009
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:44,520
I'M GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT.

1010
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,590
JIMMY, IT'S THE FBI.

1011
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:51,260
YOU THINK I'M SCARED
OF THEM?

1012
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:56,799
( laughs )
WELL DONE.

1013
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,668
GOOD WORK.

1014
01:08:58,668 --> 01:09:00,803
GOOD WORK.

1015
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:04,507
GOOD WORK.

1016
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:09,679
Jimmy Ray (distant):
YOU FUCKING TOLD ME, MAN.

1017
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,347
YOU FUCKIN' LIED TO ME!

1018
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,550
YOU DID! KANSAS CITY!

1019
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,721
IT'S NOT GOING DOWN THE WAY
I TOLD YOU IT WAS. FORGET IT!

1020
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,924
JULIA TOLD ME. YEAH.

1021
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,560
T.C. IS WORKING FOR THE FBI.

1022
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,430
( Jimmy continues, indistinct )
 ( door slams in distance )

1023
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:45,581
( gasps )
OH, GOD, TEDDY.

1024
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,316
YOU'RE EARLY, MAN.

1025
01:09:47,316 --> 01:10:07,003
( chuckles )
LET'S GO.

1026
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:08,371
WHICH DOOR IS IT?

1027
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,907
THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

1028
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,543
LOCK UP ALL EXITS.

1029
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,678
THEY'RE ON THE ROOF.

1030
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,017
Teddy: RIGHT ON TIME.

1031
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,902
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO?

1032
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,037
YEAH.

1033
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,540
SAM. CAN YOU SEE THEM?

1034
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,042
THEY MOVED BEHIND THE TRUCK.

1035
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,043
COME ON, BOYS!

1036
01:10:47,043 --> 01:10:49,345
WAIT A MINUTE. THIS ISN'T
THE WAY OSCAR HAD IT PLANNED.

1037
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:50,846
SHUT UP! DIAMONDS IN THE BOX?

1038
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:51,681
YEAH.

1039
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,115
EVERYBODY MOVE IN NOW!

1040
01:10:53,115 --> 01:11:12,068
HANDS THROUGH THE MIRROR
BRACKET. HANDCUFF 'EM.

1041
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,136
( starts, revs motorcycle )
 GET OSCAR. NOW!

1042
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,542
WE GOT JIMMY RAY,
BUT COOPER IS GONE.

1043
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:20,876
AND SO ARE THE DIAMONDS.

1044
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:24,880
SHIT!

1045
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,083
GODDAMNIT!

1046
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,907
OHH!

1047
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,716
THAT'S IT!

1048
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,453
SUSPENSION, PENDING
INVESTIGATION.

1049
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:07,556
YOU NEVER LISTEN, OSCAR.

1050
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,993
WE TRACED COOPER TO TORONTO,
FENCING SOME OF THE DIAMONDS.

1051
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,762
HE'S IN CHINATOWN.

1052
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:18,634
I'LL GET THE SON OF A BITCH,
AND THE DIAMONDS BACK.

1053
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,770
( sighs )
 ( chuckles )

1054
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,691

JULIA SOMERS,
MEET OSCAR PIERCE.

1062
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:23,726
YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK OF HIM.

1063
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:27,596
MISS SOMERS.

1064
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:31,200
I'VE ENJOYED YOUR SHAMPOO
COMMERCIAL.

1065
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,736
HA HA HA HA!

1066
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,608
WELL, OSCAR,
I'D POUR YOU A DRINK...

1067
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,745
ONLY I DON'T WANT TO.

1068
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,282
NOW, YOU...

1069
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:49,351
AND YOUR F-B-FUCKIN'-I
DECIDED I COULD NOT

1070
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:50,820
BE PROSECUTED.

1071
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,689
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1072
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:58,160
AH...I NEED YOUR HELP.

1073
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,797
COOPER'S BEEN TRACED SELLING OFF
SOME OF THE DIAMONDS.

1074
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,301
HELP ME GET THEM BACK AND I WILL
FORGET I EVER HEARD OF YOU,

1075
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:13,042
AND YOU CAN SETTLE THINGS WITH
COOPER ANY WAY YOU WANT.

1076
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:18,647
( laughs)
( continues laughing )

1077
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,883
ANY WAY I WANT?

1078
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:25,754
OSCAR...

1079
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,691
JUST HOW STUPID DO YOU
THINK I AM?

1080
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,392
LOOK!

1081
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,028
ASS-WIPE...

1082
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,966
GETTING THOSE DIAMONDS BACK
IS THE TICKET TO MY LIFE.

1083
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,269
NOW, I COULD KILL COOPER TODAY,
BUT IT WON'T GUARANTEE

1084
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,137
GETTING THOSE DIAMONDS BACK.

1085
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:46,075
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE LURED
INTO GIVING THEM OVER.

1086
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:59,221
AND YOU...HAVE THE ONLY
THING HE WANTS.

1087
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,689
NO.

1088
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,359
NO, JIMMY, I WON'T DO THAT.

1089
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,896
(laughs) YOU SEE, OSCAR?

1090
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:09,265
YOU SEE...

1091
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:12,701
HOW THIS LITTLE EPISODE
WITH TEDDY COOPER HAS INTERFERED

1092
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:16,872
WITH MY OTHERWISE PERFECT
RELATIONSHIP WITH MS. SOMERS?

1093
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:27,249
NOW, DARLING, OSCAR'S OFFERING
TO FINALLY LEAVE ME ALONE.

1094
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,918
AND I'M GONNA GET T.C.

1095
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:33,155
IF IT'S THE LAST THING
I DO ON EARTH.

1096
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:37,126
SO YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

1097
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:42,131
YOU EITHER COME TO YOUR SENSES
AND YOU HELP ME, OR YOU GET

1098
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,133
THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

1099
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:47,937
TODAY. ALONE.

1100
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,407
NO MONEY. NO CLOTHES.

1101
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:52,908
ALONE.

1102
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:56,378
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ALONE.

1103
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,781
NOW...

1104
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,887
...WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

1105
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,823
JULIA?

1106
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,425
JULIA.

1107
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:11,427
JULIA.

1108
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:02,344
Teddy: I ONLY RECENTLY
STARTED THINKING ABOUT THESE

1109
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:07,216
THINGS, THE DARKNESS, MAKING
AN EFFORT TO MOVE TOWARDS

1110
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:09,218
THE LIGHT.

1111
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:13,222
I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR
CONVERSATIONS, BUT I HAVEN'T

1112
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:16,558
BEEN COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

1113
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:22,998
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
AFRAID TO TELL YOU.

1114
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:25,367
I STOLE SOMETHING...

1115
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,537
VERY VALUABLE.

1116
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:34,109
BUT I DECIDED I WANT TO RETURN
IT SO I CAN STAY WITH YOU

1117
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:39,014
AND LEARN WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

1118
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,984
YOU ARE MAKING PROGRESS.

1119
01:18:41,984 --> 01:18:48,857
YOU ARE ALREADY TEACHING
YOURSELF.

1120
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:51,126
TAKE THIS BOOK.

1121
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:54,129
IT WILL HELP YOU.

1122
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,143
BY THE WAY, DID I MENTION
THAT I COMMUNICATED WITH MEMBERS

1123
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,312
OF THE POLICE UP HERE?

1124
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,548
IT SEEMS THEY'RE EXTREMELY
UNDERPAID, SO IT TOOK A BIT

1125
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:17,152
OF MY SAVINGS.

1126
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:19,855
BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
MOTHERFUCKER, BEFORE I GET

1127
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:23,992
THOSE DIAMONDS, YOU TWO
WILL BE FOUND LYING FACE DOWN

1128
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:26,862
IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY.

1129
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:31,934
IT WOULD PAIN ME
TO SEE THAT HAPPEN.

1130
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,570
( car horn honks )
 HE'S BACK.

1131
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:49,051
OKAY, TELL ME AGAIN.

1132
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:51,553
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1133
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:58,193
JUST GET THE DIAMONDS.

1134
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,596
UNDERSTAND?

1135
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,333
THEN HE'S A DEAD MAN.

1136
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:07,269
GO AHEAD AND GET DRESSED.

1137
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,136
( Oscar chuckling )
 ( footsteps )

1138
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,206
TEDDY?

1139
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:54,109
IT'S JULIA.

1140
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:58,313
TEDDY, PLEASE LET ME IN.

1141
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:17,199
HOW DID YOU FIND ME HERE, 
JULIA? HOW DID YOU FIND ME?!

1142
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:22,104
JIMMY RAY, THROUGH 
THE DENVER POLICE.

1143
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,338
FUCKIN' NIGHTMARE.

1144
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:24,373
I'M SORRY.

1145
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:26,041
I'M JUST GONNA GO.

1146
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,176
JULIA, YOU ARE MY
WORST FUCKIN' NIGHTMARE.

1147
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,213
DON'T EVEN TRY TO LIE TO ME,
JULIA. YOU TOLD JIMMY RAY

1148
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:34,283
EVERYTHING. I HEARD YOU.

1149
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:37,553
GIVE ME THIS.

1150
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:40,489
DON'T! 
AAH!

1151
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:43,592
YOU FUCKING LIAR!

1152
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,494
OSCAR WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

1153
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:48,096
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF
FUCKING DEMON!

1154
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:51,166
DON'T CALL ME THAT!

1155
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:52,434
LISTEN TO ME.

1156
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,103
LISTEN TO ME!!!

1157
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:56,772
TEDDY, I LOVE YOU.

1158
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,807
TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT, JULIA.

1159
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,643
TELL ME HOW YOU DO IT, HUH?!

1160
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,546
I LOVED YOU, AND YOU TRIED
TO KILL ME!

1161
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,248
NO, I DIDN'T.

1162
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:07,582
NO, I DIDN'T.

1163
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:08,717
YOU DID.

1164
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:09,751
I WAS SCARED.

1165
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:10,819
I WAS AFRAID.

1166
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,721
I DIDN'T WANT THE ROBBERY TO
HAPPEN, I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T

1167
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:13,755
WANT THE ROBBERY TO HAPPEN!

1168
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:16,224
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE 
GOING TO ABANDON ME, TEDDY!

1169
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,694
PLEASE, I SWEAR TO GOD,
I LOVE YOU!

1170
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,562
OH, SAVE YOUR LIES!

1171
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,697
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

1172
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:22,631
LISTEN TO ME.

1173
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:23,565
ALL RIGHT, I'M LISTENING!

1174
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,767
TALK TO ME! SAY IT!

1175
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:26,802
HOW DO YOU DO IT?!

1176
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:27,869
I DON'T KNOW.

1177
01:23:27,869 --> 01:23:29,671
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.

1178
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,608
I'M SORRY. EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY
DAY I THINK ABOUT YOU, AND I

1179
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:35,277
WAKE UP AND I THINK THAT WE
SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER AND

1180
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:36,812
THEN I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

1181
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:39,748
OH, TEDDY--TEDDY, I'M--
I FEEL LIKE--

1182
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:48,890
( gasping )
I FEEL LIKE I'VE COMMITTED

1183
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,160
MURDER.

1184
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,798
YOU TRIED.

1185
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:02,637
I--I FEEL LIKE
I MURDERED MYSELF.

1186
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,340
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!

1187
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,344
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING 
BUT YOU.

1188
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:15,651
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE, EVERY MOMENT,
EVERY MINUTE, EVERY BREATH.

1189
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,653
TEDDY, YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE OF ME.

1190
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:20,655
IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

1191
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:25,427
AND IF I CAN'T BE WITH YOU,
THEN I WANT TO BE DEAD.

1192
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:28,463
WELL, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

1193
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:30,265
PAIR OF EIGHTS.

1194
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,904
PAIR OF NINES.

1195
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,373
( laughing )
 WELL, UH, HE HASN'T

1196
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,311
THROWN HER OUT, SO IT MUST
BE WORKING.

1197
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,446
I GUESS.

1198
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,914
I GOTTA HIT THE CAN.

1199
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:49,184
DO I TRUST YOU,
OR DO I HANDCUFF YOU?

1200
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,820
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D HANDCUFF ME.

1201
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,589
AHH. HA HA HA!

1202
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:02,597
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GETTING TO BE FRIENDS.

1203
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,767
SORRY, OSCAR,
I WANT THE DIAMONDS TOO.

1204
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,636
( gunshots )
 ( shouting in distance )

1205
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,271
NO BLOOD.

1206
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:50,612
SEE THAT?

1207
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:53,281
$490,000 IN DIAMONDS.

1208
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,683
AND I'M JUST LEAVING IT.

1209
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:55,917
WE SHOULD--WE SHOULD GO.

1210
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,552
I'M LEAVING 'EM HERE, JULIA.

1211
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,455
'CAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
JIMMY RAY'S FOLLOWING YOU,

1212
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:01,723
RIGHT?  WE SHOULD GO.

1213
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,291
IS THAT IT? GOTTA GO.

1214
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,927
LET'S GO. LET'S JUST GO
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

1215
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,529
( gunshot )
 AAHH! OHH!

1216
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,808
GOOD WORK, BABE.

1217
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:26,348
( crying )
 YOU SET ME UP AGAIN. HA HA!

1218
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,618
GET OFF HIM, JULIA.

1219
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,021
GET OFF HIM!

1220
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,056
NO! NO!!!

1221
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,960
NO! OHHH!

1222
01:26:41,463 --> 01:26:42,998
YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

1223
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:45,000
I CAN'T FORGIVE BETRAYAL.

1224
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,469
GO TO HELL, JIMMY RAY.

1225
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:51,606
( laughs )
I DON'T BELIEVE IN HELL.

1226
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:52,941
( gunshot )
 Julia (sobbing): NO!

1227
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,887
THE GAME IS OVER.

1228
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,889
( Teddy groans )
 TAKE IT EASY.

1229
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,596
TAKE IT EASY.

1230
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,831
BETTER GET AN AMBULANCE.

1231
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:17,065
FORGET ABOUT THE AMBULANCE.

1232
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,801
GO GET THE CAR. WE'LL TAKE HIM
IN THE CAR. PUT HIM DOWN HERE.

1233
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:23,905
OKAY.  EASY, EASY.

1234
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,608
OHH...

1235
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:29,644
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1236
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:34,049
( grunts, coughs )
I'M SORRY, OSCAR.

1237
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:37,085
NO, MAN, IT'S ME 
THAT'S SORRY.

1238
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,721
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I NEVER WANTED JIMMY RAY

1239
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,389
TO GET TO YOU.

1240
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:44,726
PLEASE BELIEVE THAT.

1241
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:51,132
YOU KNOW, THAT DARKNESS IN
THE LIGHT--IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

1242
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:54,135
IT'S MY FAULT. MY FAULT.

1243
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:56,071
JUST DON'T TALK ANYMORE.

1244
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,372
COME ON.

1245
01:27:57,372 --> 01:28:01,042
OKAY, GET HIM UP.

1246
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,944
( groaning )
 EASY.

1247
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,552
GOT HIS LEG?

1248
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:13,655
( siren wails )
 I'M GOING WITH YOU.

1249
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:14,856
NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING WITH ME.

1250
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,826
TAKE HER TO THE STATION.

1251
01:28:17,826 --> 01:28:18,960
TEDDY?

1252
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,496
TEDDY, I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ME

1253
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:23,999
IF I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

1254
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:26,134
COME ON, COME ON.

1255
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,836
HEY! EASY.

1256
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,874
HERE ARE THE DIAMONDS.

1257
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:36,711
THIS GUYS SAYS HE KNOWS YOU.

1258
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:37,746
YOU WANNA TALK TO HIM?

1259
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:42,117
WELL, I GOT THE DIAMONDS AND
JIMMY RAY TOOK CARE OF TEDDY.

1260
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:44,552
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

1261
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:48,890
DON'T BE SUCH A HYPOCRITE.

1262
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,025
COME HERE.

1263
01:28:50,025 --> 01:28:52,427
( crying )
 SIT DOWN.

1264
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,200
YOU'RE FREE TO GO, YOU KNOW.

1265
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,703
( continues crying )
 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO

1266
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:07,809
CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.

1267
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,477
I DID?

1268
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:13,815
I SENT YOU IN THERE TWO YEARS
AGO TO GET JIMMY RAY.

1269
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,584
BUT YOU ENDED UP
LIVING WITH HIM.

1270
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:18,186
HE CARED ABOUT ME.

1271
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,155
I CARED ABOUT YOU.

1272
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:24,192
I COULD HAVE PUT YOU IN JAIL
FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING.

1273
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:28,029
BUT I FELT SORRY FOR YOU.

1274
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,099
YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME?

1275
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:36,137
DON'T YOU MEAN YOU WERE
OBSESSED WITH ME?

1276
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:38,807
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

1277
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:42,177
THAT YOU WERE OBSESSED WITH ME
AND YOU COULDN'T STAND IT THAT

1278
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:45,647
I STAYED WITH JIMMY RAY?

1279
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:48,883
I DIDN'T CAUSE THIS.

1280
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,052
YOU DID.

1281
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,989
HEY...

1282
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:56,124
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

1283
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:27,555
DID YOU HAVE TROUBLE
FINDING IT?

1284
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,759
NO. THANK YOU.

1285
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:36,297
HE IS FORTUNATE,
FOR NOW HE IS FREE.

1286
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:46,174
HE IS NO LONGER BOUND BY
THE DARKNESS OF HIS PAST.

1287
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:48,576
I ENVY HIM.

1288
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,112
I MISS HIM.

1289
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,984
GOODBYE, TEDDY.

1290
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,335
YOUR POLICEMAN FRIEND
HAS GIVEN YOU

1291
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:17,172
THE GIFT OF DEATH.

1292
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:20,708
NOW YOU CAN BEGIN A NEW LIFE.

1293
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:24,679
WHAT DO I DO FIRST?

1294
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:27,015
YOU MUST BURY HER.

1295
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:30,785
