1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,005
Well, let's go see
If we can find any cars.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,640
Hot rod hunter richard rawlings.

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,776
And master mechanic
Aaron kaufman.

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,044
Get all hot and bothered...

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,481
When a 1980 el camino arrives.

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,082
At the shop to shake things up.

7
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,317
Earthquake test!

8
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:21,587
And aaron gambles
To monkey it up in record time.

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,689
It's a bet! -This one
will be Blistering fast.

10
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,957
What's over The wall, aaron?

11
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,359
But as richard
Stumbles onto buried treasure...

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,727
Holy cow.

13
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,063
And considers an epic gamble
Of his own...

14
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,631
I could just buy
The whole thing, all of it.

15
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,868
The elco build tumbles
Head-first into trouble.

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,904
- Nothing lines up.
- Richard's gonna be pissed.

17
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,839
It's a week
Where all bets are off.

18
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,241
Here goes nothing.

19
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,376
Will all this monkey business
Lift the crew's spirits.

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,711
To new heights...

21
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,545
Yes!

22
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,080
Or leave them crying...

23
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,048
Come on!
We got to make money, dude.

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,717
In the dark?

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,452
Good lord.

26
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,754
You have the world's largest
Poison ivy farm in dallas.

27
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,022
No, I don't.

28
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,394
Captions paid for by
Discovery communications

29
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,529
I thought Texas was sizzling,

30
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,431
But phoenix is brutal.

31
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,332
100, 115 is hot.

32
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,834
So, we came out
To phoenix today,

33
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:10,402
Which is just one
Of my favorite places.

34
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,037
But it's, like, 187 degrees.

35
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:16,308
And it's miserable hot.
I mean... Horrible.

36
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,677
Well, at least I'm in here
And not out there.

37
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:19,711
This is pretty good.

38
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,046
I must be moving up
In the world.

39
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,348
I get to get chauffeured around
Now to go buy cars.

40
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,583
Monkey chauffeur.

41
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,419
The only reason
We're enduring this heat.

42
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,555
Is that I was poking around
On the internet the other day.

43
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,290
And clicked on a particular
Vehicle for sale.

44
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,858
That both aaron and I
Have been wanting to build.

45
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,159
For a long time.

46
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,994
Is that right here?
This cream puff sitting outside.

47
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,397
- God, look at that thing.
- That with those wire hubcaps.

48
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,666
- I got dibs on those.
- That is what I'm talking about.

49
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,034
Kickass.

50
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,169
I love it! Man.

51
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,871
El camino!

52
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,239
Sit tight, america!

53
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:49,274
In just seconds,
We're going to show you.

54
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,143
A truck we think
Is truly amazing...

55
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,313
The 1980 chevy el camino.

56
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,515
Since they first
Popped on the scene in 1959,

57
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,518
Americans have both loved
And laughed at chevy el caminos.

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,919
Chevy called it a truck.

59
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,455
But it was actually based
On a station wagon wheelbase.

60
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,791
So it's a little bit of both
Or some of neither.

61
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,693
My parents Actually had a 1980.

62
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:09,394
But by then,
They were much smaller,

63
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:12,130
Much more square and much
Less brawn under the hood.

64
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,233
They're kind of weird,
But I've kind of got.

65
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,901
A, you know, soft spot
In my heart for them.

66
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,236
Pretty slick.

67
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,504
If this one's in good shape,

68
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,405
It could be a lot of fun
To play around.

69
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,406
What's up, guys?

70
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:22,441
- Hey, sir.
- What's going on, man?

71
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,709
Richard rawlings. Calvin.

72
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,043
- Calvin, how you doing?
- Pleasure.

73
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,445
Aaron. Nice to meet you.

74
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:27,446
How you doing? I'm charles.
Pleasure to meet you.

75
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,547
Hey, nice to meet you.

76
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,483
So, Your dad Bought this new?

77
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,784
Brand new. Right off the lot.

78
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,387
- Rad!
- 1980, portland, oregon.

79
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,223
When he passed away 9 years ago,
I took possession of it.

80
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,692
And it's been here in phoenix,
Arizona, ever since.

81
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,661
That's o.G. Right there.
What is this, velvet?

82
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,530
At first glance, it seemed to be
In pretty good shape,

83
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,532
Especially considering
It's over 35 years old.

84
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,333
But we did know Going into it.

85
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,402
That it had
An older repaint on it.

86
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,837
One thing that I'm
Always leery of.

87
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,805
Is, like, a cheap paint job
Maybe hiding.

88
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,340
A lot of damage or bondo.

89
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,808
Was there any body damage
When it got painted.

90
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,110
Or did it just get Baked off?

91
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,811
No, it just got baked off.

92
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,046
Open the hood.
What motor's in it?

93
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,248
It's probably hot.

94
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,183
This, here, is a 305.

95
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,686
So that's probably
A whopping 182 horsepower in it.

96
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,922
On the day it was born,
Definitely ain't that now.

97
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,890
- I would say more like 80.
- Can I take it for a test drive?

98
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,526
Sure.

99
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,596
Daggone. The key's hot.

100
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:18,630
Wait for me.

101
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,633
Did I mention
It's about 187 degrees?

102
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,904
Miserable hot.

103
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,242
Well, obviously, we're
Gonna have to fix that problem.

104
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,744
Yeah, it's really, like,
More of a cruiser.

105
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,316
Look at that power! Not!

106
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,985
Cruising in the el camino!

107
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,753
Traffic circle
Coming up, want to do it?

108
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,822
Yeah! Let her rip, Tater chip!

109
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,994
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on! Come on!

110
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,930
I tried to do a burnout,
Slinging around the corner.

111
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,532
Go...

112
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,733
Not happening.

113
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,369
Those '14s, they were
Sticking to the ground.

114
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,704
Probably 'cause it's
So damn hot here.

115
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,173
It's fricking, like,
187 degrees right now.

116
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,408
Come on. Come on.

117
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,509
Yeah, yeah!

118
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,178
I think That's about all it had.

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,647
That definitely failed
The richard-burnout test.

120
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,849
I don't care. I've always
Loved these g-bodies.

121
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,018
Charles is right.
The cool thing about these cars.

122
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,886
Is they're built on
The same g-body platform.

123
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,689
As the chevy sedans, like
The malibu and the monte carlo,

124
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,325
Which means there's a ton
Of after-market parts for them.

125
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,493
It's rad!

126
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,095
You can't go wrong
With a car like this.

127
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,330
Awesome, man! Well...

128
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,065
I guess it is
What you said it is.

129
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,500
So... How much You want for it?

130
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,235
I'd like $10,000
For it, richard.

131
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,174
I think she...
I think she's worth it.

132
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,845
Good god, man. $10,000.

133
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,647
$10,000?

134
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,182
I would like to sell
One of these for $10,000.

135
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,184
So, no surprise, he throws out
A pretty big number.

136
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,086
For a car like this,
Even in good condition.

137
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,588
So 10? I'm not going there.

138
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,289
I know, And this is broken.

139
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,457
Yep.

140
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,259
You know, hit me
With a price, richard.

141
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,728
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking about $6,500.

142
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,929
$6,500?

143
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,698
- $6,500.
- I can't do it, man.

144
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,199
How about 9, richard?

145
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,036
Yeah, you're getting there,
But I'm thinking 7.

146
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,437
Still a little low.

147
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,340
- It's so damn hot here.
- I can't even think.

148
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,642
- Let's get it over with.
- What is it, like, 187 degrees?

149
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,978
Let's just shake on $8,000.
$8,000?

150
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,047
All right,
We're shaking. We own it.

151
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,982
I like your style.

152
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,984
Eight grand, I think,
Is fair for the car.

153
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,452
I would have liked to have
Gotten it a little bit cheaper.

154
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,887
But it's a good car
To start with.

155
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,555
Yank out that anemic motor.

156
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,223
And throw something
Big and badass in,

157
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,792
Scare women and children,
We're good to go.

158
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,627
Let's do some paperwork.
You got cold beer in the fridge?

159
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,695
Right this way.

160
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,363
Hey, I think
You're gonna have to pass.

161
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,465
You got a long way to get
That thing back to dallas.

162
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,733
Hope you got Your "Aaa" card.

163
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,767
Really like this car.

164
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,169
Growing up, man,
It was one of the cars.

165
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,637
That I always wanted to build.

166
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,872
I'ma put my own little touch
On it on the way home.

167
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,808
The el camino
Is now the el cimino.

168
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,713
- You got to be kidding me.
- No a.C.?

169
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,151
Aah!

170
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:29,354
1,000 miles with no a.C.
In the summer!

171
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,856
You all right? Sweet!

172
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,023
You made it back From arizona?

173
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,325
Man, I would have
Had the windows down.

174
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,427
- That window doesn't work!
- You want some water?

175
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,628
Yeah.

176
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,896
Well, here.

177
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,997
Have some.

178
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,300
Well, you need
To get up and work now.

179
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,770
You already did the easy part.
You drove here.

180
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,505
I mean, you give a guy
What amounts to, practically,

181
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,006
A paid vacation driving through.

182
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,342
The uncharted pass
Of our great country.

183
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,543
And what do you get?

184
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,112
Just complain,
Complain, complain.

185
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,680
Wow, it's really
Starting to come down out there.

186
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,682
Who cares about that?

187
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,918
I want to know what you think
About my el cimino.

188
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,453
An el cimino,
What does that mean?

189
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:02,554
Is that, like,
A different model?

190
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,156
It's charles cimino.

191
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,825
- Gotcha.
- No.

192
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,360
I don't know.

193
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,495
El caminos are, like,
Kind of a weird thing.

194
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,430
Somebody has an el camino,
You're not real sure about it.

195
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,767
It's like people who own vans
With no windows.

196
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,272
It's kind of a different
Type of person, right?

197
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,774
I'm not really big
On el caminos.

198
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,776
I've never restored
Or rebuilt one.

199
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,511
But it's kind of a cool car.
It's clean.

200
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,213
Earthquake test.

201
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,148
Whoa.

202
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,683
Suspension needs A little work.

203
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,485
That doesn't sound Super well.

204
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,553
Well, the motor's
Definitely nothing

205
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,754
I'd write home about.

206
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,523
Yeah, it's pretty
Much worthless.

207
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,226
It's hot an awful lot
Of shiny stuff on it.

208
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,594
So what are we Gonna do with it?

209
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,830
Charles wants to name it
El cimino and take it home.

210
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,164
I want to paint it
Like a low rider.

211
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,132
I just don't want it.

212
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:47,999
What about you, sir?

213
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,034
I want to see it go fast.

214
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,002
Heck yeah. Gas monkey it up.

215
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,270
So, what are we
Gonna do with it?

216
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,338
Let me ask you
A crazy question...

217
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,339
What do we do With all of them?

218
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,473
Make them cool.

219
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,043
So here's the plan.

220
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,612
For our little shady
'80 el camino.

221
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,047
Basically,
It's not really a car.

222
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,448
And it's not really a truck.

223
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,851
But what we're gonna do
Is make it so sexy and so fast,

224
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,352
It will stick a smile
On your face.

225
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:10,388
And keep it plastered there
For a long, long time.

226
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,290
The first step will be
To lower the altitude.

227
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,391
And raise the performance,

228
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,594
Which will yield a ton
More attitude.

229
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,995
We will slam it down
And motivate it.

230
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,464
With a mass black label
Ls3 engine.

231
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,732
Coupled to a t56,

232
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,368
It should produce
About 630 horsepower.

233
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,403
Once we increase the rubber
Presence substantially,

234
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,072
Add some big brakes
To stop all that power.

235
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,406
And update the gauges
And upholstery,

236
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,775
This car will have
A new lease on life.

237
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:31,676
And we don't want To mess around.

238
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,211
With the classic el camino look,

239
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,146
Or why start with
An el camino at all?

240
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,282
And since it's black,
We're gonna keep it black.

241
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,850
Now, mike, I know
That's a lot of work for you.

242
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,318
But too bad.

243
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,954
But we are going to
Remove a lot of the bright work.

244
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,223
And then narrow and tuck
Those big, wide bumpers.

245
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,424
To clean up the lines.

246
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,859
The great thing is,
Is since it's a g-body,

247
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,294
It's on a gm platform,

248
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,830
Which means all the parts for it
Should be fairly easy to get.

249
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,698
So I told aaron
I would give him 4 weeks.

250
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,400
And $30,000 to get it done.

251
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,534
And you know what he said?

252
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,570
Four weeks?
I will do you one better.

253
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,139
I bet I can even have
This thing done in three.

254
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,742
Three weeks? I mean, only
A sucker would pass up that bet.

255
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,076
If you ask aaron
What time it is,

256
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,811
He's gonna tell you
How to build a watch.

257
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,480
So, I don't know how
He's gonna finish a project.

258
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,316
Like this in 3 weeks
To his satisfaction.

259
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,853
A g-body? Three weeks?
It's entirely doable.

260
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,088
I just don't see that much that
Could go wrong with this one.

261
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,456
This one will be
Blistering fast.

262
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,358
It's a bet!

263
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,093
I guess we can't
Play outside today.

264
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,796
We might as well start
Tearing this thing apart.

265
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,265
Hey, who needs another motor
Since we're taking this one out?

266
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,733
- Whoa!
- Good lord.

267
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,371
What the hell.

268
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,373
Yeah.

269
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,943
Coming up... I want to rack it.

270
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,311
Aaron's need for speed.

271
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,146
Hits the skids from the start.

272
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,014
I think I want to play
Around with those bumpers.

273
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,016
Knew it was Too good to be true.

274
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,217
So you got Some cars in here.

275
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,119
And tricky ricky goes big...

276
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,988
Wow... Real big.

277
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,222
I will pay you $500,000.

278
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,879
Well, we've got
Blue skies, power.

279
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:58,813
Let's get this show On the road.

280
00:09:58,815 --> 00:09:59,914
Body seems pretty...

281
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,315
I don't think our job's
Gonna be too bad.

282
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,483
Hope not.

283
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:03,618
Well, at least it
Doesn't look that rusty.

284
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,852
Well, cool.
We will make it look good.

285
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,187
Y'all make it run good.
It will be fast.

286
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,321
That's all that matters.

287
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:08,489
All right. I want to rack it.

288
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,858
Yeah. Let's
Just pull it forward.

289
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,861
So our humble goal
For this 1980 el camino.

290
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,163
Is to lower the altitude,
Beef up the performance.

291
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:19,200
And, thereby, gave it
A much meaner attitude.

292
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,568
That lowered it, Like, 3 inches.

293
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,836
- Shut up.
- Yeah, it did.

294
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:27,642
With a plethora
Of after-market parts available.

295
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:28,943
For this g-body frame,

296
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,544
I'm willing to bet
We can finish this thing.

297
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,879
In a quick 3 weeks.

298
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,347
And I'm willing
To bet that, you know,

299
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,715
His mind starts
Going on this thing.

300
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,183
And swirls around
Out of control,

301
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,785
And he finds a way
To stretch this out.

302
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,747
You know... you know
What I'm talking about, guys.

303
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,227
Aaron's definitely not
Playing around this time.

304
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,862
We are off to a fast start.

305
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,297
We already have parts
Coming in for this thing,

306
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:51,666
And we don't even
Have it torn down yet.

307
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:54,568
- Already ready.
- And miracle of miracles,

308
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,203
He's even talking
About moving it over.

309
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:59,073
To paint and body
Right away, like, today.

310
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,876
So tony and I can have
Adequate time, for once,

311
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,678
To finally pull off
The flawless paint job.

312
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,012
That this garage is known for.

313
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:07,014
All right, soon as
Those bumpers are off,

314
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,115
Give me a shout,
And we will go ahead.

315
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,550
And roll it over To my place.

316
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,852
You know what?

317
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,554
Let's hold off For a few hours.

318
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,056
I think I want to play around
With those bumpers.

319
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,457
Before the new ones Come in.

320
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,859
I knew it was
Too good to be true.

321
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,195
Don't get your panties
In a bunch, mike.

322
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,330
This won't take too long.

323
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,731
You want to sit up first?

324
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:24,966
Here's the deal

325
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:26,968
I hate the rubber trim
On the factory bumpers,

326
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,936
Which is not really a problem
Because john's already found.

327
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,871
Replacement bumpers
That don't have all that mess.

328
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,274
But I am planning on doing
Some cutting and splicing.

329
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,542
On the new ones.

330
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:36,210
They're bigger
Than truck bumpers.

331
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,845
And they hang off on the ends.

332
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:39,513
So, I actually wanted
To make them narrower.

333
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,549
So they fit the car
Much tighter.

334
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,851
I'm thinking instead of rushing
This thing on into paint,

335
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,019
Why not take a few hours.

336
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,687
And use the old bumpers
As guinea pigs.

337
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,622
To try and figure out
What's gonna work best?

338
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,424
So, what I might do is
Find the last place.

339
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,393
That we can make
A clean cut here,

340
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:53,995
Go ahead and...
And make that cut.

341
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,763
And then, we will start
Working the chunk out here.

342
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,299
And start moving it over.

343
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,300
It's simple math.

344
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,601
Spend a little bit of time now,

345
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,436
Save a lot of time
Down the line.

346
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,505
Yeah.

347
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,641
Get out here, aaron.

348
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,411
Time and richard rawlings
Wait for no man.

349
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,645
Thank you.

350
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,848
All right,
I put a fresh shirt on for this.

351
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,182
It better be worth it.

352
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,083
Where are we headed?

353
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,519
Hold on.

354
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,488
So this, Guy just called me.

355
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,124
And, he said, I guess,
His family member died.

356
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,725
And there's a bunch
Of cars on the property.

357
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,293
So the rest of
The family's out of state.

358
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,863
They just want to sell the cars
So that they can sell the house.

359
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,364
So any time you hear about
An estate sale,

360
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,565
You can't help
But get your hopes up.

361
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,800
That there's A one-of-a-kind car.

362
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,435
That's been hidden away
In a garage for years.

363
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,337
Just ripe for the picking.

364
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,039
I said, "Where are you?"
Lakewood.

365
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,407
I said, "Well, dude,
What's the address?"

366
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:40,408
We will come over."

367
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,575
And this estate Is in, well,

368
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:42,977
A pretty prominent
Neighborhood in dallas.

369
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,145
So, I'm feeling lucky.

370
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,980
Who knows what
We're gonna find here?

371
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,348
Here we go.

372
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,083
Looks a little overgrown.

373
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,718
Absolute pile of doo-doo.

374
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,486
That must be The family's agent.

375
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:53,521
You steve? Yes, sir.

376
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,789
Richard rawlings.
How's it going, man?

377
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,689
Doing well, man. Cool.

378
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,957
Steve. Aaron.

379
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,559
- Nice to meet you, aaron.
- So, what happened.

380
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,927
To this place, man?

381
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:01,929
This place looks like it's,
A little run down.

382
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,331
Neglect, abandonment.

383
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,933
So you got some cars In here?

384
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:07,168
- Yes, sir.
- Where?

385
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,136
'Round back, man.
They're all hidden.

386
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,706
Man. This is gonna be work.

387
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,277
Wow.

388
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,679
Well, the jeep,
Convertible thing here,

389
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,181
That's a hurst edition.

390
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,283
I think they're pretty rare.
We roam all around the property.

391
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,418
And it's... It's totally crazy.

392
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,587
Stuff stacked on stuff
Stacked on stuff.

393
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,456
Wherever something broke,
That's where it was.

394
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,225
Well, the lincoln's worthless.
The 'vette's not bad.

395
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,860
Chrome bumper front and backs,
That's, like, what, a '70?

396
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,462
'71, I think.

397
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:36,831
Well, that honda's
Pretty fricking cool.

398
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,399
And the rolls,
What year is that?

399
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,700
'61.

400
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,735
They built a shed, and then,
When they filled it with crap,

401
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,471
They needed a new place to work,
So they build another shed,

402
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,840
And they filled it with crap,
Then built another shed.

403
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,908
And the sheds progressively
Got worse and worse.

404
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,310
Don't... don't... d...

405
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,245
I don't weigh enough To hurt it.

406
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,613
Now, that's rad.

407
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,381
That's a pretty good
Shape king midget.

408
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,916
Mini-van.

409
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,185
Aaron, soon as you get married
And have some kids,

410
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,753
Here's your future.

411
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,754
I want to see in the house.

412
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,857
Before I make
Any kind of car deal.

413
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,358
Golly. Is it safe?

414
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,760
Somewhat, just got to
Watch your step, man.

415
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,395
Coming down's A little scarier

416
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,331
'cause that spot where
Aaron's standing right now.

417
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,866
Is really not the strongest
Step in the world.

418
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,267
Holy crap.

419
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,436
Holy cow.

420
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,371
Sheesh.

421
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,006
The house was Built in 1928.

422
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:22,209
It is, like, in such a state
Of disrepair, disarray...

423
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,444
Yeah.

424
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,045
He's got a bust
Of richard rawlings.

425
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,082
Wow. It's crazy.

426
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,717
But it wasn't sitting
On four wheels.

427
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:32,219
And that is What I came for.

428
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:33,988
There's a couple
That could be worth some money.

429
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,756
The problem is,
Is I can't get to the ones

430
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,424
I want without getting
The other ones out of the way,

431
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,860
And if I'm gonna touch them,
I might as well drag them off.

432
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,029
So what's the package deal
For all of them?

433
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,631
Probably 60,000, 65,000.

434
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,033
Really? There's no way.

435
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,035
He's telling me
$60,000 to $65,000.

436
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:51,005
I mean, there's $6,000
To $6,500 worth of cars here,

437
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,473
Tops. High side.

438
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,874
High side. I mean, not really.

439
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,409
There's probably
20,000 worth of...

440
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:57,611
Come on!

441
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,146
You know, I might
Just need something else.

442
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,748
To sweeten this deal.

443
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,485
What's the dealio with
The whole piece of property?

444
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,886
He's looking
For investors to buy it.

445
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:07,321
My mind started
Turning and I'm like,

446
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,989
"It's a very historical
Neighborhood.

447
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,292
People pay a little extra
To be in this part of the city."

448
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,260
I could just buy
The whole thing.

449
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:14,228
All the cars?

450
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,197
No, all of it.

451
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,464
Dirt, property, house?

452
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:18,699
All of it.

453
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,467
Are you able To make a deal?

454
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,169
I could give The owner a call.

455
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,271
My number will be low.

456
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,607
- I will pay you 500 grand.
- 500 grand?

457
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:29,009
That's it, in cash.
I can close now.

458
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,678
Don't need
Anything but a survey.

459
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,746
And if not 500 grand,
I don't even want the cars.

460
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,749
- I will just leave.
- All right.

461
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,953
At $500,000
It's got to be $700,000.

462
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:41,555
And it's just like a car.
You just buy it and flip it.

463
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,560
All right, talked to him.
He said he will do it.

464
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,195
Really?

465
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,563
500k. 500k.

466
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,265
It's yours.

467
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,567
I fully did not expect
For him to say yes.

468
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:54,501
All right. I don't know that...

469
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:57,037
I'm usually excited,
But I'm not.

470
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,472
Guess I'm in
The real estate business.

471
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:00,975
This is where I'm usually happy.
But I don't... Golly.

472
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,876
I just dished out
A half a million dollars.

473
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,379
So speed is Of the essence.

474
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,147
Plan on this is
Get in and get out.

475
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,816
As quick As humanly possible.

476
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:09,850
And my first step Is gonna be.

477
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:11,185
To try to unload
Some of these cars.

478
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,721
Before I even have
To move them off the property.

479
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:14,855
You know what they say.
You don't make your money.

480
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,457
When you sell, you make
Your money when you buy.

481
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,159
So since you made
About 100k or more,

482
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,494
I'd say lunch is on you.

483
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,996
Did I already make that?

484
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:22,998
Sounds like it.

485
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,434
I'm just gonna sit here
And enjoy my new porch.

486
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,535
Before it Falls in on me.

487
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:42,950
Dang, webster, you still working
On that back bumper?

488
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,485
Yeah, it's a little
More complicated.

489
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,020
Than I anticipated.

490
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,455
I think it's time to call in
Reinforcements.

491
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,191
So you're gonna make me work
On the front bumper?

492
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:52,426
I was really hoping...
Well, I'm not...

493
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,927
You were gonna do
Both the bumpers.

494
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,729
I'm not gonna make you.
I'm gonna ask you.

495
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,997
'Cause I've got, like...

496
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,198
- will you help with the...
- A sandwich to go eat.

497
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,933
Yeah, well, will you help
With the bumpers?

498
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,935
Yeah, sure.

499
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,905
So cutting down a bumper
Seems like a simple project.

500
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:08,108
But any cosmetic change like
This can open up a can of worms.

501
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,477
For instance, the back bumper
That webster's working on.

502
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,313
Has a subtle art to it.

503
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:14,415
You got to go slow
And make smart decisions.

504
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,749
When cutting out a chunk.

505
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:18,385
Because you still need
To preserve the overall line.

506
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:20,354
But, luckily for me,

507
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,289
On the front bumper,
We've got a crown.

508
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,291
So I should be able
To take it out of the middle,

509
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,492
Suck it up tight.

510
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,528
And if we can just do one seam,

511
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,330
That's gonna speed up
The process quite a bit.

512
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,002
And there were two.

513
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,440
Yeah.

514
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,708
I think it's pretty cool.

515
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,545
Right now, I'm just gonna tack
Weld the seam the together.

516
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,779
You want to test fit?

517
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:46,847
Sure. Need a hand?

518
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:47,881
To stay on schedule,

519
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,249
We need to get
This finished today.

520
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,951
Right here is Like this for me.

521
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:53,520
But I can't go any further
Until a certain someone.

522
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,590
With incredibly high
Expectations gives the okay.

523
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,325
Will that happen? Hopefully.

524
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,593
- I'm hoping so, too.
- See what happens.

525
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,595
Yeah, no kidding.

526
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:05,099
This is what
You're going for, right?

527
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,134
Bingo. That's the one. 100%.

528
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:10,070
Got a nice peak in the center,
So that works on the front.

529
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:11,572
Yeah. Rock and roll.

530
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:12,806
It's a little bit over
On that side.

531
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:14,308
On the shortening Up on these,

532
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,177
These actually
Will slide, you know.

533
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,479
They're adjustable?

534
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,848
They're collapsible this way
If you drill them.

535
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,282
Yep, and then you can
Knock it back...

536
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,817
And then weld it.
Weld it up, yeah.

537
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,452
When we're in the middle
Of a modification like this,

538
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,388
My mind's always
Going a mile a minute.

539
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,590
Because there's a million little
Things that need addressing.

540
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:32,459
At some point, you have
To make the fill piece, too,

541
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,161
Because of the way it comes
In and wraps around.

542
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,231
So just because it meets up here
Doesn't mean it's done.

543
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,166
Yeah,
I wouldn't mind going ahead.

544
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,034
And cutting this
And popping this down.

545
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,204
And filling that gap so that
The car has one clean slope up.

546
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,573
And everything all fits
Real natural, looks real normal.

547
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:48,942
That's where I tend to get
Into trouble with old ricardo.

548
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:50,811
I want our finished product
To look like it came off.

549
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,546
The factory floor that way.

550
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,782
And that's not always
Easy to pull off.

551
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,984
This right here,
This really doesn't look bad.

552
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,385
Problem is, though,
Is it's gonna make this.

553
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,653
Weird little edge on here.

554
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,022
So, we might actually
Have to cut it and rotate.

555
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,791
The whole thing, You know?

556
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,392
Otherwise, you're gonna have
This big crease here.

557
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,661
And there's no other crease
Down this side of the car.

558
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:10,063
You know, so that's
Really strange.

559
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,633
The edge is kind of tucked a bit
More than it is in the center.

560
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:15,035
It'd be nice if this center
Landed appropriately.

561
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,371
On top of the bumper, like,
If this right here come down,

562
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,972
If this was just Underneath it,

563
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,841
That would be
Really, really nice.

564
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:23,343
It seems like a pain in the ass
And a waste of time.

565
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,512
But believe me,
It will be worth it.

566
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,847
All in all, I'm really happy.

567
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,182
With the way the bumpers
Are shaping up.

568
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,451
So I think I'm going
To push paint another day.

569
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,387
I think it's more important
To get this right, right now.

570
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,590
Yeah. That's a, a, a-okay, man.

571
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,091
That looks really nice.
That's great.

572
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,259
Okay.

573
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,561
Well, That went pretty well.

574
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:43,263
I mean, hey, at least
We don't have to take steps back.

575
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,631
And restart a different idea.

576
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,000
That happens a lot
When you're dealing with aaron.

577
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,903
So that's a huge win for us.

578
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,939
Yes!

579
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,474
Coming up...

580
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:54,842
Whoa! Don't Go fast, dude!

581
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:57,878
Richard tries to flip his new
Find onto an old friend.

582
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,080
Price just went up.

583
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,148
Get this thing Into the booth.

584
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,950
And the el camino
Build goes dark...

585
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,884
We don't have No power, dude.

586
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,519
At a critical stage.

587
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,154
Least he can't blame
Aaron for this one.

588
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:08,655
I don't know. Bet's a bet.

589
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,830
Let's make this quick, guys.
It's frickin' hot out here.

590
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,365
- We're going straight in?
- Yeah, go straight in.

591
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:18,367
Okay.

592
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:21,302
There we go.

593
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,337
How are you
On your clearance over here?

594
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,041
- All right.
- Hey, mike.

595
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,510
Got a delivery for you. Thanks.

596
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:32,113
Except I was expecting
It two days ago.

597
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:33,948
Hey, Better late than never.

598
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,983
And when you buy
This car from richard...

599
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,184
I ain't buying this car
From richard.

600
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:39,220
You get this motor.

601
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:41,289
Comes with one horsepower.

602
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,259
Nobody wants that motor.

603
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,430
That's the motor
Everybody pulls out.

604
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,499
So, I guess aaron
Okayed the plan.

605
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,168
For cutting down the new bumpers
Coming in for our el camino

606
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,530
'cause he's finally letting me
And tony get our hands on it.

607
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:02,109
I think this thing's gonna be
Pretty cool, actually.

608
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,712
I think once the suspension's on
And it's hammered down...

609
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:07,381
And it's got that
Na-ha-hasty motor in it.

610
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:08,416
Yeah.

611
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,685
Yep, this thing
Will be pretty tasty.

612
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,953
From what I hear,

613
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,220
Aaron really wants to stay
On schedule with this

614
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:14,755
'cause he's got some kind
Of bet with richard.

615
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:18,225
That he can't finish on time
Or something like that.

616
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,061
There's not much
I can do to help.

617
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:22,129
Car's staying black,
And, as you guys know by now,

618
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:24,599
You got to work longer
And harder on a black car

619
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:26,467
'cause every
Imperfection will show.

620
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:27,935
We're on "Painter time."

621
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,671
So it's gonna be at least 3 days
Before we get to send to prime.

622
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:32,673
And another week before
They see it on their side.

623
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,217
Come on, dude. You're supposed
To be here by now.

624
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,418
I haven't got all day.

625
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,487
Yeah! Claremont,
Cerrito, corner house.

626
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:47,722
There's a broken piece
Of the fence.

627
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:51,459
Just come...
Yeah, just come through there.

628
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,893
Really?

629
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,795
So, a couple of days
Ago, I came out here to lakewood.

630
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:56,030
To check out a nest of cars.

631
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,999
And, well, ended up
With that nest of cars

632
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,801
<I>and a house for $500,000.

633
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:04,105
I mean, that's a lot of money.
So speed is of the essence.

634
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,307
I got to get off this much money
Really, really quick.

635
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,609
You were supposed
To park and walk in.

636
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,078
It's a respectable
Neighborhood, man.

637
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,780
Doesn't look like it.

638
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:14,448
Well, not this general
Area right here.

639
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,783
- What's up?
- What happened here?

640
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:17,018
Welcome to my first foyer.

641
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,453
Into massive
Flipping real estate.

642
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:21,422
I don't care about that.
I just want to see the jeep.

643
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,757
Well, there you go.

644
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,527
It's a hurst 4 speed.
Or is it 3?

645
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:27,795
You don't know, do you?

646
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:30,131
I have no idea, dude.
You're the jeep guy.

647
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,566
I called dennis because
There's a jeep commando here.

648
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,235
I know it's rare.
I don't know how rare.

649
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,203
But let's just start
The money flowing in.

650
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,039
Well, it looks like
It's real just from the paint.

651
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:40,241
He was right.

652
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,742
It is a hurst commando.

653
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:43,477
Those are incredibly
Hard to find.

654
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,346
What'd they make?
Like, 200, 300?

655
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:47,214
100... when these were
On the production line,

656
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,349
Behind the battery box,

657
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,084
They put a crayon mark
On what number it was.

658
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,586
So this was number 18.
That's very cool.

659
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,989
Price just went up.
You shouldn't have told me that.

660
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:57,458
I knew I wanted it, so
Here we go on the negotiations.

661
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
This thing weighs
About 2,500 pounds.

662
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:00,594
So what does that mean?

663
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,431
It's probably worth
About $2,500.

664
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:04,799
I'm not selling it
By weight, fool!

665
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,333
You got to start somewhere.

666
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,869
Even though were best friends,
And almost everybody knows that,

667
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:10,204
He always starts high.

668
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,040
I say $5,000. What?

669
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,142
Or he thought he did. He didn't.

670
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,977
$3,500, go on To the next one.

671
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,380
All right, $3,500, it's yours.

672
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,082
Whatever, dennis.
You can have it for $3,500.

673
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,551
Let's move on and see if I can
Sell him some more crap.

674
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:26,320
All right, so what do you think
Is cool down here?

675
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,856
I like the honda.
I'm in for 500 on that one.

676
00:23:28,858 --> 00:23:30,458
This car's A hardtop four-door.

677
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,826
It's too many doors.

678
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,708
Yeah, that's a thomas weeks
Special right there.

679
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,597
So, how much is
This $1,800 corvette?

680
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,999
I think $5,000's fair.

681
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,601
We're not going back and forth.
It's $5,000.

682
00:23:40,603 --> 00:23:42,136
That's how much it is.
And if you want it, great.

683
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:43,504
If you don't, I don't care.

684
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,438
I will sell it to the next guy.

685
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,639
Okay. I'll do it For $5,000.

686
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,274
Cool.

687
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:49,210
You got to buy That for $5,000!

688
00:23:49,212 --> 00:23:51,645
Anybody that's ever had
A pre-'73 corvette.

689
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,813
Knows that's a deal.

690
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,248
This lincoln is free
With purchase.

691
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,250
So now you own that.

692
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,085
So in the end,
I could only talk dennis.

693
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,087
Into taking about
Three cars off my hands,

694
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,590
Which isn't gonna make much
Of a dent in my bank account.

695
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:05,493
- I got to make money, dude.
- I got $500,000 in this.

696
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:06,794
I think you're just
Getting nervous 'cause you have.

697
00:24:06,796 --> 00:24:09,029
The world's largest
Poison ivy farm in dallas.

698
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,798
No, I don't.

699
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,133
All right, come on.

700
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,568
So now, the fun part.

701
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,604
Somebody's got to get
All this crap out of here.

702
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:19,440
My guys are here!

703
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,542
Whoa, don't go fast!

704
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,644
We're On the back here.

705
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,147
I mean, it's a lot of crap.

706
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:27,548
All right.
What do you want to do next?

707
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,070
Yank that lincoln out of the way
So we can get the corvette out.

708
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:33,988
We need to throw the lawn
Mower out of the way.

709
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,824
Can we pick it up?

710
00:24:36,826 --> 00:24:38,859
Where's the strap?
Just hook it to the jeep.

711
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,532
You came With reinforcements.

712
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:45,733
There you go!

713
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,201
If you pull it out
As fast as the lawn mower,

714
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,302
You can have it for free!

715
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:51,705
See you later. Later.

716
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:52,873
Nice doing business
With you, sir.

717
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,375
Now, get that stuff
Off my property.

718
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:56,777
I'm trying to keep
A respectable neighborhood.

719
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,681
Well, it looks like
At least tony was.

720
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,249
Getting something done
While you were playing around.

721
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,551
In that lakewood house.

722
00:25:03,553 --> 00:25:04,985
I think we're good to go.

723
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:07,021
Let's get this thing into
The booth and get it primed.

724
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:08,322
Okay. Onward.

725
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:09,690
I'll Start picking up this.

726
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,125
You want to hit the paint booth
And get it cleaned up?

727
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,626
Yeah, we will get
That ready and going.

728
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:14,595
- All right, phil. Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

729
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,897
Good god, that's heavy.

730
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:20,968
Hey, mike.

731
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,970
What's up?

732
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,839
We ain't got nothing.

733
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:25,841
Did you...

734
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,878
It was working The other day.

735
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,413
Well, you ain't got
To turn them all on.

736
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,381
It should just be that one.
None of them are working.

737
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:35,883
We don't have no power, dude.
That ain't good.

738
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,251
So as painter guys,

739
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:39,386
We don't need much
To do our job.

740
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,155
But we do need one thing.

741
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:42,656
What's going on?

742
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:43,958
We don't Have a paint booth.

743
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,693
Has anybody looked
At the board outside yet?

744
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:46,627
No, it's...

745
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,661
That's where We're headed next.

746
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,231
Let's go check it out.

747
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,265
Well, see what we got.

748
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:52,266
The paint booth,

749
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:53,434
Not only does it provide light.

750
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:54,869
So we can see what we're doing,

751
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,303
It also provides ventilation.

752
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,539
So we don't die
While we're doing it.

753
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:00,841
So needless to say,
It's not a good thing.

754
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,643
That it won't turn on right now.

755
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,144
I'm sure It's just a fuse.

756
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:10,718
Dude, every single one
Of these connectors is burned.

757
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,087
Like, melted.

758
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:14,255
Ooh, dude, I can
Smell that from here.

759
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:15,723
Dude, yeah, it's bad.

760
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:17,524
Well, at least you know why
Your paint booth's not working.

761
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,126
Yeah Hey.

762
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,962
Wow.

763
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:24,298
Was it on when
We got hit by lightning?

764
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,366
I think it was running.

765
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,634
Yeah, I bet that's The problem.

766
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:29,536
Looks like the lightning strike
Strikes again.

767
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:31,605
Well, you know what I mean.

768
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:32,907
I guess when
That lightning strike.

769
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:34,308
Hit that building the other day,

770
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,211
It didn't just blow the fuses.
It fricking melted them.

771
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,646
That's toast. Yeah.

772
00:26:38,648 --> 00:26:41,448
Richard's Gonna be pissed.

773
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,783
Shoot, yeah, That's pretty much.

774
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,618
A lot of money
Burnt up right there.

775
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,920
This situation's Bad enough.

776
00:26:45,922 --> 00:26:47,388
But what makes it even
More annoying.

777
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,023
Is that the lightning
Struck days ago.

778
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,624
And if we'd have had any clue,
We could have fixed it.

779
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,226
While we were mocking up
Bumpers and prepping.

780
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,694
And that doesn't look
Like a quick fix either.

781
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,029
We need to get
An electrician out here.

782
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,197
We're already, what,
2 1/2 days behind on the car.

783
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,532
And now you got No paint booth.

784
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,100
But as it is,
We can't do much else.

785
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:01,769
With the el camino
Until it's painted.

786
00:27:01,771 --> 00:27:04,004
And that's anybody's guess
On when it's gonna happen now.

787
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,439
Look, I'm gonna go
Let richard and aaron.

788
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,807
Know what's going on Because...

789
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,108
- good luck with that.
- That's not gonna be pretty.

790
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,377
Richard can't blame aaron
For this one, can he?

791
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,146
I don't know. A bet's a bet.

792
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:17,117
Coming up...

793
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,687
While charles presses ahead
With work on a king midget...

794
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:21,989
Got a feeling this is supposed
To be attached to the motor.

795
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,457
Let's do that one.
I like that one.

796
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,293
Aaron stalls out
On another big decision.

797
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,729
Man, I just hate
The commitment level.

798
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:44,478
The answer when we return.

799
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,820
The answer is "B".

800
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,422
In march of 2016,

801
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,624
Lady gaga posted
A photo of herself.

802
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:59,626
In her black el camino
With the caption,

803
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:02,329
"Some things
Never go out of style."

804
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:13,907
Hey!

805
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,475
Wait your turn.

806
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:16,977
Dude, where's...
Where's the pictures?

807
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:19,045
There is no pictures.

808
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,047
This book sucks.

809
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,049
All right, guys.
Find something to do.

810
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:25,211
Let's get the shop clean,
At least while we're waiting.

811
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:29,155
So our el camino build's
On life support right now.

812
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,657
Everyone's waiting on paint.

813
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:31,992
The fuse box that powers
The paint booth.

814
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:33,526
Got fried by lightning
The other day.

815
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:34,928
And it's gonna be
A couple more days before.

816
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,030
We can get it up
And running again.

817
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:38,765
That is a dope wheel, Isn't it?

818
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,200
I love them, man. I th... I...

819
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:42,769
I think that is
A righteous setup on that.

820
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:44,204
I want to be able
To burst out of the blocks.

821
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,939
As soon as we get
The green light.

822
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,208
At least aaron's locked down
The look he wants on the wheels.

823
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,143
But he's still got to
Decide on paint,

824
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,746
Which, I mean, you think
Would be easy.

825
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:54,014
Because we know what he wants.

826
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:55,615
It can be any color
As long as it's black.

827
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:57,317
- Yeah, as long as it's black.
- As long as it's black.

828
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,918
But I was kind of Thinking,

829
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,554
Instead of using a straight
Black like we do so often,

830
00:29:01,556 --> 00:29:03,423
What if this was, like,
A tuxedo black that's got the.

831
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:04,591
- On there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,159
We could do a little
Light metallic black.

833
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,427
Hold on, I got something.
Yeah, show me.

834
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,062
It's got a brown flop
To it, though.

835
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:10,730
Is it flop brown. You sure?

836
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:13,300
- Kind of brown-ish gold.
- Brown?

837
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:16,269
Of course, with aaron,
Nothing's ever that easy.

838
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,338
- I know what you're saying now.
- See that gold in it?

839
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,573
That's what gives it
That gold-ish brown.

840
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,976
I think it will look
Like a root beer candy.

841
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,944
I got black forest.
But that's green.

842
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,246
Yeah.

843
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:27,714
You might be surprised
To know there's actually.

844
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:29,616
Hundreds of different blacks.

845
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:31,685
But trust me, aaron isn't.

846
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,688
I bet he's looked at
Every single one of them twice.

847
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,289
I just... I just don't...

848
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:39,159
I just... I mean,
You know what works.

849
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:43,330
I forgot that black with
Metallic looks like rainbow.

850
00:29:43,332 --> 00:29:44,798
I like this.
It's different enough.

851
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,999
Let's do that one.
I like that one.

852
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,201
Do you like that one?
Yeah, I like that black.

853
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,705
Man, I just hate the
Commitment level to doing it.

854
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,006
You got a quarter?

855
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:54,074
Flip it.

856
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:57,811
61.2.

857
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,046
61.2?

858
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,948
So this morning,
Aaron actually asked me.

859
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,883
For a spray-out
Of this metallic black.

860
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,518
With a tiny, Tiny hint of blue.

861
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,956
So hopefully, that means we're
Getting closer to a decision.

862
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,658
All right. Here goes nothing.

863
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,797
I like it. I like it, too.

864
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,135
I do think it's gonna work,
So I'm happy to go with it.

865
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,370
But it makes me
A little nervous.

866
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:24,504
But I say let's do it.

867
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,739
All right. I like it, though.

868
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,107
I like it, too. It's different.

869
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:30,477
So, 16 hours after I asked,
We finally got a decision.

870
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:33,546
For aaron,
That's actually not that bad.

871
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:34,848
Now all we need
Is a paint booth.

872
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:41,588
Still doing All the work.

873
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,023
Yeah, honey.

874
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:46,192
So, things are getting a
Little lackadaisical around here.

875
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:47,427
While we're waiting
On the paint booth.

876
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,862
To get back online.

877
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:51,631
It's taking $4,000 out of
My pocket to fix it, by the way.

878
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:52,899
Aaron's keeping The guys busy,

879
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,334
Molly-maiding around the shop.

880
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,002
But I need to see some
Return on my investments,

881
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,239
And I mean soon, or there won't
Be a shop around to clean.

882
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:00,974
All right, dude.
You ever seen once of these?

883
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,909
No, what is this?

884
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:05,145
Here's your next Little project.

885
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:06,346
It is little.

886
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:09,983
This thing's a, -
It's called a king midget.

887
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:14,154
It has some kind of weird,
Motor in the back.

888
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,289
Um, and, it was
In that collection.

889
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,757
Where I bought the house
And everything.

890
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,526
Yeah. It's almost like
A lawn-mower-looking motor.

891
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:20,794
That's exactly
What it looks like.

892
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,997
Runs on a belt,
Single-side drive with a chain.

893
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,265
I mean, How ridiculous is that?

894
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,667
So pretty much a go kart
With a body on it, kind of?

895
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,135
I guess, man.

896
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,470
Who wouldn't want a car.

897
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,274
You could build yourself
For the low, low price of $270?

898
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,775
That was the pitch
Behind the king midget.

899
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:38,077
When it popped up for sale
After world war ii.

900
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,946
But measuring 10 feet long
On a good day.

901
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,182
With a one-cylinder
6-horsepower engine,

902
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:44,284
This big idea
Never really caught on.

903
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,718
Just under 5,000 were built.

904
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,489
Before this tiny dynamo
Dropped off the market in 1970.

905
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,458
But as you guys know...

906
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,692
Yeah.

907
00:31:52,694 --> 00:31:54,127
I'm not afraid To think small.

908
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,495
It's actually
A little more spacious.

909
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,097
Than the, messerschmitt
That I had that time.

910
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,233
Test drive time!

911
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,568
Evel knievel's messerschmitt,

912
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,902
Well, that thing
Was pretty small,

913
00:32:02,904 --> 00:32:04,304
Kind of like
A three-wheeled motorcycle.

914
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,939
But, as you know,
I like small things.

915
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,340
Remember that autobianchi?

916
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,680
I especially liked that
They both made me money.

917
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,416
So now it's time for the midget
To step up and do the same.

918
00:32:16,418 --> 00:32:18,117
Chunk a battery in it,
Throw some go-go juice.

919
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,019
Down the carburetor,
And let's see what we got.

920
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,521
Just to see if it fires?

921
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,456
Like they say,
There's a butt for every seat.

922
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:25,859
So there's got to be a buyer out
There for this king midget also.

923
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,994
You figure it all out.
You get it to run and drive.

924
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,462
Can't we make it
A little cooler?

925
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:30,864
No, it's as cool
As it's gonna get.

926
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,098
It's orange and black.

927
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,000
It's like a halloween
King midget thing.

928
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:35,502
Like a halloween candy?

929
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:37,403
Just make it run and drive,
Dude, and then we will sell it.

930
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:38,571
All right. I got you.

931
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:40,874
And you will be amazed
At what I get for that.

932
00:32:44,513 --> 00:32:46,145
All right, that's done.

933
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,514
So, I guess
The engine's not firing.

934
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,116
On this thing right now.

935
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,585
Any time you work
On an exotic car like this,

936
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:54,087
You got to be ready
For the unusual.

937
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:00,827
That's a pretty simple setup.

938
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:03,630
I don't think it's supposed
To be<I> that simple.

939
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,466
Have a feeling this is supposed
To be attached to the motor,

940
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:07,867
Not in the floorboard.

941
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,703
Wow, that was tough.

942
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:13,640
One probably is, it's actually
Too small to fit on the lift.

943
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:14,974
- Good?
- Yeah, try that.

944
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,844
- All right. You're done.
- Yep.

945
00:33:17,846 --> 00:33:20,480
This thing literally
Is just a go kart.

946
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:21,915
With a body on top of it.

947
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:29,055
After getting the starter in,
Now it's just a matter.

948
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,623
Of going through a checklist
Like any car.

949
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,759
That's been sitting around
For a long time.

950
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,894
Once you get fuel,
Air and spark,

951
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:36,362
You should have ignition.

952
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:44,003
Dang, man, this sucker
Fired right up, son.

953
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,339
That's one small step
For gas monkey.

954
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:51,210
And... Well,
One small step for anybody.

955
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:53,613
At least something
Works around here.

956
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,014
Coming up...

957
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,215
definitely orange, Isn't it?

958
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:57,884
Richard hopes
This small package.

959
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,086
Will bring a lot of good things.

960
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:01,421
It's got to be worth
At least $10,000.

961
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,488
Whoa.

962
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,756
Well, that's
A sight for sore eyes.

963
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,292
And the el camino
Build's back in gear.

964
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,894
But for how long?

965
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:08,962
Nothing lines up.

966
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,163
Yeah, that sucks.

967
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,684
We're just throwing
That right in the trash, right?

968
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,286
Hey, get a running start
And just hit your brakes,

969
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,320
See if it will slide off.

970
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,791
Aah, aah, aah!

971
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,561
I'm going in again.

972
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,595
Yes!

973
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,230
That deserves
A celebration, man.

974
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,900
Too bad you don't
Have any more horsepower.

975
00:34:34,638 --> 00:34:37,473
Charles! Get your ass over here.

976
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,510
Thanks for getting me
In trouble, jason.

977
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,602
Well, that's
A sight for sore eyes.

978
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:52,672
So my bank account's
$4,000 lighter.

979
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,440
But at least my paint booth
Is working again.

980
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:55,708
And mike coy can get started.

981
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,910
It's like we're jumping
Railroad tracks.

982
00:34:57,912 --> 00:34:59,278
Aaron bet me
That he could finish.

983
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,379
This el camino in 3 weeks.

984
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:01,881
So he's got a lot of
Catching up to do.

985
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:04,083
As for me, I got to get back
To the business of making money.

986
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,317
And not throwing it away.

987
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,421
There it is.

988
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,122
Bam! King midget.

989
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:11,624
One king little person.

990
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,059
Come on, man.

991
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:14,493
It's definitely orange,
Isn't it?

992
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,195
So I picked up
This king midget the other day,

993
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,231
Along with a bunch of other cars
And a falling-down house.

994
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,232
I stuck it on the 'net.

995
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:21,967
And, a guy gave me a call,

996
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,402
Said he was gonna come over
And check it out.

997
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:25,337
Awesome! Awesome!

998
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,706
My name's greg westfield.

999
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,507
And I'm from rome, texas,
Right now.

1000
00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:31,010
A little town north
Of fort worth, about 25 miles.

1001
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:33,079
So what puts you
In the market for a midget?

1002
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,747
I messed around
Restoring old cars.

1003
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,148
In the past as a hobby.

1004
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,317
And I'd seen these things
As a little kid, you know?

1005
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,219
And I've often thought
About getting one.

1006
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,487
Well, you ever Ridden in one?

1007
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:43,723
- Never.
- Well, let's do it.

1008
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,591
It's powerful, So be careful.

1009
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,959
Seems like he's looking
For something to have.

1010
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:48,294
A little neighborhood fun in.

1011
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:49,895
Now, for me, you know,

1012
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,597
That's maybe something
With 1,000 horsepower.

1013
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,365
That does burnouts
And scares women and children.

1014
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:56,001
But for this guy,
It's king midgets,

1015
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:58,304
Which probably scares women
And children, too.

1016
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,206
It's a little weird.

1017
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,110
Well, you don't got
To worry about too much.

1018
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,046
Pretty much Like a lawn mower.

1019
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:07,913
Yeah, really.

1020
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,115
It's kind of cool,

1021
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:10,549
Driving around a little
Bitty car like that.

1022
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:13,285
Well,
There's some folks that like it.

1023
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,554
Folks are waving at us and
Taking pictures and...

1024
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,959
- pretty cool?
- Yeah, it is.

1025
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,227
Fully restored,
These cars can go.

1026
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:23,262
From $4,000 to $7,000.

1027
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,563
It's a small-dollar car.

1028
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:26,232
But so is most of the stuff
That was in that nest.

1029
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:27,399
This one still needs
A lot of work.

1030
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:29,235
But there's not a lot
Of them out there, so...

1031
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,704
Running, driving,
Doing what it's supposed to do.

1032
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,906
It's got to be worth
At least $10,000.

1033
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:35,207
Whoa.

1034
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,209
I don't know
About that, partner.

1035
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:38,844
There is no way...

1036
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:42,481
No way under the sun
I would pay $10,000.

1037
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,483
I'd be interested
About $2,000, man.

1038
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,418
Come on. It's a running,
Driving car.

1039
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,453
And it's little.

1040
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,054
I'll give you that, It's little.

1041
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,089
You can bring it up
A little bit,

1042
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,290
I'm sure We can make a deal.

1043
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,058
Got any interest at 25?

1044
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,660
I got interest at 35.

1045
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:55,761
How about 28?

1046
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,329
Come on!

1047
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,664
How 'bout $3,000?

1048
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:01,500
Yeah.

1049
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:02,802
I'll take it.
Will do, all right.

1050
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,136
Well, let's go inside
And do some paperwork.

1051
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,237
Okay. And...

1052
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:06,305
I would highly suggest You don't.

1053
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,540
Get on the freeway
With that one.

1054
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:09,041
Okay.

1055
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,409
So another car sold.

1056
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:13,445
Only got, like, 14 or 15 more
To go out of that nest,

1057
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,147
Get those things gone,
Get the house sold.

1058
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,448
I'm on a roll!

1059
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,918
Now, I just need
To win my bet with aaron.

1060
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,753
Thing is, if that happens,
Well, that means.

1061
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,221
He went past his deadline.

1062
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:24,023
And then I'm gonna be pissed.

1063
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,100
Woo-hoo! Lordy.

1064
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:36,602
So we've already
Been working on this paint job.

1065
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:37,670
For over a week.

1066
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,405
I'm loving the color
Aaron picked out,

1067
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,807
But it is black, so we're
Taking it slow and steady.

1068
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,642
On our sanding and buffing.

1069
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:46,011
Since the goal is to get
This thing done in 3 weeks,

1070
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,081
We want everything on our side
Ready to go back onto the car.

1071
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:50,683
The minute it gets
Back from paint.

1072
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,385
Look what I found.
The new bumpers are in.

1073
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,754
Aaron hated all the trim that
Was on the original bumpers.

1074
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,623
So we tracked down
Some reproduction parts.

1075
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,291
We call them repops.

1076
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:00,893
They have a cleaner finish.

1077
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:02,528
But the new ones will
Still have to be cut down.

1078
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,463
To achieve that tucked look
He's after.

1079
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,198
Shiny.
We spent the first few days.

1080
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,133
Experimenting on the ones
That we're ditching.

1081
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:10,069
So, we already know
How we're gonna do it.

1082
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,770
All we need to do now
Is make sure the pieces.

1083
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,740
We're keeping fit like they
Should and get to cutting.

1084
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,308
All right. What's going on here?

1085
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:20,446
What the heck?

1086
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:23,182
Nothing lines up.

1087
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,851
The thing about using repops is,

1088
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:28,621
They're supposed to be
The exact same shape.

1089
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:30,322
And size as the original.

1090
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:32,725
But that doesn't always
Happen in real life.

1091
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,360
- Hey, webster.
- What's up, buddy?

1092
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,594
You know what stinks About...

1093
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:36,695
Not building your parts.

1094
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,197
On the actual parts
You're gonna use?

1095
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,567
I don't think
The angle matches anymore.

1096
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,801
Boy.

1097
00:38:42,803 --> 00:38:44,770
So this is up Too high, right?

1098
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:47,039
The mounting flange is curled
Upwards, is that correct?

1099
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,308
Yeah, I... I mean,
Bolting this thing on the car,

1100
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,542
It ain't even Gonna sit right.

1101
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,177
Yeah, that sucks.

1102
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,046
All that work to
Contour to that angle.

1103
00:38:54,048 --> 00:38:55,281
And now, we have
A totally different angle.

1104
00:38:55,283 --> 00:38:57,149
I got two choices...

1105
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:59,118
Spend a whole bunch of
Extra fabrication time.

1106
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,353
Making the new bumpers
Somehow work.

1107
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,188
Or go with the old bumpers.

1108
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,657
We already cut down
The way we want.

1109
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:05,858
Yeah, but if you
Use the old ones,

1110
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,825
You still got To have to fill in.

1111
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,027
All the holes
Where the trim was.

1112
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,561
And that's gonna eat up
A lot of time, as well.

1113
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:11,697
We're already so far behind,
That could put us even further.

1114
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:12,998
And that's if it works.

1115
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,300
I know what I think
We should do.

1116
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:15,467
But ultimately,
There's only one person.

1117
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:16,568
That's gonna make That decision.

1118
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,671
Jason's right.
I mean, aaron's the one.

1119
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,239
Who made some kind
Of a bet with richard.

1120
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,041
To finish this thing
Fast anyway.

1121
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:24,710
Ultimately, it's his
You-know-what on the line.

1122
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:26,745
So what's the...
Is it the, the...

1123
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:28,514
The mounting location Business?

1124
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:31,483
The repop is a complete
And utter piece of junk.

1125
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:34,453
When you put this on there,
Look at that angle down there.

1126
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,521
- Yeah.
- So...

1127
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:36,789
And that one's flat Over there?

1128
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,958
We would have to completely.

1129
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,727
Try to re-curl
The whole, entire surface.

1130
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,798
On both of them
And then,<I> hope that it's right.

1131
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,602
Whereas, I can just weld up.

1132
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:53,038
The holes in the one
I've already got.

1133
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
I really put myself
Between a rock and a hard place.

1134
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,276
When I said we could get
This project done in 3 weeks.

1135
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,011
I didn't leave myself
Any wiggle room.

1136
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:00,479
For complications like this.

1137
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,449
Whichever way I go, it's gonna
Be a gamble time-wise.

1138
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:05,751
So in situations like this,
You don't want to overthink it.

1139
00:40:05,753 --> 00:40:07,419
You just want to go
With your gut.

1140
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,722
I'm more than happy
To have you finish this one up.

1141
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:12,458
It's a little more welding.
But, man, we know it fits.

1142
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,693
- Yeah, we already know it.
- I'm down. I'm all the way down.

1143
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,161
Other than that, Roll it back up.

1144
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,464
And throw it in the box
And chock this one up to game.

1145
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:19,932
All right.

1146
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,667
At this point, we're gonna
Need luck on our side.

1147
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,968
If we want to finish on time,

1148
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,504
Which means no more
Lightning strikes or bad repops.

1149
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,505
Back to the box.

1150
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,806
The last thing that I want.

1151
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:29,975
Is to be eating crow
Whenever the deadline arrives,

1152
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:32,077
Especially when you consider
Who's dishing it up.

1153
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:38,617
All right!

1154
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,452
Next week, On "Fast n' loud"...

1155
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,755
I think we're gonna need
A bigger hood.

1156
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:44,590
As the push to finish
The el camino.

1157
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:46,258
In record time continues...

1158
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,726
You're making My fender shake.

1159
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:49,361
Golf clap.

1160
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,263
Holy cow. There's a car in here.

1161
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:52,931
Richard tries To dig up a deal.

1162
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:54,600
On a '68 corvette.

1163
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:56,101
I don't even know How to start.

1164
00:40:56,103 --> 00:41:00,105
And spins the gas monkey brand
Into a smoking-hot new venture.

1165
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,308
But when the air finally
Clears...

1166
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,844
That doesn't fit.
The crew finds one problem...

1167
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,346
We got dents.
Are you kidding me?

1168
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:08,680
After another.

1169
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:09,548
Damn it.

1170
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,216
And aaron's bet with richard...

1171
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,620
She's just being difficult.
She will start in a second.

1172
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:17,489
Comes down to one
Final moment of truth.

1173
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,561
What a mess.

1174
