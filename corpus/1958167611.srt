1
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,719
In days of legend,

2
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:54,889
gods walked the Earth

3
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:57,892
and tormented mortals.

4
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:04,264
Athena,
goddess of warfare and wisdom,

5
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,067
had the power
to destroy humanity

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,103
but chose to protect us.

7
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,073
Brave young knights
from across the globe

8
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,442
swore their allegiance to her.

9
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,880
They learned to harness Cosmo,

10
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,281
the power of the stars.

11
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,752
Their fists cracked the heavens

12
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,889
in battles against those
who wished Athena dead.

13
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,062
Over time...

14
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,231
...the gods retreated
and became myths.

15
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,735
But then, 18 years ago,

16
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:45,873
Athena was reborn
as a helpless child.

17
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:51,478
A knight clad in gold armor
gave his life to protect her

18
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,648
as they crashed to Earth.

19
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,920
And that's how I found her,
lying in his arms.

20
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,824
A mortal girl
with the power of a god.

21
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:07,729
Since then, I've been searching
for a new generation of knights

22
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,099
to protect Athena
and the Earth.

23
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:24,946
We fight to protect ourselves.

24
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,687
But we also fight
to protect each other.

25
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,928
There's always something
bigger than you, Seiya.

26
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:44,098
You'll have to fight
to protect that, as well.

27
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,239
You give up?

28
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,341
Never!

29
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,046
Nice try, but not tonight.

30
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,914
Tap out.
No!

31
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,151
You must learn when to quit.
Never!

32
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,557
No, Seiya. Don't!

33
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,961
Promise you won't come out.
I promise.

34
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,774
Hey, kid.

35
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,044
Come on, you're up next.

36
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:08,950
Hey, you win this fight, maybe
you get a shot at me someday.

37
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,685
Hey. Listen to me.

38
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,087
No more of that dancing around,
you understand?

39
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,223
You make it a good show
this time.

40
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,257
Man.

41
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,459
- Fight this time, asshole.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

42
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:21,629
it's time
for the main event.

43
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,164
Introducing first,

44
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,967
the undisputed champion
of the octagon.

45
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,436
Give it up for Jaki The Beast!

46
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,239
Jaki! Jaki!

47
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,741
Jaki! Jaki! Jaki!

48
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,810
Jaki! Jaki!

49
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,478
Jaki! Jaki! Jaki!

50
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:40,047
Jaki! Jaki!

51
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:43,483
And the contender,
who literally danced his way

52
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,953
through his first two fights,

53
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,590
let's hear it
for Street Kid Seiya!

54
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,964
You both know how this works.

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,036
You know the rules.
There are none.

56
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,672
Anything goes until one of you
gives up or blacks out.

57
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,844
If you give up, you're banished
from the octagon.

58
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,344
Understood?

59
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,801
Damn it, fight!

60
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,639
Hey, I said no dancing!

61
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,601
Cassios! Cassios!

62
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,736
What, you think
you can just ignore me?

63
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,938
Okay, calm down, big guy.

64
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,922
Ballet's over, kid.

65
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,221
Cassios wins...

66
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:04,325
every single time!

67
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,966
Cassios! Cassios!

68
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,802
Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!

69
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:17,538
Cassios! Cassios!

70
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,452
Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!

71
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,459
You give up?

72
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah!

73
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,650
You don't know
when to quit, huh?

74
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,821
Yeah, I've heard that before.

75
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:59,340
We're not done here!

76
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,646
This ain't over!

77
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,193
Come outside.

78
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,929
You're cute,
but you're not my type, man.

79
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,104
There's someone outside
that wants to speak with you.

80
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,273
He knows
about your search.

81
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,577
He knows what
you're looking for.

82
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,726
Give me that.

83
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,669
Yeah, it's me.

84
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,575
I think I found
one of your Cosmo guys.

85
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,421
I'm out of here.

86
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,592
Your little show in there

87
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,493
made some people upset.

88
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,228
Look, I'm not looking
for trouble.

89
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,565
You may not be looking,
but you've found it.

90
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,503
In a few moments, Vander Guraad
will be here with her boys.

91
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,237
Who?

92
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,339
My ex-wife.

93
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,940
She controls
this fighting ring.

94
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,876
It's her recruitment operation.

95
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,377
What do you mean?

96
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,513
What does she recruit?

97
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,314
Warriors with special skills,

98
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:49,618
for her private army.

99
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,985
Okay.

100
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,686
I saw what you did
in the ring.

101
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,290
I knew it had to be you,
Seiya.

102
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,961
Who are you?

103
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,964
I'm the only friend you have.

104
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,400
You need to make
a choice, Seiya.

105
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,870
Come with me, or try your luck
against Guraad's warriors.

106
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,378
Lead the way.

107
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:25,719
Come on.

108
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,532
Look what we found.

109
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,577
What are
those guys made of?

110
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,245
You don't want to know.
Keep moving.

111
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,026
Our ride's
around the corner.

112
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,701
Get down!

113
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:31,285
Go!

114
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,022
Meet Mylock, my assistant.

115
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:41,228
Those guys work
for your ex-wife?

116
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,898
Surrender the boy.

117
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,806
Dude, you got to make
better life choices.

118
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,416
What the hell is that thing?

119
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,023
Hope you had a light dinner.

120
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,618
Why are they after me?

121
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,419
They're after warriors
with a strong Cosmo.

122
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,660
Cosmo? Is that a new
martial arts or something?

123
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:46,894
Well, you should know.

124
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,829
You tapped into it
in the octagon.

125
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,065
I didn't tap into anything.
They got the wrong guy.

126
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,300
Oh, would you like us to stop
and let them know?

127
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,980
God!

128
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,502
Hold on tight.

129
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,454
I am not going another step

130
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,956
until you tell me
what's going on.

131
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,358
There'll be time
for that later.

132
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,894
We're still in danger.
You're really...

133
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,368
Okay.

134
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,237
Go to sleep.

135
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,088
Hey. Hey, wake up.

136
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,590
Wake up.

137
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,726
Wake up. Come on.

138
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,128
You need to hide.

139
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,764
No matter what happens,
you stay out of sight.

140
00:15:29,898 --> 00:15:32,266
I have to make sure
these people don't find you.

141
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,802
Promise you won't come out.

142
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,771
Okay. I promise.

143
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,467
Thank you.

144
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,870
For what?

145
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,138
You tapped into your Cosmo.

146
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,776
No, Seiya. Don't!

147
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:19,446
Led me right to your doorstep.

148
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,120
Saved me so much trouble.

149
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:30,991
Let's go!

150
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,327
You can't use it.

151
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,995
Only the Pegasus can.

152
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,997
That's why
you're coming with us.

153
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,357
Relax.

154
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,761
Relax, we're safe now.

155
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,095
Safe?

156
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,063
First, I got attacked
by ninja cyborgs,

157
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:11,933
then I got a spaceship
shooting at me,

158
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,201
and then that freak in a suit
drugs me!

159
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,037
Allow me to rephrase it.

160
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,940
You're safer here
than with Guraad.

161
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,475
She has already captured
many kids like you,

162
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,011
drained them of their Cosmo.

163
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,713
Stop talking nonsense
and tell me what's going on!

164
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,515
- Prepare for landing.
- What?

165
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,884
You might want to buckle up.

166
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,152
No, I want answers now!

167
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,254
Oh, sh...!

168
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,095
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no runway!

169
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,066
I said you might want
to buckle up.

170
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:59,246
You couldn't just tell me
this thing lands vertically?

171
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,822
Let's start afresh, shall we?

172
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:10,290
My name is Alman Kido.

173
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,594
Once upon a time,
I was a businessman.

174
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:15,763
Mylock, let her know
our guest has arrived, please.

175
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:16,965
Yes, sir.

176
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,601
Should I believe you went bust?

177
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,301
I won't hide the fact

178
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:24,038
that I've been quite successful
in my trade,

179
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,908
but the one thing
money can't buy is purpose.

180
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:30,110
So this is where you store
your purpose?

181
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,713
Yes.

182
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:37,484
Tell me, Seiya,
what do you see?

183
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,154
Um, I'm not sure. A...

184
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,257
A whole bunch
of real old stuff, I guess.

185
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,995
I see stories.

186
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,666
Ancient heroes were defined
by their monumental deeds

187
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,569
as much as by
their tragic ends.

188
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:59,641
I always admired the formidable
magnitude of their fate.

189
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,009
I envied it.

190
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,310
I used to think
the ancient lore

191
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,547
held no secret for me, but...

192
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,448
I'm afraid that was my hubris.

193
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,285
What do you know about Athena?

194
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,888
She was a god of war.

195
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,389
And wisdom.

196
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:18,492
What if I told you Athena
had returned in human form

197
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,293
and you are destined

198
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,964
to become one
of her guardian knights?

199
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:25,399
I'd say your therapist
isn't worth his paycheck.

200
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:28,936
Things happen for a reason,
Seiya.

201
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,005
Your Cosmo brought you here.

202
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:34,108
Actually, I was brought here
on a very expensive aircraft,

203
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,511
and now I'm leaving
on my own two feet.

204
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,515
You know the truth
in your heart, Seiya.

205
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,116
Your sister knew it, too.

206
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:52,694
What do you know
about my sister?

207
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:55,295
Ten years ago, Guraad detected

208
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:57,665
a strong Cosmo
at your location.

209
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,900
She thought it was Patricia.

210
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,434
What did she do to her?

211
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:03,671
I don't know,
but your sister gave herself up

212
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,873
so that Guraad
wouldn't find you.

213
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,676
She knew what
you were to become:

214
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,779
a warrior of Athena,
the Pegasus Knight.

215
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,781
The Pegasus Knight?

216
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,783
You're really out of your mind.

217
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,319
Hmm.
That doesn't bode well.

218
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:20,555
This is Sienna.

219
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:23,891
Guraad is after her, too.

220
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,358
Your mission is to protect her.

221
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,227
I can take care of myself.

222
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,030
Why would I ever want
to risk my neck

223
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,865
to protect some rich girl?

224
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:34,068
Because our little Sienna here
is the reincarnation

225
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,770
of the goddess Athena.
Dad.

226
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,172
Darling, don't you have
something for our guest?

227
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,675
Sure, a toilet,
so he can flush himself out.

228
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:43,044
Wow, spoken like a true goddess.

229
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,512
Dad, come on.

230
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:48,281
This moron can't seriously be
the Pegasus Knight.

231
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,784
Go on.

232
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,589
Fine.

233
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,390
You might recognize this, Seiya.

234
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,339
This is Patricia's.

235
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,810
That is the key
to the Pegasus armor.

236
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,980
Without it, you don't stand
a chance against Guraad's army.

237
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,313
I could've handled those guys.

238
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,916
That's not what Mylock said.

239
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,454
So, how's this supposed
to help me find my sister?

240
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,124
You give me a little present
and expect me to help you out?

241
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:32,325
My plan is to trust you
to do what is right.

242
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,928
And what would that be?

243
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:37,297
I suppose you've never heard
of Marin, the Silver Knight.

244
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,133
God, another one
of your old legends?

245
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,334
Marin can teach you
how to reveal

246
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,171
the hidden secret
of the pendant

247
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,240
so you can protect Sienna and
yourself against your enemies

248
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,242
and maybe even help you
find your sister.

249
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,111
Ancient gods,
magic knights.

250
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,613
Do you have any idea
how totally insane you sound?

251
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:56,449
I know, it is a lot
to take in, isn't it?

252
00:21:56,584 --> 00:21:59,486
So, why don't we have breakfast,
take the day off

253
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,690
and, uh, revisit this tomorrow?

254
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,158
Yeah.

255
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:08,563
Well, I am hungry, but, um...

256
00:22:08,696 --> 00:22:10,665
A goddess's fate
is on the line, but sure,

257
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:12,733
let's eat pancakes.

258
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,169
Yeah.

259
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,748
Get off my ring, you scum.

260
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:29,717
Get out of my ring.

261
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,720
You moron.

262
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:35,156
You were supposed
to keep a low profile.

263
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:36,791
And I did.

264
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:38,491
We need to shut
this place down.

265
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,228
You don't get
to decide that.

266
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,296
That's right. I do.

267
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,832
Guraad, come on.

268
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,466
We have a great partnership.

269
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:49,070
Yes, we did.

270
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,072
How's the boy's Cosmo?

271
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,840
It's legit.

272
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,242
Good news.

273
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,409
I've got a new deal for you.

274
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,679
No ring, no deal.

275
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,681
All the better.
Nobody needs a loser

276
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:02,516
who gets his ass kicked
by a scrawny little kid.

277
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,619
He got a lucky break.
Mm.

278
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,888
No man gets lucky twice
with Cassios.

279
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,422
I can beat anyone,
anytime.

280
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,626
Yeah, well,
let's see if that's true.

281
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,945
Something wrong?

282
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,316
I just don't know
how you can breathe

283
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,251
while you're eating like that.

284
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:44,025
Where I come from, you eat as
much as you can, when you can.

285
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,629
You never know where
your next meal's coming from.

286
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,264
Oh.

287
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,534
You wouldn't understand.

288
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,705
Rich girl.

289
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,809
No, I wouldn't.

290
00:24:01,943 --> 00:24:04,278
But I'm sorry
you had to live like that.

291
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,186
Sir, there's an urgent call.

292
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:14,755
Please excuse me.

293
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,167
So, uh...

294
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,338
...how does it feel
to be a goddess?

295
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:36,277
Well, I'm not a goddess yet--

296
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:40,681
just Sienna-- but her Cosmo
is getting stronger by the day,

297
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:43,483
and someday soon,
I will become Athena.

298
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:50,858
Most people would be excited

299
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,694
to have breakfast
with a future goddess.

300
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,930
Hmm.

301
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,165
Guess I'm not
most people, then.

302
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,769
Well, then maybe you should...

303
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:06,173
Maybe I should what?

304
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,549
You should back off.

305
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:16,917
Geez, don't be so sensitive.

306
00:25:19,153 --> 00:25:20,388
Just-just get away
from me, okay?

307
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,023
Okay, I'm sorry if I...
Just get away!

308
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:31,999
Hey.

309
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,536
Dad!

310
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,038
Hey!

311
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:39,073
Are you okay?
Wait!

312
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,311
What's going on?

313
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:47,081
She could
kill you right now.

314
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:50,051
I'm here, sweetheart.
Just relax.

315
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,427
What just happened?

316
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,168
She bears a goddess's Cosmo
in the body of a mortal.

317
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:17,411
When our sensors detect
a potential Cosmo burst,

318
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:21,315
the building automatically
blocks the signal.

319
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:24,785
It's the only way we can keep
Sienna hidden from Guraad.

320
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:27,588
Which is why I am stuck here
like a prisoner.

321
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:34,095
Excuse me.

322
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,097
Wait. Wait, so...

323
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,932
so you really are...

324
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,978
Do you really think this guy
could beat the Pegasus Knight?

325
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:52,313
Perhaps.

326
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,948
If we give him
the prototype.

327
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:08,996
Next candidate?

328
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,503
Giving up already?

329
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,214
What the hell are you made of?

330
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:29,618
Disengage.

331
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:35,122
We ain't done yet.

332
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,497
You made your point, Cassios.

333
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,699
You're a strong man.

334
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,269
But you're just a man.

335
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,543
I have a problem.

336
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,343
You met him in your ring.

337
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,012
The kid?

338
00:27:58,145 --> 00:28:00,181
His power's a liability.

339
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,216
Once he learns to control it,

340
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,185
no living man
will be able to stop him.

341
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,988
What, you think I could,
though, hmm?

342
00:28:08,122 --> 00:28:10,457
You know, with your, uh,
prototype thing?

343
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,360
I have a good ear.

344
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,863
So, what's your price?

345
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,333
That depends.

346
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,834
Can I kill him?

347
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,571
That's kind of the point.

348
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,607
I'll do it for free.

349
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,666
You all right?

350
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,602
I'm better.

351
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:54,835
You?

352
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,672
I-I'm good, I guess.

353
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,842
It's just that I can't believe
you really are a...

354
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,044
A goddess?

355
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,847
I'm never gonna call you that.

356
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:08,882
That's fine with me.

357
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,385
So, how do people usually react

358
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,221
when they learn you're Athena?

359
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:15,523
Varies.

360
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,125
Like, the day after I was born,

361
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,393
someone tried to kill me.

362
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,729
No.

363
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:24,599
Not even you could annoy
someone that much

364
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,233
in just one day.

365
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:27,935
I was told a knight
in gold armor

366
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,671
gave his life to save mine.

367
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,742
When they found him, he was
still holding me in his arms.

368
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,611
Who found you? Alman?

369
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,345
And Guraad.

370
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:43,417
Though she was a little more
into the gold armor.

371
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,319
Used it to develop technology

372
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,756
far beyond anything
you could imagine.

373
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,958
Look at the bright side.

374
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,662
Half your foster family
was great.

375
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,229
When Alman's around you,

376
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:57,231
he almost looks
like a real dad.

377
00:29:57,364 --> 00:29:59,166
Alman is my dad,

378
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,569
and I love him more
than anything in the world.

379
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,306
I know that might be hard
for you to understand,

380
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:07,007
street boy.

381
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,010
I do.

382
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,616
I had someone like that once.

383
00:30:16,116 --> 00:30:17,786
Your sister?

384
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,155
What was she like?

385
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,559
She was kind.

386
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:28,563
And strong.

387
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:31,800
And protected me when
I couldn't protect myself.

388
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,169
And you won't stop
until you find her.

389
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,037
You really don't care
that I've become

390
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,872
your bodyguard, do you?

391
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,509
I will someday become Athena.

392
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,477
I don't have a choice.

393
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:46,146
But that doesn't mean you have
to become the Pegasus Knight.

394
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,981
Alman said it's my destiny.

395
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,685
Nobody's destiny
is written in stone.

396
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,187
Except yours.

397
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,023
Your Cosmo bursts--

398
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,858
do they come with visions?

399
00:30:57,991 --> 00:31:01,161
You have visions, too?
What does it matter?

400
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:06,668
Cosmo visions are a window
into the universe.

401
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:08,703
They can show us things.

402
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,907
So, that Silver Knight
your dad mentioned...

403
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,677
Who, Marin?
Marin.

404
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,379
Do you think, if he could
teach me to control my Cosmo,

405
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:21,014
I could use it
to find my sister?

406
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,517
Maybe.

407
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,452
If that's what you want.

408
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:03,457
He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad.

409
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,028
Won't get another dose.

410
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:12,366
The prototype procedure
has started.

411
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,968
It'll be ready tomorrow.

412
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,738
Any issues?

413
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,706
Just one.

414
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,608
Why Cassios?

415
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,877
Because you failed.

416
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,948
You know, the target
was assisted by Alman Kido.

417
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:30,417
A personal bad penny.

418
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,621
Athena's growing stronger
by the day,

419
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,256
and now she'll have
the Pegasus Knight by her side.

420
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,593
I reckon the boy's got
some Cosmo.

421
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,595
Doesn't mean he's a knight yet.

422
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,597
I don't need cold comfort,
Nero.

423
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,332
I need to know where on Earth
Alman is hiding the girl

424
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,968
so we can neutralize her
before she becomes Athena

425
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:50,605
and destroys the world.

426
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,039
Beats me.

427
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:55,976
But you could always ask
our prisoner.

428
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:00,582
We have a prisoner?

429
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,318
Hey!

430
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:39,888
Hey, wait up.

431
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,321
Yeah?

432
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:44,926
I... I just figured
you could focus more

433
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:47,361
on your training
if you weren't worried about

434
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,731
where your next meal
was coming from.

435
00:33:50,865 --> 00:33:52,199
Thanks.

436
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,475
Thank you.

437
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,811
I guess.
Mm-hmm.

438
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:07,481
Seiya!

439
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,249
Time to go.

440
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,353
See you.

441
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:16,991
Take a seat.

442
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:24,032
Don't get any big ideas.

443
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:26,901
Goddesses don't have
boyfriends.

444
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,903
How many dads
does Sienna have?

445
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:30,538
Buckle up.

446
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,081
Lunch box?

447
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:44,919
That's unusually kind of you.

448
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:48,756
I just thought he might as well
enjoy his last meal,

449
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,224
since Marin's probably
gonna kill him anyway.

450
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,161
Right.

451
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:19,087
S-So, where am I
supposed to go?

452
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:27,095
Okay, just drop me off
up there.

453
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,429
Not how it works.

454
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:49,517
Those who seek the master

455
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,519
must do so on foot.

456
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,350
What the hell am I doing here?

457
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,286
I was wondering the same thing.

458
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:43,771
You must be Marin,
the Silver Knight.

459
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,338
You look surprised.
Yeah.

460
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:48,208
No, I... I mean...

461
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:50,210
No offense,
I thought you'd be a man.

462
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:53,246
No offense taken.
I thought the same of you.

463
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,749
Ouch.

464
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:56,517
So, what's the training
schedule like here?

465
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:58,619
I only train knights.

466
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,223
I'm told
I'm the Pegasus Knight.

467
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:07,494
You're not the first boy
with a pretty necklace

468
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,030
to show up here.

469
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,032
Is there a test I can take
or something?

470
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,605
The Pegasus Knight is brave.

471
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,408
Check.

472
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,243
Humble.

473
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,779
Check.

474
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:28,049
And committed to protecting
Athena with his life.

475
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:30,051
Okay, that's where this, uh,

476
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:32,220
whole situation gets
a little sticky.

477
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,755
You see, I lost my sister...
Hey!

478
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:36,624
I just got up here!

479
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,059
Just...

480
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:41,294
I just got up here.

481
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,333
I'm not going down there.

482
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:19,299
There's nothing
for you here.
Oh!

483
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,401
What are you, like,
a ninja?

484
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,273
Listen, I only want
to find my sister.

485
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,808
Sienna said
you could help.

486
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,143
I knew a knight just like you.

487
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:31,179
He desired power
for his own goals.

488
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,014
Which was?
The Phoenix,

489
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,982
the most powerful
of Athena's knights.

490
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,685
You mean aside from
the Pegasus Knight?

491
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:40,021
Oh, sh...

492
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,056
I'll have Mylock come get you
in the morning.

493
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,724
No. Come on,
I made it this far.

494
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:45,993
And how far is that?

495
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:48,162
Do you even know
how far you need to go?

496
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,131
Just give me one chance.

497
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:51,666
Hmm.

498
00:38:56,436 --> 00:39:01,142
If you can break this rock,
then you can be my student.

499
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,451
Fair enough.

500
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:12,887
Where's the hammer?

501
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,659
Come on, I can't break a rock
with my bare hands.

502
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,962
A knight could.

503
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,831
You can't be serious.

504
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:28,803
You're serious.

505
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,751
Ow!

506
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,554
I told you this was stupid.

507
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:53,794
Your flesh, this rock,
the stars in the sky--

508
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:57,732
all things in the cosmos
are made from the same atoms.

509
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,466
From the moment we are born,

510
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,636
we all hold a Cosmo
within ourselves.

511
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:05,072
A knight can make it explode

512
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:09,877
and shatter the atoms
of any object.

513
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:17,018
How's that supposed
to make any sense?

514
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:22,290
Focus.

515
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,592
Clear your mind.

516
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,895
Feel the Cosmo within you.

517
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:03,965
Seiya!

518
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,170
This is stupid.
It'll never work.

519
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,806
Something clouded your focus
at the last minute.

520
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,608
Figures. Guess I'm not
the Pegasus Knight after all.

521
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:20,014
No, you're not,
but maybe you will be.

522
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,183
Are you ready
to start your training?

523
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,201
It's a good thing
he didn't mind

524
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,969
the permanent changes
to his body.

525
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,171
Well...
What?

526
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:45,806
I might have forgotten
to mention

527
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,675
the permanent part to him.

528
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,721
What the hell is this?

529
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:02,490
What did you do? You...

530
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:05,693
You made me a freaking cyborg.

531
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:17,371
What is that?

532
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:19,206
It's the curse of Athena.

533
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:24,545
The war that awaits us
is unlike any other before.

534
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:28,215
Our enemies are
the gods themselves.

535
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:30,484
We've all made sacrifices.

536
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,322
But what is flesh
in comparison to the power

537
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,526
to crush the immortals?

538
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:44,031
A war with the gods, huh?

539
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:46,501
There's only one person
I want to crush.

540
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,639
Well, that was
a nice little show.

541
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,941
Let's move on.
We have bigger issues at hand.

542
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:55,743
Bigger than his ego?
Your prisoner.

543
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:57,812
He's a tough one.
I can't get him to talk.

544
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:59,080
Any ideas?

545
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:02,083
Have you tried asking nicely?

546
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,925
Let's get a baseline.

547
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,938
Show me what you know.

548
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:26,440
You mean fight you? Now?

549
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,949
You came here to train, yes?

550
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:42,156
Is dancing all you can do?

551
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,020
Shouldn't I have
a weapon or something?

552
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:14,955
Athena's knights
wield no weapon.

553
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,657
That sucks.

554
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:46,820
Okay, I felt that one.

555
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,557
It wasn't a direct hit.

556
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,431
How the hell'd you do that?

557
00:44:57,566 --> 00:44:59,166
You want a weapon?

558
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,235
Your Cosmo
is your weapon.

559
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,103
Focus your energy.

560
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,406
Let it burn inside of you.

561
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,109
Release it all at once
like a shooting star.

562
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:11,111
Felt more like
a meteor shower to me.

563
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:19,720
So, do I get to learn
this meteor fist of yours?

564
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:22,289
You must,
if you want to survive

565
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:24,425
the battles
that await you.

566
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:32,893
Sienna!

567
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:38,799
It's all right.
It's all right.

568
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,467
It's all right.
It's all right.

569
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:42,169
I'm here. It's all right.

570
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,240
I had another vision.

571
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,075
A bad one.

572
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,612
It's okay. It's all gone now.

573
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,813
Dad...

574
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,448
how can you be so sure

575
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,283
I'll grow up
to protect the world?

576
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,687
You are the goddess of wisdom,
remember?

577
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,522
And warfare.

578
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,725
And you're my baby girl.

579
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:06,026
The most loving
and stubborn.

580
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,962
Nothing could stop you
from doing what's right.

581
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:10,998
What did you see?

582
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,968
People burning.

583
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,471
Cities in ruins.

584
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:21,075
Everything... destroyed.

585
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:23,745
We won't let that happen,
will we?

586
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:25,979
You don't understand.
It was Athena.

587
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,817
She was doing it. I...

588
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,884
I was doing it.

589
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:34,455
The visions are just
possibilities.

590
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,693
Dad, I know you'd let
the world burn to keep me safe,

591
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:41,563
but what if
that's not me anymore?

592
00:47:55,476 --> 00:47:58,145
Prove to me you're worthy.
Focus.

593
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,785
Is that all you've got?

594
00:48:06,086 --> 00:48:09,957
Your body is here,
but your mind is elsewhere.

595
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,366
Seiya.

596
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,569
There are so many things
I need to tell you.

597
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:23,303
I'm here to protect you.

598
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:27,307
Now stop my attack.

599
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:36,518
You're failing.

600
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:41,756
Was he a knight, too?

601
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,825
The Pegasus?

602
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:47,461
Mind and body must become one.

603
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,701
A knight's power
comes from within.

604
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:06,246
You give up?

605
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:11,952
If you can't do this,

606
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,688
you'll never be a knight.

607
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:25,966
You give up?

608
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:13,581
How did you say
you ended up here again?

609
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,683
I didn't say,
and it's none of your...

610
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:18,653
Right, I'm not... I'm not
supposed to know. I know.

611
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:23,123
My destiny is bound
to this island.

612
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:25,392
That sounds like
a lonely existence.

613
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,762
But not one without purpose.

614
00:50:27,896 --> 00:50:31,431
You know, I...
I have a purpose, too:

615
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,835
to find my sister.

616
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:37,137
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.

617
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:39,908
I know there is pain
in your past,

618
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,811
but beyond that pain,
there lies your strength.

619
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:48,650
Find it, and the armor
will accept you.

620
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:50,718
This is what your sister
would have wanted.

621
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,388
Get some sleep.

622
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,333
I get it.

623
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,268
You're tough.

624
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,805
You know,

625
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:53,941
someone once taught me
that all men,

626
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:57,277
no matter how tough,

627
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:59,312
have something they fear.

628
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:08,221
I wonder what it is
a big man like you

629
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,158
fears the most.

630
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,044
Who are you?

631
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:37,885
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

632
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,957
Make-make... make it stop.

633
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,762
Make it stop!

634
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:50,430
Make it go away.

635
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:52,432
Now...

636
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:55,937
would you mind telling me
where I can find Alman Kido?

637
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:59,372
Make it stop!

638
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:06,914
This one's bigger
than the last one.

639
00:54:07,048 --> 00:54:08,916
And your Cosmo is stronger.

640
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,753
Now show me
what you've learned.

641
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:40,007
You did it, Seiya.

642
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:42,475
The Pegasus armor is...

643
00:55:56,824 --> 00:55:59,861
- You can't use it.
- Only the Pegasus can.

644
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:01,729
That's why
you're coming with us.

645
00:56:12,773 --> 00:56:14,342
Alman.

646
00:56:15,475 --> 00:56:17,377
He was a part of it.

647
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:21,515
He was there
when Guraad took Patricia.

648
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:28,455
I want off this island.

649
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:31,859
You are not ready.

650
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:34,562
Your training is not over.

651
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,731
It is now.

652
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,310
This whole time, Alman has been
playing me for a fool.

653
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:50,678
You must calm down.

654
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:52,680
If your heart and mind
aren't clear,

655
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,081
the armor will reject you.

656
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:55,683
To hell with the armor!

657
00:57:26,614 --> 00:57:28,683
Seiya.

658
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:30,284
I don't care.

659
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:34,155
You can either kill me now...

660
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:37,959
...or send me back.

661
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:45,933
Let's go. One more round, guys.

662
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,536
Come on.

663
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:57,812
How's it coming along?

664
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:02,183
You want this to work,
I need more time.

665
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:05,786
Be careful, you idiot!

666
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:13,828
Yeah, running out
of sparring partners.

667
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,363
You care to join?

668
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:17,431
Oh, I'm sorry. Busy day.

669
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:18,833
Ah.

670
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,635
Right, right. You're, uh,
playing with your, uh,

671
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:24,071
god-killing toy over here.

672
00:58:24,205 --> 00:58:25,706
Yeah.

673
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:30,011
So much trouble
for one little girl.

674
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:32,413
You know, you ask me,
I'd be more than happy

675
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:34,915
to snap her neck
the old-fashioned way.

676
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:39,253
Any damage to Sienna's body

677
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:42,089
might awaken Athena's Cosmo
within her.

678
00:58:42,223 --> 00:58:45,426
Yeah, I-I don't even know
what that means.

679
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,561
It means you can't dismantle
a nuclear bomb

680
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:49,530
by smashing it with a club.

681
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,233
Uh, I'd sure love to try.

682
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,703
It's not happening.

683
00:58:55,836 --> 00:58:57,671
Make it work.

684
00:59:06,347 --> 00:59:07,516
Alman!

685
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:09,850
I know what you did.

686
00:59:09,984 --> 00:59:11,520
Come face me, you coward.

687
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:13,587
Stand down.

688
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:15,022
I'll handle this.

689
00:59:15,156 --> 00:59:16,357
Seiya, please.

690
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,059
Alman!

691
00:59:18,192 --> 00:59:19,528
Please calm down.

692
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,828
Stand back!

693
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:24,031
You can't hide from me.

694
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:25,599
Seiya.

695
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:27,101
He took Patricia.

696
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,436
He was in on it.

697
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,870
There's more to it than that.

698
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:32,440
No! No, you don't
want to do that.

699
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:34,075
You don't understand.

700
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,743
Come with me.

701
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,745
I'll tell you what really
happened to your sister.

702
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:45,119
Sienna, you know the rules.

703
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:48,889
You must not leave
the mansion...

704
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:51,258
...grounds.

705
01:00:22,723 --> 01:00:25,993
You said you have answers. Hey!

706
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:29,463
Alman was there
when Guraad took Patricia.

707
01:00:29,598 --> 01:00:30,599
He was a part of it.

708
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:32,433
Tell me I'm wrong.

709
01:00:32,567 --> 01:00:34,702
He did it because of me.

710
01:00:38,672 --> 01:00:41,942
Look, when I was younger,
I had no control at all.

711
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,612
One night,
my mom was holding me,

712
01:00:43,744 --> 01:00:45,279
and I had a burst of Cosmo.

713
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:46,780
I don't even know
how it happened.

714
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:48,550
All I remember is
she was holding me

715
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:50,451
and I destroyed her arms.

716
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:52,119
And the next moment,
she was dying,

717
01:00:52,253 --> 01:00:53,721
and it was all my fault.

718
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:56,490
Alman used the power
of the gold armor to save her,

719
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:57,691
but ever since the accident,

720
01:00:57,825 --> 01:00:59,860
Guraad needs Cosmo
to stay alive.

721
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:02,029
So what?
You've got plenty of it.

722
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:04,832
Athena's Cosmo is too powerful.
It would kill her.

723
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:08,302
That's why she sought out
kids like your sister.

724
01:01:08,435 --> 01:01:09,538
What did she do to Pat?

725
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,705
Your sister didn't have
any Cosmo.

726
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,208
Once Guraad figured that out,
she let her go.

727
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,645
But she sent her men
to watch her.

728
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:19,648
Guraad knew Patricia
was hiding something.

729
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,448
Me.

730
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:25,886
That's why she never came back.

731
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,557
Look, I'm sorry, Seiya.
If I knew, I...

732
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:35,496
My mother was never the same
after the incident.

733
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,498
She became convinced

734
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:39,767
that Athena had returned
to this world to end it.

735
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,402
She was gonna kill me,

736
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,404
so my father forced me
into hiding.

737
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:45,706
And left Pat behind.

738
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:48,909
Your sister wasn't
the only one.

739
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:52,279
We left them all behind.

740
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,685
How many kids
did your family take?

741
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:06,827
Our radar picked up
Guraad's signature.

742
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:12,534
So it is happening.

743
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:14,835
We don't stand a chance.

744
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,937
You need to get out of here.

745
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,173
I'll buy you
as much time as I can.

746
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:21,610
I'm not running from a fight.

747
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,744
Find Sienna.

748
01:02:23,877 --> 01:02:25,746
Protect her.

749
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:28,449
You're the only one
I can trust.

750
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:38,259
And, Mylock...

751
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:40,562
You've been a good friend.

752
01:02:42,096 --> 01:02:43,097
Thank you.

753
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:54,275
After Pat was taken,
I-I ran away.

754
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:56,443
All of these years,

755
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:58,279
I've never
stopped looking for her.

756
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:02,684
Turns out she was the one
who was keeping away from me.

757
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,818
Your sister sacrificed herself

758
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:06,820
because she believed
in what you really are.

759
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:08,889
I never asked to be a knight.

760
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,628
I only wanted to be with Pat.

761
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:16,731
You think I wanted any of this?

762
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:22,069
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a guest in my own body.

763
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:27,174
In time, I thought
I'd learn to control it.

764
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:29,243
But you're fighting it.

765
01:03:31,746 --> 01:03:33,648
What if my mother was right?

766
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:39,688
What if I was only born

767
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,889
to bring ruin and misery
into this world?

768
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:44,291
That's not who you are.

769
01:03:47,261 --> 01:03:49,129
How do you know?

770
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:53,233
I guess I just know.

771
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:02,343
I need you to promise me,

772
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:04,178
if things go wrong...

773
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:06,548
if, in the end,
I become a goddess of war

774
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:08,550
and I can't control
my powers...

775
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:14,288
...you will stop me,
at all costs.

776
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:15,657
You don't mean what I...

777
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,726
Just promise me, please.

778
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:23,565
That's my mother.

779
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:29,303
Sienna, wait!
You can't go back!

780
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:30,572
You're the one she's after.

781
01:04:30,705 --> 01:04:31,972
I have to help my father.

782
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:35,844
Okay.

783
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,645
I'm with you.

784
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,346
For now.

785
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:13,848
Shut it! Shut it!

786
01:06:00,795 --> 01:06:02,129
It's clear.

787
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,356
Where's Seiya
and whatever her name is?

788
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:33,360
Sienna is not here, but I am
willing to make a deal.

789
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:35,864
Old man, you are in no position
to be making deals.

790
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,164
Wait outside, Cassios.

791
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,602
Are you serious?
Out!

792
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:49,309
Hey!

793
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:56,483
I really need to get
to this ship.

794
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:13,568
Glad you understand.

795
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:25,178
How do you like
my special bullets?

796
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:32,854
Let's make this easy, shall we?

797
01:07:32,987 --> 01:07:35,088
Just tell me where she is.

798
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:38,526
Straight to business, then.

799
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,762
What'd you expect
after she almost killed me?

800
01:07:40,895 --> 01:07:43,063
That was an accident,
and you know it.

801
01:07:43,196 --> 01:07:44,498
You can't blame Sienna for it.

802
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:45,934
Oh, I never blamed Sienna.

803
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:48,636
I blamed you, Alman,

804
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,805
for leaving me
to make all the hard choices.

805
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:53,908
How is murdering a little girl
even a choice?

806
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:56,878
She's a sword of Damocles
hanging over all of us.

807
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:57,879
She's your daughter!

808
01:07:58,012 --> 01:07:59,714
We never had a daughter!

809
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:03,952
What we had
was an agreement, remember?

810
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,587
That when she'd go
out of control

811
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,755
we'd do whatever
had to be done, together.

812
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:11,124
Sienna was entrusted to me.

813
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,162
I'm responsible for her.

814
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,065
I believe in her.

815
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:20,200
You must believe
in our child, too.

816
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,241
What about all the children
you took to make these?

817
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,911
Hmm?

818
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,213
Weren't you responsible
for them?

819
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,817
It was the only way
to save you.

820
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:38,118
And now I must save
the rest of us from her.

821
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,531
Speaking of the devil.

822
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:58,372
Dad?

823
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:12,820
I didn't want to do this,
but I won't let you hurt her.

824
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:14,154
I know.

825
01:09:14,287 --> 01:09:15,389
Cassios!

826
01:09:24,999 --> 01:09:26,134
Enough.

827
01:09:28,102 --> 01:09:29,269
Get me the girl.

828
01:09:29,403 --> 01:09:31,171
You can do what you want
with the boy.

829
01:09:46,654 --> 01:09:47,555
Seiya!

830
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,861
We need to go!

831
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:59,867
Hey there.
I'm gonna take the girl now.

832
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:02,235
But first, I want you.

833
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:03,571
Let's end this now.

834
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:05,073
No, Seiya, don't.
It's okay.

835
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:08,176
I've got the armor.

836
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:13,748
Anytime now.

837
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:18,351
Sienna, stay back!

838
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:45,780
Things have changed, kid.

839
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:48,116
Face it, you don't have
what it takes.

840
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:59,053
I loved these glasses.

841
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:45,333
Stop! Stop!

842
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,568
You've won.
I'm coming with you.

843
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,369
Let him go.

844
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:53,040
Oh, you're coming with me
anyway.

845
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,563
Rescue on the way, kids.

846
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:35,616
I'm sorry,

847
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:38,019
but I'm taking you down
with me.

848
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:43,925
Go, go, go!

849
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:41,515
No.

850
01:15:12,313 --> 01:15:13,848
It's ready.

851
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:18,052
Give me a minute.

852
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,257
Leave.

853
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:51,185
You must think I'm the worst
mother in the world.

854
01:15:51,318 --> 01:15:54,922
You... you killed Father.

855
01:15:55,056 --> 01:15:56,924
Alman chose his own way

856
01:15:57,058 --> 01:16:00,227
and left me to clean up
his mess, as always.

857
01:16:09,504 --> 01:16:11,238
Athena's Cosmo is too strong.

858
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:13,474
It won't fix you.

859
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:14,742
I know.

860
01:16:16,911 --> 01:16:20,815
Yeah. I gave up on fixing
this body a long time ago.

861
01:16:26,521 --> 01:16:30,257
We both have a bomb
ticking inside,

862
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:33,961
except yours is gonna be
so much louder

863
01:16:34,095 --> 01:16:36,730
if we let it go off.

864
01:16:44,071 --> 01:16:46,207
I know I'm doing
the right thing.

865
01:16:51,412 --> 01:16:53,047
I just wanted you to know

866
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,316
it doesn't make it any easier.

867
01:17:09,497 --> 01:17:11,699
Will it hurt much?

868
01:17:13,434 --> 01:17:15,836
I don't know.

869
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,160
We need to start.

870
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:46,467
Do it.

871
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:35,182
Sienna.

872
01:18:46,327 --> 01:18:48,395
That ain't gonna help,
kiddo.

873
01:18:49,964 --> 01:18:52,399
I let her get taken.

874
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:54,268
I failed.

875
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,738
We all did.

876
01:18:57,871 --> 01:19:00,007
I was supposed to protect her.

877
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,876
Things don't always work out
the way we expect them to.

878
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:14,822
Come on, Seiya.

879
01:19:37,478 --> 01:19:39,413
Marin.

880
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:43,150
You were right about me.

881
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,854
I failed.

882
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,693
I'm not a knight.

883
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:55,597
I couldn't save her.

884
01:19:55,730 --> 01:20:00,635
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.

885
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,343
Seiya, focus.

886
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,979
Who is it that
you're trying to save?

887
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:20,789
Pat.

888
01:20:25,893 --> 01:20:27,294
What does this...

889
01:20:27,428 --> 01:20:30,297
Who are you really
trying to save?

890
01:20:54,656 --> 01:20:57,124
I'm sorry.

891
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:59,159
I'm so sorry.

892
01:21:13,374 --> 01:21:15,209
I know.

893
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:18,245
It's okay.

894
01:21:20,648 --> 01:21:23,016
It wasn't your fault.

895
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,219
Okay.

896
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:45,973
I'll bring her back.

897
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,316
I promise.

898
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:57,719
Okay.

899
01:22:07,662 --> 01:22:10,230
Let's go get Sienna back.

900
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,617
How long will it take?

901
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:31,719
To kill a god?

902
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,454
Good question.

903
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:35,422
We're about to find out.

904
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:04,485
Oh, boy.

905
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:06,487
They got us on radar.

906
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:08,088
What?
Get ready.

907
01:23:08,222 --> 01:23:09,757
For what?

908
01:23:09,891 --> 01:23:12,927
I can get you close,
but I can't land.

909
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,295
Parachute?

910
01:23:15,429 --> 01:23:17,532
Ha!

911
01:23:17,665 --> 01:23:19,667
Who says you're not funny?

912
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:23,036
It's now or never!

913
01:23:25,673 --> 01:23:27,007
Open the doors.

914
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:39,888
Get yourself out of here!

915
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:43,090
Godspeed, kiddo.

916
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:18,620
Out of the way.
Hey!

917
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:21,254
He's mine.

918
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:25,793
Big deal.
You know how to glow.

919
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:28,663
Step aside, Cassios,
if you don't want to get hurt.

920
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:29,864
Hurt?

921
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:34,334
You should've died
when you had the chance.

922
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:53,988
What was it that you said,
Cassios?

923
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:56,958
Right.

924
01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:01,029
Oh, no.

925
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:02,897
Things have changed.

926
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:14,241
Finally, the goddess Athena
reveals herself.

927
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:23,084
You must believe
in our child, too.

928
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:30,158
Stop! Stop the procedure!

929
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:32,192
It'll be over soon.

930
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:33,528
Now!

931
01:26:34,696 --> 01:26:36,296
We are not stopping!

932
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,965
Get out of my way.

933
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,835
Guards!

934
01:26:44,872 --> 01:26:47,207
Your services
are no longer required.

935
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,976
There's no stopping it now.

936
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:52,212
In moments, she'll be
nothing but a memory.

937
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:56,751
Kill him.

938
01:27:59,881 --> 01:28:02,349
You said it yourself, Guraad.

939
01:28:02,482 --> 01:28:04,484
When one goes to war
with the gods,

940
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:06,988
sacrifices must be made.

941
01:28:08,723 --> 01:28:11,626
There must be another way
to protect humanity.

942
01:28:11,759 --> 01:28:14,028
Protect humanity?

943
01:28:14,162 --> 01:28:15,696
Is that what you think
you're doing?

944
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:37,251
Killing Athena was only
half of the battle.

945
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:47,962
This is the other half.

946
01:28:49,897 --> 01:28:51,933
The gold armor.

947
01:29:05,313 --> 01:29:06,814
Can't let you do that.

948
01:29:06,948 --> 01:29:08,983
Thought you were
the only knight in town?

949
01:29:09,116 --> 01:29:10,985
You got to get out of the way.

950
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,727
You're no match
for the Phoenix.

951
01:31:10,371 --> 01:31:12,606
Why do you try so hard?

952
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:15,643
She's not worth it.

953
01:31:15,776 --> 01:31:17,578
She's not even human.

954
01:31:18,713 --> 01:31:20,915
Sienna's not a god of war.

955
01:31:21,048 --> 01:31:22,850
I don't care
what kind of god she is.

956
01:31:22,984 --> 01:31:24,685
Man needs no gods!

957
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:01,155
You don't know when to quit.

958
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:02,690
People keep telling me that.

959
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:45,399
Stop.

960
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:46,667
You fool.

961
01:33:22,169 --> 01:33:23,871
Sienna!

962
01:33:24,004 --> 01:33:25,439
Listen to me!

963
01:33:25,574 --> 01:33:26,907
That's not your friend anymore!

964
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:32,446
She's become
the goddess of war.

965
01:33:32,581 --> 01:33:34,281
We have to stop her!

966
01:34:28,936 --> 01:34:30,505
Seiya...

967
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:32,039
I'm losing control.

968
01:34:33,841 --> 01:34:36,744
I don't think I can
hold her back much longer.

969
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:47,955
You can't save me,
but you can stop Athena.

970
01:34:49,591 --> 01:34:52,026
You must do it now.

971
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,495
At all costs.

972
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:50,652
Sienna.

973
01:35:52,019 --> 01:35:53,254
You're not a goddess of war.

974
01:35:55,122 --> 01:35:58,959
No one's destiny
is written in stone.

975
01:36:01,696 --> 01:36:03,565
Not even yours.

976
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:13,274
The guardian of mankind

977
01:36:13,407 --> 01:36:15,242
or a petulant jerk...

978
01:36:17,911 --> 01:36:21,282
Whatever you choose to be,
I'll never give up on you.

979
01:37:22,577 --> 01:37:23,977
Seiya.

980
01:37:33,822 --> 01:37:35,189
Why? Why?

981
01:37:35,322 --> 01:37:36,490
What was that for?

982
01:37:36,624 --> 01:37:38,459
Who's the petulant jerk?

983
01:37:38,593 --> 01:37:40,127
Oh.

984
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,162
Okay.

985
01:37:43,665 --> 01:37:45,866
Get up.
Okay.

986
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:53,541
Let's get out of here.

987
01:37:55,309 --> 01:37:56,711
Wait.

988
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,609
I'm sorry.

989
01:38:27,742 --> 01:38:29,744
I was wrong about you.

990
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:34,649
I wasn't so sure myself
for a very long time.

991
01:39:20,194 --> 01:39:22,262
You didn't have to do that.

992
01:39:23,932 --> 01:39:25,499
Yes, I did.

993
01:39:44,752 --> 01:39:47,154
Did I do this?

994
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:48,957
Uh-huh.

995
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:53,962
Mylock!

996
01:39:54,094 --> 01:39:55,162
Sienna!

997
01:39:58,365 --> 01:39:59,667
Are you okay?

998
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:01,970
I'm okay.

999
01:40:11,211 --> 01:40:12,847
I'm glad you made it, Seiya.

1000
01:40:14,147 --> 01:40:16,049
You, too.

1001
01:41:01,328 --> 01:41:04,064
So, uh, boss...

1002
01:41:04,197 --> 01:41:05,934
what do we do now?

1003
01:41:07,367 --> 01:41:09,169
Athena's awakening
is a sign

1004
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:12,040
the old gods will soon return
and try to start a war.

1005
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:15,777
We need to gather
all the Knights of the Zodiac

1006
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,444
to stop them.

1007
01:41:20,915 --> 01:41:22,717
I'm at your service...

1008
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:24,619
my lord.

1009
01:41:28,188 --> 01:41:29,791
Stop. Don't call me that.

1010
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:31,926
Oh, whatever you say, princess.

1011
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,629
Ugh, no,
and definitely not that.

1012
01:41:42,402 --> 01:41:43,805
Before we gather
the knights,

1013
01:41:43,938 --> 01:41:45,940
there's something else
we need to do.

1014
01:41:46,074 --> 01:41:47,809
What's that?

1015
01:41:49,877 --> 01:41:51,913
It's time
to find Patricia.

1016
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:58,753
Thank you.

1017
01:41:58,886 --> 01:42:01,321
It's the least
a goddess could do.
