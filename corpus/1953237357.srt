00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,483
You're talking about
when I'm asking the question?

359
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:07,851
Yes.

360
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,488
Um, you're still
soft and scared.

361
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,156
Um, a little less blatant.

362
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:18,094
Um, like... like... like you're
really asking the question.

363
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:21,964
But I'm asking the question
because I'm scared?

364
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:27,403
Right. Um,
but you're not, like,

365
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,209
sitting in your fear.

366
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:36,312
Um, I just mean, like, um,

367
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:40,018
y-your fear, um,
it doesn't hinder you.

368
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:47,056
Like, you fear, yet you're
motivated by your fear.

369
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,191
This is what happened
in the other scene.

370
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,028
We did eight takes
of that, and...

371
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:55,000
I have no idea what the
difference is between any of 'em.

372
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,102
Well, I think it's good
to just take adjustments.

373
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,104
I'm not an actor who minds
taking adjustments,

374
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,509
as long as a director
is actually saying something.

375
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,213
I mean, have you ever
worked with actors before?

376
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:11,981
'Cause it seems like
your thing's bugs.

377
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:15,218
She used to take naked
photos of her boyfriend.

378
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,554
I googled you. I think
they're really beautiful.

379
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,956
[ Peter ] Listen. We really
appreciate the help.

380
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,257
All right, you're gettin' paid.
Why don't you do what she says?

381
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:23,028
[ Ken ]
You're barely covering my gas.

382
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,564
And she's not
telling me to do anything.

383
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,904
[ Sighs ]

384
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,941
I'm sorry about that.

385
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,913
I'm sorry.

386
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:45,989
[ Sighs ]

387
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,292
You all right?

388
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:59,095
Okay, I'm not even
that upset right now.

389
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:02,602
It's just, like...

390
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,203
I'm sorry, Peter.
[ Sighs ]

391
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:10,573
I really didn't want
that to happen.

392
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:13,375
What are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.

393
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,580
That guy just didn't get it.

394
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,517
[ Groans ]

395
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,118
Ugh.
[ Sighs ]

396
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,088
Hey. Hey.

397
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,359
Are you all right?

398
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,962
Is there something else
goin' on?

399
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,964
[ Chuckles ]
Don't be so hard on yourself.

400
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,294
[ Exhales ] Thank you.

401
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:39,530
[ Clattering ]

402
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,264
I heard something.
Did you hear something?

403
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:43,271
I think someone's outside.

404
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:51,108
It's David.

405
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:56,179
Okay. Um, I should...
I should go.

406
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,082
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. It's no trouble.

407
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,250
I don't even know why you're
wasting your time on this.

408
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:03,152
I want to help.
It's, uh...

409
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:07,125
I think you're really someone
who's, uh, worth helping, so...

410
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,065
Okay.

411
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,666
[ Clears Throat ] Hey, brother.

412
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,161
Hey, man.

413
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,461
[ Julie ] Hey.

414
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:48,232
Are you a free set of hands?

415
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,534
Um, yeah.

416
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,669
I'm a terrible cook though.

417
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,705
That's all right. Just chop
this parsley real quick,

418
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,705
and then you can
get back to work.

419
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:58,679
Okay.

420
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,614
Getting into it?

421
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,348
What?

422
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,750
Are you getting
a lot of work done?

423
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Completely.

424
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,257
So much work, yeah.

425
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:18,326
You know, I just realized
I saw your work once.

426
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:22,500
At Miriam's.
You were staying there, I think.

427
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,335
Oh, yeah.
She let me keep my, um,

428
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,371
stuff there during the lawsuit.

429
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:33,409
The lawsuit because your boyfriend
didn't want to be photographed?

430
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,245
Um, well, I guess he felt...

431
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:40,684
that I manipulated him
into posing naked.

432
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,684
Ouch.

433
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,420
Yeah.

434
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,756
It was not awesome, no.

435
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,826
Um, but I learned a lot.

436
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,132
We don't have to
talk about this.

437
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,732
So, you used to live
in New York?

438
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:01,104
I did, yeah.
Where do you live?

439
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,874
I used to live in Hell's Kitchen
with my ex-boyfriend,

440
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:08,847
um, but I'm in Brooklyn now
with roommates.

441
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,180
Two roommates.

442
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,881
What are you, 23?

443
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,350
Yeah.

444
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:18,254
Twenty-three.

445
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,790
I was going to CalArts.

446
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,694
Sort of.

447
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,495
Why sort of?

448
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:30,899
Because my main gig
was being a girlfriend.

449
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,304
To Leroy,
who you will meet tonight.

450
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:37,577
It's not a career
I'd recommend.

451
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,578
It only took me,

452
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,757
I don't know, 20 years
to get my life together.

453
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,163
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

454
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,398
Mmm.

455
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:03,599
All right, flee.
You're free.

456
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,599
Are you sure
you don't need more help?

457
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,268
No, this looks good.

458
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,438
I'll see you at 7:00.

459
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:11,449
Okay.

460
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,517
[ Peter ] When did you find out
you were gluten intolerant?

461
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,452
[ Man ]
I was with, uh, Rod Stewart.

462
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:26,923
He was, like, having a
dinner party or something.

463
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,491
He was talking about, you know,
this whole gluten thing.

464
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,261
I was like, "Well, tell me,
you know, what is gluten?"

465
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,931
'Cause nobody really knows
what gluten...

466
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,931
[ Julie ] I know what it is.

467
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,964
Some... I don't know.

468
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:39,334
I don't know. Okay, I'm
in the bathroom, right?

469
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,335
And this was, like...

470
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,971
Do you even know
who Peter Frampton is?

471
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:45,242
These guys don't even know
who Peter Frampton is.

472
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,276
-You know Peter Frampton. -[ Julie
] I know who Peter Frampton is.

473
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:50,412
Well, he doesn't know. You
never heard of Peter Frampton.

474
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,349
No, I've never
heard of Peter Frampton.

475
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,419
But enough... enough about me.
It's not about me tonight.

476
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,221
To Julie.

477
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,222
For giving me something...

478
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,921
[ Scoffs ]

479
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:03,692
No. For giving me something
like home.

480
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,895
Thank you.

481
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,896
Do you still live in a bus?

482
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,330
Sometimes, dude.

483
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:10,933
But hopefully not again this year.
I'm so sick of the road.

484
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,971
[ Clears Throat ] I'd like to say
thank you to Julie and Peter as well.

485
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,674
- I feel very lucky.
- Oh, it's our pleasure.

486
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:19,909
You're very welcome.

487
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,678
- Julie, you look beautiful.
- Mmm.

488
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,716
No, seriously. I mean, you look
about the same age as our daughter.

489
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,023
- [ Chuckles ]
- I don't, but thank you.

490
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,825
But you got this big guy over here, huh?
Mr. Handsome.

491
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,294
[ Chuckling ]

492
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,395
So, Peter, um,

493
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:44,567
I hear that your mixing board is
where my practice space used to be?

494
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:47,871
- Is that right?
- Well, the room was already soundproofed.

495
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:52,040
- I'm glad someone's getting some use out of it.
- [ Chuckles ]

496
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,976
- Peter just got a huge studio movie.
- You're kidding.

497
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:56,745
So he's gonna be
working down in Hollywood.

498
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:59,915
- Is that right?
- Amazing. That's great, man. That's totally great.

499
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,951
So, Martine,

500
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,919
what do you make?

501
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,957
- What's the inquisition?
- I just want to know. What do you make?

502
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,526
Right now, it's, um...
it's images of bugs.

503
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,731
- Bugs?
- A film, actually.

504
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,469
Peter is helping me
with the sound.

505
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,938
When's your movie come out?

506
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,973
It... It actually
doesn't really come out.

507
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,709
Well, it's gonna be running on
a loop on her first solo show.

508
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,944
A loop?

509
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:32,480
[ Peter ]
Which is at a gallery.

510
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,049
It's a big deal.

511
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,354
I don't know about big, but it's
some kind of deal, I guess.

512
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,388
Come on.
Give him the spiel.

513
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,726
It's so much fun to hear you
talk about it. Come on.

514
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,859
Oh, I don't know.

515
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,030
You've got a great thesis statement.
Leroy would appreciate it.

516
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,100
It's basically, uh,
humans versus nature,

517
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,005
and, uh,
the personal versus the...

518
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,806
sort of intricate complexities
of community.

519
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,642
Listen. At the end of it,
what you take away from it is...

520
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:02,079
What is that e.e. cummings line?

521
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,353
"You can understand a poem
without knowing what it means."

522
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,921
[ Chuckles ] You shouldn't talk
about work around the table anyway.

523
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,793
I learned that the hard way.

524
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:19,369
Uh, excuse me for a second.

525
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,003
So, baby girl,

526
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,803
your mom tells me that, uh,

527
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:31,506
you had a poem accepted
to a literary magazine.
