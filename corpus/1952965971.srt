1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Grandfather, Grandmother,

2
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I enter the sacred circle
to give thanks for all the prayers

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,400
that have been answered
on my path of learning.

4
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,200
I come with the morning star
as my guide

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,800
and the hawk as my protector.

6
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,200
My father, the sachem of our people,
had a vision when I was little.

7
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,400
Like him, I would be a leader
and a warrior one day.

8
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
"But you will become
a different kind of leader," he said.

9
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,000
"Your eyes will see
far beyond our horizon."

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,400
I did not yet understand
his words of wisdom.

11
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,800
I did not know Mother Earth
was so much bigger than our village -

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
even bigger than our hunting grounds.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I only began to learn about these things

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,200
the day after beautiful Nakooma
and I became husband and wife.

15
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,600
We're going ashore. I've spotted a tribe.

16
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,400
- Form a search party!
- Prepare the launch!

17
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Prepare to land!

18
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Trade.

19
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Dermer, tell the sachem we need five
strong men to carry the furs to our ship.

20
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,200
We have enough men of our own,
surely, sir.

21
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Mr. Dermer, this expedition
is under my command.

22
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Please translate Mr. Harding's request.

23
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
Sir.

24
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
Squanto!

25
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
Move it! Move it along!

26
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
You heard the captain!

27
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Prepare to hold cargo!

28
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,200
Come. Come, my friend.
This way.

29
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Down.

30
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,800
Down below. Understand?

31
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,000
Down below.

32
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,400
- Up anchor!
- Up anchor!

33
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,200
Below. Get them below.

34
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Now! Seize them!

35
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Squanto!

36
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Seize them! Seize the Indians!

37
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,600
Canon, fire!

38
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Mark my words:
treat them as friends, Mr. Dermer,

39
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
you'll find an arrow in your back.

40
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Steal from them, Mr. Harding,
and you kill any opportunity

41
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
to trade with them in the future.

42
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm carrying out orders, Mr. Dermer,
orders that come from Sir George,

43
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
who owns this ship and pays our wages.

44
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Excuse me, sir. They still refuse to eat.

45
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,000
They won't eat so long as they're
locked up and treated like animals.

46
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For the last time,
will you let me untie them?

47
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
- And then they'll eat?
- Yes!

48
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, what will they eat, Mr. Dermer?

49
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,400
They might just start with you!

50
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,200
Me na Epenow.

51
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Me na Squanto.

52
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Mene dalusi Thomas.

53
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Be careful.

54
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
- Watch out!
- I'll bloody that savage.

55
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
Don't. Come on. Back!

56
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
You treat them far too well, Mr. Dermer.

57
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,800
Make way! Make way! Stand aside!

58
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
Coming through!

59
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,800
Ah, my ship, my ship!
This is a great day for England,

60
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
a great day
for the Plymouth Shipping Company.

61
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Morning, everybody.
What a beautiful morning it is.

62
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Beautiful morning.

63
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
Good day, Sir George.

64
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Mr. Hunt, Mr. Harding,
returned alive and well, I see.

65
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
We had a very successful voyage,
Sir George.

66
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,200
Well, I expect nothing less
from you gentlemen.

67
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,400
- Lower the chair.
- Well done, Mr. Harding.

68
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
- I think you'll find the discomfort worth it.
- I hope so, I hope so, Harding.

69
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Secure the line! All the way!

70
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,200
That's it. Thank you, boys.

71
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
Thank you, boys.

72
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Thank you, Dermer. Ah, well...

73
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Now tell me, is this
the full extent of our venture?

74
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Anything gold, silver, jewels,
fine armor, swords?

75
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,000
Prepare to be astonished, Sir George.
Bring them topside.

76
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,400
- What are they?
- The noble savage, Sir George.

77
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,000
They're awful. They're horrible.

78
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
Lord, they are wonderful.

79
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
Tell me, what would happen
if I approach them?

80
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, have no fear.
My men will protect you.

81
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
You know, they seem frightened.

82
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,600
They've never seen a place
like this before.

83
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,600
No. You've never seen
anyone like me before, have you?

84
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I am Sir...

85
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
- What is that?
- That's bear fat, Sir George.

86
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,400
How disgusting. Bear fat.

87
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
You speak these people's language,
Dermer.

88
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
- I do, Sir George.
- Tell them who I am!

89
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
I'm the Plymouth Shipping Company.
I own this ship. I own them!

90
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
I don't think they'd understand that, sir,
the idea that one man can own another.

91
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Then they'll have to understand it.
This one needs to be disciplined.

92
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Clean him up.

93
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Then we'll put him on display
in front of the great British public.

94
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
Now take me back!

95
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
for your sporting pleasure,

96
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
the next match has never been seen
on English shores.

97
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
- Bring them in.
- May I present to you,

98
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
by courtesy
of the Plymouth Shipping Company -

99
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,800
of which I am the proprietor -

100
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,000
a wild, wild barbarian
from the New World.

101
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
- Oh, my.
- He's horrid.

102
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,200
You see, Dermer, the riffraff adore him.

103
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,600
Yes! Look! He's cut!

104
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
Squanto the savage!

105
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,200
I'm making a gold mine here, Harding.

106
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
- Gold mine!
- Indeed, Sir George.

107
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
No, no! I want him alive!

108
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Go! Get after them!
Don't let them escape, you fools!

109
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Save me, save me!

110
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Get after him! Go after him!

111
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,600
He's getting away!
Round the back, round the back!

112
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
They lost the scent.
We're heading back.

113
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,000
You men, check the east dock.

114
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,200
- Harding, did you find him?
- Bring him.

115
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,400
- We've captured one of them, Sir George.
- Not that one, you fool. It's Squanto I want.

116
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I'm afraid he's still at large
for the moment.

117
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
This man's injured.
He needs a physician.

118
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,400
You still see them as human beings,
Dermer, that's your problem.

119
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Look, Harding, find him! I don't care
how many men it takes - find Squanto.

120
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Yes, Sir George.

121
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
What is that?

122
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Brother Daniel!

123
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
What is it, Brother Daniel?

124
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,400
He doesn't look like an Englishman.

125
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,800
You see? You see?
We found him on the beach.

126
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,400
He's not dressed like an Englishman.

127
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Careful, brothers. Back!

128
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,000
This is not a part of God's creation.

129
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He's a kind of devil, I suspect.

130
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,800
Devil...

131
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Brother Paul, this is no evil beast.

132
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
Not evil, perhaps,
but a beast nonetheless.

133
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
Nonsense. Only so long as
we treat him like a beast.

134
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,800
What are you suggesting?
That he stay in here and eat with us?

135
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,400
I'm suggesting
we do not judge this fellow.

136
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,600
We show him the kindness
we would show any stranger.

137
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
And we discover who he is.

138
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Come on, sit! Let us say grace.

139
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
- Heavenly Father...
- Heavenly Father...

140
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,600
...we thank thee
for these and all thy mercies...

141
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,600
Brothers! Brothers!
Brothers, come quickly!

142
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
James! Brother Paul! Daniel!

143
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Outside! He's outside!

144
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Let him be, brothers. Let him be.

145
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
We have no hold on him here.

146
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Brother Daniel!

147
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,400
Go, my friend. You are free!

148
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,600
He won't get far.
He's injured. He's weak.

149
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,600
He's the Devil, Brother Paul.
You said so yourself.

150
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Come, brothers.

151
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Come along.

152
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
What's he doing?

153
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,000
A miracle.

154
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,400
Blasphemy! That's not a miracle.

155
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,800
Give way! Make way!

156
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
There's no trace of the savage
to be found.

157
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I'm tired of hearing "No, no, no, no"!
I want to hear "yes" for a change!

158
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
- Do you understand, Mr. Harding?
- Yes.

159
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
A naked Indian
with hair down to the ground

160
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,200
and a necklace
made of shells and feathers

161
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,200
disappears into a civilized city

162
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,400
and all the well-paid and well-trained
military men can't find him?

163
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,600
It's not a needle in the haystack -
it's a haystack!

164
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,400
There are some of us who think
he must have drowned in the great storm.

165
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,400
Well, I don't accept your theory.
I don't like it either.

166
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,000
I want my Indian!

167
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I made promises to London.

168
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,200
Sir George, you have the other savage.
He is very popular with the crowds.

169
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I don't want popular! I want sensational!

170
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,200
Squanto was sensational.
He could sing. He could fight!

171
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,800
The public were clamoring
for him to come.

172
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,800
You know... I'm a businessman.
You know that, don't you?

173
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Oh, yes, yes.

174
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I've invested in that Indian.
I want him back.

175
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Continue the search. I don't care
if you have to go as far as Scotland.

176
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,000
- I want my Squanto! Find him!
- Yes, Sir George.

177
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Maushop.

178
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
Maushop.

179
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,000
Come. Come.

180
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Come here.

181
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Maushop... that. Is that maushop?

182
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,600
Maushop... horse.

183
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,000
- Horse...
- Yes. Let me show you.

184
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,800
Horse. Come.

185
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
You see?

186
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,000
Touch him.
Don't be afraid. Touch him.

187
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,600
Horse. No, no, no.
He won't hurt you.

188
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't be afraid. Touch him.

189
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Maushop... horse.

190
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
We ride the horse.

191
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Here. Let me show you.

192
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,600
See? I'm holding him gently. Gently.

193
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,800
You see?

194
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,600
Come on. You try.

195
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,000
Hold this.

196
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

197
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Kick him. Give him a kick.
Give him a little kick.

198
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,400
A little more. That's it.

199
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
- Horse. Horse.
- Horse.

200
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,000
- Horse.
- He's quite good.

201
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,600
Well, he's not as good as we are, but he's...

202
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,000
There you go.

203
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
- Horse.
- Horse. Yes, you said it.

204
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Horse.

205
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,200
Horse!

206
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Oh, no. Come back!

207
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,200
You see what you get for your trust,
Brother Daniel?

208
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
He's a horse thief!

209
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,000
Brothers! Brothers!

210
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,800
He's coming back!
Brothers! He's coming back!

211
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Horse!

212
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,600
Well done.

213
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,200
You see, Squanto? These are all books.

214
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,000
Book.

215
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,600
- Book.
- Yes.

216
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,800
Horse. Book.

217
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,000
Excellent.

218
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Horse. Book.

219
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,400
I happen to be a man who has read
far too many books.

220
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,200
My head is full of all kinds of nonsense,
but I love books.

221
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I love everything about them.

222
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,800
Let me show you. This is my favorite.

223
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The Odyssey.

224
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Second favorite.

225
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Lightly. Gently, gently.

226
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Yes.

227
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
You see?

228
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Isn't it beautiful?

229
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,600
Nakooma.

230
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,000
Nakooma? This one?

231
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,200
Nakooma.

232
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,400
That is your word for "woman"?

233
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
"Nakooma."
That is his word for "woman."

234
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Let me show you.

235
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
I'm going to teach you my language,
Squanto.

236
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,400
And learn yours if I can.

237
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,000
If I can discover where in this vast world
you've come from,

238
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,200
perhaps I can help you to go home.

239
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
- Nakooma.
- Nakooma.

240
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,200
- Woman.
- Woman.

241
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,400
- Fishing net.
- That's right. Fishing net.

242
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,800
- Brother Timothy.
- Brother Paul? Brother Paul...

243
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What are you wearing on your feet?
Hm?

244
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,200
Oh, uh... footwear.

245
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,800
- Show me this footwear.
- Cheese?

246
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Brother Timothy, I said
show me this footwear!

247
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,600
Squanto made them.
They're extremely comfortable.

248
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,400
Brother Timothy, you did not join
this monastery to be comfortable!

249
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,200
There will be comfort enough
in the life to come.

250
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,400
Yes, Brother Paul.

251
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,600
This is a cloister!

252
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,600
We have secluded ourselves here
to worship,

253
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
not to be distracted by visitors!

254
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Hey, Brother Paul!

255
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,600
Brother Daniel!

256
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,800
We are forgetting our purpose here,
Brother Daniel.

257
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,600
There's nothing sinful in this.

258
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Your pagan friend has disrupted
our quiet life.

259
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,400
It's time he left.

260
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
- Oh, he can't leave.
- Why not?

261
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,000
- He's still recovering from his injuries.
- Oh, indeed.

262
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Well, I'm not a doctor, Brother Daniel,

263
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,400
but it would appear
that he is fully recovered.

264
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,800
But he's learning from us, Brother Paul,
and we are learning from him.

265
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,200
He's beginning to speak
and observe our ways.

266
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,800
Is it not our duty to bring light
into the darkness?

267
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,800
- Do you see this flower?
- Yes.

268
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
It is a pink Mandevilla.

269
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,200
When it blooms,
its petals are like a trumpet.

270
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
But it's not blooming

271
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,000
because it is a gift from our brothers
in a monastery in Spain.

272
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,800
You see? You cannot uproot a flower...

273
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,600
and plant it in a place
where it does not belong!

274
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,000
But Squanto has nowhere to go.
He's lost, and from what he's told me,

275
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I believe he's come
from the New World.

276
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,000
Poppycock! I'll never believe it.

277
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,600
There is no New World.
There is only this world.

278
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,200
And this world, Brother Daniel,
is not round. It is flat!

279
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,000
- Oh, Brother...
- Flat!

280
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,400
Whatever you believe,
Squanto came to our country by ship.

281
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,000
Winter is upon us.
No ships will sail before spring.

282
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Will you deny him shelter, Brother Paul?
Come.

283
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,000
Heavenly Father!

284
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,600
Heavenly Father...

285
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,000
we thank thee
for these and all thy mercies.

286
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Amen.

287
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,400
- What is that word?
- Kissuulk.

288
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,800
It is the name of Squanto's god.

289
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,000
Ah. And what exactly
is the function of this... god?

290
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,800
Squanto, tell us about Kissuulk.

291
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
He is the Creator.

292
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,800
Tell me, Squanto, this mysterious land
that you come from -

293
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,200
you must miss it after all this time.

294
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Yes, Brother Paul.
I miss my family, my people...

295
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
And Nakooma.

296
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Nakooma is the name
of Squanto's bride.

297
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,600
Bride? You are married, Squanto?

298
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,200
Yes, Brother Paul.

299
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,200
Where are the women of your tribe?

300
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,200
We have no women, Squanto.
We have devoted our lives to God.

301
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Your tribe will die with no women.

302
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,000
Squanto, we are not a tribe.

303
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I would never join a tribe
with no women.

304
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,600
We are not a tribe.

305
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,200
I loved Nakooma
when we were children.

306
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,000
I miss her.

307
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,800
I was so fortunate
to be with the brothers,

308
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
who taught me their language,
their ways and values.

309
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,200
But as the seasons passed,
I got restless.

310
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,800
Nakooma was visiting me
in my dreams,

311
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,600
and I saw tears in her eyes.

312
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,000
I had to be with my people again soon,
or my heart would die.

313
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,000
For months we've been searching for him.

314
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,600
He must have drowned, Sir George.
It's the only explanation.

315
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,800
That's a convenient explanation.
If he's dead, I want proof.

316
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
- If not, keep on looking for him.
- Sir George, look at my men.

317
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,800
The weather's been fierce.
They've been frostbitten!

318
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,200
We've lost two horses!

319
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,600
You lose your position if you fail me,
Harding. You hear me?

320
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,600
Your status, your income,
your reputation, your future.

321
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,200
This is Plymouth! I own Plymouth!

322
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,800
Yes, Sir George.

323
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Who are you?

324
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,200
Sir George, my name is William
Bradford, and this is Dr. Samuel Fuller.

325
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,400
- Puritans.
- In search of religious freedom.

326
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
Several of us would like
to book passage on one of your ships.

327
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,400
I have no objection to taking fanatics
like you over the sea,

328
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,200
but I must warn you of one thing,
gentlemen:

329
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,600
I don't deal in shillings, I deal in pounds.

330
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,400
- We have very little, I'm afraid.
- Then you're wasting my valuable time.

331
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,800
- Mr. Dermer.
- Sir.

332
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,400
You're wasting your own time, too,
gentlemen.

333
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,000
The New World is no place
for men of peace.

334
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,800
You won't survive
without military protection.

335
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,200
We have our faith,
and we are resolute in our purpose.

336
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,800
I think you'll need a little more than that,
my friends.

337
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,000
Ah, pork pie!

338
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Why anyone would want to leave
England, I'll never know.

339
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,800
Mr. Dermer, you're a man
of maps and charts.

340
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:15,200
Look at this map. Now, tell me,
where do you think Squanto would hide?

341
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,600
Well, his tribe lived mostly by the ocean,
so I doubt very much he'd go inland.

342
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Not near any city, certainly.
That would only terrify him.

343
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,400
- Mr. Harding!
- Mr. Harding!

344
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,000
You know, you impress me, Dermer.
You seem to understand these people.

345
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,400
You know them.

346
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Well, I do believe, sir,
that if we want to trade with them,

347
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,800
we should at least try to learn
what we can about their culture.

348
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,600
- I can't think of anything more tedious.
- It's practical, Sir George.

349
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,800
And it's good business. Think of
all the opportunities you've missed

350
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,800
by stealing these men from their tribes.

351
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,800
You've made enemies instead of friends.
You can't conduct business with enemies.

352
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,200
But we're stronger than they are.

353
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,000
We can make them do anything
we want them to do.

354
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,000
You watched Squanto fight off
a whole platoon of armed men.

355
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
These are not complacent people, sir.
They're warriors.

356
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Bibougest.

357
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,200
Hawk. Beautiful hawk.

358
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,200
My friend, my protector.
He is always with me.

359
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,200
You've learned my language far better
than I've learned yours, Squanto.

360
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,400
For me there was no choice.
Was there, maushop?

361
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,400
- What is it, Squanto?
- The hawk crossed our path.

362
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
He warns us.

363
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Who are they, Squanto?

364
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,600
Hold up!

365
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,600
Up there! Follow me! Come on!

366
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Go on, Squanto, hide from them.

367
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,400
Faster!

368
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,600
What's happening, Brother Daniel?

369
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,600
- They've come looking for Squanto.
- Perhaps he belongs with the authorities.

370
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,800
- We mustn't tell them he's here.
- Do not ask me to lie, Brother Daniel.

371
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,800
- I will not lie.
- Then do not speak at all.

372
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,200
You there! You're holding property
that doesn't belong to you.

373
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
You, sir, are standing on private ground.

374
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,200
We know he's here, Friar.
Hand him over.

375
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,000
He's owned by
the Plymouth Shipping Company.

376
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
The Plymouth Shipping Company
has no business in this sanctuary.

377
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,600
This sanctuary, under Protestant law,
has no business on English soil!

378
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
Search the place!

379
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,800
You, search the stables!

380
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,600
Tell me where he is!

381
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,800
This is a place of worship!

382
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,200
- There's nobody here...
- Get out of my way!

383
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,800
- This is a private monastery.
- Spare me your lies!

384
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,200
Please don't. I'm telling you the truth -
there's nothing here.

385
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Follow me! Come on!

386
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,800
Tear the place apart!

387
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,000
- Squanto...
- Brother James.

388
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,000
- It's you that they're after. Stay hidden.
- They are hurting you.

389
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,800
It'll be worse for you if they find you,
my friend. Stay back.

390
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,800
All right! What is the purpose of this?
These are our books, our manuscripts!

391
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,400
I'm out of patience
with that bloody Indian!

392
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,400
- Out of my way, monk.
- I will not.

393
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Out of my way!

394
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,200
This is a place of learning.

395
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,600
Then let me teach you a lesson.

396
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,800
Understand? The sooner you cooperate,
the sooner we stop!

397
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,600
We will cooperate.

398
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
Tell me what you want.

399
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,800
You know what we want, Friar.
The beast.

400
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,400
The wild, wild Indian
who lives like a filthy animal!

401
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,000
The savage! Where is he?

402
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,600
Savage? Beast?

403
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,200
Filthy animal?

404
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,800
I swear upon this holy book,

405
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,800
no one like that is here.

406
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,800
Out!

407
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Move out!

408
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,200
You protected me, all of you.

409
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,400
They did this to you.

410
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,600
Your books. Your house.

411
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,000
All this was because of me.

412
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,400
No, Squanto.
It was because there are some people

413
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,600
who bully their way through this world
with cruelty and force.

414
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
You have no weapons to stop them.

415
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,600
That is not how we battle our enemies.

416
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,400
Enemies destroy you!

417
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,800
Our books, our windows, yes.

418
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,800
But our spirits are still intact.

419
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,000
You do not hate the men
who did this to you?

420
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,600
No. We do not hate.

421
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,000
Hatred only leads to more hatred.

422
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,800
Brothers...

423
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Thank you.

424
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,800
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

425
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,400
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.

426
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,000
No, no, no!
Just repeat what he says, will you?

427
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Why doesn't the savage speak?

428
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,200
- I think perhaps it's his dignity, sir.
- Dignity, my foot!

429
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,000
I want an Indian
who can sing, dance, fight...

430
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,200
Like Squanto, the one who got away!

431
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,200
His reputation has been quite special
since his escape from the bear pit, sir.

432
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,600
Has it really?

433
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Tell me, when people talk
about the escape,

434
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,400
am I the object of public ridicule?

435
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,600
Of course not, sir.

436
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,600
Give me that, you thief!

437
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Gold.

438
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,400
Gold.

439
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
In my home, Capoge...

440
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
we have gold everywhere.

441
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,000
Did you hear what he said?
How did he learn to speak like that?

442
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,400
- Did you say "gold"?
- Yes, sir.

443
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,600
Heave!

444
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,600
Ah, Mr. Dermer.

445
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,000
- Sir George, welcome aboard.
- Yes, thank you.

446
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,400
The ship is in fine shape, isn't she, sir?
She'll be ready to sail as planned.

447
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,200
Never been very keen on ships.
Anyway, I'm here on business.

448
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,800
My Indian, Epenow,
says there's gold in his country.

449
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,600
Opinion?

450
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,600
It's a vast and wondrous place, sir.
It's perfectly possible.

451
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,400
Do you think if I let him go with you,
you could lure him or persuade him

452
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,200
to show you where the gold is?

453
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,800
Perhaps - in exchange for his freedom.

454
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,000
I could certainly use his help as well
to trade with his tribe again.

455
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,400
I'm reluctant to let him go

456
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,600
without being certain of being able
to replace him by Squanto.

457
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,800
- I thought you'd located Squanto.
- I've located him, but I haven't caught him.

458
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,200
We need to lure him somehow.

459
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,800
What in our culture
could possibly attract Squanto?

460
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,000
Squanto!

461
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,400
Squant... Squanto!

462
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,600
Squanto! Squanto!

463
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,400
Squanto... A ship! A ship!

464
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
The market... A ship...

465
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,200
We've been to the market and learned of
a ship that's leaving Plymouth in 15 days.

466
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,800
- What ship?
- It's called the Half Moon.

467
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,200
Plymouth. Plymouth is a dangerous
place for you, Squanto.

468
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,800
All we need to do is get him on board.

469
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,600
Daniel, there may not be another ship
for months. Years!

470
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,000
- What on earth is this?
- It's food, Brother Paul.

471
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,200
Food?

472
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,800
- It's as hard as a rock.
- It's been dried.

473
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,800
You plant it in the ground.

474
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,600
A great big thing like this?

475
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,200
I believe it grows into an enormous tree.

476
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,400
Brothers, we haven't even prayed
this evening, and you...

477
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,600
Food is speaking.

478
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,600
Food from the New World speaks, does it?

479
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,600
Well, Squanto,
I doubt if you'll find many...

480
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
English!

481
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,400
Stay back!

482
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,400
English... you have no courage.

483
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,000
Brothers... this is delicious.
It's good.

484
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,600
Have some. Try some now.
It's good. It's really good.

485
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,000
- Really?
- Try it.

486
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,400
It is good.

487
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,800
If such a place of wonder does exist...

488
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,600
your heart must ache to go back to it.

489
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,000
Brother Daniel, you have my permission
to ride to Plymouth.

490
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,800
You must see Squanto safely
to the ship and then return.

491
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,800
Now, you protect these good men
the way you watched over me.

492
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Squanto?

493
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,000
You haven't been fiddling
with this flower, have you?

494
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,400
Well, you look quite a sight
in that sackcloth.

495
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,200
Tell me, does it make you
feel at all like a monk?

496
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,400
I'm still thinking about a woman,
Brother Paul.

497
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Oh. I must tell you something, Squanto.

498
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,200
I confess it's been
a stubborn weakness of mine...

499
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,400
I resist the possibility of other worlds,

500
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,200
other customs, other points of view.

501
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,600
Sometimes I overlook
the goodness in a man

502
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,000
even when it's staring me in the face.

503
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,600
Go in peace. You have my blessing.

504
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Thank you, Brother Paul.

505
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,800
Take this as a gift from my heart.

506
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,800
Mr. Epenow has figured out how
to avoid a whipping, eh, Mr. Harding?

507
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,800
Very liberal of you to give him
his freedom, Sir George.

508
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,400
A business transaction.

509
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,400
This brave that came from the New World
will battle the Ottoman army,

510
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,200
the wildest in the world!

511
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,800
Chief Epenow!

512
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,800
I must warn you though, this
performance is not for the faint of heart.

513
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,000
No, Squanto. No.

514
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,600
You have risked your life for a friend,
Brother Daniel.

515
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,600
Epenow's my friend.
I must do the same.

516
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
The fool!

517
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,200
Oh, no! Not yet, Harding.
He will entertain the audience.

518
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,000
Squanto, the savage!

519
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,000
Squanto! Squanto!

520
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,200
Well, now, Squanto, you were
spectacular this afternoon.

521
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,800
The common people loved you.
The gentry loved you.

522
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,200
You were the talk of the town.

523
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,400
There is indeed a ship leaving
for your homeland.

524
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,600
It leaves Plymouth tomorrow at noon.

525
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,200
Your friend Epenow
will be on board that ship.

526
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,400
You, however, will not.

527
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,000
You can't run away from me, Indian.
I own you now.

528
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,600
You will do whatever I tell you to do.

529
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,800
Obey me and you'll be treated fairly.
Disobey me and you'll be punished.

530
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,200
There is a divine order to life.

531
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,800
First there's God,
followed by the angels, then the king...

532
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Then the rest of us
according to our position in the world.

533
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Your position, Indian,
is lower than the animals.

534
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You're not a human being.
You're livestock.

535
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,400
Harding!

536
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,800
Make very sure you keep him
bound and guarded at all times.

537
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,000
- Of course, Sir George.
- Just like my friend here, Epenow.

538
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,200
Take me home, you good-for-nothing.

539
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,000
You there.

540
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,000
The man you're looking for is not here.

541
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,800
- Do you know where he is?
- Locked away.

542
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,600
- He'll die.
- It has nothing to do with me.

543
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,000
Yes, it has.
The man is a human being.

544
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,600
He needs to go home.

545
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,600
He was brought over from the New World
on a ship like this.

546
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,600
I know.

547
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,800
Have a successful voyage, Dermer.
Do good business for me.

548
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,400
- Bring my ship back safely.
- Aye-aye, Sir George.

549
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,000
- Weigh the anchor!
- Aye-aye, sir.

550
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,400
Let go all bunts! Hoist the sails!

551
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,200
On your feet, savage!

552
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,200
- Take him.
- Get up, you animal.

553
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,600
Come on, you, now.

554
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,200
You. What is your business here?

555
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Get out of my way!

556
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,800
After him, you fools!

557
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,200
Capture the savage! Report to Sir George!

558
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,600
- Sir George! Sir George!
- What is it?

559
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,800
- The Indian has escaped!
- What?

560
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Dermer!

561
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,800
Hard to starboard!

562
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,200
Hard to starboard!

563
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,800
He's getting away! After him!

564
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,400
Head round the other side!

565
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,600
Be certain this is the last time
you make a fool of me, savage!

566
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,000
- Brother Daniel!
- There is no time.

567
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,400
You are a true warrior.

568
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,400
Let's go, maushop.

569
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,800
Bless you, bless you. God bless.

570
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,600
After him!

571
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,800
Sir George, the Half Moon!

572
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,200
The Indian, sir!

573
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,800
Out of the way! Move it!

574
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,800
In the name of the king, out of the way!

575
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,400
No, no, no!

576
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Sir George!

577
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,200
My Indian! Stop that ship!

578
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,800
Stop that ship!

579
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,600
Harding! Harding!

580
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,200
- You're fired! You're fired!
- Yes!

581
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,200
Yes, Sir George.

582
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,400
Save me!

583
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,800
Stop that ship!

584
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:38,000
Brother Daniel!

585
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,000
Thank you!

586
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,000
You won the trust of the English,
Epenow.

587
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,600
The Engli...

588
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
The English are greedy.
I promised them gold.

589
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,600
Where is this gold?

590
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,200
I've learned many things
from the English.

591
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,200
One of them was how to lie.

592
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,800
I learned from them, too.
I found friends among them.

593
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,000
Our friends are the people
that we are going home to.

594
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,800
The Nausets and the Patuxets.

595
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,800
I am loyal to my people. And my family.

596
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,600
And my son.
Pequod will be a great sachem one day.

597
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,200
I too am loyal to my people and family.

598
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,800
And my bride, Nakooma.
But new friends do not threaten my loyalty.

599
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,400
Then you are a fool, Squanto.
The white man is not your friend.

600
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,000
He will only betray you.

601
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,800
My father taught me
to let my heart be my guide.

602
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,200
From the brothers, I learned
to keep my spirit, even in pain.

603
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,600
Epenow's words left me concerned.

604
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,800
Land ho!

605
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,400
Epenow!

606
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,600
I was almost home.
My heart was longing for the moment

607
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,200
when I would hold Nakooma
in my arms again

608
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:03,200
and my family would gather
around the fire to celebrate my return.

609
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,200
But our ship sailed into Nauset Bay,
the place of Epenow's people,

610
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,200
a few days away from my village.

611
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,400
Stow your oars now.
Keep your eyes peeled onshore.

612
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,400
Pequod!

613
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,800
Dada!

614
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,400
Squanto!

615
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,800
I go to rest now.
I leave at dawn for home.

616
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,800
Won't you dance with me?

617
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,600
Dance with me.
How about a kiss, then?

618
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Just a little one. Come on.
Come on!

619
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,400
For God's sakes, man, remember
your manners! You're a guest here.

620
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,800
She's just a bloody savage anyway.

621
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,400
What have you done?

622
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,800
This is not our way!

623
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,600
No, it is not our way!
It is the way of the English!

624
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,600
You welcome them to your village and
now you slaughter them as the enemy?

625
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,200
They came to our land to trade,

626
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,000
then they took us away
and treated us like animals!

627
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,400
You have punished a good man
for other men's cruelty!

628
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,000
I killed them because I am a warrior!

629
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:35,200
- You have forgotten who you are!
- I have not forgotten!

630
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,000
Go back to your village, Squanto...

631
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and see what the English
have brought to your people.

632
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,200
Then judge me for what I have done.

633
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,600
Nakooma!

634
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,800
I began to understand Epenow's rage.

635
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,000
All of my people were dead,

636
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,600
killed by the sickness
brought by the English.

637
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,600
My heart was bleeding.

638
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,000
Nakooma's tears still haunted me.

639
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The playful laughter of my people
still echoed through the village.

640
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:57,200
Now I would wear their ashes
and carry their spirits with me.

641
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,800
I had become a sachem without a tribe.

642
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,800
The English would come again -
I knew that.

643
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,400
And I promised the Great Spirit
to be the warrior

644
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,600
my father had seen in his vision.

645
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,000
Dr. Fuller, Mr. Bradford!

646
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,600
Look at this.

647
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,200
We're safe here.
Protected on all sides.

648
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,600
I suggest we bury our dead
before we settle in.

649
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,800
I still feel uneasy about this decision.
This is someone else's home.

650
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,800
God has guided us here.
This will be our home.

651
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
- But what if they come back?
- They will be met with resistance.

652
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
That is what you pay me for.

653
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,600
Warwick, take one man
and search the surrounding forest.

654
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,600
Captain Fuller!

655
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,200
Man the barricades!

656
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
You two, come with me.

657
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:54,400
Carver, make sure the women
and children are secure.

658
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,000
I want every man of yours
armed and ready.

659
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Mr. Bradford, could you
bring the rosewater, please?

660
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,800
We should try to make contact
with these people first.

661
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,600
We must show them we mean no harm.

662
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,600
I will not allow my men
to be used as target practice.

663
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,200
If we do not show strength now,
then all is lost.

664
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,400
Mr. Standish is right. We've lived
too long under fear and persecution.

665
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,600
I say we fight for what should be ours.

666
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,600
Think of what you're saying, Mr. Carver.

667
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,600
Are we to be the same
as those who persecuted us in England?

668
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,400
- Should we commit murder?
- Bradford, I am preventing murder.

669
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,000
I shall do what is necessary.

670
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,800
I want all men to enforce the barricade!

671
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,800
Squanto!

672
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
What has to be done.

673
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,200
What my father would have done.

674
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,000
- Shoot him.
- No, wait.

675
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,400
- Shoot him.
- Mr. Carver, he's unarmed.

676
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,800
Enough!

677
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,000
Too much blood.

678
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,400
Too much blood on this land.
Too many tears.

679
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,000
It's a trick.

680
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,200
All of my people have died here.

681
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,200
And all of your people will die too.

682
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,600
Put down your weapons!

683
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
All of you!

684
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,400
Pequod!

685
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,800
No!

686
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,000
No!

687
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,600
Now kill me! Kill me!

688
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,800
And you'll kill them and they'll kill you.

689
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,400
And more of us will die!

690
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And we will kill each other
until there's nothing left!

691
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,600
Nothing but ashes and bones!

692
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,000
We must end this!

693
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Here! Now!

694
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,600
I'm a doctor. I can help.

695
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,400
I can help! Please, we must take him
inside to stop the bleeding.

696
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,200
If he dies, you all die.

697
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,200
The ball is out.

698
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:48,200
But his wound is inflamed
and I fear he's growing more feverish.

699
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
This.

700
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,400
How is he now?

701
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,600
He's now in the hands of the Creator.
We must wait.

702
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,600
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

703
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,400
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

704
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,800
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

705
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,800
as we forgive those
who trespass against us;

706
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,800
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

707
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
for thine is kingdom and the power
and the glory forever and ever.

708
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,000
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

709
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,800
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

710
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,200
Give us this day our daily...

711
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,800
Dada.

712
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,600
The Creator has given my son Pequod
his life back today.

713
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,200
We will leave this village now.

714
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,200
Thank you, my friend.

715
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,400
And so began a time of harmony

716
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,400
between people whose ways
were so different from one another.

717
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,400
We who knew the land taught
those who had come from far away

718
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,600
how to plant and to hunt.

719
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:06,000
At harvest we came together
to give thanks.

720
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:18,400
Brothers and sisters, new friends,
please, let us rise and pray.

721
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,400
Heavenly Father, we thank thee
for this bountiful harvest

722
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,000
and for bringing so many of us together
on this joyous day.

723
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
We humbly ask thee for thy blessing.

724
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,200
Amen.

725
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,200
Please, everyone, eat.

726
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,400
My friends!

727
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,000
In the world there are many people...

728
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:28,200
with all kinds of customs and beliefs...

729
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,800
speaking many languages.

730
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,800
But there is only one moon, one sun...

731
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,200
one Mother Earth.

732
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,200
And there is only one tribe.

733
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,200
Let's live together in peace!
