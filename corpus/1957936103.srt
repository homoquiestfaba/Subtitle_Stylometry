1
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,839
Lucy?

2
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,215
Hi, how are you?

3
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>Hi, Dr. Gordon. Uh...</i>

4
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>this is so weird.
You're there, I'm here.</i>

5
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,683
<i>How do we do this?
How do we start?</i>

6
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,977
Just like we always do
when you were in my office,

7
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,898
except you hit the camera on
the bottom left of your screen.

8
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,233
<i>Do you... do you have to see me?</i>

9
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,236
Well, since we haven't
talked in a while,

10
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,529
I think it's important that, uh,

11
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,575
I have some
visual contact with you.

12
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:25,246
We can go to normal
phone sessions in the future.

13
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,998
Patients have been
worried about their hair

14
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,791
looking different.

15
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,338
<i>No, it's not that.
I look great. I'm so rested.</i>

16
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,883
Glad you're sleeping.

17
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:42,347
<i>- Thank you!</i>
- So... let's turn the camera on.

18
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,308
<i>Fortunately, it has
also given me some anxiety,</i>

19
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:52,231
<i>like with this call. Like,
what if your house is... ugly.</i>

20
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,236
<i>That would be very
triggering for me.</i>

21
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,238
- You've seen my office.
<i>- I have,</i>

22
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,365
<i>and I have been wanting
to talk to you about that.</i>

23
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,368
<i>I feel like the color of
the walls and the couch</i>

24
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:05,245
<i>are fighting each other.</i>

25
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,167
Why don't we, uh...

26
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,837
Why don't we...

27
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,464
take a breath?

28
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,383
Close your eyes,

29
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,052
picture an endless
body of water.

30
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,639
Put your mouse on
the video prompt,

31
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,977
and click when you're ready.

32
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,276
How are you?

33
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,987
<i>Uh... No. How are you?</i>

34
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,406
With COVID? I'm fine.

35
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,074
<i>No, with being Black. Er...</i>

36
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,827
<i>Sorry, with, um...</i>

37
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:50,414
<i>With being African-American.
With the Black Lives Matter.</i>

38
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,500
Well, it's a...
It's painful time.

39
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- But it's always been painful.

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,298
I mean,
these murders aren't new.

41
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,258
But the public concern is.

42
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,427
Our pain is
becoming a shared pain.

43
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:09,476
There's a sense of relief,
you know, in that, and, um...

44
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,355
a sense of hope that
maybe there'll be

45
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,232
some real and lasting change.

46
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,861
<i>I take responsibility,</i>

47
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,823
<i>and I am so sorry
that racism even exists.</i>

48
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,451
<i>- Can I say that?</i>
- Yes, of course.

49
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,873
<i>It's disgusting,
and I feel guilty.</i>

50
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,042
<i>I... I actually do.
I really do.</i>

51
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,461
<i>And, um...</i>

52
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,463
<i>What was... What can I do?</i>

53
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,466
Well, you could
commit to learning about

54
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,885
the true history of racism.

55
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,554
- That's a start.
<i>- I did. Yeah, I've done that.</i>

56
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,432
<i>I've, um... I've been
reading James Baldwin,</i>

57
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,937
<i>and I've watched that, um...</i>

58
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,691
<i>the documentary on... Er, what...</i>

59
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,568
<i>Frederick Douglass.
So good.</i>

60
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,406
- That's a great beginning.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

61
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,242
- Frederick Douglass is...
<i>- Should we start now?</i>

62
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,121
Sure. Yes.
Yes, of course, of course.

63
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,500
So, how are you?

64
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>Well...</i>

65
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,716
<i>I have found this pandemic
very validating,</i>

66
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:29,222
<i>which has been incredible
for my self-esteem.</i>

67
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>Um...</i>

68
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,059
<i>Yeah.</i>

69
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,729
Tell me about that.

70
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,357
<i>This is my time.</i>

71
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,194
Can you elaborate?

72
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,488
<i>I'm right. Finally.</i>

73
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,743
<i>Well, I have always
been right. Um...</i>

74
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,496
<i>The world is full
of dangerous germs,</i>

75
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,915
<i>and if we get near them, we die.</i>

76
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,003
<i>And... that is so liberating.</i>

77
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,505
There's a lot to...

78
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,091
A lot to unpack
in what you just said.

79
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,676
So what I'm hearing is,

80
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,430
in a way, the world is
walking in your shoes now.

81
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>Yes! Yes. Exactly.</i>

82
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
<i>I mean, I've been washing
my hands 30 times a day</i>

83
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:19,230
<i>and socially distancing
my entire life.</i>

84
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,275
<i>Friends are
calling me for advice.</i>

85
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,737
It sounds as if
there's a feeling of relief,

86
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,178
as well as a sense of
belonging to your own life.

87
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,701
- That's a very powerful, Lucy.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

88
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,536
<i>I feel like
I could start dating.</i>

89
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:37,289
<i>Um, I've always
avoided touching people,</i>

90
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,230
<i>even people I want to touch,</i>

91
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,587
<i>and now that is
socially acceptable.</i>

92
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,922
So, the reality of COVID,

93
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:50,053
along with your OCD, has helped
you manage your response to it.

94
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,726
<i>Is that a dog?
Have you got a dog?</i>

95
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,604
- Um...
<i>- I don't like dogs. I...</i>

96
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,711
- Dr. Gordon, have you got a dog?
- No. Uh...

97
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>They lick your butt
and lick your face.</i>

98
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,507
- No, no, no, no... I... No...
<i>- And they have worms. And Parvo.</i>

99
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:09,280
- I don't have any pets, but...
<i>- And they get ear infections.</i>

100
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,242
For the record, humans can't
catch any diseases from a dog.

101
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,327
<i>Can't you get COVID from a dog?</i>

102
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,749
There have been no confirmed
cases of pets carrying COVID,

103
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,294
according to the American
Veterinary Medical Association.

104
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,132
<i>Right. No confirmed cases.</i>

105
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>What about the cases
that haven't been confirmed?</i>

106
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,473
It's on their website.

107
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,224
<i>This is my worst fear,</i>

108
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:42,063
<i>experts giving me advice
that I can't trust.</i>

109
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,899
Hmm...

110
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,943
Let's talk about that.
Tell me about that.

111
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,239
<i>The only voice I can trust
is the one inside me, and...</i>

112
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,119
<i>for the first time, ever...</i>

113
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,373
<i>it's not broken.</i>

114
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,879
Let's stay with that
for a moment.

115
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,381
This feeling,

116
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,343
that the world has...

117
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,511
finally caught up
to who you are,

118
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,181
and it's helping you
find your place.

119
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,557
<i>Yeah.</i>

120
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,232
<i>- Please, can you make it stop?</i>
- I, uh...

121
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,817
<i>I'm gonna lose my voice!
Can you please make it stop?</i>

122
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,944
I can't... make it stop.
But what if we, um,

123
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
do some deep breathing together?

124
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,034
We... we think of the barking
as a calming sound.

125
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,225
All right?
Let's... let's just change

126
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,123
our emotional frame
of reference to it.

127
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,169
Okay?
And breathe in, one.

128
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,594
In.

129
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,432
And out.

130
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,185
Yes.

131
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,728
Good job, Lucy. Good job.

132
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,364
"Dear Chinese chicken salad,
dressing on the side,

133
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,619

This is not...

No. Why?
Why, why, why, why me?

157
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,871
Why me? This is really
pushing all my buttons.

Stay right there.

Stay right there.

166
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,335
Hi... Nala.

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,674
I'm Beth.

168
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,680
Do you bite?

'Cause that would be
a deal breaker.

I've never allowed
myself to have one.

Although everyone
I've ever known has

174
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:45,283
highly recommended my making
this kind of commitment.

175
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,705
I have work.

176
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:55,418
I have patients that
really need me right now.

177
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,462
Could you please
keep it down for a moment?

178
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:00,965
That's my next patient,
and he can be kind of demanding.

179
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,307
We don't know when
it's gonna go back.

180
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,519
My job is to help you feel safe
with the uncertainty of that.

181
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,440
No, it's... it's
my neighbor's dog.

182
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,068
Nala?

183
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,653
Shh.

184
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,739
Of course. Of course you
have my... my full attention.

185
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,408
Yes, Donald.

186
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,536
Yeah. You... you're going into...

187
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,414
you're going into panic.

188
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,001
Let's... get you
back in focus, okay?

189
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,255
I want... Let's use your senses.

190
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:46,678
Okay. All right.
Tell me one thing you can touch.

191
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,888
Your phone.

192
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,766
Right, okay. Yes.

193
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:57,022
And one thing you can smell.

194
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,318
Oh, okay.

195
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,113
And one thing you can taste.

196
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:10,118
Do you have a... do you
have some water there?

197
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,828
Okay. Take a sip.

198
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,334
Good, Donald.

199
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,338
All right.
Okay.

200
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,424
Now breathe in.

201
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,426
Hi, Nala.

202
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,935
That was... one.

203
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,316
That was two.

204
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,072
That was three.

205
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,824
This is... I can't do this.
I can't.

206
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,371
Yeah... I understand.
Karen, yes.

207
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,124
FaceTime her 15 to 20 times
in a row, short calls.

208
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,935
The more you're exposed to
the fact that she's healthy

209
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,212
and wants to engage
will help open

210
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:05,006
new neural pathways
for the both of you.

211
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:26,194
I don't have room
for this in my life.

212
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,363
Yes, I live alone.

213
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,951
I work from... I work from home,

214
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,663
but I can't split my focus.
I don't have time.

215
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,166
Hawthorne Shelters reopened.

216
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:46,131
Wait, it says here Hawthorne
is a high-kill shelter.

217
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,344
How many pounds is she? Um...

218
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,304
Well,
she's not gonna fit in a purse,

219
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,015
if that's what you mean.

220
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,435
She resembles a, uh...

221
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,689
a Pitbull with short legs.

222
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,776
Big dogs get put down first?

223
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,238
Why? That's just wrong.

224
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,325
What if I donate money for her
to stay until she's adopted?

225
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,661
Who is "they"?

226
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,165
It's ultimately up to me.

227
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,210
Why does everyone think
I have the answer?

228
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:28,173
Why is it always up to me
to figure out what's right?

229
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,053
Hello?

230
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,309
Hi, Nala.

231
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,436
Can you sit?

232
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,190
Not bad.

233
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,941
Can you fetch?

234
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,568
Good job!

235
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,696
Right here!
Oh, good job!

236
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,282
It's not your germs that worry
me, because people with animals

237
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:58,453
tend to have stronger immune
systems for a host of reasons.

238
00:17:58,454 --> 00:18:01,205
Happiness quotient,

239
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,748
exercise level.

240
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,043
Being exposed to more germs

241
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,837
helps the body
more easily fight them off.

242
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,637
I know what it's like
to be pre-judged

243
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,974
for what you look like,
to provoke a response

244
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:24,270
when you're doing nothing,
because people live in fear.

245
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:28,733
They have these prejudices
they don't even understand.

246
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,195
The hardest part for
my clients with OCD is...

247
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,240
once they've mastered
the fear of one thing,

248
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:38,451
their fear often
transfers to something else.

249
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,414
I feel their pain,

250
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:48,670
'cause it ties into
my own OCD and panic issues.

251
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:52,215
But of course
I can't tell them that.

252
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,011
I can't tell them
anything that personal.

253
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,262
You know?

254
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,557
So COVID has been easy for me.

255
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,145
It's been a relief
not to go out.

256
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,899
My whole life has been about
keeping a... a safe distance

257
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,902
from people, because...

258
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,282
I've been easily misunderstood,
you know?

259
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,538
Because,
to be really honest, Nala...

260
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,584
I'm afraid if
they knew all of me...

261
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,551
they might not love me.

262
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,903
I think we're making progress.

263
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,996
The fuck is
she FaceTiming me for?

264
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,706
Shit.

265
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,508
Fuckin' cheeky.

266
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,724
Okay.

267
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,482
All right.

268
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,447
- Hey!
- Hey.

269
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,826
- You did your hair?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,432
Why?
Where the fuck you going?

271
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,871
Oh, shut up.
And why the hell

272
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:52,664
are you wearing
a hat in the house?

273
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,624
I was on a call, I told you.

274
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,357
Anyway, what's up?

275
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm trying to find the strength
not to kill my husband,

276
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,382
but it's... You go.
What's up with you? How are you?

277
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,177
I'm all right. You know,
just trying to stay busy.

278
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,389
Been writing, exercising.
Have you been exercising?

279
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,598
Really?

280
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:12,976
Gigi, come on!

281
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,271
I'm sorry.
I... I know you don't exercise,

282
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:19,837
so I thought I would ask.
You know, maybe you're trying to

283
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:22,485
take advantage of the situation
and be healthy.

284
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,279
Oh, shut up.

285
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,364
- You shut up.
- Oh, look at this shit.

286
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,784
The numbers just went up again.

287
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,245
I know, I saw the news
this morning. It's horrible.

288
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,123
God, I'm telling you, this shit
is scaring the shit out of me.

289
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,542
The end is coming,
and my husband,

290
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,711
he's over there watching
that stupid news channel,

291
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,314
and he's still convinced
that it's a hoax.

292
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,922
And every day he's
in my ear talking shit...

293
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,842
- Well, it's not a hoax.
- I know that. Okay?

294
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,261
Please don't stress me out.
Please.

295
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:50,013
Coco, I'm telling you right now,

296
00:23:50,014 --> 00:23:52,849
God's wrath is
coming down upon us. Okay?

297
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,830
Just like the Bible says,
there will be fires,

298
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,103
- there will be floods...
- And world destruction,

299
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,914
and the world's going to end.
Gigi, they've been preaching

300
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,024
the same shit during
every world crisis

301
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,693
since the Spanish Flu to Y2K,
and now this.

302
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,195
You wanna let me finish a
sentence, maybe?

303
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:06,863
Because that's...
You're really annoying.

304
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,637
I'm not trying...
Okay, you know what? I'm sorry.

305
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:11,410
I've been cooped up
in this house alone

306
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:14,621
for a week and a half
with no one to talk to, so...

307
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,206
- cut me some slack.
- Well, I thought you said

308
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,853
you were just on the phone
with someone.

309
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:20,752
- Well, you know what I mean.
- Well, I called you.

310
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,587
You know that?
I called you yesterday,

311
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,339
I called day before yesterday,
and you didn't call back.

312
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,903
Please don't tell me
it's because you were busy,

313
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,842
- 'cause I know your ass wasn't.
- I was.

314
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:30,887
Yeah, what? Doing what?
Coloring in those grays?

315
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,353
I just did mine this morning.

316
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,606
Uh, did you get Botox?

317
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:43,900
No.

318
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:50,531
Oh, wow! Wow.

319
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:54,327
You... Who the hell's looking at
your big-ass forehead right now?

320
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,954
- Gigi!
- For your husband,

321
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:59,249
who's not even there, and me
and maybe a couple other girls?

322
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,501
You know, the world is coming
to an end and you're worried

323
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,753
- about your forehead?
- Yep.

324
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,629
- Perfect.
- And you need to get yourself

325
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,090
some botox too
whenever this shit is over.

326
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,093
And you need to take care of
that mustache that's growing,

327
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,263
it's hideous!

328
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,305
Uh...

329
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:18,434
you know it's 11 o'clock
in the morning?

330
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:20,478
And?

331
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,313
I bet you a lot of other people
are pouring right now too.

332
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:25,191
This shit is too crazy
not to get drunk before noon.

333
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,235
You really need
to start praying.

334
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,674
I pray every day...

335
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,239
as I thank the Lord
for these fermented grapes.

336
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,240
Oh, Coco.

337
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:35,492
Oh, Gigi, relax.

338
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:39,372
Jesus drank wine too during
a time of crisis, so it's okay.

339
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,584
- What?
- The Last Supper?

340
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,086
How the hell do you think
he got up on that cross?

341
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,755
Coco! Blasphemy!

342
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:49,445
That's at least a week in hell!

343
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:51,968
And he should've
smoked a fatty, too.

344
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,639
Speaking of...

345
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,352
Mm-mm-mm.
Look at that.

346
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,436
Yep!

347
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:07,359
- Seriously, Coco?
- It's just weed.

348
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,111
- God's own green grass.
- At least a month in hell.

349
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,738
A month.

350
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,573
Oh, shit. Fuck. I didn't
even get... He's back now,

351
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,159
and I didn't even get
to tell you why I called you.

352
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,329
Girl, all of a sudden,
he wants to start fucking again.

353
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,622
<i>No joda.</i>

354
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,041
You poor thing.

355
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,417
I know! But you know what?

356
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,503
At least it only lasts
five or ten minutes tops.

357
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,880
<i>! Cállate!</i>

358
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>Cállate.</i>Don't say anything.

359
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,053
You're so lucky that you still
like having sex with John.

360
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,472
I mean, it's... I know it's hard
not having him there with you,

361
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:39,307
but girl, at least
he's not driving you crazy

362
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,975
like every other woman's husband
is doing right now.

363
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,727
I'm... Okay, gotta go.

364
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:44,229
All right, he's here.
I gotta go.

365
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,856
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- Okay.

366
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,775
Bye.

367
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:35,989
Shit.

368
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:43,267
Oh, my God.
You look like a hot mess

369
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:46,583
- and I'm a fat fuckin' pig.
- Coco, I really... I didn't... I...

370
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,085
Shut the fuck up.
I... I didn't call for this.

371
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,256
What's wrong?

372
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,468
Oh, God. I just...
I started drinking again.

373
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:59,054
Why?

374
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,515
Because, I... That's...
All we do is fight.

375
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,309
That's all that happens, is...
All we do is fight.

376
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,311
- So what else is new?
- You know, I can...

377
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,146
I'm having a fucking
nervous breakdown

378
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:10,940
right now and I could do
without your... your sarcasm.

379
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,032
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

380
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:23,912
You okay?

381
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:28,999
No, I hit him.

382
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,380
Who, Julio?
<i>No joda.</i>

383
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,987
I told him, I couldn't take it
anymore, and if he continued

384
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,760
to watch that Tucker Carlson and
if he didn't change the channel,

385
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,929
I was gonna beat the shit
out of him, and he laughed,

386
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,390
so I hit him. And, you know,
there was blood everywhere,

387
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:46,142
and... I mean, thank God
that the swelling went down.

388
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,104
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God, I know this is cra...

389
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:50,605
You know what?
I'm gonna call you tomorrow,

390
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,357
because I can't
even take it today.

391
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:54,401
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gigi.

392
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:57,070
I'm drunk too.
I'm sorry. Don't hang up.

393
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,618
So what you get drunk on, Henny?

394
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:09,498
No, you ass!
It wasn't Henny, it was gin.

395
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,460
- And I'm going to hell.
- No, you're not.

396
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,254
Because there is no hell.

397
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,505
Okay? You die and that's it.

398
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:19,926
Jail? Maybe.
Especially with your temper.

399
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,612
You know what? You really
shouldn't be drinking...

400
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:23,513
I... Actually, I... I don't
want to hear you go into

401
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:26,391
a tizzy about this, about me
drinking, please. All right?

402
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,411
I had to drink, 'cause if not,
I'm gonna kill this guy.

403
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,062
I'm gonna kill this man.
I love him. I love my husband,

404
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:34,065
but I do not like him.
And I don't like him right now.

405
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,776
And you are lucky that
you love and you like John.

406
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,738
Okay, right. Right?

407
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,283
Yes.

408
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,579
Yes, I... I love and like John.

409
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:50,040
It's just,
this distance is getting to me.

410
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,168
You know, I called him
this morning, and he said...

411
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,338
It doesn't even matter.

412
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,778
He doesn't even seem bothered,
and I'm, like,

413
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:01,676
- fuckin' losing it.
- Trust me, trust me.

414
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,845
John is going through it too.

415
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,767
Don't worry.
This is gonna pass eventually.

416
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,894
I thought you said
the world is ending.

417
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,021
Yeah, I said a lot of things.

418
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,441
Question is,
do I really believe it?

419
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,485
Maybe it's the gin talking,
I don't know.

420
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,904
Either way, I'm tired
and I'm gonna pass out.

421
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,448
Um, I'm gonna go to sleep.
Okay? Bye.

422
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:25,325
No, no, no, wait...

423
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:14,874
- Hey!
- Hey...

424
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:19,504
Uh, Julio's downstairs
in the living room

425
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:22,173
and he doesn't know about
my little friend here.

426
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:26,344
Oh my God, it's getting bad.

427
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:29,514
You know what? I got my
little friend right here, too.

428
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:33,268
Oh my goodness!
<i>¿Ya eso?</i>

429
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,563
You saw the news today?

430
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,023
Yeah.

431
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,819
John called.

432
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,738
Yeah, gin.

433
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,197
He said he thinks
he should, uh...

434
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,700
stay away for another week.

435
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,411
So.

436
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,165
Hmm.

437
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,585
You know that I've always
been jealous of the love

438
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,503
that you and John
have for each other?

439
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,629
Why?

440
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,634
Because... because
I was and am, stupid!

441
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:09,220
You remember the time that
we were all sitting around

442
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,952
your house in Connecticut,
and we were going around

443
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:14,309
and everybody had to say
what they would miss

444
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,144
if they never had it again?

445
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,563
And your John said,

446
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,587
"I can't imagine my life
without this woman.

447
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:24,235
"The thought of losing her
scares the shit out of me

448
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,321
"because I love her so much."

449
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:30,304
And then I said you guys were
pathetic cornballs, remember?

450
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,765
I know I remember 'cause
Julio followed that up with

451
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:34,913
he misses playing <i>Call of Duty.</i>

452
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:41,461
Oh, no, honey, that was supposed
to make you laugh, not cry.

453
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,338
No, I'm sorry. It's just...

454
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:47,174
I keep getting these
panic attacks, you know?

455
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:51,555
Like, I'm here all by myself.
Like, what if I die by myself?

456
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:54,391
You know? And, like...
You know, and then it's like,

457
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,768
what if you're right?
What if this is the end?

458
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:58,603
Have another drink with me.

459
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,314
You know, have another...
Light one of your joints.

460
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:04,609
Oh, God.
The hell is happening to you?

461
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:07,237
I don't know.

462
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,367
It's all right.

463
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,875
You know, I really should stop.

464
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,002
I mean, not the weed,
but, you know.

465
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,213
It's the liq...
This is truly the devil's water.

466
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:28,717
You know? It really is.

467
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,886
But, you know, it's just...

468
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,119
You know, I was thinking
this morning, if...

469
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,975
Maybe if I believed
in God like you,

470
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:40,437
maybe I would have some hope,
and I wouldn't be so fucked up

471
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,231
- and wouldn't worry, just...
- Believing...

472
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:48,028
doesn't miraculously wipe away
all your shortcomings.

473
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,571
Trust me on that one.

474
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,033
And you know that you do this?

475
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,535
You did this every time
Daddy went away for work,

476
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:57,495
'cause you were
daddy's little girl.

477
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,130
Yeah, well, at least
you were his best friend.

478
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,004
I was always so jealous of that,
that you two had that.

479
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,717
You were jealous of me...

480
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,385
and I was jealous of you.

481
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,140
Stupid!

482
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,918
He's gonna be home
in a week, all right?

483
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,316
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

484
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,401
Woo!

485
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,155
- Havin' a hot flash over here.
- Ahh!

486
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:33,572
Ahh! What?

487
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,408
Put it back on!

488
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,535
Shut up! You shut up,
because I bet you if you

489
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:39,496
take that hat off, you're gonna
look just like this.

490
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,474
- No, I ain't taking off shit.
- Come on, take it... why not?

491
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,792
It's just me.
Take it off.

492
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,211
Okay, fuck it.

493
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,632
Ugh, yeah.
You look like dried-up chia pet.

494
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,595
Well, at least I don't have
a hideous mustache growing!

495
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,888
That's...

496
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,557
That's so messed up.

497
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,518
Gigi...

498
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:05,522
Do you really think
this could be the end?

499
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,485
Honestly, I don't know.

500
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,656
You really don't believe in God?

501
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,660
Honestly, I don't know.

502
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,580
Do you?

503
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,127
Honestly, I don't know.

504
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,170
<i>! No joda!</i>

505
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,818
<i>! No joda, tu!</i>
And listen,

506
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:33,675
I'm gonna do a drive-by
for some weed tomorrow.

507
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:35,510
- Gigi!
- Desperate times call

508
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,721
for desperate measures.
I don't want to hear it.

509
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,268
Are you okay?

510
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,812
I'll be okay.

511
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,313
You okay?

512
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,814
Yeah.

513
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,107
I love you.

514
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,569
I love you more.

515
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,196
And please fix that hideous
mustache.

516
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,949
- Byeee!
- Bye.

517
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,410
I swear to God,

518
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,912
my entire Instagram feed
is sourdough porn.

519
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,579
Bread. Hot.

520
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,958
Yeah, I bet it tastes awful,
though.

521
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,711
I mean, think about it.
All these stay-at-home bakers.

522
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,087
I mean... I mean, imagine.

523
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,922
I mean, they don't know
what they're doing.

524
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:38,299
They're just bored
and trying to bake.

525
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,176
I actually read that there's

526
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,929
a whole art and science
to sourdough baking.

527
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,141
- How hard can it be?
- I don't want to point fingers,

528
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,351
but you burnt the pasta
last night. So...

529
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:51,603
I'm just saying, but you did.

530
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,606
Sam called.

531
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,232
Right.

532
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:59,029
Well, I, for one, would be

533
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:01,573
very up for some
fresh-baked sourdough.

534
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,012
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

535
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:05,827
No, you know, the thing is,
when this is over...

536
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,537
If this ever is over...

537
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,915
I don't think that
I want to be one of those...

538
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:14,043
pandemic sourdough people.
Sorry.

539
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:17,589
Whatever.
He's got his new chainsaw.

540
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,049
I'll get us some
sourdough starter.

541
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:22,177
It can be my contribution
to this whole...

542
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:24,512
<i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
cosplay.

543
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,681
Sure.

544
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,228
Does that... painting
look straight to you?

545
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:36,274
Doesn't look straight to me.

546
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:41,195
I like it better here.

547
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:42,655
Hmm?

548
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:46,950
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
No, it's good for now.

549
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:49,725
I don't know if just for now.
It's nice.

550
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:52,082
We have fresh air, we have
space.

551
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,524
I achieved some kind of minimal
competence with the chainsaw.

552
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,838
We'll have all
the firewood we ever need.

553
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,095
Right. But what if we...

554
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,032
I don't know.
Do you think we'd change

555
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,724
if we never went
back to the city, like...

556
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,728
- Then we'd be country people.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,026
You'd spend all your time
splitting wood, and I'd... I'd...

558
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,611
- Darn socks, and knit.
- Right.

559
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:24,155
And can things. Right.

560
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,740
'Cause, secretly,
you'd like that.

561
00:39:25,824 --> 00:39:27,367
- I...
- Little lady looking after

562
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,203
the house while you're
busy doing manly things.

563
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,664
I do like the idea of being...

564
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:35,208
more self-sufficient.

565
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,168
- Yeah.
- Less wasteful.

566
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,629
Yeah, of course.

567
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,509
Quite worried about Dory,
though.

568
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,096
Got to be strange,
being stuck up here

569
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,056
in her friend's house for
God knows how long, and...

570
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,726
boyfriend's miles away, and...

571
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:57,689
I don't know,
she's not exactly bucolic.

572
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:01,776
No.

573
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,530
Well, I don't know.

574
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,908
People change.

575
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,580
<i>These are
the folks, they're saying that,</i>

576
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:16,874
<i>"Hey-o, summertime,
civilization returns!</i>

577
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,919
<i>"Testing, testing will save us."</i>

578
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,672
<i>Loyal listeners, you heard it
here first.</i>

579
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,426
<i>This here, right now,
is hunker-down time.</i>

580
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,439
I mean, it's not like I'm saying

581
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,484
things are gonna be
back to normal by then.

582
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:45,779
I'm just saying there's
gonna be some new normal,

583
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,366
and that is going to be more
like real life than, like...

584
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,619
- you know, like this.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

585
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,914
Well, what are people gonna do,

586
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:59,167
just be like, "Hmm, well,
civilization, that was nice"?

587
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,336
Oh, shit, that's Sam.

588
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,089
Hey!

589
00:41:05,006 --> 00:41:07,842
Oh, God, I can't believe
it's four o'clock already.

590
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,428
I've literally
done nothing today.

591
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:12,931
Did you order sourdough starter?

592
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:15,432
- Hmm?
- Black death?

593
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,686
Mm-mm. Must have been Dory.

594
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,857
Does she seem straight to you?
She never seems straight to me.

595
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,403
- I hate that painting.
- Oh.

596
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:50,093
The YouTube woman
said you had to wait

597
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:53,096
until it was super buoyant
before baking.

598
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:54,723
<i>All right,
so let's just clear up</i>

599
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,766
<i>some misconceptions, shall we?</i>

600
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,269
<i>Prepping's not about 100 cans
of beans in your bunker.</i>

601
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,147
<i>It's about being
prepared for the day</i>

602
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,670
<i>when GrubHub's not delivering.
Ready for that day,</i>

603
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:08,111
<i>because you're who's gonna
be laughing then, huh?</i>

604
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:36,700
Bingo.

605
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,750
<i>You are alone.</i>

606
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:51,047
<i>Yeah, look around.
That's it, pal.</i>

607
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:56,699
<i>There's idiots out there
infecting each other</i>

608
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,055
<i>so they can
drink their cosmotinis.</i>

609
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,142
<i>I hope they're happy.
Are you?</i>

610
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,875
You're baking?

611
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,753
Mmm-hm.

612
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,838
Tonight, there will be bread.

613
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:17,008
I mean, are we done
flying on planes? Forever?

614
00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:23,640
Explain to me how there can even
be an airline industry anymore.

615
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:25,159
There's gonna be
five people per plane?

616
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:26,976
Explain the economics of that.

617
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:29,938
Shit, I'm sorry.

618
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:33,900
I'm sure you're gonna be able to
fly to London and see Sam again.

619
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:36,111
At some point.

620
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:38,821
I'm so glad you like the tajin.

621
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,991
I got the recipe off the
N <i>ew York Times </i>cooking app.

622
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,828
You should have some more bread.

623
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,371
I'm okay.

624
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,459
I can be the mother tonight.

625
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:56,589
You know, for somebody who
ordered their sourdough starter

626
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,217
as a joke, you've gotten
pretty into baking.

627
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,219
I didn't order the starter.

628
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:12,229
Stop. Don't do that.

629
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,482
I'll do the dishes.

630
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:16,192
No, it's fine.
You guys cooked.

631
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:19,738
Just relax.

632
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:23,158
You chopped a lot of wood today.

633
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:27,120
Ah. Uh...

634
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,414
It's all right. Just...

635
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:33,168
go watch something
stupid on television.

636
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,538
Sourdough pancakes look good.

637
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:17,045
There's a recipe
for sourdough pizza!

638
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,942

- Jesus.

Do you think we could

683
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:35,303

Next in line, step down, please.

696
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:14,069
<i>As we head into summer
the big question is...</i>

697
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,403
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry,

698
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:17,739
just need to get
the gingerbread...

699
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,741
Jenny, come up to the front.

700
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:27,165
You should have been
on break 15 minutes ago.

701
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,000
I'll take it from here,
thank you.

702
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,794
You're gonna get me in trouble.

703
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:32,754
They'll get over themselves.

704
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,550
- How are the boys?
- They're okay.

705
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,820
They've been with Jeffrey's mom
in St. Louis this whole time,

706
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:42,430
which is good, but I miss them.

707
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:46,768
- How are you guys?
- We're good.

708
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:48,311
Giving it over to God.

709
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,565
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

710
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:54,567
Thank you so much,
I appreciate it.

711
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:56,591
- Stay safe, TJ.
- You too. All righty, bye.

712
00:53:56,592 --> 00:53:58,905
Next in line, step down, please.

713
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,967
Hi, Millie!
Hi, Millie!

714
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,260
I missed you too. Come on.

715
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:06,598
Go outside.
Okay, let's go outside.

716
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:09,309
Good girl. Good girl!

717
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:18,985
Come on, come on.
Come to mama.

718
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:20,695
Good girl.

719
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,700
Okay.

720
00:55:43,301 --> 00:55:47,639
Two arms, no head.
Two arms, no head.

721
00:55:47,722 --> 00:55:50,433
Two arms, no head.

722
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:52,727
Two arms...

723
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:10,662
Hello?

724
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:14,499
- Surprise.
- Tarumi?

725
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:20,172
I've been trying to call you,
but you never answer your phone.

726
00:56:20,173 --> 00:56:22,069
Why didn't you leave a message?

727
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,113
Oh, my God,
I had to get out of the city

728
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,720
and I know that you guys
have the pool house.

729
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:32,642
Can you believe there's fucking
traffic during a pandemic?

730
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:33,851
Yeah.

731
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,770
- Are you looking at my hair?
- No.

732
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:37,689
- Please don't.
- No, it looks good.

733
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:39,482
Because I had to dye it
with Just For Men

734
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:40,692
- and it's all they had.
- Oh, you look really good.

735
00:56:40,693 --> 00:56:42,402
- You do.
- You are really,

736
00:56:42,485 --> 00:56:45,697
- still an incredibly bad liar.
- I'm not lying.

737
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,662
Oh, I am just,
oh, I'm so happy to see you.

738
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,291
I mean, I would be
happy to see anyone,

739
00:56:56,374 --> 00:56:58,959
even you, Millie,

740
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,254
and I hate dogs.

741
00:57:01,338 --> 00:57:03,297
Oh, where are the two Js?

742
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:06,155
They went to St. Louis
to visit Jeffrey's mother,

743
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,844
and they kind of
got stuck there.

744
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:09,054
Well, perfect.

745
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:11,077
Then I can stay in Julius' room

746
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:14,309
and I don't have to sleep in
that crappy bed. All right.

747
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:16,645
She's taking a nap.

748
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:19,272
<i>A nap?
Or is she passed out?</i>

749
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,399
She took a Benadryl
because she said she was having

750
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,588
an allergic reaction to

751
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:24,402
something that
I put in the eggs.

752
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:29,992
Oh, she was... she was having
a really hard time in the city.

753
00:57:29,993 --> 00:57:31,493
<i>Jen, when is your sister</i>

754
00:57:31,576 --> 00:57:32,807
<i>not having a really hard time?</i>

755
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:35,121
I think it's better when
she has a boyfriend.

756
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,916
<i>What happened to Eric?</i>

757
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:40,752
Well, um,
they broke up because he decided

758
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:43,088
he wasn't going to get divorced.

759
00:57:43,171 --> 00:57:44,756
<i>I didn't know he was married.</i>

760
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:46,840
Yeah. Thought I told you.

761
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:48,468
<i>No.</i>

762
00:57:52,597 --> 00:57:53,889
She's my sister.

763
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,788
What was I supposed to say?

764
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:57,477
<i>How about "No"?</i>

765
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,919
It's... you know, it's just
gonna be a couple of days

766
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,693
and she'll be gone
by the time you get home.

767
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:07,445
<i>Mmm. I'm...</i>

768
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:09,572
<i>I'm not exactly sure
when that's gonna be.</i>

769
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:13,389
Why? People are, people are
traveling. You could drive.

770
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,996
Cynthia and Bill just drove
to see her parents in Cleveland.

771
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,622
I want to see you.

772
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:20,332
<i>No, I just think I need</i>

773
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,003
<i>to stay here with mom
and Julius right now.</i>

774
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:27,173
<i>Look, keep your distance
from her, okay? And no hugging.</i>

775
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:28,567
<i>I don't really trust
her version of quarantine.</i>

776
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,968
Oh, that crane's back.

777
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:32,095
I'm gonna take a picture
to show you guys.

778
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,558
<i>Okay, babe, I'm gonna...</i>

779
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:37,934
<i>I'm gonna hop off, all right?</i>

780
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,894
<i>- I'll see you later.</i>
- Okay.

781
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,820
What are sisters for
if not to break up

782
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:51,132
- with your boyfriend for you?
- I can't believe it, though.

783
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,407
I mean, I really...
I can't believe

784
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,159
that you actually
managed to do it.

785
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,785
No, but I didn't plan it,
you know, you just went to

786
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:58,329
the bathroom and it just...
Blurted it out.

787
00:58:58,413 --> 00:59:00,915
- And I mean... What?
- What did you say?

788
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,542
What did you say to him again?

789
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:05,795
Oh my God, I said...
I said... I said,

790
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,797
"You know, I have...
I have good news."

791
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,674
- What was his name?
- His name was Tim.

792
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:12,177
I'm sorry.
"Okay, I have good news, Tim.

793
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,970
You're free to
date other people."

794
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,351
Well, it's never been hard
for you to be direct.

795
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:22,771
- That's... that's for sure.
- Yeah, got that from Dad.

796
00:59:22,772 --> 00:59:25,398
You know,
"You look fat in that dress."

797
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:29,778
Oh, you always knew
where you stood with him.

798
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,364
Actually, I'm really...

799
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:36,409
I'm glad he's not
around for all of this.

800
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,539
You should see
Bleecker Street, Jen...

801
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,876
It's... it's a war zone.

802
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,462
It's all boarded up.
It's sad.

803
00:59:49,255 --> 00:59:50,924
I mean, I'd have protested too

804
00:59:51,007 --> 00:59:52,967
if I knew I'd get
a free Marc Jacobs bag.

805
00:59:52,968 --> 00:59:56,679
- Hey, T.
- Oh, I'm just kidding. Okay?

806
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:02,184
I'm just very grateful that
you're letting me stay here.

807
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,602
Yeah, of course.

808
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:09,275
Of course she's letting her
sister stay here, right Millie?

809
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:11,945
Black dogs matter.

810
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,783
Black dogs matter.

811
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:21,329
You know, I suppose...

812
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:27,085
this would have been different
if Dr. J and Julius were here.

813
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,336
What would've?

814
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:30,505
I don't know,
just me staying here.

815
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:34,174
Well, yeah, it would have
been more complicated.

816
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,384
Hmm.

817
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,721
It always is with Dr. J.

818
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,681
Hey, you know, he hates it
when you call him that.

819
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:41,765
- Don't call him that.
- Come on, Jen.

820
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:44,019
I mean, anybody who's been
through medical school

821
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:46,354
is dying for you
to call them "Doctor,"

822
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,899
especially when they have
completely defied the odds.

823
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,694
"The odds"?
He went to Harvard.

824
01:00:52,777 --> 01:00:56,114
Oh, I think everyone
who knows him knows that.

825
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:01,035
I don't mean anything by it.

826
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:03,038
- I...
- You seeing anyone?

827
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,542
Lots of people, you know?

828
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,711
Really good time to be dating.

829
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:17,177
<i>I watched an old movie
with grandma, went on my phone,</i>

830
01:01:17,178 --> 01:01:20,012
<i>played some video games,
just sat around.</i>

831
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:23,725
<i>I went to the supermarket
with Dad, took a nap.</i>

832
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,435
Hey honey, can you stop
moving around so much?

833
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:26,853
You're making me dizzy.

834
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,981
<i>- Oh, sorry.</i>
- It's okay.

835
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,525
What do you... Do you guys
have any plans for tomorrow?

836
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,904
<i>Yeah.
Probably the same thing.</i>

837
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:38,073
<i>And in the afternoon,
we'll do the march.</i>

838
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:39,531
What march?

839
01:01:39,532 --> 01:01:43,243
<i>Dad said he told you,
but I guess he didn't.</i>

840
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:47,499
Oh, honey, I don't know.

841
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:49,417
I don't know
how I feel about that.

842
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:51,378
<i>Mom, come on.</i>

843
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,254
No, because, yeah,
because I'm your mom

844
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,840
and I want you to be safe
and I'm so far away.

845
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,009
<i>Mom, this is my time.</i>

846
01:01:58,426 --> 01:02:02,055
- It's your time?
<i>- Yeah, actually, it is.</i>

847
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,434
Okay. Um...

848
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,144
All right, just, um...

849
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:13,148
Just... just be...
Be really, really careful,

850
01:02:13,149 --> 01:02:15,360
and don't get into any trouble,

851
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:18,488
and don't get swept up in a mob
or anything like that.

852
01:02:18,988 --> 01:02:21,241
<i>Do you hear yourself right now?</i>

853
01:02:21,324 --> 01:02:22,826
<i>Remember when you
told me to tell you</i>

854
01:02:22,827 --> 01:02:24,536
<i>if you say anything
low-key racist?</i>

855
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:30,250
Mm-hmm. Okay, so just
wear your mask the whole time

856
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,336
and stay with your father.
Don't separate from him at all.

857
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,296
At all. Okay?

858
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,966
And I'm...
I'm really proud of you.

859
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:42,429
<i>- Okay, I will.</i>
- Love you.

860
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:43,763
<i>- Here's Dad.</i>
- Okay.

861
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,849
<i>Dad!</i>

862
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,103
<i>Hey.</i>

863
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,356
Were you gonna tell me?

864
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:56,318
<i>Well, I didn't want
to stress you out, Jen.</i>

865
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,695
Aren't you worried
about your mother?

866
01:02:59,654 --> 01:03:03,032
<i>Uh, so Julius didn't want to go</i>

867
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:06,244
<i>because he was
worried about her.</i>

868
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:09,164
<i>Then this is what
she left by his bed.</i>

869
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:15,002
<i>"J, you are a spectacular
gift for this mama bear</i>

870
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:18,381
<i>"and I appreciate you
worrying about me.</i>

871
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:20,154
<i>"There are many times
in our life</i>

872
01:03:20,155 --> 01:03:23,720
<i>"that just being with our
friends and family is enough,</i>

873
01:03:23,721 --> 01:03:26,639
<i>"but now is not
one of those times.</i>

874
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:30,602
<i>"You are a part of this change,
and this is important.</i>

875
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:34,772
<i>"You go and be my eyes,
and ears, and voice,</i>

876
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:37,150
<i>"and then wash your hands."</i>

877
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:43,823
I'm jealous.
I wish I was there with you.

878
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,203
I miss you guys.

879
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,332
<i>We miss you, too.</i>

880
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:59,381
<i>So did your sister
call me "Dr. J" yet?</i>

881
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:03,550
No, she's been pretty decent.
<i>Right.</i>

882
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:07,889
<i>What you guys been doing?</i>

883
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:11,643
Um, well, we finished
that parrot puzzle.

884
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,625
Which was really hard.

885
01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:16,815
<i>Yeah, because of
that piece that Millie ate.</i>

886
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,358
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

887
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:23,196
And... and we went
for a walk, um...

888
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:25,365
- to the liquor store.
<i>- Ah-ha.</i>

889
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:29,452
How is it that liquor stores
are essential services?

890
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,257
<i>- You look pretty.</i>
- You're a terrible liar.

891
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:48,826
<i>So, look,
I ordered that inhaler,</i>

892
01:04:48,827 --> 01:04:50,974
<i>it should be there
for you tomorrow.</i>

893
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:54,394
Thank you. I knew that marrying
a doctor was a good idea.

894
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:57,230
<i>- You always were the smart one.</i>
- Yeah.

895
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,026
You tired, baby?

896
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,409
When's this going to be over?

897
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:14,581
<i>- You mean this call?</i>
- No.

898
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:29,636
I love you.

899
01:05:29,637 --> 01:05:31,723
<i>Love you too, baby.</i>

900
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:07,300
T?

901
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:10,011
What's going on?

902
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:12,889
You all right?

903
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:15,975
Even the Ambien
doesn't do it for me anymore.

904
01:06:27,278 --> 01:06:28,738
It's not just you.

905
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,366
Everybody's stressed.

906
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:34,869
I'm not... I'm not
one of your patients.

907
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,412
Yeah.

908
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,915
I get it,
it's a tough time in the world

909
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:43,670
and all kinds of people are
going through all kinds of shit.

910
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:46,131
But I'm talking about me.

911
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:50,759
Me, and it just basically seems
that that's not allowed anymore.

912
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,138
What's not allowed?

913
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:58,143
Needs or feelings
if you're white.

914
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:01,146
So, yeah, I said it.

915
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:03,606
So you can just
fucking cancel me.

916
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:13,074
I'm lonely.

917
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,413
And I don't have
anyone who loves me, so...

918
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:31,718
And I defend you
all the time to people.

919
01:07:32,802 --> 01:07:34,220
Defend me to who?

920
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:39,100
I don't know.

921
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,685
My super.

922
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,482
Oh...

923
01:07:46,691 --> 01:07:49,778
People who you think
are your friends, anybody.

924
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:51,279
- Mom.
- Mom?

925
01:07:51,363 --> 01:07:52,488
Yeah, Mom.

926
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:56,618
Yeah, she never thought that
you should have married Jeffrey.

927
01:07:56,701 --> 01:07:59,246
She thought that you should've
married Daniel from college.

928
01:07:59,247 --> 01:08:01,456
That's because
she knows his mother.

929
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:04,959
No. That's because he was white,

930
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,379
and she thought that
your life would be harder

931
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,464
if you married Jeffrey.

932
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:21,267
So how come mine ended up
being the one that was hard?

933
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,177
Good morning.

934
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,127
Hey, um...

935
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:20,387
I wasn't at my best last night.

936
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:23,181
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

937
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:27,435
I know you're in trouble, T.

938
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,605
But you can't stay with us.

939
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:15,775
I don't understand
why every Saturday I ask for...

940
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,199
Wait, is that Jenny?

941
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,703
Jenny!

942
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:30,248
Jenny?

943
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:37,881
I think she can't hear me.

944
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:39,507
<i>With the march today,</i>

945
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:41,468
<i>we've now seen
ten consecutive days</i>

946
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:44,137
<i>of protests following
the killing of George Floyd</i>

947
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,743
<i>by police in Minneapolis.</i>

948
01:11:45,744 --> 01:11:48,933
<i>The police officers present
at the time of his death</i>

949
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:51,144
<i>have now been
arraigned in court.</i>

950
01:11:51,227 --> 01:11:53,938
<i>He referenced
Reverend Al Sharpton</i>

951
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:57,067
<i>when he called for a national
march in Washington.</i>

952
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:05,367
<i>The reverend wants to use
this rage and sadness</i>

953
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,391
<i>felt by the public to try
and get tangible police reform.</i>

954
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:11,456
<i>That's a continued spirit
felt here at the site</i>

955
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:13,500
<i>of George Floyd's killing.</i>

956
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:15,981
<i>A private funeral service
earlier for invited guests,</i>

957
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:18,213
<i>and of course,
family and friends</i>

958
01:12:18,296 --> 01:12:21,216
<i>had hundreds of people
outside in support.</i>

959
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:26,262
<i>They spoke to the people
at the memorial site</i>

960
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:28,598
<i>and thanked them for their love.</i>

961
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:32,456
<i>We've seen this growing before,</i>

962
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:34,855
<i>growing, sort of,
activism spring about</i>

963
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:38,066
<i>It's only gotten bigger
as the week has gone on.</i>

964
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:40,193
<i>As I'm sure you've seen,
the speedway over here</i>

965
01:12:40,276 --> 01:12:43,029
<i>has now kind of turned
into almost its own village.</i>

966
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,572
<i>There's a stage behind
me and people are putting</i>

967
01:12:44,656 --> 01:12:46,491
<i>their fists up in protest.</i>

968
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:50,412
<i>I guess it felt so long
to think that is how long</i>

969
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:54,249
<i>the prosecutors say the police
officer's knee was on his neck.</i>

970
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:55,833
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

971
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:11,159
I can't believe we did
that so many times in one night.

972
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,370
It was amazing.

973
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,330
You really are more
than I bargained for.

974
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:17,374
Oh, did you
think I'd be a bargain?

975
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:20,919
I don't normally take guys home.

976
01:14:21,002 --> 01:14:22,170
Not that I regret it.

977
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:24,255
Well, it's not my speed either,

978
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:27,759
especially to feel like
this about somebody so soon.

979
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,220
I know. It's crazy.

980
01:14:31,596 --> 01:14:33,890
What time is your flight again?

981
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,357
Soon.

982
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:48,863
Why do you have
to fly now of all times?

983
01:14:48,947 --> 01:14:51,825
Because it's where I live,
it's where I keep my stuff.

984
01:14:51,908 --> 01:14:53,952
Yeah, but why now? We don't
know what's gonna happen.

985
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:55,662
We might never
see each other again.

986
01:14:55,745 --> 01:14:57,455
Don't do this, please.

987
01:14:57,539 --> 01:14:59,624
We had such
a good time, you know,

988
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,418
of course
we're gonna see each other.

989
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,336
You don't know that.
Things are changing so fast.

990
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:05,651
Right. Then,
you come with me to LA.

991
01:15:05,652 --> 01:15:07,591
You know, I wasn't
kidding when I asked you.

992
01:15:07,592 --> 01:15:11,011
I can't do that and next week,
it might be too late.

993
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:12,177
You should stay.

994
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:14,889
You're being so dramatic.
Just knock it off.

995
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:16,891
And you're being
thoughtless and glib.

996
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,770
You know,
it's a little early for you

997
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,897
to be getting so needy,
don't you think?

998
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:24,441
Go to hell.

999
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:26,650
Get out of my house.

1000
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:28,737
- Leave.
- With pleasure.

1001
01:15:31,322 --> 01:15:33,199
You were too old for me anyway.

1002
01:15:34,951 --> 01:15:38,078
That's classy, really.
Thank you for that.

1003
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,290
I see I dodged a bullet.

1004
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,849
Hey.

1005
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,310
Hey.

1006
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:01,811
I'm so sorry I said that.

1007
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,856
No, I'm sorry.

1008
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,233
Well, I'm glad
you changed your mind.

1009
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:10,237
Uh, yeah, there's that and also,

1010
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:15,617
um, there's a travel ban so,
uh, canceled my flight.

1011
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,453
You were inside the terminal?

1012
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,622
Ugh, it was a madhouse.

1013
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,128
I see you got your luggage
back from the hotel.

1014
01:16:26,129 --> 01:16:28,755
Yeah. Well, I... you know,
when I went to the front desk,

1015
01:16:28,838 --> 01:16:30,131
they said they were
gonna close the place

1016
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:32,133
soon as I left.

1017
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,389
You should take a shower.

1018
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:40,183
Go... Go take a shower.

1019
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,061
You want me
to take a shower? Yeah?

1020
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:44,229
Doesn't it sound nice?

1021
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:45,522
Sure.

1022
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:48,274
Go. I might meet you in there.

1023
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:49,859
Well, all right, then.

1024
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:41,702
What the fuck?

1025
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,371
Hey!

1026
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:44,831
Wait!

1027
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:46,583
What the fuck?

1028
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,170
It's only for 14 days.
I'll use the guest bathroom.

1029
01:17:50,253 --> 01:17:55,257
Hey, hey, you get back here.
Get back here.

1030
01:17:55,258 --> 01:17:57,510
I'm gonna call the cops.

1031
01:18:00,805 --> 01:18:02,224
Do you have my phone?

1032
01:18:02,225 --> 01:18:05,435
Nope. Haven't seen it.

1033
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:16,404
What is that?

1034
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:27,832
What the fuck is going on?

1035
01:18:52,982 --> 01:18:56,111
Oh, come on. Scrambled again?

1036
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:01,241
Can you at least figure out

1037
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:03,284
how to cook
an egg without burning it?

1038
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:05,683
Well, I don't cook
and no one's delivering,

1039
01:19:05,684 --> 01:19:07,831
so you might as well
just get used to it.

1040
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:12,877
Oh, come on.

1041
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:20,010
Shut the fuck up!

1042
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:56,880
- What?
- You know the drill.

1043
01:20:11,811 --> 01:20:13,271
Hands up.

1044
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,731
Yeah.

1045
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:22,405
Beef Stroganoff.
I never made it before.

1046
01:20:22,655 --> 01:20:25,241
Did you know that
Stroganoff was a Russian town?

1047
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:27,786
I ate that shit for breakfast.

1048
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:35,877
Thought you might
like something to read

1049
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,837
to pass the time.

1050
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,634
You got anything from this year?

1051
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:52,602
You know what you're
doing is illegal, right?

1052
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:54,562
Yeah, well, what you did
should be illegal.

1053
01:20:54,646 --> 01:20:56,815
You went back
to your hotel room,

1054
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:59,483
you got into a filthy cab,

1055
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:03,446
you actually even entered
an international airport,

1056
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:07,492
all before bringing
your germs back into my home.

1057
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:12,455
It was an UberXL,
actually. Black XUV.

1058
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,542
Ugh, you just don't get it.

1059
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:23,109
Mom, you have
to wear your mask all the time.

1060
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:29,449
Well, no. Look, I'm not
trying to tell you what to do.

1061
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:33,661
I'm not. It's just that...
And what did he say?

1062
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:36,373
Well, tell doctor...
Tell him that you need it

1063
01:22:36,374 --> 01:22:38,917
for four weeks, Mom.

1064
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,481
I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just...

1065
01:22:40,482 --> 01:22:42,879
All I'm saying is that you
should have it for four weeks.

1066
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,007
You don't know how long this
thing's gonna take. That's all.

1067
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:49,968
Okay.

1068
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:52,639
And who's walking
the dog right now?

1069
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:29,027
Woo! Woo, woo, woo!

1070
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:34,574
Woo! Woo!

1071
01:24:35,533 --> 01:24:37,743
I left you a dinner.

1072
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:41,538
Slow poached chicken
breast with bacon dust.

1073
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:45,669
And for dessert,
a flaming strawberry flambé.

1074
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:48,088
Get it while it's hot.

1075
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:58,765
Mm. This is delicious.

1076
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:01,393
Glad you like it.

1077
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:05,897
Mm! How long does it
take to slow poach a chicken?

1078
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,192
Not very long.
It's only about 14 minutes.

1079
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,237
Mm, no kidding.

1080
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:20,912
I got it from a <i>New
York Times </i>recipe.

1081
01:25:29,421 --> 01:25:30,547
Thank you.

1082
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:32,716

01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:33,211
I'm so sorry.

1101
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:38,341
I'm so sorry.

1102
01:27:43,513 --> 01:27:44,973
Meet you at the door.

1103
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:58,653
It was thoughtless
for me to come back.

1104
01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:03,408
You know,
I never should have done it.

1105
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:07,912
That... My Uber
driver was sneezing.

1106
01:28:07,996 --> 01:28:09,372
I didn't even think about it.

1107
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:11,958
Did you touch him?

1108
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:15,545
A little bit. I mean,
in the places he asked me to.

1109
01:28:17,922 --> 01:28:20,467
I think I may
have overreacted too.

1110
01:28:20,468 --> 01:28:22,135
Oh, you think so?

1111
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:27,766
Seriously. My mom
almost died from a virus

1112
01:28:27,849 --> 01:28:31,227
when I was a kid. She was
really sick for a long time

1113
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:33,813
and I think it just
triggered something in me.

1114
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:35,690
It must have been awful.

1115
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:38,443
Yeah. And then I had to
spoon feed her Campbell's soup

1116
01:28:38,444 --> 01:28:42,280
for four weeks
before she got any better.

1117
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,282
No wonder... No wonder
you're such a good cook.

1118
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:49,244
I think I just get scared

1119
01:28:49,245 --> 01:28:52,206
when the people I love get sick.

1120
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,750
Not that I love you or anything,

1121
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,711
but I do care about you.

1122
01:28:57,587 --> 01:28:59,798
Well, we had a good thing going.

1123
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:01,591
For 12 hours anyway.

1124
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:04,552
Still pretty hot.

1125
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:26,324
Your turn.

1126
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:44,843
What are you doing down there?

1127
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:48,096
Nothing you
can't do to yourself.

1128
01:30:36,936 --> 01:30:39,105
Wow.

1129
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:40,294
Yeah.

1130
01:30:40,295 --> 01:30:42,317
I can't wait
to really touch you.

1131
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:45,278
How much longer
do I have to spend in here?

1132
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:48,073
When did we meet again?

1133
01:30:51,534 --> 01:30:53,036
April 10th.

1134
01:30:55,997 --> 01:30:58,166
Another couple of days.

1135
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:00,627
That's too bad.

1136
01:31:02,879 --> 01:31:05,465
So what's for dinner?

1137
01:32:10,864 --> 01:32:13,241
<i>Well, we're all
having to learn to live</i>

1138
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:15,890
<i>without our usual
comforts and routines.</i>

1139
01:32:15,891 --> 01:32:18,413
<i>I can't go for my weekly
shampoo and set,</i>

1140
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:21,248
<i>and my roots
are an absolute disaster.</i>

1141
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:23,230
<i>I mean, three and a half decades</i>

1142
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:25,816
<i>of having my nails done
and then lo and behold,</i>

1143
01:32:25,817 --> 01:32:28,256
<i>I discover I can
absolutely do it myself.</i>

1144
01:32:28,257 --> 01:32:30,821
<i>I could have
saved absolute fortunes.</i>

1145
01:32:30,822 --> 01:32:35,888
<i>Alex. Alex, darling,
are you smoking?</i>

1146
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,891
No, Mom. I'm not smoking.

1147
01:32:39,517 --> 01:32:41,061
<i>You sound like you're smoking?</i>

1148
01:32:41,062 --> 01:32:42,562
Yeah, well, I'm not.

1149
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:45,731
<i>You're getting lots of rest?</i>

1150
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:47,524
I'm trying.

1151
01:32:47,525 --> 01:32:51,488
<i>Oh, I want to see Jack.
Let me see him.</i>

1152
01:32:51,571 --> 01:32:53,573
<i>How is it that I go to video?</i>

1153
01:32:55,533 --> 01:32:57,369
<i>How do I get
to bloody video on this thing?</i>

1154
01:32:57,370 --> 01:32:59,954
<i>Oh, I know. It looks
like something's happening.</i>

1155
01:33:01,664 --> 01:33:04,625
<i>Oh, right, then. Hello.</i>

1156
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:09,381
Hi. Just...
Just give me a sec, okay?

1157
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:11,799
I gotta go into the house.

1158
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,345
<i>Oh, doesn't look
like a very nice day there.</i>

1159
01:33:15,428 --> 01:33:17,347
Is it nice where you are?

1160
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:19,598
<i>It's absolutely glorious here.</i>

1161
01:33:19,599 --> 01:33:21,351
That's nice.

1162
01:33:22,268 --> 01:33:23,561
<i>Okay, shh.</i>

1163
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:34,155
<i>Yeah, look, there he is.
Look at that.</i>

1164
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:39,285
<i>Look at the little face.
It's just marvelous.</i>

1165
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:40,870
<i>Alex.</i>

1166
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:44,207
<i>Wha... Is that the wardrobe?</i>

1167
01:33:44,208 --> 01:33:46,458
<i>What's he doing in the wardrobe?</i>

1168
01:33:46,459 --> 01:33:48,545
Mom, it's dark in here.

1169
01:33:48,628 --> 01:33:50,088
It's the only place
he'll go to sleep.

1170
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:51,296
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

1171
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:53,383
- Shh, shh, shh.
<i>- For goodness sake.</i>

1172
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:56,720
- Please don't wake him.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1173
01:34:02,726 --> 01:34:05,520
<i>Okay. Are you
taking any exercise?</i>

1174
01:34:05,603 --> 01:34:07,564
<i>Taking any fresh air?</i>

1175
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,150
<i>It'll do you good.</i>

1176
01:34:10,233 --> 01:34:13,028
<i>You look absolutely exhausted.</i>

1177
01:34:15,071 --> 01:34:16,531
Thank you.

1178
01:34:16,823 --> 01:34:19,576
<i>Darling,
I wish I was there with you.</i>

1179
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:21,119
Yeah, well you're not.

1180
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,808
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

1181
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:26,332
<i>Honestly, I'd rather that
you were alone than with him.</i>

1182
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:28,126
Mom.

1183
01:34:28,251 --> 01:34:31,671
<i>You know, leaving you
alone at a time like this?</i>

1184
01:34:31,672 --> 01:34:35,008
<i>What wa... What was...
What was he thinking of?</i>

1185
01:34:36,176 --> 01:34:38,053
<i>Where is he anyway?</i>

1186
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:43,808
Where do you think?

1187
01:34:46,853 --> 01:34:51,858
<i>Well, you know,
just got to keep yourself busy,</i>

1188
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:56,112
<i>distract yourself,
and there's no drinking, please.</i>

1189
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:58,740
<i>You know it makes you emotional.</i>

1190
01:34:58,823 --> 01:35:01,409
Mom, I'm hanging up now.
I'm going to hang up.

1191
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,620
<i>And just one... Let...
Let me just say one thing.</i>

1192
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:06,122
<i>This is really important
because I've read about it.</i>

1193
01:35:06,206 --> 01:35:10,501
<i>You know, deliveries...
Deliveries, 72 hours quarantine,</i>

1194
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:14,171
<i>that's what they
say, 72 hours. Alex?</i>

1195
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:16,091
<i>Alex, are you listening?</i>

1196
01:35:16,174 --> 01:35:18,510
<i>Shh. Shut up.</i>

1197
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:32,856

01:51:32,734 --> 01:51:33,651

No desperate desire

01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:04,057
to come and play Scrabble
with the kids or something?

1327
01:52:04,641 --> 01:52:06,706
No, honey,
I'd love to play Monopoly,

1328
01:52:06,707 --> 01:52:09,813
but I got to stop these
fuckers touching my damn fence!

1329
01:52:25,161 --> 01:52:27,121
Is he still on the...?

1330
01:52:27,122 --> 01:52:28,415
Yep.

1331
01:52:29,874 --> 01:52:31,835
It's your move.

1332
01:52:31,918 --> 01:52:33,044
Um...

1333
01:52:44,764 --> 01:52:46,891
I reckon he's gone crazy.

1334
01:52:49,185 --> 01:52:52,188
Am I being unreasonable
or should he shave?

1335
01:52:52,272 --> 01:52:55,734
He should shave, right?
Or at least have a shower.

1336
01:52:55,735 --> 01:52:57,444
What he should do
is give it a rest

1337
01:52:57,445 --> 01:52:59,696
and come back to
the land of the living.

1338
01:52:59,779 --> 01:53:01,364
I heard that.

1339
01:53:04,284 --> 01:53:07,162
Listen, I still don't
understand why us two

1340
01:53:07,163 --> 01:53:09,414
can't just go back
to the city and see people

1341
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:11,374
that are actually
interesting. I mean...

1342
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:13,668
I mean, we can't even die of it.

1343
01:53:16,546 --> 01:53:18,465
Well, I don't think
it's a good idea.

1344
01:53:18,466 --> 01:53:20,967
And even if
I was to sign off on it,

1345
01:53:20,968 --> 01:53:24,054
good luck getting
past the man upstairs.

1346
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:27,349
It's your turn.

1347
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:32,562
Hey, come on.
Come on, wake up. Wake up.

1348
01:53:32,645 --> 01:53:33,772
What?

1349
01:53:35,523 --> 01:53:38,464
Right. So I've got
a pretty crazy idea,

1350
01:53:38,465 --> 01:53:41,237
but you got to just indulge
me for a second, all right?

1351
01:53:41,321 --> 01:53:42,530
All right.

1352
01:53:43,573 --> 01:53:45,533
Okay, so... so we can both agree

1353
01:53:45,534 --> 01:53:48,161
that we've got to get
out of this place, right?

1354
01:53:48,244 --> 01:53:49,329
Sure.

1355
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:52,248
So, why don't we just do it?

1356
01:53:52,332 --> 01:53:53,832
Me, you, no Mom, and...

1357
01:53:53,833 --> 01:53:57,753
And definitely no Dad.
We can go to the city

1358
01:53:57,754 --> 01:54:00,674
and we can see
all our friends and...

1359
01:54:00,757 --> 01:54:03,802
And it'll pretty much just
be exactly like normal.

1360
01:54:07,263 --> 01:54:11,059
And Mom pretty much
just signed off on it anyway.

1361
01:54:13,895 --> 01:54:17,232
Okay, but fuck off,
I'm trying to sleep.

1362
01:54:23,196 --> 01:54:26,032
We should tie him up
so he doesn't wake up

1363
01:54:26,033 --> 01:54:27,575
and screw the plan.

1364
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,495
Agreed.

1365
01:55:17,917 --> 01:55:19,461
Hey, could you stop that?

1366
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:21,463
No.

1367
01:55:26,926 --> 01:55:27,928
I know what we should do.

1368
01:55:27,929 --> 01:55:29,971
Let's go and get some fresh air.

1369
01:55:30,930 --> 01:55:33,433
Wait, but by fresh air,
do you mean just going out

1370
01:55:33,516 --> 01:55:35,435
in the car
and staying in the car?

1371
01:55:35,518 --> 01:55:38,229
Hey, you want to come?
We're gonna go for a drive.

1372
01:55:39,272 --> 01:55:40,398
Yeah.

1373
01:55:41,941 --> 01:55:44,048
Or maybe we could do it
tonight, like, maybe 11:00

1374
01:55:44,049 --> 01:55:47,489
or something when the front
lawn activity goes down.

1375
01:56:12,847 --> 01:56:15,350
Sir, I want
you to step away from the fence.

1376
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:18,061
No, I want you to step away
from the fence.

1377
01:56:18,144 --> 01:56:20,397
You don't even have
any gloves on.

1378
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,148
What is he doing?

1379
01:56:22,232 --> 01:56:24,067
No, I want you
to step away from the fence.

1380
01:56:24,068 --> 01:56:26,736
You know our doorbell
that's got that camera

1381
01:56:26,737 --> 01:56:30,532
and everything?
It's got a two-way speaker.

1382
01:56:32,742 --> 01:56:36,454
Well, at least he came.
Whatever, we're here now.

1383
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:39,874
Look how beautiful it is.

1384
01:56:46,673 --> 01:56:48,550
Well...

1385
01:56:48,633 --> 01:56:50,433
Stop. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1386
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:52,658
Going for a walk.

1387
01:56:52,659 --> 01:56:55,348
No. No, no, no, no, no. No.
You can get fresh air from here.

1388
01:56:55,349 --> 01:56:57,976
You'll get a tick in there
and get Lyme disease and die.

1389
01:56:58,059 --> 01:57:00,227
Hey, don't go into the forest.

1390
01:57:00,228 --> 01:57:01,562
You'll get a tick in there,

1391
01:57:01,563 --> 01:57:03,273
and then you get
Lyme disease and then...

1392
01:57:03,356 --> 01:57:04,566
And then die.

1393
01:57:06,776 --> 01:57:08,153
Okay.

1394
01:57:18,538 --> 01:57:20,415
I made you guys some cookies.

1395
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:22,542
I don't care how great
you're feeling,

1396
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:24,169
you could be asymptomatic.

1397
01:57:24,252 --> 01:57:26,004
You could be running
up and down my block,

1398
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,797
you could still be spreading it
all over the place.

1399
01:57:29,257 --> 01:57:31,698
What, is that the antibody test?

1400
01:57:31,699 --> 01:57:35,555
It's unreliable. Fauci says
the antibody test is unreliable.

1401
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:37,097
Cookies are great, Mom.

1402
01:57:37,098 --> 01:57:40,434
If you stand out...
If you stand outside my fence

1403
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:44,481
and I watch you for 14 days,
then you can touch my fence.

1404
01:57:44,939 --> 01:57:47,484
That a deal?
Okay, great.

1405
01:57:48,026 --> 01:57:49,735
How about Monopoly?

1406
01:57:49,736 --> 01:57:52,197
That takes ages, though.

1407
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:54,866
Oh, we've got ages.

1408
01:57:56,409 --> 01:57:58,745
Um, well,
what else is there here?

1409
01:57:58,828 --> 01:58:01,664
We could do a puzzle, that
only takes a couple of days.

1410
01:58:01,665 --> 01:58:04,668
No. We don't have
time for a puzzle, do we?

1411
01:58:04,751 --> 01:58:07,002
Um, okay, well, what else?

1412
01:58:07,003 --> 01:58:09,464
There's... There's Parcheesi,

1413
01:58:09,881 --> 01:58:14,593
there's Risk, there's Sorry.

1414
01:58:14,594 --> 01:58:17,639
I think there's Clu...
Yup, there's Clue.

1415
01:58:18,682 --> 01:58:20,516
We could play chess?

1416
01:58:20,517 --> 01:58:22,686
Why don't we just play Go Fish?

1417
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:30,193
Go Fish. Okay. Yeah. Why not?
Let's play Go Fish.

1418
01:58:31,361 --> 01:58:34,239
Hey, you wanna come and hang?

1419
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,366
Yeah.

1420
01:58:37,575 --> 01:58:39,411
Can I hang from up here?

1421
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,063
Totally. You know, that's...
Yeah, why not?

1422
01:58:46,064 --> 01:58:48,586
You can... We can
hear you from down here.

1423
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:51,339
It's a great idea.

1424
01:58:53,633 --> 01:58:55,051
One good thing
is that apparently,

1425
01:58:55,052 --> 01:58:58,722
only 6% of people
can get it again,

1426
01:58:58,805 --> 01:59:02,058
which means that New York
will have herd immunity,

1427
01:59:02,142 --> 01:59:04,144
or whatever you call it
really quite soon,

1428
01:59:04,145 --> 01:59:06,146
so that's great.

1429
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:07,501
Mom, did you read that

1430
01:59:07,502 --> 01:59:09,816
from <i>The New York Times</i>
article this morning?

1431
01:59:09,899 --> 01:59:10,984
Yeah.

1432
01:59:10,985 --> 01:59:13,569
It was 60%, not six.

1433
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:16,197
Oh, oh.

1434
01:59:17,365 --> 01:59:19,576
Well, if you think
about it, that's not...

1435
01:59:19,577 --> 01:59:22,620
No, that's...
that isn't great.

1436
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:42,056
<i>Good evening, we have...</i>

1437
01:59:42,057 --> 01:59:43,558
Do you have it?

1438
01:59:45,769 --> 01:59:49,189
<i>All are reporting
a spike in cases.</i>

1439
01:59:52,692 --> 01:59:54,590
<i>Months into quarantine,</i>

1440
01:59:54,591 --> 01:59:57,322
<i>we are not out of the woods yet.</i>

1441
01:59:57,405 --> 02:00:00,950
<i>And with the vaccine months
away from approval...</i>

1442
02:00:01,493 --> 02:00:03,495
Good luck, asshole.

1443
02:00:34,484 --> 02:00:36,528
Did we get
the time wrong or something?

1444
02:00:56,798 --> 02:00:58,008
It's pretty cold.

1445
02:00:59,009 --> 02:01:00,135
Yeah.

1446
02:01:01,845 --> 02:01:03,054
Did you bring a coat?

1447
02:01:03,763 --> 02:01:05,014
No.

1448
02:01:05,015 --> 02:01:06,432
Me neither.

1449
02:01:06,433 --> 02:01:08,309
But I brought this.

1450
02:01:32,667 --> 02:01:34,419
Do you want to go home?

1451
02:01:36,212 --> 02:01:37,339
Yeah.

1452
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:15,705
<i>It's Ethan.
I assume Internet outage.</i>

1453
02:04:15,789 --> 02:04:17,874
<i>We're fine here.
Still stuck in Paris,</i>

1454
02:04:17,957 --> 02:04:19,793
<i>but I need to hear
from you at some point.</i>

1455
02:04:19,876 --> 02:04:22,712
<i>Jessie tested negative,
which is a relief supreme.</i>

1456
02:04:22,796 --> 02:04:26,049
<i>We are officially in her
second trimester, officially.</i>

1457
02:04:26,132 --> 02:04:28,301
<i>Yay. Call me, please.</i>

1458
02:04:30,637 --> 02:04:32,493
<i>Hi, it's Peg.
I sent you an email,</i>

1459
02:04:32,494 --> 02:04:35,392

1460
02:04:35,475 --> 02:04:37,665

1461
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:39,896

1462
02:04:39,897 --> 02:04:42,565

1463
02:04:42,649 --> 02:04:44,651

1464
02:04:44,734 --> 02:04:47,487

<i>Ugh. Hey, what would you take?
Valium, Xanax, trazodone?</i>

1472
02:05:11,803 --> 02:05:14,014

02:05:20,687 --> 02:05:24,149
Ethan, I'm fine, just busy.

1476
02:05:40,665 --> 02:05:42,500
People speak in exclamations.

1477
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:47,005

02:12:11,348 --> 02:12:13,099
It doesn't work
that way, apparently.

1537
02:12:13,183 --> 02:12:14,476
What do you think about that?

1538
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:16,269
I think it's a good thing.

1539
02:12:16,353 --> 02:12:18,563
When you have a kid,
you stop being someone else's.

1540
02:12:18,564 --> 02:12:19,940
I don't know if that's true.

1541
02:12:19,941 --> 02:12:22,650
Oh, why would
you agree with me now?

1542
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:27,614
I'm selling all the cows,
all the blooded stock,

1543
02:12:27,697 --> 02:12:30,491
and your tractors,
and your implements

1544
02:12:30,492 --> 02:12:32,201
and all your tool sets.

1545
02:12:32,202 --> 02:12:34,829
Not my dad's socket set.

1546
02:12:34,913 --> 02:12:37,228
Especially your
dad's socket set.

1547
02:12:37,229 --> 02:12:40,210
Every Goddamn
wrench, pliers, spreaders,

1548
02:12:40,211 --> 02:12:43,672
splitting maul.
Yeah. And give me that axe.

1549
02:12:44,631 --> 02:12:47,132
This is not mine.
This was issued.

1550
02:12:47,133 --> 02:12:48,260
Issued?

1551
02:12:48,261 --> 02:12:49,657
Yeah. Before that I got this

1552
02:12:49,658 --> 02:12:51,304
really cool water pail,

1553
02:12:51,388 --> 02:12:52,556
it's around somewhere.

1554
02:12:52,557 --> 02:12:54,724
You know, everything must go,
buddy.

1555
02:12:54,808 --> 02:12:56,142
That is right.

1556
02:13:00,146 --> 02:13:03,108
You're going to wait
here while I go get him?

1557
02:13:03,983 --> 02:13:05,235
Be right there, babe.

1558
02:13:08,738 --> 02:13:11,573
Oh, God. I'm so absentminded.

1559
02:13:11,574 --> 02:13:13,867
Yet so present-bodied.

1560
02:13:13,868 --> 02:13:15,203
Shut...

1561
02:13:16,746 --> 02:13:18,623
Hey. They...

1562
02:13:30,176 --> 02:13:31,302
Buddy.

1563
02:13:43,023 --> 02:13:46,234
Oh, God.
I miss that little dog.

1564
02:13:47,736 --> 02:13:49,112
You do?

1565
02:13:49,195 --> 02:13:50,822
Yeah, who'd have thunk?

1566
02:13:52,949 --> 02:13:55,035
He was a good dog.

1567
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:56,619
Remember that time up on...

1568
02:13:56,703 --> 02:13:59,330
Hush. Please.

1569
02:14:21,895 --> 02:14:24,063
You need to work, Helen.

1570
02:14:24,064 --> 02:14:28,610
Well, I can't. I can't work.

1571
02:14:28,902 --> 02:14:35,617
I can't do anything
and I hate you.

1572
02:14:36,576 --> 02:14:41,039
I hate you
for missing this. All this...

1573
02:14:41,915 --> 02:14:45,751
You just escaped this
stupid, scary bullshit,

1574
02:14:45,752 --> 02:14:50,924
murderous time
of the bloated fucking clowns.

1575
02:14:56,179 --> 02:15:02,102
You are just a lucky,
dead, uninformed, complicit,

1576
02:15:02,185 --> 02:15:05,354
complacent, motherfucker.

1577
02:15:05,355 --> 02:15:07,023
Lucky?

1578
02:15:07,107 --> 02:15:10,151
Yeah, lucky. That's right.

1579
02:15:12,112 --> 02:15:14,279
You and your Goddamn heart.

1580
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,365
It was a pretty good heart.

1581
02:15:16,366 --> 02:15:18,952
It was a bad heart. Bad.

1582
02:15:19,035 --> 02:15:20,578
Only there at the end.

1583
02:15:21,621 --> 02:15:25,000
God, I wish you were
here so I could kill you!

1584
02:15:42,934 --> 02:15:46,229
I can't do this!
I can't do this!

1585
02:15:46,312 --> 02:15:48,356
- Do what?
- Living!

1586
02:15:51,693 --> 02:15:52,986
Living.

1587
02:15:53,486 --> 02:15:55,613
Well, you're doing it, babe.

1588
02:16:03,955 --> 02:16:06,624
<i>♪ It ain't me, Dave ♪</i>

1589
02:16:07,417 --> 02:16:09,710

1590
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:11,337

02:16:11,338 --> 02:16:15,133

1592
02:16:20,513 --> 02:16:24,309

02:16:25,435 --> 02:16:28,813

1596
02:18:22,427 --> 02:18:25,722
Be right there.

1597
02:18:26,639 --> 02:18:32,729
Frenchy, it's your deadbeat dad
coming for the custody dog.

1598
02:18:32,812 --> 02:18:35,857
Oh, come on baby.
Here we go.

1599
02:18:39,069 --> 02:18:41,362
God. Ugh.

1600
02:18:41,363 --> 02:18:44,783
Baby Jane, what happened to you?

1601
02:18:55,627 --> 02:18:56,753
Okay.

1602
02:18:58,421 --> 02:18:59,714
Oh, jeez.

1603
02:19:04,511 --> 02:19:07,597
Hey, Claire. How you doing?

1604
02:19:07,681 --> 02:19:08,807
Great.

1605
02:19:08,808 --> 02:19:11,183
Frenchy no longer eats dog food.

1606
02:19:11,184 --> 02:19:13,853
There's chicken
and beef in the bag.

1607
02:19:14,938 --> 02:19:16,773
Don't judge, Brian, he's old.

1608
02:19:16,774 --> 02:19:18,942
You like your comforts.

1609
02:19:19,025 --> 02:19:20,151
Where's your mask?

1610
02:19:20,777 --> 02:19:22,862
It's in the car.

1611
02:19:22,946 --> 02:19:25,198
I... I put it on
when I go into stores.

1612
02:19:25,199 --> 02:19:26,658
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1613
02:19:26,659 --> 02:19:28,785
Because every time I go
into the supermarket

1614
02:19:28,868 --> 02:19:31,621
and there's someone going
cluelessly down the wrong aisle,

1615
02:19:31,622 --> 02:19:34,374
it's usually a guy
not wearing a mask

1616
02:19:34,457 --> 02:19:36,292
who thinks he's invulnerable.

1617
02:19:36,376 --> 02:19:39,129
Well, I don't think
I'm invulnerable.

1618
02:19:39,212 --> 02:19:40,922
Good, because you're not.

1619
02:19:41,423 --> 02:19:43,924
- Bye.
- Bye, Frenchy.

1620
02:19:43,925 --> 02:19:45,719
Remember our signal,

1621
02:19:45,802 --> 02:19:47,387
I'll know if you don't get
your treats.

1622
02:19:47,388 --> 02:19:49,931
Ugh!

1623
02:19:50,015 --> 02:19:52,766
It's my allergies.
I don't have it.

1624
02:19:52,767 --> 02:19:55,228
I know!

1625
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:57,772
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1626
02:20:07,741 --> 02:20:11,661
Hello. Hello, my baby.

1627
02:20:22,922 --> 02:20:24,674
Hello, my darling.

1628
02:20:24,758 --> 02:20:27,218
Hello, hello.

1629
02:20:32,182 --> 02:20:33,808
Now what?

1630
02:20:37,604 --> 02:20:40,774
He... He... He
was howling in the car.

1631
02:20:40,857 --> 02:20:43,026
I'd never heard him do that
and I had to turn around.

1632
02:20:43,109 --> 02:20:45,861
Oh, my God.
Are you okay, Frenchy?

1633
02:20:45,862 --> 02:20:46,945
Oh, my God.

1634
02:20:46,946 --> 02:20:48,782
I don't know... I don't know.

1635
02:20:48,865 --> 02:20:50,950
- Howling?
- He... Well, he was now,

1636
02:20:51,034 --> 02:20:53,536
and then he was whimpering
after that, so...

1637
02:20:53,537 --> 02:20:54,871
Oh, my God.

1638
02:20:54,954 --> 02:20:57,582
I'll, uh... I'll stay?

1639
02:20:57,874 --> 02:21:00,210
If it's okay,
if you... if you think so.

1640
02:21:00,293 --> 02:21:01,795
- Okay, okay.
- Just in case?

1641
02:21:01,796 --> 02:21:04,046
Yeah, yeah. You coming?

1642
02:21:04,047 --> 02:21:06,049
Yeah, yeah.

1643
02:21:06,132 --> 02:21:07,717
Yeah, why don't
you stay overnight

1644
02:21:07,718 --> 02:21:09,928
until we know he's okay?

1645
02:21:24,609 --> 02:21:27,737
What are you doing up?
You're never up this early

1646
02:21:27,821 --> 02:21:29,572
- unless you're on a job.
- Hey, does that turkey

1647
02:21:29,573 --> 02:21:32,117
wake you up every morning
at 6:00 a.m.?

1648
02:21:32,118 --> 02:21:34,326
- He's needy.
- Mm.

1649
02:21:34,327 --> 02:21:36,976
You see in his reflection
in the window,

1650
02:21:36,977 --> 02:21:39,582
he's beating that head
against the window

1651
02:21:39,666 --> 02:21:41,376
thinking it's another turkey.

1652
02:21:42,252 --> 02:21:44,692
He runs toward me every morning,

1653
02:21:44,693 --> 02:21:47,674
like we're in a romance novel
and have come back

1654
02:21:47,675 --> 02:21:50,969
from another century to be his
and his alone.

1655
02:21:52,679 --> 02:21:55,557
You're watching a lot
of O <i>utlander, </i>huh?

1656
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:57,684
No.

1657
02:22:01,229 --> 02:22:05,108
You know, I think I had some
wooden shutters in the shed

1658
02:22:05,191 --> 02:22:06,735
I could put up for you

1659
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:10,030
and then he'd... he'd
stopped banging his head.

1660
02:22:10,113 --> 02:22:13,304
Because it's impossible to think
that I'd be his lover, right?

1661
02:22:13,305 --> 02:22:16,161
It's impossible to think
that I'd be anybody's lover.

1662
02:22:16,162 --> 02:22:18,955
I'm just saying I could put up
some shutters

1663
02:22:19,039 --> 02:22:20,540
so you could sleep in.

1664
02:22:21,041 --> 02:22:24,878
Okay.

1665
02:22:29,132 --> 02:22:33,470
Let's... Let's hear the death
count for today.

1666
02:22:33,553 --> 02:22:35,138
<i>Confirmed cases in the US...</i>

1667
02:22:35,139 --> 02:22:38,141
It's still the sound thing
bugging you, huh?

1668
02:22:38,142 --> 02:22:41,310
It's called misophonia
and it's a real thing.

1669
02:22:41,311 --> 02:22:45,189
Yeah. Sounds pretty real to me.

1670
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:48,067
Oh, you believe it now?

1671
02:22:48,068 --> 02:22:50,216
You said it was all in my head.

1672
02:22:50,217 --> 02:22:52,906
<i>In America,
there are millions of dogs</i>

1673
02:22:52,989 --> 02:22:54,261
<i>left in the cold.</i>

1674
02:22:54,262 --> 02:22:56,910
It said dogs, dogs in cages.
Give me the remote.

1675
02:22:56,993 --> 02:23:00,663
- You got the remote.
- Oh. Mute, mute. Mute.

1676
02:23:03,249 --> 02:23:05,126
You know what? I'm going to...

1677
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:07,671
I'm gonna go take
a look in the shed

1678
02:23:07,754 --> 02:23:09,172
and look for those
wooden shutters.

1679
02:23:09,255 --> 02:23:10,382
Okay.

1680
02:23:10,465 --> 02:23:12,967
Ah!

1681
02:23:13,843 --> 02:23:16,179
I have antihistamines.

1682
02:23:16,262 --> 02:23:18,223
You don't have to suffer.

1683
02:23:19,516 --> 02:23:21,393
So I don't have to suffer.

1684
02:23:23,269 --> 02:23:24,938
Oh...

1685
02:23:26,314 --> 02:23:28,483
- Brian.
- Hmm?

1686
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:33,779
Oh! Nice idea.

1687
02:23:33,780 --> 02:23:35,553
We shouldn't be smoking, though.

1688
02:23:35,554 --> 02:23:38,868
I've got edibles... I've got
edibles, over there.

1689
02:23:38,869 --> 02:23:42,914
Ah! Smells so good.

1690
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:44,832
Good harvest?

1691
02:23:44,833 --> 02:23:48,628
<i>- Abbondanza!</i>Let me show you.
- Let me see.

1692
02:23:50,088 --> 02:23:53,258
Smells so good, my God.

1693
02:23:56,594 --> 02:23:59,681
<i>Abbondanza!</i>

1694
02:24:01,725 --> 02:24:05,687
I got to... I'm sorry.
I got to see this guy.

1695
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:10,692
<i>Well, I think
it's important for people</i>

1696
02:24:10,693 --> 02:24:12,861
<i>to understand
how the data comes in,</i>

1697
02:24:12,944 --> 02:24:14,675
<i>a lot of data that we're

1698

1699
02:24:18,074 --> 02:24:19,555

1700
02:24:19,556 --> 02:24:23,496
<i>- based on the type...</i>
- Stupid lug. What're you doing?

1701
02:24:24,164 --> 02:24:28,083
Spelling Bee. It's a word
puzzle, I'm addicted.

1702
02:24:28,084 --> 02:24:31,337
Yeah? I wanna play.

1703
02:24:31,338 --> 02:24:33,173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1704
02:24:33,256 --> 02:24:35,884
- Get a paper and pen.
- All right.

1705
02:24:41,348 --> 02:24:42,599
What's this? A new puzzle?

1706
02:24:42,682 --> 02:24:43,808
Yeah.

1707
02:24:44,726 --> 02:24:46,102
Yeah.

1708
02:24:48,855 --> 02:24:52,192
So would Raman be a word?

1709
02:24:52,275 --> 02:24:56,112
No, I told you no proper names,
and anyway, there's an E.

1710
02:24:56,196 --> 02:24:57,822
Da... Shit.

1711
02:24:59,115 --> 02:25:00,242
How many do you have?

1712
02:25:00,243 --> 02:25:02,369
I'm two points short of genius.

1713
02:25:02,370 --> 02:25:04,829
Oh...

1714
02:25:04,913 --> 02:25:06,206
Let me see what you wrote.

1715
02:25:06,207 --> 02:25:07,999
No, not yet, no.

1716
02:25:08,875 --> 02:25:11,252
I'm gonna make some tea,
you want some?

1717
02:25:12,128 --> 02:25:13,672
- No, thanks.
- What did you do?

1718
02:25:15,882 --> 02:25:19,344
Nice passive aggressive move
there, buddy.

1719
02:25:20,637 --> 02:25:22,389
I always liked that about you.

1720
02:25:23,264 --> 02:25:25,058
Well, because you are too.

1721
02:25:25,059 --> 02:25:26,643
Just because you can spell.

1722
02:25:26,726 --> 02:25:28,145
I can make spells too.

1723
02:25:28,146 --> 02:25:30,543
Remember when you were scared
of me because of my...

1724
02:25:30,544 --> 02:25:32,565
No. No.
Double-jointed thumbs?

1725
02:25:32,649 --> 02:25:34,109
You thought I was a witch?

1726
02:25:34,359 --> 02:25:36,736
- And you remember when you...
- Don't even.

1727
02:25:38,988 --> 02:25:42,117
Jeez, come on. This is...
This is almost genius.

1728
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:45,662
I put a spell on you.

1729
02:25:45,745 --> 02:25:46,996
So, uh...

1730
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,668
Is it okay?

1731
02:25:51,751 --> 02:25:54,629
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna head to bed.

1732
02:25:56,589 --> 02:25:59,050
I gotta ask you a question.

1733
02:26:00,468 --> 02:26:03,012
How come these nuts
drive you crazy,

1734
02:26:03,013 --> 02:26:07,058
but the turkey gobble
sounds don't?

1735
02:26:07,559 --> 02:26:11,813
I... I don't know. I don't know.

1736
02:26:12,772 --> 02:26:14,149
Oh, man.

1737
02:26:14,691 --> 02:26:16,066
They drive me nuts.

1738
02:26:16,067 --> 02:26:18,570
I drive myself nuts.

1739
02:26:22,365 --> 02:26:23,491
Goodnight.

1740
02:26:27,954 --> 02:26:29,039
Goodnight.

1741
02:26:31,916 --> 02:26:34,044
Hello!

1742
02:26:36,463 --> 02:26:39,090
Come, my darlings, come.

1743
02:26:41,718 --> 02:26:43,011
Come on!

1744
02:26:51,269 --> 02:26:55,523
Your turkey husband
sounds happy today.

1745
02:26:56,733 --> 02:26:59,319
You're jealous of a turkey now?

1746
02:26:59,402 --> 02:27:01,279
No, I am not.

1747
02:27:01,821 --> 02:27:04,783
But I think Frenchy is.

1748
02:27:06,117 --> 02:27:09,037
- Frenchy.
- Yeah.

1749
02:27:13,917 --> 02:27:17,212
You know, I think Frenchy
is happier with me here.

1750
02:27:19,005 --> 02:27:20,131
Yeah?

1751
02:27:26,388 --> 02:27:29,724
Maybe we should try
to watch something else.

1752
02:27:31,518 --> 02:27:34,646
I'm beyond depressed looking
at these death counts.

1753
02:27:34,647 --> 02:27:39,234
Then social distancing for those
lucky enough to still be alive.

1754
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:43,780
You wanna play
that word game again?

1755
02:27:43,863 --> 02:27:46,074
I don't know. You gonna
scribble on my hand again?

1756
02:27:46,157 --> 02:27:48,535
I don't know. I might.

1757
02:27:49,035 --> 02:27:51,746
Okay. I'll set up the computer.

1758
02:27:54,124 --> 02:27:56,334
You can do four-letter words.

1759
02:27:56,418 --> 02:27:59,275
Proper names are still not
allowed, no eating nuts.

1760
02:27:59,276 --> 02:28:02,841
Oh, see, that's... that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

1761
02:28:02,842 --> 02:28:05,301
- Nuts?
- Yeah, social distancing.

1762
02:28:05,927 --> 02:28:12,058
Look, I think we like each other
enough to socially distance.

1763
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:14,476
Well, I mean, any loud food.

1764
02:28:14,477 --> 02:28:17,230
If I'm eating nuts or an apple,

1765
02:28:17,313 --> 02:28:19,315
okay, or... any loud food.

1766
02:28:19,399 --> 02:28:20,441
What if I said

1767
02:28:20,442 --> 02:28:25,071
I'll make a pact with you to
socially distance for loud food.

1768
02:28:25,155 --> 02:28:26,636
If I eat an apple,

1769
02:28:26,637 --> 02:28:31,827
I'll... I'll... I'll stand over
here and... nuts, anything.

1770
02:28:31,828 --> 02:28:33,204
Otherwise...

1771
02:28:34,873 --> 02:28:36,207
Claire?

1772
02:28:46,009 --> 02:28:49,054
Pact?

1773
02:28:54,017 --> 02:28:56,686
One more thing to seal the deal.

1774
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:57,896
What?

1775
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:04,736
We unplug. we unplug.

1776
02:30:28,486 --> 02:30:31,698
<i>What I've learned
is just how isolated I was</i>

1777
02:30:31,781 --> 02:30:33,199
<i>before all this happened.</i>

1778
02:30:34,075 --> 02:30:35,618
<i>I love the quiet.</i>

1779
02:30:35,702 --> 02:30:37,454
<i>I love being
with my own thoughts,</i>

1780
02:30:37,537 --> 02:30:40,582
<i>keeping my own counsel,
not racing around.</i>

1781
02:30:40,749 --> 02:30:45,670
<i>I have so much time.
It's such a relief.</i>

1782
02:30:46,546 --> 02:30:48,465
<i>What was I rushing around
for before?</i>

1783
02:30:48,548 --> 02:30:50,154
<i>There's nothing to do.</i>

1784
02:30:50,155 --> 02:30:51,864
<i>I owe my mother a call.</i>

1785
02:30:51,865 --> 02:30:53,928
<i>It's been weeks,
and she's all alone.</i>

1786
02:30:59,392 --> 02:31:01,144
Loneliness is the central

1787
02:31:01,145 --> 02:31:04,189
and inevitable fact
of human existence.

1788
02:31:28,463 --> 02:31:31,757
<i>Someone is at my door,
who is it?</i>

1789
02:31:31,758 --> 02:31:36,763
<i>It's the mailman. He's a nice
simple guy with a crush on me.</i>

1790
02:31:37,931 --> 02:31:40,642
<i>Talks to me about World Cup
soccer sometimes.</i>

1791
02:31:40,643 --> 02:31:42,456
<i>Maybe I could ask him
for a coffee,</i>

1792
02:31:42,457 --> 02:31:44,020
<i>take things from there.</i>

1793
02:31:44,145 --> 02:31:46,940
<i>Would I feel guilty
if everyone's packages were late</i>

1794
02:31:47,023 --> 02:31:49,859
<i>because I started a torrid
affair with the mailman?</i>

1795
02:31:49,943 --> 02:31:52,070
<i>It could be awkward
if it didn't go well.</i>

1796
02:31:59,494 --> 02:32:02,831
<i>My mind was always
racing before.</i>

1797
02:32:03,873 --> 02:32:05,583
<i>So many deadlines.</i>

1798
02:32:07,043 --> 02:32:09,004
<i>Now it's calm.</i>

1799
02:32:12,132 --> 02:32:14,634
<i>It's because of the amount
of sleep I've been getting.</i>

1800
02:32:14,718 --> 02:32:18,138
<i>Not setting the alarm in the
morning is the greatest gift.</i>

1801
02:32:24,352 --> 02:32:26,396
<i>I should have gotten a dog,</i>

1802
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:27,898
<i>even a rescue dog.</i>

1803
02:32:27,899 --> 02:32:31,067
<i>But some of them are so crazy,
like that lady</i>

1804
02:32:31,151 --> 02:32:33,129
<i>that comes by the public pool
with that dog that barks</i>

1805
02:32:33,153 --> 02:32:35,572
<i>at anyone who tries to swim.
What a nightmare.</i>

1806
02:32:36,448 --> 02:32:38,158
<i>I'm so horny.</i>

1807
02:32:38,241 --> 02:32:40,910
<i>I shouldn't have broken up with
my boyfriend before all this.</i>

1808
02:32:40,911 --> 02:32:42,370
<i>I blame myself.</i>

1809
02:32:43,413 --> 02:32:45,206
<i>I miss my housekeeper.</i>

1810
02:32:46,833 --> 02:32:48,626
<i>I wish something would happen.</i>

1811
02:34:28,685 --> 02:34:30,604
I've killed two people today.

1812
02:34:30,605 --> 02:34:32,814
One more makes zero difference.

1813
02:34:34,441 --> 02:34:35,441
Don't scream.

1814
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:47,579
Ah!

1815
02:34:53,710 --> 02:34:55,628
<i>Issued a stern
warning to neighbors</i>

1816
02:34:55,712 --> 02:34:57,964
<i>in the immediate vicinity
of Green Valley</i>

1817
02:34:58,048 --> 02:35:01,134
<i>to be on high alert and on
the lookout for escaped inmate,</i>

1818
02:35:01,135 --> 02:35:03,094
<i>Paula Mariah Roback,</i>

1819
02:35:03,178 --> 02:35:05,972
<i>who is unstable, violent,
and extremely dangerous.</i>

1820
02:35:05,973 --> 02:35:08,808
<i>Sheriff Prosky begged
the public not to try</i>

1821
02:35:08,892 --> 02:35:10,643
<i>and take matters
into their own hands,</i>

1822
02:35:10,727 --> 02:35:12,729
<i>but rather call
the office immediately</i>

1823
02:35:12,812 --> 02:35:14,356
<i>so they can apprehend
the suspect</i>

1824
02:35:14,439 --> 02:35:16,232
<i>without further bloodshed.</i>

1825
02:35:16,316 --> 02:35:18,693
<i>Paula Mariah Roback has a long
and terrifying history...</i>

1826
02:35:20,487 --> 02:35:21,967
<i>harkening back
to her early teens...</i>

1827
02:35:30,246 --> 02:35:32,498
You call me that, I'll hurt you.

1828
02:35:32,499 --> 02:35:33,875
Understand?

1829
02:35:38,421 --> 02:35:41,841
My mother was a tone-deaf
ho bag with no taste.

1830
02:35:41,925 --> 02:35:43,426
Couldn't decide
who she liked better,

1831
02:35:43,427 --> 02:35:45,178
Paula Abdul or Mariah Carey.

1832
02:35:45,179 --> 02:35:47,764
So I was stuck
with a shit childhood.

1833
02:35:47,847 --> 02:35:49,575
And learned to mop the floor
with lippy bitches

1834
02:35:49,599 --> 02:35:51,518
before I learned to read.

1835
02:35:51,601 --> 02:35:54,187
Came up with my own brand
of super karate.

1836
02:35:55,313 --> 02:35:56,773
My whole life I've been
fighting,

1837
02:35:56,856 --> 02:35:59,046
so that's what my identity
is based on.

1838
02:35:59,047 --> 02:36:02,112
That's what the nice lady shrink
keeps reminding me.

1839
02:36:08,493 --> 02:36:11,579
What's your name?

1840
02:36:12,247 --> 02:36:13,581
Leslie?

1841
02:36:16,543 --> 02:36:18,441
- Are you gonna scream again?
- Mm-mm.

1842
02:36:18,442 --> 02:36:20,338
- Are you lying?
- Mm-mm.

1843
02:36:26,970 --> 02:36:28,096
Well?

1844
02:36:29,055 --> 02:36:30,181
What?

1845
02:36:31,891 --> 02:36:33,018
What's your name?

1846
02:36:34,894 --> 02:36:35,978
Ivy.

1847
02:36:35,979 --> 02:36:37,938
That's your Christian name?

1848
02:36:37,939 --> 02:36:39,232
No.

1849
02:36:39,315 --> 02:36:40,900
What'd your parents call you?

1850
02:36:41,609 --> 02:36:42,944
Yvonne.

1851
02:36:43,486 --> 02:36:45,238
What I mean right there.

1852
02:36:45,239 --> 02:36:47,866
Yvonne sounds like a brand
of tampon.

1853
02:36:48,742 --> 02:36:51,119
School was no walk in the park
for you, I bet.

1854
02:36:52,746 --> 02:36:54,039
I borrowed your dress.

1855
02:36:55,582 --> 02:36:57,375
Smells really good.

1856
02:37:10,597 --> 02:37:13,350
The only good thing to come out
of all this is that you can go

1857
02:37:13,433 --> 02:37:15,161
anywhere wearing a mask,
and nobody knows you're there

1858
02:37:15,185 --> 02:37:16,770
to rob them
'til the last second.

1859
02:37:16,853 --> 02:37:18,813
That's the only thing
I'm gonna miss.

1860
02:37:19,230 --> 02:37:22,359
You know gun shops are
on the essential list now?

1861
02:37:22,442 --> 02:37:23,735
Sex shops too.

1862
02:37:24,611 --> 02:37:26,488
Someone has their priorities
straight.

1863
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:28,656
Do you have a gun?

1864
02:37:29,783 --> 02:37:31,618
What am I asking,
of course you don't.

1865
02:37:31,619 --> 02:37:34,537
If you had a gun, you never
would have faced an intruder

1866
02:37:34,621 --> 02:37:36,081
with an umbrella.

1867
02:37:40,543 --> 02:37:42,337
How was that supposed to work?

1868
02:37:42,338 --> 02:37:45,548
You're gonna stick the umbrella
up the guy's ass

1869
02:37:45,632 --> 02:37:48,510
and press the button, hoping it
opened and paralyzed him?

1870
02:37:48,511 --> 02:37:49,719
Hmm?

1871
02:37:52,055 --> 02:37:54,556
I wasn't thinking.

1872
02:37:54,557 --> 02:37:55,975
No kidding.

1873
02:38:00,563 --> 02:38:02,816
Little home protection
goes a long way.

1874
02:38:16,121 --> 02:38:18,747
You can't keep me tied up
like this.

1875
02:38:18,748 --> 02:38:20,750
People will come looking for me.

1876
02:38:20,834 --> 02:38:23,253
- What people?
- People.

1877
02:38:23,336 --> 02:38:24,814
Just because you're alone
in the world

1878
02:38:24,838 --> 02:38:26,444
doesn't mean I don't have
any friends.

1879
02:38:26,445 --> 02:38:29,009
You don't have to be
a dick about it.

1880
02:38:29,092 --> 02:38:32,012
My arms are numb.
I can't feel my wrists.

1881
02:38:32,013 --> 02:38:34,139
I have no blood circulation.

1882
02:38:34,931 --> 02:38:36,975
I get sad when it rains.

1883
02:38:37,308 --> 02:38:42,022
Having a rough life is no excuse
to go around terrorizing people.

1884
02:38:42,105 --> 02:38:44,024
What do you know about rough?

1885
02:38:44,107 --> 02:38:45,900
I have a lot you don't know
about me.

1886
02:38:45,984 --> 02:38:48,111
Like what? One thing.

1887
02:38:51,406 --> 02:38:53,867
Were you raised dirt poor
on a farm?

1888
02:38:53,950 --> 02:38:55,535
What if I was?

1889
02:38:55,618 --> 02:38:56,745
So was I.

1890
02:38:58,121 --> 02:39:00,206
Did your mother die in
a gruesome tractor accident

1891
02:39:00,207 --> 02:39:03,376
with your dad behind the wheel
because they were both drunk?

1892
02:39:04,753 --> 02:39:07,380
Did your one-armed uncle
smuggle cigarettes

1893
02:39:07,464 --> 02:39:09,654
and moonshine on a speed boat?

1894
02:39:09,655 --> 02:39:12,051
There was a speed boat
on a farm?

1895
02:39:12,052 --> 02:39:14,179
The farm was next to a lake.

1896
02:39:15,722 --> 02:39:19,392
It's like they say, "Truth is
stranger than fiction."

1897
02:39:19,393 --> 02:39:21,644
Come on, don't give me that.

1898
02:39:21,728 --> 02:39:24,189
Of course truth is stranger
than fiction.

1899
02:39:25,315 --> 02:39:26,941
Fiction has to make sense.

1900
02:39:28,234 --> 02:39:30,779
I'm not here
for your entertainment.

1901
02:39:31,654 --> 02:39:32,947
Stay focused.

1902
02:40:06,272 --> 02:40:09,025
I am so sorry that took longer
than I meant.

1903
02:40:09,109 --> 02:40:11,820
Oh, my God, are you all right?

1904
02:40:21,204 --> 02:40:22,747
I am so sorry.

1905
02:40:24,374 --> 02:40:26,209
I know what it feels like to be
left betrayed,

1906
02:40:26,292 --> 02:40:28,086
abandoned, and humiliated.

1907
02:40:29,379 --> 02:40:32,257
When I was 12, I was abducted by
a white supremacist biker gang

1908
02:40:32,258 --> 02:40:33,675
of Satan worshipers,

1909
02:40:34,718 --> 02:40:37,971
The nice lady shrink says all my
traumas stem from that moment.

1910
02:40:38,054 --> 02:40:40,682
The fabric of my reality
was torn or something.

1911
02:40:41,182 --> 02:40:44,477
They meant to use me
in a blood sacrifice ritual

1912
02:40:44,561 --> 02:40:46,229
and tied me up
to this makeshift altar

1913
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:50,108
and lit this big bonfire where
they intended to cook me.

1914
02:40:51,735 --> 02:40:53,861
I remember trembling,

1915
02:40:53,862 --> 02:40:57,532
my whole body just vibrating,
almost levitating.

1916
02:40:58,742 --> 02:41:02,370
And I suppose I went
into a trance.

1917
02:41:02,746 --> 02:41:08,250
My mind went blank and focused
on one simple thought,

1918
02:41:08,251 --> 02:41:11,546
complete and total annihilation.

1919
02:41:13,173 --> 02:41:15,800
This staggering feat
of derring-do,

1920
02:41:15,884 --> 02:41:18,178
one shell-shocked 12-year-old
versus five twisted

1921
02:41:18,261 --> 02:41:21,097
and depraved white
supremacist Satan worshipers

1922
02:41:21,181 --> 02:41:24,684
was reported on the news
by this nasty blonde bitch

1923
02:41:24,768 --> 02:41:27,354
who never quit smiling
as she described the way

1924
02:41:27,437 --> 02:41:32,901
that I massacred, with my bare
little hands, those evil bikers.

1925
02:41:33,860 --> 02:41:39,991
Which is why I can't stand
the news, or Nazis,

1926
02:41:41,284 --> 02:41:45,163
or heavy metal bands,
or motorcycles.

1927
02:41:47,707 --> 02:41:49,584
Which is why I broke your TV.

1928
02:41:50,794 --> 02:41:52,337
I'm sorry for that.

1929
02:42:25,745 --> 02:42:27,038
Ha!

1930
02:42:32,043 --> 02:42:33,169
Oh...

1931
02:42:35,255 --> 02:42:38,091
I got to say, most women
don't look great in that,

1932
02:42:38,092 --> 02:42:39,342
but you do.

1933
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:43,638
Seriously, plus you have
amazing boobs.

1934
02:42:44,931 --> 02:42:48,226
Come on, you never wanted
to be someone's love slave?

1935
02:42:49,269 --> 02:42:51,771
All women like a little rough
trade from time to time.

1936
02:42:53,523 --> 02:42:56,651
Hmm. We're all getting
a little testy.

1937
02:42:57,986 --> 02:43:02,073
Boy, I'm sweating like a nun
in a cucumber field.

1938
02:43:04,534 --> 02:43:06,578
You want to play
20 questions with me?

1939
02:43:09,706 --> 02:43:12,375
Who's that?

1940
02:43:18,631 --> 02:43:20,382
Who is that?

1941
02:43:20,383 --> 02:43:21,967
The mailman.

1942
02:43:21,968 --> 02:43:24,095
Why is he knocking on your door?

1943
02:43:24,971 --> 02:43:27,057
He must need something signed.

1944
02:43:29,017 --> 02:43:30,227
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

1945
02:43:30,228 --> 02:43:31,603
I don't mean to bother you,

1946
02:43:31,604 --> 02:43:33,229
but did I drop off a package

1947
02:43:33,313 --> 02:43:35,607
for 513 here yesterday
by mistake?

1948
02:43:36,274 --> 02:43:38,317
- No.
- Oh.

1949
02:43:38,318 --> 02:43:40,820
Also, I know you get this
all the time,

1950
02:43:40,821 --> 02:43:42,864
but I'm a huge fan of your work.

1951
02:43:49,287 --> 02:43:50,413
Excuse me?

1952
02:43:54,376 --> 02:43:55,794
Thanks so much.

1953
02:44:15,438 --> 02:44:17,399
You shouldn't have done that.

1954
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:19,525
What do you think I did?

1955
02:44:19,526 --> 02:44:21,027
Something funny.

1956
02:44:21,528 --> 02:44:23,445
Did you do something funny?

1957
02:44:23,446 --> 02:44:25,197
No.

1958
02:44:25,198 --> 02:44:28,450
Were you a bad little bunny,
Yvonne?

1959
02:44:28,451 --> 02:44:29,744
No.

1960
02:44:30,036 --> 02:44:32,664
Did you maybe ask the mailman
for help?

1961
02:44:34,290 --> 02:44:35,583
No.

1962
02:44:48,304 --> 02:44:50,056
I wasn't born yesterday.

1963
02:45:26,593 --> 02:45:28,386
<i>I'm a little lost.</i>

1964
02:45:28,470 --> 02:45:31,264
<i>I don't understand the things
happening around me.</i>

1965
02:45:31,265 --> 02:45:33,996
<i>I have experience,
but little wisdom.</i>

1966
02:45:33,997 --> 02:45:36,353
<i>This in itself
is not unheard of.</i>

1967
02:45:36,354 --> 02:45:39,189
<i>I've been told this as a sign
of the times,</i>

1968
02:45:39,272 --> 02:45:42,233
<i>a by-product of the hostile
world we live in,</i>

1969
02:45:42,234 --> 02:45:44,319
<i>a world adrift.</i>

1970
02:45:44,486 --> 02:45:46,946
<i>It doesn't make me feel better
about it,</i>

1971
02:45:46,947 --> 02:45:49,282
<i>but I don't want to give up yet,</i>

1972
02:45:49,283 --> 02:45:51,868
<i>even if no one sings me
love songs,</i>

1973
02:45:51,951 --> 02:45:53,870
<i>even If I don't yet have
a convincing beginning</i>

1974
02:45:53,953 --> 02:45:55,288
<i>for my new novel.</i>

1975
02:45:59,250 --> 02:46:01,795
<i>♪ Let me kiss ya ♪</i>

1976
02:46:01,878 --> 02:46:04,506

1977
02:46:04,507 --> 02:46:06,675

02:46:08,969 --> 02:46:10,845

1983
02:46:18,186 --> 02:46:19,479
Hmm.

1984
02:46:26,403 --> 02:46:28,488
<i>I want to live.</i>

1985
02:46:28,571 --> 02:46:32,658
<i>I want to bloom like a flower
and touch other people,</i>

1986
02:46:32,659 --> 02:46:35,745
<i>strangers. Touch their faces</i>

1987
02:46:35,829 --> 02:46:40,834
<i>and their hands and hug them
dangerously tight.</i>

1988
02:48:49,879 --> 02:48:52,631
This feels special.

1989
02:49:02,058 --> 02:49:04,019
We should do it more often.

1990
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:12,235
Is it?

1991
02:49:13,236 --> 02:49:14,863
It is to me.

1992
02:49:17,907 --> 02:49:19,743
I'd like do it more often.

1993
02:49:21,536 --> 02:49:23,246
Me too.

1994
02:49:23,329 --> 02:49:25,457
It's so nice without screens.

1995
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:28,043
Mm.

1996
02:49:36,926 --> 02:49:38,553
That reminds me,

1997
02:49:44,851 --> 02:49:46,686
I have a Zoom at 7:00.

1998
02:49:48,772 --> 02:49:50,731
I should just...

1999
02:49:50,732 --> 02:49:53,568
check if people replied.
Can we not?

2000
02:49:53,943 --> 02:49:56,071
Can we just carry on with this,

2001
02:49:56,946 --> 02:49:58,490
you know, the specialness?

2002
02:50:00,784 --> 02:50:02,494
- While it's still...
- Special?

2003
02:50:05,663 --> 02:50:06,790
Right.

2004
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:25,600
Can you not do that?

2005
02:50:25,934 --> 02:50:27,894
- What?
- With your foot.

2006
02:50:27,895 --> 02:50:30,397
- I was here first.
- What difference does that make?

2007
02:50:30,398 --> 02:50:32,170
So I can move
my foot where I like.

2008
02:50:32,171 --> 02:50:33,963
Not if I'm here now.
I'm here now

2009
02:50:33,964 --> 02:50:35,902
and I don't want
your foot invading my space.

2010
02:50:35,903 --> 02:50:37,445
It was my space before you came.

2011
02:50:37,446 --> 02:50:39,321
I had all of the space.

2012
02:50:39,322 --> 02:50:42,138
Then you came and occupied it
and took my space

2013
02:50:42,139 --> 02:50:44,202
that I had saved
for moving my foot into.

2014
02:50:44,203 --> 02:50:47,122
- You sound like Israel.
- Can you please move it?

2015
02:50:47,205 --> 02:50:48,623
Maybe it's Palestine.

2016
02:50:50,125 --> 02:50:51,334
Maybe it's Palestine.

2017
02:50:51,335 --> 02:50:53,211
It feels like it was originally
their space.

2018
02:50:53,212 --> 02:50:56,006
- You have to share the space.
- Says the UN.

2019
02:50:56,007 --> 02:50:57,298
Please move it.

2020
02:51:02,012 --> 02:51:04,179
Ow! Your nails are so sharp.

2021
02:51:04,180 --> 02:51:06,099
- Israel!
- No, you're Israel.

2022
02:51:06,100 --> 02:51:07,601
I thought you said
I was Palestine.

2023
02:51:07,602 --> 02:51:09,310
Can you please just both stop.

2024
02:51:10,186 --> 02:51:11,417
This was special.

2025
02:51:11,418 --> 02:51:13,606
Can we just keep it that way
for a minute

2026
02:51:13,607 --> 02:51:17,526
before we start invading each
other or...

2027
02:51:17,527 --> 02:51:20,030
Take up more space than we need?

2028
02:51:20,113 --> 02:51:22,866
Or start coming in and taking
over perfectly happy people.

2029
02:51:22,867 --> 02:51:24,409
Dad?

2030
02:51:24,492 --> 02:51:26,494
Please, both of you
can we not just all...

2031
02:51:30,373 --> 02:51:34,794
Try and find a two
cushion solution, please.

2032
02:51:40,050 --> 02:51:41,426
Dad?

2033
02:51:44,137 --> 02:51:45,430
Dad?

2034
02:51:45,513 --> 02:51:47,515
Yes. What? I'm right here.

2035
02:51:47,516 --> 02:51:49,601
- Is she Israel?
- If you've got something to ask,

2036
02:51:49,602 --> 02:51:51,728
you don't always need to keep
saying "Dad,"

2037
02:51:51,811 --> 02:51:55,190
you have my attention just by
talking without always...

2038
02:52:02,530 --> 02:52:03,823
Dad?

2039
02:52:05,116 --> 02:52:06,785
Sorry, I did not mean
to do that.

2040
02:52:06,786 --> 02:52:08,328
Say "Dad," I mean.

2041
02:52:08,411 --> 02:52:11,206
- He-he.
- You be quiet.

2042
02:52:17,337 --> 02:52:20,194
Dad, sorry, is she Israel
if I was here first?

2043
02:52:20,195 --> 02:52:21,841
Stop calling me Israel.

2044
02:52:21,925 --> 02:52:23,635
You don't even know
what it means.

2045
02:52:23,718 --> 02:52:26,805
It means that...

2046
02:52:27,180 --> 02:52:29,808
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stop antagonizing.

2047
02:52:29,809 --> 02:52:31,016
I want to learn.

2048
02:52:31,017 --> 02:52:33,937
Ow, you scratched me again.

2049
02:52:34,020 --> 02:52:36,605
Ow!
You space-invading poupon jar.

2050
02:52:36,606 --> 02:52:39,024
Okay, okay.
You come over here.

2051
02:52:39,025 --> 02:52:42,237
- Why do I have to move?
- Just please come here.

2052
02:52:57,252 --> 02:52:58,336
Daddy?

2053
02:52:58,795 --> 02:53:01,714
- Hmm?
- Am I Israel?

2054
02:53:01,715 --> 02:53:05,259
No. Honestly, I don't know.

2055
02:53:05,260 --> 02:53:07,929
She can say "Daddy,"
but I can't.

2056
02:53:08,013 --> 02:53:09,723
Can you stop, please?

2057
02:53:13,309 --> 02:53:15,061
Now, I think I got myself

2058
02:53:15,145 --> 02:53:17,022
in a bit of a muddle
with this one.

2059
02:53:17,897 --> 02:53:19,024
Um...

2060
02:53:20,358 --> 02:53:23,820
I think both Israel
and Palestine

2061
02:53:24,362 --> 02:53:26,614
think that
they were there first.

2062
02:53:28,908 --> 02:53:30,201
I think.

2063
02:53:34,497 --> 02:53:35,623
Are you okay?

2064
02:53:35,707 --> 02:53:36,833
Are you okay, Mom?

2065
02:53:37,375 --> 02:53:39,169
It's pretty complicated.

2066
02:53:39,252 --> 02:53:40,587
I'm sorry.

2067
02:53:45,759 --> 02:53:46,926
It's not you.

2068
02:53:47,010 --> 02:53:48,553
Oh, love.

2069
02:53:55,018 --> 02:53:56,811
Oh, darling.

2070
02:54:05,945 --> 02:54:07,465
I was just reading
this beautiful thing

2071
02:54:07,530 --> 02:54:09,157
about someone dying alone.

2072
02:54:11,910 --> 02:54:15,038
Their family isn't allowed to be
with them and...

2073
02:54:17,499 --> 02:54:20,710
I just got scared for that
ever happening to us.

2074
02:54:20,711 --> 02:54:22,253
The people we love.

2075
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:28,426
To...

2076
02:54:30,970 --> 02:54:32,346
to my dad.

2077
02:54:32,347 --> 02:54:34,766
- Or Granny.
- Or Granny.

2078
02:54:38,311 --> 02:54:40,814
What about when Granny
was a little girl

2079
02:54:40,897 --> 02:54:43,608
all alone in the hospital
with Scarlet Fever.

2080
02:54:45,151 --> 02:54:47,112
What was she, eight?

2081
02:54:47,195 --> 02:54:48,321
Six, I think.

2082
02:54:48,405 --> 02:54:50,906
Six, isolated for six months.

2083
02:54:50,907 --> 02:54:53,493
- I think it was eight.
- Oh, whatever.

2084
02:54:53,576 --> 02:54:55,787
All that time on her own.

2085
02:54:55,870 --> 02:55:00,083
Her mom and dad waving at her
through a window and a door.

2086
02:55:01,793 --> 02:55:03,878
Terrified all the time.

2087
02:55:08,174 --> 02:55:10,468
And if we ever
had to mourn alone,

2088
02:55:11,428 --> 02:55:12,846
separately, not together,

2089
02:55:12,929 --> 02:55:14,556
I don't think I could take it.

2090
02:55:15,765 --> 02:55:19,978
All the things we do when
someone dies, we do together.

2091
02:55:22,105 --> 02:55:24,649
Talk, drink.

2092
02:55:28,695 --> 02:55:32,115
Tell stories,
hold someone's hand.

2093
02:55:44,878 --> 02:55:46,713
Actually, this is getting
a little uncomfortable.

2094
02:55:46,714 --> 02:55:48,006
Do you think you could get off?

2095
02:55:48,089 --> 02:55:50,008
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay.

2096
02:55:51,926 --> 02:55:54,137
Ooh, I've got a great idea.

2097
02:55:54,220 --> 02:55:57,766
Hey Siri, play "Alexandra"
by Hamilton Leithauser.

2098
02:55:57,767 --> 02:55:59,851

Did he actually just say that?

2123
02:58:22,035 --> 02:58:23,745
Are you kidding me?

2124
02:58:23,828 --> 02:58:27,540
Does he really believe that?
Did you hear that?

2125
02:58:28,416 --> 02:58:30,793
Ugh, it's a Washington
death cult.

2126
02:58:30,794 --> 02:58:32,525
It's just about science.

2127
02:58:32,526 --> 02:58:34,214
Why won't they listen to
science?

2128
02:58:36,091 --> 02:58:37,092
Did he just say that?

2129
02:58:39,719 --> 02:58:43,223
Look, look, that's the hospital
where Ben was born.

2130
02:58:43,224 --> 02:58:45,642
Lousy parking.

2131
02:58:48,978 --> 02:58:50,146
Hi, Dad.

2132
02:58:52,565 --> 02:58:54,191
Sorry. The TV is on

2133
02:58:54,192 --> 02:58:57,404
and Ben's playing his guitar.
Are you all right?

2134
02:58:57,487 --> 02:58:59,573
<i>The reported
coronavirus death toll in the...</i>

2135
02:58:59,574 --> 02:59:01,491
- I should have stayed.
- Shh!

2136
02:59:01,574 --> 02:59:02,972
<i>Whether the number of deaths</i>

2137
02:59:02,973 --> 02:59:04,953
<i>has been over-counted.
Of course, that would fly</i>

2138
02:59:05,036 --> 02:59:06,663
<i>in the face
of Dr. Fauci's testimony...</i>

2139
02:59:06,746 --> 02:59:08,665
No, Dad, please use your walker.

2140
02:59:08,666 --> 02:59:10,333
We want to come get you,

2141
02:59:10,417 --> 02:59:12,127
but you gotta
let your hip heal first

2142
02:59:12,210 --> 02:59:14,421
so you got to move
every day only with your walker

2143
02:59:14,422 --> 02:59:16,381
- and only with your...
- Are you seeing this?

2144
02:59:16,382 --> 02:59:17,903
They don't even have a plan!

2145
02:59:17,904 --> 02:59:19,634
If you do that,
you're going to fall again

2146
02:59:19,635 --> 02:59:21,261
and if you fall again...

2147
02:59:21,344 --> 02:59:23,471
No, Dad, that's why you can't
fire Kimmy.

2148
02:59:23,472 --> 02:59:25,348
Doctors say one thing and then...

2149
02:59:25,432 --> 02:59:27,308
Matt, please.

2150
02:59:28,268 --> 02:59:30,687
Ben. Ben.

2151
02:59:31,604 --> 02:59:33,523
That's our home, Ben.

2152
02:59:33,606 --> 02:59:35,442
We have to pay attention.

2153
02:59:38,361 --> 02:59:40,154
No. Dad, Dad,

2154
02:59:40,155 --> 02:59:43,199
you're not listening to me.
If you do that...

2155
02:59:43,283 --> 02:59:45,410
Ben. Ben.

2156
02:59:46,286 --> 02:59:48,872
No, Dad. No, please.

2157
02:59:48,955 --> 02:59:50,186
Hang on a second.

2158
02:59:50,187 --> 02:59:52,125
We should go with him.
He might get lost.

2159
02:59:52,208 --> 02:59:54,669
I'll call you back
after your nap, Dad.

2160
03:00:04,220 --> 03:00:05,638
He's pissed, isn't he?

2161
03:00:05,639 --> 03:00:08,558
So am I. I hate it here.

2162
03:00:09,434 --> 03:00:11,269
Coyotes at night freak me out.

2163
03:00:12,479 --> 03:00:14,397
My dad's gonna fall again.

2164
03:00:14,481 --> 03:00:15,899
Where's he going?

2165
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:19,027
I don't know, maybe
he's walking back to the city.

2166
03:00:19,903 --> 03:00:21,258
My back is killing me.

2167
03:00:21,259 --> 03:00:24,157
I think the mattress in that
place is from the 1950s.

2168
03:00:24,158 --> 03:00:25,513
Stop complaining.

2169
03:00:25,514 --> 03:00:27,494
I think the plumbing
is from the '50s too.

2170
03:00:27,577 --> 03:00:29,371
Do you think Ben seems anxious?

2171
03:00:29,454 --> 03:00:30,996
No. He seems pissed.

2172
03:00:30,997 --> 03:00:33,249
You're the one
who seems anxious.

2173
03:00:33,333 --> 03:00:35,251
Well, I am anxious about my dad.

2174
03:00:35,335 --> 03:00:36,753
Kimmy says
his feet are getting worse.

2175
03:00:36,754 --> 03:00:38,421
If we go back
you can see your dad.

2176
03:00:37,796 --> 03:00:40,507
I don't want to go back.
How can we use the elevator?

2177
03:00:40,590 --> 03:00:42,676
How can Ben see his friends?
You know he'll want to see

2178
03:00:42,677 --> 03:00:44,803
his friends. You wanna open
that Pandora's box?

2179
03:00:44,886 --> 03:00:46,596
- But your dad...
- Don't use my guilt

2180
03:00:46,597 --> 03:00:48,515
about my dad to get me
to go back right now.

2181
03:00:48,516 --> 03:00:50,684
- That is not fair.
- Don't be so defensive.

2182
03:00:50,685 --> 03:00:52,310
I'm not being defensive.

2183
03:00:52,394 --> 03:00:54,271
Look, we can't stay here
forever.

2184
03:00:54,272 --> 03:00:56,272
Henry's gonna start charging
us rent

2185
03:00:56,356 --> 03:00:57,774
as soon as the state reopens.

2186
03:00:57,775 --> 03:01:00,777
- He's doing us a favor.
- So we pay.

2187
03:01:00,860 --> 03:01:02,007
Are you kidding me?

2188
03:01:02,008 --> 03:01:03,863
We can barely afford our rent
back home.

2189
03:01:03,864 --> 03:01:06,157
We need to start getting better
about food.

2190
03:01:08,201 --> 03:01:09,744
What?

2191
03:01:09,828 --> 03:01:11,287
His teeth are hurting,
he broke his braces.

2192
03:01:11,288 --> 03:01:12,664
I know that.

2193
03:01:12,747 --> 03:01:14,416
So I'll take him back
to the city.

2194
03:01:13,748 --> 03:01:16,042
And then the orthodontist sticks
his hands in his mouth?

2195
03:01:16,043 --> 03:01:17,502
Do you know how unsafe that is?

2196
03:01:17,503 --> 03:01:19,796
We spent a lot of money
on those braces.

2197
03:01:19,879 --> 03:01:21,026
We can't start over again.

2198
03:01:21,027 --> 03:01:23,008
Why do you keep making this
all about money?

2199
03:01:23,009 --> 03:01:25,093
Why won't you acknowledge that
it's an issue?

2200
03:01:24,426 --> 03:01:27,053
If you'd have taken that
transfer six months ago,

2201
03:01:27,137 --> 03:01:28,388
you wouldn't have been laid off
right now.

2202
03:01:28,389 --> 03:01:29,577
Sorry. How could I see

2203
03:01:29,578 --> 03:01:31,516
that the world was
about to implode?

2204
03:01:31,599 --> 03:01:33,101
It's an emergency.
It's his health, like your dad.

2205
03:01:33,102 --> 03:01:34,894
- Don't.
- So I'll take him alone.

2206
03:01:34,978 --> 03:01:36,354
And then we're separated?

2207
03:01:37,814 --> 03:01:39,044
No.

2208
03:01:39,045 --> 03:01:42,027
Ben, you have to tell us how bad
your teeth...

2209
03:01:44,154 --> 03:01:45,613
Where is he?

2210
03:01:46,656 --> 03:01:47,949
Ben?

2211
03:01:48,658 --> 03:01:50,035
Ben?

2212
03:01:52,537 --> 03:01:53,663
Ben!

2213
03:01:59,502 --> 03:02:01,129
I'm right here.

2214
03:02:04,591 --> 03:02:05,884
Ben.

2215
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:15,643
Did we get too loud?

2216
03:02:17,604 --> 03:02:19,481
Now will you please be quiet?

2217
03:05:44,310 --> 03:05:45,979
Can you show me the way home?

2218
03:05:56,364 --> 03:05:58,658
<i>Questioning the accuracy...</i>

2219
03:05:58,742 --> 03:06:01,035
<i>Dad. Dad, please use
your walker.</i>

2220
03:06:01,036 --> 03:06:04,143
<i>Are you seeing this?
They don't even have beds.</i>

2221
03:06:04,144 --> 03:06:06,583
<i>Doctors
and scientists investigating</i>

2222
03:06:07,834 --> 03:06:11,338
<i>A mysterious illness

I have no idea.

♪ <i>She keeps crying

2232
03:07:33,192 --> 03:07:35,088
You know, I have been thinking

2233
03:07:35,171 --> 03:07:36,923
a lot about what you told me,

2234
03:07:36,924 --> 03:07:39,906
how like attracts like
and how the frequency

2235
03:07:39,907 --> 03:07:43,680
that you put out in the world
is what comes back at you,

2236
03:07:43,681 --> 03:07:45,390
and oh, my God.

2237
03:07:45,473 --> 03:07:47,100
That's disturbing.
I mean, this guy

2238
03:07:47,183 --> 03:07:48,685
is the most selfish
asshole I've ever met.

2239
03:07:48,686 --> 03:07:50,458
What does that say about me?

2240
03:07:50,459 --> 03:07:52,501
But you know, you know me,
I just have this thing

2241
03:07:52,502 --> 03:07:54,816
where I need to fix people.
I'm a fixer.

2242
03:07:54,817 --> 03:07:56,443
I don't know,
I see a fucked up guy

2243
03:07:56,444 --> 03:07:59,529
and I have this crazy impulse
to make him eggs.

2244
03:07:59,612 --> 03:08:01,364
Do you think Lester's
going to come back?

2245
03:08:01,448 --> 03:08:03,033
All right, no, don't answer.
I don't care.

2246
03:08:02,449 --> 03:08:04,388
I don't give a shit.
He shouldn't come back.

2247
03:08:04,389 --> 03:08:07,078
I don't care, right?
The guy is driving me crazy,

2248
03:08:07,079 --> 03:08:08,705
clearly, and it's just,

2249
03:08:08,788 --> 03:08:10,457
there's so much uncertainty
in the world.

2250
03:08:10,458 --> 03:08:12,709
Why do I even want him back
here? I don't know.

2251
03:08:12,710 --> 03:08:15,212
It's like there's some fucking
invisible cosmic noose

2252
03:08:15,213 --> 03:08:17,964
wrapped around my neck,
pulling me toward some sort

2253
03:08:18,048 --> 03:08:20,717
of form of punishment
or some sort of torture

2254
03:08:20,718 --> 03:08:26,097
or something and... I sound like
I'm a masochist, right?

2255
03:08:27,223 --> 03:08:30,060
I mean, we... we've established
that, right?

2256
03:08:30,143 --> 03:08:32,645
I mean, you... you don't think
I'm a masochist, do you?

2257
03:08:32,646 --> 03:08:35,648
Oh, no. I mean, you seem to
avoid pain at all costs.

2258
03:08:35,649 --> 03:08:37,400
Right. Exactly.

2259
03:08:38,360 --> 03:08:42,364
I mean, I don't understand
why I'm staying with this guy.

2260
03:08:42,365 --> 03:08:44,324
Why do I keep going back to him?

2261
03:08:44,407 --> 03:08:46,159
It's like, why be with someone
who doesn't treat me

2262
03:08:46,160 --> 03:08:47,952
the way I deserve to be treated?

2263
03:08:51,581 --> 03:08:54,501
It's the age old question,

2264
03:08:54,584 --> 03:08:57,419
right behind, why are we here?

2265
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:59,964
What is our purpose in life?

2266
03:09:02,342 --> 03:09:04,177
Why do I stay with this guy?

2267
03:09:08,765 --> 03:09:11,017
My God, I sound
like such a cliché.

2268
03:09:11,101 --> 03:09:13,603
Really? I mean,
this is embarrassing.

2269
03:09:13,604 --> 03:09:15,209
You tell me to be authentic.

2270
03:09:15,210 --> 03:09:17,857
You say I can say absolutely
anything I want to.

2271
03:09:17,858 --> 03:09:18,983
So, here you go.

2272
03:09:19,067 --> 03:09:20,443
But really, truly, I mean,

2273
03:09:20,527 --> 03:09:22,320
honestly, I just...
I feel ashamed.

2274
03:09:22,404 --> 03:09:24,256
I should be so much further
along than I am right now.

2275
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:26,157
Don't be so hard on yourself.

2276
03:09:27,450 --> 03:09:30,829
Oh, my God. Did I tell you about
Saskatchewan?

2277
03:09:31,121 --> 03:09:33,581
I can't believe I didn't tell
you this.

2278
03:09:34,124 --> 03:09:36,041
This is exactly... Okay.

2279
03:09:36,042 --> 03:09:38,086
Remember when
I was in Saskatchewan

2280
03:09:38,087 --> 03:09:40,880
right before this whole
lockdown thing happened?

2281
03:09:40,881 --> 03:09:44,049
Well, I went to the Museum of...

2282
03:09:44,050 --> 03:09:46,010
um, Natural History of...

2283
03:09:46,011 --> 03:09:48,346
Or Science or Archaeology,
I don't know.

2284
03:09:48,347 --> 03:09:51,057
It was the only place that was
open on a Sunday.

2285
03:09:51,141 --> 03:09:53,536
And so I go there and I have to
tell you, like, all week long,

2286
03:09:53,560 --> 03:09:54,853
I was kind of freaking out

2287
03:09:54,936 --> 03:09:56,563
because that memory of my
sister,

2288
03:09:56,646 --> 03:09:58,273
remember the one that I'm, like,
pounding on the door,

2289
03:09:58,274 --> 03:10:00,233
pounding on the door,
pounding on the door,

2290
03:10:00,316 --> 03:10:02,131
like, let me in.
Like, let me in, let me in

2291
03:10:02,132 --> 03:10:04,988
and she's not letting me in
and listen,

2292
03:10:05,071 --> 03:10:06,906
I know we've been through this
ad nauseam.

2293
03:10:06,907 --> 03:10:09,013
Like, I get it.
She's not letting me in.

2294
03:10:09,014 --> 03:10:12,245
It's like the way this fuck face
isn't letting me in.

2295
03:10:12,328 --> 03:10:15,749
And I'm... Why do I need someone
to let me in?

2296
03:10:15,832 --> 03:10:18,460
Why can't
I let myself in, right?

2297
03:10:19,419 --> 03:10:21,588
I mean, sure,
she locks the door,

2298
03:10:21,589 --> 03:10:24,006
but why don't I just have a key?

2299
03:10:24,007 --> 03:10:25,174
If I have a key,

2300
03:10:25,175 --> 03:10:27,176
I can let myself in.

2301
03:10:27,177 --> 03:10:29,678
Anyway. So inside the building...

2302
03:10:29,679 --> 03:10:31,598
Inside the building,

2303
03:10:31,681 --> 03:10:34,434
there was a giant kaleidoscope,
okay?

2304
03:10:34,435 --> 03:10:37,854
And, like... You, like,
kind of... You walk in

2305
03:10:37,937 --> 03:10:40,982
and then under and then you're
inside the kaleidoscope.

2306
03:10:40,983 --> 03:10:43,860
Like, surrounded by all these
shattered lights,

2307
03:10:43,861 --> 03:10:45,862
all these fractured mirrors,

2308
03:10:45,945 --> 03:10:48,156
and somehow when I went
in there,

2309
03:10:48,157 --> 03:10:51,409
like, it hit me,
like, it hit me really hard.

2310
03:10:51,493 --> 03:10:53,203
I was weeping. I mean,

2311
03:10:53,286 --> 03:10:56,539
it felt so real that I could
feel how tense I was,

2312
03:10:56,540 --> 03:10:59,543
you know, how desperate I was to
get to the door.

2313
03:10:59,544 --> 03:11:02,483
And as I'm pounding on the door
to my sister, like, "Let me in."

2314
03:11:02,484 --> 03:11:04,881
It hit me so hard.
I mean, I don't know.

2315
03:11:04,964 --> 03:11:06,883
I mean, maybe it was the
mushrooms because I had taken

2316
03:11:06,216 --> 03:11:08,343
them right before I got there,
but I don't think so.

2317
03:11:08,344 --> 03:11:10,220
You know, it was more than that.

2318
03:11:10,303 --> 03:11:11,888
I think there was some little
thing that unlocked

2319
03:11:11,889 --> 03:11:13,932
this little gnat,
like, bugging me.

2320
03:11:14,015 --> 03:11:16,893
Why in my subconscious do I keep
thinking about this moment

2321
03:11:16,976 --> 03:11:18,895
that I'm pounding and pounding
and crying,

2322
03:11:18,896 --> 03:11:20,647
crying, and all of a sudden,

2323
03:11:20,648 --> 03:11:22,524
I saw the end of the scene.

2324
03:11:22,607 --> 03:11:24,192
She let me in,
but when she let me in,

2325
03:11:24,193 --> 03:11:25,423
she's really mean to me.

2326
03:11:25,424 --> 03:11:27,571
She was just like, "Oh,
if you come in,

2327
03:11:27,572 --> 03:11:29,280
"you have to do exactly
what I say,"

2328
03:11:29,281 --> 03:11:31,950
in this kind of really sadistic
sort of way.

2329
03:11:32,033 --> 03:11:33,743
But if it meant getting
into the room,

2330
03:11:33,744 --> 03:11:36,538
I had to take it.
I had to take it.

2331
03:11:36,871 --> 03:11:39,395
It just means, like, love,
you know,

2332
03:11:39,396 --> 03:11:44,295
goes hand in hand with being
treated like shit, I guess.

2333
03:11:44,629 --> 03:11:46,840
She represented love and safety

2334
03:11:46,841 --> 03:11:49,342
in a house
where no one was home.

2335
03:11:49,343 --> 03:11:53,013
You're scared and lonely
and seeking protection.

2336
03:11:53,096 --> 03:11:54,514
You took what was offered.

2337
03:11:54,515 --> 03:11:56,683
That... That's the seed of your
struggle right there.

2338
03:11:56,684 --> 03:12:00,145
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

2339
03:12:01,438 --> 03:12:02,897
It's pretty fucking heavy.

2340
03:12:03,940 --> 03:12:05,254
That's been your pattern.

2341
03:12:05,255 --> 03:12:06,922
And... And now that
you know that,

2342
03:12:06,923 --> 03:12:09,112
you don't want to reinforce
the pattern

2343
03:12:09,195 --> 03:12:12,949
by accepting the bad behavior
Les is offering you.

2344
03:12:13,033 --> 03:12:14,743
Mm. Right.

2345
03:12:16,703 --> 03:12:20,582
Whoa.
Whoa, I totally get this.

2346
03:12:21,958 --> 03:12:23,376
So if he comes back,

2347
03:12:23,460 --> 03:12:24,919
I should ask him to leave.

2348
03:12:27,881 --> 03:12:29,799
I don't want to be alone now.

2349
03:12:29,883 --> 03:12:31,468
Now's not the best time
for that.

2350
03:12:31,551 --> 03:12:35,138
Who wants that?
It's scary out there.

2351
03:12:35,221 --> 03:12:36,806
I mean, but his whole,

2352
03:12:36,890 --> 03:12:38,475
"Oh, I need some space" thing.

2353
03:12:38,476 --> 03:12:39,914
It's such bullshit.

2354
03:12:39,915 --> 03:12:42,645
"Oh, it's springtime.
I think I have to wander."

2355
03:12:42,729 --> 03:12:43,876
Fuck you.

2356
03:12:43,877 --> 03:12:46,274
And if he really loved me,
he would stay.

2357
03:12:47,484 --> 03:12:50,904
But if I really love myself,
I'd asked him to leave.

2358
03:12:51,154 --> 03:12:53,906
It's a confusing time
for everybody.

2359
03:12:53,907 --> 03:12:56,076
Shells were a sign.

2360
03:12:56,159 --> 03:12:57,285
What shells?

2361
03:12:57,660 --> 03:13:00,830
I didn't tell
you about the shells?

2362
03:13:03,917 --> 03:13:05,835
When it was finally okay
to go outside,

2363
03:13:05,919 --> 03:13:07,119
we decided to go to the beach,

2364
03:13:07,170 --> 03:13:08,546
you know, get some fresh air.

2365
03:13:08,630 --> 03:13:09,777
And on the shore,

2366
03:13:09,778 --> 03:13:13,093
I found the most amazing
open shells.

2367
03:13:13,176 --> 03:13:15,762
They look like these little
butterflies and, I don't know,

2368
03:13:15,845 --> 03:13:17,685
seemed like a...
A symbol of hope or something,

2369
03:13:17,764 --> 03:13:19,182
that maybe we've evolved,

2370
03:13:19,183 --> 03:13:21,976
turned into something
really wonderful.

2371
03:13:23,353 --> 03:13:25,772
But when I looked at them this
morning,

2372
03:13:25,773 --> 03:13:27,691
they'd all broken apart.

2373
03:13:27,774 --> 03:13:30,026
Oh, everything feels so scary
to me right now.

2374
03:13:30,027 --> 03:13:32,195
I just want to feel safe, loved.

2375
03:13:32,196 --> 03:13:34,405
Is that asking for too much?

2376
03:13:34,406 --> 03:13:36,741
And I know he's been
texting his ex.

2377
03:13:36,825 --> 03:13:38,034
How do you know that?

2378
03:13:38,118 --> 03:13:40,286
Because I heard her ding.

2379
03:13:40,370 --> 03:13:42,122
I know I could tell
her ding anywhere.

2380
03:13:42,205 --> 03:13:44,958
I mean, her ding lingers
like bad perfume.

2381
03:13:45,041 --> 03:13:46,501
Oh, yeah. It's definitely her.

2382
03:13:46,584 --> 03:13:48,461
And then when I confronted
him with it,

2383
03:13:48,545 --> 03:13:51,464
he totally tried to gaslight me,
told me that I was crazy.

2384
03:13:51,548 --> 03:13:53,133
- You're not crazy.
- I know I'm not crazy.

2385
03:13:53,134 --> 03:13:54,592
You're definitely not crazy.

2386
03:13:54,593 --> 03:13:55,698
I know.

2387
03:13:55,699 --> 03:13:57,178
You're the sanest person I know.

2388
03:13:57,179 --> 03:13:58,763
I know. I mean, I
caught him lying.

2389
03:13:58,764 --> 03:14:00,849
- Lying's not cool. Fuck him.
- Fuck him.

2390
03:14:01,891 --> 03:14:04,602
His smell changes when he lies.

2391
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:07,605
- Really?
- Yeah, and he shuffles

2392
03:14:07,689 --> 03:14:09,775
his feet when he feels guilty
about something.

2393
03:14:09,776 --> 03:14:13,966
Huh. How come you've never said
anything like that to me before?

2394
03:14:13,967 --> 03:14:15,739
I don't know,
You seemed to dig him.

2395
03:14:15,822 --> 03:14:17,782
I tried to be supportive.

2396
03:14:20,118 --> 03:14:23,747
Well, you know,

2397
03:14:23,830 --> 03:14:25,248
it is what it is.

2398
03:14:25,249 --> 03:14:29,002
I mean, it's good that we know
all this stuff, right?

2399
03:14:29,085 --> 03:14:31,296
I mean, it... it's sad,

2400
03:14:34,257 --> 03:14:38,845
but as they say, it's always
darkest before the dawn.

2401
03:14:38,928 --> 03:14:40,554
Hmm. That's the time

2402
03:14:40,555 --> 03:14:42,766
you like to eat
your crunchy cereal.

2403
03:14:45,685 --> 03:14:48,188
Why don't we get into bed
and watch C <i>hernobyl </i>again?

2404
03:14:48,271 --> 03:14:50,148
That always seems
to cheer you up.

2405
03:14:51,316 --> 03:14:54,569
Yeah, that sounds good.

2406
03:14:59,366 --> 03:15:02,035
Things will work out.

2407
03:15:02,535 --> 03:15:04,996
