1
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,548
Champagne time.

2
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:20,776
Carson. Carson. Carson.

3
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,332
Where's my woman?
Where's Rachel?

4
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,991
Have fun with the boys.

5
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,191
Come on, baby.
We can play teams.

6
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,631
They' be shirts.

7
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,002
We' be skins.

8
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,371
Take it off! Take it off!

9
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,806
Take it off!

10
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,862
Carson, Carson.

11
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,625
You're late, dude. I thought
for sure you'd chicken out...

12
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,828
...after that pounding
I gave you last time.

13
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,170
How about you put your money
where your mouth s?

14
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,071
My money is everywhere, bitch.

15
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,237
- How about 10,000?
- Carson, what are you doing?

16
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,313
I'm just gonna show Shane...

17
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,044
...why he should stick to hustling
flat-feet at Blue Bay Country Club.

18
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,847
Where are you now? Par four?

19
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,685
You're gonna race, aren't you?

20
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,486
He's gonna race.

21
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,062
- I'm gonna win.
- This is like Divorce Court.

22
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,893
Only hotter.
What's it gonna be then, eh?

23
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,366
- Race to Bird's Point?
- I know you drive...

24
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,597
...like you're blind, but I'm sure
you can see I'm entertaining.

25
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,265
- I have all day to feed you your lunch.
- The number four buoy?

26
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,344
Can I talk to you for a minute?

27
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,271
Sweetie, it'll take 10 minutes...

28
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,248
...and then we'll play
that lawn bowling game you love.

29
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,580
- You guys up for some bocce?
- Yeah!

30
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,588
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,797
It's gonna be over before
the sun hits the first layer of SPF.

32
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,129
- I might sit this one out.
- You're gonna chicken out?

33
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,794
Sit out, not chicken out.

34
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,133
I decided to take on a new skipper.

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,734
- Brandi.
- Yeah!

36
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,281
- You work at the race track?
- I gotta pay for school somehow.

37
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,760
- What kind of shit are you pulling?
- Scared of a girl?

38
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,121
I just don't wanna hear
your excuses later on.

39
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,993
Don't worry about it.

40
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,260
Smoke this fool.

41
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,264
Careful with al that throttle.

42
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,272
Oh, yeah.

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,104
We should agree on a finish line.

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,303
You'll know it's over
when I drop an anchor.

45
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,245
Damn.

46
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:16,598
Shit.

47
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,701
Yeah!

48
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,109
Damn it.

49
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,576
Yeah!

50
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,950
That's what I'm talking about.

51
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,255
How about I buy you a drink?

52
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,061
With all the money you just lost,
how about I buy you one?

53
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,708
Stuben, are we home early?

54
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,714
Stuben. Stuben.

55
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,217
Coming.

56
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,716
- Yes, sir.
- Are we home early?

57
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,394
Few minutes. I noticed there
wasn't much traffic on the causeway.

58
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,756
No, I mean from our trip.

59
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,459
- Should we be back next week?
- Not that I know of. No, sir.

60
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,171
Where does this kid get balls
big enough to do this to my property?

61
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,802
Let me take care of this. Consider
staying in Bal Harbour tonight.

62
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,678
That was a pretty bold turn.

63
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,011
They say fortune favors the bold.

64
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,945
That's what you owe us,
Wheetly, a fortune.

65
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,148
So why are you following me again?

66
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,350
You know her?

67
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,859
- We grew up together.
- Sort of.

68
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,361
Her mother cleaned our house.

69
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,164
That's what's great
about this country, right?

70
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,361
We all end up sharing a beer.

71
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,836
Carson, you don't even know
this girl.

72
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,031
I know how she drives a boat.

73
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,608
Where'd you learn that?

74
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,608
My old man.

75
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,877
- He a captain?
- He was a fisherman.

76
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,381
- He was a lowlife.
- Rach, lighten up.

77
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,480
You know what? Screw you
and this Jerry Springer reject.

78
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,391
Rachel. Rachel.

79
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,857
Shit.

80
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,559
Dude. you got me into this.
Can you help me out?

81
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,063
Fine. But you owe me. Rach.

82
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,980
I want this entire house
arrested for trespassing.

83
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,413
Get off my couch.

84
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,747
They were invited in, sir.

85
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,483
Stuben, how much
do I give the cops every year?

86
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,852
I don't have the exact figure
n front of me, sir...

87
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,224
...but it's large.
- Well, call Captain What's-His-Name.

88
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,524
- Blanchard.
- Tell him it's payback time.

89
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,100
Let's just tow the cars. It's a lot easier
than getting the cops involved.

90
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,931
- Hey, you wanna wait up?
- Hey, Hendricks.

91
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,602
What the hell are you doing
in my home?

92
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,604
Carson invited me.

93
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,845
Stubie.

94
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,723
So your dad was a fisherman.

95
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,728
He was the best.
He had a small boat.

96
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,594
It was in the family for generations.

97
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,132
He loved the water.

98
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,800
So does my father.

99
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:38,768
Boats, race cars and houses.
And not so much a fan of people.

100
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,271
It's because they scuff his floors
and steal his booze.

101
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,311
Must be why he buys so many.

102
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,252
Cars and houses, that is.

103
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,821
- Carson!
- Oh, busted. Big man's here.

104
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,057
Seriously.

105
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,831
Speak of the devil.

106
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,805
What's up, Pops?

107
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,016
If fucking up were a desirable skill,
you would be president right now.

108
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,450
Well, if being an arrogant asshole
was equally valued...

109
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,524
...you'd be my vice.

110
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,352
- This is not your frat house.
- Got the foosball table.

111
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,998
Come on, Carson.
What am I doing wrong here?

112
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,331
I don't know, Ted.

113
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,502
Maybe if Mom was still alive,
she could help.

114
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,978
Is that why you invited
Shane Hendricks?

115
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,671
Just to piss me off?

116
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,113
Just because his dad tried
to screw you out of a lot of money...

117
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,877
...a long time ago...
- Did.

118
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,886
He did screw me out
of a whole lot of money.

119
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,715
Well, it hasn't slowed you down much,
has it?

120
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,727
I'm gonna stay at Bal Harbour tonight.

121
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,025
Poor Dad. Slumming it as usual.

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,226
Hardly. But you will be.

123
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,895
If this place isn't empty and clean
by the time I get back in the morning...

124
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,568
...I will cut you off.

125
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,667
Prom se.

126
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,421
Stop cheating.

127
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,928
Oh, yeah? How do you like that?

128
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,897
- You talk a pretty good game.
- I play a good game.

129
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,101
All right.

130
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,865
Look. et me show you
how it's done, okay?

131
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,237
Now, shoot.

132
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,747
See?

133
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,043
You beat me.

134
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,085
How about a rematch?

135
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,954
I don't wanna embarrass myself
all over again.

136
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,690
Easy there.

137
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:22,303
Why don't you let me win
something for a change?

138
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,737
Like what?

139
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,210
A kissing contest.

140
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,341
Go. Let's go, Blue Bay.

141
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,847
Blue. Go. Let's go, Blue Bay.

142
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,146
It was like everybody could see them,
and no one's paying attention.

143
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,915
I'm telling you, she is such a skank.

144
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,684
- And you're sure he kissed her.
- Positive.

145
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,659
She's finished in Blue Bay.

146
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,194
What are you gonna do about him?

147
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,460
- What do you want?
- To spoil my baby.

148
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,035
Give them to your whore.

149
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,798
What?
Baby, what are you talking about?

150
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,535
Come on, Carson.
I know what you did last night.

151
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,645
- I got drunk.
- Oh, and you just jammed...

152
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,974
...your tongue down
some chick's throat?

153
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,175
Who told you that?

154
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,479
Are you kidding?
I knew every girl there.

155
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,183
- Which one of you said that?
- I did. I saw you.

156
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,689
Are you gonna deny it?

157
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,057
I don't know. I might've kissed her.

158
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,493
I was drunk.

159
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,898
Shit, baby, do you think that meant
anything to me, one stupid kiss?

160
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,733
Do you believe me?

161
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:04,570
Because without your trust,
I'm nothing.

162
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,738
I asked if you believe me.

163
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,678
So are we good?

164
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:17,853
If I find out that you did more than
just kiss her, I'll chop your nuts off.

165
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,548
That's what I love about you.

166
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,219
Excuse me. Sorry.
Mr. Wheetly, the police are here...

167
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,024
...and they need to talk to you.

168
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,224
Let me guess.
about your little boat race?

169
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,562
Can you come with me, please?

170
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,602
Excuse me, ladies.

171
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,711
Officer, let me assure you...

172
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,341
...whatever you heard, I was not racing
my motorboat this weekend.

173
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,044
Carson.

174
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:53,625
Jesus. They got you here too?
What's the charge?

175
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,920
Carson, it's your father.

176
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,356
What about him?

177
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,962
He didn't make it.

178
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,667
It's okay.

179
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,499
We will get through this.

180
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,642
Detective.

181
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,342
Detective Walker.

182
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,426
- You find him?
- He wasn't at home.

183
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,620
Answering machine said
he wouldn't be back till the 25th.

184
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,526
That's next week.

185
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,862
Yeah. I know when it is. Thanks.

186
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,166
Frank, what the hell
is going on here?

187
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,538
This guy must be really important...

188
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,772
...for you to leave your cushy chair
and your view of the heliport.

189
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,678
He's the ninth richest man
in Florida.

190
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,711
Judging by all the pieces
he was blown into...

191
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,048
...I'd say he was five of them.

192
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,683
This is why we don't let him
talk to reporters.

193
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,853
They say that the most dangerous
place in all of Blue Bay...

194
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,623
...s right between Captain Blanchard
and a microphone.

195
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,562
- You got a cigarette?
- No. I quit.

196
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,565
Yeah, me, too. Ten years ago.

197
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,728
But the smell of motor oil...
My dad used to have a shop.

198
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:48,737
- I worked for him in the summers.
- Frank.

199
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,569
Yeah.

200
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,812
How soon can you wrap up?
The press is al over this.

201
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,312
- It depends.
- On what?

202
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,144
On how soon we can figure out
what the hell this thing is.

203
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,515
See, it’s too old to be on a car
that new. And you see that?

204
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,747
That's rust.

205
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:07,688
It's not charring from an explosion.
This is an old part.

206
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,159
Maybe it's part of some
special racing modification.

207
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,731
Hey, you got any idea why a part
that old would be on a car this new?

208
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,029
Not that I know of. But I don't work
on it, so I can't say for sure.

209
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,764
- Who can we ask?
- Chuck Hensler. He's Ted's mechanic.

210
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,568
But he and his family are out
on vacation till the 25th.

211
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,540
- When is that?
- Next week.

212
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,406
Yeah. It's the day after the 24th.

213
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,778
Send it to Forensics, and we'll wait
on this Hensler fellow, okay?

214
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,776
Good deal.

215
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,258
And we pray the loss is balanced
by thanksgiving...

216
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,127
...for the life that was shared with us.
Amen.

217
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,890
Amen.

218
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,593
I'm sorry.

219
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,397
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,656
Let him be alone for a second.
I'll go talk to him.

221
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,065
Everything is gonna be okay,
Carson.

222
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,807
My mom'll kill herself again...

223
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,103
...when she finds out
she has to spend eternity next to him.

224
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,143
Even if it is just his ashes.

225
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,440
Maybe they'll make up in heaven.

226
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,084
Or fight like dogs in hell.

227
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:46,286
Carson, I know
this is an awful time, but...

228
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,360
...there are some things
we need to discuss when you're ready.

229
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,326
You mean the will?

230
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,703
George, can you give me
a few days?

231
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,533
I don't think I can right now.

232
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,540
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
take as long as you need.

233
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,972
Just a few days is all.

234
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:13,210
Yeah. whatever.
Okay. Good. Okay.

235
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,904
Well, what I'm about to say
may seem like a shock...

236
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,842
...but in time, I think
you'll come to see it's a gift.

237
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,179
Not gonna tell me
he left everything...

238
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,251
...to a quarter horse
named Pole Dancer.

239
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,912
Knowing your father, it would have
been a dolphin named Flipper.

240
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:56,185
Your father put all the money in a trust
for you and named me the executor.

241
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,193
And, as per the trust rules...

242
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,824
...I can take a limited amount out
for living expenses...

243
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,937
...but you won't receive
the balance until you're 30.

244
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,664
How's that possible?

245
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:12,076
I saw the will when my mother died.
It didn't have any of this.

246
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,270
No, it didn't. But he revised it.

247
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,779
You're joking, right?

248
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,943
I'm afraid not.

249
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:22,019
Are you kidding me?
Minimal expenses?

250
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,079
So what does that mean?

251
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,884
We'll run the house
and pay for your car insurance.

252
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,894
Anything else,
you'll have to earn yourself.

253
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,588
This has got to be
a fucking joke now.

254
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,601
Baby, listen, it's okay.
We'll make do.

255
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,930
What about food or anything else?

256
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,471
There's no way
to get any more money.

257
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,473
Sure. There's some exceptions.

258
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,406
In case of a medical emergency...

259
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,605
...if you wanna go back to school
or if you wanna get married...

260
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,444
...or if you...
- Married?

261
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,882
Yeah, yeah.
There is a provision in the trust...

262
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:58,421
...that does give me a little leeway
on distributing the funds.

263
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,923
I can do as I see ft
to promote the marriage.

264
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,993
Well, I'm not getting married.

265
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,761
Rachel. Rach.

266
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,005
It's not that I don't love you.

267
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,166
- It's just that I feel like...
- But what, Carson? You're a jerk.

268
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:21,177
You know what?
I didn't wanna marry you either.

269
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,441
But I just wish you didn't say no
so quickly.

270
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,279
It's like I'm some sort
of disgusting person or something.

271
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,148
- It's not that.
- Don't touch me.

272
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,949
You don't deserve me.

273
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,696
Would you put anything like this
in Ted's car?

274
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,598
We didn't use nothing old
in that car.

275
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,865
Shit, Ted didn't even use
the same steering wheel twice.

276
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,368
You have a lot of girls
working the pit crews?

277
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,445
More and more. Shane Hendricks'
got a girl working for him.

278
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,807
And a sexy one, too.

279
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,473
You have no idea how this wound up
underneath Ted Wheetly's hood?

280
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,643
- I might.
- You might.

281
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,279
Well, see, since I knew you was
coming, I pulled some records.

282
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,358
The night before the crash,
Ted Wheetly's car ended up...

283
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,892
...n Shane Hendricks' garage.

284
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,530
- And that's unusual, why?
- It never happens.

285
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,563
- Never happens?
- Never.

286
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,497
Especially since Ted hated
Shane and his father.

287
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,162
- We weren't allowed to say their name.
- Hang on. They hated each other.

288
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,534
- Why?
- I don't know.

289
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,575
- You don't know.
- Look, man, I just fix the cars, okay?

290
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,371
They don't tell me the secrets.

291
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,537
How did the car wind up
n Shane's garage?

292
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,841
Beats me. It just did.

293
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,081
- Can I go in there?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,585
Got any lights in this place?

295
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,268
- Quaint little garage.
- The best that money can buy.

296
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,030
- Everything in here is.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

297
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,900
Come on, you're a smart guy.
Te me.

298
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:59,238
Who could arrange for Wheetly's car
to spend the night in a place like this?

299
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,180
- Fuck.
- Afraid you're gonna lose your job?

300
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:06,011
I'll take you to jai.
Who can arrange it?

301
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,116
Shane's the only one who can do it.

302
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,522
This is his space.

303
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,625
How can I see what that thing sees?

304
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,577
This is where we keep
all the surveillance tapes.

305
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,147
I wanna see the night before
Wheetly's car blew.

306
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,284
Yes, sir.

307
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,485
All right. Here we go.

308
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:05,175
- What was that? Did you see that?
- Yeah, let me back it up.

309
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,667
Right there.

310
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,075
The time code just jumped
two hours.

311
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,741
When you say the time code
jumped two hours...

312
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,612
...you mean it erased two hours?

313
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,916
Possibly. This system
does randomly erase materials...

314
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,423
Hang on. Hang on a second.
You're telling me...

315
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,857
...that on this once-in-a-m lion
night...

316
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,020
...that I wanna see,
two hours of footage...

317
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,133
...this system randomly erased?
- It was possible.

318
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,700
But not likely.

319
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,804
Tell me something. Who other
than the guards has access...

320
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,500
...to this particular system?
- Just Shane Hendricks.

321
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,873
Just Shane Hendricks.

322
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,478
Yeah.

323
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,147
Looks like you
are not going to jail, my friend.

324
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,893
What?

325
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,562
Rach, please, come out here
and talk to me.

326
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,574
Okay. What?

327
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,911
You lock yourself
in the bedroom for six hours.

328
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,744
I know. I'm sorry.
I was furious at you.

329
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,414
It's not that I don't wanna marry you.

330
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,259
It's just that we're so young.

331
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,055
We have plenty of time.

332
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,756
I know. I'm sorry.

333
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,595
I'm sorry I was acting crazy.

334
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,567
I just can't help it sometimes.

335
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,399
Don't do that again.

336
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,735
I won't.

337
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,959
Close your eyes.

338
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:12,067
And think about what I'm gonna
do to you when I get back.

339
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,079
- Carson Wheetly, you're under arrest.
- For what?

340
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,484
For the rape of Brand Cox.
Come on, let's go.

341
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,642
- Rape?
- She's a liar.

342
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,618
Yeah. Gotta take him in. Let's go.

343
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,780
Let's go. Come on.

344
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,118
Call George.

345
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,659
- Keep moving.
- Call George.

346
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,319
This way.

347
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,309
Coming forward was the hardest
decision a girl like me could make.

348
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,813
But I've a ways been a fighter...

349
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,918
...and this is the most important
fight of my life.

350
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,916
Carson Wheetly raped me.

351
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,519
And just because he's rich...

352
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,685
...does not mean
he can get away with it.

353
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:13,855
And I'd also like to thank
Linda Dobson...

354
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:18,435
...who saw it a happen
and had the courage to speak out.

355
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,016
George, where have you been?

356
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,620
I got here as soon as I could.

357
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,050
I made a few phone calls.

358
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,487
They can release you
on bail tomorrow morning.

359
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,718
George, I'm innocent.
I swear to God.

360
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:45,056
We got drunk and kissed,
but that's it.

361
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,063
Girl would say anything
to get her claws on Carson's money.

362
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,669
I just wish we could pay her off.
I mean, this thing could go on forever.

363
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,967
- Who knows how a jury will respond?
- Can't we use some of the money?

364
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,668
George, I'm fighting for my life here.
My dad would've understood.

365
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,076
Of course,
but my hands are still tied.

366
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:07,582
The terms are clear. They don't leave
a lot of room for improvisation.

367
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:10,881
Marriage, medical emergency,
schooling.

368
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,254
Well...

369
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,594
I guess we have to get married.
That's what you're saying.

370
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:23,030
I wasn't, no. I mean, suppose it would
make an easier case for the payout...

371
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,195
...hard to have much of a marriage
with Carson in jai, but there's no...

372
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,715
Baby, I don't want you to do
anything you don't wanna do.

373
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,277
I want to.

374
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,618
You're my everything.

375
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,257
And you're my everything, baby.

376
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,225
You two deserve
some happiness, a one.

377
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,938
I'll make the arrangements.

378
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,777
Brandi, what would you say
to a settlement offer?

379
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,124
A part of me would say,
"Go fuck yourself, asshole."

380
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,420
You don't know
what I've been through.

381
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,962
- And the other part?
- The other part would say $25 million.

382
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,123
You gold-digging bitch.

383
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,666
Thirty? Thirty-five?

384
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,498
What number would hurt you
as much as you hurt me, Carson?

385
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:35,299
- Choke on it.
- Enough.

386
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:39,274
Okay, enough. Enough.
We're offering 2 million.

387
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,179
That's an insult. I talked to the DA.

388
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,339
He is chomping
at the bit to prosecute.

389
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,348
With what? A "he said, she said?"

390
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,077
"He said, she said?"

391
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,690
Linda Dobson swears she saw
your guy getting rough with Brandi.

392
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,418
P ease, I got six guys
who'll swear she was so drunk...

393
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:57,459
...she tried to make
out with a beer keg.

394
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,689
You've got a 50 percent chance.
I'm offering you a sure thing.

395
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,198
Even if she settles,
the DA can still prosecute.

396
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,303
It's in your best interest
to make sure that doesn't happen.

397
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,475
Once the charges are dropped,
we'll offer...

398
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,307
- We'll make it 3 million.
- I want 10.

399
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,215
- In your dreams.
- Careful, Carson.

400
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,154
A nice butt like that, you're gonna be
very popular with the boys in the yard.

401
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:31,319
You've already committed perjury.
Let's stay away from extortion.

402
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,691
How about 5?

403
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,865
That's $100,000. I won't even
hold it against the 5 million.

404
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,601
- Checking in, ma'am?
- Bet your ass I am.

405
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,605
- Do you have any bags?
- Just this.

406
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,765
Jesus Christ,
you could've killed me.

407
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,133
Innocent until proven guilty.

408
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,303
You are guilty. Guilty as hell.

409
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,237
Just as much as you are.

410
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,107
How'd you get in here?

411
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,081
It's my father's hotel.

412
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,448
I've got the keys to the kingdom,
thanks to you.

413
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,485
I could definitely get used to this.

414
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,826
You better.

415
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,428
When does the money
get transferred?

416
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,591
A month.

417
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,332
Paperwork and shit.

418
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,143
I still can't believe the bastard
changed his will.

419
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,845
Enough bus ness.

420
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,142
Let's focus on pleasure.

421
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,287
I wish we could have gotten more.

422
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:51,027
That little bitch, I just wanted
to smack that smile off his face.

423
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,865
He's not a bad guy.

424
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,441
He just got this crazy
sense of loyalty to my old man.

425
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,544
And me too, I guess.

426
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,010
What are you complaining about?

427
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,379
You've got a beautiful fiancée.

428
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,850
A smoking-hot girlfriend.

429
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,888
And a bunch of running-around
money. That's evil shit.

430
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,026
Criminal.

431
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,185
Almost as bad as setting
someone up for rape.

432
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,783
Man, oh, man.

433
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:07,395
Shane Hendricks?
I'm Detective Frank Walker.

434
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,726
I'm investigating
the death of Ted Wheetly.

435
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,232
I thought it was an accident.

436
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:15,897
Yeah, I thought it was too, but a lot
of strange shit going on. Funny things.

437
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,242
Why I et the man I hate
store his car in my garage.

438
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,403
- Yeah, that's one of them.
- Because Brandi Cox asked me to.

439
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,640
- You know Brand Cox?
- Sure.

440
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,409
She worked my crew
for six months.

441
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,713
Girl could strip an engine
in five minutes.

442
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,720
Plus she looked good covered in oil.

443
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,086
What about Linda Dobson?
Do you know her too?

444
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,091
- From around, sure.
- You've seen her lately?

445
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,686
Nope.

446
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,891
Tel me something, Shane.

447
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:46,231
Why in the world would Brandi Cox
want Ted Wheetly's car...

448
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,497
...stored in your fancy garage?

449
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,698
She didn't say and I didn't care.

450
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,902
Don't say no to a hot piece of ass
like that. That illegal, detective?

451
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:56,903
Maybe.

452
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:59,243
I got into a lot of trouble
when I was a kid.

453
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,614
Stupid things. Boosting cars,
some pot, nothing big.

454
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,621
- But I did learn one thing.
- Really? What's that?

455
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,624
Cops are a bunch of assholes.

456
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,121
You can call my attorney
if you wanna talk again.

457
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,261
"Cops are a bunch of assholes."

458
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,801
Stupid fucking hat.

459
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:47,058
- You're not the pizza guy.
- No, I'm Detective Frank Walker.

460
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,325
I'd like to ask you
a few questions if I might.

461
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,833
Sure. Want a drink?

462
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,138
Thanks. It's hot out here.

463
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,672
- That's very interesting iced tea.
- My mom's recipe.

464
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,009
Only thing she ever gave me.

465
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,153
Anyways, detective.
what can I do for you?

466
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,846
I wanted to ask you about your
relationship with Shane Hendricks.

467
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,983
- He was my boss.
- That's it?

468
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,788
- Yes.
- But he wanted more?

469
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,791
I suppose.

470
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,833
And you used that to get favors.

471
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,336
No. Never asked him for anything.

472
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,839
He told me that you asked him
to keep Ted's car in his garage.

473
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,473
He told me the only reason
he agreed...

474
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,637
...was because
you were such a pretty girl.

475
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,141
I doubt he used the words
"pretty girl."

476
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,719
Actually, I'd put money
on "hot piece of ass."

477
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,957
And be that the case, detective,
and...

478
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,185
...I used to think this was the hottest
piece of ass in Glade City.

479
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,228
But even if I did ask him,
there's no way Shane Hendricks...

480
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,229
...would ever do anything
for Wheetly.

481
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,231
Why is that?

482
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,567
Because Ted hated Shane's pops.

483
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,503
I hear he wanted to kill him
over some bad deal in the Keys.

484
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,243
Well, I'll have to look into that.

485
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,572
Thank you.

486
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:19,319
Hey, one more thing.

487
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,226
Do you ever talk
to Linda Dobson at all?

488
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,520
No, I haven't.
I don't really know her.

489
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,255
Right.

490
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,231
Yeah.

491
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,496
Well, thanks for your time.

492
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,417
We need to talk.

493
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,931
This better be important enough
to ruin my updo.

494
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,433
I got a little spooked, okay?

495
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,303
A detective came to my house,
I started thinking I could go to jail.

496
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,200
We're in this together.
We could all go.

497
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:15,574
That's bull shit. Okay, you have
a house and a brand-new Mercedes.

498
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,807
I'm stuck living in a shack
with leaky pipes and water stains.

499
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:24,148
You are set for life. If he dies,
you inherit everything.

500
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:27,553
You're screwing me. can fee it.

501
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,590
No, Brandi.

502
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,161
That's so not true.

503
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,464
I haven't seen you in days.

504
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,491
Brandi, you knew
it was gonna be like this.

505
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,297
Yeah, but I didn't think
it was gonna be this hard.

506
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,565
I'm all alone, okay?
You're out getting married.

507
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,335
Okay. This is the only way...

508
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:48,604
...that we could get you
some money right now.

509
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,342
And then, when Carson turns 30,
we hit the jackpot.

510
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,342
Come here.

511
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,353
You believe me, don't you?

512
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,977
I'd like to introduce to you all...

513
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,981
...Mr. and Mrs. Carson Wheetly.

514
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,028
Who needs a drink?

515
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,034
Happy, healthy...

516
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,838
Wealthy and wise.

517
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,913
Mrs. Wheetly.

518
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:06,085
I just wanted to say that even though
we did this for practical reasons...

519
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,560
...I’m really glad.

520
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,592
I love you.

521
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,829
Baby, I love you too.

522
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:23,005
We're gonna be so happy.

523
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,942
What do you think we should do,
now that we're marred?

524
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,368
I don't know.

525
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:34,780
Should we open our gifts and see
how many blenders we got?

526
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,613
I was thinking of something
a little more fun.

527
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,215
Like wine glasses.

528
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,619
A margarita set?

529
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:58,968
What asshole
do you think forgot his keys?

530
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:03,737
Call the valet, dickhead.

531
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,473
Is this a bad time?

532
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,142
Are you here to arrest me again?

533
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,810
It's hotter than hell out here.

534
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,218
Do you mind if I come in
and talk for a while?

535
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,462
What can I help you with, detective?

536
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,589
There's been some developments
in your father's case.

537
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,565
When's the last time
you saw Shane Hendricks?

538
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,132
The day before my father died.

539
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,833
We raced boats right outside.

540
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,905
Does he have
something to do with this?

541
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,675
- I don't know, maybe.
- Did you talk to him?

542
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:43,582
Yeah, he wasn't very cooperative.

543
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:45,845
He hates cops.

544
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,786
You know I kind of got that.

545
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,358
You and he are friends, huh?

546
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,853
He liked to come around
and piss off my dad.

547
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,797
And yet, you chose to hang out
with him anyway, right?

548
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:01,501
We were friends since we were kids.
We know the same people.

549
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:06,007
Look, maybe I wanted
to piss off my dad too.

550
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,372
Was Shane sleeping
with Brandi Cox?

551
00:44:10,448 --> 00:44:14,316
How should I know?
I never met her before the other day.

552
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,386
Oh, right. Right.

553
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,820
She involved with this too?

554
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,192
Damned if I know. Too early to tell.

555
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:25,829
I wouldn't rule her out though.

556
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:30,058
In fact, I wouldn't rule anyone out.

557
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:34,668
You're probably anxious to get back
with your wife. Thanks for your time.

558
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,809
Oh, and you rest assured,
young man...

559
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,706
...I will find your father's killer.

560
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,152
He knows.

561
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,015
He doesn't know anything.

562
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,588
Did you tell him what we said?

563
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,748
Yeah, that Shane hated my dad,
I told him.

564
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:57,326
Then he asked about Brandi,
said she was a suspect.

565
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,587
A suspect?

566
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,027
- Yeah, might be a suspect.
- "Was" or "might be?"

567
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,394
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

568
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,592
He's on to her.

569
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:08,227
Carson, we knew
he was gonna suspect Brandi.

570
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,173
I'm pretty sure
that Brandi won't talk.

571
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,277
Pretty sure? Jesus, Rach.
You said she was 100 percent.

572
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,778
I know, I thought so.
But now I don't know.

573
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,747
I didn't wanna tell you, before
the wedding she came to me...

574
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,785
...and she just started talking
a I this crazy stuff...

575
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:26,287
...about how she wasn't happy
with our arrangement.

576
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,128
- She threaten you?
- This is why I didn't wanna tell you.

577
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,735
I knew you'd get al worked up.

578
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,737
- Rach, did she threaten you?
- Sort of.

579
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,311
We gotta take care of her
before Walker to gets her.

580
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,813
I'll set it up.

581
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,907
Where?

582
00:45:57,288 --> 00:46:00,655
Tonight at the hotel
by the Glades.

583
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:08,295
It's okay, we can do this.

584
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,004
I'm worried about Walker.

585
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,311
Hey, cap, you got a minute?

586
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:28,581
Yeah. Larry, Larry, you know I can't
comment on an ongoing investigation.

587
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,513
All right, yup, always a pleasure.

588
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,155
Why the hell isn't that Ted Wheetly
case closed?

589
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,956
Well, I was waiting for Forensics
to give me a report...

590
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,190
...on that piece I found at the scene.

591
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,964
- And?
- It's an intake manifold valve...

592
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,832
...from a 1998 V10.
- So?

593
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,701
So Ted would never let anything
in his car that wasn't new.

594
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,003
This part in particular was recalled.
When the car hit 5000 rpm...

595
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:57,045
...there was a good chance
that it would spark up and explode.

596
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,682
Maybe we should all
get out of Dodge, you know?

597
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,148
Wait for the money to land.
Let things cool down.

598
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,221
I don't think Carson wants you
to get a penny of his money.

599
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,880
- The check's being sent to me.
- I think he's scheming.

600
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,723
It's his birthright. He doesn't
want a couple of silly swamp girls...

601
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,557
...to get their hands on it.

602
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,665
Okay, any suspects?

603
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,895
- Shane Hendricks.
- You're not serious.

604
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,470
- I am serious.
- Do you know who his father is?

605
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,005
Yes, the new ninth richest man
in Miami.

606
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:27,076
When the money drops,
you and me will bolt town.

607
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,235
We' cut our losses.
It's still $5 million.

608
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,849
- It's plenty to get by on.
- I don't wanna just get by.

609
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:35,743
We did this so we wouldn't have to.

610
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,080
So what are you thinking?

611
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,752
It's like you said.

612
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:46,095
With Carson out of the way...
I mean, I'm the sole heir to his trust.

613
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,597
I don't know about this, Rachel.

614
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,860
Brandi, it's a little ate now
to be getting cold feet.

615
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,027
Don't you think?

616
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,868
- And you want me to bring him n?
- No, I didn't say that.

617
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,409
I said he was a suspect. And no,
I do not want to bring him in yet.

618
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,548
Not until I find out what's really
going on with Brandi Cox.

619
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,115
The girl who got raped?
How is she involved?

620
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,617
Something about her working for
Shane does not sit right with me.

621
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:12,889
I need your help.

622
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,459
Without it, we get nothing.

623
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,885
When?

624
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:24,932
We're meeting later tonight
at the hotel by the Glades.

625
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,775
It's okay. We can do this.

626
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,804
This is Blue Bay, not Miami. No se
complaints and the occasional drunk...

627
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,247
...that's about all the excitement
we can handle.

628
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,649
I won't have a homicide
cluttering up my backyard.

629
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:46,813
- Now close it quick.
- I'm trying to do that, captain.

630
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:51,792
Which is why I thought maybe I'd go
down to the Keys, poke around a bit.

631
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,987
If you pay for my gas?

632
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:12,839
Here, why don't you let me
help you with that?

633
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,783
That's sweet. Hey, aren't you
Adam Klotsen's cousin?

634
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,355
- I think I've seen you before.
- No. No. I'm...

635
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,458
I'm looking for Darlene Cox.

636
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,527
- You a cop?
- Yeah. Up at Blue Bay.

637
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,859
- What do you want with Darlene?
- It's about her daughter Brand.

638
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:31,967
I'm Darlene. What did she do?

639
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,026
Nothing.

640
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,803
I'm part of the rape investigation.

641
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,366
She'd been raped?

642
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,535
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

643
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,171
Not since she and Rachel
left for school.

644
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,715
I just knew something bad
would happen.

645
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,012
No, no, she's...

646
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,551
She's gonna be fine. Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

647
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:58,657
- If you think it'll help.
- I think it will. You just said that...

648
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,490
...she and Rachel
went to school together?

649
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,032
Of course they did.
They was always together.

650
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:09,229
It was like the two of them grew
from the same branch or something.

651
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:13,308
I'm a little confused.
Well, I thought that you...

652
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,741
I thought you used to clean
Rachel's estate.

653
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,379
Estate? You mean
that old trailer up on bricks?

654
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,817
Hell. the only thing that would
clean that is a great big hurricane...

655
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,684
...f you know what I mean.

656
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,052
Yeah. know what you...
So you're telling me...

657
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,251
...that Rachel and Brandi
were best friends.

658
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:33,495
Ever since they were girls.

659
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,928
They'd go up in that cabin
all day in the woods.

660
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,059
- Doing what?
- Just being kids, I guess.

661
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,104
Brandi had a couple of old junkers
she was working on up there.

662
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:47,771
Thing is, Rachel filled that girl's head
with all sorts of things.

663
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:50,038
- What kind of things?
- Like the two of them...

664
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,944
...they was gonna go find themselves
some rich husbands.

665
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,617
I don't know where
they came up with that idea.

666
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,220
And now look what happened.

667
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,416
Yeah. One more question.

668
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:05,118
Where's this old cabin
in the woods?

669
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:24,561
Anderson. Frank Walker. I need you
to run a part number for me, all right?

670
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,700
Yeah.

671
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,273
I got a feeling it's gonna come up
as a '98 V10.

672
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,620
Stick to the plan, you' I be fine.

673
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,208
Damn.

674
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:18,314
I ain't seen you in a while.

675
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,494
Squeeze it.

676
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,702
Do it!

677
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,543
Rach, now!

678
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,145
Do it!

679
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,982
Do you think she's gonna kill me?

680
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,356
Rach, now.

681
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,049
You backstabbing bitch!

682
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,278
I am glad did it.

683
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,914
You have blood all over your shirt.

684
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,384
Here. take it off. I'll burn it.

685
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:35,550
- Did you bring Carson's laptop?
- Yeah. It's in the duffle bag.

686
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,459
Okay. How does this sound?

687
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:51,599
"I, Carson Wheetly, admit
to killing my father, Ted Wheetly."

688
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,299
Go on.

689
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:57,072
"He killed my mother.
He was a womanizer...

690
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,444
...a drunk, and a violent man."

691
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:06,647
"He got what he deserved, just like
this bullet will deliver what I deserve."

692
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:11,222
No sign of a struggle.
No other prints.

693
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:14,159
A note. Hell, my 2-year-o d
could've closed this one.

694
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,628
So that's it?

695
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,563
Crazy rich kid kills his father...

696
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,795
...can't stand himself, so he comes
down here and shoots himself?

697
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,166
- That's it?
- Open and shut.

698
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:29,141
Yeah. Well, why did he drive
all the way down to the swamp?

699
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,009
Why didn't he just
shoot himself at home?

700
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,481
Detective, I invited you down here
as a courtesy...

701
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:38,746
...because, well, this is your boy.

702
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,857
But as far as the Everglades City P.D.
is concerned...

703
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,858
...it’s stone crab time.

704
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:48,327
- Did you notify the next of kin?
- She identified the body this morning.

705
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:18,956
There you are, sir.

706
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:20,562
Can I help you, detective?

707
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,824
I'm sorry for your loss.

708
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:26,666
I didn't know condolence calls
were part of the job.

709
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,401
Must be one of the benefits
of being the ninth richest person...

710
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:33,668
...n the State of Florida.

711
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:43,316
This whole thing worked out
kind of nice for you.

712
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:46,418
How all this worked out. isn't it?

713
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:54,257
By nice you mean
losing my husband?

714
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:55,420
No, no, no.

715
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,057
By nice I mean by you finally
nabbing yourself a rich boy...

716
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:00,760
...and all of his riches.

717
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,763
So where'd you get that?

718
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,534
The old cabin by your house.

719
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,271
The cabin where you and Brandi Cox
plotted to find you a husband.

720
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:13,280
- So what?
- Motive.

721
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:17,382
That doesn't prove anything,
detective. Except that I'm poor...

722
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,547
...and that I pretended not to be
because I was embarrassed by it.

723
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,694
I just wanted to find myself
a good guy.

724
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:27,255
That a crime?

725
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:29,695
No, it's not a crime.

726
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:34,735
And actually, coming from anyone
but you, it might be touching.

727
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:41,275
You enjoy your trip
down memory lane.

728
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,072
I'll see myself out.

729
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,848
- Hello?
- Walker came by to visit.

730
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:21,779
He had the file on Cason.

731
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,010
How?

732
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,017
- He was in the cabin.
- What?

733
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,849
You left that there? Are you crazy?

734
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:30,515
- We're gonna get caught.
- It's just a file. Doesn't prove anything.

735
01:00:30,694 --> 01:00:32,355
We have to stick to the plan.

736
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:35,362
I don't like this, Rach. I'm scared.

737
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,659
I told you about Walker
so you'd be prepared...

738
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,860
...n case he came by to see you.
- I'm not sure I can do this.

739
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,097
- I wanna meet, okay? I need to.
- We can't. It's too risky.

740
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:46,367
I need to see you.
I'm not fucking around.

741
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:47,874
Okay, okay.

742
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,376
- Calm down. Where?
- The cabin.

743
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,175
Are you crazy? He's been there.

744
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,376
I know. We can make sure there's
nothing we need to get rid of.

745
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:02,324
- All right.
- One hour.

746
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,587
Hey.

747
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,189
I can't believe
we used to hang out here.

748
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,095
Remember what else
we used to do?

749
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,534
Brandi, this isn't funny.

750
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,229
Listen, if we keep up this shit
we're gonna get caught.

751
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,102
Sit down.

752
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,499
Sit down.

753
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,945
How long since
we've been here together?

754
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,213
I don't know. A couple of years.
Look, I need to know that you're...

755
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,916
You taught me
so many things, remember?

756
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:15,455
I do. Listen, I need to know
you're not gonna crack.

757
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:19,963
I'm okay, now that I see you.

758
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,772
Can't I move into your house?

759
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:31,306
How do we explain that?

760
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,982
We'll figure it out.

761
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:42,417
You're not gonna let up
until I give in, are you?

762
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,793
You need to relax.

763
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,670
Nice try.

764
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:06,505
Brandi, what are you doing?

765
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,948
The same thing you were gonna
do to me. You think I'm stupid.

766
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,850
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just put the gun down.

767
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,857
Problem is, I don't trust you.

768
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,154
You always were
such a se fish bitch.

769
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,297
No loyalty.

770
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:26,332
I've been thinking
and that $5 million is plenty for me.

771
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:27,697
Call me simple.

772
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,361
I'm gonna get all the money.

773
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,975
So I'll give you everything,
whatever you want.

774
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,371
I want you dead.

775
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,035
I can't have you blabbing
your mouth to everyone.

776
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:39,375
It's too bad.

777
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,380
You really are a hot piece of ass.

778
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,138
Rachel.

779
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,069
Come on out, baby.

780
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,991
Rachel.

781
01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:37,401
I don't even care about the money.
I just wanna see your pretty little face.

782
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:41,493
No.

783
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,996
No!

784
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:08,862
Detective, a girl walked in,
says she needs to talk to you.

785
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:10,863
- Said it's urgent.
- She give you a name?

786
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:12,467
Rachel Thomas.

787
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,669
Really?

788
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:25,041
I didn't think getting you in here
would be quite this easy.

789
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,376
Brandi Cox tried to kill me.

790
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:30,047
Detective.

791
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:39,486
Would you excuse me for a minute?

792
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,674
Hello, Brandi.

793
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,172
Have I got a story for you, detective.

794
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,644
When we were 16...

795
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:02,251
...one of Ted Wheetly's companies
came to Glade City...

796
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,387
...bought up all the commercial
fishing rights.

797
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,353
Put Brand's father out of bus ness.

798
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,423
He killed himself.

799
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,258
Brandi wanted revenge.

800
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:17,024
My father had nothing to do with this.
I mean, yeah, he killed himself...

801
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,259
...but it wasn't just because
of Ted Wheetly.

802
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,598
Even if I did blame Wheetly,
what was I gonna do about it?

803
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,899
She thought she looked
too trailer-trash...

804
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:29,943
...to nab any rich white guy
or any of his friends.

805
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,907
So she wanted me to do it for her.

806
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:36,279
I told her straight up
I wasn't gonna help her.

807
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:41,051
But I started reading
all this stuff about Carson...

808
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:45,091
...and I guess you could say
I fell for him.

809
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,286
So I came to Blue Bay to find him.

810
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:50,523
I came to Blue Bay because I knew
I had to get out of the Glades.

811
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,691
I had a friend here.

812
01:07:53,303 --> 01:07:55,237
Well, I thought I had a friend here.

813
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,863
Brandi was always jealous
of my relationship with Carson.

814
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,977
From the beginning,
she wanted to kill his father.

815
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,908
But then...

816
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:08,984
...after she found out
that Carson and me were in love...

817
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:12,220
...she wanted to kill him, too.

818
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,913
I thought the whole thing was funny.

819
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,393
I mean. here's Rachel,
this girl from the trailer park...

820
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,291
...convincing all these rich kids
that she was one of them.

821
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,160
I was proud of her
until I realized her plan...

822
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,393
...to kill Ted Wheetly
and take his money.

823
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:29,663
She convinced Carson
to kill his father.

824
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:34,001
But it was easy
because Carson hated his dad.

825
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,941
Carson and Rachel
came to me first.

826
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,343
He blamed his dad
for king his mom.

827
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,245
- And Carson wanted him dead.
- Not at first.

828
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:46,616
But Rachel worked on him.
And in the end he did.

829
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,121
And when I said no,
I wouldn't do it...

830
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,261
...that's when they hooked up
with Shane Hendricks to help them.

831
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:57,422
I said no, but it didn't matter.

832
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,693
Rachel got Shane Hendricks
to do it.

833
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,633
Why, at any time,
didn't you go to the police?

834
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,172
Detective, I'm just
a poor girl from the swamp.

835
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:09,709
I grew up thinking that a I cops
wanted to do was just throw you in jail.

836
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:14,714
What the hell is going on?

837
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,375
I need a bulldozer
to get through a this horseshit.

838
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:20,021
- Neither of them is telling the truth.
- They both are.

839
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:24,216
- And they're both lying their asses off.
- What do you think happened?

840
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,828
I think that they preyed
on this innocent kid Carson.

841
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,863
Now he's out of the way,
they're trying to screw each other...

842
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,228
...out of the money.
That's what I think.

843
01:09:32,402 --> 01:09:35,064
What about the other kid,
Shane Hendricks?

844
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,796
No, he's a dupe.

845
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:40,033
These girls are much too smart
to clue in a joker like that.

846
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:42,871
What can you prove?

847
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,848
Nothing. Absolutely nothing,
not yet.

848
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:52,754
I have to cut them loose.
We can't hold them without charges.

849
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,722
- I got confessions.
- Accusations, unsubstantiated ones.

850
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,862
- One of those girls...
- The ninth richest girl in Florida.

851
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,726
Yeah, I know. I know, and
she's getting away with murder.

852
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,893
All right. Anybody know we got the
ninth richest girl in Miami in custody?

853
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,103
- A right, Brandi.
- I have proof.

854
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:16,040
All this happened so fast
that Rachel didn't get a chance...

855
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,043
...to feed the evidence to the gators.

856
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,947
And you know where it is.

857
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,784
She made me promise not to tell,
but I have to do the right thing.

858
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,286
You really expect me
to believe that?

859
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,789
I'm telling you the evidence is there.

860
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:34,459
Everything you need to close
the case and be the hero.

861
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:37,254
Where?

862
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,125
The cabin.

863
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:11,328
In that cabinet Is a blue gym bag.

864
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:16,999
Inside Is a hard drive with the security
disks from Shane's garage...

865
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:18,834
...the night of Ted's murder.

866
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,669
They show Carson and Rachel...

867
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,004
...breaking in and rigging the car...

868
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:27,479
...installing a jacked-up
part from some V10 engine.

869
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,354
Rachel's shirt is In the bag, too.

870
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:38,187
And you know what?

871
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:41,023
It's covered in Carson's blood.

872
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:43,665
You can find her wearing it
in pictures at the house.

873
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,531
You better have ironclad proof
or I' I sue this whole city.

874
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:50,137
Brandi told us all
about the blue gym bag.

875
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,501
- What blue gym bag?
- The one down at the cabin.

876
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,973
The one that has
all the security tapes...

877
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,136
...and all the bloody clothes in it.
That gym bag.

878
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,043
I don't know
what you're talking about.

879
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:03,379
It really doesn't matter, because
your face is all over the tapes...

880
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:05,680
...and Carson's blood
s all over your shirt.

881
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,550
That bitch set me up.

882
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,210
All right, listen up.
As some of you might...

883
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:39,912
...already know. today is Frank's
last day on the force.

884
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,387
- A right, great.
- A right.

885
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,423
Retire while you are
relatively young.

886
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:48,086
That is the only advice my old man
gave me that I ever decided to take.

887
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:50,528
We, we're all
real proud of you, Frank.

888
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,430
You persisted when most of us
would have stopped.

889
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:56,265
You solved the biggest homicide
in Blue Bay's history.

890
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:59,067
There's no better way to go out
than when you're on top.

891
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,607
Thank you, Captain.

892
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,607
Frank, turn that up a minute,
will you?

893
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,770
Now, as per the trust...

894
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,280
- Sure thing.
...money's passed to Wheetly blood.

895
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:11,943
We'll establish the Wheetly Business
School at Blue Bay University.

896
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:15,716
...and the Ted Wheetly
Memorial Speedway.

897
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,453
We will also be making a sizeable
donation to the Cayman Reef Fund.

898
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:21,961
Millions of dollars to a bunch of fish.

899
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:26,124
- The whole world's gone crazy.
- Too crazy for me.

900
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:30,261
So tell me, Frank, what the hell
are you gonna do now anyway?

901
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,465
Yup.

902
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,395
Bingo.

903
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:06,969
Do you even know
how to drive this thing?

904
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,268
How hard could it be?

905
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,244
I have a couple of manuals
in my duffel.

906
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,280
The way I figure it,
we just point this baby southeast...

907
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,016
...give her a little gas,
eventually we run into an island.

908
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,660
What do you say
we get the hell out of this town?

909
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,159
Aye, aye, Captain.

910
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,534
What are you doing back there?

911
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,700
Re ax, Frank.

912
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:18,540
Just wanted to give you a massage.

913
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:23,250
Look, I think we need to get something
straight right now, okay?

914
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:26,877
I don't trust you, and you sure as hell
shouldn't trust me.

915
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:30,548
We're not partners,
we're not even really friends, and...

916
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,253
...as intriguing as the whole not on is,
I don't think we should have sex.

917
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:37,160
What I think we should do
is get our asses to the is and...

918
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,767
...split the money
and then become nothing...

919
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:43,098
...but distant memories to one another.
You're good with that?

920
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:47,602
- Okay.
- Good. Now, turn around.

921
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:51,008
- What for?
- Call it morbid curiosity.

922
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:54,373
All the way.

923
01:15:58,454 --> 01:15:59,853
Not armed.

924
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:03,287
No, but that does not necessarily
mean that you are not dangerous.

925
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:06,254
We both know that.

926
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:12,425
Okay, no massage,
no making out, no sex.

927
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:15,468
What about beer?
Or are you some sort of puritan?

928
01:16:15,638 --> 01:16:16,730
No, beer is good.

929
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,470
You know what I can't he p
thinking?

930
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:26,581
There's a couple of hundred mil ion
dollars worth of reef sharks right there.

931
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:33,281
I have a question for you,
young lady.

932
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:37,256
How long were you plotting
to kill Ted Wheetly?

933
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,486
Since that cocksucker
k led my father.

934
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:42,593
Just like Rachel said.

935
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:46,324
Sometimes that lying bitch
told the truth.

936
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,829
So Rachel was trying
to cheat you out of it?

937
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,767
She thought she was so slick.

938
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,669
Hey, one more question.

939
01:16:57,847 --> 01:16:59,974
Linda Dobson disappearing.

940
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:02,310
I could never figure that out.
What was that?

941
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:05,977
No mystery. She needed money
to move to Europe...

942
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,955
...so this was just
the easiest way to get it.

943
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,924
It's always the easy answer, isn't it?

944
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,025
I think we got a live one here!

945
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,689
Yeah.

946
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:23,138
We are gonna be eating fish
for dinner tonight.

947
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,166
We're a whores, aren't we, Frank?

948
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:29,343
What are you doing?
Oh, no.

949
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:31,207
No. No.

950
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,041
No, please.

951
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,683
I'm a greedy bitch.
What did you expect?

952
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:48,722
If you see one of those rich sharks,
maybe it'll buy you a clue.

953
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,559
Asshole!

954
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:55,023
All right, easy, tiger.

955
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:56,289
Money landed?

956
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,558
Yeah, about five minutes ago
it became final.

957
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:02,067
Wheetly Enterprises is dissolved,
all of its assets been dispersed.

958
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,639
One of the larger recipients
was the Cayman Reef Trust...

959
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:10,643
...to be administered without oversight
by its pres dent, yours truly...

960
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:13,407
...and his soon-to-be
smoking-hot wife.

961
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,447
So we're free to grow old...

962
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,280
...fat, and happy?
- Oh, I don't know about that.

963
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:21,252
I have to keep you away from
the lobster buffet, Mrs. Stuben.

964
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:25,153
Can't believe it's over,
after al the planning.

965
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,318
It's, like, finally done.

966
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,588
Is "dead" done enough for you?

967
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:36,331
- It' I stick?
- Whatever Walker got was good.

968
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,473
I'll take that.

969
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:40,632
Jump on. I'll give you a ride home.

970
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,300
Oh, sweetheart, you know
how wobbly my sea legs are.

971
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,846
Come on, baby. I want you to jump on
and drop your anchor on me.

972
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,774
Last one home, slave for a day?

973
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:53,115
- I might just let you win.
- I hope you do.

974
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:17,035
Watch out for that
manifold intake valve.

975
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,609
We did it.

976
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,067
You Brandi?

977
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,380
- Who are you?
- I want to talk about your father.

978
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,743
- He's dead.
- I know.

979
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:59,217
Your father was a good man.
He didn't deserve to die.

980
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:03,587
I'm the guy who's gonna
help you get even.

981
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:05,720
All right.

982
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:08,086
How?

983
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,599
He's just perfect, right?

984
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:38,349
I just can't believe how bad y
your father treated your mother.

985
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,464
She must have felt
there was no other way out.

986
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,735
He's a murderer...

987
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,428
...and nobody is gonna
see it like that.

988
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:55,137
He'll get what's coming to him.
They always do.

989
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,639
Bullshit.

990
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,578
Guy walks on water.

991
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:06,716
You know...

992
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,481
...there is something
you can do about it.

993
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,090
Like what?

994
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,641
Breaking into Shane's garage
is a piece of cake.

995
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:29,277
There's no security, no nothing.

996
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,470
- There's no security.
- None.

997
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:34,013
All you need to do is get his keys...

998
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,014
...and et yourself n
through the door.

999
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,743
How do we get his keys?

1000
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,911
The guy's a total horn dog.

1001
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,147
It shouldn't be too hard.

1002
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:51,662
No... Hey, Hendricks!

1003
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,597
What the hell are you doing
in my home?

1004
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,328
Carson invited me.

1005
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:58,097
Rachel.

1006
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,439
You know that whole boat race
was my idea.

1007
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,009
It doesn't matter.

1008
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:05,009
He's an idiot.

1009
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,309
He's not that bad.

1010
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,713
It's just...

1011
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:19,055
He gets to have all the fun.

1012
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:21,219
You're mad at him.

1013
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,556
Yeah?

1014
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,394
So what?

1015
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:43,510
He gets nothing
unless he gets married.

1016
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,812
He has no interest in that.

1017
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:47,922
What are we supposed to do,
wait 10 years?

1018
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,081
Oh, yeah, right.
Like that will help.

1019
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:51,487
He'll totally cut us out.

1020
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:55,528
Well, then we need to convince him
it's in his best interest to get married.

1021
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,830
Like if he needed to pay me off.

1022
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,497
Like if he didn't, he'd go to jail.

1023
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,700
All right, how?

1024
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,109
I could say he raped me.

1025
01:24:10,746 --> 01:24:11,906
You guys set me up?

1026
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,707
Baby, just re ax.

1027
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,615
Listen, you're not thinking straight.

1028
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:19,083
If we don't get married,
we don't get a penny.

1029
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:22,587
I mean this way, we get
some of the trust every year...

1030
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:27,457
...plus we get a big payout
up front that we can all split.

1031
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:30,894
- I mean, that's a win-win.
- For you. I'm in jail.

1032
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,465
You can get out real easy.

1033
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:35,593
By agreeing to get married.

1034
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:36,965
If you don't...

1035
01:24:37,139 --> 01:24:40,404
...I’m really afraid that Brandi's
gonna go through with those charges.

1036
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,636
She thinks you're gonna
cut her out when you're 30.

1037
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,242
What about your friend, Linda?

1038
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:51,477
- Did you tell her about Dad?
- No, I didn't tell her a thing.

1039
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:55,384
As far as she's concerned
it was a scam to get the estate.

1040
01:24:56,992 --> 01:25:00,985
She just needed cash for,
I don't know, her year abroad.

1041
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:08,833
George, where have you been?

1042
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:10,733
I got here as soon as I could.

1043
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,181
- I'm a little worried.
- About what?

1044
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,452
What if Walker suspects me
for killing Rachel?

1045
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,688
We've been through this. You shoot
her, you feed her to the gators.

1046
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:39,265
Plant the bag in her house
and tip off the police. I know, baby.

1047
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,026
But what if Walker doesn't buy it?

1048
01:25:41,203 --> 01:25:44,297
He seems smarter
than I imagined him to be.

1049
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,464
Then we buy him.

1050
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:51,511
I have known Frank for a while now.
He's as crooked as they come.

1051
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:08,329
Pretty convenient how these
just happened to be there.

1052
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:09,657
She's a bad crook.

1053
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,492
Well, you're worse.

1054
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:14,898
Guy lives next to the cabin, nice
old trucker, invited me for a beer.

1055
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:18,198
He tells me he saw you
this morning carrying that bag.

1056
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:22,070
He remembers you very well because
he almost ran you over one day.

1057
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:28,547
Memory fits you to a tee,
your comp ex on, your height.

1058
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:31,585
His memory is bulletproof.

1059
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:38,215
How would you like
an early retirement, detective?

1060
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:01,442
We did it.

1061
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,621
How about you buy me a drink?

1062
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:15,422
How about buy you
the whole damn bar?
