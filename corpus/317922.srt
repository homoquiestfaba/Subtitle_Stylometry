1
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:14,060
Americans are asking

2
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:16,266
Why do they hate us.

3
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,555
They hate what they see
right here in this chamber.

4
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:23,480
A democratically elected government.

5
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,445
Their leaders are self-appointed.

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,256
They hate our freedoms.

7
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:31,458
Our freedom of religion.

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,418
Our freedom of speech.

9
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,205
Our freedom to vote in assemble
and disagree with each other.

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,200
They went over though existing governments
in many Muslim countries

11
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:46,810
such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.

12
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,917
FATWA
NOUN: a ruling on a point of islamic law
given by a recognized authority

13
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,034
They want to drive Israel
out of the middle east.

14
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:56,015
They want to drive Christians and Jews
out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,096
These terrorists kill not merely to end lives.

16
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:04,966
But to disrupt and
end a way of life.

17
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,114
With every atrocity they hope
that America grows fearful.

18
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:12,510
Retreating from the world
and forsaking our friends.

19
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:16,832
They stand against us because
we stand in their way.

20
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:21,642
We're not received by
their pretenses to piety.

21
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,579
We have seen their kind before.

22
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:29,545
They're the heirs of all the murderer's
ideologies of the 20th century.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,653
By sacrificing human life
to serve their heretical visions.

24
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:37,254
By abandoning every value
except the will to power.

25
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:43,159
They follow in the path of fascism,
Nazism and totalitarianism.

26
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:46,692
And they will follow their path
all the way to where it ends.

27
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:50,608
In history's unmarked grave of discarded lives.

28
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,261
Americans are asking:
How do we fight to win this war?

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,418
No, leave it on, leave it on!

30
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:14,358
What was that miss Goldman?
Oh, you wanna be a volunteer.

31
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:20,363
All right, would you put down the
cigarette for just a moment. Thank you.

32
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,729
The Arabian peninsula has never sensed...

33
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:39,288
The Arabian peninsula has never sensed it.

34
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:42,520
Ring in by deserts and
encircled with seas.

35
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:46,492
Been surrounded by any forces like the
crusade armies spreading in like locust

36
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:48,871
eating its riches and
wiping out its plantations.

37
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:51,873
All this is happening at a
time in which nations

38
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:55,075
are attacking Muslims like people
fighting over a plate of food.

39
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:59,129
In light of the graved situation
and lack of support

40
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:02,807
we and here should
discuss current events

41
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,789
and we should all agree
on unsettled matter.

42
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:07,917
First, for over seven years
the United States

43
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:10,954
has been occupying lands of
Islam and the holiest of places.

44
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,831
The Arabian Peninsula plundering
its riches, dictating to its rulers,

45
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:18,248
simulating against people
terrorising its neighbours

46
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,447
and turning its spaces in
the peninsula into a spearhead

47
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,232
through which to fight the
neighbouring Muslim people.

48
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:28,376
If some people having a pass are
eager of the fact of the occupation

49
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,845
all the people in the peninsula
have now acknowledged it.

50
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:33,936
The best proof...

51
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,758
Put the fucking headphones off!

52
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:43,844
The best proof of this is the Americans are
continuing agression against the Iraqi people.

53
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:48,851
Using a peninsula as a stating
post even though all of its rulers

54
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:53,277
are against their territories being
used to that, but they are helpless.

55
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,407
All these crimes and sins
committed by the Americans

56
00:03:56,442 --> 00:04:01,742
are a clear declaration of war on Allah,
its messenger and Muslims.

57
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:05,534
On that basis and in
compliance with Allah's order

58
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,858
we issue to following fatwa...
- Fatwa.

59
00:04:11,557 --> 00:04:17,495
Fatwa. We issue to following
fatwa to utmost person.

60
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:25,242
The ruling to kill the Americans and
their allies and civilians and military

61
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:29,471
is an individual duty for every Muslim
who can do it in any country

62
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,249
in which it is possible to do it.

63
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,413
Osama Bin Laden, 1998.

64
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,403
Well, that's some tough shit.

65
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,812
Thank you.

66
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,207
A world divided.

67
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:58,354
Therefore the question becomes:
Is it possible to love an enemy who hates you?

68
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:04,077
Or should that enemy be destroyed
before it destroys you?

69
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,425
Need I remind you that our
sovereign shores were corrupted

70
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,078
by an evil that knows no boundaries.

71
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,203
We cannot stand idly by affording our
enemies an opportunity to strike again.

72
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,082
Taking the offensive is not our choice.
It is our solemn duty.

73
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:30,597
Our ethical promise to our children
and to the future of the free world.

74
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,452
Thank you.

75
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,976
- Senator!
- Senator!

76
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,242
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Maggie Davidson.

77
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,334
Thank you.

78
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,446
Twenty-three please.

79
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,942
What's up?

80
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:22,549
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Apology accepted.

81
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:36,125
Excuse me.
Have a nice evening.

82
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,514
Do I know you?

83
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:37,233
Aren't you that woman
that was in the elevator?

84
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:42,047
Is that all I am to you?

85
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,351
Two weeks max.

86
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,607
It's only 14 days.

87
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,367
Such a soft...

88
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,469
- 344 Alexander.
- No.

89
00:11:22,757 --> 00:11:24,741
Out of service.

90
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,854
What the hell do you
have the light on for?

91
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,524
Very sorry friend, out of service.

92
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,244
Grab my throat!

93
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,525
Grab my throat.

94
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:22,743
Put your hands on my throat.

95
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,661
Grab my fucking...

96
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,412
Today in New York Senator Maggie Davidson,

97
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:47,902
a member of the Armed Services Committee came in

98
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:49,967
with her thoughts on
the latest terrorist threat.

99
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,610
I am simply following the will of the people.

100
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:58,036
In this new world civil liberties are challenged,
not by the bureaucrats in Washington.

101
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,946
But by the men hiding in caves.

102
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,459
And for democrats to
use these events to gain

103
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:06,788
traction against me in
this election is without moral.

104
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:08,994
It is simply awful.

105
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:12,407
- Thank you Senator.
- Senator Maggie Davidson!

106
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,566
Men hiding in cave.

107
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,148
I was in cave.

108
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:27,257
Cave men in White House.

109
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:34,496
Cave men in Senate,
cave men in Congress.

110
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,702
Nice shirt by the way.

111
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,079
Clearly none of this leaves this room.

112
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,546
Clearly.

113
00:13:57,582 --> 00:14:02,527
We got a report today from the FBI field office
in New York about Muhammad Fatah.

114
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:06,079
An Al Caeda operative who's
been living here since 1998.

115
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:08,337
He was picked up
last week driving his cab

116
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,064
with close to a thousand
smoke detectors in the trunk.

117
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:13,079
Fire conscious terrorist.

118
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,140
He could have carried less
about the smoke detectors

119
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,097
what he was after was the Cobalt 47.

120
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:30,981
- A new club on 47th street.
- This is why we don't talk.

121
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:33,567
First it's not even funny,
let alone clever.

122
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,047
- Maggie.
- Oh, Vince.

123
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,677
- We both know I'm situationally funny.
- Whatever. Shall I continue?

124
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,957
Oh, please.
Continue, Giggles.

125
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:51,524
Apparently he was trying to extract the
Cobalt 47 from the smoke detectors

126
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,133
in order to build some sort
of radioactive weapon.

127
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,919
- Like nuke?
- Not exactly.

128
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:01,111
But a weapon of mass destruction.

129
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:07,849
- Shall I finish?
- Please continue. Go ahead.

130
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:11,381
He was going to construct
the bomb in a trunk of his cab

131
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,964
and then let it loose
in the financial district.

132
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:17,398
- Killing thousands?
- No.

133
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:20,611
Just the ones in closest
proximity to the blast.

134
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,259
See the blast would trigger
a radiological event.

135
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:26,479
Meaning the toxic particles would
be released into the atmosphere

136
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:31,195
and depending on the weather conditions they
could be carried up to one mile in radius.

137
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,734
Making the financial district
completely wasted.

138
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:42,829
A moment of massive disruption.

139
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:08,582
Hey, what's up man?

140
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,561
Ready for a close-up?

141
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,656
Three, corner pocket.

142
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:37,477
Where's mom?

143
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:42,029
Hi dad, good to see you.
Oh good, that's great.

144
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,995
- What can I do for you, sweetheart?
- I'm going to Noa's.

145
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,655
Call.

146
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,698
Fuck it!

147
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:34,805
Slow down, it's not a race.

148
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:40,072
- Yours or mine?
- Your.

149
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,531
- Hello.
- It's me, you got any money?

150
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:54,810
A little.

151
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:04,707
It's awkward.

152
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:09,529
John, we're not gonna do this again, are we?

153
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:10,893
Do what?

154
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:15,841
I mean Jesus Christ, I'm in the middle
of the toughest campaign of my life.

155
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:19,635
The world is in perpetual crisis,
I just don't need that shit right now!

156
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,941
- They want me?
- Yeah, you got it!

157
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:26,794
- All we have is a photo, you set it yourself!
- Go get fucked.

158
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,218
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do right now!

159
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:33,046
- Fuck you Maggie!
- Oh shit.

160
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,312
If I can get my phone to work
I'm gonna call you from the train, okay?

161
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:41,887
Shit!

162
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:44,950
Look, we just wanna to have
a chit-chat with your husband.

163
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:48,466
He's not my husband for your information.
He's my lover now.

164
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,783
Go away!

165
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,113
You listen to me.

166
00:20:57,148 --> 00:21:01,809
We're still gonna have to come in to
the house and have a chat with Darrel.

167
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,777
Go away!

168
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:07,761
I gotta take this.

169
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:10,445
- You won't work?
- Try to pacify her.

170
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,747
Fuck you! Go!

171
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:15,118
This will go a thousand times smoother
if you just put that blade down.

172
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,707
I'ma put this blade down
cracking your ass nigger!

173
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:20,884
Go with him.

174
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:24,878
- Hello.
- Hello man.

175
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:29,013
- What's up buttercup?
- If this is a bad time I can call you back later.

176
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:34,771
No, it's never a bad time, I'm just
wrapping up something at the office.

177
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:38,217
I'll tell you one more time,
put the blade down.

178
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,763
Put the weapon away and
let me talk to Darrel.

179
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,517
Not in this lifetime, you bitch.

180
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,123
I need you and Grady to come by
on your way home tonight later.

181
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:49,727
- Sounds like official business.
- Something like that.

182
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,773
Now go!
No!

183
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:59,742
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

184
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,155
Give me an hour, okay?

185
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,442
I hope that was important!

186
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:23,447
- Where did she go?
- In a castle to retrieve the prince.

187
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:29,302
- So who was on the phone?
- I'll tell you in the car.

188
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:34,450
Fuck you! Get out!
That motherfucker is your problem now!

189
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,066
Thank you ma'am.

190
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,379
You know what the worst part is?

191
00:22:42,414 --> 00:22:48,901
I just know without the shadow of a duck this
poor son of a bitch doesn't even have the money.

192
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:51,718
Really?

193
00:22:52,977 --> 00:22:55,627
If you don't wanna do it,
I'll do it this time.

194
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,968
No, it's not that.

195
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,361
Hey Darrel.

196
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:06,694
Darrel, look here man.
We work for Mr. Sikle.

197
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,760
We're gonna need to collect
all that loan he gave you.

198
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:13,059
Now where can we go get that money?

199
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:18,822
- So what is it?
- What?

200
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:22,726
- What is it?
- You know...

201
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:27,480
Why can't everybody just
be happy in this world.

202
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:32,457
Look, I'll ask you one more time.
Do you have the 15 grand?

203
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,995
What's the matter with this guy?

204
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,116
Okay man, grab his arm.

205
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,238
We're gonna take a little something, okay?

206
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:49,519
Just to let Al know that
you're good for him.

207
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:08,304
You know I guess it is easier
being a victim.

208
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,529
Gives you real rationalizing
everything in your life.

209
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:17,521
Sir, this will be a show
of good faith for Al.

210
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,188
You did the right thing.

211
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:25,676
Yeah, I'd like to report
a domestic disturbance.

212
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:28,522
I think it got really ugly
next door with my neighbours.

213
00:24:31,328 --> 00:24:34,312
I think the guy needs
an ambulance right away.

214
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:41,954
8714 Intech road. Hurry please.

215
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,669
Some sitting on my hood again!

216
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:28,368
First trust into Allah and peace be
onto our prophet Muhammad.

217
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:38,998
Who said: I have been sent to this world between my
hands to ensure that no one but Allah is worshipped.

218
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:44,365
Allah, who put my livelihood under my spear

219
00:25:45,308 --> 00:25:56,649
and who inflicts humiliation and scone
on those who disobey my words.

220
00:25:58,331 --> 00:26:02,123
This is another treat.

221
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:09,194
This is a treat.
This is not a trade.

222
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:17,925
This is I...

223
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:25,179
I'll blow up National tomorrow.

224
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:47,004
- So we're going for a ride?
- I don't know.

225
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,748
Would you cut the bullshit?
Something must be totally fucked up.

226
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,720
- I mean why else would we be here?
- Why does something have to be fucked up?

227
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,962
Because we're in the fucked up business.

228
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,438
- What?
- You know what I mean.

229
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,483
No, I don't.

230
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:10,416
I don't know. You fancy yourself smart
enough to have that cut both ways.

231
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:19,492
- Man, this shit must never get old.
- Being rich. He wouldn't fucking know.

232
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,077
What kind of vague shit is that?

233
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:28,636
You know the cliche:
"Rich in a wallet, poor in the spirit".

234
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,827
- Yeah, I'd take that life.
- Oh yeah?

235
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,191
- The more you have the more you have to protect.
- That's true.

236
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:40,114
Yet somehow I doubt that we're about
to be engaged in the protection business.

237
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:43,599
Well there are more of than
two ways to skin a cat.

238
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,312
AMMONIUM NITRATE

239
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:00,535
I'm so fucked up.

240
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:04,130
- What is it you think?
- I don't care a thing.

241
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:54,851
How much?

242
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,972
Maybe a line, I don't know.

243
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,328
See if anything fell in the cab.

244
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:07,454
Call him.

245
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,599
- What terrorist?
- Yeah, terrorist.

246
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,433
I have to go get my phone.

247
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:48,759
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

248
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,475
Always my girl.

249
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:54,136
- No.
- You are.

250
00:31:55,895 --> 00:32:00,455
- How long do you want to go?
- A couple of them.

251
00:32:03,058 --> 00:32:04,839
I'll call you back.

252
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:45,567
He'll call back.

253
00:32:49,796 --> 00:32:50,867
What's that?

254
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:54,177
I think it's my sister's military ID.

255
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,530
- She's a hotty.
- She was.

256
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,967
Tell me you have good news.

257
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:26,037
- Tomorrow we're having it.
- Thank you Osama!

258
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,135
Good night my son.

259
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:17,826
Hey little brother.

260
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:20,363
What's the matter moonlight
is hurting your eyes?

261
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:24,796
- Sorry I called you so late.
- I know you're not.

262
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,224
- It's been too long.
- Yeah.

263
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,423
I thought maybe we take a little ride.

264
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:42,002
- I thought that was our lines.
- Funny! That was funny!

265
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:00,438
How fucking high are you?

266
00:35:12,177 --> 00:35:15,104
- I miss her sometimes.
- What was that?

267
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:18,056
Nothing, nothing.

268
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:24,258
- What was she like?
- She was a lot like you actually.

269
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:30,327
Moral conviction and civil duty.

270
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,491
Fuck her.

271
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:47,536
You know what, fuck her!
She never really believed.

272
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,257
No one ever really does, they...

273
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,104
They just fight because
their parents fought.

274
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:04,711
We're forced to hate one another.

275
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:09,774
We're not taught to love.

276
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,180
Whatever the fuck with it.

277
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:36,466
A world without God
is a world devoid of war.

278
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,571
Do you think you really could have done that?

279
00:36:44,372 --> 00:36:45,060
What?

280
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,037
Far from God.

281
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:55,694
You didn't even think he existed.

282
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,428
Maybe if I did in two weeks

283
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,080
I'll start sleeping with Jesus.

284
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:11,742
Why, could you?

285
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:22,025
- Why do you think I'm here?
- You're really draft toucher.

286
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,079
Put it there!

287
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:40,019
- Man, this must never get old.
- What's that?

288
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:43,971
All this, I mean knowing that all this is yours.

289
00:37:46,412 --> 00:37:48,419
You got rocks in your house man.

290
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:50,408
All my rocks are outside.

291
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:58,063
- It is great.
- Yeah, it's home.

292
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:02,039
Home sweet home.

293
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:04,965
Home on the range.

294
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:21,159
I'm not totally sure how this works
but I think I have a job for you.

295
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:26,050
What kind of job is that?

296
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:33,770
I need somebody...
I'm not exactly sure how to say this.

297
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:37,893
- Removed?
- Something like that.

298
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:44,654
Have you ever engaged anybody
in something like this before?

299
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,085
No.

300
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,460
Pretty straightforward.

301
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:54,050
You just give us who, when, how.
We give you a price.

302
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:56,000
The moment you paid
it's a done deal.

303
00:38:58,986 --> 00:39:00,451
Who and when I can give you.

304
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,930
Fuck.

305
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:41,545
- What is this fucking joke?
- You're the funny one, tell me.

306
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:45,990
You're the funny one. You tell me.

307
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:51,862
You look at me.
You look at me.

308
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,097
- I can't live like this anymore.
- I can't do this.

309
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:06,483
- I have no place else to go Bobby.
- Try a fucking marriage counsellor!

310
00:40:06,518 --> 00:40:08,219
Do you know where that bitch is right now?

311
00:40:08,254 --> 00:40:11,081
Do you know what she's done to me? Do you?

312
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:14,341
Look at it! Fucking look at it!

313
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,216
I am done.

314
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:28,743
This is the only way.

315
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:33,299
Look I haven't had a chance to
council with my business partner.

316
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,540
Cut the fucking bullshit!

317
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:38,990
How in the hell are we supposed
to pull off something like this anyway?

318
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,222
Doesn't she have some
kind of a security?

319
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:44,204
Sometimes she goes
on these trips by herself.

320
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:49,918
Hypothetically speaking,
how?

321
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:57,083
Doesn't really matter.
There's a fly. Timeframe.

322
00:40:57,118 --> 00:41:01,290
Let me guess. You need
this done say, tomorrow?

323
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:03,726
Not bad.

324
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:07,821
Let me get this straight.

325
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:17,763
You want us to put a hit on my sister-in-law,
a US Senator in 24 hours.

326
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,497
Yeah, that's right.
Everything you need is in there.

327
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,090
- I can't do it.
- I was afraid of that.

328
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,048
Come on.

329
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:45,713
This is fucking bullshit.

330
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,101
Let's play the fucking pool game.

331
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:52,510
Just take it easy.

332
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,088
Watch this baby.

333
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:15,812
- I love you, little man.
- I love you too man.

334
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:14,996
Fucking stupid!

335
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:31,914
It's so fucking stupid.

336
00:43:32,773 --> 00:43:35,381
It's so fucking stupid!

337
00:43:37,305 --> 00:43:39,032
He was my god, man.

338
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,901
She gets back tomorrow early evening.

339
00:45:12,936 --> 00:45:16,297
She always travels back alone
same pattern every time.

340
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:18,909
She gets in the cab lines,
she grabs a cab.

341
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:20,593
She's on that way.

342
00:45:20,628 --> 00:45:26,040
- What a fuck are you talking about.
- Nothing. All right? Nothing! Either way.

343
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:31,801
I'm just saying that if we took the job,
it wouldn't be that complicated.

344
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:35,081
Oh yeah, not that complicated.

345
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:39,173
Do I need to remind you that
she is a United States Senator?

346
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,553
- And she killed him.
- No.

347
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,778
He killed himself.

348
00:45:45,418 --> 00:45:50,961
He killed himself with my fucking gun
in his own fucking house!

349
00:45:53,310 --> 00:46:00,588
With what? Like million fucking dollars
in cash he got from fuck knows where!

350
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:08,008
- What's so damn funny?
- I don't know, it's so funny.

351
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,428
Don't I look cute today, honey?

352
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:24,596
Do I have a choice?

353
00:46:25,937 --> 00:46:27,752
Do you have a choice?

354
00:46:29,316 --> 00:46:32,494
I am struggling to find another option.

355
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:35,650
- Then fucking walk out of here!
- I don't want to walk!

356
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:41,811
I can walk no problem.
I'm done. I'm gone.

357
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:43,004
But you.

358
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:52,460
- How hard can it be, right?
- Simple on pape.

359
00:46:56,771 --> 00:47:01,251
Sits gets in a cab, usually
makes a couple of stops.

360
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:04,265
Before ending up down here.

361
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:13,769
So in a quiet moment
we do a hit and disappear.

362
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:12,551
- Is this my phone?
- As far as I know.

363
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:15,623
Can't make that mistake again.

364
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:21,966
Max.

365
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:23,908
- Don't.
- What?

366
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,099
It's not you.

367
00:48:28,898 --> 00:48:31,728
- You know what, I'll leave first.
- No, it's okay.

368
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:34,361
I wanna make a stop
before I get to the train.

369
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:39,974
- Are you still on the four o'clock?
- Yeah, why are you so concerned what train I'm on?

370
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:41,788
Just wanna make sure you're safe, that's all.

371
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:44,651
Well I'm gonna check this stuff
downstairs if that's okay with you.

372
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,016
I loved you.

373
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,155
No, you didn't.

374
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:19,023
She's out.

375
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,109
May I check these with you for a while?

376
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:34,360
Thank you.

377
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,917
I'm so sorry,
I didn't see you.

378
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,599
- I didn't see you either.
- Are you all right?

379
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,789
Yes I'll be fine, thank you.

380
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:26,944
You have the money?

381
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:51,230
Why do you pay me
to have sex with her?

382
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:54,257
When really all you want is to fuck me?

383
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,421
You're tired, aren't you?

384
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:14,473
Lie back.

385
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:11,762
So what is it you say
about your grandfather?

386
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:14,749
You know my granddad
worked at the train station.

387
00:52:14,784 --> 00:52:17,637
- Like you.
- We're keeping in the family.

388
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,726
Following the footsteps.

389
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:25,713
- So what?
- He worked there like 34 years.

390
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:27,599
- His name was Hermann.
- Hermann.

391
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:30,403
They called him George.

392
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,872
Morning George.

393
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:37,829
- Those are my bags, George.
- Why George? Not Hermann?

394
00:52:37,864 --> 00:52:40,799
They didn't respect the dude enough
to call him by his first name.

395
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,633
But why George?

396
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,222
I don't know why George but
it just wasn't Hermann, that's the deal.

397
00:52:47,257 --> 00:52:48,333
Because why?

398
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,609
You ain't been here long enough,
that's the way it works sometimes.

399
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:56,817
His name was Hermann,
but they called him George.

400
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:02,595
You're totally fucking cute man!
That's how it works.

401
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,988
- Okay, thanks George.
- Shit!

402
00:53:08,323 --> 00:53:11,482
Hold on, vibrate.
Hold on.

403
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,305
There she goes!

404
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:36,069
Aren't you...

405
00:53:36,104 --> 00:53:38,285
Senator Maggie Davidson,
great to meet you.

406
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:40,594
It looks great.

407
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:42,819
It's not for me,
it's for my daughter.

408
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:44,709
Excuse me.

409
00:53:52,181 --> 00:53:56,189
Hey. I was just going to call you,
I'm looking at a dress for you.

410
00:53:56,224 --> 00:54:00,169
- Great. Where's dad?
- Did you try at the office?

411
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:05,480
- Yes they said he took a day off.
- Maybe he's playing golf, I don't know.

412
00:54:05,515 --> 00:54:09,414
- Is something wrong?
- I just need some cash.

413
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:12,305
- For what?
- Crack.

414
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:14,546
Seriously.

415
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:19,652
Seriously I'm trying to buy tickets for a show
from Noa's brother and it takes some cash.

416
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:22,504
If you can't find your dad's
why don't you just go over to the house

417
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:24,167
and take whatever you
need from my stash?

418
00:54:24,774 --> 00:54:26,887
- I love you mom.
- I love you too.

419
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:30,028
Oh, and we're starting family
dinners again tomorrow night.

420
00:54:30,063 --> 00:54:32,743
So keep your schedule clear.

421
00:54:37,379 --> 00:54:38,455
Done.

422
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:04,440
Put that thing back in your pants.

423
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:12,924
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, what are you doing here?

424
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:16,796
They asked me to keep an eye
on the place for a couple of days.

425
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:18,717
You remember Noa?

426
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:21,302
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:55:25,524 --> 00:55:26,691
Sorry.

428
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:28,073
You're so disgusting.

429
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:30,281
You look really tired.

430
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,961
That's because I was dreaming about you.

431
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,657
That's exhausting.

432
00:55:35,797 --> 00:55:39,105
Tell him to close his eyes.
I don't trust him.

433
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:40,879
Just close your eyes, okay?

434
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:54,173
- He didn't do it, did he?
- No.

435
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:00,683
- So how long you're staying?
- Just another half an hour.

436
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:06,934
- You can't stay for a dip?
- A dip in what?

437
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,889
All right, you close the
door after you, okay?

438
00:56:12,924 --> 00:56:15,938
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

439
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,087
- Look at you.
- No, look at you.

440
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:22,126
Cassie old grown-up.

441
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:27,645
B wake up. We got ten minutes.
Let's roll, come on get up.

442
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,127
Coffee. Coffee man, come on.

443
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:37,679
Hey, check out the safe.

444
00:56:42,364 --> 00:56:46,976
- What's the combo?
- 57191.

445
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:01,239
We're gonna need all we can get.

446
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:20,530
Call your boy. Tell him to visit my house.

447
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:24,976
Yeah.

448
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:30,438
- Hey. We're still on for tonight?
- I'll be there around nine.

449
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:33,809
- I'll call first.
- Okay, grab a pen.

450
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:39,684
87 Wiskonsin north-west.

451
00:57:40,664 --> 00:57:42,509
Don't be frightened by
all the white people.

452
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:09,300
Wanna grab a bite?

453
01:02:18,162 --> 01:02:20,511
Hello boys, are we smoking today?

454
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:24,101
- I don't think so.
- Right this way.

455
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:37,419
- No smoking.
- I ain't smoking.

456
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:42,378
My name is Sandy.
I'll be moonlighting as your waitress.

457
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:47,812
- Can I get you boys a shake?
- Vanilla for me, chocolate for my friend.

458
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,371
Cause it to black thing baby.

459
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,175
You see this guy at the counter?

460
01:02:58,835 --> 01:02:59,878
Which one?

461
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:02,625
Which one of these things
is not like the others?

462
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:06,196
Okay what about him?

463
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:08,776
You think he wants what we want?

464
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:12,929
- What do we want?
- I think he got here all alone.

465
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:14,501
This guy he don't wanna be a freak.

466
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,247
He don't?

467
01:03:18,178 --> 01:03:21,529
See, we brought up in this
country to live for ourselves.

468
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:25,411
But they live for God.

469
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:29,789
You know it's duty versus free will and shit.

470
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:32,276
When did you learn how to read?

471
01:03:56,835 --> 01:04:00,146
Okay cutie pies, you're
ready or you need a few?

472
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:03,890
- I don't know, we'll take it later.
- All right, I'll be back in a flash.

473
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:11,531
- Here's a fresh one.
- Thanks.

474
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:20,945
I was thinking that maybe I would
like a big slice of apple pie.

475
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,106
- With the scoop?
- Scoop, yeah.

476
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:30,203
- What's the occasion?
- Big day.

477
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:31,625
Good for you.

478
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:36,840
Big day for me.

479
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:48,647
- What's the story morning glory?
- You again.

480
01:04:49,557 --> 01:04:55,218
Sandy, give me your story.
The whole novel.

481
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,054
Well, you know the deal.

482
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:02,892
Working my way through Georgetown law,
do double shifts and all that.

483
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:06,679
That's great, just what the world
needs now, another fucking lawyer.

484
01:05:06,714 --> 01:05:09,788
With relative moral conviction.
Thank you.

485
01:05:12,477 --> 01:05:14,145
Are you guys gonna order or what?

486
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,679
Yeah, bring us two biggers
burgers you can master. Huge.

487
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:20,071
- You're sure you're gonna handle it?
- Bring it on.

488
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,388
Why don't you be nice to this girl man?
What's you thinking about?

489
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,382
She's the fucking lawyer.
We're fucking criminals.

490
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,375
She ain't does shit.
Leave her a nice tip.

491
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:00,684
Groovy.

492
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:03,286
You boys need anything else?
Give me a shout.

493
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,263
Are you kidding me?

494
01:06:07,053 --> 01:06:09,786
Let's see you exercise
your free will with that.

495
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:12,893
Only in America.

496
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,233
- You're sure you can do this?
- What? Eat the burger?

497
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:23,809
- Come on man stop playing.
- There is no choice.

498
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:26,686
I gotta ask.

499
01:06:49,566 --> 01:06:50,710
Good.

500
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:57,590
You know, there is much
I missed in this life.

501
01:07:00,008 --> 01:07:01,632
But I won't miss this.

502
01:07:27,105 --> 01:07:30,439
- Guy's just trying to make a little.
- Trying to appear to.

503
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:36,048
- You always see the glass is half empty.
- Rarely why you can see the glass.

504
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,282
You boys behave.

505
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:02,952
You do right by the world.

506
01:09:00,342 --> 01:09:02,223
John it's me. I'm back in town.

507
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,766
Cassie was looking for you they
said you were at the office today.

508
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:14,500
John, I don't wanna fight anymore.

509
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:18,042
I know you think we can't
get back to that place, but...

510
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:31,240
Call me when you get this, okay?

511
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,862
Man, that feeling good.

512
01:09:41,003 --> 01:09:43,472
There's only one cop
work in the line.

513
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,767
Pretty fucking amazing.

514
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:09,748
No, man!

515
01:10:15,007 --> 01:10:16,417
Thanks, George.

516
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:25,079
Thanks, George.

517
01:10:47,963 --> 01:10:51,977
- So where to this evening?
- I have to make two stops if that's okay.

518
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:53,443
You're the boss.

519
01:10:53,478 --> 01:10:55,122
Just head towards north-west.

520
01:10:55,157 --> 01:10:58,142
When we get closer I'll tell you where
to turn so we can go up to Connecticut.

521
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:08,405
Samir, is that how you
pronounce your name?

522
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:10,498
Samir.

523
01:11:11,602 --> 01:11:13,744
Could you turn this off please?

524
01:11:22,868 --> 01:11:27,133
- Did it rain here yesterday?
- No, did it rain in New York?

525
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:28,649
No.

526
01:11:32,393 --> 01:11:34,277
How did you know I was
coming from New York?

527
01:11:37,908 --> 01:11:43,611
Shoes. Only in New York where
the people wear those shoes.

528
01:11:44,737 --> 01:11:46,616
That pretentious, ha?

529
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:53,564
When you do what I do as long as I do, you can
always tell when the Washingtonians come back.

530
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:00,533
- Where are you from?
- Libia.

531
01:12:00,568 --> 01:12:03,639
- When did you come over?
- Ten years ago.

532
01:12:04,275 --> 01:12:06,955
- By yourself?
- Something like that.

533
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:12,408
- No family?
- They didn't make it.

534
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:15,454
I'm sorry.

535
01:12:15,489 --> 01:12:21,096
Yes, they were supposed to drive me
when I became... how do you say

536
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:23,577
...established.

537
01:12:35,203 --> 01:12:40,672
My name is Maggie by the way,
I didn't mean to offend you in any way.

538
01:12:40,707 --> 01:12:43,241
No, you have not offended me, Maggie.

539
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,140
So when is he coming?

540
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:55,031
I don't know.
I guess at 9 o'clock.

541
01:13:03,325 --> 01:13:05,884
Your mom is so fucking hot.

542
01:13:08,282 --> 01:13:11,177
How devastating she'd be
if she found out what we're doing?

543
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:13,382
She'd only care if the press found out.

544
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:16,334
Senator's daughter caught doing Bin Laden.

545
01:13:20,174 --> 01:13:22,055
- It's kind of fucked up.
- What?

546
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,646
- Nothing.
- What?

547
01:13:26,681 --> 01:13:30,348
You don't think it really
comes from Bin Laden?

548
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:32,844
You're such an idiot, no!

549
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:39,892
Now can you just call
your boyfriend please?

550
01:13:41,609 --> 01:13:45,496
I am ready to get high!

551
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:58,816
- Where the fuck are you?
- Around.

552
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,598
Then hurry up.
Or no soup for you.

553
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:09,726
I know, I am sorry.
I forgot, I forgot.

554
01:14:09,761 --> 01:14:16,112
I'm sorry. Yes, honey.
I love you. I'll try.

555
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,912
I'll try, I'm working.

556
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:25,733
Everything all right?

557
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:32,418
Maggie could we make a quick stop?
My girlfriend is sick and...

558
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:39,139
I have a medicine.

559
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:45,902
I'll give you a free ride.

560
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:53,515
- I guess that would be all right.
- It's very nice of you. You understand.

561
01:14:56,619 --> 01:15:01,859
Hey, this is beautiful building, this one.
US Capitol.

562
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,683
- Five minutes, thumbs.
- Take your time.

563
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:26,349
I've got inride entertainment.

564
01:15:51,886 --> 01:15:53,819
Let me see what we got here.

565
01:15:54,756 --> 01:15:55,461
No.

566
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,344
No.

567
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,643
It's our special delivery.

568
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:58,787
I brought it.

569
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:14,728
- It's good?
- It's bad.

570
01:17:21,682 --> 01:17:22,931
- This.
- Yeah.

571
01:18:27,544 --> 01:18:29,951
No!

572
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,840
Cassie!

573
01:18:50,396 --> 01:18:51,231
No!

574
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,513
- What are you doing?
- Something's wrong.

575
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:47,236
- What a fuck are you talking about?
- She was kicking at the window.

576
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:51,208
- So you think she knew...
- No! He won't let you to open her fucking door.

577
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:53,317
Get out.

578
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:55,223
What are you talking about?

579
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,805
You stay with the cab,
follow the fucking cab.

580
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:01,559
I'm gonna check this shit out.
I'll call you.

581
01:20:12,075 --> 01:20:14,408
Why! Tell me why!

582
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,659
You live by your soul.

583
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:20,373
I don't know what you're talking about.

584
01:20:21,054 --> 01:20:24,786
I had a child.

585
01:20:27,602 --> 01:20:30,640
I don't know what you're talking about!

586
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,739
Do not dare.

587
01:20:35,716 --> 01:20:37,127
Do not dare.

588
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:02,988
I'm sorry!

589
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:07,798
I'm sorry for whatever it is you think
I've done to you! I'm so sorry!

590
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:12,485
Do you not know that when
your foster hand of the world

591
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,604
against innocent that
there will be no retribution.

592
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:37,906
You are not justified!

593
01:21:44,143 --> 01:21:44,806
Stop it!

594
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:47,309
Don't do that again!

595
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:48,984
Stop it!

596
01:21:52,423 --> 01:21:56,790
Shoes! You have shoes!
The rest of the world is barefoot!

597
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:03,476
You are just like those criminals
that blew the plane in these towers!

598
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:06,878
You're just like the criminals in towers.

599
01:22:07,534 --> 01:22:10,177
No. No.

600
01:22:11,703 --> 01:22:17,000
I am a mother who watched
her daughter murdered.

601
01:22:22,717 --> 01:22:25,538
I am a father who wants justice.

602
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:30,517
Justice because you killed my child.

603
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:54,247
Where are we going?

604
01:22:57,609 --> 01:23:01,437
You will see free light.

605
01:23:02,569 --> 01:23:04,881
No! No!

606
01:23:27,392 --> 01:23:31,167
- I can get you anything you want.
- You Americans.

607
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,188
- Anything.
- You can't play God.

608
01:23:41,192 --> 01:23:42,625
Give him life!

609
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,787
A sweet boy!

610
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:48,548
You take his life!
I take your life!

611
01:23:50,574 --> 01:23:52,042
This sweet boy!

612
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,276
Don't do that again!

613
01:24:31,508 --> 01:24:32,673
The lipstick.

614
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:33,883
Fuck you!

615
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:40,588
I have a bomb in a cab.

616
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:46,200
And unless you want your President
to die I suggest that you get your lipstick.

617
01:24:46,235 --> 01:24:47,591
Get your lipstick!

618
01:24:59,773 --> 01:25:00,996
Bomb!

619
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:57,114
And if you would be so kind miss Davidson.

620
01:25:57,992 --> 01:25:59,106
Thank you.

621
01:26:07,387 --> 01:26:10,293
Another way that you
love your enemy is this:

622
01:26:10,328 --> 01:26:14,205
When the opportuny presents itself
for you to defeat your enemy.

623
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,623
That is a time which
you must not do it.

624
01:26:17,389 --> 01:26:22,096
There will come a time and many instances,
when the person who hates you most,

625
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:26,982
the person who has misused you most,
the person who has gossipped about you most.

626
01:26:31,404 --> 01:26:36,693
There will come a time when you will have
an opportunity to defeat that person.

627
01:26:36,728 --> 01:26:40,104
There is a reccommendation.

628
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:46,434
You might be in terms of helping that
person to make some move in life.

629
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:48,292
That's the time you must do it.

630
01:26:49,057 --> 01:26:52,634
That is the meaning of love.

631
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:01,971
Love is creative, understanding.
Good will for all men.

632
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:05,187
It is a refusal to defeat individual.

633
01:27:05,864 --> 01:27:09,874
When you rise to the level of love
in which great beauty and power

634
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:12,867
you seek only to defeat evil systems.

635
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:17,320
Individuals who haven't been caught up
in that system you love,

636
01:27:17,355 --> 01:27:19,703
but you seek to defeat the system.

637
01:27:20,085 --> 01:27:25,124
I have a dream
