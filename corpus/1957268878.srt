129
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:14,366
and I could barely
touch the bottom,

130
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,835
and... I hit
my head on something,

131
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,272
so I don't really
remember what happened,

132
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:23,742

my friend pulled me out.

to me to tell my parents about it.

big deal, if you don't acknowledge it?

Like when a kid hits its head and you
laugh so it doesn't cry and freak out.

Yes, exactly. Exactly.

138
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,534
You know, I think I was kind
of that way after my surgery,

139
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:53,672
I was, like,
in so much physical pain,

140
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:58,377
but I was just completely casual
about how I was suffering.

141
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,780
It was like
the mental anguish was enough,

142
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:03,282
that I didn't know how to...

143
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,552
like, deal
with my physical pain,

144
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,288
so I just, like, didn't
acknowledge it. [chuckles]

145
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,824
I just put it in a box,
put it to the side,

146
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,927
didn't think about it,
said, "I'll talk to you later."

147
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,030
- You can deal with pain for, like, 30 seconds.
- Yeah.

148
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,965
Like anyone, any kind of pain.

149
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:24,203
But then 30 seconds
becomes 30 minutes,

150
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,506
and then... 30 minutes
becomes a month,

151
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,277
and then a month becomes...
years later.

152
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,881

talking about my pain.

- No, it's no problem.

close the blinds.

a medium pepperoni pizza,
with extra cheese?

361
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:34,233

- No, hold on, look. Okay.

00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,096
Is this a Veronica stop?

she thought it was this cool idea,

- to leave just this little piece of her everywhere she went.
- Hmm.

wreck thing she was telling you about.

My sister and I
were on our way to Portland.

this city and wanted to see it.

Wait, that wasn't
your question, um...

979
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:17,336
To answer your question, yes.
This is my first time here.

980
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,571
Yeah.

981

982

I can't imagine losing Mads.

983
00:56:29,148 --> 00:56:33,319
Yeah, Mads is special.
She's been a really good friend to me.

984
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:35,788
- You raised her right.
- Oh, we raised each other.

985
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,123
- I'm only five years older.
- Only?

986
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:40,693
Veronica and I were
five years apart. I was older.

987
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:43,962
We had great parents and
I still feel like I raised her.

988
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,765
You know, I think it's just
this older sibling thing.

989
00:56:46,898 --> 00:56:48,300
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah.

990
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:51,170
Responsibility's kind
of driven into us, huh?

991
00:56:51,303 --> 00:56:52,304
Exactly.

992
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,576
Hey, um, Junior?

993
00:56:58,477 --> 00:57:00,579
You aren't even
in the shower yet!

994
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:04,516
Yeah, I know. Um, can I talk
to you in the bedroom?

995
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:08,420

- No! That's all you, babe.

1002

- Vermont.

- Miles thinks that I need to face her.

1007
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,934
And so, he... he booked
a plane ticket, and...

1008
00:57:56,935 --> 00:57:58,270
I'm going to go see her.

1009
00:57:59,204 --> 00:58:02,441
Wow. M... Mads, that's huge.

1010
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:03,908
When are you going?

1011
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:08,514
Tomorrow, at noon.

1012
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:13,786
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1013
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:17,356
- Junior, I'm sorry.
- We're 1,000 miles from LA, Mads!

1014
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,691
Junior, I know that.
I know that. I'm so sorry.

1015
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:22,761
- I just... [stutters]
- Why can't you wait till we get back to LA,

1016
00:58:22,895 --> 00:58:26,064
- then go to Vermont?
- I get it. But look, I know you think my jobs are stupid.

1017
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:29,968
Okay? But...
but I need them to pay my bills,

1018
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:31,970
and I can't get
any more time off.

1019
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:36,475
[sighs] Alright, even I know
that's bullshit, but...

1020
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:39,211
[tense music]

1021
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:42,714
It's now or never.
Okay? Because...

1022
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:46,618
if I don't do it now,
I never will.

1023
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:49,054
And I need to know why,
okay? It...

1024
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:52,291
It's the same as this trip for you and
Veronica. You know, you have to heal...

1025
00:58:52,424 --> 00:58:55,427
- It is not the same!
- Yes, it is! Okay? It doesn't matter

1026
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:58,030
the catalyst for hurting,
the healing is the same.

1027
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,700
Ugh, I don't want your fortune cookie
shit, save it for your mommy.

1028
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:05,037
Oh, Junior, come on! Stop!
I know this sucks,

1029
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,738
but why are you
so mad at me about this?

1030
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:10,309
Because you're abandoning me,
when I need you the most!

1031
00:59:10,442 --> 00:59:12,377
This whole trip
has been about you!

1032
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,247
I didn't even go to the library,
because of you!

1033
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,617
- What library?
- In Salt Lake City.

1034
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:24,857
Oh... [stutters] I... I didn't get
that that meant so much to you,

1035
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:27,526
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever. You're just like everybody else.

1036
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:31,530
Everybody who? Who else?
And you can't say your parents.

1037
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:34,867
- Oh, you're one to talk, little girl.
- [stutters and sighs]

1038
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:40,606
Look, Junior. I think that you use
me as a crutch. You don't need me.

1039
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:43,242
I didn't know Veronica,
and maybe...

1040
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,577
and maybe it makes more sense
that you do this alone.

1041
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:49,915
I can't believe you're turning this around
like, "Oh, it's a great idea to do it alone."

1042
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,285
- It has nothing to do with your selfish agenda!
- My selfish agenda?

1043
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:56,522
This has to do with my mom,
who's alive, by the way.

1044
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:59,157
- Bring it back in, Mads.
- No, don't.

1045
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:01,527
- She's acting like a child.
- So are you.

1046
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,330
Whose side are you on?

1047
01:00:05,932 --> 01:00:08,233
Don't do that, alright?
You sound like Mom right now.

1048
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,770
Are you just going to swing from left to
right on the pendulum, just like that?

1049
01:00:14,606 --> 01:00:16,675
Look, I think
you should apologize, okay?

1050
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,979
- Don't you?
- [sighs]

1051
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:24,583
- No, Junior, just stop. Stop, okay? Wait.
- Nope.

1052
01:00:26,151 --> 01:00:28,053
- [door shuts]
- What, you're just going to let her leave?

1053
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:29,821
Obviously she needs to cool off.

1054
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:31,123
If I go after her,

1055
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,891
we're just going to yell
at each other.

1056
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:36,361
She just...
needs her alone time.

1057
01:00:37,964 --> 01:00:39,298
Yeah, don't we all.

I wasn't a teenager like you.

that she put us in that car

that one night,
to go chase after, uh...

- The guy... Tony.

- With that ugly red hat he wears around.
- [stutters] Yes!

Oh, my God. What did it say?
It had something about, like...

1102

- [laughing] Konkey Donk on it or something.
- I... it was some bar, or some...

- I don't know.
- Oh, God. Oh, I hated that hat.

1104
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:57,063
Yeah, I knew way back then that
she would never put us first.

How could you know
in South Dakota?

1122
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,165
How could you travel
1,200 miles with me,

1123
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:09,734
just sitting next to me,
knowing you were about to dump me?

1124
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:12,205
It's not like that, okay?
It's not... like I said,

1125
01:05:12,337 --> 01:05:14,639
I didn't know that that Miles
was going to go look for her.

1126
01:05:14,773 --> 01:05:17,609
- I didn't know that he was going to find her and...
- I just thought our friendship,

1127
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:20,445
and our relationship
as friends was past you lying.

1128
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:24,683
- I don't know who you are.
- Okay, at the beginning of the trip,

1129
01:05:24,816 --> 01:05:26,953
I didn't know any of this
was going to happen, okay?

1130
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:29,888
But now that it has,
I have to try.

1131
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:34,093
I need... I need
to look her in the eyes, okay?

1132
01:05:34,227 --> 01:05:36,628
I need to ask her why,
and I need to just...

1133
01:05:37,196 --> 01:05:40,765
I need to yell at her.
I need to get out of this...

1134
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:43,568
this in-between place between
being a teenager, an adult

1135
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:45,704
and wherever I am, okay?

1136
01:05:46,272 --> 01:05:48,941
[sighs] You know that...
that space that you were in,

1137
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,043
where...
when you were being diagnosed,

1138
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:54,981
those two years where you had
all those unanswered questions.

1139
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:58,117
I haven't seen
this woman for ten years,

1140

of unanswered questions.

I can't believe you're going to
minimize my own pain and suffering,

1142
01:06:04,257 --> 01:06:07,126
- just to justify your own. That's gross!
- No...

1143
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:10,329
No, that's... [groans] I don't...
that's not what I'm saying, okay?

1144
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:13,832
That's not... I'm get...
this is coming out all wrong.

1145
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:16,835
I don't mean to minimize
what you're going through, okay?

1146
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:19,771
I just... [sighs]

1147
01:06:24,076 --> 01:06:27,013
I wouldn't have been able to
do this three years ago, okay?

1148
01:06:27,146 --> 01:06:30,749
I wouldn't have been able to even
talk to that woman, much less see her.

1149
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:33,585
Okay? I can't imagine
what you go through,

1150
01:06:33,718 --> 01:06:35,754
and you have to be
so strong to do what you do

1151
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:38,057
on a day-to-day basis, and...

1152
01:06:40,393 --> 01:06:44,496
[sighs] It sounds stupid, but I wouldn't
have been able to do this without you.

1153
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:48,034
Mads...

1154
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:52,204
I don't want
to stand in your way.

1155
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:56,976
I just don't know
why you have to abandon me.

1156
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:01,546
I'm not abandoning you.

1157
01:07:03,648 --> 01:07:05,117
You don't need me.

1158
01:07:06,018 --> 01:07:08,486
I know that you think you do,
but you don't.

1159
01:07:12,224 --> 01:07:13,259
You're right.

1160
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,062

1163
01:07:23,035 --> 01:07:24,070

I don't want to get in
the middle of this thing, but...

1169
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:56,068
I just know that Mads is trying.

1170
01:07:57,836 --> 01:08:01,007
Alright? This isn't
an easy decision for her and...

1171
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:05,543
And to be honest,
I pushed her to make it.

1172
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:09,647
So if you're going to be mad at
someone, don't just be mad at her.

1173
01:08:15,054 --> 01:08:16,654
Why does it have to happen now?

1174
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:20,159
I went to South Dakota,
South Dakota!

1175
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:23,062
She promised me that drive home.

1176
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:28,533
You realize now I have to drive
that road where my sister died.

1177
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,503
I have to do that alone.

1178
01:08:31,303 --> 01:08:33,205
- And you're scared?
- Of course I am.

1179
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:34,606
So is she.

1180
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:37,609
Can you not see that?

1181
01:08:42,281 --> 01:08:45,917
Has Mads ever talked to you
about her fear of not being seen?

1182
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,524
It started after she got sick.
She said to me, "I'm invisible.

1183
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:54,994
This disease
makes people not see me."

1184
01:08:59,597 --> 01:09:02,001
Yeah, I know that feeling.

1185
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:04,503
And then her mom left.

1186
01:09:05,703 --> 01:09:09,475
And ever since, Mads has been
spending her life trying to be seen,

1187
01:09:09,607 --> 01:09:10,809
but stay invisible
at the same time.

1188
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:12,777
She can't stay there anymore.

1189
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:17,349
Does that makes sense?

1190
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:23,089
Of course, it does.

1191
01:09:28,227 --> 01:09:30,795
Guess it's time
for us both to grow up.

1192
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:36,268
I don't... I don't
want to be rude, um...

1193
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:39,305
- I really have to lay down.
- Yeah.

1194
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:42,208
Uh, all the arguing,
the walking,

1195
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:45,444
it really makes
my pain levels go up.

1196
01:09:45,578 --> 01:09:47,679
- If you wouldn't mind to.
- Yeah.

1197
