1
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,793
Oh look, it opens up!

2
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:34,427
Hello Emily.

3
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:37,442
Hiiiii.

4
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:40,357
One day, when you are
old enough, you will be

5
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:43,099
impregnated with a perfect
clone of yourself.

6
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:47,763
You will later upload all of your
memories into this healthy new body.

7
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:53,409
One day long after that, you will
repeat this process all over again.

8
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:58,275
Through this cloning process, Emily,
you will hope to live forever.

9
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:02,858
I had lunch today!

10
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,434
I am a third generation Emily,

11
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,339
contacting you from 227
years into your future

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,478
and I would like you to know
that everything is going well

13
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:14,791
in the transfer and
cloning process,

14
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:18,414
with very few signs of
mentäl detariaration.

15
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:21,099
Is that Grandma?

16
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:27,678
No Emily, I am not your grandmother.
In a sense, you are mine. I am Emily.

17
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:28,935
Emily.

18
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:31,386
For those who cannot afford
the cloning process,

19
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:35,557
many of our elderly undergo a full
digital transfer of consciousness,

20
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:40,448
where they can experience a safe,
extended lifespan of hundreds of years.

21
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:44,810
Our grandfather's digital consciousness
currently resides in this cube,

22
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:49,206
where I upload the latest films and
books for him to enjoy every week.

23
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,529
Grandpa!

24
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:53,262
We are also able to download
correspondence from him.

25
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:57,317
Over 1,000 letters were received
during his first hour in storage,

26
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,534
as this was approximately 4
years time inside the cube.

27
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:03,053
I will read one of his
letters to you now.

28
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:09,113
“Oh. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Oh my God.

29
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:13,449
Holy mother of God.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh God.”

30
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,641
For end-of-life procedures for our less
affluent citizens in the lower classes,

31
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:22,390
the face of a deceased loved one
can be peeled off, preserved,

32
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,902
and stretched over the head of
a simple animatronic robot,

33
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:28,586
so they can still be a
part of someone's life.

34
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:38,247
Our view-screens allow us to
witness any event in history by

35
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:42,130
reordering the light impressions
recorded on the subatomic particles

36
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:47,845
that are in constant chaos all around us.
It is how i am watching you now, Emily.

37
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,262
It is how we watch everything in your time.
Our more recent history is

38
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:56,613
often just comprised of images of
other people watching view-screens.

39
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,987
Do you like my cars?

40
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:05,820
How I'm contacting you today though, Emily,
is through experimental time travel.

41
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:10,710
Time travel for physical beings is a much more
difficult process than sending a message.

42
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:15,316
If the position of the orbiting
earth is not accurately calculated,

43
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,566
a person can be sent
off the planet.

44
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:23,355
Many of our brave test clones are also still
regularly crushed beneath the ground,

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,921
Or accidentally deposited hundreds
of thousands of years into the past.

46
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:33,571
Time travel is very often unpredictable,
and still extremely dangerous.

47
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:38,027
Emily, I shall now use time travel to
bring you to my current location in time.

48
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:39,848
Wha?

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,110
Hey!

50
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,407
Butterflies!

51
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,391
Oh! I saw some pink ones!

52
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,665
The people of your time were engaged
with something called the Internet.

53
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,455
Welcome, Emily, to the Outernet.

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,217
We are now connected
through a neural network.

55
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,307
Green…

56
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:05,736
Blue...

57
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,096
Some lines are coming out.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,475
Yes, Emily Prime, to the people of your time,
our technology must seem like magic.

59
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,219
- Ooh!

60
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:29,750
And brown… And brown and green and blue
and green… That’s all the colors I got.

61
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:33,622
For all of its magic, the
Outernet can be a sad place.

62
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:38,622
Many lonely people from the lower classes
have disappeared into its safe infinity

63
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,466
to be never heard from again.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,774
Look!  I drawed…
a triangle!

65
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,320
I drew a snake boy.

66
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:54,211
But some days… you have
to not make a snake boy.

67
00:04:54,236 --> 00:05:02,309
Because yesterday I didn’t see
any snake boy… but you made one.

68
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,550
Yes.

69
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:08,156
Can I do your other…
Golden round things?

70
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,773
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

71
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:12,550
Wiggle wiggle wiggle!

72
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,612
OK.

73
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:17,071
I have many memories that I would
like to share with you now, Emily.

74
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:21,057
We can go visit them together,
like seeing pictures in a book.

75
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,850
Please follow me
into the window.

76
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:25,511
Circle!

77
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,738
When I was your age,

78
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:32,945
there was a controversial new
exhibit in the modern art museum.

79
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,996
An artist placed a clone on
display in a stasis tube.

80
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:42,027
A child without a brain that the public
could watch grow old in real time.

81
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:44,606
Can you smell the floor polish?

82
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:52,217
The museum’s antiseptic but musty odor
of countless generations in passing.

83
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,512
What was his name?

84
00:05:54,716 --> 00:06:00,049
Museum visitors nicknamed the body “David,”
and it became a popular attraction.

85
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,973
Regular visitors ate
lunch in his wing.

86
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:06,469
Classrooms of children came
to learn about anatomy.

87
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,873
People who'd speak quietly
to him in the night.

88
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:13,736
People who'd pay him a visit whenever
they found themselves back in the city

89
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,420
and remembered he was there.

90
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:18,244
It has a new one,  it says its old.

91
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:24,823
Yes. David grows older and older until
he dies at the age of seventy two.

92
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:28,353
He is quietly removed from
display without publicity,

93
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:31,510
as per the artist's
original instructions.

94
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:35,349
He is mourned and deeply
missed throughout the city.

95
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:38,257
I can still remember its eyes...

96
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:41,293
its blinking eyes.
- Eyeees.

97
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:45,089
There’s something
in my museum...

98
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:51,742
and there's... they don’t move...
And I hear somebody talking… a lot.

99
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:55,505
Yes. That is the memory
I just shared with you.

100
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,176
Because I have brought you inside of it, you
are now mistaking the memory for your own.

101
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:01,716
Okay.

102
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,892
We mustn’t linger. It is easy
to get lost in memories.

103
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:13,022
My first job was supervising robots on
the moon. Are you familiar with robots?

104
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:20,821
Yes, I always like robots. I have
a red robot and a pink robot.

105
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:25,490
I enjoyed working with them.
I enjoyed the solitude.

106
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,385
The robots are
solar powered, and

107
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,499
must always be kept on the light
side of the moon’s surface.

108
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:34,014
To motivate them to constantly
move within the drifting sunlight,

109
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,282
I programmed them to fear death and
what lies on the dark side of the moon.

110
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,243
It’s getting dark outside!

111
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:44,552
It was here, on the moon, that
I fell in love with a rock.

112
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:48,884
I did not understand my mental and
emotional shortcomings at the time

113
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,890
and only knew that I found this
rock to be immensely attractive.

114
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,375
It was sparkly.

115
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:58,474
The economy on the lunar surface
went through a recession

116
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:01,226
and I was sent home
after six cycles.

117
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,282
My rock and I were separated.

118
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,672
But the robots were too
expensive to remove.

119
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,011
To this day, they are in perpetual
movement across the sunlight.

120
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,655
Oh Look,
its a little moon!

121
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,253
With no work to do, no more tasks to accomplish,
still living in constant fear of death,

122
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,126
and occasionally sending
us depressed poetry.

123
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,803
I will read one of their
poems to you now, Emily.

124
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:32,159
"The light is the life. Robot must move.
Move, robot, move. But why?

125
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:36,901
Move, move, move. Robot.
Forever move."

126
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:41,964
I was relocated to supervise the
construction robots on the boundary

127
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,748
of the Keeowah, in deep space.

128
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,773
- Keeowah!

129
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:47,741
It was there that I fell
in love with a fuel pump.

130
00:08:47,766 --> 00:08:53,016
This part of my life continued to develop, and
it was much more satisfying than the rock.

131
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:57,879
In one of the tropical moon caves,
I found an abandoned nest of eggs.

132
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,356
It’s purple!

133
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,717
You open the lids like
that and it comes off.

134
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,642
What is that?
A monster.

135
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:16,452
That’s his mouth? No,
that’s his mouth.

136
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,985
Stop it you silly thing!

137
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:25,625
I named it Simon.

138
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,377
Simon!

139
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:31,719
Yes. Again you think you remember
because you are experiencing a memory

140
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,094
from my point of view.

141
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,371
Yeah.

142
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:39,140
Simon grew up and followed me around for
7 years, saying unintelligible things.

143
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:44,082
We fell in love.

144
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:48,256
For vacations, we sailed
in balloons on Mars.

145
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,302
- He’s flying!

146
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:57,028
But I missed my home.
I missed something deeper.

147
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,008
Did you miss me?

148
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:03,513
Yes.

149
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:08,447
At birth, I had inherited from you the
memory of myself meeting you right now.

150
00:10:08,763 --> 00:10:09,763
What?

151
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:14,919
I made a decision to be reassigned to
Earth and spend more time with people.

152
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,175
These became the happiest
years of my life.

153
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,865
But Simon was inconsolable.

154
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:34,038
For many years, memories could
only be harvested from the dead.

155
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:39,075
The images were fished out blindly from random
clusters of neurons and looked like this.

156
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:49,037
I opened an art gallery of anonymous memories,
and it was here that I met my husband.

157
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:54,248
He was a clone as well, from the same
source as David, the boy in the tube

158
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,628
I felt I had
known all my life.

159
00:10:56,653 --> 00:11:01,773
Only now his beautiful sparkly eyes
were lit with the mind of his Prime:

160
00:11:01,798 --> 00:11:04,039
a David from over 400 years ago.

161
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:08,695
As an older clone, he showed
many signs of deterioration.

162
00:11:09,858 --> 00:11:13,549
But I loved him, as
though we were originals.

163
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,307
He died suddenly, and David’s
line was permanently ended.

164
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,785
That is the thing about
the present, Emily Prime.

165
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:30,341
You only appreciate it
when it is the past.

166
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:35,176
I harvested his memories and
they still bring me happiness.

167
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:39,976
This is one my favorite of his
memories and I cannot explain why.

168
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:44,929
He is descending a staircase and sees
a large plant blowing in the wind.

169
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:48,519
Flopping its fronds together
in a sort of plant applause.

170
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,777
I have viewed this
memory over 6,000 times.

171
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:52,817
You missed him.

172
00:11:56,754 --> 00:12:01,337
I do not have the mental or emotional
capacity to deal with his loss.

173
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:08,125
But sometimes, I sit in a chair late
at night and quietly feel very bad.

174
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:13,145
When the night is at its most
quiet, I can hear death.

175
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:18,975
I am very proud of my sadness
because it means I am more alive.

176
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:23,200
I no longer fall in
love with rocks.

177
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:30,612
In 60 days from now, a
meteor will strike the Earth

178
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:33,396
and most everyone here
will die horribly.

179
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:38,736
Our wealthiest individuals are now uploading
their digital consciousnesses into cubes

180
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,826
that they are launching
into deep space.

181
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,080
Our lower classes are desperately
trying to escape the meteor

182
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:49,814
through discount time travel, causing
untold millions to die in orbit.

183
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:55,660
Their dead bodies burn as they return to
Earth and now light up our night sky.

184
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,984
What’s this up in the sky?

185
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,573
Dead bodies!

186
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,547
Look another one!

187
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,748
Yes.  It is very pretty.

188
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
They’re OK?

189
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,466
No.  They’re all dead.

190
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,185
I’ll count them!

191
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,079
One, Two, Three...
- [EMILY] We are all doomed, Emily Prime.

192
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:15,120
Even those on the
interplanetary ports.

193
00:13:15,145 --> 00:13:19,370
They are rumored to be burying the clones
of world leaders beneath the Earth.

194
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,345
Emily Prime, there is another
reason I have contacted you today.

195
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:29,139
You retain an early memory that I have
forgotten that was very important to me.

196
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:32,336
I wish to retrieve it
from you before I die.

197
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:35,118
I shall extract this
memory from you now.

198
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:44,312
This is... This is me…
And mommy.

199
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,911
This is me and mommy walking.

200
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,806
This is me and mommy walking.

201
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:56,038
A rainbow!

202
00:13:56,341 --> 00:14:00,281
Thank you, Emily. This will bring
me great comfort in the days ahead.

203
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,463
You missed it. I saw it.
You missed it.

204
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:10,269
This is your future, Emily Prime. It is
sometimes a sad life and it is a long life.

205
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:14,496
You will feel a deep longing for
something you cannot quite remember.

206
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,616
It will be a beautiful visit.

207
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:20,775
And then we shall share the same
fate as the rest of the human race:

208
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,490
dying horribly.

209
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,348
The advice is give you now is the
advice I remember receiving from myself

210
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:33,706
at your age in this moment, so I cannot be
certain where it actually originated from:

211
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:40,145
Do not lose time on daily trivialities.
Do not dwell on petty detail.

212
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:46,613
For all of these things melt away and drift
apart within the obscure traffic of time.

213
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:51,963
Live well and live broadly.
You are alive and living now.

214
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:54,453
Now is the envy of
all of the dead.

215
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,645
OK!

216
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,409
Thank you, Emily Prime.

217
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:04,063
It has been an honor to meet you and a joy to
emerge from your 3rd generation birth canal.

218
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:09,409
I shall now return you to your home and
current time. I will not contact you again.

219
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,565
Goodbye.

220
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,209
Aah!

221
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:46,201
What a happy day it is!

222
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,149
<i>Daffodil,
Daffodil,Daffodil</i>

223
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,921
<i>Oh look at these pretty colors!</i>

224
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,576
<i>I can see the sun is still there!</i>

225
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:19,244
<i>The rain's still there
and the rainbow's still there.</i>

226
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:22,496
<i>But the rain is still there,
and it didn't go away.</i>
