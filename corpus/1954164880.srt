And they've now begun

As you can see,

the high-density laser is
concentrated into plasma,

146
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,899
which energizes the wakefield,
controlling its emission.

147
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,235

was created by S.H.I.E.L.D.,

Leviathan pulled it off,

518
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,378

00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,495

the Leviathan soldiers.

We broke the code

We now have a lead.

543
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,932
And we need to
launch an Alpha strike
as soon as possible.

544
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:58,901
And we need to do it
before the bio-enhanced

is very powerful.

548
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,711
It can turn anyone
into a living weapon.

549
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:12,215
If that's the case,
we can't dispatch
the Avengers.

about the technology?

552
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,224
That they could
brainwash anyone?

553
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,193
We weren't absolutely
sure of that.

554
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:27,597
There's the possibility
that some past S.H.I.E.L.D.
projects

555
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,733
could have been compromised.
Some that couldn't
be implemented,

which were then canceled,
apparently fell into
the hands of Leviathan.

557
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,975
Among those projects
was one that centered on
mind-control research.

BLACK WIDOW:
That's why you
assigned me and Punisher,

for the same reason?

560
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,317
That's right.
Even if one or both of you
ended up getting brainwashed,

561
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,252

Never mind.
Among the long list

at least we know
where Leviathan
got our technology.

But there is one mystery...

578
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:43,840
FURY: Yes. How did he create
the bio-enhanced soldiers?

579
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,509
BLACK WIDOW:
<i>Elihas told me</i>
<i>he came up with a serum</i>

580
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,678
<i>that enhances</i>
<i>physical strength.</i>

581
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,546
That makes sense.
We know he stole

582
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:52,849
some classified data
before he supposedly died.

583
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,551
That's right.

584
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,787
Since he was dead,

585
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:00,289
we closed the case
and didn't bother
trying to follow up on it.

586
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,992
But in a later inventory,

587
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,661
we discovered he had taken
some very important
material with him.

588
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,766
And what would that have been?
