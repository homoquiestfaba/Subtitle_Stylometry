2
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,698
The border between
the United States and Mexico

3
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,908
spans 2,000 miles.

4
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,536
lt's also the most frequently
crossed land border

5
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,454
in the entire world.

6
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,624
And that just refers
to legal crossings.

7
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,836
Hundreds of thousands

8
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,339
try to cross into the U.S.
illegally every year.

9
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,884
Each person carries a story.

10
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,052
This is one of them.

11
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,014
l didn't know at the time
that this story

12
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,266
was also mine.

13
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,475
Vamonos.

14
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,123
Adentro.

15
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,110
Oh, l just sent it.
Did you get it?

16
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,571
Shouldn't you have a hot date
or something right now?

17
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,907
A hot story, even better.

18
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,202
That senator is a closet lefty
in a right-wing state,

19
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,204
and l am going to make damn sure
everybody knows it

20
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,748
before voting her in again.

21
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,418
Charlie...

22
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,086
can you proofread this for me?

23
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,214
There are plenty of folks

24
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,508
waiting to get into our country
the right way.

25
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,888
You like it?

26
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,181
l like it.

27
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,599
l think it deserves a special segment

28
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,059
on tomorrow night's broadcast.

29
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,978
Now l think you need to go home
and have a glass of wine.

30
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,064
There are a couple of facts
that need checked.

31
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,231
You don't have much time.

32
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,941
l want a quote from the other side.

33
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,195
- l'll get it done.
- No quote, no story.

34
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,239
- Okay.
- Fair and balanced, right?

35
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,116
l'm always fair.

36
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,035
Yeah, right.
Mm-hmm.

37
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,454
And kind of balanced.

38
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,835
What's your stance
on the vigilante situation?

39
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,301
Senator, do you support the expansion
of the border fence with Mexico?

40
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,304
Securing the border is a matter
of national security.

41
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,014
What about deploying
the National Guard?

42
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,684
We need more resources,
though, at our disposal.

43
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,938
Does that include local militants
and armed minutemen?

44
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,066
These are brave,
patriotic Americans

45
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,819
risking their lives
in the desert to protect us.

46
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,529
- So, Senator...
- Miss Talbert.

47
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,782
So you're in favor of the recent
Arizona immigration law?

48
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,575
Of course l am.

49
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:54,788
My record against
illegal immigration is clear.

50
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,374
Why, then, did you vote
in favor of a bill

51
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,418
four years ago supporting amnesty

52
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,337
for these same illegals
crossing into our country

53
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,922
every single day?

54
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,259
Miss Talbert, it's never
quite that simple.

55
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,928
Senator, l also have you on tape

56
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,139
supporting
a catch-and-release program.

57
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,559
But that, as l recall--

58
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,561
The very same program
which allowed a criminal

59
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,397
illegal alien who was
deported into Mexico

60
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,484
to cross back over our border
into Arizona one month later.

61
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,864
Thank you, Senator.

62
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,866
Senator,
how do you respond?

63
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,018
Come on.

64
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,277
- Aaron...
- Vamos adentro.

65
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,279
Aaron, can you hear me?

66
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,976
lt's Aaron.

67
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,770
Please leave me a message at the tone.

68
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,356
Damn.
What are you doing?

69
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,119
Where's the-- aw, come on.

70
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,428
- Bueno.
- Hola. Do you speak English?

71
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,764
Yes.

72
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,601
l'm looking for Aaron Talbert.

73
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,689
ls this Sharon Talbert?

74
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,363
Sharon Talbert...

75
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,407
was our mother.

76
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,492
She died two years ago.

77
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,496
This is Aaron's sister, Sofie Talbert.

78
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,624
Why are you looking for our mom?

79
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,501
l was trying to reach her

80
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,796
because she is the only contact
that we have here.

81
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,132
He missed his check-in tonight.

82
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,760
Any of our guys in the field
miss a check-in, we call contacts.

83
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,470
Just a safety precaution.

84
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,139
Have you heard from him?

85
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,354
Hello?

86
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,065
l tried calling him tonight, and...

87
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,029
when the phone answered,
l heard a gunshot.

88
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,156
A gunshot?

89
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,365
Let's do something.

90
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,368
Let's give it a few hours
before we get alarmed.

91
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,537
Just stay calm and call me back then

92
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,581
if you haven't heard from him, okay?

93
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,586
Asshole.

94
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,554
Okay.

95
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,765
l told you l cannot get ahold of him.

96
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,308
Look, you Americans,

97
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,520
you come down here
to get away from family.

98
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,773
Your brother, he needs money.

99
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,442
Write a check.

100
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,237
Put it on his table.

101
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,782
And if nobody cashes it in a week,

102
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,035
you come back and we talk
about him missing.

103
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,203
Hmm?

104
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,793
Taxi. Taxi.

105
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,462
Senor!

106
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,511
Aaron?

107
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,293
Roberto?

108
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Okay.

109
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,257
Excuse me.

110
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,010
- Hola.
- Roberto.

111
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,556
Okay.

112
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,646
Hasta luego.

113
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,648
- Si?
- l'm Sofie Talbert.

114
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,901
- Oh, yeah. You're Aaron's sister.
- Aaron's sister, yes.

115
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,528
- We spoke on the phone.
- Do you want a coffee?

116
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,364
l-- yeah.

117
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,412
The police don't really care
that Aaron's missing.

118
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,332
Technically your brother
isn't missing yet.

119
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,334
Yeah, have you spoken to him
since we talked on the phone?

120
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,627
Nope.

121
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,422
Anybody in here speak to him lately?

122
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,721
Well, he is missing, then.
All right?

123
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,807
l want to go out to the address

124
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,559
where he was last seen.

125
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,480
Look, it's too dangerous to go there.

126
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,899
Does anybody know
where Aaron Talbert was working?

127
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,734
l got it. l got it.

128
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,902
- You got it?
- Come with me.

129
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,779
Yeah. Follow me.

130
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,447
Thank you.

131
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,386
First time in Mexico?

132
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,641
You're not as talkative
as your brother, huh?

133
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,435
So what's your story?

134
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,938
You want to save the world,
like your brother?

135
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,606
What is it with you?

136
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,609
You provide relief to illegals,
breaking American laws.

137
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,944
l'm very proud of that.

138
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,868
My mom almost died
trying to cross to the US,

139
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,536
but somebody helped her, you know?

140
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,912
So that's what l do.

141
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,622
l help people.

142
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,790
What about you?

143
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,459
You have a husband?
You have kids?

144
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,170
Not that l know of.

145
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,635
No, l've been busy.

146
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,637
What about your family?

147
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,769
Dad died when we were little,

148
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,314
so my mom had to work

149
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,149
and l took care of Aaron.

150
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,677
- This is it.
- What?

151
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,056
This is where Aaron was last seen.

152
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,643
Do you want to check her out?

153
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,478
Yeah.

154
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,057
You shouldn't go that way.

155
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,642
Why not?

156
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,001
Jesus Christ.

157
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,838
- Shit!
- Come on!

158
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,090
You okay?

159
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,969
Look what l found.

160
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,889
That's Aaron's hat.

161
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,975
- lt's got blood on it.
- That's blood.

162
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,021
Don't shoot!

163
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,321
We're fine.

164
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,573
They just want to scare you.

165
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,451
Come on. Come on.

166
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,162
We're fine.
Don't shoot!

167
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,859
Buenas.

168
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:35,363
Hola.
Do you speak English?

169
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,031
Who's this?

170
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,034
Do you know Aaron Talbert?

171
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,412
Not if l don't know who this is.

172
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,165
This is his sister.

173
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,459
l can't find him, and...

174
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,379
l'm trying to see if you
might know where he is.

175
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,048
Not over the phone.

176
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,633
Come to Altar tonight.

177
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,636
Come alone.
l'll find you.

178
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,221
l--

179
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,640
Hell-- hello?

180
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,058
Hello?

181
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,775
Tell me about Altar.

182
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,487
- Altar?
- Yeah.

183
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,905
lt's a small town

184
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,242
full of migrants, thieves, and coyotes.

185
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,910
How do l get there?

186
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,120
You don't want to get there

187
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,456
unless you want to sneak
across the border or get killed.

188
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,126
Look, you can either tell me
how to get there

189
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,586
or l'm going to figure it out myself,

190
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,337
but l need to get there tonight.

191
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,505
Why do you wanna go there?

192
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,008
l talked to this guy on the phone

193
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,761
and he knows Aaron,
and l need to meet him there.

194
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,598
lt's too dangerous, believe me.

195
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,935
Look, if there's any possibility
that l could find Aaron,

196
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,313
l need to go there now.

197
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,066
l want to be in Altar tonight,

198
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,862
so you can either take me to Altar

199
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,406
or l'll find someone else to take me.

200
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,105
Aaron, where are my migrants?

201
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,107
They're in Mexico,

202
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,567
they're in America, or they're dead.

203
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,760
So if he's out there

204
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,887
and if something's happened to him...

205
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,599
how long do we have to find him?

206
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,310
Somebody doesn't check in,

207
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,271
we only have 48 hours to find him.

208
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,416
Come on.

209
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,628
Why are we stopping?

210
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,423
Why? Because l'm hungry.
Come on.

211
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,605
So you're
drunk already? Okay.

212
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,275
No more soft drinks,

213
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,361
'cause when in Rome...

214
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,528
l drink wine.

215
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,821
Yeah, and we're not in Rome,

216
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,949
so we're going to drink tequila
'cause we're in Mexico.

217
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,451
And in Mexico we drink tequila.

218
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,119
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

219
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,413
To finding Aaron.

220
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,290
Okay.

221
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,304
l want you to give me
a good story about Aaron, okay,

222
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,308
a story l can blackmail him with
when we find him,

223
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,769
'cause we're going to find him, okay?

224
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,854
'Cause there's something
about Aaron that--

225
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,440
he always paint himself as an angel,

226
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,735
and l don't buy that, though, you know?

227
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,113
He's an angel.

228
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,657
Okay, so tell me a good story.

229
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,785
- Come on, shoot me one.
- Okay.

230
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,331
The first time

231
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,000
that Aaron offered relief

232
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,586
to border crossers...

233
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,924
was to tadpoles.

234
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,468
Come on. What?

235
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,636
Tadpoles.

236
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,179
What do you mean?
No, no.

237
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,473
Just tell me
the complete story, please.

238
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,812
Okay, we were little kids
and it was a really bad rainstorm.

239
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,815
And the next day l come downstairs

240
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,192
and there's Aaron,

241
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,070
and he's--

242
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,573
he's--

243
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,659
he's just scooping up
all these tadpoles

244
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,120
and putting them back in this ditch.

245
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,082
One by one.

246
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,254
Okay, officially he's an angel.

247
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,717
But there's something that,

248
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,385
l mean, l don't understand.

249
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,138
lf you two were that close,

250
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,766
why didn't you ever
come to visit him here?

251
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,941
l guess we just...

252
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,446
got busy.

253
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,325
You know?

254
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,160
Okay, come on.
Let's dance.

255
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,163
- Oh.
- What?

256
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,313
Come on.

257
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,610
Hey!

258
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,154
Hey, what the...?

259
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,281
- Hey! Hey!
- My bag!

260
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,075
Hey!

261
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,911
Oh, shit.

262
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,167
Are you okay?

263
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,377
Yeah, l'm okay.

264
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,253
Here's what we're going to do.

265
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,464
We're going to find a motel
to spend the night,

266
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,926
and tomorrow we'll figure out
what to do, okay?

267
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,094
- No.
- Let's go.

268
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,721
No, l need to go to Altar
and find my brother.

269
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,683
Let's go. Take me.
Take-- we got to go now.

270
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,934
Let's go.

271
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,388
El Dia de Los Muertos.

272
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,974
This is the Day of the Dead.

273
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,393
lt's a huge celebration here in Mexico.

274
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,149
Gracias.

275
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,568
Poor kid.
He'll never make it.

276
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,321
- He's going to cross?
- Of course.

277
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,241
Everybody here is trying
to cross the border.

278
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,160
Well, coyotes doesn't like kids.

279
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,662
lt's too much risk, you know?

280
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,247
Unless they're young girls.

281
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,833
They're worth a lot of money
around here.

282
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,920
So, where exactly did he say he'd be?

283
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,506
Well, he didn't say, exactly.

284
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,259
Okay.

285
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,430
There's a lot of people,
so let's do this.

286
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,681
l'm going to the mission.

287
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,016
lt is around the corner.

288
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,934
l'm going to check if somebody
has seen Aaron.

289
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,144
- Okay.
- You stay here.

290
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,189
l'll be right back, okay?
Don't go anywhere.

291
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,458
No, thanks.

292
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,174
Where did you get this?

293
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,760
Who gave this to you?

294
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,720
Who gave you this?

295
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,096
Hey! Kid!

296
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,848
Hey! Hey, wait! Hey!

297
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,225
Kid!

298
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,478
Kid! Kid!

299
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,646
Where you going?

300
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,105
- Huh, huh?
- No!

301
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,025
What are you doing?

302
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,862
Get off me.

303
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,365
Hey!

304
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,825
Hey.

305
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,997
My-- my friend is coming
and he'll be here any second.

306
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,041
Just take what you want
and leave me alone, okay?

307
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:40,295
What is this?
l-- l--

308
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,841
l told you not to bring anyone.

309
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,009
What?

310
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,264
You're stubborn like your brother.

311
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,065
All right.

312
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,652
How do l know l can trust you?

313
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,574
- Look.
- Okay.

314
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,536
How do you know Aaron?

315
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,955
We work together.

316
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,665
You're a relief worker?

317
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,334
Not exactly.

318
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,754
We help each other
match migrants with coyotes.

319
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,966
So that's what you and Aaron do?

320
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,679
You take migrants
over the border illegally?

321
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,056
You judge him plenty.
You don't need to judge me, too.

322
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,475
Look, one thing l know about Aaron

323
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,144
is he doesn't do anything illegally.

324
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,353
Well, if there's one thing
l know about you,

325
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,480
it's that you don't know
your brother very well.

326
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,569
Do you have any idea
where my brother is, really?

327
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,989
He was helping a group
of migrants a couple of nights ago

328
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:53,035
with new coyotes,
people he hadn't used before.

329
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,953
l haven't been able to reach him since.

330
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,371
Okay.

331
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,707
So we're going to go
talk to these coyotes

332
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,168
- and find out--
- Coyotes don't talk.

333
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,378
l'm going to do the run
l have scheduled with them

334
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,464
and see if l find Aaron.

335
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,841
Okay, so l'm going to go with you.

336
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,510
White girls don't do runs.

337
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,930
So what the hell did you
even meet with me for?

338
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:19,019
Look, if you're going
to go look for my brother,

339
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,979
then l'm going to go with you, too.

340
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,077
lf anyone asks,

341
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,037
you're a relief worker.

342
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,041
Don't ask questions
and don't start conversations.

343
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,043
Follow my lead.

344
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,628
lf l say, "Move," you move fast.

345
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,171
Okay.

346
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,174
lf they think you're scared,
you got a target on your back.

347
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,051
Just so you know,

348
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,886
if they find you...

349
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,597
you die.

350
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,815
Right now, you're dead.

351
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,767
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

352
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,145
No one else knows
about this, all right?

353
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,022
- All right.
- Let's go.

354
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,751
There's a lot of money to be made.

355
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,045
Come on, let's go.

356
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,275
Documentos.

357
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,235
- Stay quiet.
- Documentos.

358
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,112
You'll be all right.

359
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,781
They won't mess with you.

360
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,786
He's from El Salvador.
He's illegal in our country.

361
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,413
You got to cross two borders
to get to be illegal in yours.

362
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,916
They'll take what they want
out of him and let him cross.

363
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,424
Hey! Hey!

364
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,592
Stay out of it.

365
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,177
- Leave him alone!
- You'll make it worse.

366
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,345
What the hell?

367
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,226
Don't touch me.

368
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,394
l don't pay to get into my own country.

369
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,899
Hey, hey.

370
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,600
Hey.

371
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,147
Your politics may be closer
to your brother's

372
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,982
than you want to admit.

373
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,233
Hey.

374
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,742
Let's go.

375
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,091
Hey, gringa, come here!

376
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,759
Come on.

377
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,473
All right, get in there.

378
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,100
Are you kidding me?

379
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,894
You want to find your brother?

380
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,771
lt's the only way l know how.

381
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,440
Come on.

382
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,942
Scoot in there.

383
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,695
- Okay.
- Come on.

384
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,363
Come on.

385
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,681
Juanita.

386
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,378
Hey.

387
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,735
Hey, enough.

388
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,070
Sounds like a hospital in here.

389
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,864
Suck on your inhaler, man.

390
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,867
Leave him alone.

391
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,329
You're stressing him out.
You're making it worse.

392
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,872
l'm sorry.

393
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,000
You speak English?

394
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,922
Yeah. My boss promotes me
if l can speak to the customers.

395
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,760
lf you've got a job in America,

396
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,345
why didn't you just stay there?

397
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,515
l have to get back to El Salvador

398
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,475
to see my baby born.

399
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,314
How old are you?

400
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,068
l'm 23.

401
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,184
Why are we stopping?

402
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,478
Why aren't we crossing the border?

403
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,063
We're picking up a stash first.

404
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,785
Aaron would never have been
involved in shit like this.

405
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,579
Well, he's not the same naive guy

406
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,998
that walked into the desert
five years ago.

407
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,583
He helps people.

408
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,668
But in order to do that,
sometimes we all need

409
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,878
to look the other way.

410
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,662
Gaspar! Luis!

411
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,961
Hey, vayanse.
Let's go.

412
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,173
Hey, no matter what happens,

413
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,424
you stay hidden.

414
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,842
You understand?

415
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,177
Just stay here.

416
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,054
Whenever it's safe,
l'll come and get you.

417
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,555
Stay.

418
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,349
Let's go.
Vamonos.

419
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,517
Hey.

420
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,656
Stay here.
Don't move.

421
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,449
Stay.

422
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,032
You want a free ride, bitch?

423
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,575
No.

424
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,036
Yes.

425
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,455
There are no free rides here.

426
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,792
- Everybody pays.
- Okay.

427
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,388
Get out.

428
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,437
- Get out!
-  Okay.

429
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,067
Okay.

430
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,512
l can pay. l have money.
l can pay you!

431
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,394
You hide a gringa in my truck, huh?

432
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,738
Listen.

433
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,992
Your passport is worth nothing here...

434
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,805
Move.

435
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,907
Hola.

436
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,274
No. No.

437
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,790
Javier...

438
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,180
Aren't you a little young
to be traveling by yourself?

439
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,475
These coyotes will get plenty
of money for her on the street.

440
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,438
Somebody put her right
on the birth control pill,

441
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,190
so if she gets raped,

442
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,567
it won't be so bad.

443
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,655
Can you help her?

444
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,587
ls she okay?

445
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,241
Feel it.

446
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,867
Come, feel it.

447
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,006
How far along are you?

448
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,549
Seven months.

449
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,137
This American baby will save us.

450
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,139
Why?

451
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,851
Because our baby
is going to be American.

452
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,252
No.

453
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,142
- Hey.
- They know who she is, okay?

454
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,102
- They know she's my sister.
- l gotta get you out of here.

455
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,353
You understand?
You gotta get her out of here.

456
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,355
- l gotta get you out of here.
- You're not gonna be able to.

457
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,107
- There's not enough time.
- Come on.

458
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,609
Listen to me, God damn it.
Sit down.

459
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,320
Come here.

460
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,487
They're not gonna kill me, all right?

461
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,655
They're not gonna kill me

462
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:27,823
as long as they don't know
where the migrants are,

463
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,491
but they will kill Sofie.

464
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,410
- So please--
- She won't leave without you.

465
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,329
Tell her you didn't find me.
You understand?

466
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,080
You did not find me.

467
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:39,293
- The talk is they're going to kill--
- Don't make me watch her die.

468
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,003
l don't want to sit here
and watch them kill her.

469
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,797
Now, will you just please get her home?

470
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,425
Go. Just go.

471
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,802
Just go.
For the love of God, go.

472
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,141
- Okay.
- Go.

473
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,916
No.

474
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,055
No, no.

475
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,683
No.

476
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,988
No. No.

477
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,656
lt's okay. lt's okay.

478
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,373
You all right?

479
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,170
- Let's go.
- Where's Aaron?

480
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,630
- Where's Aaron?
- Let's go.

481
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,048
We got to get out of here.

482
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,217
We got to get out of here
right now. Come on.

483
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,094
- What about everybody else?
- They'll be all right.

484
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,554
Don't worry about them.

485
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,180
Yeah, come on,
we got to get out of here.

486
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,601
Let's go.

487
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,245
Are you okay?

488
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,997
l don't want to talk about it.

489
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,862
So is this how you met Aaron,

490
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,031
taking people across the border?

491
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,700
No.

492
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,452
No, l was--

493
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,039
l was up north working as a line cook.

494
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,375
Finally made enough money
to hook up my wife

495
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,920
with a coyote l thought l could trust.

496
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,465
She never showed up.

497
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,928
He just--

498
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,392
he just left them there
alone in the desert.

499
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,935
What?

500
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,772
My wife Anna--

501
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,651
Anna didn't make it.

502
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,945
Your brother was the one
that found them.

503
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,364
They were...

504
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,791
Yeah.

505
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,627
But Lucia...

506
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,465
Your brother--

507
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,176
your brother saved my daughter.

508
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,982
Where is she now?

509
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,110
She--

510
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,987
she lives with my sister

511
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,824
in a little town in Mexico, in Puebla.

512
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,787
But one day,

513
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,872
l'm going to bring her to America.

514
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,918
l'm going to give her an education,

515
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,753
a chance,

516
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,674
so she won't be just another kid
selling Chiclets on the streets.

517
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,015
Look.

518
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,310
She's beautiful.

519
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,357
She has her mother's eyes.

520
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,236
She's got your smile.

521
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

522
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,329
Do you-- do you have any kids?

523
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,331
Me? No.

524
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,543
Nah, l--

525
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,379
l just never--

526
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,892
l never had the time.

527
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,524
You should.

528
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,153
You should make the time.

529
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,469
Rico!

530
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,310
Don't!

531
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,586
Okay, let's go.

532
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,236

533
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,696
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

534
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,699
Come on! Come on.

535
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,452
- Okay.
- Come on!

536
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,621
Follow me.

01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,250
Come here. Come on.
Come. Come here. Come. Come.

538
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,549
Run!

539
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,678
We're going to make it.
Let's go.

540
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,640
Come this way.

541
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,769
Follow me.
Come on, hurry!

542
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,619
Okay. Let's go.

543
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,028
Yeah.

544
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,197
Move. Come on.
Move fast.

545
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,824
Come on, let's go.

01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,874
Let's go. Let's go.

547
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,682
Move. Move!

548
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,100

549
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,977
Come on.

550
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:25,058
Keep going!

551
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,202
Hey, how's it going?

552
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,788
- Yeah.
- Move along. Come on.

553
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,790
Move forward.

554
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,168
You gotta to open up the trunk, please.

555
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,463
Hi there. Can l see
your passport, please?

556
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:39,150
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

557
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:06,261
Shh, shh.

558
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:25,280
Forward, please.

559
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,407
Drive on. Just drive on.
Keep it going. Keep it going.

560
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,242
Pull forward.
Pull forward, please.

561
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,411
Pull forward. Okay.

562
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,269
No.

563
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,222
Hey! Hey!

564
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,057
- Stop the truck! Stop the truck!
- Stop that truck!

565
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:54,892
Hey, stop the truck!
Let me see your hands!

566
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,185
- Put your hands up!
- Put your hands in the air!

567
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,353
Let me see your hands!

568
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:59,188
- Get out of the truck.
- Put your hands in the air!

569
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:01,274
No!

570
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:05,611
No.

571
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,449
No. No.

572
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,306
Oh, my God.

573
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,683
Come on. Come on.
Get up.

574
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,188
- U.S. Border Patrol!
- Put your hands up!

575
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,776
Wait. No. No.

576
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:45,985
Drop the gun!

577
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,446
Hands over your head!

578
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,615
- Drop the gun!
- No! No! No!

579
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,785
No, no, no, no! No, no.
No, no. No.

580
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,746
- No. No. No.
- Step away.

581
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,499
- Step away.
- Javier. Javier.

582
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,543
Lucia. Lucia.

583
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,921
- Lucia.
- We'll get her. We'll get her.

584
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,968
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

585
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,396
What did you do?!
What did you do?!

586
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,189
- You're under arrest.
- What did you do?

587
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,442
- Put your hands behind your back.
- You are under arrest.

588
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:29,612
Ma'am, you're under arrest.
Put your hands behind your back.

589
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,905
Javier.

590
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:39,872
What did you do?

591
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,421
l'm sorry.

592
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:52,176
No. No!

593
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:54,470
No!

594
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,391
No, no, no.

595
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:15,700
Maria! No!

596
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,868
No!

597
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,079
No! Maria!

598
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,289
No!

599
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,917
No! No!

600
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:28,921
Maria!

601
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,031
No!

602
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:10,087
Miss Talbert, now tell me again.

603
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,882
What is the reason
you were in the desert

604
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,926
so close to the Mexican border?

605
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:17,220
Sightseeing.

606
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,603
Look...

607
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:32,068
you can't charge me
for being in the Arizona desert.

608
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,323
l'm an American citizen.

609
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,077
l'm a TV reporter.

610
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:44,997
l know my rights.

611
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,503
Javier Guerrero--

612
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,089
he was not an American citizen, was he?

613
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,760
Miss Talbert,

614
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:01,264
was he or was he not an illegal alien?

615
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,516
lt's not that simple.

616
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,726
l'm afraid it is that simple.

617
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,687
Our laws make it that simple.

618
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:09,855
Have you ever gone
a minute down the road

619
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:11,357
and taken a look at what's going on?

620
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,692
Have you ever walked out the door

621
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:15,194
and gone over the border
and looked at what's happening?

622
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,446
Because l have.

623
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:19,991
They're innocent people over there.

624
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:22,159
Have you seen the suffering
that they're enduring

625
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,536
to have what we have,

626
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,455
what we just take for granted
every single day?

627
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,082
You don't have to raise
your voice, Miss Talbert.

628
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,710
l think there is a reason
for me to raise my voice!

629
01:16:30,877 --> 01:16:32,420
People are dying!

630
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,925
All right, look, let's start
from the beginning.

631
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,553
How exactly did you meet this coyote?

632
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:42,930
Did you hear me?!

633
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:53,816
You don't have to get emotional, ma'am.

634
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,193
God damn it.

635
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,197
Okay, look,

636
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:03,784
l can't charge you with breaking
any of our laws.

637
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,662
And l'm sorry for your suffering,

638
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,458
but we have rules and regulations

639
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,669
for immigrants to come
into this country legally.

640
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,921
lf you don't agree
with our immigration laws,

641
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,842
then, well, l suggest
you contact your senator.

642
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,761
Sign.

643
01:17:58,298 --> 01:17:59,882
Luz.

644
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,807
Rafael.

645
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,144
Rafael. Rafael.

646
01:18:12,312 --> 01:18:14,188
Where's Maria?

647
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,731
Where is she?

648
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,942
No, what?

649
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,152
Where is she?

650
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,154
No.

651
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:23,698
- Let's move.
- No.

652
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,283
- Come on.
- No.

653
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:27,952
Let's go.

654
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,347
Hey.

655
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,995
l'm just--

656
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,789
l'm so sorry.

657
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,060
l'm...

658
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,034
Come on.

659
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:09,678
You okay?

660
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,184
Here.

661
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,159
No.

662
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:30,843
You.

663
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:49,612
Walk.

664
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:08,964
- Aaron!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

665
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,633
- Sof, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
- Aaron!

666
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,384
Aaron!

667
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:14,595
- Aaron.
- You sit down, bitch.

668
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,056
No! Aaron!

669
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,641
Aaron, are you okay?

670
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,601
No, don't you fucking touch her!

671
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,107
Do something for this bitch.

672
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,319
l don't want the drugs
to burst inside of her.

673
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,239
And especially l don't want to
dig them out of her dead body.

674
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:56,303
- You filled me with drugs?
- What?!

675
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,138
- You son of a bitch!
- Shut the fuck up!

676
01:22:58,306 --> 01:22:59,431
God damn you.

677
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,267
You filled everyone with drugs.

678
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,271
Yes, l fill you with drugs.

679
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:09,525
And if you're not careful,

680
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:13,362
you're going to end up
like that woman and her baby.

681
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,866
That stupid baby

682
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:19,952
kept kicking and kicking,

683
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:23,789
and it smashed all the drugs
inside of her stomach.

684
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,002
Killed them both.

685
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,672
Why?

686
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:40,472
Because the dogs can't smell the drugs

687
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,307
when they're inside of you.

688
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:48,522
Besides, the best drug mule

689
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,233
is the mule that doesn't know
that she is a mule.

690
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:56,989
As you can attest, of course.

691
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,192
l--

692
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,402
l have to go to the bathroom.

693
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:10,604
They're here.

694
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,775
l'm going to tell them that
we're going to get the stash back,

695
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,569
so you better keep an eye
on these two, okay?

696
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,107
Let's move.

697
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:41,361
Oh, my God.
Oh, my--

698
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,529
Got it.

699
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,323
- Go. We got to move.
- Come on, come on.

700
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:47,659
Get the gun. Get the gun.

701
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:48,827
Come on.

702
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,873
Hey.

703
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,045
- Oh!
- Come on, come on.

704
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,339
Come on. Come on.

705
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,014
Juanita.

706
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,130
Drop the gun.
Drop it.

707
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,388
We got runners, southeast of the ranch.

708
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:56,895
- l can't.
- Come on. Come on.

709
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,105
Come on!

710
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,232
God damn it, come on.

711
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,282
Come on. This way.
Come on.

712
01:28:09,742 --> 01:28:11,410
Come on.
lt's okay.

713
01:28:11,577 --> 01:28:12,953
No, no, come on.

714
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,329
lt's okay.

715
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,088
No. No, no.

716
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,595
No, no.

717
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,308
No. Come on.

718
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:41,440
- lt's breaking.
- Oh, my God.

719
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:43,942
Hold on. Hold on!

720
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,278
No, stay-- stay with me.

721
01:28:48,364 --> 01:28:49,573
l'm here.
l'm here, honey.

722
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,908
l got you.
My God, no.

723
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,704
Breathe!
For God's sake, breathe!

724
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:56,872
Oh, my God!

725
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,586
Come on.

726
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:05,756
Jesus Christ!

727
01:29:38,664 --> 01:29:40,165
You know you can't tell her.

728
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:42,834
