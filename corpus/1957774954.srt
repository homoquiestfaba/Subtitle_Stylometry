00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:02,362
You wanna keep him?

6
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,432
What if he's lost?

7
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:19,413

a very happy birthday.</i>

<i>I know it's been a minute.</i>

14
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:45,472
<i>Saw that you and your mom
went on vacation.</i>

15
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,407
(chuckles) <i>That looked nice.</i>

16
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:50,078

00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,118
<i>The... the bombs
were totally fake.</i>

21
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,454

Love you.</i>

Not sure what your mom told you</i>

25
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,838
<i>about what happened, but if you
give me a call I can explain</i>

26

27
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,841

I had to reschedule.</i>

be able to make it</i>

<i>Your mom and I, haven't been
in a good spot lately</i>

next time I see you.</i>

40

please forgive me,</i>

44

Just look the other way, okay?</i>

45

<i>Hey, Franklin,</i>

49
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,348
<i>I didn't like the way
our last call went.</i>

50
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,217
<i>I said some stuff
I shouldn't have said,</i>

51
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,687
<i>and maybe you did too,</i>

52
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,523
<i>and, I don't know,
I'm sorry about it.</i>

53
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,323
<i>Father-son stuff
is tricky sometimes.</i>

54

<i>- Anyway, love you.</i>
- (tense music fades)

55
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,947
Dude: Being here
for the past few weeks

56
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,198
has made me realize
suicide was never the answer.

57
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:21,602
So, thank you all
for helping me through this.

58
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,507
(applause)

59
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,776
Does, uh, anyone else
have anything

60
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,244
they wanna say
before we say our goodbyes?

61
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:34,414
Franklin?

62
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,718
Would you like to share?

63
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,654
Oh, uh, no. No, thanks.

64
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,322
Ooh, you sure?
It's the last day.

65
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,892
(perky music playing)

66
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:50,565
I, uh, took some steps
in setting healthy boundaries

67
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:54,301
and, uh, blocked my dad online.

68
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,308
<i>He lies and makes excuses.</i>

69
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,045
<i>He's never really
been there for me</i>

70
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,615
<i>when I needed him,
and I... I'm done with that.</i>

(Chuck sighs)

72
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,804
Franklin: <i>I don't need that
in my life right now.</i>

73

(applause)

74
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,395
- Thank you.
- Group Leader: That's great.

75
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,392
Uh. Anyone else?

76

Diane: Thanks again.

79
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,277
How was that, uh,
closing ceremony thing?

80
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:40,313
- I love myself now.
- (chuckles)

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,825
But it wasn't
as bad as you thought

82
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,752
- it was gonna be, right?
- Hmm, yeah.

83
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,890
All right.

84
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,726
(indistinct)

85
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,062
Can I try driving?

86
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,899
Now? No,
you don't have a license.

87
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,501
I know, but can I just try
for just one... just one part?

88
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:02,603
Diane:
In a crowded parking lot? No.

89
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,005
- Right.
- Diane: No.

90
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,407

<i>Uh...</i>

98
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,422
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

<i>Uh, I'm not here right now,
but leave a message</i>

103

<i>and I'll get back to you.
Thank you.</i>

(phone beeps)

105
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,507
Chuck: (over phone)
<i>Hey, it's your dad. Um...</i>

106
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,475
<i>Hey, did you delete
your profile?</i>

107
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,478
Because it was kind of the...
kind of the main way

108
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,114
I was staying in touch with you.

109
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:21,549
(door hinges squeak)

110
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,452
Chuck: <i>I know it's not perfect,
but it's something.</i>

111
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,090
<i>So, uh, let me know.</i>

112
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,260
<i>And, um... I...</i>

113
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,964
<i>and I love you,
and I'll talk to you soon.</i>

114
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,398
I love you. Bye.

115
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:54,649
- Jimmy: You all right, Chuck?
- Hey.

116
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,518
Jimmy: No, seriously.
What's up, man?

117
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,222
- What's up with what?
- You look sad as fuck.

118
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,025
(chuckles) No, I don't. No.

119
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,425
Nah... I'm pretty sure

120
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,239
this is what a sad
motherfucker looks like.

121
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,699
My, uh... (sniffles) ...son.
I've been trying to...

122
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,377
trying to get in touch
with my son and...

123
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,636
and he's been ignoring me.

124
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,470
Ignoring you?

125
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:21,909
And I think... I think...
I think he blocked me online.

126
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,045
Okay.

127
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,925
I mean, it happens. You know,
my ex blocked me one time

128
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,885
and I just started a different
page under a different name,

129
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,587
a whole different picture.
(chuckling) You know.

130
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,032
I was checking her shit
all the time.

131
00:07:35,056 --> 00:07:36,891
She never even knew.
(chuckles)

132
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,693
Maybe you should
come to karaoke tonight.

133
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,863
You know, it'll make you
feel better, man.

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,832
Come sing with us
and have some fun.

135
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:47,101
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jimmy: Yeah...

136
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:50,738
(chuckles, clears throat)

137
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,173

Real Becca: Can I help you
with something?

143

Can I help you with something?

144
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,033
Uh...

145
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,701
- You okay?
- I'm great.

146
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,538
Uh, see here.
I'll probably get some coffee.

147
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,508
(sniffles)

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,308
Talkin' to people
is a good start.

149
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,310
(whispers) Yeah.

150
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,914
Let me get you something.
See if we turn things around.

151
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,149
Okay.

152
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,251
- I'm Becca.
- I'm Chuck.

153
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,585

this was my idea?

your ex and the account
you made.

masturbating to this?

you started talking to me first?

The same dog?

244
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,790
- (chuckles) The same kind.
- Oh.

245
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,393
And I thought you looked nice.

246
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,467
Well...
this is definitely a first.

- how's it goin'?
- Good.

251
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:31,118
Actually, I was just about to
jump off my mom's roof.

253
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,458
Just kidding.

254
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,528

256
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:47,668

257
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,804

352
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:11,692
- Oh my God.
- (shushes)

353
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:13,995
No. No, no, no. (shushes)

354
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,898
(song continues playing)

355
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:22,603
Franklin: Okay, so...

356
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:24,572
You pretty much
just have to keep going,

357
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,307
and that's that whole game.

358
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,675
Becca: Can I try?

359
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:29,186
- Franklin: If you want.
- Becca: Just keep going?

360
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,490
Franklin: Yeah, just keep goin'.

361
00:23:31,112 --> 00:23:32,747
(both chuckle)

362
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,850
(song continues playing)

363
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:39,287
(flashes)

364
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:43,124
(loud bang)

365
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:06,547
(song fades)

366
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:11,185
(birds chirping)

367
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,032
(message tone)

368
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,835
Becca: You are really good
at that game.

369
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,249
You were getting
pretty good too.

370
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,238
I saw on your page
you won an award for it?

371
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,641
Yeah, it's kinda stupid, though.

372
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,576
- Why is it stupid?
- Franklin: I don't know.

373
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,645
I guess I've always
wanted to be like...

374
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,748
a video game coder.

375
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,818
(gasps) Okay. You should
apply to some places

376
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,386
for like an internship
or something.

377
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,822
- (chuckles)
- What's funny?

378
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,524
I didn't know what else to say,
so I just typed "Haha."

379
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,095
Ha ha ha.

380
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,964
Ha ha ha.

381
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,033
Ha ha ha ha ha.

382
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,103
Ha ha ha ha ha.

383
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:04,438
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

384
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:07,508
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

385
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,210
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

386
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,212
Both: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

387
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,347
(keypad clacking)

388
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:14,749
Diane: What?

389
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:19,787
I, uh... I met someone.

390
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:22,757
Online.

391
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:28,029
Oh. Really?
Um, what's her name?

392
00:25:28,662 --> 00:25:32,133
- Becca. Thompson.
- Hmm.

393
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,006
I don't know.
There's something about her.

394
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:38,305
She's like... really smart.

395
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,041
<i>Funny.</i>

396
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,145
I don't know. She's just like...

397
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:47,381
<i>cool.</i>

398
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:50,195
And you've like talked to her
on the phone and stuff?

399
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,455
- Obviously.
- (Diane chuckles)

400
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:59,293
Cool. That's really...
it's exciting news. (chuckles)

401
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:03,431
Wow, online. Like through
friends or just random?

402
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,566
(soft tense music playing)

403
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:10,938
(keyboard clacking)

404
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,704
(indistinct chatter)

405
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:54,715
So. I... I told some
of my tech friends about you.

406
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,319
- (shivers)
- Seriously?

407
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,689
I hope you don't mind.

408
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:04,158
- No, no. That's... thank you.
- (chuckles)

409
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,860
That's awesome.

410
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,031
What's up?

411
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,869
Do you wanna video chat?

412
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:17,972
- N... Now?
- Sure.

413
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,407
(chuckling)
I'm kind of camera-shy.

414
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,709
I am, too.

415
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,236
Well, what if
we just keep to this?

416
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:25,045
What if you're
some old guy or something?

417
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,982
(laughs)

418
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,120
Chuck. This is incest.

419
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:36,023
No, Jimmy, it's not.
I'm doing this to help him.

420
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:37,758
He thinks
he's in a relationship.

421
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,827
Yeah, we talk
about life and stuff.

422
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,560
It's not like
I'm trying to see his dick.

423
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:42,863
Oh, come on now.

424
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,908
I don't want to hear nothin'
about your boy's dick.

425
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,009
That's your son's dick
you're talkin' about.

426
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,401
I said I'm not trying to.

427
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,404
If I stop now, it'll crush him.

428
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:53,073
I need to see it through.

429
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,210
Camera's broke.

430
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,649
I'm video chatting you.

431
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:02,617
- Right now?
- Yes.

432
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,151
It says it's calling you.

433
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:07,922
- It's not comin' through.
- (sighs)

434
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,990
It's still not working?

435
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,960
It's, uh, it's being weird.

436
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:15,429
I... I'll take my phone
in today.

437
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,164
Okay.

438
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:21,268
Sorry.

439
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:23,437
Hey.

440
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,807
- Hey.
- I like you.

441
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:33,480
- I like you too.
- Can I... pretend kiss you?

442
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:35,382
(chuckles softly)

443
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,786
Look, you asked for my help.
Internet kiss your son.

444
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,321
- Eww!
- Jimmy: Come on. Who cares?

445
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,299
- It's not even real!
- You kiss your son, you fuck!

446
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:43,323
If I had a son,

447
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,734
- I would kiss him!
- That's gross!

448
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:45,958
Damn it!
Look, do you love him?

449
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,294
- Yes!
- How much?

450
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,364
- A lot!
- Then fucking kiss him already!

451
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,767
So...

452
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,737
(upbeat music playing)

453
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm kissing you.

454
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,853
And I'm kissing you back.

455
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:18,727
(grunts)

456
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,828
(upbeat music playing)

457
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,973
- (music stops)
- Franklin.

458
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:37,144
(water rushing)

459
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:43,083
(phone pings)

460
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,519
(sighs)

461
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,421
Oh... God.

462
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:48,689
Becca: Hey!

463
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,791
Yeah. What's up?

464
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:53,561
Hey, would you be up
for a quick phone call?

465
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,829
- Uh...
- It's just a little weird

466
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,264
that we've never
actually talked.

467
00:29:57,398 --> 00:29:59,433
And it'd make me feel
a lot better if we did.

468
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,969
I'm just really busy right now.

469
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,039
Then maybe we should
wait to keep messaging

470
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:06,708
until you can chat.

471
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:10,010
(chuckles) But we were
having such a fun time.

472
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,513
Let me know.

473
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,386
(paper ripping)

474
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,032
(romantic music
playing in background)

475
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:35,102
(Erica and Chuck smooching)

476
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:42,510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

477
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:47,848
- I have a really fun idea.
- I'll do anything with you.

478
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,918
- It's kinda weird.
- I like weird. (chuckles)

479
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,621
All right. So, um...
(clears throat)

480
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,826
...my... my son and I have this
weird tradition where we like,

481
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,265
you know, prank call each other,

482
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,062
and I thought
it would be really funny

483
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,632
if we like prank called him
as his girlfriend.

484
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:07,569
You know, really, you know,
make him believe that it's her.

485
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:09,102
And then, later on,
I could be like,

486
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,973
"That was me." (laughs)

487
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:17,846
Wouldn't he know...
it wasn't her?

488
00:31:17,978 --> 00:31:19,378
That's the thing.
They've never met.

489
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,583
He just knows her online.

490
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:25,152
- Huh.
- And I was wondering...

491
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:30,725
it would add a little...
authenticity to the prank.

492
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:34,061
Could you call him
and be the voice?

493
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:37,097
- I don't want to do that.
- Erica. It's really, really fun.

494
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,365
That sounds mean and stupid.

495
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,802
No, no, no.
He... he does it to me.

496
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,169
It's like our thing.

497
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:45,172
One time, he prank called me
pretending to be my ex-wife.

498
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,442
(chuckles) I was like,
"What? No way!"

499
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:54,582
(laughs)

500
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:56,893
Erica: It sounds like
you're literally

501
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,419
making this up right now.

502
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,054
Thought this would
actually be a fun way to...

503
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,658
kind of bring you
into my life more, but...

504
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,898
I'll do it
if you sext me at work.

505
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,599
Oh... I don't like doing that.

506
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
Hmm... I don't like
doing made-up pranks

507
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,445
to people's kids I've never met
that don't make any sense.

508
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,772
Why don't we
just have regular sex?

509
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:20,307
Because. You're not good at it.

510
00:32:24,846 --> 00:32:27,381
(crickets stridulating)

511
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:32,986
(phone vibrating)

512
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,331
Hello?

513
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,434
- Is this...
- Erica: <i>Franklin?</i>

514
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:49,671
<i>Is... is this a good time?</i>

515
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,306
Yeah, I was just... yeah, sorry.

516
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,983
I... I was... I was just...
I was literally just

517
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,944
<i>in the middle... uh, yeah.
What's goin' on?</i>

518
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,411
Uh, how's your day going?

519
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,214
Franklin: <i>Pretty good.
How's it goin' with you?</i>

520
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,416
What are you wearing?

521
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,589
Just sweatpants
and a Red Sox shirt.

522
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:11,526
- Uh, what... what about you?
- Just a dress.

523
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:14,428
- Franklin: <i>Oh, awesome.</i>
- No panties.

524
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:20,234
- Sorry?
- Just got out of the shower.

525
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:23,403
Oh, hopefully you did
your laundry so that...

526
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,707
there are clean towels.

527
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,712
Your voice is sexy.

528
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,046
Franklin: <i>I'm actually
not good on the phone.</i>

529
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,949
- <i>Uh, to be totally honest.</i>
- What?

530
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:36,684
Me neither.

531
00:33:37,217 --> 00:33:38,620
Do you want to
just meet in person?

532
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:40,788
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Sure, I'd love to.

533
00:33:40,989 --> 00:33:44,057
Franklin: <i>Okay, awesome.
Uh, see you soon.</i>

534
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,093
Sounds great. See you soon.

535
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,665
- What was that?
- Yeah. What the fuck was that?

536
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:53,668
- It was a game.
- Tell me the truth.

537
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,168
- I told you that...
- No.

538
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:56,738
(Chuck stammers)

539
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:01,475
Look, whatever it is, it's okay.

540
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:06,014
- I'll understand.
- (sighs)

541
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:09,082
- Get the fuck out!
- You said it would be okay!

542
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,384
You're a piece of shit!

543
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:12,954
Lying to your son isn't
gonna get you closer to him!

544
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:16,223
- Well, it might.
- (door slams)

545
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,594
- (mellow music playing)
- (crickets stridulating)

546
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,902
I can't wait to meet you.

547
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:31,238
(mellow music continues)

548
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:45,485
Your counselor said that you
can't travel alone for a year.

549
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,889
And... and you don't even have
your driver's license.

550
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,023
Can you drive me then?

551
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,625
Can I take you to meet this...?

552
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,670
- No, I can't. I'm sorry.
- Franklin: It'll be fun.

553
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,863
I have a practice.
I can't just pick up and leave.

554
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,331
But I'll get permission

555
00:34:57,532 --> 00:35:00,133
from my treatment team
and everything. I promise.

556
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,736
(Diane sighs)

557
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,540
Please.

558
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:08,241
Diane: I'm sorry, honey.

559
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,650
- I can't believe she said no.
- I know. I...

560
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:38,806
(cell phone ringing, vibrating)

561
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:48,248
Hello?

562
00:35:49,117 --> 00:35:51,284
- Dad?
- (chuckling) Hey.

563
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:55,623
- Um, what's goin' on?
- I think I need a ride.

564
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,258
Where?

565
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,662
Franklin:
<i>To meet a girl in Maine.</i>

566
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:02,530
<i>Near you.</i>

567
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,903
- It's too far.
- No, no. Uh, I just...

568
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:10,437
Franklin: <i>You don't have
to explain.</i>

569
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,298
Chuck: <i>There's just
a lot of work stuff.</i>

570
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:13,608
Don't.

571
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:22,315
Becca:
<i>I just think it's very cool</i>

572
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,018
<i>that he's willing
to drive all that way.</i>

573
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:25,986
I mean, what, he's got to drive

574
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,320
all the way down to you,

575
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,891
and then all the way back
to where he lives.

576
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,627
He must care a lot about you.

577
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:36,931
Becca, my dad is fucked up.

578
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:39,232
He's got something
wrong with him.

579
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:42,070
Everyone's got something, right?

580
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:43,370
Yeah, but I don't even...

581
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,173
I feel like I don't even
know who he...

582
00:36:45,305 --> 00:36:46,741
like everything he does
is bullshit.

583
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,744
He's like, he...
he's a compulsive liar.

584
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:54,615
(keyboard clacking)

585
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,118
(scoffs) He doesn't sound
that bad.

586
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,722
Let me...
I mean, what's a good...

587
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:04,092
okay, this is a dumb thing,
but I feel like it...

588
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:07,662
He used to be obsessed
with online chess.

589
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:10,631
- We should play.
- Um... Maybe later.

590
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,032
- Yeah.
- Okay.

591
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,134
Okay.

592
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:15,937
Anyway, he was playing
all the time,

593
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,206
and was the top of
all these online leagues,

594
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:19,583
he was winning
all these awards...

595
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,241
Wow. I mean,
I would be super proud.

596
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:24,244
But then one day, he shows me
how he's winning so much.

597
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,580
And what he would do is

598
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:26,990
he would play
against somebody online,

599
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,315
but then be playing
the same game

600
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,684
against a computer.

601
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:32,954
Whatever move this guy makes,
I use that move in this game.

602
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,687
Franklin: <i>And he would
the players' moves</i>

603
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,389
<i>and use them
against the computer</i>

604
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,492
<i>and then take the computer's
perfect moves,</i>

605
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,204
<i>and then use them back
against the player.</i>

606
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:41,939
And they just play against
each other the whole time.

607
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:44,003
And then I'm just moving
right up the leader boards.

608
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:45,365
He'd just cheat.

609
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,936
And that was how he did
his whole life.

610
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:53,574
(playful music playing)

611
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,543
I'm taking a road trip
with my son.

612
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:59,446
- Jimmy: <i>Chuck, she's not real!</i>
- My Becca's not real!

613
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,915
Jimmy: <i>What are you
talking about?</i>

614
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,618
I'm going to introduce him
to the real Becca.

615
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,953
- The one from the diner.
- Jimmy: <i>Abort!</i>

616
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,522
Chuck: Let me explain!

617
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,298
Jimmy: <i>So your plan
is to introduce your son</i>

618
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,362
<i>to this random diner girl.</i>

619
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,893
Chuck: She's a nice girl.

620
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:13,866
He's a great kid.
And they're gonna hit it off!

621
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,630
Jimmy: <i>She's a total stranger!</i>

622
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,007
Chuck: She's not.
She's a nice girl

623
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:18,666
who makes faces at kids.
She's funny.

624
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,520
Jimmy: <i>You're about to ruin
your son's life!</i>

625
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:21,869
I'm here.

626
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:23,604
Jimmy: <i>Chuck,
listen to me, okay?</i>

627
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,149
<i>Come clean.
Just tell him everything.</i>

628
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,941
<i>Tell him
and face the consequences,</i>

629
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,685
<i>but don't do this. Don't
be a fucking idiot, Chuck!</i>

630
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,011
Whatever it takes, Jimmy.

631
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,683
- Jimmy: <i>He's gonna find out!</i>
- Chuck: Whatever it takes.

632
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:35,482
Diane: He's just, uh,
finishing packing up.

633
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:36,951
Place looks great!

634
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,554
I love what you did
with the... lawn.

635
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,189
This whole thing is a dumb idea.

636
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,848
And he doesn't even
know this girl,

637
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,293
- she could be anybody.
- Totally agree.

638
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,795
I'm gonna to talk him.
I'm gonna engage.

639
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,089
- There he is! (chuckles)
- Diane: Got everything?

640
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,767
Come here. Okay. Love you.

641
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,968
Love you too.

642
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:56,971
- Here.
- I... I got it.

643
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:58,706
Yeah.

644
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,809
Diane: This could be
incredibly destabilizing.

645
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,476
Chuck: I know.

646
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:06,013
If anything goes wrong,
it's your responsibility.

647
00:39:06,914 --> 00:39:08,015
Trusting you.

648
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,018
(softly chuckles)

649
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,989
(soft country music playing)

650
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:33,107
- So, how's it bein' back home?
- Good.

651
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:35,276
What kind of stuff you doin'?

652
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:39,714
- I don't know.
- Watching anything good on TV?

653
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:44,085
So many shows out now, you know?

654
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,122
Think there'll be
even more shows?

655
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:51,225
Like, in the future?

656
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,640
Do I think there will be even
more TV shows in the future?

657
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:55,094
That's what
you're asking right now?

658
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,140
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
- Why are you asking me that?

659
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,733
Well, what do you
wanna talk about?

660
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,068
- Nothing.
- You coding maybe?

661
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:05,940
How do you know about my coding?

662
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,977
I don't know.
Your mom or something.

663
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:20,054
(country music fades)

664
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:21,421
(keypad clacking)

665
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:23,557
- (message tone beeps)
- (phone vibrating)

666
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,426
(grunts)

667
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,634
(keypad clacking)

668
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:36,003
- (message tone beeps)
- (phone vibrating)

669
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,772
(exhales heavily)

670
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,741
(phone ringing)

671
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,113
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

672
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:49,617
- All right, one sec.
- (chuckles softly)

673
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,020
Hello? Becca?

674
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:54,789
- Becca? Hello?
- (laughs)

675
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:56,891
Hey, can you hear me?

676
00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:00,895
Hello? Hello?
Hello, Becca?

677
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:02,462
So, I... I can just hear myself.

678
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,577
I can't... hey, hello?
Hello? I'll... I'll call.

679
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,335
Uh, call me.
I'll call you in a little bit.

680
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,771
Okay. If you can hear me,
okay, bye.

681
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:16,644
(exhales) Not there, huh?

682
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:22,116
(chuckles softly)

683
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:28,155
(soft tense music playing)

684
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,734
(sighs)

685
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,971
(both moan)

686
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,307
Chuck: You ready, bud?

687
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,576
- Hey, you ready?
- What are you...

688
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:51,946
- Can you please not do that?
- Chuck: Oh, sorry.

689
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:01,655
(soft suspenseful music playing)

690
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:10,965
(whispers) Okay.

691
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,836
- What are you wearing?
- (keypad clacking)

692
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,039
(message tone beeps)

693
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,809
(cell phone vibrates)

694
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,549
Franklin: <i>What are you wearing?</i>

695
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:41,295
(water gushing)

696
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:46,100
Franklin: I'm in my underwear.

697
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,636
- (message tone beeps)
- (cell phone vibrates)

698
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:53,040
Franklin: <i>I'm in my underwear.</i>

699
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:58,112
(sighs)

700
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,882
(exhales deeply, muttering)
What am I doing?

701
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:04,351
- What am I doing?
- (message tone beeps)

702
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,820
(cell phone vibrates)

703
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:07,898
Franklin: <i>Sorry.
I was trying to talk dirty</i>

704
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:09,824
<i>like you did on our phone call.</i>

705
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,991
(sighs)

706
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,932
Becca: <i>I was being crazy.
I'm not really like that.</i>

707
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,834
(message tone beeps)

708
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,602
Franklin:
<i>It's fine if you don't want to.</i>

709
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:25,272
Becca: <i>I think it's better
if we wait.</i>

710
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:29,710
- (keypad clacking)
- (muttering indistinctly)

711
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,879
Franklin: <i>I get it. I'm a loser.</i>

712
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:34,915
- Becca: <i>You're not a loser.</i>
- (message tone beeps)

713
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:38,719
Franklin: <i>I am, actually.
I am a fucking loser.</i>

714
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:55,035
(knocks on door)

715
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:56,680
- Franklin: <i>I'm in here.</i>
- Yeah. Uh...

716
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:57,984
(clears throat) <i>How much longer?</i>

717
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,107
- I don't know.
- Chuck: <i>Okay. I just, um...</i>

718
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:04,411
I just wanted to let you know
that I think you're awesome.

719
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,814
Why're... Thank you.

720
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:12,486
- (message tone beeps)
- (cell phone vibrates)

721
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:13,821
Franklin: <i>I hate myself.</i>

722
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:17,158
(soft suspenseful music playing)

723
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:21,795
(sighs)

724
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,432
Chuck: Whatever move
this guy makes,

725
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,334
I use that move in this game.

726
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:29,538
And then whatever move
he makes against that move,

727
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,706
I use it back on this game.
I make the guys play each other.

728
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,509
They think they're playin' me.

729
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,411
(soft suspenseful music ends)

730
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,550
(upbeat music
playing in background)

731
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:44,919
(indistinct chatter)

732
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,393
Chuck: <i>Hey, you there?</i>

733
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:57,198
- Erica: <i>What?</i>
- (message tone beeps)

734
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,800
Chuck: <i>I deleted
the account and everything.</i>

735
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:02,136
<i>- You were right.</i>
- (keypad clacking)

736
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:04,972
- Erica: <i>You promise?</i>
- (message tone beeps)

737
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,474
Chuck: <i>What you said
made an impact on me.</i>

738
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:10,311
- Erica: <i>Wow.</i>
- (message tone beeps)

739
00:45:10,444 --> 00:45:13,247
Chuck: <i>And...
I owe you something.</i>

740
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:16,784
Erica: <i>Make me want it.</i>

741
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:19,987
(keypad clacking)

742
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:21,422
(message tone beeps)

743
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,859
I'm in my underwear.

744
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:31,031
Well, that turns me on.

745
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,203
- (water running)
- (cell phone vibrates)

746
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:42,876
Well, that turns me on.

747
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:46,615
About wearing underwear.

748
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:50,317
(soft tense music playing)

749
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:58,826
(breathes heavily)

750
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:13,841
(water running)

751
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:17,444
What do you wanna do to me?

752
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,722
- Chuck: Paste. Send.
- (message tone beeps)

753
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:29,990
What do you wanna do to me?

754
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,127
I'm kissing you.

755
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:39,500
(both smooching, panting)

756
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:42,036
Franklin: All over.

757
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:45,839
(both moaning)

758
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:56,417
Franklin: What are you
doing to me?

759
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:58,787
Chuck: Kissing you all over.

760
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,388
Don't be a fucking pussy, Chuck.

761
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:02,856
What are you doin' to me?

762
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,993
I'm sliding my hand
around your cock.

763
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:08,195
(exhales nervously)

764
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,170
I'm sliding my hand
around your cock.

765
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:19,206
I'm kinda moving
my body back and forth

766
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,675
so your hand doesn't get tired.

767
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:23,477
Back and forth to...

768
00:47:25,379 --> 00:47:26,614
Okay.

769
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:31,251
And I'm kinda moving
my body back and forth

770
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:33,253
so your hand doesn't get tired.

771
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:35,456
Now I'm using my mouth.

772
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,061
Now I'm using my mouth.

773
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,299
I'm seriously
so erect right now.

774
00:47:47,535 --> 00:47:50,003
I'm seriously
so erect right now.

775
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:52,607
What?

776
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:57,010
(groans)

777
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:58,680
What?

778
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:04,451
- Like... your boobs?
- Yeah, my boobs are erect.

779
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,453
(chuckles)

780
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:08,222
Oh, I didn't know
you were so good...

781
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:09,933
- ...at doing this.
- You feel so good inside me.

782
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:12,326
- You feel so good too.
- God, I want you inside me.

783
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:13,894
- I thought I was.
- You are.

784
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:17,297
- I'm imagining it.
- (both moaning)

785
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:33,180
Franklin,
I gotta use the bathroom.

786
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:35,449
- Franklin: <i>One second.</i>
- No, right now! I gotta go!

787
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:37,719
- I said one second!
- Franklin!

788
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,019
What the fuck!

789
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:40,498
Hey, I just gotta
use the bathroom.

790
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:41,766
Can't I just have
a fucking second?

791
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,223
Whoa, where is this coming from?

792
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:44,367
- You're smothering me.
- I'm... I'm smothering you?

793
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:45,631
Franklin: You're smothering me!

794
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,127
Chuck: I haven't seen you
in a year.

795
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:48,739
- Yeah, whose fault is that?
- (scoffs) Oh, my God.

796
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:50,097
Oh, you think this is funny?

797
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:52,567
I send you a billion messages.
I never hear back.

798
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,134
Franklin:
'Cause that's all you do.

799
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:55,837
That's all you do.
You post on my wall.

800
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:57,515
- You think that's showing up?
- Your wife and kid hate you,

801
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:58,907
how fun you think it is
to show up?

802
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,407
That's what you signed up for.

803
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:03,645
- I signed up for a family.
- I am your family!

804
00:49:07,749 --> 00:49:09,851
We're both
really tired right now...

805
00:49:09,983 --> 00:49:11,753
I'm tired of pretending
we're okay.

806
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,888
You want to know
why I cut you out?

807
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,122
Because you're a liar.

808
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,534
You're selfish
and you're a liar.

809
00:49:16,558 --> 00:49:17,558
Come on.

810
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:19,302
Every time you said
you'd be there, you never were.

811
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:20,686
Every time
you could have shown up,

812
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,564
you just cut corners
and I'm sick of it!

813
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:25,432
- Frank... Franklin...
- I needed you.

814
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,034
And you weren't there.

815
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,369
You weren't there.

816
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,239
I'm not perfect.

817
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:34,050
- You're not fucking perfect.
- Chuck: I just...

818
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:35,351
yeah,
I just said I wasn't, okay?

819
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,620
- I'm trying.
- You're really not.

820
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:38,004
I'm here... now.
If... if I gotta...

821
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:40,214
do every little thing
for the rest of my life

822
00:49:40,347 --> 00:49:42,049
to make up for it, I will.

823
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:47,822
Let's... let's just, uh,
like talk to each other. Okay?

824
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:49,858
You sit there
on the other chair.

825
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:51,391
We can sit and talk, all right?

826
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:57,397
(breathes heavily)

827
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,203
I'm trying to rebuild

828
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,607
from a thing
that I know that I broke.

829
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:07,909
I broke it.

830
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,546
And this is the... this is me
doing my best to fix it.

831
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,348
Mom was right. This whole thing
was a bad idea.

832
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:18,085
(door opens)

833
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:21,021
- Chuck: Franklin.
- (door closes)

834
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:28,428
(dramatic music playing)

835
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:41,809
(indistinct chatter)

836
00:51:07,535 --> 00:51:10,738
(soft perky music playing)

837
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,260
You wanna try?

838
00:51:33,962 --> 00:51:35,195
Try what?

839
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:36,764
Driving.

840
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:41,468
- No.
- Come on.

841
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:47,441
- I never got my license.
- It's easy.

842
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:54,114
(soft perky music playing)

843
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:04,124
Let's switch.

844
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,697
(car door closes)

845
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:13,534
- Friend...
- Dad, no.

846
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:25,046
Chuck: All right,
foot on the brake

847
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:26,981
and put it in drive.

848
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:29,149
Okay. When do I...

849
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:30,628
Chuck: Just give it...
give it some gas.

850
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:31,972
Foot on the gas pedal
right there.

851
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:34,856
Stop. Stop, stop, stop
till you have an opening.

852
00:52:35,056 --> 00:52:37,992
- Franklin: Okay.
- Chuck: No, stop. Stop. No.

853
00:52:38,126 --> 00:52:40,160
This guy's a fuckin' asshole.
Foot on the brake.

854
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:41,796
There you go, there you go.

855
00:52:53,173 --> 00:52:56,176
Franklin, you're a natural.
You're a natural at this.

856
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:58,613
I was a mess
the first time I did this.

857
00:52:58,746 --> 00:52:59,781
Oh my God.

858
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:01,354
Okay, we're gonna
switch lanes again.

859
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:02,884
I want you to get
in the left lane.

860
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:04,695
- Okay. Left lane.
- There you go. There's the signal.

861
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,420
Check your mirrors.
Everything clear?

862
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:08,956
- All right, go to the left.
- Check. Moving to left.

863
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,801
- I'm moving to left.
- And now turn your signal off

864
00:53:10,825 --> 00:53:12,665
'cause you're in the left lane,
and you did it.

865
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,929
- What do all the lights mean?
- Which ones?

866
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:18,432
The one with the...
the engine light.

867
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,106
Oh, that thing's
been on for a while.

868
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,501
That... that's just to...

869
00:53:21,636 --> 00:53:23,047
the manufacturers
make that thing go on

870
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,872
so you'll go in
and pay for more repairs.

871
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,273
It's nothing.

872
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:28,743
Chuck:
Just go straight that way.

873
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:30,377
That parking space
straight ahead,

874
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:31,679
straight ahead.

875
00:53:31,813 --> 00:53:34,082
There you go
and put the brake pad.

876
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,684
- (tires screeching)
- Chuck: And put it in park.

877
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:37,952
Welcome home.

878
00:53:44,224 --> 00:53:47,762
(birds chirping)

879
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:48,963
(Chuck grunts)

880
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,934
Right over there.
Straight ahead.

881
00:53:57,872 --> 00:54:01,274
- You still have that thing?
- I'm never getting rid of this.

882
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:06,814
You want it?

883
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:10,952
- What do you mean?
- The car. To keep.

884
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:12,887
It's yours.

885
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,593
Okay.

886
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:25,432
(soft tense music playing)

887
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,035
(chopping)

888
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:32,305
(Franklin sighs)

889
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,947
(keypad clacking)

890
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:42,917
- (message tone beeps)
- (cell phone vibrates)

891
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,789
Franklin: <i>I can't stop
thinkin' about last night.</i>

892
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,569
- (sighs)
- (cell phone vibrates)

893
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,425
Franklin: <i>You were amazing.</i>

894
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:54,962
Becca: <i>How was the trip?</i>

895
00:54:55,163 --> 00:54:56,707
Franklin: <i>Want to finish
what we started?</i>

896
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:58,633
Becca:
<i>Can't do that right now. Sorry.</i>

897
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:02,170
You're lucky you get to spend
all this time with your dad.

898
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,906
Yeah, well, if you knew him,
you'd think different.

899
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:10,343
My dad and I fought a lot
before he passed away.

900
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:12,613
It wasn't worth it.

901
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,382
Oh my God, Becca. I'm so sorry.

902
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:18,252
I... I feel like an idiot.
I had no idea.

903
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:20,822
Yeah, he wasn't
always around either.

904
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:26,093
And then one day
we were having this...

905
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:30,497
(inhales, exhales deeply)
...big stupid fight and...

906
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:35,903
and then he just died.

907
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,371
Heart attack.

908
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,741
And I never saw him again.

909
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:43,077
And I will never see him again.

910
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:46,948
- Oh, my God, Becca.
- (Becca sniffles)

911
00:55:47,315 --> 00:55:51,219
And then, you know,
when I started missing him,

912
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:54,021
I just... I wanted to call.

913
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,191
And I... I couldn't.

914
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:01,896
I tried. I called
over and over but...

915
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:05,900
he was gone.

916
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:09,637
(sobs)

917
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:12,974
(inhales deeply)

918
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,344
Through that experience,
I realized

919
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,846
that I should have
just forgiven him.

920
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:24,484
And, uh, I also realized
that I love him

921
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:27,154
way more than
I love my mom. So.

922
00:56:30,423 --> 00:56:31,592
Huh.

923
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:35,563
Wow. That's...

924
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:38,666
Wow. (exhales)

925
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,602
(keypad clacking)

926
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:44,572
Remember, your dad
was just some guy

927
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:48,542
who ended up having a kid
and is now just...

928
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:51,012
trying his best.

929
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:02,623
Um, apples and peanut butter
almost done.

930
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,109
Night.

931
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,980
(grunts)

932
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:30,651
Good night, Franklin.

933
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,596
Becca: <i>Derek, you are
the most thoughtful,</i>

934
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:46,067
<i>unique, and kind person
I've ever met. And...</i>

935
00:57:46,534 --> 00:57:47,935
<i>I love you.</i>

936
00:57:57,044 --> 00:58:00,614
Diane: <i>And he's doing okay?
No major mood fluctuations?</i>

937
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,850
No, we're having a great time.

938
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,218
Uh-huh. Well,

939
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:07,455
if you notice anything
off with him, please call me.

940
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:09,123
Chuck: <i>I will. Right away.</i>

941
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:13,094
All right. Well...

942
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,064
<i>I know this means a lot to him.</i>

943
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,870
Chuck:
I'd do anything for Frankie.

944
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:34,181
Becca: Hey there.
Uh, Chuck. Right?

945
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:35,750
Yeah! Hey. (chuckles)

946
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:38,052
- Have you been helped?
- Um...

947
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:43,791
- Oh, shoot! Shoot! Um...
- Ow.

948
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:46,861
No worries.
Happens all the time. Seriously.

949
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:50,097
Ugh, I've been on the road
all day with my son.

950
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:51,766
I'm taking him to meet a girl.

951
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:53,334
- Your son?
- Chuck: Uh-huh.

952
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,403
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

953
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:56,704
We eating today?

954
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,939
Relationships
can be so tricky though.

955
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,308
- Tell me about it.
- Chuck: Right?

956
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:03,077
- Yeah.
- (chuckles) You in one?

957
00:59:04,078 --> 00:59:05,646
- What?
- Like, you know,

958
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,349
- do you have a boyfriend or...?
- Why do you ask?

959
00:59:08,682 --> 00:59:11,152
Just making conversation,
I guess.

960
00:59:12,286 --> 00:59:13,721
I'll come back
when you're ready.

961
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:15,856
Okay? Yeah.

962
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:19,560
(soft tense music playing)

963
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:28,169
Becca: <i>Derek,
you are the most thoughtful,</i>

964
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,238
<i>unique, and kind person
I've ever met.</i>

965
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:33,207
<i>And... I love you.</i>

966
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:16,617
So...

967
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:19,186
what's the plan?

968
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,190
Becca?

969
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:26,092
Sorry.

970
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,467
- Hey, for a second I thought...
- I'm freaking out.

971
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,934
(inhales, exhales)

972
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:36,270
Is there someone else?

973
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:38,471
No.

974
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:40,307
What is it then?

975
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:44,411
You're a great guy. I'm just...

976
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,082
going through a lot of
my own stuff right now.

977
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,583
Like what?

978
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:52,920
(dramatic music playing)

979
01:00:53,053 --> 01:00:54,922
I'm movin' to California.

980
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,995
(water splashes)

981
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:03,864
What? Why? Since when?

982
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,867
Becca: I've been wanting to
for a while.

983
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:10,572
How come
you've never said anything?

984
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,473
It just came up.
There's a job there.

985
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:13,841
Maybe even Japan.

986
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:15,577
What are you talking...?

987
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:16,949
Can you get on a call right now?

988
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:19,380
You're gonna meet
someone so incredible.

989
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:20,582
I know it.

990
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,416
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

991
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,123
- I'm sorry.
- (water splashes)

992
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,372
(crying)

993
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:59,353
(sniffles)

994
01:02:15,436 --> 01:02:16,870
(Chuck exhales)

995
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,444
She ended it.

996
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:26,880
- What?
- We were talking...

997
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:29,116
she stopped responding...

998
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:32,886
then she freaked out
and said she was done.

999
01:02:33,588 --> 01:02:35,990
- Franklin...
- I don't know what happened.

1000
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:43,797
I mean, if you think about it,
maybe this is a good thing.

1001
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:45,866
What?

1002
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,110
Chuck: That you're
finding this out now.

1003
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:48,269
I mean, she's showing you

1004
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:49,970
this whole different
side of herself.

1005
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,507
You don't wanna be
with someone like this.

1006
01:02:57,378 --> 01:02:59,980
(chuckles) I mean,
fuck her. Right?

1007
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:02,216
Don't talk about her that way.

1008
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:03,960
- No, I just meant...
- I don't care what you meant.

1009
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:04,995
- That's my girlfriend.
- Franklin...

1010
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,019
No, no, not fuck her.

1011
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,855
- Come on.
- Fuck you.

1012
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:38,085
(dramatic music playing)

1013
01:03:39,788 --> 01:03:42,056
(water splashing)

1014
01:04:28,502 --> 01:04:33,173
Chuck: (muffled)
Franklin! Franklin!

1015
01:04:38,713 --> 01:04:40,280
(water splashing)

1016
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:42,883
- (Franklin coughing)
- What are you doing?

1017
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:47,454
(coughing)

1018
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:52,459
I don't know. (crying)

1019
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:21,388
(thunder rumbling)

1020
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:33,367
(birds chirping)

1021
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:18,479
Becca: Franklin.

1022
01:06:20,815 --> 01:06:24,351
I'm worried you won't like
the person I am in real life.

1023
01:06:24,485 --> 01:06:25,485
But...

1024
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:31,158
you are the most thoughtful,
unique...

1025
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:36,531
and kind person I've ever met.

1026
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:44,739
And I love you.

1027
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:52,647
Jimmy: <i>All right.
Here we go y'all</i>

1028
01:06:53,113 --> 01:06:54,549
<i>A little 98 Degrees.</i>

1029
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,217
Never sang this song
before in my life.

1030
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:59,888
I can pick any song,
because that's how great I am.

1031
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,221
<i>♪ It's all... ♪</i>

1032
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,925
<i>♪ It's all because you're ♪</i>

1033
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:07,529

<i>♪ You're my cure against

1035
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,200
- (applause)
- Whoo! Yeah!

1036
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,702
- Yeah.
<i>- ♪ I'm losing my mind ♪</i>

1037
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,905

1039

01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,314
I mean, she's
just special, you know?

1041
01:07:27,447 --> 01:07:29,416
Like, look.
Like, look what she said.

1042
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,052
Isn't that, like, poetic?

1043
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:34,589
Looks like
she's saying goodbye to me.

1044
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:36,558
(phone pings)

1045
01:07:37,124 --> 01:07:39,561
- Wait, what?
- What... what is it?

1046
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,229
That tech company
Becca sent my stuff to.

1047
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:44,464
They want to meet me
for an interview.

1048
01:07:44,632 --> 01:07:48,235
(chuckles) Wow!

1049
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:52,006
- Right? That's awesome! Oh.
- Great news, man.

1050
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,440
Chuck: Yeah, that's... that's...

1051
01:07:53,775 --> 01:07:55,786
How's it feel spendin'
all this time with your pops?

1052
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,411
Oh, I gotta
tell Becca about this.

1053
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:59,079
Can I give you some advice?

1054
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,481
Just... just real quick
while you focus on that girl.

1055
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:03,051
- You know, you gotta...
- Yeah.

1056
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,762
You can't really just
invest everything into her

1057
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:06,296
like that, you know?
You know, she could be

1058
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,455
like mean or... or a scammer,

1059
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,290
or just a liar.
I mean, or your dad.

1060
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:14,161
(Jimmy and Chuck laugh)

1061
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:18,265
- Jimmy: (laughs) Your dad.
- (laughs)

1062
01:08:18,398 --> 01:08:20,167
Oh. You know, look,

1063
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:22,670
I always say it's best
not to, you know,

1064
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,807
think too far ahead,
and, uh, you know,

1065
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,342
don't look at horses. You know?

1066
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:30,277
You know what I'm saying, Jimmy?

1067
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,370
Jimmy: I... I hear what
you're sayin', you know...

1068
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,248
What I'm saying is keep
your expectations low.

1069
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:39,854
Like really, really low.
Don't put 'em too high,

1070
01:08:39,988 --> 01:08:41,832
'cause you'd get really
disappointed. So, keep 'em low.

1071
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,323
This girl
is the love of my life.

1072
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:44,935
Right, see,
you're still talkin' like...

1073
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,737
the expectation's too high.
Keep it low. Okay?

1074
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:49,463
- People can be really tricky.
- Not Becca.

1075
01:08:49,831 --> 01:08:52,066
You really, really sold
on Becca, ain't you?

1076
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:54,002
- (chuckles)
- She's amazing.

1077
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:55,613
Jimmy: Well, you know something,

1078
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:56,917
I'mma go get
something' stronger,

1079
01:08:57,137 --> 01:08:58,749
because it's too much love
in the building for me.

1080
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:00,942
(chuckles) I'm jealous.
You got all the love.

1081
01:09:01,075 --> 01:09:03,119
Chuck: Take your time gettin'
back. I gotta finish this one.

1082
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,913
Grab one at the bar and,
you know, see you back here.

1083
01:09:06,047 --> 01:09:08,816
- I gotta get out of town more.
- Oh, you come anytime you want.

1084
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:10,785
- Really?
- And I'm gonna visit more.

1085
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,520
- Okay.
- Great.

1086
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:16,289
Can we not tell anybody
about the whole, uh...

1087
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:19,694
- pool thing?
- Between us.

1088
01:09:20,394 --> 01:09:23,397
Emcee: Next up, Chuck Green.
"Boys Don't Cry."

1089
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,533
(laughs) Come on.

1090
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:28,736
- No.
- Come on, come on. (laughing)

1091
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,505
- No, no.
- Chuck: Come on.

1092
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:32,640
I'm not... I'm not doing that.

1093
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:35,710
It's my favorite song.

1094

turned into years and...

1205

It just kept going and going.

1208
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:27,208
And... and... I thought it was...

1209
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,910
I thought it was helping.
And... and it was.

1210
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:32,551
- I'll... I'll be right back.
- Chuck: Let's... let's go.

1211
01:18:32,614 --> 01:18:34,224
- Let's go... let's just go somewhere to talk, okay?
- I'll be right back.

1212
01:18:34,248 --> 01:18:35,825
- We will. We will.
- Let's just sit down.

1213
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:37,318
I'm gonna get you some water.

1214
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,787
We're gonna talk in a bit,
okay? I'll be right back.

1215
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:42,990
It's not her. It's not her.

1216
01:18:43,123 --> 01:18:44,792
(wind chime rings)

1217
01:18:44,959 --> 01:18:46,427
(indistinct chatter)

1218
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:48,905
Real Becca: You want
strawberries or blueberries on that?

1219
01:18:48,929 --> 01:18:50,164
Welcome to Carl's.

1220
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:59,840
So... (indistinct)

1221
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:05,446
Hi.

1222
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,448
Do you want to take a seat?

1223
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:08,916
Oh, I would love to.

1224
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:11,418
Great. I'll...
I'll grab a menu for you.

1225
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,720
Uh...

1226
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:15,256
- What's, uh, what's your name?
- Becca.

1227
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:16,658
I'm Franklin.

1228
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,636
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1229
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,563
I will grab a menu for you.
Do you wanna go over there?

1230
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:23,063
I'll be over there.

1231
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,441
- Real Becca: Okay.
- And I'll see you soon.

1232
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:25,533
Okay.

1233
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:27,835
All right.

1234
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:32,873
Do you guys want any, um...
would you guys like some...

1235
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:37,044
some cream, sugar
for your coffee? Um...

1236
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,313
Great. I'll get that.

1237
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:42,182
And do you want me
to get some more... more water?

1238
01:19:45,886 --> 01:19:47,821
(wind chime rings)

1239
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:49,957
(indistinct chatter)

1240
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:07,107
Hey, excuse me.
I was wondering.

1241
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:09,052
- Could you help me?
- What can I help you with?

1242
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:11,979
I was wondering
what you, uh, would call

1243
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:13,748
the job that you have?

1244
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:15,816
- Busboy.
- Uh, busboy.

1245
01:20:15,949 --> 01:20:18,228
You know, that's... that's weird
because, what if... what if...

1246
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:20,230
what if you were if you were
like a girl or something?

1247
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:23,924
Um... I assume you're a busgirl.

1248
01:20:24,325 --> 01:20:27,428
(laughs) That's... that's funny.

1249
01:20:27,629 --> 01:20:30,532
You are funny.
All right, that was quick.

1250
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:32,634
Real Becca:
All right. Here you go.

1251
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:33,901
Thank you very much.

1252
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:35,979
I'll get you started with water.
Do you wanna hear the specials?

1253
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:37,639
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just here...

1254
01:20:37,806 --> 01:20:40,107
I'm just here eating some food.

1255
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:41,609
(chuckles) Um...

1256
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:44,178
Yeah, we've got...
we've got Belgian waffles.

1257
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:46,614
Uh, those are topped with
strawberries, blueberries

1258
01:20:46,748 --> 01:20:47,915
and whipped cream.

1259
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:49,950
The whipped cream
is also house made. So...

1260
01:20:50,084 --> 01:20:51,919
(chuckles)

1261
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:56,023
Look, I'm thinking like,
you know, I really wanna,

1262
01:20:56,156 --> 01:20:59,761
you know, do something.
We should make a documentary

1263
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,797
about the lives of...
of bus people.

1264
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:04,398
What are you talking about, man?

1265
01:21:04,632 --> 01:21:06,176
Real Becca: Would you like
syrup on the side with that?

1266
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,470
I would like syrup...
everywhere.

1267
01:21:09,604 --> 01:21:12,574
- (chuckles)
- On the waffle everywhere?

1268
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:15,142
Everywhere on the waffle,
in all the little pockets.

1269
01:21:15,376 --> 01:21:18,646
(chuckles) Great.
Okay, then heavy on the syrup.

1270
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,957
Put the syrup on the waffles.
Put the syrup on the side.

1271
01:21:20,981 --> 01:21:24,084
Put the syrup on my face,
put the syrup on my heart.

1272
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:25,778
- I'm sorry?
- Put the syrup everywhere.

1273
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:28,021
Put the syrup all over.
(chuckles)

1274
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:31,058
I'm sorry, I'll stay...
I'll try to stay in it with you.

1275
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:33,160
Let's keep... Sorry. I'll stay.

1276
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:39,466
I'm sorry, you're really
committed to this.

1277
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:41,034
I'm sorry?

1278
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:44,071
I said, you're really committed
to this.

1279
01:21:44,938 --> 01:21:47,609
- It is my job.
- Yeah.

1280
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:49,787
Anyone watching
would be like, oh my God...

1281
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,651
- I gotta get back to work.
- Totally, totally.

1282
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,323
- But... but one more.
- You're actually not even

1283
01:21:53,347 --> 01:21:54,692
- allowed to be back here.
- One more thing.

1284
01:21:54,716 --> 01:21:56,350
Dude, the Health Department
would bug.

1285
01:21:56,483 --> 01:21:57,951
You need to get out. Come on.

1286
01:21:58,218 --> 01:21:59,864
Okay, listen, one more thing.
Fuck. What was it?

1287
01:21:59,888 --> 01:22:01,488
You were right about my dad.

1288
01:22:02,557 --> 01:22:03,758
He is a good guy.

1289
01:22:04,391 --> 01:22:08,128
The story you told me
helped a lot.

1290
01:22:10,665 --> 01:22:12,132
The one about your dad.

1291
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:13,634
Uh...

1292
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:16,303
The one about your dad,
how he passed away?

1293
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,350
I mean, yeah,
my dad's fucked up,

1294
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:19,983
but, I mean, he drove me
all the way out here

1295
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:21,776
to meet you, and...

1296
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:25,012
I mean... he's my dad, you know?

1297
01:22:25,145 --> 01:22:27,948
I mean, sure, he hasn't
always been there but...

1298
01:22:28,883 --> 01:22:30,350
I love my dad.

1299
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:34,955
And I love you.

1300
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:40,060
Uh, you... sorry, you're making
me extremely uncomfortable.

1301
01:22:40,795 --> 01:22:42,831
I can't do the game anymore,
Becca. I'm here.

1302
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:45,603
I can't have you back here, just
like health code stuff. Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:46,701
No, my dad isn't dead,

1304
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:48,903
and I have no idea
what you're talking about...

1305
01:22:49,036 --> 01:22:50,947
- Hey, everything...
- Chuck: I feel a connection to you, man.

1306
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,808
- Dude, get the fuck off!
- (glasses clanking)

1307
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,209
Dad, what are you doing?

1308
01:22:55,342 --> 01:22:56,622
Derek: What the fuck
is going on?

1309
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:58,078
I'm trying to talk
to my girlfriend.

1310
01:22:58,178 --> 01:22:59,814
I have never
seen this guy before.

1311
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:01,525
- Derek: What is he talking about?
- Becca: I don't know

1312
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:03,092
- what he's talking about.
- What the fuck.

1313
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:04,461
We've got a fight
over here at the diner.

1314
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:05,962
That's my girlfriend
you're talking to.

1315
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:07,464
- What?
- This is my fucking girlfriend!

1316
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:09,299
- That is not Becca, okay?
- Franklin: Yes, it is.

1317
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:10,868
- That's not Becca!
- How could you do this?

1318
01:23:10,892 --> 01:23:12,259
Get them away from me.

1319
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,370
- Franklin: We could start fresh.
- Chuck: Frank. Franklin.

1320
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:15,739
- We could start fresh!
- I'm Becca. I'm Becca.

1321
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:17,440
- I'm Becca, all right?
- What? What'd you say?

1322
01:23:17,464 --> 01:23:18,975
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't have a choice.

1323
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:20,343
- I don't know him.
- I gave everything to you.

1324
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:21,636
He's here sometimes...

1325
01:23:21,803 --> 01:23:23,279
When you blocked me,
I started an account.

1326
01:23:23,303 --> 01:23:24,539
I pretended to be Becca.

1327
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:27,250
- What is this? What is this?
- Chuck: You're right, you're right. I'm a liar.

1328
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:28,919
And if you never wanna
talk to me, I understand.

1329
01:23:28,943 --> 01:23:30,788
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't have another choice.

1330
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:32,556
- How do you have all this?
- If I can just be honest...

1331
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,257
if I can just be honest, okay?
When you blocked me,

1332
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:36,350
I started an account
and pretended to be Becca.

1333
01:23:36,483 --> 01:23:38,283
I'm just telling you,
it was just... it was...

1334
01:23:38,418 --> 01:23:40,622
it was just... Franklin,
Franklin, it was just so that

1335
01:23:40,755 --> 01:23:42,398
- I could talk to you, okay?
- No! No, no. No.

1336
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:43,801
Chuck: Franklin,
listen to me, please.

1337
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:50,698
No. No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1338
01:23:54,936 --> 01:23:58,706
No.

1339
01:23:59,707 --> 01:24:02,610
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to talk to you.

1340
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:05,647
(suspenseful music playing)

1341
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:13,555
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1342
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:19,126
(dramatic music playing)

1343
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,683
(music fades)

1344
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:51,191
<i>Hey.</i>

1345
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:54,494
(sentimental music playing)

1346
01:24:54,896 --> 01:24:56,096
Chuck: <i>Franklin...</i>

1347
01:24:57,832 --> 01:25:00,535
<i>I know you'll probably never
want to talk to me again.</i>

1348
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:03,705
<i>I wouldn't either if I were you.</i>

1349
01:25:05,974 --> 01:25:10,477
<i>I remember I wasn't
at your ninth birthday party.</i>

1350
01:25:11,713 --> 01:25:14,181
<i>You and your mom
were so mad at me.</i>

1351
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:17,752
<i>This is lot worse, huh?</i>

1352
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:23,658
<i>I tried to show up this time,
but I got it wrong.</i>

1353
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:25,893
<i>Again.</i>

1354
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:31,966
<i>I've missed out on so much
of your life.</i>

1355
01:25:33,034 --> 01:25:34,954
<i>If we could just go back
to when you were little,</i>

1356
01:25:35,036 --> 01:25:38,039
<i>when we'd take the ferry
to Montauk,</i>

1357
01:25:38,773 --> 01:25:41,141
<i>sing in the car together,
wrestle.</i>

1358
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,579
(exhales)
<i>Maybe it sounds stupid,</i>

1359
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:46,446
<i>but that road trip
we took together</i>

1360
01:25:46,581 --> 01:25:48,850
<i>was the best time
I've had in my whole life.</i>

1361
01:25:51,786 --> 01:25:53,387
<i>I know you're not a kid anymore,</i>

1362
01:25:53,521 --> 01:25:55,790
<i>that you're an adult now.</i>

1363
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:59,594
<i>But you'll always be my son.</i>

1364
01:26:02,964 --> 01:26:05,933
<i>And even if I don't know
how to be the best dad,</i>

1365
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:10,437
<i>I love you
more than you will ever know.</i>

1366
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:14,341
<i>And I'll be here.</i>

1367
01:26:15,777 --> 01:26:16,878
<i>In your corner.</i>

1368
01:26:19,246 --> 01:26:20,347
<i>Forever.</i>

1369
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,483
Chuck: (chuckling)
<i>You're doin' fine.</i>

1370
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:28,355
<i>- You tired?</i>

1371
01:26:31,025 --> 01:26:33,393

1373
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:02,255
Team Manager:
Hey, uh, Franklin?

1374
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:03,925
Hey, sorry.

1375
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:06,304
I just wanted to say
you're doin' a really great job.

1376
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:09,697
Oh. Well, thanks for the job.

1377
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:11,575
Team Manager: Don't thank me.
Thank your friend.

1378
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:13,768
She was pretty adamant
about giving you a shot.

1379
01:27:13,968 --> 01:27:15,570
I'm glad we listened.

Diane: Chuck.

1390
01:29:07,815 --> 01:29:10,852
I'm writing to let you know
you're a fucking asshole.

1391
01:29:12,385 --> 01:29:14,055
But I also wanted
to let you know

1392
01:29:14,188 --> 01:29:18,425
that there's a vacancy
in the apartment building

1393
01:29:18,559 --> 01:29:23,130
across the street
and it looks affordable.

1394
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:33,975
Anyway, fuck you.
And I hope you're well.

1395
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,095
Chuck: Anyway,
I just wanted to call

1396
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:56,764
and thank you for
sending me that letter.

1397
01:29:56,964 --> 01:29:58,404
<i>It'll be nice
to be across the street</i>

1398
01:29:58,431 --> 01:29:59,967
<i>for you guys from now on.</i>

1399
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:01,468
Wait, wait, what?

1400
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:03,971
What do you... what do you...
across the street?

1401
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:08,475
- Are... are you serious?
<i>- The place you suggested.</i>

1402
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,545
- What are you talking about?
- <i>In the letter.</i>

1403
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:12,847
What letter?

1404
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:15,983
<i>The one you sent
a few months ago.</i>

1405
01:30:16,317 --> 01:30:17,752
What... you...

1406
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:23,724
(gasps) You can't just
move in across the street!

1407
01:30:23,858 --> 01:30:26,560
<i>- Diane, you told me to.</i>
- What are you talking about?

1408
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:28,329
<i>In the letter!
You said in the letter!</i>

1409
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:29,864
I didn't send you a letter!

1410
01:30:30,798 --> 01:30:32,867
(muffled) <i>What are you</i>
<i>doing across the street?</i>

1411
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,436
<i>Oh, my God. Take those boxes
and put them back in the truck.</i>
