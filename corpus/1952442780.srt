What's that for?

183
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,448
- Ask him.
- So what is it, Moore?

184
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,434
You get some kind
of rush doing that?

185
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:49,491
Running around...

186
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:50,834
Like a maniac?

187
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,498
Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,034
It's called Parkour.

189
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,955
- Par-what?
- Parkour.

190
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,931
It's French for "running
around like a maniac."

191
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,019
Oh yes!

192
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,105
Let's go!

193
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,908
Curb-side service, Moore.

194
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,789
Young lady awaits.

195
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,749
(Laughing)

196
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,533
- Thanks, Dad.
- You're welcome.

197
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:22,877
(Laughing)

198
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:23,999
Moore...

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,505
Behave yourself.

200
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,122
- Dad?
- Ha-ha!

201
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:30,659
Well...

202
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,379
I thought they were gonna
throw me in the East River!

203
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,077
I guess I convinced
them not to.

204
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:36,037
I don't...

205
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,957
I don't know what to say.

206
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,429
"Thanks" would be good.

207
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,124
Thanks.

208
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,844
Dinner would be better.

209
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,109
Do you like Italian?

210
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,613
Sounds good.

211
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:56,294
It's him.

212
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,279
Feet!

213
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:07,979
Where you been?

214
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,707
Dad, I met this
really great girl!

215
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,692
We were so worried.
We tried to call.

216
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:12,973
But your phone wasn't...

217
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,286
My cell phone is dead.

218
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,536
What? What's the matter?

219
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,880
Something wrong?

220
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,178
I can't believe you'd
do something this stupid.

221
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,154
Your last year of Columbia Law.
You get arrested?

222
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:28,659
What were you thinking?

223
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,698
I was just blowing off
a little steam.

224
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,163
Your father went
to the precinct.

225
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,636
To bail you out.

226
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,811
And they said you were gone.

227
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,659
They couldn't tell us
where you were.

228
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,196
(Crying)

229
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:43,604
Mom...

230
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:44,789
I'm so sorry.

231
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,190
No!

232
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,751
No, don't! No,
I'm really mad at you!

233
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,096
Mom, Mom...

234
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,099
Chris, you know how
important school is.

235
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,307
The sacrifices
we've all had to make.

236
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,004
Even with your scholarship.

237
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:01,819
If you don't get your grades up,
they're not gonna renew it.

238
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,707
And then we are well
and royally screwed.

239
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,077
So I want you to promise me
that you'll buckle down

240
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:07,263
over the next few weeks.

241
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:08,416
No going out...

242
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,441
- Dad, I'm 24.
- So what?

243
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:11,426
So it sounds like
you're grounding me.

244
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:12,835
You know what I'm saying.

245
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,403
No hanging out,
no distractions.

246
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:15,938
None of this "parquet" stuff.

247
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,050
- Parkour.
- Whatever

248
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:21,507
All you gotta do is nail these
midterms, go another semester,

249
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,395
and then you can
write your own ticket.

250
00:12:23,396 --> 00:12:24,612
And you can take care

251
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,076
of your mother and me
in our golden years.

252
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:28,516
Yeah, right.

253
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:30,342
So do I have your word?

254
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:32,933
Yeah.

255
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,854
All right.
Then get to it.

256
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,822
Chris, what was it
you were telling your dad

257
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,391
about that girl you met?

258
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,448
Hmm?

259
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,259
- Ready for field test
9-alpha-niner.

00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,691

<i>Subject: Gardner,

265
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,612
She totally flakes on me.

266
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:12,588
Yeah, and so now
I'm stuck doing everything.

267
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,059
Uh-huh.

268
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,811
<i>- OK, start her up.
- Yeah, no. I know.</i>

269
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,634
You told me she was unreliable,

270
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,044
<i>but what am I gonna do?</i>

271
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:21,036
<i>She volunteered.</i>

272
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,925
Initiating.
Target defined.

(Man): Subject is in
position. Green for go.

274
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,254
Repeat: Green for go.

275
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,397
All right, I'll see you
at the meeting. OK, bye.

276
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:31,952
(Sighing)

Signal strength: 93%.

279
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,116
Initiate the sequence.

280
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:42,227
And...

281
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:43,220
Mark.

282
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:44,500
Initiating.

283
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,975
Initiating indoctrination code.

284
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,575
Sequence beta 3.

285
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,135
Decreasing temporal
dithering to zero.

286
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,753
Initiating indoctrination code.

287
00:14:09,754 --> 00:14:11,417
Sequence beta 3.

288
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,976
(Static)

289
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,569
And... terminate broadcast.

290
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,355
<i>Mom, I have some intuition.</i>

291
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,850
<i>That's what you
said the last time.</i>

292
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,512
(♪ Humming ♪)

293
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,478
(Sirens in distance)

294
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,816
- So by providing a supply-
and-distribution chain

295
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:56,473
that enhances our
macro-global matrix,

296
00:14:56,474 --> 00:15:00,025
we increase influence, control

297
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,273
and, of course...

298
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:03,993
Profits.

299
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,041
What about
conflict of interest?

300
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,794
I am so glad you asked
that question, Pete.

301
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,258
You see, under
this new paradigm,

302
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:12,986
there is no interest.

303
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:15,482
And ergo, there
can be no conflict.

304
00:15:15,483 --> 00:15:18,747
The situation doesn't even have
to get hot for us to profit.

305
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:20,763
- What about the
Ben-David situation?

306
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:22,365
I'm so sorry,
Mr. McDowell.

307
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:24,540
Could you be
a little more unclear?

308
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,103
I need a little more
context on that one.

309
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:28,991
- Jalil Ben-David, 33.

310
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,807
Son of Israeli war hero
Ayou Ben-David

311
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,527
and his Palestinian
mistress, Yanakoi Dumi.

312
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:37,153
Educated at Oxford.
Top of his class.

313
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,289
Now promoting tolerance
in the territories.

314
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,953
"Peace at Last?"

315
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:42,946
Hmm?

316
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,258
Never seen this

317
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,499
<i>on the cover of World
magazine before, have we?</i>

318
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,874
I don't know, Stef.

319
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,346
This is all seeming

320
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:52,291
a little bit too
"inside the box" for me.

321
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,012
What's your point?

322
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,964
My sources say
he commands the respect

323
00:15:56,965 --> 00:15:59,077
of both the Israelis
and Palestinians

324
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,915
and is very close
to establishing stability

325
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:15,371
without providing a solution.

326
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,290
Take him out.

327
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,891
I'm sorry?

328
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:19,850
You heard me.

329
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,300
I'm assuming you're saying
we should assassinate him.

330
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,149
Worked before
with Kennedy, Sadat...

331
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,164
I see your point. But...

332
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,020
Those things can get messy.

333
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,172
OK, Raatib.

334
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:33,581
What do you suggest?

335
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:34,829
What I always do.

336
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,766
Simplification plus automization
equals profitization.

337
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:43,022
Janet, send her in.

338
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:45,487
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I please present to you</i>

339
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:46,832
the esteemed head

340
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,198
of the neurological
research-and-development team,

341
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,799
Dr. Bella Lithia.

342
00:16:54,322 --> 00:16:56,594
This is an executive summary.

343
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,186
I expect few of you
to read it...

344
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,356
And fewer of you
to even understand it.

345
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:05,172
So let me put it
in simple terms.

346
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:07,187
As we all know, power,

347
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:08,276
real power,

348
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,491
is simply the ability

349
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,987
to make people do
what we want them to do.

350
00:17:11,988 --> 00:17:15,635
So far, there has been
3 means to assert power:

351
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,387
Manipulation, coercion...

352
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,668
Or force.

353
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,925
With Flicker Tech,
all this is obsolete.

354
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:26,228
In other words, gentlemen,

355
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,439
a totally new paradigm.

356
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,448
Our Flicker Tech field trials

357
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,178
have been
successfully completed,

358
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,250
and we are ready
to start operation

359
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,266
6 months ahead of schedule.

360
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,739
Why the delay?

361
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,244
Excuse me?

362
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:43,996
We have been told it's fully
operational right now.

363
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,181
Is that correct?

364
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,188
Yes. Yes.

365
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:49,884
Mmm.

366
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:58,687
So he goes to
Columbia Law, and....

367
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,095
He's from the neighbourhood.

368
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:01,791
Like, 2 blocks away
his entire life!

369
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,752
My, my, my...

370
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:04,258
Are you even listening to me?

371
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,082
This whack job in Connecticut,

372
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,906
some soccer mom,

373
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:09,026
no previous record,

374
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:12,132
poisons a bunch of parents
at a school meeting!

375
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,349
Nine people dead!

376
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,691
(Phone ringing)

377
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,962
I'm telling you, this world
is turning into pure crap.

378
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,116
Good morning!

379
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,332
<i>You know I'm breaking</i>

380
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,765
<i>every rule in the book
right now by calling you?</i>

381
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:23,203
Oh yeah?
What book is that?

382
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,156
The Guy's Unwritten
Playbook for Dating.

383
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,148
Rule number one:

384
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,684
<i>Never, ever call a girl</i>

385
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,828
<i>the morning
after the first date.</i>

386
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:32,198
She will think you're
pathetic, desperate

387
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,639
and a potential stalker.

388
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,259
Funny, that's what the
Girl's Playbook says, too!

389
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,283
So are you?

390
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,404
What?

391
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,037
A stalker!

392
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,125
(Laughing)

393
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:43,212
Funny!

394
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,676
<i>Funny. Uh, look,
so the point is,</i>

395
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:47,919
I had a really good time
with you last night.

396
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,119
So I'm calling because I don't
want you to get the wrong idea.

397
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,303
Wait, what?

398
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,063
<i>Well, I told
my parents last night,</i>

399
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,336
<i>I'd really buckle down
and study for midterms</i>

400
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:57,712
hard over the next few weeks.

401
00:18:57,713 --> 00:19:00,401
So I'm probably really not
gonna have much time to go out.

402
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:01,361
Go out.

403
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,027
No, I totally get it.

404
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,947
Chris, that's not a big deal.

405
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,963
<i>I mean, whatever.
We just had dinner, right?</i>

406
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,914
No, it's not OK.
It wasn't just a dinner.

407
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,772
So when are your midterms?

408
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:12,819
Ugh... A week from Friday.

409
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,780
All right.

410
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:16,244
Until then, you can
always call me.

411
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,676
(Exhaling)

412
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,182
What?

413
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:23,221
No, it's just that if I call
you, I'm gonna wanna see you.

414
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:24,406
And if I see you,

415
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,421
<i>we'll say it's gonna
be for 5 minutes,</i>

416
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,374
and it'll end up being
for, like, 5 hours.

417
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,775
- Or you could just use
some self-discipline.

418
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:33,527
If I had any, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

419
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:34,679
<i>I see your point.</i>

420
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,919
All right, so radio silence

421
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,393
until a week from tomorrow.

422
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,569
And then we pick up
where we left off.

423
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,457
OK. All right. Deal.

424
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,826
And, uh, Chris...

425
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,426
<i>Yeah?</i>

426
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:47,866
Bet you wished you kissed me

427
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,787
when you dropped me
off last night.

428
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,452
Ooh, that is cold!

429
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:53,532
Ice! You're the Ice Queen!

430
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:54,460
Bye!

431
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,579
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

432
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,540
Bye.

433
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,830
Calling you the day
after your first date.

434
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,232
Friggin' stalker...

435
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,799
(Laughing)

436
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,296
Why did you lie to them?

437
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:08,450
Do you have any idea

438
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:10,882
how much work we have
left to do before...

439
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,098
Before it's perfect?

440
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:13,505
Perfection doesn't interest me.

441
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,530
Practical results do.

442
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,937
We still need to tackle

443
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,699
a number of
significant problems

444
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,675
before we can attempt an
operation of any magnitude!

445
00:20:20,676 --> 00:20:21,635
Oh really?

446
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:22,787
Such as?

447
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,739
Override strong
personal feelings

448
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,077
between perspective subject
and target, for one.

449
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,070
Oh, details!

450
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,733
Excuses.

451
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:33,478
I have spent my entire
adult life in this technology,

452
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:37,383
and I'm not going to see it
compromised by half measures!

453
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,758
You're right.

454
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,512
We must be responsible, Bella.

455
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,096
We rise together...

456
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,532
We fall together...

457
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:50,348
But if we fall...

458
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:53,902
You fall first.

459
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,190
Oh...

460
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,664
(Knocking on door)

461
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:25,976
- Chris?
- Mmm...

462
00:21:25,977 --> 00:21:27,415
You OK?

463
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,664
(Sighing)

464
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:32,857
Yeah.

465
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,041
(Exhaling)

466
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:36,665
Lady with the gun?

467
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,058
Been a while.

468
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:43,482
Hmm?

469
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:45,467
Don't make too much of it.

470
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,163
It's just a dream.

471
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:48,795
No, you know...

472
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,292
Like, sometimes there's a word.

473
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,813
And it's right on
the tip of your tongue,

474
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,285
but you can't think of it.

475
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,614
This lady is...

476
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:02,749
It's like she's...

477
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,607
Right on the tip of my brain.

478
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,575
It's like I know her.

479
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,536
But how?

480
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,322
(Car horn honking)

481
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What did I tell you?

482
00:22:22,692 --> 00:22:24,581
I don't want this
thing in here.

483
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,885
Yeah right, like
I'm gonna leave it outside

484
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:28,004
in this neighbourhood.

485
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:29,380
It's dirty!

486
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,813
Dude, just give me a tall
Americano to go, all right?

487
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,543
- What's up?
- What's up?

488
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,295
(Sighing)

489
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:39,431
<i>♪ At the break of day
You say it, too... ♪</i>

490
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:46,571
Boo!
Ah!

491
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,874
Didn't you break
your pelvis or something?

492
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,827
I chipped it.
Hurt like hell. No biggie.

493
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,716
Not like the ribs.
But, man, though...

494
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,820
Every time I go over a pothole,
I think I'm gonna black out.

495
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,244
Oh, and thanks for not
popping by to check on me.

496
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:02,030
Yeah, thanks for telling my
dad I got busted by the cops.

497
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:03,823
Sort of slipped
past the painkillers.

498
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:06,511
Yeah, how'd that
work out, anyway?

499
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:09,456
Well, I'm under house arrest
and I got midterms.

500
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:10,447
You tell me.

501
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:11,953
I mean, with the cops.

502
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,386
Oh... Remember that paramed?

503
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,178
Yeah! The one you
was hitting on

504
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:17,938
while I was dying
on the sidewalk?

505
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:20,851
Turns out, her
dad's a detective.

506
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:22,227
Got the charges dropped.

507
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:24,436
You gotta be the luckiest
guy on the planet.

508
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,804
So then we go to dinner.

509
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,364
Oh, look at you! Player!
All 007 and stuff, eh?

510
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:32,086
Yeah. Well, turns out,
she's great.

511
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,910
Really?

512
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,214
We talked for, like, 3 hours.

513
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,350
Well, then I'm glad
I had the opportunity

514
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,791
to introduce you guys.

515
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,583
Yeah, me too.
Thanks, buddy.

516
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,574
(Laughing)

517
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:44,727
What's her name?

518
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,344
Renny.

519
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,200
Oh man...

520
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:51,480
- What?
- You're in love!

521
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:53,721
- Shut up!
- Because the way you said it...

522
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:56,408
"Renny..." I mean, it
sounded like you were in love.

523
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,393
- Well, that's her name.
- No, no, no.

524
00:23:58,394 --> 00:23:59,930
No, no, no!
I'm not saying...

525
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,435
I'm not talking about the name.

526
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:03,132
I'm saying about
the way you said it.

527
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,790
The way you said "Renny" sounded
like you were in love.

528
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,773
I don't know.
Say it again. Let's see.

529
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,374
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you guys going?

530
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,030
Manhattan. Your dad's
taking me out to dinner.

531
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,567
Ha! On a Wednesday night?

532
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:19,167
What, it's against the law

533
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,312
for us to go out
on a Wednesday night?

534
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:23,008
Your dinner's on the stove.

535
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,056
We'll bring you
back some dessert.

536
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:26,497
OK then!

537
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,745
Have fun!

538
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,377
(Engine starting)

539
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:51,972
(Chuckling)

540
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:54,853
What are you doing here?

541
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,485
It was you mom's idea.

542
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:59,558
She figured you
gotta eat, so...

543
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,254
Why not eat with a friend?

544
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,623
Huh... I can't
believe she did this.

545
00:25:03,623 --> 00:25:05,960
I can go if you
need to study or...

546
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:08,073
No... No.
Oh no, you don't.

547
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:16,847
No, did...

548
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,416
Did you make this?

549
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,873
No. Your mom did.

550
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:24,275
But I helped her
with the salad.

Do awesome on your exams.

567
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:40,368
And I'll see you Friday.

568
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,192
(Sirens blaring)

569
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:03,217
(Car engine starting)

570
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,448
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you want?

571
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:16,815
Ah! Ah!

572
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:20,911
(Screaming)

573
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,626
No! No!

574
00:27:37,627 --> 00:27:39,290
(Grunting)

575
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,988
What? What? Stop!

576
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:43,261
Where are you guys
taking me? huh?

577
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,440
What do you want?
What do you want?

578
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:46,913
Just tell me what you want!

579
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:48,514
I don't have any money!
I don't have anything!

580
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,291
Christopher Moore. Age 24.
Born October 15, 1986.

581
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,876
No! No! No,
you got the wrong guy!

582
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:58,053
I was born in July!
July 2!

583
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:58,565
My ID's in my wallet.

584
00:27:59,047 --> 00:27:59,686
Don't!

585
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:02,054
You guys are making
a huge mistake!

586
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,912
You're studying
Law at Columbia.

587
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:05,993
You reside at
20 East 25th Street.

588
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:10,186
Legal guardians: Frank Edward
and Pam Elizabeth Moore.

589
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:11,852
Legal guardians?
What do you mean?

590
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:14,414
What are you talking about?
Who are you people?

591
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:15,885
Please.

592
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,376
Please, come with me.
I'll explain.

593
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:22,322
Come. I want you
to see something.

594
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,700
Twenty years ago,

595
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:30,130
a boy was found scavenging food

596
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:31,921
from a dumpster in Chinatown.

597
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:34,897
He was placed in the custody
of Child Services.

598
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:38,767
It was later determined,
he had suffered a concussion.

599
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:41,008
He had no memory
of his parents,

600
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:42,481
where he came from.

601
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,433
Even his name was a mystery.

602
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:55,376
That child was subsequently
adopted by Frank and Pam Moore.

603
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:57,360
So you're saying this kid...

604
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,705
Was you.

605
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:00,145
Yes.

606
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:01,618
(Scoffing)

607
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:06,131
No, you know what?
This is ridiculous.

608
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,499
Ten days ago,
when you were arrested,

609
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,932
the police collected
a routine DNA swab.

610
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,852
They entered it into CODIS.

611
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:15,797
This generated a match
to your biological parents.

612
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:20,439
I assure you, the results
were checked and rechecked.

613
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,912
They're irrefutable.

614
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,658
Your birth name...

615
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,161
Is Kit Walker.

616
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:29,306
(Accent):
Kit Walker.

617
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:32,028
You were born in
Gstaad, Switzerland,

618
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,917
and named after your father...

619
00:29:35,134 --> 00:29:37,022
Who was a very important man.

620
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,750
- Was?
- Yes.

621
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:41,698
He died 22 years ago.

622
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:44,836
Cancer.

623
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:52,838
(Laughing)

624
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,991
OK...

625
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,289
OK! So what you're
saying is, I'm not me.

626
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,489
My parents aren't my parents.

627
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,506
And my real father is dead.

628
00:30:04,908 --> 00:30:06,861
I know this is difficult.

629
00:30:06,862 --> 00:30:08,845
No, no, no, this
is not difficult.

630
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:09,806
This is insane.

631
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,750
I don't even know
who you people are!

632
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:15,660
Fair enough.

633
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:20,236
We represent an agency
known as Bpaa-Thap.

634
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:21,260
- Ba-what?

635
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:25,036
In 1664, one of your ancestors,

636
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:27,789
and a former pirate,
named Barbrouge...

637
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,102
Wait, I'm sorry.

638
00:30:29,103 --> 00:30:30,063
A pirate?

639
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,342
(Laughing)

640
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:32,496
A former pirate.

641
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:35,216
Established a small
paramilitary group

642
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:37,616
whose mandate was
to protect the innocent

643
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,537
against violence
and oppression.

644
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,170
Since then, it has grown into

645
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:43,185
an international
covert intelligence

646
00:30:43,186 --> 00:30:45,169
and law-enforcement agency,

647
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,609
located in Bengalla.

648
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,755
- Ah! Bengalla?
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:51,834
A small island nation in
the Indonesian archipelago.

650
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:53,275
Oh, I know where it is.

651
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,987
My name is Abel Vandermaark.

652
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,877
Director of Field Operations.

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,185
Well...

654
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:03,809
Abel...

655
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,852
I'd really love to hear
about this sometime.

656
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:09,733
But I got things to do.

657
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:14,118
Wait! Would you like
to see your real mother?

658
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:20,841
Diana Walker.

659
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,430
(Exhaling)

660
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,215
You remember her.

661
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:57,487
She's...

662
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:58,543
Dead.

663
00:31:58,544 --> 00:31:59,888
Yes.

664
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:03,633
You were with her in the car
when it was forced off the road.

665
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,023
You recognize this place?

666
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:23,995
No.

667
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,862
I know who I am.

668
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,047
I'm Chris--

669
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,898
- You are Kit Walker.
Your mother was murdered.

670
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:35,171
Her assassins are still alive.

671
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:36,196
Still at-large.

672
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:37,511
What do you want?

673
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:40,072
The world needs you...

674
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:43,559
To assume the mantle
of your forefathers

675
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,379
and take up their
struggle against...

676
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,627
Against what?

677
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,034
Evil.

678
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,206
It's so pervasive...

679
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,408
We don't even see it anymore.

680
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:01,938
My family...

681
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:06,291
Has been in the service
of yours for 5 generations.

682
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,932
(Sirens in distance)

683
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:15,991
If you want to know more
about your real family,

684
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:18,391
you can reach me at that
number 24 hours a day.

685
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:21,624
I'll be staying at the Ritz
Central Park until Friday.

686
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,706
I already have a real...

687
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:30,011
Family.

688
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,907
Do you think it was
wise to let him go

689
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:46,500
before convincing
him to join us?

690
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,700
He'll call.

691
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,332
He's a Walker.

692
00:33:57,224 --> 00:33:58,599
Mom!

693
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,912
Dad!

694
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,385
(Breathing heavily)

695
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:12,558
Mom?

696
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,022
Dad?

697
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,146
Mom?

698
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:40,659
Dad!

699
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,971
Guys!

700
00:35:07,255 --> 00:35:08,501
(Breathing heavily)

701
00:35:16,545 --> 00:35:18,337
(Coughing)

702
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:20,897
Oh! Oh God!

703
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,490
(Breathing heavily)

704
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,361
No.

705
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,765
Ah!

706
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:05,775
(Grunting)

707
00:36:29,177 --> 00:36:31,000
(Grunting)

708
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,337
(Car alarm blaring)

709
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:45,595
Ah!

710
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,511
Walker!

711
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:01,935
Where are you going to go, huh?

712
00:38:01,936 --> 00:38:03,248
(Laughing)

713
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:10,321
OK.

714
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:12,593
Ah!

715
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,817
(Laughing)

716
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:19,985
It's too bad
I have to kill you!

717
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:22,290
You are pretty good, my friend!

718
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:25,044
(Panting)

719
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:27,928
(Grunting)

720
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:30,969
(Metal piercing flesh
and groaning)

721
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,139
Jeannot!

722
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,620
Jeannot!

723
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,864
(Panting)

724
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:03,657
(Panting)

725
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,730
Walker!

726
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,297
<i>Tu es Mort!</i>

727
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,817
You hear me?
You're dead!

728
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,706
Dead!

729
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,232
(Clattering)

730
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,127
Show yourself or I'll shoot.

731
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,777
Why'd you kill them?
You psycho!

732
00:40:09,778 --> 00:40:11,922
What are you talking about?

733
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:13,971
- My parents are dead!
- The Moores?

734
00:40:13,972 --> 00:40:16,467
Two men were waiting
for me when I got home.

735
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:17,938
They tried to kill me.

736
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:18,899
(Panting)

737
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,467
Listen to me.

738
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:21,781
Listen to me!

739
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:23,187
Listen to me!

740
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:24,661
Now, you think.

741
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:28,437
If we wanted you dead, then we
could easily have killed you

742
00:40:28,438 --> 00:40:29,909
after we picked you up, right?

743
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,477
RIGHT?

744
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:33,206
(Panting)

745
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:40,214
What happened?

746
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:42,358
I went straight home.

747
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,911
I wanted to hear it from them.

748
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,416
What we talked about earlier?

749
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,536
(Clattering)

750
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:50,105
Two men...

751
00:40:50,106 --> 00:40:52,473
Were waiting f me.

752
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,218
Parkour traceurs.
Good ones.

753
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,723
(Panting)

754
00:40:57,724 --> 00:40:59,484
French, I think.

755
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:00,444
Twins?

756
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:01,405
Yeah.

757
00:41:02,398 --> 00:41:03,837
They might've been.

758
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,150
The Roux brothers.

759
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:08,352
Singh Assassins.
Top shelf.

760
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,338
Guran, we've been made.

761
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,427
(Groaning)

762
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:17,348
Send our bodyguard
down for the car.

763
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,239
Meet us outside the lobby.

764
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,064
Yes, he's here with me.

765
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,097
Did you call the police?

766
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:27,146
No, I lost my phone.

767
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,715
Then it's good you came here.

768
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:31,851
The police are not equipped
to protect you from the Singhs.

769
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:32,971
The who?

770
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:34,476
The Singh Brotherhood.

771
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:36,525
They're an international
crime syndicate.

772
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:37,645
(Sighing)

773
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:39,375
How come I've never
heard of them?

774
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:42,064
Because they're very
good at what they do.

775
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:44,817
Time to check out.

776
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:48,660
Why, you think he'll come here?

777
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:52,055
They know about you.

778
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:54,518
There's an excellent chance
they know about us.

779
00:41:55,737 --> 00:41:58,233
I thought you said
there were two of them.

780
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:00,666
One of them is dead.

781
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:04,061
It was an accident.

782
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:05,662
I just...

783
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,414
Made it happen.

784
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,824
(Elevator bell ringing)

785
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:21,536
It's clear.

786
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,641
One o'clock.

787
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:30,401
(Kit): That's him.

788
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:32,737
Which one? I can't
even tell them apart.

789
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:34,274
Shouldn't be a problem anymore.

790
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:35,809
Kit took one of them out.

791
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,995
Really?

792
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,162
Where are we going?

793
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:05,540
That's entirely up to you.

794
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,158
I'm sorry it has
to be like this.

795
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,391
I'm sorry about the Moores.

796
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:13,353
(Sighing)

797
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:14,665
But my offer still stands.

798
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,397
You can come with
us to Bengalla--

799
00:43:16,398 --> 00:43:18,638
- Fantasy Island.
I don't think so.

800
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,398
You listen to me!

801
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:22,319
These people want you dead.

802
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,015
They're relentless.

803
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:26,002
They'll kill anyone
who stands in the way.

804
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,601
The Moores were just the first.

805
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:30,162
- This can't be happening.
- It is happening!

806
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:31,890
What about witness protection?

807
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:34,163
The Singhs have infiltrated
every intelligence

808
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:36,277
and law-enforcement agency
on the planet.

809
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:38,006
It may take them time,

810
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:39,830
but they will find you.

811
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:42,838
So what? You're telling me
that my only chance is with you?

812
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,279
It would appear so.

813
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,554
But before you
make your decision,

814
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:48,729
know this:

815
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,234
Once you chose,

816
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:51,483
there'll be no going back.

817
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:52,667
You'll have to walk away

818
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,069
from everyone and everything
you've ever known.

819
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,342
For all intents and purposes,

820
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,353
Chris Moore will simply
cease to exist.

821
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:03,650
No farewells, no apologies,
no explanations.

822
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:06,436
Now you're on
the Singhs' radar.

823
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,453
To contact anyone
would be tantamount

824
00:44:08,454 --> 00:44:09,893
to giving them
a death sentence.

825
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,581
- But if I just
disappear, wh--

826
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:14,983
- I know, they'll be
worried and hurt.

827
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,479
Better that than dead.

828
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:21,382
How far out are we?

829
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:24,103
The jets are warming up.
We've got 5 minutes.

830
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,193
I need a decision.

831
00:44:29,194 --> 00:44:32,104
You're just asking me
to give up everything.

832
00:44:33,643 --> 00:44:35,274
My life, my name...

833
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:37,451
My whole world.

834
00:44:37,452 --> 00:44:39,019
Just like--

835
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,010
Just like that.

836
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,739
Look inside yourself, boy.

837
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,684
You know this was
never your world.

838
00:44:47,403 --> 00:44:49,321
You've always known it.

839
00:44:57,643 --> 00:44:59,914
(Sighing)

840
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,162
OK.

841
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:03,275
Let's go.

842
00:45:23,861 --> 00:45:26,580
<i>(Man): You've arrived safely
with our young friend.</i>

843
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,757
Kit, this is
Dr. Deepak Baboor,

844
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,517
the director
of Bpaa-Thap.

845
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:33,304
<i>It's a great honour</i>

846
00:45:33,305 --> 00:45:35,256
<i>to finally meet
the 22nd Phantom.</i>

847
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,440
- It's, um--

848
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,000
<i>- We've prepared
a reception at my lab.</i>

849
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,458
<i>You may meet me and my
sub-directors for tea and cakes,</i>

850
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:45,690
<i>followed by a most excellent
tour of our facilities.</i>

851
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,322
It won't be necessary.

852
00:45:47,323 --> 00:45:49,498
Mr. Walker has had
a long flight.

853
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,091
There'll be plenty of time later
to meet your people.

854
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:54,108
<i>- B-b-but we've gone through--</i>

855
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,644
- Whoa, that was kind of harsh!

856
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:57,502
Trust me.
You'll thank me later.

857
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:00,482
Baboor's a scientist.

858
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:02,660
A big believer in technology:

859
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:05,221
Electronics, surveillance,
intelligence gathering,

860
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:07,878
cooperation with
local law-enforcement.

861
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:08,902
So?

862
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:10,823
So since your father died,

863
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:13,224
that's where he's directed
most of our operations.

864
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:16,201
And that's a bad thing?

865
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:19,306
If it's at the expense
of Field Division, yes.

866
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:20,779
And that's your thing.

867
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,741
Yes.

868
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:23,661
Your father's thing.

869
00:46:23,662 --> 00:46:25,324
And your grandfather's thing.

870
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,508
And so on and so on.

871
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:29,421
There's something
you guys aren't telling me.

872
00:46:29,422 --> 00:46:32,398
Over the last few years,
there've been a number of...

873
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:33,615
Irregularities.

874
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:34,702
Security breaches.

875
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:36,656
It's possible the Brotherhood

876
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:38,383
was tipped off
to your location.

877
00:46:38,384 --> 00:46:40,209
By someone here.

878
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,426
Keep your eyes open.

879
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:44,210
Be very careful
about what you say,

880
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:46,450
especially around
Baboor's people.

881
00:46:48,244 --> 00:46:50,165
What was that he called me?

882
00:46:50,166 --> 00:46:51,766
The Phantom?

883
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,038
It's a title of sorts.

884
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:55,766
One that must be earned.

885
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,610
End of the road.

886
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,698
Hop out.

887
00:47:04,699 --> 00:47:06,683
Where to?

888
00:47:06,684 --> 00:47:09,243
Wherever they
decide to take you.

889
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:10,429
Who?

890
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,956
(Girl speaking
foreign language)

891
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:14,559
(Birds chirping)

892
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,287
What are they saying?

893
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:18,880
<i>Lukaisa means
"The ghost who walks."</i>

894
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:20,353
It's a holy name

895
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:23,649
by which my people have known
your family for generations.

896
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,409
Where are they gonna take me?

897
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:28,865
Home.

898
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:36,100
<i>The Phantom has been</i>

899
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,919
<i>the protector of my people
for generations.</i>

900
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,232
<i>Trust them,</i>

901
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,736
<i>As with your father
before you,</i>

902
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,938
<i>they will guide you
to fulfill your destiny.</i>

903
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:52,172
(Boys speaking
foreign language)

904
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:05,234
(Birds chirping,
insects buzzing)

905
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,984
(Birds chirping)

906
00:50:53,057 --> 00:50:54,624
Winston Churchill.

907
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:58,850
Your great-great-grandfather
and he were thick as thieves.

908
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,163
(Chuckling)

909
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:07,685
The Rat Pack.

910
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:08,646
- Mm-hmm.

911
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:10,628
Your father helped
Mr. Sinatra

912
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:11,653
recover his son

913
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:13,508
after he was
abducted for ransom.

914
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:15,172
Is that my dad right there?

915
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:16,420
- Mm-hmm.

916
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,953
The one in the mask?

917
00:51:17,954 --> 00:51:19,265
The Phantom.

918
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:23,587
But he's in all these pictures,

919
00:51:23,588 --> 00:51:25,571
going back, what,
at least 100 years?

920
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:26,915
Oh, much more than that.

921
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:29,730
1536, to be exact.

922
00:51:29,731 --> 00:51:31,747
- But how could
he possibly be--

923
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:35,202
- In every case, the man behind
the mask is named Kit Walker.

924
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:37,412
And so it is passed
from father to son

925
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:38,947
for 21 generations.

926
00:51:38,948 --> 00:51:41,957
Preserving the
illusion of immortality.

927
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,909
The ghost who walks.

928
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,757
It took over 4 centuries
for the Singh Brotherhood

929
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:48,134
to discover the truth:

930
00:51:48,135 --> 00:51:50,055
That the only way
to kill the Phantom

931
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:52,072
was to destroy
the Walker family line.

932
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,327
What's that?

933
00:51:57,641 --> 00:52:00,297
One of Baboor's
recent additions.

934
00:52:01,995 --> 00:52:05,290
Bpaa-Thap's network links with
every major law-enforcement,

935
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:08,393
mass-media and intelligence
agency in the world.

936
00:52:08,394 --> 00:52:09,833
(Beeping)

937
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:12,170
Instructions and passwords
are in the drawer.

938
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:15,370
Lab, medical facilities,
gym, motor pool are below us.

939
00:52:15,371 --> 00:52:17,706
Guran will show you
how to get there.

940
00:52:17,707 --> 00:52:19,978
Meals are served
in the cafeteria,

941
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,835
but if you prefer to eat in,

942
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:23,434
you just call the kitchen.

943
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:26,604
Room service.

944
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:27,692
- Mm-hmm.

945
00:52:29,294 --> 00:52:30,253
Wow! So, wait.

946
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:31,725
So all this is just--

947
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:33,294
- Yours.

948
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,726
It's your ancestral home.

949
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:36,848
(Chuckling)

950
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,383
My ancestral home.

951
00:52:38,384 --> 00:52:40,657
Once you take the oath
of your forefathers

952
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,033
and complete your training,

953
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:45,359
you will be rewarded
the privilege of wearing this.

954
00:52:54,419 --> 00:52:56,083
You're kidding, right?

955
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:57,074
I know.

956
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:58,867
It's a daunting challenge.

957
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,970
We'll do everything we can

958
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:05,428
to help you assume your
legacy as the 22nd Phantom.

959
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,942
But I didn't agree
to take any sacred oaths

960
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:12,246
or go through any
training programs.

961
00:53:12,246 --> 00:53:14,710
The only reason I came
here with you people

962
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:16,245
was to protect my friends.

963
00:53:16,246 --> 00:53:17,590
I see.

964
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:20,952
I don't know what you expected.

965
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:25,751
The journals of your
21 predecessors

966
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:27,384
are collected in the library.

967
00:53:28,409 --> 00:53:30,201
If you're at all interested.

968
00:53:34,266 --> 00:53:35,610
Uh...

969
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:37,500
I'm sorry.

970
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:40,478
I told him not to make
any assumptions.

971
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:42,047
I'm not wearing that.

972
00:53:43,614 --> 00:53:44,702
Ah!

973
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:48,127
With Flicker, the sky
is the limit, gentlemen.

974
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:49,599
The sky is the limit.

975
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,584
True, the results
are impressive.

976
00:53:51,585 --> 00:53:54,272
But the subject's behaviour,
so unnatural.

977
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,839
Let's be fair there.

978
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,088
Doug, come on.

979
00:53:57,089 --> 00:53:58,529
This is just a beta, right?

980
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,536
Once Lithia has worked out
and shaken loose all the bugs,

981
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,200
I assure you we will literally

982
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:06,337
be able to program anyone
we want to do whatever we want.

983
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:08,994
As crude as it is, even the
beta version has its uses:

984
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,562
Contract killings,
assassinations,

985
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:12,098
suicide bombings.

986
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:13,346
Still, it's expensive.

987
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:15,426
Oh really? And the
old way isn't?

988
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:16,772
Is that what you're saying?

989
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:19,172
Case in point: this bloody
Morpheus goes 7 figures

990
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,275
for overhead expenses, contract
services, evidence clean-up.

991
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:25,766
And all because McDowell had
a little bug up his butt

992
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:28,454
about Flicker's reliability.

993
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:30,088
And how reliable
is B.A.U?

994
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:33,064
One dead operative,
and the target's still alive.

995
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:35,945
Just let me do my job,

996
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:37,002
and I promise you:

997
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:38,923
I will vaporize

998
00:54:38,924 --> 00:54:40,427
this Kit Walker.

999
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:41,835
It's just a matter of time.

1000
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:44,844
Phantom number 22

1001
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:48,558
will have very,
very short lifespan.

1002
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,999
Such p

1003
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,345
(All shouting)

1004
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:54,195
And you realize this headache
could've all been avoided

1005
00:54:54,196 --> 00:54:55,892
if we had simply
deployed Flicker.

1006
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:57,589
Oh! Peter, what's
that word again?

1007
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,701
- Fore.
- Right. Fore!

1008
00:54:59,702 --> 00:55:01,109
(Shouting)

1009
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,774
Hello.

1010
00:55:02,775 --> 00:55:04,440
All right, then.

1011
00:55:06,234 --> 00:55:08,794
Gentlemen, why don't
you play through?

1012
00:55:08,795 --> 00:55:10,139
I'll catch up.

1013
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:32,190
So you had some
problems in New York.

1014
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:34,240
<i>Oui.</i>

1015
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:36,575
- That's usually
my favourite word, but--

1016
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:37,631
- I will find him.

1017
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:39,584
No.

1018
00:55:39,585 --> 00:55:41,760
No, I don't think so,
my friend.

1019
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:43,393
- But Mr. McDowell--

1020
00:55:43,394 --> 00:55:44,674
- He's a bloody troglodyte

1021
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,627
that still believes
in ghost stories.

1022
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:47,553
No, I'm sorry.

1023
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:49,155
We're cutting
our losses, Jacquot.

1024
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:51,906
I can't see blowing anymore
dough on yesterday's game.

1025
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,603
But this bastard
killed my brother!

1026
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:56,676
(Groaning)

1027
00:55:56,677 --> 00:55:57,924
I am your brother!

1028
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:00,133
You understand?

1029
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,238
Seeking out
of personal vendettas...

1030
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,486
(Clicking tongue)

1031
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,278
Clean yourself up.

1032
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,792
Are you gonna eat
that last shrimp?

1033
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:15,879
No, go ahead.

1034
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:24,267
How'd you know
I liked Chinese food?

1035
00:56:25,484 --> 00:56:26,923
I am Guran.

1036
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:31,116
Guran knows all that the
Phantom requires at all times.

1037
00:56:35,087 --> 00:56:37,934
Truth is, we surveyed
your place for about a week

1038
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,174
and found the containers
in the trash.

1039
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:49,329
Everything I had,

1040
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:52,369
everything I thought I had,

1041
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,650
was a lie.

1042
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,339
Everything?

1043
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,084
Maybe not everything.

1044
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:02,069
Renny Davidson?

1045
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:06,551
I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

1046
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,087
No, you're right.
It's not.

1047
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:09,431
And she wasn't.

1048
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,057
Wasn't...

1049
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:14,777
Wasn't a lie.

1050
00:57:15,737 --> 00:57:17,176
She was real.

1051
00:57:17,177 --> 00:57:18,841
(Chuckling)

1052
00:57:18,842 --> 00:57:20,218
Unlike Chris Moore.

1053
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:24,092
I feel like such an idiot.

1054
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:25,821
There's no way
you could've known.

1055
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:26,940
No, but that's just it.

1056
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:27,900
I did know.

1057
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:31,391
At least a part of me did.

1058
00:57:31,392 --> 00:57:35,583
I used to have dreams
for years about this lady.

1059
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:37,984
My real mom.

1060
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:40,258
And I had dreams about
places I've never been.

1061
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,338
This place.

1062
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:44,995
Did you tell your parents?

1063
00:57:44,996 --> 00:57:46,468
Yeah!
About a million times

1064
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:48,868
they had a chance
to tell me the truth,

1065
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,405
and they didn't.

1066
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,053
Maybe they loved you too much

1067
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,622
to see you get hurt.

1068
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,528
You're probably right.

1069
00:58:00,746 --> 00:58:02,953
But I just wished
that I had a chance to...

1070
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,482
To talk to them.

1071
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:06,826
I'm sorry.

1072
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:08,811
They were good people.

1073
00:58:09,804 --> 00:58:11,148
I don't know.

1074
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:13,004
It--it just shouldn't
have happened.

1075
00:58:13,005 --> 00:58:14,381
No.

1076
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:16,013
But it did.

1077
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:19,183
And somewhere it's happening
to someone else right now.

1078
00:58:21,808 --> 00:58:23,023
(Sighing)

1079
00:58:23,024 --> 00:58:24,401
How do you stop it?

1080
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,120
You can't.

1081
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:31,892
But if I were you,

1082
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:35,187
I'd read your
father's journals.

1083
00:58:42,104 --> 00:58:43,672
Thanks for dinner.

1084
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:49,338
(Insects chirping)

1085
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:18,778
<i>(Man): I was born in the year
1516 in the city of Portsmouth</i>

1086
01:00:18,779 --> 01:00:20,698
<i>of a seafaring family.</i>

1087
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:23,544
My father was the captain
of a mercantile vessel,

1088
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:24,760
The Mary Elwyn,

1089
01:00:24,761 --> 01:00:27,385
<i>upon which I was employed
as a cabin boy</i>

1090
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:30,330
<i>on a voyage to
the South China Sea.</i>

1091
01:00:30,331 --> 01:00:33,915
On the 17th day of February,
the year of our Lord 1536,

1092
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:37,084
we were set upon by pirates
of the Singh Brotherhood.

1093
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:38,941
(Swords clanking
and men screaming)

1094
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:40,319
All hands were slaughtered.

1095
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,400
Not a single life spared,

1096
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:44,064
<i>except for my own.</i>

1097
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:46,530
<i>In the thick of battle,</i>

1098
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:47,875
<i>I was thrown overboard.</i>

1099
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:52,645
<i>When I awoke, it was broad day
and the weather clear.</i>

1100
01:00:52,646 --> 01:00:55,305
<i>I was on the sandy shore
of an island</i>

1101
01:00:55,305 --> 01:00:57,289
where I saw another seaman,

1102
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,369
still not 30 paces from me.

1103
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,538
<i>As I approached,
I saw that he did not stir,</i>

1104
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:04,651
<i>and he was likely dead.</i>

1105
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:07,757
<i>It was only when
I finally beheld his face</i>

1106
01:01:07,758 --> 01:01:09,709
<i>that the true horror
was revealed.</i>

1107
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,822
<i>I recognized
the terrible countenance</i>

1108
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:12,974
<i>of my own dear father.</i>

1109
01:01:12,975 --> 01:01:15,313
<i>I built a funeral pyre</i>

1110
01:01:15,314 --> 01:01:17,616
<i>and laid my father's
remains upon it.</i>

1111
01:01:17,617 --> 01:01:20,178
<i>I watched as he was
consumed by the flames.</i>

1112
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:23,220
<i>Later I encountered
a native tribe</i>

1113
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:26,068
<i>who initiated me
into their ways.</i>

1114
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:29,301
<i>They would help me
fulfill my destiny.</i>

1115
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:31,735
<i>For it was then that
I swore to devote my life</i>

1116
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:34,901
<i>to the destruction
of piracy,</i>

1117
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:37,013
<i>greed, cruelty
and injustice</i>

1118
01:01:37,014 --> 01:01:38,486
<i>in all their forms.</i>

1119
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,885
<i>And my sons
and their sons</i>

1120
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:42,101
<i>shall follow me.</i>

1121
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:06,030
(Man on TV):
Despite security concerns,

1122
01:02:06,031 --> 01:02:08,591
<i>Israeli peace activist
Jalil Ben-David</i>

1123
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,512
<i>will be visiting
the United States.</i>

1124
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:11,764
I know, I know!

1125
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:12,757
<i>A spokesman confirmed</i>

1126
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:15,798
that Ben-David will play a key
role at the Mideast Peace Summit

1127
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,590
<i>to be held on the 20th
of September at midnight.</i>

1128
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:20,309
The date is significant
for both Jews and Muslims

1129
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,965
<i>as it falls between
the last day of Rosh Hashanah</i>

1130
01:02:22,966 --> 01:02:25,778
and the first day of the
Muslim celebration of Ramadan.

1131
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:27,218
(Turns TV off)

1132
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:28,978
You OK?

1133
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,507
People don't just fall
off the face of the universe.

1134
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:33,426
Yeah, baby, they do.

1135
01:02:33,427 --> 01:02:34,931
Every day.

1136
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,003
Whole families?

1137
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,914
Stuff happens, huh?
Opportunities come up.

1138
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:42,547
Maybe he got a job offer.

1139
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:45,011
No, he was half a semester
from graduating!

1140
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:48,148
Even if his parents got a job,
he's not just gonna leave.

1141
01:02:48,149 --> 01:02:50,422
Maybe he wasn't doing
so good in school.

1142
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:52,089
He might've lost
his scholarship.

1143
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:53,721
No!

1144
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:56,154
Ren, I told you time and again.

1145
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:58,266
It's not police business.

1146
01:02:58,267 --> 01:03:00,154
And Jersey's not
in my jurisdiction,

1147
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,307
all right?

1148
01:03:01,308 --> 01:03:03,387
Yeah, but can't you just
make an exception?

1149
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,346
No! He'll call.

1150
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,338
Or he'll turn up.

1151
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:06,426
And when he does,

1152
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:08,347
I'm gonna kick
his sorry ass till Monday

1153
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:09,883
for putting you through this.

1154
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:10,876
Call?

1155
01:03:10,877 --> 01:03:12,444
Dad, I found his cell phone

1156
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:13,501
on the sidewalk!

1157
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:15,261
Don't you think
that's kind of weird?

1158
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,413
(Sighing)

1159
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,293
He was walking along,
head in the clouds...

1160
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,398
Dreaming about you and...

1161
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,413
And then he dropped his phone.

1162
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,430
And nobody called
his cell phone.

1163
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:28,639
He never wanted to
figure out where it was.

1164
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,239
He's just gone.

1165
01:03:31,201 --> 01:03:32,896
(Toaster popping)

1166
01:03:32,897 --> 01:03:34,976
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

1167
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:37,695
All right.

1168
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,168
I'll see what I can do.

1169
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,889
Really?

1170
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:45,220
Yeah, really.

1171
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:48,101
Oh! Here we go.

1172
01:03:48,102 --> 01:03:49,573
Thanks, Dad.

1173
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:19,052
(Sighing)

1174
01:04:20,429 --> 01:04:22,027
I changed my mind.

1175
01:04:27,277 --> 01:04:29,454
What do you know
about firearms?

1176
01:04:31,726 --> 01:04:34,062
(Sighing)

1177
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:37,455
These belonged to your father.

1178
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,728
Colt 1911s.

1179
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:43,187
Custom modified to
chamber a .451 magnum

1180
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:45,650
rather than
the standard .45 ACP.

1181
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:48,501
The only downside
is reduced capacity.

1182
01:04:48,502 --> 01:04:50,641
Six in the magazine
and one in the chamber.

1183
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:54,578
Which is why the Phantom
always carries 2.

1184
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,899
I've always liked
your father's guns.

1185
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,291
But we had to upgrade
our arsenal.

1186
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:03,604
I guess I'm a nostalgic.

1187
01:05:07,704 --> 01:05:09,014
Wow, that's heavy.

1188
01:05:09,015 --> 01:05:10,006
Your turn.

1189
01:05:14,999 --> 01:05:17,016
My father died
in August, right?

1190
01:05:17,017 --> 01:05:18,392
August 7.

1191
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:20,632
His last journal
entry ends in June.

1192
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:22,360
Well, he was pretty
sick by then.

1193
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:23,673
He must've stopped writing.

1194
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,017
No, I don't think so.

1195
01:05:25,018 --> 01:05:27,419
I mean, he filled it up
to the last page.

1196
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,537
If he just stopped,

1197
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:31,163
you'd think he'd would've
stopped in the middle.

1198
01:05:31,164 --> 01:05:34,010
If your father had one flaw,

1199
01:05:35,485 --> 01:05:36,443
it was vanity.

1200
01:05:37,884 --> 01:05:40,508
Towards the end
it wasn't pretty.

1201
01:05:40,509 --> 01:05:42,939
He couldn't even take
care of his basic needs.

1202
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,276
He was angry.

1203
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:48,764
There was fear,
rage, humiliation,

1204
01:05:48,765 --> 01:05:50,044
self-loathing.

1205
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:52,379
Things he probably
felt ashamed of.

1206
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:55,388
You think he destroyed it.

1207
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:56,797
Wouldn't you?

1208
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:01,404
(Sighing)

1209
01:06:02,397 --> 01:06:03,387
Ready?

1210
01:06:04,638 --> 01:06:06,592
The Phantom never
shoots to kill.

1211
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:09,120
The bulls eyes
mark target areas

1212
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:11,392
to disarm or incapacitate.

1213
01:06:11,393 --> 01:06:15,172
Now, assuming your adversary
is wearing a ballistic vest,

1214
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:18,503
the shaded portion at
centre mass is also nonlethal.

1215
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,057
Knees and elbows bent.

1216
01:06:23,017 --> 01:06:24,073
Relaxed.

1217
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:25,995
Weight slightly forward,

1218
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:27,499
Two hands on the grip.

1219
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,028
Eyes level
with the target and...

1220
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:35,470
Safety off.

1221
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:36,527
(Gun clicks)

1222
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:41,169
Relax, weight forward.

1223
01:06:42,129 --> 01:06:44,082
Can I just shoot?

1224
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,483
I don't know.
Can you?

1225
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,573
(Sighing)

1226
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:58,230
Again, but this time
don't shut your eyes!

1227
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:59,734
I didn't shut my eyes.

1228
01:06:59,735 --> 01:07:00,824
Yes, you did.
Again.

1229
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:07,867
Don't worry about it.

1230
01:07:07,868 --> 01:07:09,339
It's just gonna take time.

1231
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,747
This isn't working.

1232
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:12,858
- The gun's fine.
I just inspect--

1233
01:07:12,859 --> 01:07:14,139
- No, no.
Not the gun.

1234
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,835
This whole stance thing,
you know?

1235
01:07:15,836 --> 01:07:17,051
Let me deal with this

1236
01:07:17,052 --> 01:07:18,141
- One good way--

1237
01:07:18,142 --> 01:07:20,029
- No, just--
Please.

1238
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,501
No more talking.

1239
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:29,633
Think you can do that again?

1240
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:31,361
(Gun clicking)

1241
01:07:33,155 --> 01:07:34,563
Did I break it?

1242
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:37,124
No, that just means
it's out of ammunition.

1243
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:38,596
So?

1244
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,004
Get some more.

1245
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:45,095
(Exhaling)

1246
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:48,169
They're strong in you...

1247
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:51,146
The drums of your fathers.

1248
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:58,188
Take it down another 3 degrees.

1249
01:07:58,189 --> 01:07:59,629
(Heavy breathing)

1250
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,735
- (Female voice):
Temperature is now minus-5°F.

1251
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,929
All right, he's had enough.

1252
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:11,954
Let's warm him up.

1253
01:08:13,202 --> 01:08:17,011
What the hell did you
guys do when I wasn't here?

1254
01:08:17,012 --> 01:08:18,996
In what year did the
the Phantom strike

1255
01:08:18,997 --> 01:08:20,788
in the following
countries or cities?

1256
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:22,101
Cairo.
I don't know.

1257
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,476
- Corsica.
- 1960.

1258
01:08:23,477 --> 01:08:25,334
- Madagascar.
- I don't know!

1259
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,393
(Man): Come on! Go!

1260
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:41,278
Move it!
Across the stream!

1261
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,590
The Singh Brotherhood:

1262
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,605
Describe its current
infrastructure.

1263
01:08:44,606 --> 01:08:47,776
The Brotherhood is an
international crime syndicate

1264
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:50,688
<i>engaging in
drug distribution,</i>

1265
01:08:50,689 --> 01:08:52,929
money laundering and extortion.

1266
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,433
Kidnapping and prostitution.

1267
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:56,546
<i>I'm sorry. I'm a little
distracted here.</i>

1268
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:58,050
Focus. They're catching up.

1269
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,420
Trail! Trail the trail!

1270
01:09:00,421 --> 01:09:02,180
- I still got
a 100-yard lead.

1271
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,485
Sure you do.

1272
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:05,445
Come on!

1273
01:09:05,446 --> 01:09:06,500
(Grunting)

1274
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,197
Release the dogs.

1275
01:09:08,198 --> 01:09:09,992
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

1276
01:09:09,993 --> 01:09:11,656
Legitimate operations.

1277
01:09:11,657 --> 01:09:13,543
Mostly arms trading.

1278
01:09:13,544 --> 01:09:15,272
<i>Private and
paramilitary security.</i>

1279
01:09:15,273 --> 01:09:17,834
Uh, what's your timeframe
to add the night vision?

1280
01:09:21,004 --> 01:09:22,189
Soon. Within the week.

1281
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,270
<i>Their main corporate front</i>

1282
01:09:24,271 --> 01:09:26,478
is Singh Tactical Research.

1283
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,598
You're toast.

1284
01:09:27,599 --> 01:09:29,999
Their main sphere
of influence is...

1285
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,873
(Barking)

1286
01:09:33,873 --> 01:09:37,714
...Southeast Asia, the Middle
East and the Mediterranean.

1287
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,507
You forgot Eastern Europe.

1288
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,995
Well, sorry, Vandy, but it's
a little tough to multitask

1289
01:09:42,996 --> 01:09:44,692
when there's dogs
chasing after you.

1290
01:09:44,693 --> 01:09:46,166
<i>The point
of this exercise:</i>

1291
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:48,887
You need to maintain clear
tactical thinking under stress.

1292
01:09:48,888 --> 01:09:50,646
And don't call me Vandy.

1293
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:52,215
They got him!
They go him!

1294
01:09:52,216 --> 01:09:54,488
Go! Go!

1295
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:56,217
(Grunting)

1296
01:09:59,582 --> 01:10:02,302
How's your
head functioning, Kit?

1297
01:10:02,302 --> 01:10:04,574
<i>Still a little
tough to focus.</i>

1298
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,782
- I don't want him
over-reliant on technology.

1299
01:10:09,056 --> 01:10:11,808
It's not wrong to rely on
something that's reliable.

1300
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:14,335
- It needs to be tested.
- That's what we're doing.

1301
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:17,056
(Beeping)

1302
01:10:17,056 --> 01:10:18,144
(Barking)

1303
01:10:20,322 --> 01:10:21,826
Come here.

1304
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:23,361
Come here, boy.

1305
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:24,898
Damn it!

1306
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,490
Ah, good boy!

1307
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:29,283
(Laughing)

1308
01:10:29,284 --> 01:10:30,307
Good boy.

1309
01:10:30,308 --> 01:10:31,363
Come here!

1310
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:33,570
This is a waste of time.

1311
01:10:33,571 --> 01:10:35,747
Get him back to Bengalla.

1312
01:10:35,747 --> 01:10:37,604
<i>You live it!
Food! You hungry?</i>

1313
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:45,753
The things we do for love, huh?

1314
01:10:45,754 --> 01:10:47,514
Aw, would you put a sock in it?

1315
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:49,595
So, what else has
Renny got you up to?

1316
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:51,067
Running numbers?
Bad checks?

1317
01:10:51,068 --> 01:10:52,699
Bet you do her laundry, too.

1318
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,789
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1319
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,774
If you had kids,
you'd understand.

1320
01:10:55,775 --> 01:10:56,734
(Chuckling)

1321
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:57,759
- Uh-huh.

1322
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,679
Besides, we got probable cause.

1323
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,175
Citizen called in
a burglary in progress.

1324
01:11:02,176 --> 01:11:03,902
That citizen was you.

1325
01:11:03,903 --> 01:11:06,400
All right.
Look around down here.

1326
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:08,064
I'll take the upstairs.

1327
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:09,025
All right.

1328
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,938
Clark, you got anything?

1329
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:23,908
Clark!

1330
01:11:25,799 --> 01:11:27,910
Idiot.

1331
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:36,650
- Think you're right.
- Jesus!

1332
01:11:36,651 --> 01:11:38,411
It's not a barn, Clark!

1333
01:11:38,412 --> 01:11:40,106
You just about gave me
a "thrombo"!

1334
01:11:40,107 --> 01:11:42,540
You should cut down
on the donuts.

1335
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:43,564
What you got?

1336
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:45,325
Not even dust bunnies.

1337
01:11:45,326 --> 01:11:48,046
I want the number
of their cleaning lady.

1338
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:49,134
(Chuckling)

1339
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:50,223
I bet if we powdered,

1340
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:51,535
we wouldn't find one print.

1341
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,328
Something went down
here all right.

1342
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:55,024
There's new glass
in this window.

1343
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:57,745
Ah, yeah.
Fresh putty.

1344
01:12:01,396 --> 01:12:02,867
Give me a hand here.

1345
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:03,923
Yeah, sure.

1346
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,157
Yeah, I got it.

1347
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,559
(Clearing throat)

1348
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:18,938
Wait a minute.
What have we here?

1349
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:21,337
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,425
Nice catch.

1351
01:12:25,148 --> 01:12:26,874
All right, now.

1352
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,828
What do we got here?

1353
01:12:32,509 --> 01:12:34,878
Bingo.
Homo sapiens.

1354
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:40,062
So, climbed up...

1355
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,999
Then he ran across...

1356
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:48,127
Jumped over the side.

1357
01:12:52,127 --> 01:12:53,823
I'll talk to
the local precinct,

1358
01:12:53,824 --> 01:12:57,280
see if anything happened here
in the last couple of nights.

1359
01:12:57,281 --> 01:12:59,520
OK, Kit, just
don't move an inch.

1360
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:00,960
You know, Vandy knows

1361
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,329
you've been slipping treats
to his dog pack.

1362
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:04,833
So, why would that upset him?

1363
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:06,275
Well, because it's cheating.

1364
01:13:06,276 --> 01:13:08,005
Now, hold still.

1365
01:13:08,006 --> 01:13:10,307
Uh, what? Cheating?

1366
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:12,836
No, I call that
advanced situational prep.

1367
01:13:12,837 --> 01:13:15,717
Sorry I'm late, but I got
strangled in red tape.

1368
01:13:15,718 --> 01:13:17,317
Does it work?

1369
01:13:17,318 --> 01:13:19,173
(Kit):
Yeah, no problems.

1370
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:20,549
Jase here is a genius!

1371
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,654
Yeah, why your father
appointed me as director,

1372
01:13:23,655 --> 01:13:25,159
I will never know.

1373
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,559
Maybe he thought you were
the best man for the job.

1374
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,520
That's silly.

1375
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:29,736
There are many others

1376
01:13:29,737 --> 01:13:31,596
who could've been
better suited.

1377
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:33,771
Mr. Vandermaark,
for instance.

1378
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:35,724
Hey, so what's up
with this ring?

1379
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:37,036
Ah, the good mark,

1380
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,732
my most prized possession.

1381
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,525
Vandermaark has one
like it, yeah?

1382
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:42,415
It's given by
the Phantom to friends

1383
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:44,400
he's placed under
his personal protection.

1384
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:46,064
Oh. So do I get one?

1385
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:48,337
Come!

1386
01:13:48,338 --> 01:13:49,904
I have a surprise for you

1387
01:13:49,905 --> 01:13:51,922
that will make you
very happy... I think.

1388
01:13:51,923 --> 01:13:53,554
So do I get a ring?

1389
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,310
I started working on it
for your father

1390
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:09,366
before he passed away.

1391
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:11,190
He didn't like
the old suit either?

1392
01:14:11,191 --> 01:14:12,185
(Laughing)

1393
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:13,176
Are you kidding?

1394
01:14:13,177 --> 01:14:15,352
He loathed the old suit.

1395
01:14:15,353 --> 01:14:19,416
He felt it was too,
uh, theatrical.

1396
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:44,348
Ballistic vest and Cal helmet,

1397
01:14:44,349 --> 01:14:47,036
reinforced with contoured
carbon-Armour plates

1398
01:14:47,037 --> 01:14:49,854
and wired for cellular
and radio communication.

1399
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,007
What is this?

1400
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:53,055
- Ah, a layered micro-weave

1401
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:56,384
of Kevlar, Twaron
and Heracron fibres

1402
01:14:56,385 --> 01:14:59,139
skinned in a titanium-ceramic
alloy neuro-symbiotic mesh,

1403
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:02,947
resistant to heat
and small-arms fire.

1404
01:15:02,948 --> 01:15:04,452
Wait, neuro what?

1405
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:06,117
You know, kind of like

1406
01:15:06,117 --> 01:15:07,653
modern bio-electronic
prosthetics.

1407
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:08,869
In English.

1408
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:10,629
OK.

1409
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:14,662
When you tense, say in
anticipation of being struck,

1410
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,966
well, your brain sends
signals to your muscles

1411
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:18,695
and they, you know,
they contract.

1412
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:21,800
- Well, the neuro-symbiotic
mesh works in much the same way.

1413
01:15:21,801 --> 01:15:24,744
Its density is determined
by the signals from your brain

1414
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:27,369
and will protect you
from bladed weapons,

1415
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,289
falls and impacts.

1416
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,826
Oh wow!
That is so cool!

1417
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:32,874
Yes, and what is even more cool

1418
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,891
is that, like an
insect's exoskeleton,

1419
01:15:34,892 --> 01:15:37,515
the mesh effectively amplifies

1420
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:39,693
your innate speed and strength

1421
01:15:39,694 --> 01:15:42,286
by a factor of 2.5 times
your normal output!

1422
01:15:42,286 --> 01:15:44,078
Can I try it?

1423
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,122
(Sighing)

1424
01:15:51,123 --> 01:15:52,370
Are you comfortable?

1425
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:53,938
Yeah, feels nice.

1426
01:15:55,603 --> 01:15:56,882
(Groaning)

1427
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:58,580
Dr. Kim,
are we ready?

1428
01:15:58,581 --> 01:15:59,796
Yeah.

1429
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:02,004
Set.
We're hot.

1430
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:03,285
If you please,

1431
01:16:03,286 --> 01:16:04,757
punch the dummy

1432
01:16:04,758 --> 01:16:06,262
with all of your might.

1433
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,680
Go ahead.

1434
01:16:10,681 --> 01:16:12,472
(Chuckling)

1435
01:16:14,298 --> 01:16:16,633
No, no, no, no!
Not like that.

1436
01:16:16,634 --> 01:16:17,818
Not with a closed fist.

1437
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,963
You'll break every
bone in your hand.

1438
01:16:21,308 --> 01:16:23,291
Excellent.
OK, on the count of 3.

1439
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:27,102
One, two, three!

1440
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:28,318
(Electricity buzzing)

1441
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:30,751
Oh my! Look,
you've broken its neck.

1442
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,511
- Baboor, Baboor.
- Yes.

1443
01:16:32,512 --> 01:16:34,271
2,618.

1444
01:16:34,272 --> 01:16:35,296
What?

1445
01:16:35,297 --> 01:16:38,082
You've just struck that object

1446
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,034
with a force of over

1447
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:42,306
2,600 pounds per square inch!

1448
01:16:42,307 --> 01:16:43,620
(Applause)

1449
01:16:43,621 --> 01:16:45,157
(Kim): Yeah, yeah!

1450
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:46,117
Is that good?

1451
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,206
It's excellent!

1452
01:16:49,895 --> 01:16:52,391
A homeless guy called it in
almost a month ago.

1453
01:16:52,392 --> 01:16:55,240
Found in the area
you guys are talking about.

1454
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:57,351
Injury's consistent
with a fall.

1455
01:16:57,352 --> 01:16:58,633
ID?

1456
01:16:58,634 --> 01:16:59,944
John Doe.

1457
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:02,249
Guy was stripped
to his skivvies.

1458
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,689
No wallet, nothing.

1459
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:05,771
Ran DNA, prints.

1460
01:17:05,772 --> 01:17:07,051
No hits.

1461
01:17:07,052 --> 01:17:08,556
There you go.

1462
01:17:11,053 --> 01:17:12,685
It ain't him.

1463
01:17:12,686 --> 01:17:14,797
You sure this is the guy
from the warehouse?

1464
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:15,758
That's him.

1465
01:17:15,759 --> 01:17:17,199
Ran him through AFIS and CODIS.

1466
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,191
No hits.

1467
01:17:18,192 --> 01:17:19,599
What about Interpol?

1468
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,328
(Sighing)

1469
01:17:23,153 --> 01:17:25,298
Hello, Jeannot Roux.

1470
01:17:25,299 --> 01:17:27,571
This guy's one hard ass.

1471
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:27,699
What's that?
"Vio

1472
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,004
a- - This guy's one hard ass.

1473
01:17:30,005 --> 01:17:31,572
You know, that one right there.

1474
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:33,557
Aggravated rape.

1475
01:17:33,558 --> 01:17:35,639
The one right below:
"conduit obscene."

1476
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,238
Lewd conduct.

1477
01:17:37,239 --> 01:17:39,027
French sure is
the language of love.

1478
01:17:39,028 --> 01:17:41,332
No arrests after 2004.

1479
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:42,771
Hmm! Maybe he rehabbed.

1480
01:17:42,772 --> 01:17:43,765
(All chuckling)

1481
01:17:43,766 --> 01:17:45,877
Guys like this
don't go straight.

1482
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:47,061
They get proficient.

1483
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,213
Any K.A.'s?

1484
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:54,967
Whoa, look at that!

1485
01:17:54,968 --> 01:17:56,344
There's 2 of them.

1486
01:17:57,593 --> 01:17:59,065
Man, this one's worse.

1487
01:17:59,066 --> 01:18:01,432
Meutre. That's "murder," right?

1488
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:02,744
Yeah.

1489
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,634
I saw that on
the other guy's sheet.

1490
01:18:04,635 --> 01:18:05,657
2 counts.

1491
01:18:05,658 --> 01:18:07,641
4 counts, one conviction.
Manslaughter.

1492
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:10,330
Nothing after 2004.

1493
01:18:10,331 --> 01:18:12,411
These guys aren't
just proficient, huh?

1494
01:18:12,412 --> 01:18:14,301
They're professionals.

1495
01:18:17,694 --> 01:18:19,165
(Beeping)

1496
01:18:32,514 --> 01:18:34,530
(Beeping)

1497
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:45,992
(Sighing)

1498
01:18:48,775 --> 01:18:52,393
<i>(Man on TV): You'll notice
to the left of the Senator</i>

1499
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,546
<i>Mr. Grant Rogers.</i>

1500
01:18:53,547 --> 01:18:55,787
<i>He's been a friend
for many years,</i>

1501
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:57,867
<i>a lawyer as well
as an advisor.</i>

1502
01:18:57,868 --> 01:19:01,261
<i>Mr. Rogers is figuring
prominently in the news today,</i>

1503
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:04,525
<i>having received an acquittal
for Dr. Raymond Oliver.</i>

1504
01:19:04,526 --> 01:19:07,151
<i>Having a winning lawyer
at his side is...</i>

1505
01:19:18,226 --> 01:19:21,299
And terminate broadcast.

1506
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:30,359
(Panting)

1507
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,760
Indoctrination of
subject, Clark Ellis.

1508
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:34,105
Completed successfully.

1509
01:19:37,242 --> 01:19:39,835
<i>Senator Sinclair seems
to have a lot of support</i>

1510
01:19:39,836 --> 01:19:41,533
from the local community.

1511
01:19:41,534 --> 01:19:45,118
<i>And this November's election
looks to be shaping up</i>

1512
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:47,391
<i>as an easy win
for the Senator.</i>

1513
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:50,945
As the incumbent Senator,
he doesn't seem to have...

1514
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:01,351
To talk.

1515
01:20:01,352 --> 01:20:02,438
You're right.

1516
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:04,005
I'm glad you came down.

1517
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:05,253
Your attitude lately

1518
01:20:05,254 --> 01:20:07,650
makes me doubt the sincerity
of your commitment.

1519
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:09,026
What?

1520
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:11,492
It's been 2 months
and you've failed to demonstrate

1521
01:20:11,493 --> 01:20:13,476
the maturity and devotion
to duty necessary

1522
01:20:13,477 --> 01:20:15,045
to step into
the Phantom's shoes.

1523
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:16,965
I have done everything
you've asked!

1524
01:20:16,966 --> 01:20:19,174
And as far as I know,
I've been kicking ass.

1525
01:20:19,175 --> 01:20:20,807
Physically, yes.
But mentally...

1526
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:29,385
This whole process is designed
to be transformative.

1527
01:20:30,348 --> 01:20:32,171
In order to become the Phantom,

1528
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:34,059
you must let go
of your old life.

1529
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,115
I can't!

1530
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:39,022
The detective who broke this
case is my friend's father.

1531
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:40,686
According to this article,

1532
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:43,216
they've initiated
a major investigation.

1533
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:45,232
They think I've been murdered.
Good!

1534
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:46,896
It'll take you off the radar.

1535
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:48,498
And put him on it, dead centre!

1536
01:20:48,499 --> 01:20:49,650
He's a police officer.

1537
01:20:49,651 --> 01:20:51,347
He can take care
of the situation.

1538
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:52,562
That's not good enough.

1539
01:20:52,563 --> 01:20:53,875
I need to tell him I'm OK.

1540
01:20:53,876 --> 01:20:55,124
Out of the question.

1541
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:57,653
If he doesn't call off
this investigation,

1542
01:20:57,654 --> 01:20:59,062
the Singhs will kill him.

1543
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,182
You know that!

1544
01:21:00,182 --> 01:21:01,591
I will not permit you to risk

1545
01:21:01,592 --> 01:21:02,999
everything we are doing here.

1546
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,279
There is too much at stake.
