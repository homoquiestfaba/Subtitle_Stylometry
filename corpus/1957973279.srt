00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:15,989

(intense dramatic music)

00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:45,539
(demon roaring)

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,759
- [Narrator] Many moons ago,

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,149
isolated in the remote
mountains of Central America,

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,913
a small village named
Mangaño once thrived.

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,089
A primitive tribe of people,

11
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,779
they lived in harmony with
nature for many generations,

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,153
but now a time of
reckoning was upon the all.

13
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,959
Working in the simple mud
and grass hut of his father

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,909
and his grandfather before him,

15
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,029
using the skills that were
passed down through blood,

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,999
the village piñata maker, Hunumah,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,489
began the most important
creation in the history

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,490
of his village.

19
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:25,385
(soft tribal music)

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,489
For a mysterious drought had
claimed the once fertile land,

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,613
and the scorching sun
was becoming relentless.

22
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,579
Using the precious few droplets
of water to shape the clay,

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,833
his creation began to take form.

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,179
As food was becoming scarce,

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,479
the families prayed that
the evil would be driven out

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,243
and famine would not consume the land.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,919
The long, hot days melted
into cold, dark nights,

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,349
and the nights blurred into day

29
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,473
as Hanumah combined elements
of human and animal form.

30
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,471
(soft tribal music)

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,259
An unknown petulance began
to spread through the tribe,

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,069
and the shaman, the village
holy man named Antoop,

33
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,619
pleaded with the angry spirits to release

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,086
their deadly grip on his people.

35
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,819
(Antoop speaking in foreign language)

36
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,949
Their time was running out,

37
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,169
but the ancient craft could not be rushed,

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,083
as the mystical design of the
piñatas had to be precise.

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,579
But the vengeful wrath
of the spirits continued,

40
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,789
and the once-thriving valley
was now being consumed

41
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,097
by misery and despair.

42
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,098
(villagers wailing)

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,389
Surrounded by the cries of suffering,

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,040
Hanumah sculpted one hand
with the power of the bear.

45
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:04,050
(shaman chanting)

46
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,329
The laid pieces were joined,

47
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,973
and Hanumah prepared
the piñatas for firing.

48
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,609
(pig screeching)

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,609
Sacrificing a wild pig, the
shaman carefully removed

50
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,323
the freshly harvested heart.

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,539
The heart would be the central force

52
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,727
inside the piñata.

53
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,923
It would draw the evil through the clay.

54
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,433
From the tribe's holiest shrine,

55
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,129
Antoop removed one of the sacred stones

56
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,803
and focused its spiritual energy.

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,309
For once inside the head of the piñata,

58
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,069
the stone's power would
activate the sorcery

59
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,993
to seal away the evil forever.

60
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:01,589
(dramatic tribal music)

61
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,449
The time had come to make the pilgrimage

62
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,129
to the sacred site,

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,147
and Antoop led his people on the difficult

64
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,733
many day journey.

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,509
Hanumah added the final symbolic markings

66
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,976
to the piñatas.

67
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,653
The ceremony was now ready to begin.

68
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:21,705
(intense dramatic music)

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,209
At the sacred river, Antoop
inhaled from the pipe

70
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,513
of his forefathers, linking
him with the spiritual world.

71
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,269
He summoned the forces of nature

72
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,376
and cried out to the gods.

73
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:51,794
(Antoop yelling in foreign language)

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,929
(intense dramatic music)

75
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,659
One by one he called his people forward.

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,939
The shaman believed the
curse was a punishment

77
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,949
from the angry spirits for the sins

78
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,929
in the villager's hearts,

79
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,936
the dark side that is a part of us all,

80
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:11,403
and he began the ritual
to cleanse their soul.

81
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:16,617
(demons screeching)

82
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,389
(dramatic tribal music)

83
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,519
Touching the good fortune piñata,

84
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,020
the villagers would complete
the circle of energy.

85
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,226
(dramatic tribal music)

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,859
The transfer was now final,

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,839
and the evil force was trapped inside

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,553
the clay cavity of the piñata.

89
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,549
Silent prayers were uttered
as Antoop carefully set

90
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,143
the grotesque piñata afloat.

91
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,559
The steady current of the holy river

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,243
would carry away the evil.

93
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:55,591
(intense dramatic music)

94
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,409
(clay shattering)

95
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,259
The ceremony continued with the cracking

96
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,575
of the good fortune piñata.

97
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,576
(children whooping)

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,979
As the sin-filled piñata floated away,

99
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,498
the forces of nature continued to build.

100
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:29,762
(thunder clapping)

101
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:32,362
(lightning zapping)

102
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,311
(explosion booming)

103
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,909
Antoop's task was now complete with

104
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,099
the final bolt of energy.

105
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,679
As long as the piñata lay undisturbed,

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,749
the evil would remain locked inside

107
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,389
by the magically-charged clay.

108
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,879
But should the sinful force be awakened,

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,329
an unholy terror would be
unleashed upon mankind,

110
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,579
a terror with a craving
for the eternal power

111
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,905
of innocent souls, bringing
death and destruction

112
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,489
to all in its path.

113
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:02,546

with the love of your life,

wondering why the hell you're
like in the other boat,

142
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,023
when I find out Romeo and
Juliet aren't together anymore.

143
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,329
So what's going on, man?

144
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,679
- We broke up.

145
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,599
- No shit. What happened?

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,739
- Nothin'.

147
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,580
Just time to move on.

148
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
- Oh.

149
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,590
You cheated.

150
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,810
She cheated?

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,546
- Doug, just let it go.

152
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:15,547
- All right, all right.

153
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,230
If that's the way you want it.

154
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,481
- That's the way I want it.

155
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,072
- Mmm.

156
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,210
So can a brother get down?

157
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,270
- Good luck.

158
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,539
- So, have you talked to him yet?

159
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,483
- He's already made up
his mind, so whatever.

- Welcome to the 12th annual
Cinco de Mayo scavenger hunt!

(group cheering and clapping)

165
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,919
- I'm Paul, a Beta Chi Omega alum.

166
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
- Beta Chi! Woo!

167
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,729
- All right!
- Woo-woo!

168
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,749
- I'm one of the judges.

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,286
And this is the other judge.

170
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:06,147
- [Student] Ooh, baby. Yeah!
(student wolf whistling)

171
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,549
- Hi, I'm Monica, alum
from Kappa Beta Chi.

172
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,629
- They'll fuck any guy.

173
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,189
- Just give 'em a try.

174
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,929
- All right, I am here
to prove to you guys

175
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,009
that you're gonna have a blast,

176
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,599
but first we have to set up camp.

177
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,236
- Which is about a
10-minute trek from here.

178
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:19,349
- Excuse me, is there
like a bathroom nearby?

179
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,999
- There's a portable at the camp.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,681
- A port-a-potty. You're kidding me?

181
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,209
- Oh, girl, what did you expect?

182
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,349
- The girls at the house

00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,799
- Bite me!

187
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,999
- Uh-uh-uh-uh, there will
be no sexual activity

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,543
on this island unless
I am directly involved.

(group whooping)

190
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,019
So with that in mind, you
have an hour to get settled,

191
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,069
and then the hunt begins.

192
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,775

behind Cinco de Mayo.

It's all the same.

ain't a game show, honey.

260

Okay, forget that one.

What about funny creative?

277
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:17,849
I mean, give me five pairs.

First, Jake and Julie.

322
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,663
Unacceptable.
- Seriously.

323
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:57,708
- [Kyle] They can't be a team.

324
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,739
- Guys, listen. No switches.

325
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,389
We have to stick to the
pairings on the list.

326
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,223
Tradition.

327
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:02,160

This cannot be happening.
(fly buzzing)

332
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,360
- [Paul] On your mark.

333
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:13,353
- Say bye to wine, darling.

334
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,570

340
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,299
- I'm not doing anything.

341
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,949
- You know what? Stop pulling.

342
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,209
- Don't tell me what to do.

343
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,619
I'm trying to get us out.

344
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,119

345
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,587

Ugh, can it get any worse?

349
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,769
- We can invite your little
study partner to join us.

350
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,649
I bet you'd like that.

351

- Yeah, I guess I was.
- Ow.

353
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,809
Looks like we'll just have to sit here

354
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,189
and wait till it's over.

355
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,479
How exciting for me.

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,120
- It's not like we're trying to score

364
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,135
a touchdown here!

365
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:33,969
- Ugh, yes we are!

366
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:34,969
- Ow!

367
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:40,265
(upbeat pop/rock music)

368
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,514
- Oh! (gasping)

369
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,686
Totally cool.
- See?

370
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,889
- I told you to trust me.

371
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,919
- Oh, cool.

372
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,079
- Check this out.

373
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,686
- What's that? Where'd you get that?

374
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,949
- Beta's have connections.

375
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,089
- Can't we get disqualified?

376
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,189
- No one's gonna know.
You wanna win, right?

377
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,023
Huh?

378
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,769
We'll just put 'em back on after.

379
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,483
Come on. Let's have some fun, huh?

380
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,850
What do you say?

381
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,013
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

382
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:06,804
Ah!

383
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:09,354
- Okay.

384
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,733
You up for it, hmm?

385
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
Good stuff.

386
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,702

00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:26,425
Can't forget that one.

406
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:32,949
Totally cool.

407
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:38,224

408
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,024

(soft mysterious music)

413
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:10,260
(chuckling) Hey, Bill!

414
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:11,261
Bill!

415
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:18,479
- Bob. Bob.
- What?

416
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,812
- My name is Bob, not Bill. Bob.

417
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,875
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

418
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:26,673
Bob, why are you whispering?

419
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,833
- I don't know. That's
a very good question.

420
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,810
- Oh.

421
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,863
Check it out.

422
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:39,210
- Oh, wow. Where'd you get that?

423
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,503
- It was stuck in the mud.

424
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,173
- What is it?

425
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:44,249
- I think it's a piñata.

426
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,809
- Pretty scary lookin', huh?

427
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,723
- Oh no. I think it's totally cool.

428
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,599
- What's in it?

429
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,039
- I don't know.

430
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,469
But it's definitely not from this year.

431
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,311
Who knows what they used
to put in these things.

432
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:59,982
(both laughing)

433
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,623
- Let's crack it open.

434
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,642
- No, we shouldn't.
- Why?

435
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:05,852
It's just a piñata.

436
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,053
Come on, dude.

437
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,803
- Yeah, you're right.

438
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,938
- All right, we need
something to hit it with.

439
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,737
- Okay, okay.

440
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,371
(branch snapping)

441
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,205
(branch thudding)

442
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,169
- Damn.

443
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,829
What the hell is this shit made of?

444
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
- Okay, hey.

445
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,919
How about a rock?

446
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,539
- Excellent idea.

447
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,553
That is like a great idea.

448
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:38,377
A rock.

449
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,357
(Lisa laughing)

450
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:46,441
(dark ominous music)

451
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,743
- Hey! How about this?

452
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:52,536
- Perfect.

453
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:55,704
That is like the fuckin' perfect rock.

454
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,151
(kisses smacking)

455
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:00,829
(Lisa giggling)

456
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,830
(rock thudding)
(dark ominous music)

457
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:15,135
(rock thudding)
(demons screeching)

458
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:17,053
Yeah! I think I got it.

459
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:21,088
(demon screeching)

460
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,700
- Do you hear that?

461
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,701
- What the fuck is that?

462
00:21:27,006 --> 00:21:29,673
(demon roaring)

463
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,390
(demons screeching)

464
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,350
Do you hear that?

465
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,351
- What the hell is that?

466
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,340
(leaves rustling)
(demons screeching)

467
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,708
(lightning zapping)

468
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:58,261
(dark ominous music)

469
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:03,231
What was in that pot?

470
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,409
- That was like totally fucked.

471
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,410
- Huh?

472
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,283
(wind howling)

473
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,623
- [Lisa] Where'd it go?

474
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,890
- [Bob] It was right there.

475
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:16,499
- A piñata, right?

476
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,539
We were cracking a piñata?

477
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,686
- [Bob] Yeah.

478
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:22,751
(demons screeching)

479
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:26,263
(demon growling)

480
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:28,815
(demon roaring)

481
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,048
- Let's get outta here.

482
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,829
(demon roaring)
(blood splattering)

483
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,580
(Lisa screaming)

484
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,796
(demon roaring)

485
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:38,575
(Lisa screaming)

486
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:41,487
(demon roaring)

487
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:44,238
(Lisa screaming)

488
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,081
(demon growling)

489
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:50,832
(demon roaring)

490
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:55,364
(demon laughing)

491
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,579
- What do you say about a truce?

492
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
- Hell no.

493
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,340
- What? You just wanna sit around

494
00:23:11,341 --> 00:23:12,779
and do nothin' 'til dinner?

495
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,949
- No, I'd rather be playing,

496
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,539
just with someone other than you.

497
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,969
- The feeling's mutual, but I
ain't sittin' around all day.

498
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,079
- What are you doing?

499
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,659
- Look, the Delta's have won
this three out of eight years,

500
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,069
and I wanna make it four.

501
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,179
We have a 60 pair start,

502
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,459
so either I drag your
sorry ass around the woods,

503
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,129
or you help me and we win this together.

504
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,280
- You wouldn't drag me.

505
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,290
- You wanna bet?

506
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,350
What's it gonna be?

507
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,279
All right.

508
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,839
- Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, okay.

509
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,371
Wait, these things hurt!

510
00:23:41,372 --> 00:23:42,869
- Stop your complainin'.

511
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,909
You begged me for weeks
to use handcuffs on you.

512
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,083
You just got your wish.

513
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,653
Now play nice and let's go.

514
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,389
- [Connie] I thought you
said it wasn't that far.

515
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,390
- Almost there.

516
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,463
There. That's the last marker.

517
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,543
Beta Chi's rule!

518
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,276
Let's see. It's over here.

519
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:11,002
(branches snapping)

520
00:24:11,002 --> 00:24:12,002
Shh.
- What?

521
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,420
- I think someone's comin'.

522
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
- I don't hear anything.

523
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:21,421
(dark ominous music)

524
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:22,255
(brush rustling)

525
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,549
- There!

526
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,550
Do you hear it?

527
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,426
- Oh, it sounds like
they're coming this way.

528
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:28,475
Hey!
- Hey, stop!

529
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,093
- What?
- They'll hear us. Come on!

530
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,374
(dark ominous music)

531
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:41,882
Get down.

532
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,621
Shh. Shh. Be quiet.

533
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:49,824
They're coming.

534
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:50,658
- Come on, it's just-

535
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,625
- [Larry] Just be quiet.

536
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:57,626
- [Connie] I still can't hear anything.

537
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:00,579
(intense dramatic music)

538
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,969
- What the hell are you doing?

539
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,569
- Right, Bob. I.

540
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,577
- What's wrong?

541
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:07,124
- Bob, he's, he's, he's dead.

542
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,772
Bob, Bob, Bob is dead!

543
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,908
- Bob's dead?

544
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,611
- No, yeah, he's dead.

545
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:12,716
- What happened?

546
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:14,919
- No, he, he, he's dead!

547
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,590
A pin, a piñata came, came to life

548
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,009
and smashed his head and killed him!

549
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,843
We gotta get outta here.

550
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:22,409
We gotta get outta here.

551
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,699
We gotta get outta here.

552
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,809
- Man, you reek!

553
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,339
What, you've been smokin' mota, too?

554
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,090
- You know, this isn't funny, Lisa.

555
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:30,537
Ew.

556
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:31,609
- Good blood!

557
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,329
- How'd you get the handcuffs off?

558
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,163
- Oh, god!

559
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:34,996
- So what?

560
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:36,179
You get us to go back while Bob scores

561
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,289
all the underwear?

562
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,389
Nice try, sister. (chuckling)

563
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,979
It's not gonna happen.

564
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,338
I don't think so.

565
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,286
(Lisa gasping)

566
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,167
- Oh, god.

567
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,526
Oh, god!

568
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:46,619
(Larry laughing)

569
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,973
- She's out of her mind.

570
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:52,259
You know, what some people will do to win.

571
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,406
- Oh, you should talk, Mr. Secret Stash.

572
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:58,199
- Well, yeah. You're right!

573
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,650
We're wasting time. Let's go!

574
00:26:01,068 --> 00:26:03,818
(demons roaring)

575
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:13,499
- You know, she almost had me there until

576
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,759
the killed by the piñata line.

577
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,593
- I know.

578
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:17,209
Like why didn't she say it was, you know,

579
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,809
like a wild animal or something?

580
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,099
- I'm gonna believe like a bear

581
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,113
or like an escaped convict or something.

582
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:25,320
- A piñata. (laughing)

583
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,962
God. (laughing)

584
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,380
(intense dramatic music)

585
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,608
So how much further?

586
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,797
- Shouldn't be far.

587
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,798
(demons screeching)

588
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:52,068
(dramatic tribal music)

589
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,195
Shh.

590
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,279
- What is wrong?

591
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,335
- Over there.

592
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,262
(demon growling)

593
00:27:02,263 --> 00:27:03,210
There he is!

594
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,316
- Oh, shit! Run for your lives!

595
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:07,301
- No, come on! We can take 'em!

596
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:09,617
(demons roaring)

597
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:12,528
This is for Bob, you evil piñata!

598
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:14,573
(piñata shattering)

599
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:16,638
(demon growling)

600
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:19,366
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

601
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:21,650
All right, there you go.

602
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:24,318
(demon roaring)

603
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:31,571
Bitch.
(Connie laughing)

604
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:34,469
- I don't know how else to explain this.

605
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,470
Um.

606
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,579
It's hard to believe what I saw,

607
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,293
but I know, I know what I saw.

608
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,587
It was a piñata.

609
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,330
That's what it was.

610
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,992
And now Bill is dead, Bill is dead from-

611
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:53,010
- Bob.

612
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,011
- Bob.

613
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,020
Bob, right.

614
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,730
Um.

615
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,829
How could this happen?

616
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,880
I don't understand.
- Just take it easy.

617
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,649
- You'd understand, you know,

618
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,159
if he fell out of a tree or,

619
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,849
or hit his head on a rock, you know?

620
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,850
Shit happens.

621
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:21,659
But.

622
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,769
Okay, yes, we were drinking.

623
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,359
And yes, we were smoking.

624
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,699
But I know what I saw,

625
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,239
and as crazy as it sounds, it happened.

626
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,283
And, um.

627
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,583
I should've just left the
damn thing in the mud.

628
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,510
We have to get off this island.

629
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:49,841
(dirt and rocks clattering)

630
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:53,634
- Oh, yeah. Who's the
man, baby? (laughing)

631
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:54,635
One, two.

632
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:57,129
Three, four.

633
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,606
Five, six.

634
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:04,201
(shovel thudding)

635
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:07,535
(dramatic tribal music)

636
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:12,721
Woo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah!

637
00:29:13,575 --> 00:29:14,729
(demon roaring)

638
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,559
All right! What did I tell you?

639
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,231
- Beta Chi's rule!
- Yeah!

640
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,232
Woo-hoo-hoo!

641
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:22,278
All right.

642
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,489
Yeah, we hit the mother load, baby!

643
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,490
Woo-hoo!

644
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,136
- Hey, stop pullin'.

645
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:31,136
- Come on!

646
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:34,949
Yeah!
- Okay, we're set.

647
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,200
- All right, let's...

648
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,133
Where the hell did it go?

649
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:40,472
(demon roaring)

650
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:43,379
(Larry screaming)

651
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,732
Connie!

652
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:47,424
(demon roaring)

653
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:51,466
(shovel thudding)
(Larry screaming)

654
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:52,809
Oh no!

655
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,227
Ah, ah! Get away!

656
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,750
No!

657
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:06,054
(demon roaring)
(Larry screaming)

658
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,809
- Do you believe her or do you think

659
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,610
this is some sort of practical joke?

660
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,739
I mean, what do you think she saw?

661
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,840
- I don't know.

662
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,920
- Do you think he's dead?

663
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,869
- Why would she lie?

664
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,973
And if he isn't, where is he?

665
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,619
Something happened out there.

666
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,239
The question is what.

667
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,799
(engine starting)

668
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,629
- Well, what Maureen didn't
see was me slapping him

669
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,583
in the face after he kissed me.

670
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:39,779
I mean, I didn't know he was
gonna do that, believe me.

671
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,509
I have no interest in that guy whatsoever.

672
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,309
Besides, he's an arrogant asshole

673
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,760
and I haven't seen him since.

674
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,300
What?

675
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:49,889
You don't believe me now?

676
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,569
- No, just hurry up and concentrate.

677
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,889
You're gettin' really heavy.

678
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,319
- Oh, so now I'm fat?

679
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,489
- No.

680
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,579
Just get 'em all down so
you can get your ass down.

681
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,809
- Well, you can believe what you want.

682
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,369
I told you the truth.

683
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,509
- Fine.

684
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,860
- A little to the left now.

685
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:07,499
(Kyle grunting)

686
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
- [Kyle] Yeah.

687
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,599
- Okay, down, please.

688
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,650
- Yes, Your Highness.

689
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:18,088
(engines rumbling)

690
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,517
Hey, what's up?

691
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:22,709
- You guys all right?

692
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,943
- Never been better.

693
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,280
- What are you doing?

694
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:27,419
- You disappointed?

695
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,799
- [Monica] The game's over.

696
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,879
- We didn't hear a gunshot.

697
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
- Yeah, who won?

698
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,103
- Well, uh, somebody got hurt,
so we're stopping the game.

699
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,679
- Who? What happened?

700
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,879
- Bob had an accident.

701
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,169
- Is it serious?

702
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,909
- Well, we're on our way to check it out.

703
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,229
- Do you need any help?

704
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,619
- Yeah, uh, get back to
camp as quickly as you can.

705
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,079
In my side duffel is my starter's pistol.

706
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,629
Fire off a shot for the others
and start packing your gear.

707
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,609
- Here. In case we need to coordinate.

708
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,779
- Are we leaving?

709
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,009
- Maybe.

710
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,689
- If y'all pass any of the
others on the way back,

711
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,799
let 'em know what's going on.

712
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,969
- Lisa's already there.

713
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,859
She's pretty upset about Bob.

714
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Be careful.

715
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:09,062
- [Monica] Bob!

716
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:16,494
- [Paul] Bob, where are you?

717
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:17,872
Bob!

718
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:18,873
- Bob?

719
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,960
(tense suspenseful music)

720
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:27,917
Bob!

721
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:30,725
- Bob!

722
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:34,790
(engines rumbling)

723
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:38,892
Bob!

724
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:40,855
- [Monica] Bob!

725
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,593
- [Both] Bob!

726
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:57,785
- Bob?

727
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:03,735
(tense suspenseful music)

728
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:06,348
- Bob!

729
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:09,933
Bob!

730
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:10,934
- Bob!

731
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:12,659
- Bob?

732
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:15,838
- [Monica] Bob, it's Monica.

733
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,633
(branch snapping)

734
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,467
(bird fluttering)

735
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,844
(birds chirping)

736
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:28,184
- Bob.

737
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:30,646
- [Both] Bob?

738
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:34,644
- [Paul] Bob?

739
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:37,628
- Bob?

740
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:41,008
(Monica screaming)
(intense dramatic music)

741
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:42,009
Oh, god! No!

742
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,089
Oh, god! Oh!

743
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:52,444
(flies buzzing)
(dramatic solemn music)

744
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:59,031
(upbeat hip hop music)

745
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,235
(demon growling)

746
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:10,977
(upbeat hip hop music)

747
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,783
(demon growling)

748
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:20,408
(upbeat hip hop music)

749
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,844
(demon growling)

750
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:30,333
- Don't you think we should
finish counting our score?

751
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,227
- But we were scoring pretty good.

752
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:36,914
- We were. What was it?

753
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:37,915
121.

754
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:39,947
122.

755
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:42,903
I thought you wanted to win.

756
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,509
- I do, but-

757
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,279
- Well then, let's go.

758
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,727
You're not a loser, are you?

759
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:51,747
Come on.

760
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,213
123.

761
00:34:53,214 --> 00:34:54,180
124.

762
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,276
125.

763
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:57,123
125 plus your?

764
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,299
- Ah, 147.

765
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,339
- Equals two?

766
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,963
- 272.
- 272.

767
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Not bad.

768
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,368
- And we still got some time left.

769
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,839
(demon growling)

770
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,749
Ooh, missed that one.

771
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,660
Pretty cool-lookin' piñata.

772
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,469
- No, it's gross.

773
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,789
- Let's go check it out.

774
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,439
Then we gotta get goin'.

775
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,740
- Whatever you say, chief.

776
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,722
(demon growling)

777
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,679
- Probably hold a fifth
of tequila in that sucker.

778
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,504
- Then what are you gonna drink?

779
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:35,088
- I don't think so.

780
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,152
(Julie laughing)

781
00:35:39,153 --> 00:35:40,153
Ooo, scary.

782
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,124
Let's open you up there, big guy.

783
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,655
(demon roaring)

784
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:48,913
(Julie screaming)

785
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,664
(Jake screaming)

786
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:56,471
- Jake! Jake!

787
00:35:56,472 --> 00:36:01,472
(Jake screaming)
(demon roaring)

788
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:09,317
(Julie screaming)
(Jake screaming)

789
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:14,979
(Julie screaming)
(demon roaring)

790
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:18,582
(gun firing)

791
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,416
- What's up with that?

792
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,509
- I don't know. It's not time yet.

793
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,920
- Shit!

794
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:24,609
Here we go!

795
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,527
- Get those! Get those!

796
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:30,466
(birds chirping)

797
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,379
- [Lisa] We've gotta get off this island.

798
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,361
I know what I saw.

799
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,548
- [Larry] Bob's dead?

800
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:39,096
- Piñata. I know what I saw.

801
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,365
I know what I saw.

802
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,105
You guys should've just left everything.

803
00:36:43,106 --> 00:36:44,462
How can this happen?

804
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,101
I know what I saw.

805
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:47,834
- [Bob] It's just a piñata.

806
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:49,036
It's just a piñata.

807
00:36:49,037 --> 00:36:50,620
It's just a piñata.

808
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:59,085
(soft solemn music)

809
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:12,038
- Thanks.

810
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,569
- Look, I'm sorry for
jumping to conclusions about-

811
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,489
- You know what? It's okay.

812
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,289
I probably would've reacted the same way

813
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,840
if the situation were reversed.

814
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
- I miss you, T.

815
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,190
- Yeah, me too.

816
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:31,286
(soft solemn music)

817
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,360
(tense suspenseful music)

818
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,417
- Kyle, it's Paul. Are you there?

819
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,869
(radio static crackling)

820
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,729
Kyle, it's Paul.

821
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,930
- [Kyle] Go ahead, Paul.

822
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,899
- Who's there with you?

823
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,849
- [Kyle] Tina and Lisa.

824
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,079
- No one else?

825
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,099
- [Kyle] Not yet.

826
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,339
- Shit.

827
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,759
Okay, get down to the boats right away.

828
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
- [Kyle] What is it?

829
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,053
- Bob's dead.

830
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:17,920
We just found him strung up
in a tree, ripped in half.

831
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,760
- What?

832
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:23,410
- [Paul] His head was bashed
in like a fresh pumpkin.

833
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,663
Kyle? Kyle, are you there?

834
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,149
- Yeah.

835
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,089
- Grab whatever you can
and get down to the boats.

836
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,209
We'll try to find the others
and direct them to the beach.

837
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,799
As soon as you've got a full boat,

838
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,205
take off back to camp.

839
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:41,969
The rest of us will take the second boat.

840
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,619
Be careful.

841
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,239
Someone or something's out there

842
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,273
and it's majorly fucked up.

843
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,825
(engines starting)

844
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:53,243
(intense dramatic music)

845
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:57,513
- [Paul] Jake!
- [Monica] Jake!

846
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,720
- What happened out there?

847
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,039
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

848
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
- Try me.

849
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:15,945
- [Paul] Julie!
- [Monica] Julie!

850
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:16,946
Connie!

851
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:23,367
(demon roaring)

852
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:24,610
- [Doug] Okay, whoa, whoa. You all right?

853
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:26,039
- [Carmen] Yeah.
- All right, this way.

854
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,049
- Are you sure this is right?

855
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,700
- Yeah, I'm sure, girl. I'm Doug.

856
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,729
- Great. We're lost.

857
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,109
- No, we're not lost, we're not lost.

858
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,493
Look, we're just, uh, we're
taking the scenic route.

859
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:40,289
- Everything is scenic out here, Doug.

860
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,123
- I know, I know.

861
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:41,956
But listen, I promise you.

862
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:43,979
We're gonna get back and
we're gonna win this.

863
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,030
A little extra walk is not gonna kill ya.

864
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:50,662
(waves lapping)

865
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,365
- Shit.

866
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:00,366
- Oh my god.

867
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,401
(dramatic mysterious music)

868
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:31,296
(engines rumbling)

869
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:35,016
- [Paul] Doug?

870
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:37,934
(engines rumbling)

871
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:58,378
(intense dramatic music)
(Monica screaming)

872
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:01,046
(demon roaring)

873
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,483
Straight! Keep going! Faster!

874
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:08,555
(engines revving)
- [Monica] Come on!

875
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:11,223
(demon roaring)

876
00:41:13,686 --> 00:41:16,436
(engine revving)

877
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:18,919
Paul!

878
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,955
(demon roaring)

879
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:25,373
(intense dramatic music)

880
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:30,237
- [Paul] More gas! Don't stop!

881
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,657
- [Monica] It's getting closer!

882
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,799
(demon roaring)

883
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
- Watch out!

884
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,575
(demon roaring)

885
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:42,951
Come on! Move it!

886
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:44,285
Hurry! This way!

887

Move! Move!

Hurry!

(intense dramatic music)

896
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,164
Keep movin'.

897

898
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:29,143

901
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:38,488

Paul! No!

(Monica screaming)

905
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,142
- Get outta here!

906
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:48,432
Monica, go!
- No, Paul!

907
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:53,405

00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:22,165
(crickets chirping)
(flames crackling)

917
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,090
- Okay, maybe it's like a
wild animal or something.

918
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,599
- Have you ever heard of a wild animal

919
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,299
that strings someone
up after killing them?

920
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,219
- Okay, so maybe it was
some screwed up hermit

921
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,979
that no one knew was
living here on the island.

922
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,330
- Did you get a good look
at the piñata's feet?

923
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,803
- I, uh, I don't remember.

924
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,500
- Were they hoofed? Try to think.

925
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,653
- It happened so fast. I don't know.

926
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,379
But I saw its eyes,
and they were fiery red

927
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,639
and glowing and-

928
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,588
- Why are we still talking about this?

929
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:02,639
I mean, you guys don't actually believe

930
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,740
there's a killer piñata out there, do you?

931
00:45:05,683 --> 00:45:07,083
- I don't know what I think.

932
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,949
There's this old Mexican
folklore I studied about

933
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,800
that fits what Lisa's description is.

934
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,719
It tells a story of Magaño,

935
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,579
a small, remote village
in Central America.

936
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,930
- That had a killer piñata?

937
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,799
- The village was
prosperous until suddenly

938
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,350
famine and disease consumed it.

939
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,179
The shaman figured it was
the sins of the people

940
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,219
that brought on this curse.

941
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,159
So he decided to perform a ceremony to rid

942
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,210
the land of the evilness in their hearts.

943
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,689
He created two symbolic piñatas.

944
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,009
One to represent good fortune,

945
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,719
and the other to be used as a receptacle

946
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,509
for the transgressions
of the entire village.

947
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,399
He symbolically transferred the sins

948
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,359
onto the piñata and cast it
off by setting it out to sea.

949
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,349
Now, according to the folklore,
prosperity soon returned

950
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,509
and the piñata was never seen again.

951
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,423
- So you think that's what's out there?

952
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,869
- I saw prints near the
wreckage of the boats

953
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,153
that was made by a
creature with hoofed feet.

954
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,909
Now the legend says that this piñata

955
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,423
had two hoofed feet, and
the actual heart of a pig.

956
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,779
It's upper body is very
human-like with fire-red eyes

957
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,163
and horns on its head.

958
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,619
- Like the devil.

959
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,120
- Okay, is there any proof
of this ever happening?

960
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,053
- No.

961
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:22,925
- Well then how do we know?

962
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,149
- Look, just because they
haven't found any proof

963
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,529
doesn't mean it never
really ever happened.

964
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,389
- Well, usually they have
something to support it

965
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,223
if it's true.

966
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:29,429
- No, they're finding
things in the Middle East

967
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,259
everyday that supports
stories in the Old Testament.

968
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,739
Now does that mean the Red
Sea was ever really parted?

969
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,419
Maybe the evidence didn't survive time,

970
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,309
or perhaps it's still waiting to be found.

971
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,709
- But a piñata coming
alive and killing people?

972
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,776
I mean, that's a bit out
there, don't you think?

973
00:46:42,777 --> 00:46:45,723
- Did the legend say anything
about it coming to life?

974
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,199
- Not that I recall.

975
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,750
- Then how do you explain that?

976
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,780
- We were hitting it with a stone,

977
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,190
trying to break it open
to see what was inside.

978
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,999
And when we finally cracked it,

979
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
we heard a sound like,
like we were letting out

980
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,289
the pain and suffering
of an entire village.

981
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,329
I had no idea how to describe it

982
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,980
until you just put it into words.

983
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,859
We thought it was because we were high,

984
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,950
but that is exactly what it sounded like.

985
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:22,833
- Have you ever heard of an animal

986
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:25,245
with only two hoofed feet?

987
00:47:25,246 --> 00:47:30,246
(demon roaring)
(intense dramatic music)

988
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:44,911
(bird cawing)
(Lisa gasping)

989
00:47:44,912 --> 00:47:49,912
(demon roaring)
(intense dramatic music)

990
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,460
(Lisa gasping)

991
00:47:56,461 --> 00:47:59,984
(metal clanging)

992
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:01,425
- [Tina] What was that?

993
00:48:01,426 --> 00:48:02,593
- Who's there?

994
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:05,939
- [Tina] Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

995
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,429
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

996
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,930
- [Kyle] Shh, shh.

997
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,930
(intense dramatic music)

998
00:48:23,496 --> 00:48:25,112
(Doug and Carmen screaming)
(Lisa screaming)

999
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,749
- What the hell are you doing?

1000
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,583
- What's wrong?

1001
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:29,770
We're just having a little fun.

1002
00:48:29,771 --> 00:48:30,604
- It's not funny.

1003
00:48:30,605 --> 00:48:32,519
- Obviously you guys don't
know what's been going on?

1004
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,920
- Ooo, what's been going on?

1005
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,310
- Hey, where's everyone else?

1006
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:43,863
(intense dramatic music)

1007
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,466
(insects chirping)

1008
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,792
(water rippling)

1009
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:03,366
(birds chirping)

1010
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,070
- All right, we've given
them a couple hours.

1011
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,000
It's light and there's no response

1012
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,109
from the walkie talkie.

1013
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,401
Let's get goin'.

1014
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:24,562
Everyone stay close together.

1015
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:27,689
- Why don't we try and
swim back to campus?

1016
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:28,690
- What?

1017
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,079
- Swim. Why don't we swim?

1018
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,059
- It's 15 miles, Lisa.

1019
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,919
- Yeah, so. Marathons are 26.

1020
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,999
- I'm not that good of a swimmer.

1021
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,833
- The ocean's different.

1022
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:37,666
We'd never make it.

1023
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,720
- A boat would see us?

1024
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,523
- Maybe.

1025
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:41,639
- And what about sharks?

1026
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,259
- Fine.

1027
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,262
Fine, then why don't we
just stay right here.

1028
00:49:45,263 --> 00:49:46,313
- You know what?

1029
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:47,147
There's six of our friends out there

1030
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:48,389
that may need our help.

1031
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,439
- We'd do the same for you.

1032
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,329
- It's not that I don't
want to help them, okay?

1033
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,369
It's just that what are we gonna do?

1034
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,569
We're gonna get ourselves killed.

1035
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,129
What is that gonna do?

1036
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,179
If we stay here, we could
write emergency messages,

1037
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,409
put 'em in bottles-

1038
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,243
- Lisa.
- No, wait.

1039
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:04,589
And then one of us could
go down and throw them

1040
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,509
in the water and then maybe
someone will find them.

1041
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,699
- It could take decades for
someone to get that bottle.

1042
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,570
- Okay, fine.

1043
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,879
Then let's stay here and wait 'til someone

1044
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,859
back at school realizes
that something's wrong

1045
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,939
and sends another boat.

1046
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,226
- Maybe she's right.

1047
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:17,429
Look, they'll probably
send another boat tomorrow

1048
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,439
or the day after, for sure, right?

1049
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,869
- Yeah, and how do we even
know they're still alive?

1050
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,009
- How do we know they're not?

1051
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,359
- Well, hey, I mean, we made it back.

1052
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,443
- Yeah, so did we.

1053
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,409
- If it were me out there,

1054
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,209
I would want us to be smart

1055
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,879
and stay in an open area like this.

1056
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,999
Not out there where it has the advantage.

1057
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,289
- She has a point.

1058
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:38,909
Look, nothing happened
to us last night, guys.

1059
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,049
- You know what? I'm out.

1060
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,609
I'm going to help my friends.

1061
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,510
- Hang on.

1062
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:44,282
It's stupid for us to split up.

1063
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:46,229
It's a good way to find
yourself wakin' up dead.

1064
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,100
- I agree with that.

1065
00:50:47,101 --> 00:50:49,413
- Look, either we all stay or we all go.

1066
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,600
We might die either way.

1067
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:53,609
We don't know it's safer to stay here.

1068
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:54,443
Me personally?

1069
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:55,559
My vote is to try to help our friends

1070
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,210
rather than hide and hope
someone comes to rescue us.

1071
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,737
Brothers and sisters, right?

1072
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:10,199
(upbeat dramatic music)

1073
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:44,317
(tense suspenseful music)

1074
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:09,933
(demon roaring)

1075
00:52:09,934 --> 00:52:11,860
- [Lisa] Jake!

1076
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:12,861
Jake!

1077
00:52:15,396 --> 00:52:16,396
You good?

1078
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:18,202
Kyle!

1079
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:27,405
(demon growling)

1080
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:33,752
(feet stomping)

1081
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:39,263
(soft suspenseful music)

1082
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:48,898
(Kyle sniffing)

1083
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:49,982
- [Doug] Ugh!

1084
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:54,741
- What is that smell?

1085
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:03,335
(leaves rustling)

1086
00:53:05,275 --> 00:53:08,775
(tense suspenseful music)

1087
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:24,073
(intense dramatic music)

1088
00:53:25,693 --> 00:53:28,667
(flies buzzing)

1089
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:29,668
- Uh!

1090
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:33,668
- Oh, shit. (coughing)

1091
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,582
- Oh, poor thing.

1092
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,399
- This was not done for food.

1093
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,779
- No.

1094
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,983
- Need anymore proof?

1095
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,740
We should go back.

1096
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,890
- We made a decision.

1097
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Let's keep movin'.

1098
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:04,985
(flies buzzing)

1099
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:13,890
- [Carmen] Hey, you
guys, hold on a second.

1100
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:15,401
Doug's got something-
- Hold it.

1101
00:54:15,402 --> 00:54:16,235
Girl, I'm okay.

1102
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:17,068
Just go ahead in.

1103
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:17,901
- No, we'll wait.

1104
00:54:17,902 --> 00:54:19,318
- Kyle, it's okay, man.

1105
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:20,152
I just got this rock in my shoe.

1106
00:54:20,152 --> 00:54:21,090
It's driving me crazy.

1107
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,679
I'll catch up.

1108
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,930
- Hey, easy on the water.

1109
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,719
- Kyle, I'm serious, man.

1110
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,720
Go ahead.

1111
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,983
- All right, let's go.

1112
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,670
(demon roaring)

1113
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,088
(soft suspenseful music)

1114
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,528
(demon roaring)

1115
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:49,005
- Fuck.

1116
00:54:49,006 --> 00:54:50,006
This rock.

1117
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:56,450
(tense suspenseful music)
(demon roaring)

1118
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:59,157
(bird cawing)

1119
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:05,387
(tense suspenseful music)
(demon roaring)

1120
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:09,366
(tense suspenseful music)

1121
00:55:14,283 --> 00:55:16,109
- This is stupid.

1122
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,484
We should all stick together.

1123
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:19,718
- [Carmen] Yeah.

1124
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:23,302
(rising suspenseful music)

1125
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:31,984
(demon roaring)

1126
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,820
- Paul?

1127
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:46,821
- Monica?

1128
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,993
- [Doug] Jake?

1129
00:55:48,994 --> 00:55:51,097
- [Tina] Monica?

1130
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,660
- [Doug] Jake? Come on, man.

1131
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:54,661
- Monica?

1132
00:55:57,663 --> 00:55:58,830
Monica? Julie!

1133
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:11,035
Monica?

1134
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:28,175
(demon roaring)
(intense dramatic music)

1135
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:36,279
(tense suspenseful music)

1136
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:42,087
Doug?

1137
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,267
Doug!

1138
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:47,004
Quit joking around. This is not funny!

1139
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,451
Doug?

1140
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:51,929
This isn't funny!

1141
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:53,279
- Carmen! Carmen!

1142
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,167
Where'd you say he was?

1143
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:55,499
- He was right behind me, you guys.

1144
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,306
I swear to god, he was right there!

1145
00:56:57,307 --> 00:56:58,616
- Doug!

1146
00:56:58,617 --> 00:57:01,039
- Oh my god, he's dead.
- Stop it, stop it.

1147
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,716
- I wanna go back. Can we go back?

1148
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:03,550
Can we all go back?
- [Carmen] Doug?

1149
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,383
- It's safer there.

1150
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:05,789
I wanna go back. I'm going back.

1151
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,709
- No, no, no. Listen, we
have to stay together.

1152
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,543
Doug!

1153
00:57:08,544 --> 00:57:10,499
- No, no, no! You don't understand!

1154
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,333
You're not listening to me!

1155
00:57:11,334 --> 00:57:14,579
I wanna go back.
(Doug grunting)

1156
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,659
- She's right.

1157
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,249
Nothing happened to us there last night.

1158
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,677
We should go back!

1159
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:19,889
- Carmen.
- No!

1160
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,629
He talked us into coming out here,

1161
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,999
and you were wrong.

1162
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,659
- We all made the decision.

1163
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,389
- We're safer back at the camp.

1164
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,709
Doug would still be alive.

1165
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,539
Out here, it has too many-

1166
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,257
(demon roaring)
(Doug grunting)

1167
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:33,091
I hate him.

1168
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:34,091
Come on, Lisa, let's go.

1169
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,069
- No, just let 'em go.

1170
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:40,013
Maybe they will be safer back at the camp.

1171
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,233
Let's just keep going.

1172
00:57:43,946 --> 00:57:46,297
- God damn it.

1173
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:51,298
(demon roaring)
(Doug grunting)

1174
00:57:58,132 --> 00:57:59,424
- How much further?

1175
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:02,008
- Well, we've still got a ways.

1176
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:11,172
(demon roaring)
(intense dramatic music)

1177
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:20,399
- I really have to pee.

1178
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,100
- Can't you wait till we get back?

1179
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,380
- [Kyle] These seem pretty fresh.

1180
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:33,397
- [Tina] Yeah.

1181
00:58:33,398 --> 00:58:36,981
- It looks like it's
headed back towards...

1182
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:39,055
Oh, shit!

1183
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:44,992
- I can't hold it anymore.

1184
00:58:44,993 --> 00:58:46,740
- You have to.

1185
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:48,791
- I've been holding it for the last hour.

1186
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,365
- All right, all right.

1187
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,886
Go over there.

1188
00:58:55,887 --> 00:58:59,245
Just do it quickly, okay?
- Okay.

1189
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:02,663
(intense dramatic music)

1190
00:59:04,533 --> 00:59:05,811
- Oh.

1191
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:06,812
- Hurry up!

1192
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:16,013
(demon growling)

1193
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,530
- What was that?
- What?

1194
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:20,232
- I don't know. I thought
I heard something.

1195
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:22,150
- I don't see anything.

1196
00:59:23,308 --> 00:59:26,725
(intense dramatic music)

1197
00:59:30,874 --> 00:59:32,330
(demon roaring)

1198
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,718
What?

1199
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,563
(demon roaring)

1200
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:39,286

(Lisa gasping)

1203
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:57,623
- Which way did it go?

1204
00:59:57,624 --> 00:59:59,381
Stay here. Don't leave.

1205
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:01,909
(Lisa gasping)

1206
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:05,327

(Lisa gasping)

1208
01:00:13,927 --> 01:00:14,927
- Shh. Shh.

1209

(tense suspenseful music)

1210
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:29,085

- Lisa, what are you doing?

1215
01:01:21,642 --> 01:01:22,975
Come here. Lisa!

1216
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:24,859
Shit.

(metal clanging)

1227
01:02:59,774 --> 01:03:00,837
- [Lisa] Paul?

1228
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:01,838
Is that you?

1229
01:03:03,942 --> 01:03:04,942
Hey! Larry?

1230
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,570
It's Lisa.

Hey, you know, we really
do need to stick together.

Lisa!

God damn. Where the hell are they?

1253
01:04:56,847 --> 01:04:58,349
- Are you sure this is the spot?

1254
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,579
- Yeah.

1255
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,580
Shit.

01:06:49,763 --> 01:06:52,989
(demon roaring)

1275
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,304
Where'd you crash?

1276
01:06:55,305 --> 01:06:58,055
(demon roaring)

1277
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:11,058

(footsteps thudding)

1280
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:24,368
Go, go, go, go.

(demon roaring)

1282
01:07:28,651 --> 01:07:32,068
(intense dramatic music)

1283
01:07:52,311 --> 01:07:53,311
Be careful.

1284
01:07:55,016 --> 01:07:56,016
Hold on.

1285
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:59,291
Does any of this look familiar?

1286
01:08:01,808 --> 01:08:03,391
- I don't know, um.

1287
01:08:05,766 --> 01:08:07,623
You know, it all happened so fast.

1288
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,793
I crashed and I flipped, and then Paul.

1289
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,504
It was my fault. (crying)

1290
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:17,639
- Hey, hey, come on.

1291
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,327
There's nothing you
could've done about that.

1292
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,019
- We, we were looking for the others

1293
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,270
in the northeast part
of the woods, you know?

1294
01:08:27,635 --> 01:08:31,289
(Monica sniffling)

1295
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:32,990
They should be somewhere up ahead.

1296
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,119
- Let's hope you're right.

1297
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,020
We need that gas for our plan to work.

1298
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,289
It's time for us to stop being hunted

1299
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,690
and start doing the hunting.

1300
01:08:42,781 --> 01:08:45,698

1303
01:08:51,186 --> 01:08:52,159
- This is it.

1304
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,308
I remember coming through
here, passing under this flag.

1305
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:57,023
- Here, this way.

1306
01:08:57,024 --> 01:09:00,124

1307
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,792

(intense dramatic music)

1309
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:12,370
- There. Is that it?

1310
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:14,371
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1311
01:09:16,082 --> 01:09:21,082
(demon roaring)
(intense dramatic music)

1312
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,333
So how are we gonna get the gas out?

1313
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:28,416
- Can we turn it over?

1314
01:09:28,417 --> 01:09:29,909
- I'll pull the fuel line.

1315
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,206
I'll siphon the gas.

1316
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:35,624

1324
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,257
Come on, come on.

1325
01:10:06,258 --> 01:10:07,499
- A little more. Just a little more.

1326
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,747
- He's coming. Hurry up!

1327
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:10,941
- Isn't that enough?

1328
01:10:10,942 --> 01:10:13,629
- That canteen. Thank you.

1329
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,265

1337
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,743
I need a second to catch my breath.

(demon roaring)

1340
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:20,665
It shouldn't be much further, right?

1341
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,143
- A mile, I think.

1342
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,195
- How much head start you think we got?

1343
01:11:25,196 --> 01:11:26,557
- I don't know.

1344
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:28,715
- So who are we gonna use for bait?

1345
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,116

1351
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:57,345
Come on. We're running out of time.

1352

There's nothing we can do for him.

We gotta get goin'.

1356
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:15,326

What else?

01:14:17,895 --> 01:14:19,646
I'm a sitting duck.

1377
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:22,187
I'm a Woodson University alumni.

Yes, I can feel you coming closer.

1383
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:45,824
This better work.

1384
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:49,236
I hope I hear you coming.

1385
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:52,092
Come and get me.

1386
01:14:52,093 --> 01:14:55,202
I'm all yours, you fucking
ceramic motherfucker.

Maybe I should talk in
Spanish since you're a piñata.

Um, hola. Yo quiero Taco Bell.
