Mikey, we just
need to chat, okay?

6
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,416
Usually, we'd talk to you like
men should talk to a little boy,

7
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:29,420

talk like we're all men.

a scouting promise.

we talk about in here,

okay? Agree?

Sometimes you don't see a thing
coming until it hits ya.

13
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,403
It goes in your ears,
it goes into your heart and

14
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,271
you can feel it hurting
all the way down.

15
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,939
Mikey, you can feel it
hurting all the way down to

16
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,643
your little butt crack,
you feel it,

17
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,378
it's like a punch
to your insides, man.

18
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,210
And you're not expecting this.

19
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,249
It's like a sucker punch.

people that we can depend on.

been sick for a long time,

26
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:20,638
and he's not gonna be around
forever, I know this.

27

to think about this, but,

Goes away forever.

Forever?

34
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:37,559
Is he okay?

35
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:43,431
What? Wait...
Is he dead?

36
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,406

that I was talking about.

00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:45,951
TIBBITS: Wait. We can
go home early?

177
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,951
Yes! Go! All right?

178
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,686
Troop dismissed!

(SLAMMING)

180
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,326
All right, Randy,
take a breath.

181
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,426
This is ridiculous.

182
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,663
I know that camping in the
parking lot is lame, okay,

183
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,398
I know that,
but these moms! It's...

184
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,968
They won't let the kids more
than five miles from the house.

185
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,370
Gary's mom insists he has
at least three bars of

186
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:10,675
cell phone service
and access to a flush toilet.

187
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,011
You know, when Stuart started
this troop, he had 90 Scouts.

188
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:15,844
What about the little
African immigrant?

189
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:17,883
Yeah, what about your nephew?
Why doesn't he come?

190
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,417
My brother's not into it.

191
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,253
Have you showed them
the recruitment video?

192
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,753
I don't want to
show them that video.

193
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:25,157
Randy, first
you sell the kids on this,

194
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,858
then you get the kids to sell the dads.
It's called up-selling.

195
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,092
Double teaming.

196
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,826
EDDIE: You gotta think
like a CEO, man.

197
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,798
We shouldn't have to
show them this video.

198
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,197
They should wanna do it!

199
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,435
Hey, they're kids, man.
You gotta sell them on stuff.

200
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,738
That's how it works. You gotta do
the yickety-yickety-yickety, man.

201
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,340
Or otherwise, I'm gonna
tell you something, Randy,

202
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,109
we might as well just go ahead
and do something else. Okay?

203
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,911
We are taking
my father camping.

204
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,345
Randy. Randy, chill,
all right?

205
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,450
Just take a break, right?
Re-evaluate, man.

206
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:56,320
We're going camping.
We are not abandoning you.

207
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,989
We're going if it's just us
and him in the parking lot!

208
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,860
Right. Right. Right.
So you tell me,

209
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,500
without the boys,
how is that scouting, man?

Would you get the door, Janine?

223
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,363
JANINE: Pretending
you're not here.

224
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,265
I would be rolling around on the

You know what I'm saying?

226
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:44,633
I know exactly
what you're saying.

227
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:47,005
But maybe this was before
computer effects were invented.

228
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,274
Hey, Moses,
you need to knock that

They were all supposed to
go camping this weekend,

I talked their mothers
into this.

242
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,800
It's a much safer choice.

243
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,133
And such a good cause.

244
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,004
Uh, good cause?

This is a really big
step for Leonard.

258

He's never done
anything like this.

259

Oh, he's never been
to a sleepover?

260

No. Honestly,

261
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,470
I can't imagine
having my eyes off him

it just makes me nervous.

to have him

to be tougher, you know?

on to all those guy stuff.

"HD" stands for high-def.

279
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:33,377
We also upgraded to
the triple diamond package.

280
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:37,214
That means we have
over 2,500 channels.

help me out up here!

515
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,643
Tear his toilet off the wall!

516
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,655
He doesn't even have cable.

517
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,557
Randy, I don't think they
want us to camp in there.

518
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,692
Oh, yeah?
Well, today

519
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:59,930
it's not up to them.

520
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,732
Mr. Stevens,
can we pee out here?

521
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:06,870
Yeah. Guys! Nature is
your house, okay?

522
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:07,905
Nature is your toilet.

523
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,339
Pee anywhere you want.
Everybody, pee anywhere.

524
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,142
EDDIE: All right, let me get this straight, man.
So, we're gonna trespass?

525
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:14,278
That's the plan?

526
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,945
Did you see his face?

527
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:18,582
Do you know how long it's
been since I've had this?

528
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,918
Eddie. It's the cops! It's the
nature police! Hey, guys.

529
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,889
I cannot get busted, okay?
What is the matter with you?

530
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,597
Jesus Christ, dude! This is
way beyond Scout protocol.

531
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:34,967
Good morning!

532
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,168
Are you cleaning that up?

533
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,636
Clean what up?

534
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:42,605
If I came to your house

535
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:45,342
with 10 boys and
pissed on your carpet,

536
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,111
you'd want me to clean up,
wouldn't you?

537
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:50,682
Well, what do you expect us to do?
Have 'em whiz in a bucket?

538
00:25:52,682 --> 00:25:56,954
There's restrooms
a half mile up.

539
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,654
You couldn't wait though,
could you?

540
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,392
Well, peeing in the woods,
that's not the...

541
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,626
Nobody pees here!

542
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:05,929
Do you understand me?
This is State property.

543
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:08,698
If you wanna be here,
you be in a public area.

544
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:11,233
We have restrooms, showers.
We have pools...

545
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:14,170
You know what? No, thank you.
We're Scouts,

546
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:17,106
so we will take
our business elsewhere.

547
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:19,308
Business?
Is that what that is?

548
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,179
Is that a business?

549
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:26,383
Hey! This park is not your
goddamned toilet bowl.

550
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,687
If it don't look like a
urinal, don't piss on it!

551
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,155
Do you understand me?

552
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:34,324
Yeah.

553
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:37,298
Let's be
a little bit civilized.

GENTRY: Kirk, let's check
the kitchen, too, man.

561
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,252
Let's see if there are some snacks.
KIRK: Janine!

562
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,055
What'd you get?
Find anything?

563
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,689
What, you think I couldn't
find you cocksuckers?

564
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,424
Who the fuck are you?

565
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,858
Get the fuck outta here!

566
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:11,426
Hey, Mikey!
We're unarmed!

567
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,031
Mikey! Which one of these
assholes is your Scoutmaster?

568
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,333
Which one told you I was dead?

569
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,270
Which one is it, Mikey?

570
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,139
I'm sorry, man. I hope
you can forgive me,

571
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,474
but yesterday I'm at the
hospital

572
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:27,376
gettin' a motherfucking
(WHISPERS) colonoscopy.

573
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:30,212
I don't know if you ever
had one, but it ain't fun.

574
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,481
So I'm tryin' to come home

575
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,316

I don't know

583
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:57,172
Turns out that Mikey gets a visit
from his Scoutmasters at school,

584
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,075
they are armed
with a newspaper.

585
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:01,478
And these dipshits
read my cousin's obituary

586
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,015
and tell Mikey
I'm fuckin' dead!

587

00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:31,508
Sounds like we got
the same ass-kicking agenda.

597

You know what? They sound like
some real shitty fuckers, man.

That is our hunch,
shitty fuckers!

599

That's not a hunch,
that's the truth.

600

And we're gonna hunt 'em down.

601

We just need to know
where to start.

00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,786
What about this, Kirk?

Please. Janine...

00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,356
Good eye, Janine.

605
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,056
This might be what we need.

606
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,892
I think it's exactly
what you need.

607
00:28:49,893 --> 00:28:51,392
Yeah, but do you know
where they're at?

608
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:52,195
Yeah, how do you know?

609
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,163
Well, do you see
the green spot?

610
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:55,398
With the big circle around it?

00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,171
Yeah. That's probably
where he took 'em.

614
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,338
That's out in the woods.

You fuckin' right,
I wanna come with you,

somebody to watch my kids.

That's not a problem.
That's what Janine's for.

All right, guys,

00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:22,050
scouting is a complex
woman, all right?

There's many sides to her,

640
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,489

641
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,393
control, conquer, and slay her?

Does anyone know where
the word "Scout" comes from?

649
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,482
It's a French word and
it means "to listen."

650

In America, that means
"Shut the fuck up," okay?

gonna pledge it our respect.

take a pee-pee break, doesn't it?

pissed around here.

over here, where the tire treads are,

the little footprints are.

they pile back in the van,

866
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:31,902
and they off on the road.

867
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35,106

out, unload, load up, drive out.

Anyway. Hey, Dwande, do me a
favor, bury that, all right?

1531
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,036
Thank you.

1532
01:12:56,037 --> 01:12:58,173
Caldwell, I got shotgun, brah!

1533
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:01,207
Dad.
Yeah?

1534
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:04,208
We should go home.
JANINE: Yeah. Let's get out of here.

1535
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:08,614
KIRK: Okay. Help Dad up.

1536
01:13:08,615 --> 01:13:10,725
(GROANING)

1537
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:21,828
<i>RANDY: Over the tops of these hills
and past the roads and highways,</i>

1538
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:23,667
<i>you can see back
to the neighborhood,</i>

1539
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,734
<i>where men return home
to their wives,</i>

1540
01:13:28,735 --> 01:13:30,173
<i>ready to embrace
the future ahead.</i>

1541
01:13:33,173 --> 01:13:36,477
<i>And not far away,
on the other side of town,</i>

1542
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,710
<i>the parents of these boys</i>

1543
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:39,514
<i>have grown proud of their sons.</i>

1544
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,747
<i>What they've done
and who they've become.</i>

1545
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:43,584
Following the Ten Commandments,

1546
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,153
is the way we should
live our lives every day.

1547
01:13:46,154 --> 01:13:48,121
Come on, guys!

1548
01:13:48,122 --> 01:13:49,923
<i>RANDY: The boys
are becoming men</i>

1549
01:13:49,924 --> 01:13:52,761
<i>that aren't afraid of
seeking out new frontiers,</i>

1550
01:13:54,761 --> 01:13:59,633
<i>while others turn their lives
around and change their old ways.</i>

1551
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,569
It got a little burned.

1552
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,638
Yeah, but it's a nice try.

1553
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:06,742
Thanks, babe.
Thank you.

1554
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:10,548
<i>RANDY: Learning to look toward
a greater, fuller, richer life.</i>

1555
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:16,048
<i>Sharing stories with friends</i>

1556
01:14:16,049 --> 01:14:17,750
<i>and telling them
real adventures</i>

1557
01:14:17,751 --> 01:14:19,622
<i>that they never
thought possible.</i>

1558
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:22,890
<i>You might hear them
talking about</i>

1559
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,259
<i>a Scoutmaster they once had.</i>

1560
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,861
<i>A Scoutmaster
that pushed his Scouts</i>

1561
01:14:27,862 --> 01:14:30,101
<i>to become strong,
courageous, bona fide men.</i>

1562
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:36,838
<i>Because this is scouting</i>

1563
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:40,645
<i>and, damn it, somebody's
got to lead the way.</i>
