1
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,645
Hey, Taryn.

2
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,223
Breakfast is ready!

3
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,695
Ooh, that looks good.

4
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,730
Thanks, hon.

5
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,599
Um... No butter?

6
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,101
You're on a diet.

7
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,836
Oh, right. How could I forget?

8
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,872
Ew. Guys, get a room.

9
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,741
You know, I'd be happy
just to get a waffle.

10
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,543
Have a wonderful first day,
senior.

11
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,878
Thanks, will.

12
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,315
Mom, this looks great. Thanks.

13
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,419
Smile. Mom, lease don't! No!

14
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,755
You ready?

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,325
Yes. I'm just gonna have
a quick breakfast.

16
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,060
No, are you <i>ready, Taryn?</i>

17
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,431
You've got college applications,
s.A.T.S, the prom.

18
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,500
This is going to be
an exciting year.

19
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,502
Well, I'm not holding my breath
for that.

20
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,437
Taryn,
you're a very smart girl.

21
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,272
You just need to focus.

22
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,907
I'm just making sure

23
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,775
you're dotting your I's
and crossing your t's.

24
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,977
That's all. I am, mom.

25
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,512
I'm dotting and I'm crossing.

26
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,082
I also think that you could
spend a little more time

27
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,917
prepping for your s.A.T.S.

28
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,086
Rather than messing around
with your phone.

29
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,121
Do you really need
to follow me online?

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,624
It's my job.
I have to keep tabs on you.

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,960
Mm. Great.

32
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,931
Hey, come by the office today
and say hello.

33
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,566
You'll be at school?

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,068
Yes. They asked for parent
volunteers for first day.

35
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,070
Oh. Lovely.

36
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,274
Oh, don't freak out
when you get your schedule.

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,544
Remember I told you colleges
like interesting electives?

38
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,546
I signed you up for yearbook.

39
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,050
Thanks.

40
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,218
Bye.

41
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,153
Bye.

42
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,168
"Class of..."

43
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,637
Class of awesome.

44
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,273
I was just gonna go
with the school year.

45
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,075
Here you go.
Booked, blurred, digged.

46
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,143
Wouldn't that be "dug"?

47
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,945
Boom. "Class of awesome."

48
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,181
Oh, yeah. So very awesome.

49
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,850
What's wrong? You're not
embracing the awesome.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,752
Just same old.

51
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,187
Your mom? Yeah.

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,123
She's all over me about s.A.T.S
and applications and...

53
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,359
University of michigan? Yes.

54
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:53,131
Sucks, but it'll all be worth it
when we're there together.

55
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,267
How do you feel about christmas lights?
Elena...

56
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,935
I was thinking
we can line our dorm room

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,237
with white christmas lights.

58
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,911
You know, I'm thinking
I'm just gonna try

59
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,273
and get through
the school year first,

60
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,075
hopefully make track team,

61
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,677
maybe come up with a date
for the prom, you know,

62
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,146
before I start thinking
about white christmas lights.

63
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,249
Taryn, we're the dream team,
okay?

64
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,184
We're gonna kill it in college.

65
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm not really killing it
in high school, so...

66
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,822
So use your senior year
to find your bliss.

67
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,791
Did you really
just quote joseph campbell?

68
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,260
You know, your thing.

69
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,961
You know, I am who I am.
I'm kind of a done deal.

70
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,896
So mix it up.

71
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,035
For example, check it.

72
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,970
Do you like it?

73
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,673
Holy crap!

74
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,275
Your hair is blue!

75
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,776
Wow!

76
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,045
You've
really taken nonconformity.

77
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,313
To a whole new level.

78
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,016
Well, you could do the same.

79
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,652
No, I don't think that blue
would suit my complexion.

80
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,887
Well, if you're worried
about being that girl

81
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,623
who always plays it safe,
who never gets into trouble,

82
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,825
who never makes it past
second base...

83
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,927
Third. I've been to third base.

84
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,729
Whatever.

85
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,599
All I'm trying to say is this
is your chance to mix it up.

86
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,234
You want people
to see you different,

87
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,336
you got to <i>be</i> different.

88
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,104
Find your freaking bliss.

89
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,340
And where does one look
for bliss?

90
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,342
Behind you.

91
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,310
Hey! Oh!

92
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,711
I missed you guys.

93
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,812
Hey. Yo.

94
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,247
Nice run this morning, Taryn.

95
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,948
You got fast over the summer.
Oh, thanks.

96
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,983
How was wayland?

97
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,484
Caledonia.

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,689
Nice memory.
Caledonia was boss.

99
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,191
Life-guarding,
horse-riding, decent cabins,

100
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,160
hot girls, cool kids.

101
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,128
I've got some summer pictures
on my phone, too.

102
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,296
Oh. You and rayna?

103
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,899
No. We broke up in july.

104
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,335
You and rayna broke up?

105
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,729
Yeah. It was just time,
you know?

106
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,276
We need to get to homeroom.

107
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,278
Wait. It's not even...

108
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,654
What is wrong with you?

109
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,957
Ryder just told you
that he's finally free.

110
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,159
Why are you running away?
He's into you.

111
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,195
Yeah, into me enough
to talk about

112
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,996
the "hot girls" in caledonia.

113
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,967
He likes me as a friend...
Just a friend.

114
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,069
No. Worse.

115
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,004
He likes me as a guy friend.

116
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,539
Do you think
it's actually possible

117
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,508
that ryder thinks that I'm a guy
with boobs?

118
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,011
Okay, first,
you barely <i>have</i> boobs.

119
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,947
Thanks.

120
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,949
Who's that?

121
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,818
New girl, I guess.

122
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,887
Her name's nina.

123
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,489
She got kicked out
of her last school.

124
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,158
I hear she's crazy
into some hardcore stuff.

125
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,127
Hardcore like an affair
with the principal?

126
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,764
I don't know. I just know it's
weird and it's hardcore. G.P.

127
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,068
Later, courtney.

128
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,103
Seriously...

129
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,405
Don't start.

130
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,473
Why are you nice to her?

131
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,909
Because she matters.

132
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,043
Not to me.

133
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,412
Come on. Let's go to homeroom.

134
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,881
I'll meet you there.

135
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,299
Are you okay?
Do you want me to call 911?

136
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,734
No. Is something...

137
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,537
I'll call 911. I'm... I'm cool.

138
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,106
It's... it's all good.
Just give me a second.

139
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,278
Look, do me a solid, okay?
Don't tell anyone that I was...

140
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,352
What the hell are you doing?

141
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,154
Uh, nina was helping me find
a contact lens.

142
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,256
Nina and you?

143
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,425
Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,994
Well, don't worry
about your contact.

145
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,064
I'm sure mommy has a whole stash
of personal items for you.

146
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah, it's... hi,
there, new girl nina.

147
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,068
I'm courtney,

148
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,437
which you would have found out
by the end of the day anyways,

149
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,573
'cause that's the way it is.

150
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,508
I'm going to offer you
a helpful heads-up.

151
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,109
At this school,

152
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:03,849
being nice gets you
a one-way ticket to g.P.

153
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,283
What do you mean g.P.?

154
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,819
General population.

155
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,455
Nice. It's no big deal.

156
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,059
It's just, like, courtney's
nickname for people who are...

157
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,329
Average, mediocre,
less than 100 followers online.

158
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,366
Look, nina, here's the deal...

159
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,169
People like shiny, new things.

160
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,271
That's you.

161
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,607
You're an asset.

162
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,842
Hang with me,
and you won't have to worry

163
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,544
about climbing
the social ladder.

164
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,146
You'll already be on top.

165
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,288
Jenny? Yes.

166
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,990
Steve?

167
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,425
Taryn, I'm meeting with your mom
at lunch

168
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,394
for the fundraiser
if you want to join us.

169
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,929
Lunch with her mommy?

170
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,598
Sure. Maybe.

171
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,201
And... nina, I assume?

172
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,569
That's me.

173
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,404
Great. Welcome to tec voc.

174
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:03,008
Everyone else, welcome to a
final year of homeroom with me.

175
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,082
Uh, since you all know the drill
by now

176
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,145
and we have 10 minutes
till first period,

177
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,882
anyone want to volunteer to give
nina a quick tour of the school?

178
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,918
I got this, ms. Moore.
Nina and I already talked.

179
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,419
I'll give her the grand tour.

180
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,954
Great.
You girls go ahead and...

181
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,523
Actually, Taryn's going to
give me the grand tour.

182
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,127
What?

183
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,795
I don't know.

184
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,166
Ready, Taryn?

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,235
Yeah.

186
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,318
So, um, the cafeteria
is on the other side of campus,

187
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,954
but, I mean, you'll probably eat
at the sundial.

188
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,589
Oh, is that where you eat?

189
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,892
No. I'm not really invited.

190
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,227
Um, english and also calculus

191
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,930
are in the homerooms
on this floor,

192
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,633
and then one up
is math and science.

193
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,002
Hey, I don't care. Oh, sorry.

194
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,270
No. I just meant

195
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,706
I can figure out classrooms
and stuff by myself.

196
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,176
How about you, you know,
show me the good stuff,

197
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,570
like where to sneak off campus,

198
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,681
which janitor's closets
are left unlocked,

199
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,417
best places to hook up
without getting busted.

200
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,685
I don't really know.

201
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,554
Seriously? And you're a senior?

202
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,026
So, you're from central?

203
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,128
Word gets around.

204
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,098
They didn't kick me out, if
that's what everyone's saying.

205
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,135
Oh. Is that
what everyone's saying?

206
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,604
My mom got a better job...

207
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,508
...which means we got
a better house.

208
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,510
This is supposed to
be a better school,

209
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,847
so here I am,

210
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:53,084
being all better
at the better school.

211
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,253
Cool gym.

212
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,689
So, what do you think?
Do you like it here?

213
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,525
Mm, I wouldn't say that.

214
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,662
Yeah. Feels kind of
like a prison, doesn't it?

215
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,797
But they all feel like that.

216
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,666
Different walls,
but the same message...

217
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,501
Keep your grades up
and your heads down.

218
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,137
Yeah, well, sounds about right.

219
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,407
Good news is that in a year,
none of this will matter.

220
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,012
Why?

221
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,181
Because we'll have escaped,

222
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,384
be the hell out
of this high-school crap.

223
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,819
That's why.

224
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,488
Then why make the prison
even worse?

225
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,692
I mean, courtney could make
your life miserable,

226
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,326
and you don't even know me.

227
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,562
Girls like courtney
are a dime a dozen.

228
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,064
They're at every school.

229
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,565
They're all the same,
and they all suck.

230
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,334
Besides, it was cool of you
not to rat me out

231
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,171
for my little game
in the bathroom.

232
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,473
Well, you know, I'm just glad
that I found you,

233
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,775
because, I mean,
I don't know about at central,

234
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,778
but, I mean, if they found out
you were doing drugs,

235
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,814
they would just...

236
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,583
Uh, what? I'm not into drugs.

237
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,286
Oh. You didn't take something?

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,255
No. Please. That's for people
who want to be out of control,

239
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,591
which is the last thing
that I'm into.

240
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,094
So what are you into?

241
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,697
Maybe I'll tell you sometime.

242
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,604
No. No. She's not going
to chapel hill.

243
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,674
No, she's not going
to syracuse, either.

244
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,845
No, all of those out-of-town
schools are way too expensive.

245
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,215
Yes, I have heard
of scholarships.

246
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,218
But I only got the last
four years alone with her.

247
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,387
I don't... I don't want to send
her hundreds of miles away.

248
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,822
I'm home!

249
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,126
Oh, Taryn's on her way in.
I-I'll talk to you later.

250
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,194
I love you, mom. Bye.

251
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,295
Hi!

252
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,331
Hey.

253
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,333
How'd it go?

254
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,634
Fine.

255
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,302
Really? How was yearbook?

256
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,905
It was fine. Just fine?

257
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,741
I was gonna use that hour
for a study period, mom.

258
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,877
I'm already taking
four a.P. Classes.

259
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,379
I'm not worried about that.
Well, I am.

260
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,381
Well, that's because you always
worry about the small stuff.

261
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,415
You should just worry
about the stuff that matters.

262
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,352
Hey, everyone. Hey.

263
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,587
How are you? I'm good. You?

264
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,556
Good. Fine.

265
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,725
So, how'd it go?

266
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,693
Fine.

267
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,797
That's the third "fine"
I've gotten in five minutes.

268
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,665
Mm-hmm.

269
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,934
Hmm.

270
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,641
Heidi? Taryn?

271
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,242
I'm just trying to help her
figure out her life.

272
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,644
Mom won't back off
trying to ruin my life.

273
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,646
Whoa.
Can I call a truce, please?

274
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,314
I'm going to my room.

275
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,153
What happened?

276
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,588
I don't know.

277
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,796
Yo, Taryn, what's up?

278
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,433
Let me guess... latte?

279
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,108
Decaf. Cool. Give me just a sec.

280
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,939
Hey, Taryn.

281
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,108
Nice to see you
off school property.

282
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,843
Your mom's really easing up.

283
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,646
Yeah, well, shstill
wanted me home for dinner.

284
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,948
You and your parents
eat dinner together?

285
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,783
Yeah, every night without fail.

286
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,419
Seems nice. Yeah, not really.

287
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,687
So, how's it going?

288
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,824
Oh, fine.
Uh, that steve guy asked me out.

289
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,058
No way!

290
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,426
A month and a half into school,

291
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,595
and you're still
the hot, new thing?

292
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,564
People see who you want them
to see.

293
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,232
Yeah, right.

294
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,637
How do you get that to happen?

295
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,539
What's with him?

296
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,674
What do you mean?

297
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,276
Oh, come on. Ryder, right?

298
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,711
You're always drooling over him
like a piece of steak.

299
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,280
No, I'm not.

300
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,181
A piece of chocolate, then.
What's the deal?

301
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,017
We've been friends forever,

302
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:23,187
and I wish that it was
different, but it's just...

303
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,355
Yo, Taryn, drinks.

304
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,093
Stop.

305
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,031
You're pretty, you're funny,
and you're cool.

306
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,866
Just go make him see that.

307
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,267
How?

308
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,502
Take control.

309
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,337
Show him
that there's more to you

310
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,506
than fist bumps and high fives.

311
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,142
Flirt a little.
Connect with him.

312
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,910
Ask him about his day

313
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,345
or tell him something cute
about yours.

314
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,150
Just try it.

315
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,152
Can't hurt, right?

316
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,754
Right.

317
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,628
Decaf latte and a spiced chai
for your friend.

318
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,564
So, how's school?

319
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,966
Cold.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,335
My homeroom heater's jacked up
or something.

321
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,869
Oh, ours is the same way...
Freezing,

322
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,371
and then you go out
into the hallway,

323
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,605
and it's like way too hot.

324
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,876
Yeah. Someone really needs
to fix it.

325
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,279
What?

326
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,215
Are we really talking
about heating systems here?

327
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,785
Hey, ryder. Hey, courtney.
Can I get you a refill?

328
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,190
No. Just wanted to make sure
you got the 411 about my party.

329
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,558
Yeah, I heard. I'll be there.

330
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,127
Cool. Yeah, my parents
are going out of town.

331
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,862
My brother scored a keg.

332
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,366
Everyone's gonna be there,
so, you know... epic.

333
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,838
Oh, I am so sorry.

334
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,240
Am I interrupting
something here?

335
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:52,010
No. I-I was just
gonna go anyway, so...

336
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,848
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,182
You're sorry?

338
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,918
Wait.

339
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,121
Taryn, just wait a second.

340
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,190
Taryn, wait!

341
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,166
Hey, wait. Hold on. She's just
trying to piss you off.

342
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,868
It's fine.

343
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,037
I'm not the kind of girl who
takes the lead. Whatever.

344
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,005
Only because
you've never tried.

345
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,673
I can help you with that.

346
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,911
I appreciate it. Really, I do.
But I can't compete.

347
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,914
I mean,
I can't make ryder like me.

348
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,383
I'm not like courtney,
and I'm not like you, either.

349
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,352
But you could be.

350
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,488
I know a way to get
a little extra shot of mojo,

351
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,726
just a little boost to make you
feel like you can do anything.

352
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,328
What are you talking about?

353
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,398
Have you ever heard
of the choking game?

354
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,068
Yeah.

355
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,804
But, I mean, like...
Let me guess...

356
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,107
Anyone who's ever tried it dies
or ends up brain-dead.

357
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,275
Pretty much.

358
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,043
Yeah, well,
the people who believe that

359
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,712
also think that beer and sex
were invented by satan.

360
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,315
True.

361
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,952
But wasn't there that kid
in ypsilanti who died doing it?

362
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,021
Yeah, well, I mean,
how many people die every day

363
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,356
from getting in a car
or slipping in the shower?

364
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,192
You can make anything
seem dangerous

365
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,061
if you spin it the wrong way.

366
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,231
So you...

367
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,467
Do the choking thing,
like, a lot?

368
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,137
Please. At my last school,
it was bigger than booze.

369
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,706
And you don't have to get
an adult to buy it for you.

370
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,141
You have all the control.

371
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:34,212
Get control of yourself,
get control of your life.

372
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,913
It's the easiest thing
in the world.

373
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,150
Make people see
who you want them to see.

374
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,230
<i>Please come and pick them up</i>
<i>at the front desk.</i>

375
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,760
Oh, heidi,
I forgot to tell you that, uh...

376
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,229
That dinner got bumped
to the 23rd.

377
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,166
Okay. No, wait.
I can't go that night.

378
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
Why not?

379
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,603
There's a seniors' parents
meeting at the school.

380
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,072
Well,
this is my partner dinner.

381
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,975
I think you can miss
one parent/teacher meeting.

382
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,844
No, I really can't.

383
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:42,213
They're going to go over
college applications

384
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,682
and transitions
from high school into college,

385
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,196
and it's just a very important
night for Taryn.

386
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:53,324
Yeah, okay, well,
this is important to me.

387
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,294
Okay. I know.

388
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,197
Heidi, talk to me.

389
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,734
I mean, really talk.

390
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,803
Don't just rattle off
your to-do list.

391
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,405
What's going on?

392
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,607
She's becoming so...
I don't know.

393
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,410
I... she doesn't tell me
anything anymore.

394
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,812
She's almost 18.

395
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,015
Well, she never says anything
at dinner.

396
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,617
She's in and out of the house
so fast.

397
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,985
I'm home!

398
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,054
Hi. Do you want some breakfast?

399
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,455
No, got to get ready
for school.

400
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,557
See what I mean?

401
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,795
She's asking for her space.

402
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,663
Maybe we should give it to her.

403
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:36,667
Well, that's not
my strong suit.

404
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,036
Really? I didn't notice.

405
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,872
You're kidding. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna back off.

406
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,041
I'm sorry.
Can I have that in writing?

407
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,209
Thank you. Write it down.

408
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,644
For now. Write it down.

409
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,979
Okay, fine. I'll write it down.

410
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,748
Heidi is backing off. Mm-hmm.

411
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:16,073
Early much?

412
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,441
I just went to the gym.

413
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,443
I've still got to
get ready, though.

414
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,080
Being a runner must give you
some stellar breath control.

415
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,415
I guess.

416
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,251
Oh, that's right. You go more
for the ryder sightings.

417
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,356
So, um...

418
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,960
With your, uh...
Your choking...

419
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,430
You're interested?

420
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,834
Let's call it "curious."

421
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,837
Great. But I don't want to talk
about it over the phone.

422
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,639
Come over before school.

423
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,013
On my way.

424
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,858
So, you smoke any weed?

425
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,661
It doesn't do much for me.
Maybe I got the wrong kind.

426
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:11,996
What about you?

427
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,497
No, it makes me paranoid,

428
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,633
and I go through
way too many cheetos.

429
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,636
So, do you drink?
Mm, sometimes.

430
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,572
Next time you're at a party,
check out the drunk girls.

431
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,307
They all think they look cool,

432
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,209
but really,
they're stumbling and slurring

433
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,744
and throwing
their boobs around.

434
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,379
That's why
I like flying better.

435
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,581
Just cutting off the oxygen to
your brain for a couple seconds.

436
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,116
Is that all?

437
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,086
Relax.
It's not like you hang yourself.

438
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,688
Look, when you're hungry,
doesn't your body let you know?

439
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,457
Same thing when you're thirsty?

440
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,992
And when you're tired?

441
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,427
My body lets me know.

442
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,795
Think about it.

443
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,263
If you wanted
to commit suicide,

444
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,258
could you physically do it
by holding your breath?

445
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,900
No. Why?

446
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,036
Because I'd pass out.

447
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,237
Before...?

448
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,172
I died. Exactly.

449
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,274
When you need to breathe,
your body lets you know.

450
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,078
It's medical. It's science.
You're in control.

451
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,748
And being that in control,

452
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,550
being able to trust yourself
like that, it's...

453
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,253
It makes you able to have
control anywhere...

454
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,691
School, at home, with ryder.

455
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,627
There's this one girl
I've heard of

456
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,829
who can hold her breath
for like seven minutes.

457
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,998
She's kind of a legend. You can
find her on like all these...

458
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,600
Hi, girls.

459
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,535
Mom, don't you knock?

460
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,036
This is Taryn.

461
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,371
- Hi, Taryn.
- Nice to meet you.

462
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,741
Nina, pink or black?
For my date tonight.

463
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,676
First date or second? First.

464
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,545
Then pink.

465
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,913
Great. Thanks.

466
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,282
I thought you liked the guy
from yesterday.

467
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,351
He was okay.

468
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,053
This one's from
a more elite dating site.

469
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,123
He seems smarter
and definitely cuter.

470
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,260
I stocked up on frozen dinners.

471
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,628
Of course you did.

472
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,430
Don't wait up for me.

473
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,399
Nice to meet you, Taryn.

474
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,236
You guys eat frozen dinners?

475
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,006
What? She buys the good ones.

476
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,775
We'd better get to school.

477
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,881
That's the one good thing
about being in yearbook...

478
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,716
Seniors get a key.

479
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,119
Yeah.
Who needs a janitor's closet?

480
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,155
So, how often is it empty
at lunch like that?

481
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,392
Taryn, where were you?
I couldn't find you.

482
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,894
Hey. Sorry. Uh, we were just...

483
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,963
Working on a school project.

484
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,566
Uh, your hair's looking
really good, elena.

485
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,135
Thanks.

486
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,670
I'll see you later.

487
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,104
Dinner at 6:00? Yeah, great.

488
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,106
Great.

489
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,142
So, yesterday, all "checking in"
to street buzz.

490
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,945
Way to be proactive
on the ryder front.

491
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,646
I was just meeting nina.

492
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,916
New subject... your birthday.
What are we doing for the 1-8?

493
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,418
Sleepover?

494
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,919
Dude...

495
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,554
Sleepover with beer?

496
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,257
This is an important birthday.
You know that, right?

497
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,961
Yeah. Good point.
The age of escape.

498
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,397
I was thinking more along
the lines of the age where...

499
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,565
Taryn, hey.

500
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,100
Hey. Hi.

501
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,669
You bailed in a hurry
last night.

502
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:10,241
Oh, yeah. I-I remembered
I had to go do something.

503
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,443
Oh.

504
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,214
I'm going to class, Taryn.

505
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,218
Wait. I'm coming.

506
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,287
I'll see you.

507
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,260
I'm not much for subtleties,
but that was a thing.

508
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,629
I don't think so.

509
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,967
Ryder is hot, smart, and nice.

510
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,003
Look.

511
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,171
The vultures are swarming.

512
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,075
For real, ask him out already.

513
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,411
I'm not there yet.

514
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,179
Yeah, well,
you'd better work faster

515
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,148
if you want some of that.

516
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,684
I know.

517
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,729
Can I get you girls anything?

518
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,697
We're fine, mom.

519
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,699
Yeah. Thanks again for dinner.

520
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,735
Sure. You're welcome. I'm glad
you could join us, nina.

521
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,637
Yeah, me too.

522
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,706
Mom...

523
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,276
Looks like your mom
is pretty cool.

524
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,613
Yeah, well,
looks can be deceiving.

525
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,448
So you're like a stepford kid?

526
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,651
Everything's all perfect in
here, like from a magazine.

527
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,625
Bet you have something cute

528
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:37,528
in your uber-organized closet
for courtney's party.

529
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,533
Well, I haven't been invited
to courtney's party.

530
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,101
So?

531
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,038
You know ryder's gonna
be there, right?

532
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,042
Do we have to
go over this again?

533
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,079
All you have to do to belong
is act like you belong.

534
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,415
Owning the joint is believing
you own the joint.

535
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,318
I just want
to get out of the joint.

536
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,823
I can get you out for a minute
or two... or even less.

537
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,191
It's your call.

538
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,802
Okay, let's do it.

539
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,405
Only if you want to.

540
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:25,342
I want to.

541
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,678
Great.

542
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,380
So, I'm just gonna put my thumbs
right here...

543
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,482
Sorry, sorry.
I just wasn't ready.

544
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,821
Okay, let's do it.

545
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,257
No.

546
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,159
No?

547
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,229
No.

548
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,431
You don't really seem
like you want to,

549
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,366
and that's totally cool.

550
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,303
Look, I'm not some pushy boy
trying to talk you into sex.

551
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,606
There's no pressure here,
no deadlines.

552
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,441
When you're really ready
to try it, we'll try it.

553
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,510
And if not, no big.

554
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,911
Thank you.

555
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,947
In the meantime,
you can be my wingman!

556
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,883
Here. Come on.

557
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,652
Here.

558
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,093
Don't worry. You won't hurt me.

559
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,895
So how will I know
when to stop?

560
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,663
I'll put my hands
on your wrist.

561
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,899
When I've had enough,
I'll let go.

562
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,368
And when I let go, you let go.

563
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,870
It's my body, so I know
what it's telling me.

564
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,906
You have to trust me. Cool?

565
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,074
Okay.

566
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,608
Trust me.

567
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,312
Unless I drop my hands,
don't let go.

568
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,549
Don't... let... go.

569
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,185
Go.

570
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,722
Am I doing this right?

571
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,558
Nina? Nina?

572
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,762
I-I don't... talk to...

573
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,298
Say something, please, nina.
Nina!

574
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,767
I think I should let go!

575
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,535
I think I should let...
Nina, ta...

576
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,970
I think I should let go!
Nina. Nina?

577
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,576
Nina?

578
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,278
Nina?

579
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,152
Nina?! Nina?!

580
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,054
Oh, my god.

581
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,760
Nina!

582
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,501
Nina!

583
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,776
Holy crap. That was awesome.

584
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,283
What is going on in here?!
I heard screaming.

585
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,851
Mom, nothing! We're fine!

586
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,020
Are you girls sure you're okay?

587
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,088
Mom, we're fine!

588
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,357
Yeah, never better!

589
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,126
I'm sorry. It was
a rocking song on the radio.

590
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,862
I'm sorry we worried you.
It was my bad.

591
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,031
We're fine.

592
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,467
Okay.

593
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,639
Oh, my god, you're a pro!

594
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,707
Really?

595
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,009
That was okay?

596
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,844
That was better than okay!

597
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,647
You were like my parachute,
my safety net.

598
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,948
Because you were doing it,

599
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,950
I could totally go
to that other place.

600
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,585
Normally, I only get a grayout,

601
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,520
but that was a full ride,
total blackout.

602
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,722
You're a rock star!
A rock star?

603
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,558
To you, maybe.

604
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,259
Me now, ryder later.

605
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,830
Act like you believe something,
and everyone else will, too.

606
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,499
Anyway, I better get going.

607
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,134
See you at school!

608
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,402
Good night.

609
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,342
Good night, nina.

610
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,145
Taryn...

611
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,014
What was really
going on in here?

612
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,083
We were just hanging out.

613
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,053
Are you sure?

614
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,155
Yes. Mom...

615
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,257
Come on, tar... mom!

616
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,326
We have a deal, right?

617
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,996
You, me, and only the truth.

618
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,935
Okay. Well...

619
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,605
I like this guy,

620
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:18,642
and he's never really shown
before that he likes me,

621
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:24,414
and so nina said
that I should talk to him.

622
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:28,385
And so I did,
and he sent me a text.

623
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,021
And I got really excited
about it,

624
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,390
and I guess I just...
We were too loud about it.

625
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,626
I'm sorry.

626
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,895
I know it's silly, but...

627
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,700
What?

628
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,106
You just haven't talked to me
that much about boys before.

629
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,241
Track, yes.

630
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,910
Actually...

631
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,711
I think it's really great,

632
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,847
and I'm glad you have a friend
to share it with.

633
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,116
Nina seems like
a really great girl.

634
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,386
Yeah, she is.

635
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,521
Cool.

636
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,998
Here we go with the boys.

637
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,581
Hey. Hey.

638
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,017
I thought you had
something to do today.

639
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:37,854
I do. I did. It's done.

640
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,024
Mysterious much?

641
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,360
Check it.

642
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,295
Someone's favorite indie band
is playing at wilson's chapel.

643
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,631
Oh, my gosh! Greer!
I love them!

644
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,966
Check the date.

645
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
My birthday.

646
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,103
Told you I'd come up with
something cool for us to do.

647
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,105
Wilson's chapel...
Isn't that a bar?

648
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,742
Yep. And that's the other part
of your present.

649
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,311
My cousin is scoring us
fake I.D.S.

650
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,380
Shut up. Right?

651
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,649
Oh, my gosh! You rock.

652
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,385
Thank you. And yeah, I do.

653
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,588
Is that a new shirt?

654
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,824
Yeah. It's, uh... it's nina's.

655
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,494
What's that?

656
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,530
Uh, youth hostels in europe.

657
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,366
Don't tell me
you're actually considering

658
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,001
that gap-year thing.

659
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,337
I'm actually considering
the gap-year thing.

660
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,407
We had plans.

661
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,843
No.

662
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,312
You had plans, elena, and...

663
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,484
I'm still trying
to figure mine out.

664
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:45,455
What about our kick-ass
dorm room at u of m?

665
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,557
Do you want
to escape that, too?

666
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,894
I think that I need to see more
before I can make a decision.

667
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,497
Maybe travel is my bliss.

668
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,667
Maybe crazy is your bliss.

669
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,203
Ask him out already.

670
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,049
Hey. How's it going?

671
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,186
Good. Hi. What's that?
Medical terminology?

672
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,688
Yeah, I'm just trying to get ahead
of the game for college next year.

673
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,025
Oh. I thought you were going
for a football scholarship.

674
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,395
No. I'm gonna be premed.

675
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,997
Oh.

676
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,834
Have you forgotten how you and I
used to nerd out together?

677
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,969
No, I just...

678
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,438
Now you do football.

679
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,140
Yeah, and now you wear contacts.
We're still the same people.

680
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,243
Well, not completely.
I'm not a latchkey kid anymore.

681
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,280
Well, I still am, only
I don't spend every afternoon

682
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,194
in your basement playing
video games these days.

683
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,219
Which means I'm still
reigning champion.

684
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,088
You wish! I won the last game.

685
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,756
Right.

686
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,292
Oh, you're making me miss
my empty house.

687
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,729
Now my mom is home all the time.
Seriously all the time.

688
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,998
Well, maybe I could talk
to your mom

689
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,067
about leaving the house
more often.

690
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,375
It's rayna.

691
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,945
I thought you guys broke up.

692
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,681
She texted me, asking to talk.

693
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,617
Go ahead.

694
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,053
I can call her later.

695
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,022
Oh, it's cool.
You should talk to her.

696
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,357
You want me to talk to her?

697
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,226
Well, I mean,

698
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,230
if you want to talk to her,
you should talk to her.

699
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:46,143
Hey, rayna. No, you're not
interrupting anything.

700
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,847
Hey.

701
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,215
I'm ready.

702
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,317
Cool. Meet me before homeroom
tomorrow, okay?

703
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,692
There's something fun about
risky public behavior, you know?

704
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,327
I do know.

705
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,229
So, you're sure you're ready?

706
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,832
To grow some balls? Yeah.

707
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,567
I am ready.

708
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,703
Good. Because I'm not
going to touch you.

709
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,138
What?

710
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,543
This is about you,
you trusting yourself.

711
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,078
Feel this?

712
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,681
That's all the power you need.

713
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,850
Right here.

714
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,286
It's yours.

715
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,797
Ready?

716
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,401
Go.

717
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,136
Keep holding.

718
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,805
You've got this, Taryn.
Keep holding on.

719
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,574
Don't give up.
You're so strong.

720
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,375
You're stronger
than you think you are.

721
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,578
Keep going, Taryn!
Keep going, keep going!

722
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,913
You are stronger than you think
you are. Keep going!

723
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,848
Keep pushing for it!

724
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,483
Keep going, keep going,
keep going!

725
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,006
Taryn?

726
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,411
Taryn?

727
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,117
Hey. How are you?

728
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,794
Amazing.

729
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,766
That was amazing.

730
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,970
Oh... my... god.
You guys are so busted.

731
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,318
Hey, I got your text.
What's wrong?

732
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,954
I saw courtney talking
to ms. Moore.

733
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,790
Hey, it's okay. Relax.
I can't relax.

734
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,759
If my mom finds out about
what we were doing...

735
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,995
...she will freak out.

736
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,097
She won't get
that it's not a big deal.

737
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,934
And then I-I'll have to forget
about my car and track team and...

738
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,249
Hey, no one's freaking.

739
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,004
Courtney's probably
just talking to her

740
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,639
about school or something.

741
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,174
Yeah, right.

742
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,777
Maybe she's sucking up
to get better grades.

743
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,745
Who the hell knows?

744
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:40,850
Better get to class.

745
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,621
Why?

746
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,893
You mean here?

747
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,562
Concrete floor
is too dangerous.

748
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,497
Don't worry.
We'll find somewhere better.

749
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,801
Besides, do you really want
to go sit in calculus?

750
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,572
Okay, anyone whose butt
is not in their chair right now.

751
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,375
Is officially late.

752
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,346
Um, okay, guys, I looked over
your pop quizzes

753
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,083
from last week,
and not super-impressive...

754
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,105
All better?

755
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,342
Yeah.

756
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,218
Come on. Let's go.

757
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,719
You're kind of a natural at it.
You know that, right?

758
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,721
Must be all the running
or something.

759
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:54,691
You see how when you come
close to the edge,

760
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,294
you just don't care about
all that stupid crap anymore?

761
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,065
If courtney narcs us out,
we'll just say she's lying.

762
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,434
There's no proof,
and it's two against one.

763
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,503
Act like you believe it.

764
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,305
I've got something for you.

765
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,841
What is it?

766
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,577
A couple cool websites.

767
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,679
But check them out later
when you're alone.

768
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,449
Websites for...

769
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,752
Yeah. And not
the "you're gonna die" kind.

770
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,707
These are underground websites.

771
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,122
You have tbe invited

772
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,824
through special hidden links
to get there.

773
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,559
Ooh, clandestine.

774
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,495
Totally not
"general population."

775
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,372
Oh, my gosh, Taryn.
This is so amazing.

776
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,775
Right on time.
What did I tell you?

777
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,378
See? You worry too much
sometimes.

778
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:50,814
Incoming. Go for it.

779
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,016
Now that you're not
a pansy anymore.

780
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,085
Hey, Taryn. You look great.

781
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,588
You sound surprised. Come on.

782
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,557
You know I've always thought
you're pretty.

783
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,059
You just amped it up a notch
or something.

784
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,360
Thank you.

785
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,963
Are you going to courtney's party?
Why?

786
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,532
Because I'm going. It would
be cool to see you there.

787
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,235
I can't.
I have this thing with elena.

788
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,170
Could you get out of it?

789
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,405
I wish.

790
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,253
Missed you at lunch.

791
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,422
I ate at the sundial.

792
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,923
Oh.

793
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,191
Hey, what are you up...

794
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,960
Oh, it's nothing.

795
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,797
It's just a social-networking
site. It's no big deal.

796
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,200
I've got something
that <i>is</i> a big deal.

797
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,035
Check this.

798
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,738
Cool.

799
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,674
"Cool"? Did you even see it?

800
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,911
Yeah. I said it's cool.

801
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,580
What the hell?

802
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,182
What?

803
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,585
I just scored you a fake I.D...
A really good fake I.D.

804
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,654
You don't even care?

805
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,356
Let me guess.

806
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,924
Nina can get you a better one
or something?

807
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,359
What are you talking about?

808
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,860
And what does nina
have to do with this?

809
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,428
I don't know.
It just seems like nina

810
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,598
has something to do
with everything these days.

811
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,768
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that I
wasn't allowed to have other friends.

812
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,171
I didn't say that.
That's not what I...

813
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,841
Are you high?!

814
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,111
No. God, what are you, my mom?

815
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,426
Dude, your eyes are all red.

816
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,351
Yeah, because I was up late,
filling out applications. Happy?

817
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,988
No, actually, I'm not happy.
And I'm not buying it.

818
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,356
You're not being yourself.

819
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,592
Well, maybe this is myself.
Maybe I found my bliss.

820
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:45,562
I mean, isn't that what you wanted
me to do in the first place?

821
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:49,032
This isn't your bliss.
This is <i>her</i> bliss.

822
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,302
God, you're acting so weird.

823
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,939
That is priceless,
coming from you.

824
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,341
What's that supposed to mean...
Coming from me?

825
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,276
Well, I know you get off
on being all,

826
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,245
like, anti-establishment
and whatever,

827
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,547
but that is not the way
to make friends.

828
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,250
You know, when you act
all like... like what?

829
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,118
Like the blue hair

830
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,188
and the whole
"I don't conform" thing.

831
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,857
I mean, you're really
not doing yourself any favors.

832
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,926
You mean when I'm myself?

833
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,398
I'm going to go do
something alternative,

834
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,301
like hang out with people
who don't suck.

835
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,743
Hey, hon.

836
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,012
Dinner's almost ready. Cool.

837
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,747
Oh, speaking of,

838
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,650
where would you like to go
for your birthday dinner?

839
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:41,951
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anywhere you want...

840
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,386
The most expensive place
you can imagine.

841
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,754
You know what? Bankrupt us.

842
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,456
I don't really want to think
about it right now.

843
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,524
Well, we know you have plans
with elena that night,

844
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,259
so we'll just take you out
the next night.

845
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,096
Um, I'm not sure
if I have plans anymore, so...

846
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,598
Oh, really? Why not?
Nothing. It's just...

847
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,433
I don't know.

848
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,468
What is that?

849
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,471
It's nothing.

850
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,172
Is that a hickey?

851
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,141
Mom, do you have to
be so nosey?!

852
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,010
Honey, just give her a second.

853
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,213
What? I am her mother.
I have a right to...

854
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,982
To what?! To invade my privacy
all the time?! No, you don't!

855
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,084
Okay, you don't get to talk
to me like that.

856
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,186
So now you're gonna tell me
how to talk, too?!

857
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,321
Taryn.

858
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,590
That's it. Keys.

859
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,858
What?! Now!

860
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,326
But I didn't do anything!

861
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,594
Now!

862
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,062
Fine!

863
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:27,330
God!

864
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,034
Car is a privilege,
not a right.

865
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,503
Damn it.

866
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,271
You need to calm down, honey.

867
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,906
I mean, Taryn's
a responsible kid.

868
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,641
She's gonna start dating
at some point.

869
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,276
Maybe it's now.
Maybe it's in college.

870
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,944
It's not about that.

871
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,148
It's about her thinking it's
okay to talk to me like that.

872
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,749
Yeah, it's called hormones.

873
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,284
It's more than that.

874
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,920
She has a whole different
attitude.

875
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,856
It doesn't mean anything.
All teenagers act like that.

876
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,992
My daughter doesn't.

877
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,697
Well, clearly she does.
She's not perfect.

878
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:01,764
I know that.

879
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,599
Do you?

880
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,868
Because you don't always act
like you do.

881
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,438
When did you get to be
such an expert on kids?

882
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,907
I think I know enough.

883
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,043
She's my daughter, will,

884
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:17,313
and I know that something
is going on with her.

885
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,982
I'm gonna go search her car.

886
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,609
Hey.

887
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,746
Afterglow is good, huh?

888
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,249
Totally.

889
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,718
What a rush.

890
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,020
Gets your mind off school
for a little while, huh?

891
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,023
But I'm still worried that
courtney's gonna narc us out.

892
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,992
Oh, stop ruining the moment.

893
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,794
I am telling you,
we're covered.

894
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:06,763
Oh, hey!
I just sent you a cool link.

895
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,431
Open it up on a bigger screen.

896
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,338
Okay, hold on.
I'll just put you on speaker.

897
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,516
Do you got it?

898
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,070
"You have been invited
to play the game."

899
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,223
Yeah.

900
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,794
So, what am I looking at?

901
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,629
See the green dot?

902
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,664
That's you
in your neighborhood.

903
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,700
Click on it.

904
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,570
So, all the other dots are...?

905
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:48,871
People playing nearby.

906
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,008
See anyone you know?

907
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,847
Bryce from school.

908
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,882
No way.
Is he playing right now?

909
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,851
Naughty boy.

910
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,556
No, check out summit street.

911
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,425
There you are.

912
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,660
Cool, right?

913
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:11,894
Yeah, totally cool.

914
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,490
Okay, I'm out. See you later.

915
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,932
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

916
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,869
What's going on?

917
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,172
Taryn, we need to talk.

918
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,940
We know what's happening.

919
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,843
What do you mean?

920
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,812
You...

921
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,981
Turned 18.

922
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,784
Happy birthday!

923
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,887
Thanks, guys.

924
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,989
What happened in here?

925
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,792
Uh, never mind, never mind.
Happy birthday, Taryn.

926
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,494
Happy birthday, honey.

927
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:19,929
I'm going to the bathroom.

928
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,264
Oh, here.

929
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,374
Hey, hey.
What the hell are you doing?

930
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,343
I-I acted calm, didn't I?

931
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,647
Heidi,
what are you looking for?

932
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,115
I don't know.

933
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,651
If I knew what I was looking
for, I'd know where to look.

934
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,753
You look in there.
Heidi, stop it.

935
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,888
You're not gonna find anything.

936
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,323
She's acting like a teenager.

937
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,858
Between high school
and her hormones,

938
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:49,692
it's a wonder she's still
on her feet.

939
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,594
Give her a break.

940
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:54,196
We're talking about a kid who's
never even been in detention.

941
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,500
Stop it. Put it down right now.
Put it down.

942
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,639
I just... Look at this room.

943
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,441
We're talking about a girl

944
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,711
who's been a neat freak
her whole life.

945
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,213
And... and... and look at this.
Do you see what I mean?

946
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,316
And now...
Please, just stop it.

947
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,884
Please.

948
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,988
I just have a feeling
something is off.

949
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,923
Okay.

950
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,824
Why weren't you in homeroom?

951
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,476
I had better things to do,
I guess.

952
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:45,448
Right. Looking up youth hostels
in liechtenstein or whatever.

953
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,984
Taryn, we need to talk.

954
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,425
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

955
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,261
Wait. What?
You still want to go?

956
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,263
I'm not so alternative

957
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,733
that I abandon my friends
on their birthday.

958
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,709
Where were you?

959
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,411
I was feeling sick.

960
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,747
Um, but I wanted
to drop this off.

961
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,982
I know it's a few days late.
Why are you doing this?

962
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,988
Taryn, consider this
your opportunity

963
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,523
to have a conversation with me

964
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,960
before I have to get
your parents involved.

965
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,395
Okay.

966
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:35,464
So talk. What's going on?

967
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,601
I'm not sure.

968
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,403
Look, I know your class load
is heavy,

969
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,538
but you've always been able
to handle it before.

970
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:43,639
Now, what is this about?

971
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,274
You failed my test last week,

972
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,843
and now I'm getting grades
from your other teachers...

973
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,346
Low c's, high d's?
Taryn, this isn't you.

974
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,783
I know. I'm sorry. I just...
I've got a lot going on.

975
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,351
Well, you need
to pull it together,

976
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,385
'cause you know there's
not gonna be any track team

977
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,654
with this gpa, right?

978
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,823
Okay.

979
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,059
You've always been
a good student, Taryn.

980
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,428
Don't let it slide now,
when you're so close to the end.

981
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,963
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

982
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,784
No freaking way.

983
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,222
My mother knows
my locker combination?

984
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,862
Can you stop?!

985
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,565
Do you have the ability
to just stop?

986
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,600
What are you talking about?

987
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,870
Everything.
I'm talking about all of it!

988
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,739
Can you stop trying to live
for me and stay out of my life?!

989
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,741
You need to settle down.

990
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,145
Well, you need to stop invading my
privacy and leave my stuff alone!

991
00:51:56,179 --> 00:52:00,015
Well I let things go
as long as I could,

992
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,452
but there's only so long
you can act this oddly

993
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,422
without, you know,
expecting something to change.

994
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,491
I went through your bedroom
because you...

995
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,727
What?!
You went through my room?

996
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,629
Yeah. Your bedroom
is in my house.

997
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,164
But it's my bedroom.

998
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,267
Under my roof, my rules.
Oh, my god!

999
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,736
You need to butt out
and get a life!

1000
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,671
Seriously, I can't go
a single day

1001
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,207
without you trying
to get in the way somehow.

1002
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,943
What, would you rather have a
mother who's not around at all?

1003
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,580
Yes. That would be amazing.

1004
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,419
You know,
I've actually changed, mom.

1005
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,255
My life is getting better.

1006
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,458
Well, you don't seem
all that happy to me.

1007
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,094
Are you angry with me because
I've been trying to help you?

1008
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,562
I'm upset with you

1009
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,298
because you're always
trying to live for me.

1010
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,901
I-I'm just trying to help you.

1011
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:55,838
Can you please just find a hobby
or an activity or anything?

1012
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,274
Just come up with anything,
seriously.

1013
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:02,044
Come up with anything
that doesn't involve me.

1014
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,579
You need to get a life

1015
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,015
so that you'll stop trying
to live mine for me.

1016
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,120
And don't wait up. Taryn...

1017
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,888
Elena's taking me out
for my birthday,

1018
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,390
which you've
pretty much ruined.

1019
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,137
Don't tell me.
You changed your mind?

1020
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,073
No, but I need you to pick me up
from somewhere else.

1021
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,841
Not at your house?

1022
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,278
No. Definitely not at my house.

1023
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,547
Let me guess... nina's?

1024
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,749
Is that a problem?

1025
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,552
Yeah. I'm not picking you up
at nina's.

1026
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,521
She has a car.
She can drive you.

1027
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,990
Fine. Whatever.
I'll see you there.

1028
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,959
Fine.

1029
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,947
Thanks for picking me up.

1030
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,550
Not a problem.

1031
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:18,053
Sorry about your mom...
And elena.

1032
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,022
Yeah, well, this is
pretty much turning

1033
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,157
into, like,
the worst birthday ever.

1034
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,727
Hey. You're in control now.

1035
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,229
If you don't like the way things
are going, you can change it.

1036
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,966
True, but I just don't know
where to start.

1037
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,535
Yes, you do.

1038
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,437
We'll, uh, have
a little private party

1039
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,839
before we go to courtney's.

1040
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,907
I'm not going to courtney's
party, remember?

1041
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,609
I'm meeting elena
at wilson's chapel.

1042
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,446
No worries! I'll get you there
on time, I promise.

1043
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,348
Come on.

1044
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,418
We'll just go there for a little
while, make an appearance.

1045
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,789
Courtney is, like, the last
person I want to see right now.

1046
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,591
Well, we're not going
for courtney.

1047
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,693
Come on.
You're gonna look so hot,

1048
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,862
ryder won't know what hit him.

1049
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,031
In this? I don't think so.

1050
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:06,035
I've got the perfect outfit,
and it's yours.

1051
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,103
Consider it
my birthday present.

1052
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,972
Thanks.

1053
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,108
Come on.
We'd better get started.

1054
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,881
Holy hell.
You almost went three minutes.

1055
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,151
Yeah, well,
my teacher kind of kicks ass!

1056
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:25,354
Just wait. You'll end up like one
of those legendary breath girls.

1057
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:27,323
Yeah, screw everything.

1058
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,958
Screw my grades. Screw my mom.

1059
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,294
Screw it all.

1060
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,829
Especially screw your grades.

1061
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,798
You are so far ahead
of the finish line,

1062
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,333
you can afford
to relax a little.

1063
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,702
And how about this
for a birthday?

1064
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,103
This is not g.P.

1065
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,939
You are not g.P. Anymore,
not looking like that.

1066
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,207
Thanks to your wardrobe.

1067
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,601
That's not it. You belong here.

1068
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,714
And you know what I think?
I think tonight's the night.

1069
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,148
The night?

1070
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,585
<i>The</i> night for you and ryder.

1071
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:57,820
I don't know.

1072
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,922
All right. Come on.

1073
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,557
Wait. Where are we going?

1074
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,992
Just to find an empty room,
have a little shot of fun...

1075
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,161
Just a little
confidence booster.

1076
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,930
Okay, but I'm going first.

1077
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,531
Absolutely.

1078
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,174
Love the outfit.

1079
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,643
Too bad it's so last season.

1080
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:24,213
Keep drinking!

1081
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,748
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1082
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,583
You'll follow your mom
to rehab.

1083
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,257
G.P. Alert. Get him out.

1084
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,598
Come on. Let's do this.

1085
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,099
You do this.

1086
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,101
Right, 'cause you'd hate it
if we did it together?

1087
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,805
Hey.

1088
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,241
Taryn, I thought you had
something to do tonight.

1089
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,943
I do have something to do.

1090
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,812
Follow me.

1091
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,781
O-kay.

1092
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,751
Where are we going?

1093
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,787
Come on. It's, uh...

1094
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,557
Let's go over here. Whoa.

1095
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,799
Okay, this is a little... whoa.
What are you doing?

1096
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,734
Shut up.

1097
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,840
Okay. Whoa. Are you drunk?

1098
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,576
No. Come on!
What are you doing? Stop.

1099
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,811
Don't you want this?

1100
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:31,280
Taryn, I'm serious. Stop.

1101
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,781
What's wrong with you?

1102
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,316
Come on. Ryder.

1103
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,752
Stop.

1104
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,188
I thought you wanted this.

1105
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,591
Who <i>are</i> you?

1106
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,938
Don't worry.

1107
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,773
By tomorrow,
he'll be kicking himself

1108
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,247
for not taking you up
on your offer.

1109
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,244
Ahh.

1110
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,214
Yeah, but he looked so...

1111
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,216
Hey, courtney. Great party.

1112
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,051
Better than the ones
at your old school?

1113
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,887
Almost the same...
Music, a keg, dancing,

1114
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,523
by midnight somebody yakking
on the carpet.

1115
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,726
Well, at least this one's free
of general pop.

1116
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,362
Really, courtney?

1117
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,731
Still with your
general-population crap?

1118
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,266
What are you...

1119
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,401
So what if you caught us
under the bleachers?

1120
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,004
You know, what we were doing
was not generation population,

1121
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,639
and that is something that you,

1122
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,842
with your bitchiness
and your queen bee,

1123
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,397
you would not even have
the balls to...

1124
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,145
Okay. Hold on.

1125
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,016
Taryn, chill.
I-I wasn't talking about you.

1126
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:46,054
The bleachers...
I'm cool with it.

1127
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,190
Sometimes I do it with nick.

1128
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,424
You do?

1129
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,227
Yeah. It's not like
you invented choking.

1130
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,365
I just didn't know
you were into it.

1131
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,401
I didn't actually bust you,
did I?

1132
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,903
Are you kidding me?!

1133
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,105
I thought when nina tagged you
in her "check in,"

1134
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,973
she was just messing around.

1135
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,343
But, no, you actually blew me
off for this stupid-ass party.

1136
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,947
Okay, freak. So not worth it.

1137
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,715
Taryn's a big girl.
She can handle it.

1138
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,817
Come on. Let's go do our thing.
I'll spot you.

1139
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,653
Thanks. Last time I flew,

1140
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,022
I fell,
almost cracked my head open.

1141
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,157
Tell me about it.

1142
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,826
Elena, I'm so sorry. I was just
coming here first, and...

1143
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,028
Who <i>are</i> you?

1144
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,664
My Taryn doesn't come
to stupid parties

1145
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,266
with stupid people
and blow me off.

1146
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:36,638
I don't know why I'm even trying
to stay friends with you.

1147
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,874
God. Why did I think
it was a good idea

1148
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,342
for us to be roommates?

1149
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,077
We are not gonna be roommates.
I know.

1150
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,879
You're screwing around europe.

1151
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,349
No. It's not just that, okay?

1152
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:48,684
I blew my s.A.T.S.

1153
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,953
I did not just whiff them.
I blew them.

1154
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,855
And I'm not filling out
an application

1155
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,757
for university of michigan,

1156
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,827
because even if I get in,
I don't even want to go there!

1157
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,863
'Cause I don't know what I want
to do or where I want to go.

1158
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,498
It might not even be college.

1159
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,201
But it's gonna be
my own choice,

1160
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,037
and I'm gonna live my own life
no matter what!

1161
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,737
Great party, courtney!

1162
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,705
Thanks, courtney!
See you monday!

1163
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,208
Taryn, hey.

1164
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,812
What gives?

1165
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,482
First, you jump me,
and then you avoid me,

1166
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:56,051
and now you're trying to sneak
out of courtney's house?

1167
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,352
Just leave me alone, okay?

1168
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,521
I don't understand.

1169
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,257
You used to be funny,
and you used to be normal.

1170
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,127
You never used to
look like <i>this.</i>

1171
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,496
I've changed.

1172
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,999
Yeah. For the worse.

1173
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:15,337
Where's the girl I liked,
the one I gave that cupcake to?

1174
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,175
You gave me that cupcake?

1175
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,477
Who else would it be?

1176
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:28,350
Why do you think rayna and I
even broke up?

1177
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,385
What do you mean?

1178
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,290
Because all I ever did
was talk about you.

1179
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,028
You did?

1180
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,698
It doesn't matter now, Taryn,

1181
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,052
because you're not that girl
anymore.

1182
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:16,098
Get in.

1183
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,370
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you.

1184
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,606
You could have told me
you were leaving.

1185
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,808
I don't need to run
everything by you.

1186
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,810
Hey, what's with the attitude?

1187
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,680
Is this about elena? You need
to get over her already.

1188
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,983
It's not just elena, okay?

1189
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,486
Your thing with ryder?
Whatever.

1190
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,155
So he's the kind of guy who
can't handle a strong chick.

1191
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,390
You don't want a guy like that.

1192
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,427
He's exactly the guy I want,

1193
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:46,828
and

1194
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,731
that's why I did all of this
in the first place.

1195
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,899
Fine. Then we'll go
play the game,

1196
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,333
and we'll figure out
how to get him.

1197
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,770
We just did that.

1198
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,039
So, what,
you're just gonna give up?

1199
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,210
I don't know. I just...

1200
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:05,447
In case you forgot,
you used to live in loserville

1201
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,049
with your pretty bedroom
and your perfect mom

1202
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,985
and your zero social life.

1203
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,320
People used to call you
"general population."

1204
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,524
Now you get to go to actual
parties, like a real person.

1205
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,593
Wait, Taryn.

1206
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,430
Look, some people just can't
roll with change, okay?

1207
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,333
You should be thanking me for
showing you a way to escape.

1208
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,769
Thanking you?

1209
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,339
I don't even want to be
around you right now.

1210
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,921
I know, I know,

1211
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,924
but she's never
just not come home before.

1212
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,960
You drove by the school, right?

1213
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:29,264
What about the track at the gym?
Maybe she went for a run.

1214
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,999
No.

1215
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,901
No, no.

1216
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,455
Elena's not answering her phone.
No one's answering their phone.

1217
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,008
Hold on.

1218
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,979
Are you okay?

1219
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,314
Yeah.

1220
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,384
She's here. Please come home.

1221
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,054
I'll just assume that
I'm grounded or whatever.

1222
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:58,026
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

1223
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,895
I was at a party.

1224
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,696
With elena?

1225
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,798
She was there, yeah.

1226
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,600
Really?

1227
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,703
Because elena called here
last night three times

1228
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,238
looking for you.

1229
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,793
Well, she was there
eventually, okay?

1230
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,811
No, it's not okay.
None of this is okay.

1231
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,847
And, yes, you are
definitely grounded,

1232
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,883
and there are going to be
a lot of changes around here.

1233
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,551
I don't care if you're 18.

1234
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,755
Fantastic. More change.

1235
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:33,628
Taryn, talk to me.

1236
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,730
I'm fine.

1237
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,466
No, you are not.

1238
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,502
Yeah, well, it's senior year.

1239
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:41,803
I mean

1240
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,472
everything's supposed to
be angsty and different.

1241
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,342
I know.

1242
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,978
But <i>you</i> seem different.

1243
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,414
Look at me.

1244
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,949
I'm listening.

1245
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:57,619
Talk to me, please.

1246
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,889
You can tell me. It'll be okay.

1247
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,326
Whatever it is, it'll be okay.

1248
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,268
Everyone's mad at me,

1249
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,703
and they're right.

1250
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:18,139
And then I try to change things,
and nothing's working.

1251
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:23,111
Well, you're... you're 18.
You're barely 18.

1252
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,580
You're not supposed to have
everything all figured out.

1253
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:28,094
But you make it
seem like I have to.

1254
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,862
Will you come sit down with me?

1255
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,869
Taryn, please,
come and sit down.

1256
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,545
After your dad died,

1257
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,482
I hated

1258
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,786
that you had to come home alone
after school every day.

1259
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,157
I-I-I just couldn't stand
that you were so young

1260
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,625
and you knew how to use a key

1261
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,995
and the microwave
and the washing machine.

1262
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,297
And when will and I got married

1263
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,934
and he offered to let me
take a break from working,

1264
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,336
all that guilt went away,

1265
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:25,940
and I was able to focus on you.

1266
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,810
I guess I did that
a little too much, huh?

1267
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,613
Well,
I'm sorry that I told you.

1268
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,816
That you needed to get a life.

1269
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,751
I get it.

1270
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:41,456
You need your own life, right?

1271
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:47,796
Taryn, things change.

1272
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:52,267
And since they do,
they can change again.

1273
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,607
I'm just glad she's okay.

1274
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,910
And I'm glad we finally talked,
got things out in the open.

1275
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,156
How you doing?

1276
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,291
Not too good.

1277
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,293
I messed up.

1278
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,861
Yep.

1279
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:31,833
No, I mean, I also had
a fight with nina,

1280
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,669
and I just want to make...

1281
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,404
I just want
to make things better.

1282
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:38,206
I really think that it's time

1283
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,277
that I started to try
to make things right.

1284
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:46,047
So, what do you want
to do about it?

1285
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,815
Why don't you give her a call?

1286
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,351
I tried, but she didn't answer.

1287
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,188
I don't think that she wants
to talk to me right now.

1288
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:00,328
Well, that's your decision.

1289
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,932
What?

1290
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,175
Really?

1291
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,312
45 minutes.

1292
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,986
Thank you.

1293
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:43,665
Well, she looks rough.

1294
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,768
Guess that's not surprising.

1295
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,642
How are you?

1296
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,329
Just so you know...

1297
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,397
I'm scared.

1298
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,668
You're never scared.

1299
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,404
I'm always scared.

1300
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,707
I'm just...

1301
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:28,101
Better than you at faking it.

1302
01:12:29,411 --> 01:12:32,280
That's why I wanted you
to come to michigan with me.

1303
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,618
I'm scared to be by myself.

1304
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:40,955
I'm scared to start over.

1305
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,395
All I want to do is start over.

1306
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,831
I'm sorry.

1307
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:53,968
You're gonna be fine, you know?

1308
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,306
Wherever you end up going.

1309
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,077
Will we be fine?

1310
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,550
Eventually.

1311
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:23,865
Hey, Taryn...

1312
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:28,770
You know when I told you that
you should follow your bliss?

1313
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,005
I didn't mean...

1314
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,580
I know.

1315
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,085
You should keep looking for it.

1316
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:57,098
Watch it.

1317
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,667
We're back to that? Nice.

1318
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,006
Seriously?

1319
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,607
After what happened to nina?

1320
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:10,411
Nina was stupid.

1321
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,979
She thought she was in control,
but she wasn't.

1322
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:13,481
And you are?

1323
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,050
I'm not nina, okay? I'm smart.

1324
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,653
Nina was smart, too, you know?

1325
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:23,057
Yeah, well, not everyone
who chokes ends up like nina.

1326
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,862
Bye, Taryn.

1327
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:30,031
Courtney...

1328
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,670
I'm around.

1329
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,739
Just so you know...

1330
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:40,708
I'm around.

1331
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,130
Thanks for coming.

1332
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,132
I just figured that if I drove

1333
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:09,470
that I would keep going
and I wouldn't stop.

1334
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,373
You're doing the right thing.

1335
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,886
What the hell
are you doing here?

1336
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,154
Maria, you must be so upset.

1337
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,190
You have no idea how I feel.

1338
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,225
Please...
What is wrong with you?

1339
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,561
Wait a minute. I thought
you were nina's friend.

1340
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,897
Nina was doing this a long time
before she met Taryn.

1341
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,051
She's the one that got
my daughter into it.

1342
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:50,478
But this...
This is no time for blame.

1343
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,018
It's my fault.

1344
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,787
It's not.

1345
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,359
I shouldn't have moved her
during senior year.

1346
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:08,396
I should
have paid more attention.

1347
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,865
I did nothing
but pay attention.

1348
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,967
It didn't make a difference.

1349
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,169
I just...

1350
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,576
I can't believe
nina was doing this... thing,

1351
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,079
this awful thing, all the time.

1352
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,781
And I never knew.

1353
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,916
How could you know?

1354
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:32,787
Even when I knew something
was going on with Taryn,

1355
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:35,022
I-I-I would have
never guessed this.

1356
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:38,659
I didn't even know this existed.
Did you?

1357
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,094
No.

1358
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,900
Taryn really wanted to be here.

1359
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:49,337
You know, you're the only ones
who've come.

1360
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:53,240
I'm so sorry.

1361
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,309
I'm so sorry.

1362
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,517
Hey, nina.

1363
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,724
I'm sorry.

1364
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:47,795
I know I haven't come to see you
in like two weeks.

1365
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:52,166
I wanted to come... visit you
at the hospital,

1366
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,002
but I figured
that you didn't want to see me,

1367
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:58,839
so I just waited
till you came here.

1368
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,446
I hope that's okay.

1369
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:13,521
You look good. I like the top.

1370
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,589
It's...

1371
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,092
Nina, are you okay?

1372
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:20,327
Are you okay?

1373
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,763
Nina?

1374
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,556
Nina, you were right.

1375
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:58,032
You came to the school, and...

1376
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,935
You saw me in a different way.

1377
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,472
Everybody else just saw
the same, old Taryn.

1378
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,443
And you were right for that.

1379
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:14,415
And I just...

1380
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:19,086
I wanted things
to be different.

1381
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:24,792
I wanted to feel in control.

1382
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:35,369
But you were wrong, too.

1383
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:39,740
You were wrong
about what to do...

1384
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,343
And how to handle it.

1385
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,486
And I was wrong
for going along with it.

1386
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,168
It's not fair.

1387
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,078
It's not fair.

1388
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,396
I'll see you later.

1389
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:41,302
Nina, I'm here.

1390
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,271
I'm here.

1391
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,541
There you are.

1392
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,214
I'm here. I'm listening.

1393
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,616
I'm listening. Talk to me.

1394
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,522
Talk to me.

1395
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,793
I'm listening. Talk.

1396
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:57,978
You beat me here.

1397
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,513
Hey. Yeah.

1398
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,423
I already ordered, so...

1399
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,398
Thanks for coming.

1400
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,635
How's nina?

1401
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,672
Um...

1402
01:22:24,706 --> 01:22:26,373
Not good.

1403
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:30,477
When she choked, she hit her
head, and... it's not good

1404
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,913
at least she didn't die.

1405
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,350
Yeah, well, this is worse.

1406
01:22:47,729 --> 01:22:49,496
I'm sorry.

1407
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,599
For which part?

1408
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,302
For all of it.

1409
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,271
Mostly for the party.

1410
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,306
I screwed up.

1411
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,242
And...

1412
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:05,512
I mean, I was so stupid
for jumping you like that.

1413
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:10,684
To be fair, a lot of guys
probably wouldn't complain.

1414
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:15,356
Yeah, well, I still screwed up.

1415
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,931
Can we start over?

1416
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,303
From where? How far back?

1417
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,972
Elementary school?

1418
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:37,044
I mean, isn't that where
we were friends and it was easy?

1419
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:40,414
I don't think that
we can rewind that far.

1420
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:44,918
Here you go, hon. Enjoy.

1421
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,395
Maybe we can go back
to the part

1422
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:58,365
where you liked me
and I liked you,

1423
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,769
before everything got crazy
and screwed up.

1424
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:03,637
Is that doable?

1425
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:06,607
Yes.

1426
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,642
And maybe we can try
that thing again.

1427
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:11,145
What thing?

1428
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,821
I think I found my bliss.

1429
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,289
What?

1430
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,625
I'll tell you later.

1431
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:29,663
Hey! That was mine!

1432
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:30,964
Oh, my god!

1433
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,566
I'm sorry.

1434
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,669
Yeah, you are.
