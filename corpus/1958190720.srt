1
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,558
- That's it. I can't take this anymore.

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:22,541
- Why? No, Jamie.
It's almost over.

3
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:24,933
- I'm just tired of this kind of movies.

4
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,930
- But, I wanted you to watch this movie.

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,874
I've seen it like ten times before.

6
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:31,166
- I don't understand why you want to torture me like that?

7
00:00:31,315 --> 00:00:34,108
- They say that fear is a great aphrodisiac

8
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,716
- Of course, they do.

9
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:40,112
Beside, I found horror films reprehensible

10
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,791
The gay community is very poorly represented

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,749
Right the firsts to die or demonized

12
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:49,291
or someone is even brushing up on hysteria.

13
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:52,749
- Okay, I give you that the gays usually die first

14
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,808
but

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,190
a case can often be made that the monster himself,

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,083
which is usually the reason we watch these movies, are

17
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,493
sexually ambiguous and acting up on frustrations

18
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:05,624
So, when you're cheering for Jason Voorhees

19
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,765
you're actually cheering for the gay community.

20
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:10,041
- Whatever... Are you coming to bed or what?

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,916
There is no sexual frustration in here

22
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,247
Eric?

23
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,333
Eric?

24
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,749
You're trying to scare me?

25
00:01:36,747 --> 00:01:38,249
Eric?

26
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,124
Jesus!

27
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,549
- What?
- Nothing.

28
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,041
Are you drinking now? Is it not like a death wish?

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,906
- You're wearing that...
That is a death wish in a slashed film.

30
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:35,499
- Oh. I was counting on being
impaled by someone tonight...

31
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,541
You! Bed! Now!

32
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,458
- Eric?

33
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,708
Eric?

34
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:21,916
Are you trying to play with me?

35
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,881
That ain't to be that easy.

36
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,291
I can use this movie myself, you know?

37
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,994
I should know better  and then undo the creepy lock in the room.

38
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:53,916
- Ah!!!
- I got you!

39
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:55,666
- You are awful!

40
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,166
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

41
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,493
Just jocking.

42
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:04,083
- You know, someone told me that fear is a great aprodisiac.
- Oh yeah...?

43
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:18,803
What you get rid of the stuff under the bed last week?

44
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:20,999
- I did. Why?
