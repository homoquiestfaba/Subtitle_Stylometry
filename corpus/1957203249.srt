00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,481
LILY: Who's Adam talking to?

6
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,083
SEAN: I don't know.
He's being all Hollywood
right now.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,217
LILY: He's so Hollywood.

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,252
Look, that's Hollywood.

9
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,620
LILY: Hollywood?
He's probably on...

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,189
He's probably on the phone
with his agent.

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,457
LILY: That's it.
That's what it looks like?
"I didn't sign up for this."

12
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,659
DURRIE: It's a type of candy.
It's like, um...

13
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:30,331
It has the consistency
of a Jolly Rancher
but the flavor of, like...

14
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,600
Kind of liquorish almost.
SEAN: And you eat these things?

15
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,702
Yeah, my grandmother
would have them.

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,470
They're little like lozenges.

17
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,272
LARISSA: I bet
she had horehounds.

18
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:41,475
Yeah, my grandmother had
a bucket of horehounds.

19
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,177
You happy now?
Yes.

20
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,413
Yes, I am.

21
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:48,182
LILY: Let's just, uh,
repeat the scene.
[CLEARS THROAT]

22
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,321
Look at this place.

23
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:56,224
Looks like a gold plated
trash can.

24
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,459
They do?
Do you think
we deserve this?

25
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,864
Hey, what's up, everybody?
This is Lily,

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,500
your director,
talking to you
from the van.

27
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,170
We are on the way
to Vegas,

28
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:12,273
shooting my feature film,
Napoleon.

29
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,808
I've got my lovely cast
in the van with me.

30
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:17,545
Let's meet everybody.

31
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,448
These are my actors.

32
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,284
This is Durrie.

33
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,819
Durrie is an actor.
Living the dream.

34
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,788
LILY: Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

35
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,525
LILY: This is
bonus feature material.

36
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,496
Durrie is multitasking.
He's driving.

37
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,465
Yes, yes, I'm multitalented.

38
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,100
LILY: Larissa.
Hi.

39
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,869
LILY: Hey, lady.
Hi.

40
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,272
There's Joy.

41
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:45,806
She's sleeping as you can see.

42
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,211
We've been driving for a while.

43
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,580
Alycen.

00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,881
Hey.
LILY: Hey.

45
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,450
Casey, what's up?

46
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:58,352
Hey.
Hey.

47
00:01:58,386 --> 00:01:59,520
There's Sean.

48
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,189
Hey, buddy.

49
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,257
And Adam.

50
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,526
The lovely Adam.

51
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,895
What's up?
You guys jazzed?

52
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,730
We're going to Vegas, baby.
Vegas!

53
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,831
Yeah.
Vegas.

54
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:11,932
LILY: Whoo!

55
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,267
Coffee then Vegas.

56
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,368
Hey, Lily, um...

57
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,738
What if we went
to that little Vegas,
the fake one?

58
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,473
The Baby... Baby Vegas?

59
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,941
LILY: Broomtown?
With the roller coaster.

60
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,676
I hate you, Vegas.
LILY: You wanna stop
at Broomtown?

61
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,278
Yeah!
LILY: Why?

62
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,746
Why not?

63
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,915
LILY: 'Cause we're going
to real Vegas. Why would
we go to fake Vegas?

64
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,650
So we can get ready.
SEAN: Real Vegas.

65
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,252
DURRIE: So we can all
smell like failure.

66
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:32,653
For, like, an hour.
[LILLY LAUGHS]

67
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,189
LILY: Nah.
LARISSA: Yeah,
it's on the way, though.

68
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,525
LILY: If you want to stop,
we should, um...

69
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,761
There's this cool spot
on the way.

70
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,231
This mining town, Garlock.

71
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:44,798
We stop there
and check it out.
Yes.

72
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,235
Yes, let's do that.

73
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,402
[LAUGHING] What?

74
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,404
Let's do that,
let's do that.

75
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:52,840
Garlock, let's go there.
LARISSA:
That's the real name?

76
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,208
Is that the real name?
Who knows?

77
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,610
She's not... She's serious.

78
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,980
There's this place.
I was reading
before we came out.

79
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,784
There's a couple of them
out here. And it was one,
and it's called Garlock.

80
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,587
And it is by far
the coolest looking one.
By far.

81
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,855
And it is like some weird...

82
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,757
LARISSA: Are there
like hotels and stuff?
Is there a pool?

83
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,226
[CHUCKLES] No, no.

84
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,362
ADAM: It's like a creepy, old,
weird mining town.

85
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,964
And there was this guy,
like, I don't know, like,
a billion years ago.

86
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,832
LILY: I can't believe
you know this.
I know, right?

87
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,868
And he's like...
This guy's name is...

88
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,637
Burro Schmidt.
Burro, totally.

89
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,907
El Burro. And he,
he wanted to get, like,

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,244
ore from, like, one side
to the other side
of the mountains,

91
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,580
which blew a freaking hole
through it or something
like that.

92
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,884
And then he took...

93
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,520
I don't know, like,
his life or something
in the cave

94
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,855
and then next thing you know
he's haunting the place,

95
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,958
and now the town is weird,
decrepit and old and freaky.

96
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,460
We should totally go there.
Sounds great.

97
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,995
Instead of...
LARISSA: A touristy
type of place?

98
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,364
I wouldn't say touristy.

99
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,401
I would say...
I would say
sketchy as hell.

100
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,604
I would say fun,
I would say cool,
I would say weird.

101
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,839
CASEY: You guys, we should
just get to Vegas, I think.

102
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,409
We have a movie to shoot,
remember?

103
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,644
We have to prep,
rehearse, settle in...

104
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,313
ADAM: Casey,
you're really boring.

105
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,649
Wow.
LILY: Yeah, but like...

106
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,685
LILY: We don't even
have to shoot
till tomorrow afternoon.

107
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,789
I know, but still,
we should get there,
settle in, prepare, right?

108
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,792
So, this is like
by Vegas, or in Vegas?

109
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,061
LILY: We could just
check it out
like real fast.

110
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,764
Oh, so we should
definitely go.
It sounds like fun.

111
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:24,898
LILY: Yeah, it's on the way.

112
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,536
ADAM: A room in the mountain
that has chandeliers in it.

113
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,505
What? Oh, my God.
Super weird, right?

114
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,974
DURRIE: It's like a weird,
creepy little...
Is it really haunted?

115
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,744
If they want to stop
at little Vegas, then
we stop where they stop.

116
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,548
LILY: Don't fight.

117
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,350
It's not far. It's not
far off the road.

118
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,385
It's worth going and seeing.
It's still day time.

119
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,619
LILY: Yeah, it's on the way.

120
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,489
It'll be fun,
it'll be creepy,
it'll be great.

121
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,091
LILY: Yeah, Durrie,
should we stop?
We're stopping.

122
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,061
We can go anywhere
where I can stop driving.

00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,665
Okay, it's decided
we're going.

125
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,468
We're gonna go
see Garlock, we're gonna
see what it's all about.

126
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,069
Get some excellent b-roll.

127
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,038
LILY: Onward, my friend.

128
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,874
We are Garlock bound.

129
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,842
Awesome!

130
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,844
I have no idea
where that's at.

What?

00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,283
What?

134
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,588
What... What do we deserve?
What...

135
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,789
Are you high?

137
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,560
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,129
ADAM: He was fat,
and he was a dork.

139
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,366
DURRIE: And works for the NSA.
LILY: You're such a virgin.

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,668
LARISSA: Haunted things,
and I don't like that.

141

[ALL LAUGHING]
ADAM: That's the problem.
I mean, that DUI...

142
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,572
LILY: He's passive-aggressive.

143
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,574
DURRIE: Keep your secrets.
Don't tell 'em to me.

144
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,379
I don't like fish.
I don't like...

145
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,448
Is it Jaws or is it
like just fish?

146
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,817
No, it's like fish.
Like, a shark
would freak me out.

147
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,453
But I think a shark
would scare everybody.
Like, I'm not...

148
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,689
If anybody was swimming
and a shark swam by them,
everybody would be like,

149
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,958
"Fuck, move!" Uh...

150
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,828
But, like, if a...

151
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,295
You're not scared
of getting mugged?

152
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,932
A salmon swam by me
and I was swimming,
I'd be like, "Ugh! Fuck."

153
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,834
You're not scared
of getting mugged?

154
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,003
Sure. But again,
I think that's something
that scares everybody.

155
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,905
That scares everybody,
is scared of getting mugged.

156
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,874
Uh, and everyone's
getting mugged.

I have some good news.
I think we're almost there.

it looks all the same.

I can feel the spookiness.

You remember that bush,
right?

It was in this pamphlet.

LILY: How do you know
this is it?

169
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,701
This is nothing.
DURRIE: 'Cause it's
the only other road.

170
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,770
ADAM: This is totally it.

171
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,539
LILY: Dude, don't drive
all the way up there
with the van.

172
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,740
It'll fuck up the van.

173
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,111
LILY: Here we are,
majestic Garlock.

174

175
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,819
Come on.

00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,921
LILY: Casey?
I'll just wait for you guys.

177
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,957
Come on, Casey.
I don't know,
I'll just hang back here.

SEAN: We could be
here for hours.

179

You'll love it.
You will like it.

Everyone is looking now.

182
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,502

Your trailer's up here.

185
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,540
Perfect.

LILY: Yeah!

187
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,912
SEAN: You want that, Casey?

188
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,014
LILY: There's hillbillies?
SEAN: You should
take it if you want it.

189
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,716
LARISSA: Not even close enough
to tell if they're mutated.

190
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,584
LILY: Guys.
You guys are so sexy.

191
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,853

I found your bed, Sean.

LILY: You see
the swimming pool?

194
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,510
Is this in my contract?

195
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:59,880
You think it's covered
if I fall down and break
my ankle? [LAUGHS]

196
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,549
LILY: Don't break your ankle.

197
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,983
I have
a first aid kit, though.

198
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,552
These aren't hiking shoes.

199
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,620
I thought we were
gonna be in a hotel.

200
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,522
LILY: Yeah, I know,
Vegas, right?

201
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,658

there's a house over here?

anybody lives out here?

204
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,962
LILY: I don't know.
There's a house over here.

205
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,830
The rape house.
What do you mean "House"?

206
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,566
There's a house.

ADAM: Great choice.

208
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,535

place for anything.
Very good.

ALYCEN: Oh,
this is disgusting.

214
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,562
So what's the deal
with this place, you guys?

215
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,530
Cases of shellings
on the floor.

216
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,601
Empty cans of beer.

217
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,641
LILY: Holy shit.

218
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,610
It's shells, dude.

ADAM: Shady business.

226
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,156
Someone lost a foot.

227
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,626
What're you saying?
Why would you ever
leave without your boot?

228
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,027
You come here with two boots.

229
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,361
This is fuckin'
redneck country.

230
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,263
Why leave without one?

231

there's the other one.
There's the other one.

a good place.

CASEY: This place is great.
What are you talking about?

234
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:36,043
This is better than
our hotel room in Vegas.

235
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,880
LILY: I think we're deep
in the heart of redneck country
is what I think.

236
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,249
Your masseuse
is in the other house.

Be careful going down.

always dies first.

246
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,040
It looks kinda cool
from the outside.

00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,177
Who knows what's
on the inside?

248
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,946
I told you.
I told you the Asian
would go first.

Yeah.

How do you know what
skinhead writing looks like?
'Cause it says "Skins".

Where are all these mines
you were talking about?

I have actually
never been here, Casey.
Right.

But you looked it up?
Yeah, I looked it up
on the Internet.

of a summer vacationing place.

whether it is acting,

to be in writing or if
it doesn't end up being that,

00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,433
Not even now?
No.

333
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,468
There's crackers.
CASEY: Great.

334
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,038
Thanks, Joy.

335
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,941
LILY: Obviously, it's not
the battery because the lights
are on in the car.

336
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,642
Well, I know
it's not the battery.

337
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,979
No, it might have enough
juice to power the lights but
not to turn the engine over.

338
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,047
Still, good point.

339
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,515
JOY: There' enough for
the radio and lights.

340
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,516
CASEY: Why hasn't
anyone phoned yet?

341
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,585
LILY: Dude, because I have
no fucking signal.

342
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,255
Like, my piece of shit
phone has no signal.

343
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,456
Do you?

344
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,992
LILY: Here,
I have the number.
I'll give it to you.

345
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,493
Try it on your cell.
Nobody gets service.

346
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,229
'Cause we're out in
the middle of nowhere.

347
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,931
This'll look great.

348
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,598
ALYCEN: Well,
who's idea was this?

349
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,200
How far away are we
from the last...

350
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,102
No one has service.
LILY: Sixty miles.

351
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,103
Sixty miles?

352
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,105
LILY: Yeah, that's
the fucking last town.

353
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,375
ALYCEN: How many?
LILY: Sixty miles. 6-0.

354
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,046
LILY: All we need to do
is just chill out.

355
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,083
Why don't we just like
fucking grab the bottle of
vodka and grab our shit,

356
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,317
and kick it...
Are you joking?

357
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,618
Like, we're gonna
have a crack house.

358
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,587
LILY: Well, we can't
fucking stay down here.

359
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,091
Like, all of us.
We can't even fit with
all the equipment in there.

360
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,060
Like...
We're gonna stay
in the crack house.

361
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,227
Yeah, no.

362
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,562
LILY: We all
have to stay together.

363
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,531
Why not?
Did you go down there?

364
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,600
Yeah, but I mean...

365
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,435
LILY: Dude, we all
have to stay together.

366
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,138
And shells all over the floor.
Yeah, that sounds great.

367
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,942
What the fuck else
are we gonna do?

368
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,944
We need to figure out
where we're staying tonight.

369
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:15,015
Phones don't work.
We're not fucking
walking anywhere.

370
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:18,285
So, that's what we're doing.
We're fucking sticking around
for a little bit.

371
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,419
Let this thing cool down.

372
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,587
LILY: Yeah, exactly.

373
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,990
ADAM: Yeah, we can
definitely go back
to the house.

374
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,092
SEAN: Crack house.
If it gets too cold
out here.

375
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,160
LILY: Or we could light...
Does anybody have
a lighter?

376
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,062
I need...
I need my jacket.

377
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,998
Put your coat on.
It's getting cold.

378
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,133
LILY: Do we have flash lights?

379
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,535
Dude, we have flash lights
in the car in the...

380
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,338
We got flash lights,
we're good.
LILY: We have flash lights.

381
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,974
Just grab some warm shit,
grab your warm shit.

382
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,542
Really? We're doing this?

383
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,112
Casey, what are the options?
We can't walk 60 miles.

384
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,380
It's a little crazy.
And then, we should
not have stopped.

385
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,548
We should have just
went to Vegas.

386
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,351
LILY: I know.
I'm sorry that we did,
but we did.

387
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,720
I mean,
we can't just...

388
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,389
Well, we're fucking
stuck here for the night.

389
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,027
Our van's still not working,

390
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,331
and looks like we're gonna
hole up in this here
shanty shack.

391
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,166
Crack shack.
It's really fucking cold.

393
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,004
God, Adam!

394
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:14,674
You scared the fucking
shit out of me, dude.

395
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,744
[GRUNTS] Let's go
check out our new home.

396
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,983
LILY: Careful.

397
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,354
[DOOR CREAKS]

398
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,708
I do not want
to go in there.

399
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,678
LILY: Yeah, but there's
no one in there.
They're moving furniture.

400
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,081
ADAM: Ladies, come on in.

401
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,248
JOY: No, that's
not what she's saying.

402
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,217
She's saying that
when we left here
the door was open.

403
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,186
And when we got here again
it was closed.

404
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,354
LILY: It's cold and...

405
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:05,192
The wind might have...
...and we gotta stay warm.

406
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,261
It stinks in here.
Yeah, it smells really bad.

407
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,829
SEAN: Just the girls.
We're not sleeping in here.

408
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,065
We're not sleeping at all.
Are you kidding me?

409
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,634
Well, okay, fine.

410
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,171
LILY: You guys okay?

411
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,372
No, I'm not okay!

412
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,074
LILY: I know, but...

413
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,510
We should be in a hotel room
right now, this is...

414
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,677
LILY: I know.

415
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,778
All right, all right.

416
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,115
This is the kind of place
that fucked up people...

417
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,550
That isn't happening.
Anyone could
come here right now.

418
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,851
There's nothing we can
do about that.

419
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,586
Everybody,
just calm down!

420
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,787
Everybody...

421
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,225
LILY: Yeah, I agree.
Just have a seat.

422
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,459
Take a deep breath.

423
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,228
The car got overheated,

424
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:43,363
so I'm gonna go check on that.

425
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,099
Everybody else stay here, okay?
Don't go by yourself.

426
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,201
I'm the only one that
knows what they're doing.

427
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,836
But don't go by yourself.
Go with somebody.

00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,440
Adam, cut the light.
Lily, you come.

429
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,175
Will somebody...
One of the boys stay.

430
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,643
Sean will stay.
I got it.

431
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,111
Give me the lantern.

00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,413
ADAM: Lily, you come with me.
LILY: All right.

433
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,382

you can hit someone with.

we'll be right back.

LILY: Fucking pretty sweet
idea to come to Garlock.

441
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:24,504
I'm so sorry
about that. [LAUGHS]

442
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,239

in Vegas right now.

be so insane.

please tell me it's...

446
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,818
Please.
We're out of here.

447
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,225
LILY: So that thing
is the same?

448
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,560
No, I...
I don't know what it is.

449
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,529
I mean, the lights work
and the battery's fine.

450
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:53,566
I checked the fluid.
I checked the oil,
I checked the timing belt.

451
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,171
I don't know
what's wrong with it.

452
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,174
LILY: All right, so,

453
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,443
okay, so hang on a second.
Come here.

454
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,279
Okay, so we're
staying here.

00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,183
Yeah.
'Cause the girls
are freaking out.

00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,785
I'm gonna go back there
and have to tell them that.

So, we just have to fucking...
What are we gonna do?

00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,795
We're gonna stay the night,
we have no choice.

00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,266
And then,
tomorrow morning...

462
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,868

We'll figure it out.
Be in Vegas by fucking noon.

00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,537

465
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:36,509
Let's just grab the vodka.

466
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,278
Yeah?
Let's fucking grab it.

467
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,780
Let's get fucked up.

468
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,882
There was this episode
of Rescue 911 once

469
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,252
where they performed
a tracheotomy on this guy
on an airplane,

470
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,919
and it was totally
like a re-enactment.

471
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,789
But like, the took
a ball point pen and they
stuck it in his throat

472
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,259
because he was choking,
and there was blood everywhere.

473
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53,593
I was like... [SHUDDERS]

474
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,595
Like, I literally couldn't
pick anything up
with my hands.

475
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,797
I couldn't pick up
the remote control
to change the channel

476
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,600
because I was literally
like, "Oh, my God."

477
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,336
So, yeah, maybe I think
I'm a hard ass,
and that's in my head.

478
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,905
[LAUGHS]
I'm probably a big wimp.

479
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,674
It's cold.

480
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,343
Turn the camera off.

481
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,446
LILY: No. I mean,
I'm in a room...

482
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,882
I'm in a room full of actors
with a camera.

483
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:22,255
Oh, yeah, I could
turn it off and then
we'd have no light.

484
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,257
Don't turn that off.
Just leave it on.

485
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,792
You don't have to put it
in my face, oh, God.

486
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,927
Maybe not burn my retinas.
[LILY CHUCKLES]

487
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,764
I, uh, am going to
get in that pool

488
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,000
that goes by itself
and you just lay in the thing.

489
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,702

I don't care.

with an umbrella,
cheery, and a pineapple.

that sounds good.

I'm just gonna
stay in my bed.
[EXHALES] I'm there.

494
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,514
I'm not gonna leave the room.
I'm there.

00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,748
