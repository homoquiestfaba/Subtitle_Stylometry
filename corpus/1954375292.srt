and fell for him.

go down last week

That, even at the
peak of its powers,

916
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:21,123
it just wasn't worth it for
the Romans to go in there.

917
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:27,464
So this emperor, Hadrian,
built a wall across Scotland.

919

920

do whatever the fuck he wanted.

923

924
