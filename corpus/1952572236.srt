1
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:33,026
It's the third time today.

2
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,018
Where's the epicenter?

3
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:37,841
<i>A hundred and twenty miles 
northwest of the fault.</i>
 
</i>

4
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:41,026
<i>The seismograph must be malfunctioning.</i>

5
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:44,832
No, it was serviced last week.

6
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,702
Just keep an eye for me, Charlie.

7
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,868
Uh, and call me if it gets worse.

8
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,571
Where're you going?

9
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,943
I've got someone
I gotta take care of.

10
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,589
Sorry I'm late.

11
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:40,024
Shouldn't you plug
that thing in
or something?

12
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:42,188
Hybrids are the way
for the future, Jake.

13
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,323
<i>Well, If we believed
everything that you read</i>

14
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,889
<i>we would all be
living on the moon</i>

15
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,027
and driving flying
suitcases by now,
wouldn't we?

16
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,935
It's all marketing,
little brother.

17
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:53,440
You and dad have been
telling me that
one since birth.

18
00:04:53,508 --> 00:04:56,068
Since I am the only
one still on this
side of reality,

19
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:59,170
I figure I owe it
to the old man to
keep you grounded.

20
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:34,644
Look, bro, it seems like the
old family barbecue thing is
a little stressful on you,

21
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,914
so if you wanna just take
a rain check this month
it's not a problem.

22
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:41,251
I promised mom and
dad we'd do this. I'm
not gonna let them down.

23
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:45,020
That is a lovely sentiment.
However, I don't really think
that they can see us,

24
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,617
so, you know, you can chill.

25
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,759
You do Chinese takeout.

26
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,495
I got some pizza
pockets in the
fridge right there.

27
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,595
Chill. Yeah, that's
always been easy
for you.

28
00:05:56,672 --> 00:06:01,132
<i>Since you stood up to
Tate, you've become
a freaking legend.</i>

29
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:05,042
Even in failure.
You're a success.

30
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:08,481
Well, you're the one
with the big house
and the weird car.

31
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:10,451
All I've got is my
fat boy out there,

32
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,387
a couple of sober
memories with Monica,
and my six pack.

33
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,655
My three pack right now.
About to be a two pack
right now.

34
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,990
She resigned last month.

35
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,726
<i>Said It was med leave.
But I don't think...</i>

36
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,101
<i>Mm-mh,
buh, buh...</i>

37
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:33,505
Let's not bring up the past.

38
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:39,011
<i>I wanna do something
on my own, you know.</i>

39
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,411
Something memorable.

40
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,420
You'll get there.

41
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,352
I'm all show.

42
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:50,586
I wish mom and dad
could see ya. Little
G Q scientist.

43
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,787
They'd be really proud of you.

44
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,090
You really think so?

45
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,222
I know so.

46
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,828
Let me borrow 20 bucks.

47
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:01,962
What?

48
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,028
What about 40 bucks?

49
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,095
Jackass.

50
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,265
What the hell?

51
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:09,768
My God, they're
headed right for us.

52
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,570
Call it.
It's a real deal.

53
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,510
Black ten, black ten.
We've a security breach
at S-4. This is not a drill.

54
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,514
<i>Priority one.
Priority one.</i>

55
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,288
<i>Move. Move.</i>

56
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,419
<i>Move, move.</i>

57
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:34,191
Take it up.

58
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,910
Okay. I'm
getting old.

59
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,915
Eight, eight, eight
from the ranch.

60
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,887
Oh. Pizza
pockets for me.

61
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,355
Gotta go.
Lock up for
me, will ya?

62
00:09:01,424 --> 00:09:02,756
Right.

63
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:06,362
Probably a bucket of nothing.

64
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,329
<i>Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?</i>

65
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,342
Hostile. Sir,
target is hostile.

66
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,381
Target is hostile!

67
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:28,763
Where the hell is Alex?

68
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,800
Let's go.
Let's go.
C'mon.

69
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:06,197
<i>Go, go go, go.
Go, go, go.</i>

70
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,636
Ready, Captain.
Ready, Captain. Ready.

71
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,543
Ready, Captain.
Ready, Captain.

72
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,206
You will be fired upon.

73
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,310
<i>Hold your positions.</i>

74
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:25,051
<i>This Is your
final warning.</i>

75
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,056
Fire!

76
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,747
Medic!

77
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:12,601
This is Alpha One.
We have sustained
major casualties.

78
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,867
<i>I need immediate
backup for my location.</i>

79
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,242
<i>Let's go,
let's go.</i>

80
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:26,817
Charlie!

81
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,117
We have two
unidentifieds
crash-land near by.

82
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:31,487
One target is hostile.
They took out the chopper.

83
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,082
Hangar S-4
is under attack.

84
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,821
Medivac units are already...

85
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:38,626
All right, calm down.
Call Tate. Get
Down here now.

86
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,394
Do it!

87
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,958
Saddle up!
Let's go!

88
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,077
Where is my Medivac?  My men
 are dying.  I need backup.


89
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,518
<i>Where Is my Medlvac?
I need help now I</i>

90
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:06,005
What happened here?

91
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,934
<i>Hands In the air! Put your
hands In the air now I.</i>

92
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:19,853
Pull back.  Everyone
out, now!


93
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:29,792
Argh!

94
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:48,610
Ah!

95
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:52,279
<i>Welcome everyone
to Eye Witness News.</i>

96
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:54,949
<i>The news source
In the region.</i>

97
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:57,549
<i>The source for all

98
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,755
<i>There are reports of a
 disturbance in the

99
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,958
<i>We take you live now to our
 correspondent standing by.
</i>

100
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:07,002
<i>Sources from the Department
of Natural Resources</i>

101
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,736
<i>say the explosion within the
 military wildlife refuge Is
 nothing to worry about.</i>

102
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:16,404
Plumes of black smoke can be
 seen as far as Jefferson
 County.

103
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,676
So far, park rangers are not
 saying what caused the explosion,


104
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:22,411
but they are admitting there 
may be a few fatalities.


105
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,476
Alex.
God!

106
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,291
<i>What do you mean
he's not available?</i>

107
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:34,125
This is Jake Townsend,
his brother.

108
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,824
Then let me talk
to Charlie Weise.

109
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:38,129
No, you can't take a message?

110
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,761
What the hell is going on there?

111
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:42,395
Hello?

112
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,871
Fine.

113
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,636
Have it your way, then.

114
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,475
<i>The public has
the right to Information.</i>

115
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:23,809
There are children around
here. You've gotta give
us something.

116
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,660
<i>Hands where I can see 'em I.</i>

117
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:23,794
Jake.

118
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,426
Hey, Charlie.
You got my message.

119
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:26,834
You shouldn't be here.

120
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,202
Where's Alex?

121
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,638
I can't answer that.

122
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,302
I don't really care about
the operation anymore.

123
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,538
I just wanna know where
my brother is, okay?

124
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,581
I got a bad feeling about this.

125
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:40,482
You know I can't disclose
classified information
to a civilian.

126
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,351
Then let's pretend
I'm still in the inside.

127
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,322
I can't do it.

128
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,451
I'm not going anywhere
until somebody gives
me some answers.

129
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,188
Don't put me in the position.

130
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,894
Cuff him. Put him
in the jeep.

131
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:46,081
You can't hold me down
here without processing
me with an attorney present.

132
00:23:46,152 --> 00:23:49,315
Shut up, Townsend.
You've no rights
here. Not any more.

133
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:55,951
I got it.

134
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:04,734
 Nice acting job, Brando.

135
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,364
Two unidentifieds
crashed in the park
this morning.

136
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,900
<i>One confirmed hostile
target. Then all hell
broke loose at hangar S-4.</i>

137
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,103
S-4.

138
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:14,203
Yeah.

139
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,545
Sorry, uh, about the cuffs.

140
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:23,546
Alex took a team
to S-4, and hasn't
reported back in, yet.

141
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:26,285
It's big, Jake.
The pros are here.

142
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:28,988
Tate.

143
00:24:29,062 --> 00:24:31,292
It'll all be covered up by dawn.

144
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,558
Right, right, right.

145
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,327
I gotta go.

146
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:43,973
For your brother.

147
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,718
Target one appears to
be heading west towards
the town of Mercury.

148
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,815
<i>Satellite's lost
the second target.</i>

149
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:35,454
<i>Assemble unlit to Intercept
target one. We'll pick 'em
off one at a time.</i>

150
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,292
<i>I want them both In
a box by sundown.</i>

151
00:25:37,364 --> 00:25:38,831
Yes, Sir.

152
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:42,164
All right, men,
let's move it up.
Mercury. Chop chop.

153
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:57,807
Hello, M r. Townsend.

154
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:01,481
Where is my brother?

155
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:03,250
How does that uniform feel?

156
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:05,655
Familiar yet out of reach?

157
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:09,161
You're not only trespassing,
but impersonating a
federal officer.

158
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:10,754
All I wanna now is where is Alex.

159
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,356
The official story?

160
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,993
He's on extended vacation.
Fly fishing I think.

161
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:18,163
Come on, Tate.
Enough for the area
51 cover-up crap.

162
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,536
I think you've
overhead too much
as it is.

163
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:22,768
Take this man in hold
and have him sedated.

164
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:24,902
The suits will want
to debrief him.

165
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,845
This isn't the end of it.

166
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,078
Sure it is, Jake.

167
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:15,923
Get a jeep!

168
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,577
Pull it over, buddy.

169
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:02,241
Oh, yeah!

170
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,280
Oh-ho, ho-ho.
Thank you,
Play Station.

171
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:19,019
<i>Jake Townsend
has escaped.</i>

172
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,857
He's about to cross
the perimeter.

173
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:24,729
Go find his ass, you
pack of geniuses!
Let's roll!

174
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:05,697
Oh-oh.

175
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,092
Get out of the vehicle.

176
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,542
Put the weapon down.

177
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:47,480
What do you want?

178
00:30:28,224 --> 00:30:29,748
I need your help.

179
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,360
You speak English.

180
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,489
I speak many languages.
It is part of my training.

181
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,500
<i>You've got a pretty
bad Injury...</i>

182
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:41,935
<i>It Is not important.
I need your help with
something greater than I.</i>

183
00:30:46,008 --> 00:30:48,272
Why me?

184
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:52,111
It seems that you are also
in jeopardy. Perhaps we
could help each other.

185
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,342
Like what?

186
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,510
<i>I must find
the Omega seed.</i>

187
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,678
<i>A large obelisk.</i>

188
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:59,550
What do you need that for?

189
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:03,058
At sundown tomorrow
it will destroy the
inhabitants of this planet

190
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:06,688
unless it is
deactivated with this.

191
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:11,928
The Ether rod.

192
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:15,802
Where you at S-4?
Did you kill
those guys?

193
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,840
No. There
is another.

194
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:19,841
Another, another
what? Another...

195
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:24,813
My navigation system was
destroyed by an Omega
centurion named Kronnan

196
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,318
<i>whose sole mission Is
to see that the Omega
seed detonates.</i>

197
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:39,388
<i>Will you help me?</i>

198
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:42,728
I think I know somebody
that can help us.

199
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:48,227
Get in.

200
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:42,382
Oh, Yeah. I heard rumors
of the Omega seed, but it
was classified even for me.

201
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,452
Look, she might be
able to help us out but
it could take some time.

202
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,294
Tell her something.
We have little hope.

203
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,862
C'mon.

204
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,488
I don't believe it.

205
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,285
Monica.

206
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,891
My mother said
you'd come crawling
back eventually.

207
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,899
But you should've
brought flowers.

208
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,764
I brought him.

209
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,041
Oh, my God.

210
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,084
We need your help.

211
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,722
Come in.

212
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,673
You're hurt.

213
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:37,836
It is nothing.

214
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,871
Let us help you.

215
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,712
Come on.

216
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:53,851
Men.

217
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,964
I require N H4O H.

218
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,943
Jake, hand me the ammonia.

219
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,409
In the cabinet.

220
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,074
<i>Top shelf.</i>

221
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,547
The Omega seed is
like a thermometer.

222
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,424
It monitors the
development of a
planet until it is ripe.

223
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:29,928
Ripe for what?

224
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,089
Harvesting.

225
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:36,760
The Omega race relies on
artificial waste products
from civilized planets.

226
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:40,498
Fossil fuels emissions,
nuclear waste and alike.

227
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,563
Why they don't just ask for them?

228
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,268
We'd be happy to get rid of it.

229
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:48,110
They do not negotiate.
They conquer.

230
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:54,880
That is enough.

231
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,215
So, what?

232
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:05,128
The obelisk sends out
a signal when the planet's
ready and then they invade?

233
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:08,531
The obelisk will
send off a signal but
it will also detonate,

234
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:11,092
releasing a pathogen
into the atmosphere.

235
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,502
Pathogen.

236
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:17,133
Anything that breaths
will be dead in 36 hours.

237
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,172
How do we stop it?

238
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,476
The Ether rod.

239
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:26,485
<i>The Omega race designed them.
It's a safety switch to prevent
a premature detonation.</i>

240
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:29,454
<i>We managed to obtain
several of them.</i>

241
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,958
However, this one
fell into the hands
of your race

242
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,687
sixty years ago.

243
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,021
Crashes of '47.

244
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:47,472
<i>As your planet was
recently targeted
by the Omega race,</i>

245
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,599
I was sent to retrieve
the Ether rod

246
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:52,338
and deactivate the Omega seed.

247
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:56,110
<i>But It was not until
recently when the seed
began to activate</i>

248
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:59,481
that I was able
to determine the
rod's true location.

249
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:02,419
What about all
the interest
in area 51?

250
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,788
Well, the government
obviously leaked stories
towards Mexico

251
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,828
to keep the enthusiasts
away from the real deal
here in Missouri.

252
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,886
Why don't you just
use another Ether rod?

253
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:14,662
Because each Omega seed
has a specific Ether rod.

254
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,636
A key to a deadly lock.

255
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:21,196
This is the only one
that can stop it.

256
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:24,107
But without my navigation
system, I am blind.

257
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,820
I've heard about
a "Mythigalian" structure

258
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,379
discovered underground
in the '30s.

259
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:39,358
<i>The story goes the
government covered up
classifying lt,</i>

260
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,053
but I've no idea where it is.

261
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:45,029
The location of the seed
is coded onto the
Ether rod itself.

262
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:48,926
So, you can speak English,

263
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,800
and you can fly a spaceship

264
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:54,102
but you can't
translate the Ether rod.

265
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:56,404
My hard drive has been disabled.

266
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:59,503
You might wanna think
about night school.

267
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,913
<i>Look, I brought him here
because I thought you might
help us decode the glyphs.</i>

268
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:09,482
So, so now I'm
your go-to girl?

269
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:13,084
You wouldn't let me
study it before it was
put in a classified storage.

270
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,028
Then you vanished and
I was stuck in a file
room for two years.

271
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:19,258
No calls, no emails.

272
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,529
I was discharged.

273
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:24,736
What?

274
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:31,071
I signed a release
for you to have the
Ether rod for study.

275
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:34,376
And Tate got a hold
of it and freaked.

276
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:38,407
If I had talked to you
about it, we'd both
been court marshaled.

277
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,785
It was part of the agreement
that you and I would
never speak again.

278
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:44,923
You protected me.

279
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:51,924
Jake, I'm...
I'm sorry.

280
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,091
There's nothing to be sorry for.

281
00:38:57,172 --> 00:39:00,767
You have access
to the Ether rod now.

282
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:03,208
Can you decipher it?

283
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:07,041
Maybe. It's gonna
take some time.

284
00:39:07,115 --> 00:39:09,605
You must hurry.

285
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,800
Alex is missing.

286
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:34,630
What?

287
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:36,136
Zero contact.

288
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:40,570
I'm sure he's just gone deep.

289
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:45,279
You used to vanish too, remember?

290
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:49,682
I don't know this time.

291
00:40:52,354 --> 00:40:53,946
He'll turn up.

292
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:01,058
<i>Time Is running short.</i>

293
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,563
I've almost got it.

294
00:41:02,631 --> 00:41:04,258
We've got another 18 hours.

295
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,825
Kronnan must have
the location locked
by now. He is coming.

296
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:10,235
U h, not helping.

297
00:41:15,677 --> 00:41:17,543
<i>Just let her
work, okay?</i>

298
00:41:21,383 --> 00:41:24,614
So, uh, you got a name or...

299
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:27,078
Jude.

300
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:29,351
I'm Jake.

301
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,834
So, where are you from?

302
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,603
Far away.

303
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:51,976
You have family there?

304
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:53,948
I had a mate.

305
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:56,815
Had?

306
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,184
Killed by Kronnan.

307
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:06,717
<i>Jude! Jude!
Jude! Jude!</i>

308
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:43,326
What was her name?

309
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:47,035
Quintana.

310
00:42:47,103 --> 00:42:50,163
I'm sorry.

311
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,901
I lost my parents.

312
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:55,875
I am sorry.

313
00:42:56,947 --> 00:42:59,245
I found it.
It's in Potosi.

314
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:06,319
Go, go, go.
Let's go.

315
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,857
<i>Hands where I
can see 'em.</i>

316
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,296
No. Nobody
gets hurt.

317
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:24,131
Your weapon, sir.
Your weapon.

318
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:48,162
<i>Jake, you're becoming
quite a thorn. Don't you
know this thing Is dangerous?</i>

319
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:49,630
He's here to help, Tate.

320
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,757
Oh, please.

321
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:52,062
Humvee's ready, Sir.

322
00:43:52,135 --> 00:43:53,763
Roger that. We'll
debrief there.

323
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,068
But I want our visitor
here shackled now.

324
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,404
Remember these bad boys?

325
00:43:58,476 --> 00:44:00,774
Unbreakable, my friend.

326
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:11,646
What about the others?

327
00:44:11,722 --> 00:44:12,746
I'll take that.

328
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:14,154
Monica.

329
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:16,022
I told you she
couldn't be controlled.

330
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:18,584
Screw you, Tate.
I know the truth.

331
00:44:18,663 --> 00:44:20,756
She's got a bigger
mouth than yours, Jake.

332
00:44:20,831 --> 00:44:23,322
I know you're here to
contain alien activity.

333
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,926
How many of these visitors
have you exterminated?

334
00:44:26,003 --> 00:44:29,530
Does he seem like
a girl scout to you?

335
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:31,575
We're cleaners, Monica.

336
00:44:31,642 --> 00:44:35,339
Mr. and Mrs. Muster sitting
down on the prairie can't
handle the truth.

337
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:38,473
They should thank me
every day for keeping
them safe in their towns

338
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:41,450
of mediocre life.

339
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,454
So just shut
your damn mouth,
all right?

340
00:44:44,522 --> 00:44:46,354
All right, let's move it out.

341
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,596
<i>Tate, I know how
much you like to
cover things up,</i>

342
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:59,762
but you have no idea how
public this is gonna be.
We're talking global disaster.

343
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,032
Well, good luck with
that, M r. Conspiracy.

344
00:45:02,106 --> 00:45:03,972
Does he look like
a conspiracy to you?

345
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:08,035
Who, E. T.?
Trust me, he's going
on a long vacation.

346
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:10,637
You can't shove
the facts under the
flag forever, Tate.

347
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:13,912
It's my job to
interpret the facts,
Jake, not yours.

348
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:16,510
Oh, really? Then
what about Alex, huh?

349
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:19,055
Where were the facts
whenever Alex disappeared?

350
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:22,025
You wanna know what
happened to Alex?
I'll tell you, Jake.

351
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,791
He's dead. Evaporated
in that hangar along
with everyone else

352
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,923
thanks to this thing.

353
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,998
Did you kill the men
in the hangar?

354
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:34,561
Did you kill my brother?

355
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:39,407
Answer me!

356
00:45:39,478 --> 00:45:42,276
That's enough, Jake.
That's enough!

357
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:50,219
Kronnan.

358
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:55,183
You need to leave now.

359
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,125
We need you.

360
00:46:05,437 --> 00:46:06,870
<i>Take It down I</i>

361
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,551
What the hell is that thing?

362
00:46:59,624 --> 00:47:02,923
My problem.
You have the
Ether rod.

363
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:04,485
Yes.

364
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:06,532
Make sure he does not get it.

365
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:07,759
What about you?

366
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:11,398
Let's go.

367
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,438
C'mon.

368
00:47:12,505 --> 00:47:14,598
Not so fast, honey.

369
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:20,004
God, I hate fighting women.

370
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:27,778
You okay?

371
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:29,378
Yeah. You okay?

372
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,820
Yeah.

373
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,824
It's changing.

374
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,860
It's missing a gem.

375
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:37,896
Maybe you shouldn't use
the alien space rod as
a night lighter.

376
00:47:37,964 --> 00:47:39,830
Now I remember why we broke.

377
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:24,336
Argh!

378
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,747
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

379
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:16,885
We're missing a gem.

380
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,358
It will not function
without all six gems.

381
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:20,860
Are you sure?

382
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:22,759
Yes.

383
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,060
Get in. C'mon,
c'mon. C'mon.

384
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:35,832
I must have missed
hot-wiring 101.

385
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:39,539
Let's go back to my house.

386
00:50:39,614 --> 00:50:41,479
<i>No, we can jack
one of the Humvees.</i>

387
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:48,454
Sweet.

388
00:52:16,812 --> 00:52:20,248
Left your trail
for us to see you,
Little Red Riding Hood.

389
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:24,581
And I, I am the big bad wolf.

390
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:32,286
The Omega seed
is located in Potosi.

391
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,726
Fifty miles to the south.

392
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,355
What about this missing stone?

393
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:38,196
<i>The Ether rod Is
useless without
all six gems.</i>

394
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:41,498
We must hurry. Kronnan
will attempt to stop us.

395
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,197
What is he?

396
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:46,264
Part of him is what
your technology has
just begun to explore.

397
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:49,435
Quantum physics.
Nano machines,
only refined

398
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:51,877
<i>far beyond your
capabilities.</i>

399
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:54,540
But there is the other side.

400
00:52:54,617 --> 00:52:58,314
The side that most
species I have seen
share. Even yours.

401
00:52:58,388 --> 00:52:59,548
What's that?

402
00:52:59,622 --> 00:53:00,986
Biology.

403
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:03,320
<i>Protected by a
sentient exoskeleton.</i>

404
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:06,293
He can be killed. I've
seen those weapons
that you've got.

405
00:53:06,361 --> 00:53:08,761
You don't have something
that can take him out?

406
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:11,858
This explosive
device can level
an entire building.

407
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,800
<i>It Is useless
against his armour.</i>

408
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:17,601
Only the absence of his
armour will open him
to mortality.

409
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,666
<i>My hydrochloric acid
sphere affected him,</i>

410
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:23,006
but it is not permanent.

411
00:53:24,446 --> 00:53:27,142
H is technology is
simply too strong.

412
00:53:27,216 --> 00:53:30,015
That's it. We just
gotta find the right
can opener.

413
00:53:30,086 --> 00:53:32,179
We have got to find the stone.

414
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:40,184
<i>It's a classified location
In Potosi. I'm sending you
the coordinates now.</i>

415
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:43,226
I want my team
assembled the
moment I get there.

416
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,325
<i>The missing gem
Is closer.</i>

417
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,899
Turn down that road.

418
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:58,634
Great.
A junkyard.

419
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:06,505
So what? We're just gonna
wave the magic stick around
until we hit pay dirt?

420
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:08,478
Have some faith, Monica.

421
00:56:12,616 --> 00:56:13,674
Right.

422
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,514
<i>We must hurry.</i>

423
00:56:49,587 --> 00:56:51,452
N ice hang.

424
00:56:51,523 --> 00:56:57,860
Keep an eye out if there's a
couple of rabid Rottweilers
around this place.

425
00:57:12,477 --> 00:57:14,776
<i>Uh, yeah, nice
car dog.</i>

426
00:57:19,818 --> 00:57:21,149
Holy crap sticks.

427
00:57:23,555 --> 00:57:25,546
Joe?

428
00:57:25,623 --> 00:57:26,885
Who's asking?

429
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:29,222
I'm Jake Townsend.
We're from the base.

430
00:57:29,294 --> 00:57:31,763
Yeah, well, he's
not from the base.

431
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:34,766
No, no, he's not.
He's not, but he's
here to help us.

432
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:37,166
Help us with what?
Halloween?

433
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:38,896
<i>I don't need
no help.</i>

434
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,133
I didn't put up a sign
or nothing. Isn't that
right, Sparky?

435
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:52,076
Look, Joe, have you ever
heard of something called
the Omega seed?

436
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:54,016
Omega.

437
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:59,650
Omega.

438
00:57:59,724 --> 00:58:01,453
No.

439
00:58:01,526 --> 00:58:04,518
Omega vitamins maybe.

440
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:08,089
My wife Ethel made me
take them before she
kicked five years ago.

441
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:11,398
Yeah. Maybe she was
the one who needed
to take the vitamins.

442
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,768
<i>She would nag me
day In and day out...</i>

443
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,670
This is pointless.

444
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:18,232
Yeah, look, Joe,
we're a little
tight on time.

445
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:21,745
<i>We're looking for the
missing piece of a puzzle
that could be lethal.</i>

446
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:24,476
It's just a small
gemstone about the
size of a nickel.

447
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,040
And?

448
00:58:26,118 --> 00:58:27,881
And our friend is here to help.

449
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:30,888
<i>We were just hoping
that you could help
us locate lt.</i>

450
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:35,319
How do you know he's not lying?

451
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:38,363
H is kind killed
people back in the
crashes of '47.

452
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,661
It was the Omega race, not us.

453
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:45,029
Well, you learned how to talk.

454
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,868
<i>You ran off one
of their ships</i>

455
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,669
before we shot you down.

456
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:53,735
<i>We were protecting you.
The casualties were
regrettable.</i>

457
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:56,475
<i>You call straight
from the barracks
friendly fire?</i>

458
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:59,144
You have few hours left.

459
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,482
How do I know we can trust you?

460
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:04,750
Look, Joe, Joe.

461
00:59:04,824 --> 00:59:06,917
He's here to help us.

462
00:59:09,395 --> 00:59:12,489
The aliens had
shot down our back.
We've gotta stop them.

463
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:17,569
Please.

464
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:22,431
Yeah, alright.
C'mon.

465
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:24,738
Captain Kirk stays outside.

466
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:50,400
H is kind shot down
over a dozen planes.
Killed a lot of pilots.

467
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:52,233
Are you sure it was his species?

468
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:55,399
Yes, damn it!
Never question a man
who owns a junkyard.

469
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,171
<i>I'm In touch with
the past, like a
1- 800 psychic.</i>

470
00:59:58,245 --> 01:00:01,146
Look, let's assume
for the moment he's
telling the truth

471
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:04,115
and the casualties
were accidental.
We've seen Kronnan.

472
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:08,018
The other one has killed
dozens of people. Jude has
done nothing but help us.

473
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:10,215
Oh, you have no idea
what he's capable of.

474
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:14,249
Believe me. I have
seen it first hand
when I was a boy.

475
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:18,093
But that's why I spent
my life on that base
doing my father's work.

476
01:00:18,164 --> 01:00:20,928
See? It's
missing a gem.

477
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:22,332
Damn right it is.

478
01:00:22,402 --> 01:00:24,495
So, you know where it is?

479
01:00:24,571 --> 01:00:28,473
Look, you don't
wanna bring those
gems together.

480
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,634
<i>The thing lights up
like a Christmas tree.</i>

481
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,178
It emanates some
kind of radiation.

482
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:37,546
<i>We decided to remove one
of the gems so we could
figure out what It was.</i>

483
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:40,780
Then I took it with me
when I retired as
a safety measure.

484
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,412
So you have it with you.

485
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:47,825
No. I, uh, pawned it
off to buy this place.

486
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,328
You what?

487
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,796
Joe, the Ether rod
can deactivate
the Omega seed

488
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:54,129
but it's no good
without all six gems.

489
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,692
Well, maybe your friend
outside is gonna use it
as a triggering device

490
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:00,969
to blow us all to
smithereens. Have you
ever thought about that?

491
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:03,067
How do you know you
can trust this guy?

492
01:01:03,144 --> 01:01:06,978
Have you had him
over to your house
for Thanksgiving dinner?

493
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:54,922
<i>Did you find
the gem?</i>

494
01:01:54,996 --> 01:01:57,157
It ain't here.

495
01:02:03,204 --> 01:02:05,297
Kronnan.

496
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:09,567
You have any weapons?

497
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,546
Are you kidding?
I may be smart but
I'm still a redneck.

498
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:27,686
Here.

499
01:02:27,763 --> 01:02:30,789
I think we're gonna
need something with
a little more kick.

500
01:02:30,866 --> 01:02:33,357
Think this will do ya?

501
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:47,739
<i>I told ya.</i>

502
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:50,241
Wait!
No!

503
01:02:57,492 --> 01:02:58,788
No, no, no, no.

504
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:09,066
Guys?

505
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:11,497
Guys!

506
01:03:30,225 --> 01:03:31,749
Get out of here.

507
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:33,852
Go!

508
01:03:33,929 --> 01:03:34,918
What about you?

509
01:03:34,996 --> 01:03:36,429
Just go.

510
01:04:07,362 --> 01:04:08,727
Oh-oh.

511
01:04:24,713 --> 01:04:25,975
No!

512
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,149
You killed him.

513
01:05:01,384 --> 01:05:02,510
Get in the vehicle.

514
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,349
No.

515
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,753
Get in the vehicle.
We have to go now.

516
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:10,348
Jake!
Jake!

517
01:05:10,426 --> 01:05:12,257
<i>Jake!</i>

518
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:17,858
No!

519
01:05:19,502 --> 01:05:21,026
Jake!

520
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,070
Whoa.

521
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:08,244
Joe.
Get up.

522
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:11,809
He tried to kill me.
He took the gem. I
told you about him.

523
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,254
He's got your girl.
You've got to stop him

524
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:16,087
from detonating the Omega seed.

525
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:18,127
How?

526
01:06:18,195 --> 01:06:22,097
I don't care how you do it, but
at least get your girl back
before the big kaboom.

527
01:06:27,037 --> 01:06:29,164
We'd better ammo up inside.

528
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:38,678
Put the saw away
if you understand me.

529
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:42,445
Put it away!

530
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:48,915
You might be tough, but
one of these in the face
is gonna do some damage,

531
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:51,461
so you gonna listen
to me. You understand?

532
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:54,497
Good. So, you're
here to protect us?

533
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,829
Stop the Omega seed?

534
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:01,663
How can I trust you?

535
01:07:06,044 --> 01:07:07,944
<i>I am a centurion.</i>

536
01:07:08,012 --> 01:07:11,607
I have pledged my life
to protect this planet
and the Omega seed.

537
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:14,276
The other,
he is a rogue,
a terrorist.

538
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:18,981
<i>The rod he carries Is the
switch that will detonate
the seed and destroy us all.</i>

539
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:21,183
What about those men
and women you killed?

540
01:07:21,258 --> 01:07:23,693
<i>It was they
who attacked me.</i>

541
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:27,925
Do you not have
order on this planet?
Are the rules not the same?

542
01:07:53,858 --> 01:07:56,349
I want heavy artillery
ready within the hour.

543
01:07:56,427 --> 01:07:59,863
Make sure everyone is
loaded with explosive
armour piercing rounds.

544
01:07:59,931 --> 01:08:01,592
That'll slow his ass down.

545
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,826
Yes, Sir.
We're ready.

546
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,663
Establish a blackout as well.

547
01:08:04,736 --> 01:08:07,864
I don't wanna see
any other military faces
here but ours. Am I clear?

548
01:08:07,939 --> 01:08:09,099
Yes, Sir.

549
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:11,266
Move your ass, soldier!

550
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,168
Sir.

551
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:40,128
Jake.

552
01:10:04,724 --> 01:10:06,020
Open fire!

553
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:30,242
Jake is with Kronnan.

554
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:31,937
They're gonna stop you.

555
01:11:35,748 --> 01:11:37,181
No.

556
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,115
Please. Please,
please, please.

557
01:11:43,423 --> 01:11:45,085
Take it.

558
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:49,394
You never told us
the exact location,
correct?

559
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:50,555
No.

560
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:54,361
Take the Ether rod and go there.

561
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:57,028
I do not know where
the Omega seed is.
Kronnan does.

562
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,765
It was his species
that created it,
not mine.

563
01:11:59,839 --> 01:12:01,773
Then why is Kronnan chasing us?

564
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:05,334
To get the Ether rod.
To prevent the shutdown.

565
01:12:07,214 --> 01:12:08,340
Take it.

566
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:16,248
To deactivate the Omega seed

567
01:12:16,322 --> 01:12:19,348
you must slide
the Ether rod into
the terminating port.

568
01:12:19,425 --> 01:12:22,623
I beg you.
Go and do it
immediately.

569
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:24,789
How do I know it
won't detonate it?

570
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:30,162
If you do not trust
me, wait until Kronnan
reaches the Omega seed.

571
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:31,898
Then you will know the truth.

572
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,108
Please, go.

573
01:12:37,177 --> 01:12:41,876
Time is running out. I will
delay Kronnan long enough for
you to do what is necessary.

574
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:43,974
Please.

575
01:13:20,154 --> 01:13:21,712
What are you doing?

576
01:13:28,495 --> 01:13:31,556
Go! She's on
the path. Hurry!

577
01:14:32,794 --> 01:14:34,386
Jude?

578
01:14:59,355 --> 01:15:00,879
Jude?

579
01:15:06,494 --> 01:15:08,655
Oh! Ow!

580
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,960
Jake!

581
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,994
Are you okay?

582
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:16,560
Yeah. I'm fine.

583
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:19,870
Jude saved my life.
I can't believe I
trusted Kronnan.

584
01:15:19,942 --> 01:15:21,637
We have a job to do.

585
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,541
How much further?

586
01:15:23,612 --> 01:15:24,943
Just over the ridge.

587
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:26,708
What do we do when we get there?

588
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:30,308
Jude said we have
to connect this to
the terminating port.

589
01:15:30,385 --> 01:15:32,354
Whatever that means.

590
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:34,355
One port is the off switch.

591
01:15:34,423 --> 01:15:36,823
The other detonates us all.

592
01:15:38,194 --> 01:15:39,422
Great.

593
01:17:02,712 --> 01:17:03,872
That's it?

594
01:17:03,947 --> 01:17:05,244
I don't know.

595
01:17:05,315 --> 01:17:07,476
It's a little anticlimactic.

596
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:01,302
There it is.

597
01:18:03,306 --> 01:18:05,570
Oh, my God.

598
01:18:22,092 --> 01:18:23,650
<i>Give me a hand here.</i>

599
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:56,860
Going down?

600
01:18:58,595 --> 01:18:59,755
Going down.

601
01:18:59,829 --> 01:19:01,354
Be careful.

602
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:09,200
Jake!

603
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:24,787
Wow.

604
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:34,626
Wow.

605
01:19:34,698 --> 01:19:38,191
It's okay.
It's some sort of
air duct or something.

606
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:39,897
<i>I think It's safe.</i>

607
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:44,800
That's what you
said when we went
hand-gliding in Cabo.

608
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:13,532
Stop it.

609
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:55,473
The Omega seed.

610
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:03,843
It's supposed to reach
all the way down to
the Earth's core.

611
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,908
From the looks of it,
we don't have much
time. Let's go.

612
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:09,079
This way.

613
01:22:57,937 --> 01:22:59,734
Can I see it for a moment?

614
01:23:05,445 --> 01:23:07,504
Start looking for
the terminating port.

615
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:09,014
What does it look like?

616
01:23:09,082 --> 01:23:11,710
No idea.

617
01:23:11,785 --> 01:23:13,946
Oh, well, then
this should be
a piece of cake.

618
01:23:15,388 --> 01:23:16,946
Wait a second.

619
01:23:19,992 --> 01:23:21,654
<i>The symbols.</i>

620
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:25,789
Did you find a match?

621
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:29,364
Maybe.

622
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:31,192
Ah!

623
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:00,986
The Ether rod.

624
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:02,619
Where is it?

625
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,940
<i>The Ether rod.</i>

626
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:17,307
Kronnan!

627
01:27:42,959 --> 01:27:44,722
Jake!

628
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:56,229
Jude!

629
01:27:56,305 --> 01:27:57,863
No!

630
01:28:25,368 --> 01:28:26,835
This is the one.

631
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:45,645
Stop the seed.

632
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:50,586
Help.
Help me.

633
01:30:14,244 --> 01:30:15,575
Wait.

634
01:30:34,732 --> 01:30:36,222
Thank you.

635
01:30:43,307 --> 01:30:44,399
C'mon.

636
01:31:04,762 --> 01:31:06,252
C'mon.

637
01:31:08,098 --> 01:31:09,690
Right over here.
Over here.

638
01:31:11,936 --> 01:31:13,096
Hurry.

639
01:31:16,808 --> 01:31:19,834
C'mon. C'mon.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

640
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:04,421
I'm sorry about Alex.

641
01:32:05,758 --> 01:32:07,385
Thanks.

642
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,558
He was so, so proud of you.

643
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:13,153
Do you think so?

644
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:14,789
Oh.

645
01:32:14,866 --> 01:32:17,357
I, I know so.

646
01:32:24,844 --> 01:32:26,778
I'm proud of you, too.

647
01:32:26,846 --> 01:32:29,576
Yeah? Well, you didn't
do so bad yourself.

648
01:32:37,689 --> 01:32:39,851
Did you really throw
a whole career for me?

649
01:32:41,227 --> 01:32:42,990
Would it matter if I didn't?

650
01:32:45,397 --> 01:32:46,989
No.
