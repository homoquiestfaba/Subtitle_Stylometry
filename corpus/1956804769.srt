00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,073
Get out.

547
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,712
Don't you know a
goddamn vintage fucking

548
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,748
automobile when you see one?

549
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,049
I guess.

550
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:39,984
You don't guess.

551
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,553
It is.

552
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:45,022
Do you have any idea why it
looks as good as it does?

553
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,659
Cause I don't zoom it around
like some goddamn Hot Wheels.

554
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,729
I take care of it, which
is possibly a concept

555
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,230
that you can't understand.

556
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,699
Sounds like fucking
Chinese to you, don't it?

557
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:58,803
You ain't got the slightest
idea what in the world

558
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,272
respect means, do you, huh?

559
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,774
Well, let me give
you a little fact.

560
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,277
That's why the world
is turning to shit.

561
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:09,613
Because you kids, you got
no respect for nothing...

562
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,415
No respect.
Nothing lasts.

563
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,917
You got no Sinatras.

564
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,652
You got no Elvises.

565
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,353
You got nothing.

566
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,022
Here today, gone tomorrow.

567
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:21,759
It's all just... it's all just
a quick fix, no tradition.

568
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,034
Now you give me my money back.

569
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:28,867
Get a haircut.

570
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,805
Yo, how much time
before the fourth race?

571
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:35,739
Just went off.

572
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,041
Who won?

573
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,610
Sudden Fury, that
fucking pig bastard.

574
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,089
Fuck.

575
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,097
Is Sal here, Jack?

576
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,565
Yeah.

577
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,566
He's in his office.

578
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,602
Thanks, Jack.

579
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,845
Sal?

580
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,946
SAL: (SINGING) Oh.

581
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,749
Come, darling.

582
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,184
Oh.

583
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,585
Sal?

584
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,786
SAL: What?

585
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,022
What do you want?

586
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,057
Speak.

587
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,795
I want to make a loan.

588
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,730
SAL: A loan?

589
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,366
For what?

590
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,001
I don't know.

591
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,470
I... I got some
things I want to do.

592
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,206
SAL: Well, what kind of things?

593
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,174
Things, like...

594
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,821
SAL: Why are you
being so evasive?

595
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:49,113
You trying to hide
something from me, Fly?

596
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,148
How much you want?

597
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:54,051
$6,000.

598
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:54,919
SAL: Oh, god.

599
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,387
That's enough.

600
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,422
That's enough.

601
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,130
Oh.

602
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,976
You have no future
in show business.

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,899
Can I try again?

604
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:09,833
I'll get it right.

605
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,213
I promise.
- No.

606
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,237
Get out.

607
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,710
Maybe I made her nervous.

608
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,011
Huh?

609
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,680
She's got teeth like a beaver.

610
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:30,120
[laughs] That's a
lot of money, Fly.

611
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:33,624
[inaudible]

612
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:41,659
[laughs] Oh, Mickey lost his
nuts for a lot less than that.

613
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:45,369
I'm not looking to lose
my nuts, you know, Sal?

614
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,415
You know what I mean?

615
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,271
Yeah.

616
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,572
Hey, come on.

617
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,808
I'm not planning to
lose my nuts, Sal.

618
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:51,843
Huh?

619
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:56,580
Yeah, well, neither was he.

620
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,856
You should have seen his face.

621
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,588
I'll do this for you,
Fly, because I like you.

622
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:09,059
Hey, I like you.

623
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:10,861
What are you, queer?

624
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,274
Come on, no.
What are you doing?

625
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,197
What are you doing?

626
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,131
[laughs]

627
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,267
I'm just checking.

628
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,702
When do you want it?

629
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:21,572
I want it now.

630
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:26,477
I hope for your sake, you're
spend your money wisely.

631
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,480
I hate to see you make a
bad investment, you know?

632
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:33,984
Well, I appreciate this, Sal.

633
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,619
Thanks.

634
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:39,056
Don't make me spot you, Fly.

635
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,091
I'll spot you bad.

636
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:46,742
I heard the results
on the radio...

637
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:47,631
$6,230.

638
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,266
Jesus Christ.

639
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,461
I almost came in my pants.

640
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,939
You fucking counting?

641
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,207
I mean, it's all there.

642
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,142
I just want to feel it.

643
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,177
Do you mind?

644
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,025
Where do you think Margaret is?

645
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:05,783
Hopefully at the
vets, getting shots.

646
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,429
Hey, try to be
nice, will you, Joey?

647
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:08,453
She's a nice girl.

648
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,120
Sure she is, Frankie.

649
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,955
She's a fucking junkie.

650
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,071
What the fuck are you?

651
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:16,994
Touche.

652
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,595
Then you.

653
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:20,208
Should heed my words even
more closely, my friend...

654
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:22,132
Once a junkie, always a junkie.

655
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,368
It's just a matter of degree.

656
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,703
We still got a deal, right?

657
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,782
Of courses we got a deal, Fly.

658
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,105
A deal is a deal.

659
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,841
Don't call me Fly.
My name is Frankie.

660
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,017
You really going
to do this for me?

661
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,052
Why not?

662
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:46,557
And Joey's going to go along?

663
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,625
Loves the idea.

664
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:49,560
Loves?

665
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,595
Loves the idea.

666
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,032
What about Sal?

667
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:02,306
Yeah, well, we're
going to kind of like not

668
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:05,209
tell Sal till we got
a more solid story.

669
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:10,848
You're getting my hopes up
again, Frankie, you know that?

670
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:14,885
Hey, you got to
have hopes, right?

671
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,721
Oh, it sure would be nice...

672
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,891
Get a good piece of
tape of myself, who

673
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,627
people what I can do, you know?

674
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:27,097
Be like the next Jodie Foster.

675
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:32,736
Yeah, maybe, although she
was awful good in that movie,

676
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:37,574
um, the one where
the guy ate people.

677
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,276
I can do that kind of stuff.

678
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,245
Eat people?

679
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,180
No, drama things.

680
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,314
Oh.

681
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,961
No, I'm not saying
that you can't.

682
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:47,562
Because that's what I came
out here to do, you know,

683
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,086
serious things like...

684
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,587
I know.

685
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm not just some low
life who's got no talent.

686
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:59,229
I know that Hey, timing
is everything, right?

687
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,665
Maybe this is our time...

688
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,135
Make some noise in this town.

689
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,105
Yeah.

690
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,106
It is.

691
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,274
What's the matter?

692
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,875
I'm fine.

693
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,677
Hey, you OK?

694
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,113
I just... I don't feel...

695
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,362
What... Margaret?
Margaret?

696
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,251
Margaret?

697
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,086
Oh.
My god.

698
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:24,288
Oh, my god.

699
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,722
Oh, shit.

700
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,091
Somebody call an ambulance!

701
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,660
Hey, you OK?

702
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,695
Come on, Margaret, please.

703
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,564
Don't do this.

704
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,631
Someone hurry up.

705
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:41,004
Hurry the fuck up, will ya?

706
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,940
[door opening]

707
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:43,907
Is there a problem here?

708
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,175
FRANKIE: Look.

709
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,645
I'd like a little
more coffee, please.

710
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,013
What are you doing?

711
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,183
You were just dead there.
- We're fine.

712
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,819
I'd just like a little
more decaf, please.

713
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:56,787
Yeah.

714
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:57,822
Yeah.

715
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,027
What the hell was
that all about?

716
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:05,762
I was good, wasn't I?

717
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:08,665
You give me a freaking
heart attack here.

718
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,801
I told you I could do drama.

719
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,804
Nah, it's not funny, Margaret.

720
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,106
You scared the shit out of me.

721
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,507
I was just playing.

722
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,043
Yeah, well, don't play
with people's hearts.

723
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,012
Oh.

724
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,348
Oh, I'm sorry.

725
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,383
I'm sorry, Frankie.

726
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:36,895
Hey, buddy.

727
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,203
Hey.

728
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,070
Hey.

729
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,172
Hey Here you go.

730
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,208
Be right back.

731
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:05,889
Hey, buddy.

732
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,885
Get the door for
the lady, will you?

733
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,763
Thank you.

734
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,446
Well, thanks for dinner.

735
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,781
It was great.

736
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:33,617
It was the best I've
had in a long time.

737
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:37,220
Well, hopefully we'll be
able to do that again sometime.

738
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,389
I would love that.

739
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,069
And I'll behave.
I promise.

740
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:41,925
Oh, yeah.

741
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:42,859
Great.

742
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,661
All the luck, huh?

743
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:45,829
OK.

744
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:46,830
See ya.

745
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:47,865
See ya.

746
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:53,437
Hey.

747
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,372
OK.

748
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,274
Good night and sleep tight.

749
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,787
And don't let the bed bugs bite.
- OK.

750
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,811
OK?

751
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,158
All right.

752
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,761
Whoa!

753
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:18,796
Huh.

754
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,267
Ah!

755
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,303
Whew.

756
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:12,115
Hell, I see you
all are bent to...

757
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,017
OK.

758
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,653
Oh, hell, I see that
you all are bent to set

759
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,388
against me in your merriment.

760
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,996
Can you not hate me,
as I know you do?

761
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,464
Then...

762
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,543
MAN: Shut the fuck up, lady.

763
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,567
Hey.

764
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,874
Can you... can you not
hate me, as I know you do?

765
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,910
But you was...

766
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,081
[muttering]

767
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:00,230
Oh.

768
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,232
What are you writing...

769
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,733
Secrets?

770
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,902
Nah.

771
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:08,738
Ideas.

772
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,207
Ideas?

773
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,609
Yeah, ideas.

774
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:15,212
Well, what kind of ideas?

775
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,180
I don't know.

776
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,583
What do you mean, I don't know?

777
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,728
What, are you a fucking parrot?

778
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,886
I said I don't know.

779
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,254
How could you not know?

780
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,656
They're your ideas.

781
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:30,060
Because they haven't
come to me yet, you see?

782
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:32,095
That's what an idea is.

783
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:37,267
It's something you don't
know but comes to you.

784
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,969
Comes to you how?

785
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,403
It's an idea.

786
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,283
Well, how can an idea
come to you if you're

787
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,740
not thinking of something?

788
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:46,109
Oh, I'm thinking of something.

789
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:46,977
What?

790
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,745
An idea.

791
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,915
Fly, [inaudible] one more
fucking time, and I'll slap

792
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,317
your fucking head in.

793
00:35:54,353 --> 00:36:00,023
Look, did anybody ever say to
you, don't get any ideas, huh?

794
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,091
Of course.

795
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,259
OK.

796
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:03,534
So what does that mean to you?

797
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,498
Tell me.

798
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,967
All right.

799
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,135
What it means is this.

800
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,641
Don't think anything.

801
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:21,311
Now that doesn't necessarily
mean that you're thinking

802
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,813
anything in particular.

803
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,784
It means don't
think anything new.

804
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,656
And that also does not assume
that you have any old ideas.

805
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,458
Because you can actually be
thinking of nothing, g you know,

806
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,027
just space out.

807
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:42,232
And then suddenly when you
least expect it, an idea...

808
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,968
Huh... pops up.

809
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,536
Because it's what ideas do...

810
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,604
They pop up.

811
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,239
And that's what I'm doing here.

812
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:54,211
You know, sitting here,
waiting for an idea,

813
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,645
thinking of nothing.

814
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,681
Capisce?

815
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,885
I get it.

816
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,155
Hey, I got an idea.

817
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,022
Yeah.

818
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,791
Get me a fucking drink.

819
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:08,692
Hey, there you go.

820
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,826
See, that's an idea.

821
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,027
And that gives me an idea.

822
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:11,895
Fuck you.

823
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:12,829
Get it yourself.

824
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,030
You see how it works.

825
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,765
[laughs]

826
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:19,970
That's very good,
Fly, very good.

827
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:24,574
Problem is that wasn't
a very good idea.

828
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,743
See how it works?

829
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:27,944
You're right.

830
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,579
What would you like?

831
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:30,880
The usual.

832
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,315
Good.

833
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:36,219
Then if you'll excuse me
now, I'll be right back.

834
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,291
Excused.

835
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,197
Hey, Jack.

836
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,198
Yeah.

837
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,393
Give me a scotch, will ya?

838
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:56,273
Do me a favor.

839
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,907
Piss in it.

840
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,943
I already pissed in the bottle.

841
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,589
Don't want to
dilute it too much.

842
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,380
[chuckle]

843
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,154
Left some of your
empties on the set.

844
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,109
If Fly comes by,
tell him to wait.

845
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,265
[door closing]

846
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,127
Here.

847
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,630
Really?

848
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,031
I think so, I'll go tell him.

849
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,067
Yo.

850
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:02,973
Yo, Sal.

851
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,314
[car honking]

852
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,791
[coins in pay phone]

853
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,830
Come on.

854
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,333
Pick up the phone.

855
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,369
Goddamn it, Fly.

856
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,807
Fuck.

857
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:40,710
[car honking]

858
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,325
Hey, Joe.

859
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,826
JOEY: Frankie.

860
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,339
I've been coming up with
some pretty good ideas.

861
00:39:58,363 --> 00:40:00,174
You got to place a
couple of more bets for me.

862
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:03,566
Hey, Joey, I don't think
we ought to push our luck.

863
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,002
Frankie, someone has finally
taken the fucking needles

864
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,470
out of my goddamn voodoo doll.

865
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:09,506
You know what you ought to do?

866
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,142
You give Sal what you got
and don't be fucking greedy.

867
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:13,042
Greedy?

868
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,244
I'm not fucking greedy.

869
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,857
It's that cocksucker
who is greedy.

870
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,425
Frankie, I'm just trying
to get out of here.

871
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,915
Yeah, at my expense.

872
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,194
No.
No.

873
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,929
He ain't going to
do nothing to you.

874
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,698
If he's going to do anything to
anybody, he's going to hang me.

875
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,221
I'm an accomplice.

876
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,224
To him, it's just as bad.

877
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,338
Do you like like begging
people to make bets for me?

878
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,706
Joey, I don't know.
Come on.

879
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,774
What are you doing?
- Come on, Fly.

880
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,164
You got to do this for me.

881
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,499
What did I tell you
about calling me Fly?

882
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,201
I mean Frankie...

883
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,836
Frankie.

884
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,549
Frankie, he's going to bury
me in this piece of shit.

885
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,706
He's a scumbag.

886
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,942
I can't have a life
with this scumbag.

887
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,455
Please.
Please.

888
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,378
Please.

889
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,279
Please.

890
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,346
OK.

891
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,383
OK, on one condition, all right?

892
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,952
You know this script that
I'm writing for Margaret?

893
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:57,454
Yeah.

894
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,723
I want to direct it, too.

895
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,392
Well, yeah.

896
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:03,626
Yeah, sure.

897
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,295
That's a great idea.

898
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,542
And I don't mean none of
these porno flicks, neither.

899
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,731
No.

900
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:09,767
No.

901
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,701
We're talking an epic, a saga.

902
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:13,114
Look, Frankie, you
can write, direct,

903
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,771
hold the lights for all I care.

904
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,417
I'll just... I'll just be there
to guide you and help you

905
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,740
when you need me.

906
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,242
Please just make the bet.

907
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:22,412
And we don't tell Sal nothing?

908
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,982
We don't tell Sal
a fucking thing.

909
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,518
The movie, you and I, we
make it on our free time.

910
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,187
We just use that
cocksucker's film.

911
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:32,088
OK.

912
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,990
All right.

913
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,458
Whatever you want.

914
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,638
Ah, Frankie, I knew
you wouldn't let me down.

915
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,862
I got two horses...

916
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:41,197
One in the six and
one in the eight.

917
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,668
[truck honking]

918
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:51,140
[tire popping]

919
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,886
You're trying to tell
me something, ain't you?

920
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,910
Huh?

921
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,658
RACE ANNOUNCER:
Out of the stretch,

922
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,326
it's Hurly Burly, Happy Time,
[inaudible] neck to neck.

923
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,316
It's Hurly Burly.
- No.

924
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,717
No.

925
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,163
Now shut them the fucking down.
Shut them down.

926
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,231
Shut them down.
Shut them.

927
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,054
Yes!
Yes!

928
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,822
Yes!
I love you.

929
00:42:39,858 --> 00:42:40,690
I love you.

930
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,492
Everything all right?

931
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,893
Yes.

932
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,195
This is amazing.

933
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,399
It's going to be the first
porno ever to get an Oscar.

934
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,112
I'm not kidding
you... just awesome.

935
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:52,402
Here, look.

936
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:53,648
[inaudible] going to
like my work here.

937
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:56,005
Ha!

938
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,740
Son of a bitch.

939
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,208
Brilliant.

940
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,144
Brilliant.

941
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,645
Here she is, yeah.

942
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:03,580
Slow down.

943
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:05,415
[honking]

944
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,653
Vic.

945
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,689
Hey, what are you
doing around here?

946
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,391
Actually, we was
looking for you, Margaret.

947
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,392
- Yeah?
- Come on.

948
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:17,428
Get in.

949
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:22,199
Hey.

950
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,070
Hey, doing a little shopping?

951
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,938
Ah, looking mostly...

952
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:30,273
Picked up a little scarf.

953
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,140
Oh.

954
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:34,243
[chuckle] That's nice.

955
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,424
It's good that those things will
make you feel good [inaudible],

956
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,347
huh?

957
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,115
Where we going?

958
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,584
Uh, Sal wants to see you.

959
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
About what?

960
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:45,823
Didn't say.

961
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,264
Hey, you all right?

962
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,132
Yeah.

963
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,167
I'm fine.

964
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,404
No work today?

965
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,573
Down time.

966
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,942
Got my period.

967
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:06,909
Oh.

968
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:09,812
Yeah.

969
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,592
It's good to have a
legitimate excuse to take

970
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,883
some time off from work, right?

971
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:16,719
Vic, what's going on?

972
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,654
Huh.

973
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,989
Oh, that?

974
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,692
He's just checking out the
texture of some new stuff.

975
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,261
That's all.

976
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:29,165
Vic, why don't you pull
over and let me out, OK?

977
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,768
I can't do that.

978
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:33,403
Why not?

979
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:35,471
I told you.

980
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,517
Sal wants to see you.

981
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:39,142
Why does he want to see me?

982
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:44,447
Well, Margaret,
Sal is a funny guy.

983
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:48,084
I can't really figure him
out sometimes, you know?

984
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,955
I think he went a little
cuckoo when his old man died.

985
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:56,559
It's like he's afraid of change,
likes things to stay the same.

986
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:02,198
Yeah, well, sometimes
change is good.

987
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,501
Personally, I agree with you.

988
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:11,607
But I also think there's
a time and a place.

989
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,209
How about a little music, huh?

990
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:14,911
Want some music?

991
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:16,446
Vic.

992
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,014
Go on, feel it.

993
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,282
Enjoy the music.

994
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,561
Have a little
something with us, huh?

995
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:21,884
Come on, Vinny.

996
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,486
Come on.

997
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,387
[inaudible].

998
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,354
Stop, Vic.

999
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,857
Stop it.

1000
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,426
Stop it, goddammit.

1001
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:31,462
There you go.

1002
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:35,398
Come on.

1003
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,433
Come on.

1004
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,244
That's better.

1005
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,570
[knock]

1006
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,361
[buzzer]

1007
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,075
SAL: Hello, Joey.

1008
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:54,477
Sal.

1009
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,956
If I'd known you were
coming by, I would have

1010
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,480
brought you a cup of coffee.

1011
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:58,548
Oh, thanks a lot.

1012
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,750
That's very thoughtful of you.

1013
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,552
You want mine?

1014
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:03,667
I don't drink coffee.

1015
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,526
So what brings you around, Sal?

1016
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:11,994
Why don't you sit down?

1017
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,363
You look kind of tense.

1018
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:15,798
Me, tense?

1019
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,767
Oh, I'm fine.

1020
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,235
I'm fine.

1021
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,670
Sit down!

1022
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:22,672
OK, I'll sit down.

1023
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,300
Doing a little
reading, have you?

1024
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:34,884
You mean this?

1025
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:35,785
No.

1026
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,086
No.

1027
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,087
I just like to test
myself, you know,

1028
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:38,955
and see how I've been doing.

1029
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,358
It's nothing.

1030
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:45,161
What do you use to play
with, Monopoly money?

1031
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:50,533
[low chuckle]

1032
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:54,370
So... so what are
you doing here, Sal?

1033
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,649
You already asked me that once.

1034
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,173
You think I'm hard of hearing?

1035
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,107
No.

1036
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,408
No.

1037
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,944
I mean it's just that,
you know, I mean,

1038
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,814
you never come down here.

1039
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,483
I hear everything, Joey.

1040
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:11,220
I got what's known
as 20/20 hearing.

1041
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,990
[laughs]

1042
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:15,958
20... 20/20 hearing...

1043
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,326
That's a good one, Sal.

1044
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,995
That's really funny.

1045
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,463
Is it?

1046
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,399
Is it funny?

1047
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,579
Sometimes I have trouble
distinguishing what's funny

1048
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,904
and what's not.

1049
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:31,107
I never know.

1050
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,053
Maybe you can help me
out with something.

1051
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,077
Sure.

1052
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:41,584
Want you to listen to this
and tell me whether or not

1053
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,659
you think it's funny.

1054
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:59,101
(JOEY'S VOICE ON TAPE) He's
the dirtiest piece of shit.

1055
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:00,703
He's a scumbag.

1056
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:03,039
I can't have a life
in this scumbag.

1057
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:04,551
Please.
Please.

1058
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,441
Please.

1059
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,909
Please.

1060
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,355
(FRANKIE'S VOICE ON
TAPE) OK, one condition...

1061
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,780
You know the script I'm
writing for Margaret?

1062
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,114
I want to direct it, too.

1063
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,894
(JOEY'S VOICE ON
TAPE) Frankie, an epic,

1064
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,130
a saga... you can write, direct,
hold the lights for all I care.

1065
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:18,454
I'll just... I'll just
be there to guide you.

1066
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:20,122
Please just make the bet.

1067
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:22,236
(FRANKIE'S VOICE ON TAPE)
And we don't tell Sal nothing?

1068
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,027
(JOEY'S VOICE ON TAPE) We
don't tell Sal a fucking thing.

1069
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,174
The move... you and I, we
make it on our free time.

1070
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,158
We just use that
cocksucker's film.

1071
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,878
Is that funny?

1072
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:48,751
No, Sal, that
definitely is not funny.

1073
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:49,786
I didn't think so.

1074
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,803
My gosh.

1075
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,605
[chuckles]

1076
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,343
Man, a microphone.

1077
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,290
Even the cocks have
ears around here.

1078
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:22,718
[chuckling] Now that's funny.

1079
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:40,136
Hey, it's Roman Polanski.

1080
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,606
[chuckling] Come on.

1081
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,342
Hey, Sal.

1082
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,477
What's up?

1083
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:51,981
I hear that you
want to make a movie.

1084
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,360
[moaning]
Come on.

1085
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,250
What's the matter?

1086
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:57,286
You got stage fright?

1087
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,321
Is she OK?

1088
00:50:58,356 --> 00:50:59,221
SAL: Oh, yeah.

1089
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,389
She's fine.

1090
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,336
We just gave her
something to relax

1091
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,560
her a little bit to get her...

1092
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,899
You guys grab Fly
and sit him down.

1093
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:11,967
Give him a comfortable seat.

1094
00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:13,702
I want him to see the show.

1095
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,570
But Sal, I...

1096
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,338
Not a word...

1097
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:17,584
I'm going to do
you a favor and not

1098
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:21,210
allow you to say
one fucking word,

1099
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,245
because you're
just going to lie.

1100
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:27,416
And it's going to
jeopardize our friendship.

1101
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:30,920
Now where is Joey's money?

1102
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,421
I mean my money.

1103
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:35,357
Oh, it's... it's in my pocket.

1104
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:38,127
Well, get it out.

1105
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:41,564
I don't like to
wait for answers.

1106
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,401
Well, you know, I
didn't mean you no wrong.

1107
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,070
Well, yes you did.

1108
00:51:48,106 --> 00:51:49,004
No.

1109
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,873
You broke a trust.

1110
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,576
And that is a big no-no.

1111
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,444
Oh.

1112
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,514
$6,000.

1113
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,884
[grunting]

1114
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,719
You're a little short, Fly.

1115
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:05,588
That's all I got.

1116
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,923
SAL: That's all you got?

1117
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:12,294
[chuckling] Well, we've got
a little problem here then.

1118
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:20,102
According to my sources, uh,
you're about $146,000 short.

1119
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,937
Well, I fucked up.

1120
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:24,140
I got a flat on the way track.

1121
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,442
And... and I didn't
get there in time,

1122
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,145
you know, to make the bets.

1123
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,815
[laughs] You fucked up.

1124
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,150
You fucked up.

1125
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,684
You got a flat.

1126
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,797
Oh, I see now.
I understand.

1127
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:37,821
OK.

1128
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,889
Well, it's only money, right?

1129
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,790
We'll just forget all about it.

1130
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,237
But I don't think
so, because we'd

1131
00:52:43,261 --> 00:52:47,329
been missing a golden
opportunity to look

1132
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:51,000
into our souls and
search our hearts

1133
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:55,538
and ask ourselves,
why did this happen?

1134
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,739
Why?

1135
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:00,309
I must I ask
myself, who is going

1136
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,055
to benefit the most from
this little demonstration

1137
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,680
here today?

1138
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,015
Certainly not Joey...

1139
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,684
I mean, let's face
it, it's over for him.

1140
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,888
[laughs] He's not in control.

1141
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:14,990
Not only that, but
you know, he's...

1142
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,225
He's a scum.

1143
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:21,831
Hey.

1144
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:36,712
Now, I think you will
know never go against me

1145
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:39,081
again for something like that.

1146
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:45,154
That is a pig, Fly.

1147
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,655
Sal, please.

1148
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:49,758
She didn't have nothing
to do with this, nothing.

1149
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:50,893
Oh, you're wrong.

1150
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:52,573
She had everything
to do with it.

1151
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:55,130
She corrupted your mind.

1152
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,000
She... she... she... blinded you,
much more so than you even

1153
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,035
realize.

1154
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:05,574
She's the reason you
were going to fuck me.

1155
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,876
No, Sal, you're wrong.

1156
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,044
You're wrong.

1157
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,614
I'm... I'm... I'm
never wrong, Fly.

1158
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,360
I'm going to show you
what a pig she is.

1159
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,629
And after that, we're going to
play a little guessing game.

1160
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:17,920
It's called Who's
Nuts are in the Jar?

1161
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,589
Give him the jar.

1162
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:24,059
Whose name you think is
going to be on there?

1163
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:26,562
Joey?

1164
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,563
You?

1165
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,064
FRANKIE: Sal, please.

1166
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,533
How do you think they're
going to look, all cold

1167
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,936
and shriveled up?

1168
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:38,073
Maybe they'll be magnified
because they're in the glass.

1169
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:40,476
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

1170
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,382
Sit her up.

1171
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,588
[moans]

1172
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,423
OK, Fly.

1173
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,578
I want you to watch this.

1174
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,467
Turn him around.

1175
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,738
Look how good she is, Fly.

1176
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,373
She loves it.

1177
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,909
And... and... and... and I love it.

1178
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:20,516
[laughs] Open your fucking eyes.

1179
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,455
Everybody, look
at the movie star.

1180
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,490
No.

1181
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:36,665
Volare!

1182
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:37,599
Piss on her.

1183
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:40,336
Oh.

1184
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:45,574
Yo, what about him?

1185
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:47,476
Fucking blind him.

1186
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:54,216
[grunting]

1187
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:02,925
Make him a cyclops.

1188
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,795
If he ever fucks with me again,
we'll take out the other one,

1189
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:09,031
see how much vision he has then.

1190
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:20,209
[grunting]

1191
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:28,150
[yelling]

1192
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,024
Let's go for a ride.

1193
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,913
Your hands look kind of...
Kind of tight and tense

1194
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:50,272
on that wheel there, Fly.

1195
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:54,276
That happens to me
sometimes, too, usually

1196
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:58,347
when I want to kill somebody.

1197
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:02,317
You want to kill
somebody, don't you, Fly?

1198
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:05,721
You want to kill
somebody like me?

1199
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,124
Now be honest.

1200
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,203
You want to kill me, don't you?

1201
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:12,895
Say it.

1202
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,963
Say it.

1203
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,376
Say it.
- Yes.

1204
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,840
Yes.
Yes.

1205
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,470
Ha.

1206
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,780
It'll pass.

1207
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:41,290
[chuckles] I appreciate
your honesty, I must say.

1208
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:42,803
But do you know, I'm
doing you a favor.

1209
00:57:42,827 --> 00:57:44,871
You'll realize in the
long run that this writing

1210
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,095
thing is no good for you.

1211
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,232
You're just setting yourself
up to get hurt, setting

1212
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:51,967
yourself up for disappointment.

1213
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:08,350
Fly, nobody made
Margaret do drugs.

1214
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:15,924
She did that on her
own, because she's weak.

1215
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,126
Weak people will always
go back to doing what

1216
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:21,630
they do best, what they know.

1217
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:27,035
Why don't you take a
couple of days off,

1218
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:30,539
figure out what you want to be...

1219
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:36,445
One of the wolves
or one of the sheep?

1220
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,757
[phone ringing]

1221
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:54,222
[pool balls breaking]

1222
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,593
There he is.

1223
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,294
Thought you'd died.

1224
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,229
What, are you disappointed?

1225
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,266
Hey, maybe a little.

1226
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,301
Shut up, Vic.

1227
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,872
How are you feeling?

1228
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:13,709
Yeah, fine.

1229
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,577
Want to play?

1230
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:16,578
Nah.

1231
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:20,349
I don't really feel like it.

1232
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,150
How about washing my car?

1233
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,552
Do you feel like doing that?

1234
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:24,587
Yeah, sure.

1235
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:30,593
Thanks.

1236
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:48,444
Margaret?

1237
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,181
Margaret?

1238
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,467
Yo, baby.

1239
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,470
Hey, your name?

1240
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:16,471
Frankie.

1241
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:17,939
I'm looking for Margaret.

1242
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:18,940
Have you seen her?

1243
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:19,941
Yeah, I saw her.

1244
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:21,443
She's over by [inaudible].

1245
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:22,444
Garrison Bridge?

1246
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:23,445
All right, thanks.

1247
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,446
Uh-huh.

1248
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:25,447
Later.

1249
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:26,482
Bye.

1250
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:32,821
[truck honking]

1251
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,128
[honking]

1252
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,699
Woo-ee.

1253
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:20,535
You got the big man's car.

1254
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,037
Fly man is big time.

1255
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:22,971
Come on.

1256
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:23,905
Get in.

1257
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,841
You lonely, baby?

1258
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:26,842
Do you want some company?

1259
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,254
Yeah.
Yeah.

1260
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:29,278
Get in.

1261
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,293
You're [inaudible], huh?

1262
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,900
I didn't know you
was kinky, Fly.

1263
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,902
Hm?

1264
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:54,981
- Kinky Fly.
- No.

1265
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:55,904
No.

1266
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,273
Put your clothes on.

1267
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:00,208
Hey.

1268
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:01,543
Isn't this what you want?

1269
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,211
Hm?

1270
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:04,412
What you always wanted?

1271
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:08,683
Yeah, but not like
this, all right?

1272
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,085
Hey, baby.

1273
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,721
I'm sorry.

1274
01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:13,789
How's the Fly want?

1275
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:16,424
Hey, don't call me Fly, please.

1276
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,793
All right?

1277
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:20,228
Come on, baby.

1278
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:23,131
Come on.

1279
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,099
Margaret.

1280
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,134
Yeah?

1281
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:28,470
Margaret.

1282
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:29,771
Shh.

1283
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:30,705
Yeah.

1284
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,107
Margaret.

1285
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,508
Oh, that's it.

1286
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:34,476
Yeah.

1287
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,844
That's the prize.

1288
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,583
You read the Bible,
huh, Frankie?

1289
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:43,585
Yeah, sometimes.

1290
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,723
Well, like it says in Psalm
23, the Lord is your shepherd.

1291
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,792
And you shall not want.

1292
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:51,660
What did you say?

1293
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:52,828
I make it.

1294
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,741
I said the Lord
is your shepherd.

1295
01:03:54,765 --> 01:03:57,465
No.
I don't need no shepherd.

1296
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,534
I ain't no fucking sheep.

1297
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,069
You hear me?

1298
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:01,937
OK.

1299
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,171
OK, baby.

1300
01:04:03,207 --> 01:04:04,651
So maybe you don't
need no shepherd.

1301
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:07,843
But I bet you sure could
use a little pussy.

1302
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:08,777
No.

1303
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:09,644
Stop this.

1304
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,779
Will you stop this?

1305
01:04:10,814 --> 01:04:12,014
You're supposed to be strong.

1306
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,082
[slap] You've got to be strong.

1307
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:17,853
Don't you ever fucking lay a
hand on me, you piece of shit.

1308
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:19,532
I'm stronger than
you'll ever be.

1309
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,223
OK?
- OK.

1310
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,424
Ever.

1311
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,459
You're the one
who's weak, riding

1312
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:27,462
around in your big man's car.

1313
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,732
[inaudible] car from the inside,
hoping for little handouts.

1314
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,301
Why did you have
to go and get high?

1315
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,712
Why?

1316
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,013
Yeah.

1317
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:52,120
Ask your friend Vic,
Sal, your friends.

1318
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:54,089
OK?

1319
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,858
That's the ones who
fucking shoved it in me.

1320
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,700
Do me a favor, huh?

1321
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,669
Stay out of my fucking life.

1322
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:12,100
Hey.

1323
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,768
What are you doing?

1324
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:16,004
What the fuck are you doing?

1325
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,973
Here.

1326
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,075
It's all washed.

1327
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,478
I took it out for a little spin.

1328
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,593
I hope you don't mind.

1329
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,499
Come on, Frankie.

1330
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:45,712
What the fuck are you doing?

1331
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:48,370
Take me home.

1332
01:06:48,405 --> 01:06:50,739
Frankie.

1333
01:06:50,774 --> 01:06:53,641
Come on.

1334
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:55,910
Sit over here.

1335
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:57,826
Nobody can hear
us talk out here.

1336
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:05,153
Talk about what?

1337
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,287
Our movie.

1338
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:07,789
Our movie?

1339
01:07:07,824 --> 01:07:09,335
Frankie, I ain't making
a fucking movie with you.

1340
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,225
Do you understand me?

1341
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,292
I am not.

1342
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:13,194
Now you gave me your word.

1343
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,697
I gave you my word when I
had two fucking eyes, before I

1344
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:18,733
looked like a fucking mummy.

1345
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:21,302
Well, at least, you know,
listen to my idea, OK?

1346
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,338
Forget it.

1347
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,173
Now would you please listen?

1348
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,709
Hey, it's great.

1349
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:28,744
Sit down.

1350
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:32,748
Fuck.

1351
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,663
I'm going to kill Sal.

1352
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:49,998
I do not want to hear this.

1353
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:50,999
I do not want to hear...

1354
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:52,167
Jesus Christ.

1355
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:53,546
What the fuck are
you doing, Fly?

1356
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,402
Could you please listen to me?
Be careful.

1357
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:55,303
Get the fuck off of me.

1358
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:57,172
Listen to me, please.

1359
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:58,973
OK?

1360
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:03,044
I'm a fucking fake,
pretending, all right?

1361
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:06,347
I never really could
do it, you know?

1362
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:09,717
What you gotta do when you...

1363
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,564
Well, when you take
somebody out, make a hit,

1364
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14,522
it never seemed right to me.

1365
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,291
But it seems right now.

1366
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,693
And I'm going to
kill that cocksucker.

1367
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:20,662
And I'm going to do it on film.

1368
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:23,098
I want the whole world
to see what a punk he is.

1369
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:24,032
All right.

1370
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:26,201
Bang.

1371
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:29,504
And I'm going to do it.

1372
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,873
You've lost your
fucking mind, Frankie.

1373
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:33,174
I don't think so.

1374
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,121
Hey, but you could
be right, you know?

1375
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:39,214
There is a fine line
between insanity and genius.

1376
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:40,548
Take it from me...

1377
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:42,250
You crossed it.

1378
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,285
We got to do it, Joey.

1379
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:45,153
You got to do it.

1380
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:46,121
We got a deal.

1381
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:48,590
Fuck you, we got a deal.

1382
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,727
The deal was you make the
bets, we make a movie.

1383
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:55,263
Frankie, you never
made the bets.

1384
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,065
Oh, yes, I did.

1385
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,400
You said you got a flat.

1386
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,336
I did.

1387
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,271
And I wasn't going to go.

1388
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:07,408
And then, you know, I
thought sometimes God wants

1389
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,245
you to overcome adversity.

1390
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,013
And so I changed that tire.

1391
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:13,448
And I got there.

1392
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,250
And I made that bet.

1393
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:16,584
And it was beautiful.

1394
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:20,755
Why the fuck didn't
you tell me or Sal?

1395
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,756
It wouldn't have mattered.

1396
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,724
It wouldn't have mattered?

1397
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,759
They took my fucking eye.

1398
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,262
Yeah, chances are he
would have taken it anyway.

1399
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:28,163
You are the most...

1400
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,664
Oh, no, no.

1401
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,743
Now you're to hurt yourself.

1402
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:31,878
You're going to hurt yourself.

1403
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:32,945
What the fuck do you think this

1404
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,769
is, a minor corneal abrasion?

1405
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:38,339
Hey, you want your
goddamn money or not?

1406
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:39,274
Yeah.

1407
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,653
- Help me up.
- OK.

1408
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:41,787
We're good.
Good.

1409
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:42,644
Good.
Good.

1410
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:43,311
Yeah.
Come on now.

1411
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,512
Come on now.

1412
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:46,681
Now you just take it easy now.

1413
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,049
OK?

1414
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:50,985
There, huh?

1415
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,555
So I'm going to need
a little more advice,

1416
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:57,025
you know, on like, on how
to use camera and sound

1417
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,227
and shit like that.

1418
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,997
And then maybe you could, like,
well, I mean we just go on

1419
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,567
and do it like we were
before your little mishap.

1420
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:08,369
Now don't you start
on me, all right?

1421
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:10,082
I mean, this is a
hell of a way to treat

1422
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,873
a guy that did you a favor.

1423
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:12,807
A favor?

1424
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,976
Yes, a favor.

1425
01:10:15,011 --> 01:10:16,722
If I had given
Sal all the money,

1426
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,457
you wouldn't have
shit right now.

1427
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,882
You'd be standing on the corner
of Alvarado and 6th selling

1428
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:24,085
pencils, staring at people
out of that goofy fucking eye

1429
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,521
of yours, begging for change.

1430
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,290
So shut the fuck up.

1431
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:31,025
You're rich.

1432
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,229
I kill Sal, it's like putting
the money right in your pocket.

1433
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:37,498
How much money have
you got left, Frankie?

1434
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:38,566
I got all of it.

1435
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:46,241
$143,000... is that enough?

1436
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:47,809
I thought it would be.

1437
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:52,247
[laughs] Hey, it's
a beautiful day.

1438
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:53,748
It's like shit.

1439
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:56,023
Yeah, well, I mean, this
will burn off, you know?

1440
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,754
[car starting]

1441
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,758
[tires squealing]

1442
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:37,970
So you didn't see nothing, huh?

1443
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,862
Not a fucking thing.

1444
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,531
You know, find this note...

1445
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:47,802
Says got your car, Guinea fuck.

1446
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:51,205
You got any balls,
come and get it.

1447
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:56,978
And you know, sitting on
the front seat of my car.

1448
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,180
Guinea fuck.

1449
01:11:59,215 --> 01:12:02,150
Yeah, mano, mano, motherfucker.

1450
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:03,185
Hm.

1451
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,757
Sounds like a setup to me, Fly.

1452
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:11,926
I don't think so.

1453
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:16,331
I'm thinking that this is
some macho thing, you know?

1454
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:21,135
Like... like he says, mano, mano.

1455
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:24,472
What do you think, Vic?

1456
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:29,210
Jeez, it's hard to figure.

1457
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:30,778
It's a good opportunity.

1458
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,825
For what? to get my
fucking brains blown out?

1459
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,781
No.
No.

1460
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:34,449
No.
No.

1461
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:36,984
Hear me out.

1462
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,986
I think I got a good plan.

1463
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,455
You think?

1464
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,090
Yeah.

1465
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,393
We'll let him think you're
coming alone, like he wants.

1466
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,962
And then you won't.

1467
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:49,464
Because I'll be with you.

1468
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:50,698
You?

1469
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:53,167
Hey, what kind of
bullshit is this?

1470
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:54,535
I mean, come on, huh?

1471
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,938
Let him... let him talk.

1472
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,340
There's one thing
that's bothering me.

1473
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:02,210
Why do you want
to do this so bad?

1474
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:05,780
Well, I got two reasons.

1475
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,549
One is I want to film it.

1476
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:09,450
[laughing]

1477
01:13:09,486 --> 01:13:10,486
You want to what?

1478
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,556
I know it sounds crazy,
but think about it.

1479
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:17,725
It could be really cool.

1480
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,861
And what good exposure, huh?

1481
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,795
To who?

1482
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,729
The fucking FBI?

1483
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:22,775
No.
No.

1484
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:23,464
No.
No.

1485
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,866
No.
No.

1486
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,712
No... to these kids that
don't know who you are,

1487
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,803
show these punks, huh?

1488
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:32,240
Set an example of how
not to fuck with you.

1489
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:33,841
This is fucking stupid, huh?

1490
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:34,809
What the fuck?

1491
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:35,921
Let him... let him say it.

1492
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:36,844
Let him go on.

1493
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,880
Yeah.

1494
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,414
Mind your own fucking business.

1495
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,727
Hey, don't tell me to mind
my fucking business, OK?

1496
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,828
I don't fucking like that.

1497
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:43,684
OK.

1498
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,153
Well, fuck you, man.

1499
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:46,053
Fuck everybody.

1500
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,089
I'll go myself.

1501
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,489
I'll get the car back.

1502
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,390
OK?

1503
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,558
I'll do it.

1504
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,927
Yeah, soon as he
calls up at 10:00,

1505
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:54,573
I'll make him
believe that I'm you.

1506
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:55,496
You?

1507
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:57,398
Yeah, me, huh?

1508
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,500
Maybe it's about time
I make a hit, huh?

1509
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:03,905
Yeah, maybe it's about
time that the word spreads.

1510
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,442
You don't fuck with
Frankie the Fly.

1511
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:09,437
Sit the fuck down,
Frankie the Fly.

1512
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,317
Maybe he's right.

1513
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:19,120
Maybe we can really
show them, you know?

1514
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:24,525
Let's show them what
big balls we got.

1515
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:29,096
Why don't you run along now in
case you need to get, you know,

1516
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:29,964
contacted.

1517
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,966
Mhm.

1518
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,601
Yeah, sure.

1519
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:34,636
I'll do that.

1520
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:35,671
All right.

1521
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,008
I think I better
take these, huh?

1522
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,983
[laughs]

1523
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:53,588
Oh, man.

1524
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:56,057
He's a lot of fun.

1525
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:59,627
You think this
could be dangerous?

1526
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,330
The day I've got to
worry about Frankie the Fly

1527
01:15:02,365 --> 01:15:06,667
is the day that
I should be dead.

1528
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:12,039
[MUSIC - BO DIDDLEY, "I'M A
MAN"] You pretty women,

1529
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,976
stand in line.

1530
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,945
I'll make love to
you, baby, one a time.

1531
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:20,448
I'm a man.

1532
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:27,688
And I spell it M-A-N.
Ain't that a man?

1533
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:28,724
All right.

1534
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,368
Love that song.

1535
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:45,139
It's so inspirational...
Makes me feel so alive.

1536
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:48,844
This is it.

1537
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:54,949
Is that a guess?

1538
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:58,920
No, I mean, it looks like
the place he described.

1539
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:06,327
Well, what now,
Mr. Camera Man?

1540
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:08,663
Well, I...

1541
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,899
I guess I'll go and look.

1542
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:18,472
And I'll see if
your car is there.

1543
01:16:18,508 --> 01:16:20,875
[dog barking]

1544
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:26,847
What's all that about?

1545
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:28,549
What are you doing?

1546
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,585
I'm going to wear
it like a disguise.

1547
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:36,691
I thought you wanted
everybody to recognize you.

1548
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:37,858
I do.

1549
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,927
But I figure, you
know, I'm going,

1550
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:42,496
like, make believe
I'm a homeless guy

1551
01:16:42,532 --> 01:16:45,366
till I check it out.

1552
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:48,736
[car door closing]

1553
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:53,574
You thought of
everything, didn't you, Fly?

1554
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:59,146
Now You'll come
if I yell, right?

1555
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:00,047
Oh, yeah.

1556
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:00,948
Yeah.

1557
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:02,383
But I'm going to...

1558
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,818
I'm gong to take this with me.

1559
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:12,627
You think maybe, uh,
maybe I could have that?

1560
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:15,763
No, I think not.

1561
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,766
You don't need a gun, Fly.

1562
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,903
Cause you got big balls.

1563
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:32,314
Hey, Fly.

1564
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:35,717
Give me the gun?

1565
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:43,324
I think that we're
going to need this.

1566
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,030
Right.

1567
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:57,805
[laughs quietly]

1568
01:18:18,895 --> 01:18:23,964
Sal dies... take one.

1569
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Take two.

1570
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,549
Yo, Sal.

1571
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,250
Hey, Sal, Sal, Sal!

1572
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,862
Look, here it is.

1573
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:00,179
Here it is.
Ha.

1574
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:01,035
Ha.

1575
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,070
Look.

1576
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:07,875
Wow.

1577
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,977
Yeah.

1578
01:19:10,012 --> 01:19:11,012
What a surprise.

1579
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,384
So where's the dirt bag?

1580
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:18,519
I don't know.

1581
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,420
Uh.

1582
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:22,156
But I'll get him.

1583
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:25,059
Hey, motherfucker, come
on out here, just like you

1584
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,194
said... mano, mano, huh?

1585
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,763
Come on, you cocksucker.

1586
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,030
Come on.

1587
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,176
You want to mano, mano?
Come on, man.

1588
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,099
Come on.

1589
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:33,734
We're here... hand to hand.

1590
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,668
Come on, brother.

1591
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:35,669
Come on.

1592
01:19:35,705 --> 01:19:37,104
Come on, you piece of shit.

1593
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,917
Let's see your face.
Come on out here.

1594
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:39,807
Come on out here.

1595
01:19:39,842 --> 01:19:40,741
Come on, you prick.

1596
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:41,609
Fly.

1597
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,544
What?

1598
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,379
Shut the fuck up.

1599
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:46,781
What?

1600
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,048
There's nobody here, man.

1601
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:51,252
And you know it.

1602
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,321
You took my car.

1603
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:55,589
What are you talking?

1604
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,626
It was you, Fly.

1605
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:01,796
Vic saw you do it.

1606
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:02,831
And he told me.

1607
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,979
Now why don't you
tell me what it is

1608
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:10,137
you got me down here for, OK?

1609
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:11,750
Because you've
become a problem now.

1610
01:20:11,774 --> 01:20:14,809
And it's not fun anymore.

1611
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:16,488
I haven't got all night,
so let's get to it.

1612
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:17,378
OK?

1613
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:20,414
What do you want?

1614
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:27,988
How come you never
call me Frankie?

1615
01:20:28,024 --> 01:20:30,291
What was that?

1616
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:37,464
How come you never once
call me by my real name?

1617
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,667
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1618
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:40,868
I'm talking about respect.

1619
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:47,274
I'm talking about being
treated like a piece of shit

1620
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,910
all the time.

1621
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:57,418
I'm talking about being
crumbs like a fucking pigeon.

1622
01:20:57,453 --> 01:21:00,487
I'm... I'm more than that.

1623
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,190
I'm more than that.

1624
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,860
Is there anything else you
want to say before you die?

1625
01:21:05,895 --> 01:21:07,628
Yeah.

1626
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,396
Yeah.

1627
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:14,001
There was no reason how
you treated Margaret.

1628
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:17,705
Now there was no reason
for that, no reason at all.

1629
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:25,379
Well, you know, she's a
piece of shit, just like you.

1630
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:26,714
No, uh-uh.

You're the piece of shit.

Yeah, you're a big man
with a gun, aren't you, huh?

You know, this camera

1635
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:39,860
Maybe you got something.

1636

Like you said, you
know, set an example.

1637
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:44,365
Well, why don't you come
and get me, motherfucker?

1638
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,835
Why don't you come and do it
like a man, take me like a man?

1639
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,103
Come on, you prick.

1640

Come on, just one
shot, motherfucker.

1641

Why don't you just come
here and take me like a man?

1642
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,744
I just want to get one fucking
shot at you, you motherfucker.

You going to shoot me?

[MUSIC - CHUCK BERRY, "RIDING
ALONG IN MY AUTOMOBILE"]

1680
01:25:15,411 --> 01:25:23,083
Riding along in my automobile,
my baby beside me at the wheel.

1681
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:27,321
I stole a kiss at the turn
of a mile, my curiosity

1682
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:33,727
running wild, cruising
and playing the radio

1683
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:35,829
with no particular place to go.

1684
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,568
Yeah, did you get that?

1685
01:25:41,604 --> 01:25:43,904
Yeah, Frankie, I got all of it.

1686
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:45,884
FRANKIE: I think we
ought to do it again.

1687
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:48,475
That fucking guy, you
know, he cut me off.

1688
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:49,776
And he screwed up the shot.

1689
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:50,812
Frankie, trust me.

1690
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,513
It's good enough.

1691
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:54,659
FRANKIE: I mean, there's nothing
cooler than an overhead shot

1692
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,250
if it looks right.

1693
01:25:56,285 --> 01:25:59,419
Now you want your money, huh?

1694
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:01,421
Shoot the movie, capisce?

1695
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,824
Now I'm going to around
the block again, all right?

1696
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:05,337
I'm going to pull up
in front of this place.

I prepared a little
something in case

1719
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:29,463
I don't see you
personally for a while.

1720
01:29:29,498 --> 01:29:34,267
I'm not from New
York, like I told you.

1721
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:37,938
Uh, I'm from Michigan.

1722
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:42,142
I... I just, I talk
like this because it's

1723
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:43,710
the way tough guys talk.

1724
01:29:43,746 --> 01:29:47,681
And... and if I... and I figured...

1725
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:51,485
Ah, it doesn't matter.

1726
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,822
Anyway, I just want to tell
you that I really care for you.

1727
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:04,664
Well, if anything goes wrong
with this plan that I got,

1728
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,400
this money is yours.

1729
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:11,705
And I want you to have
it, To maybe get yourself

1730
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,674
a fresh start, you know?

1731
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,777
Be the actress
that you are, huh?

1732
01:30:19,882 --> 01:30:22,382
[laughs]

1733
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:23,583
OK.

1734
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:24,796
So maybe I'll never
be an actress.

1735
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,521
But you are, huh?

1736
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:31,224
And I hear that New York's
a nice place, friendly.

1737
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,692
Actresses go there.

1738
01:30:32,728 --> 01:30:34,694
That's the place actresses go.

1739
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:38,732
So, well, um, I guess that's it.

1740
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:41,234

liked the bastard.

from now, not Sal's.
