2
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,494
Do you know what you've done?

3
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,475
That was a living thing, and you killed it!

4
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,926
And for what? For luck?

5
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:06,275
What if that bug was a provider?

6
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:09,276
What if it had a family?

7
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:18,821
Go on .. go on..

8
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,297
Hold up!!

9
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:23,732
Hold up!!

10
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,173
Just wait a minute.

11
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,929
I literally pulled up here 30 seconds ago.

12
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,534
Seriously.

13
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:30,672
Cop: That's it sir

14
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:32,734
Wallace: So your content with that?

15
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,083
Cop: I'm just doing my job.

16
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:35,235
Wallace: You could have stopped.

17
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:36,336
Cop: No, I couldn't.

18
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:37,777
Wallace: Yes, you could.

19
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:38,938
Man: I know you.

20
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,239
Cop: You should have thought of that
before hand.

21
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,740
Wallace: I have the money!

22
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,641
Cop: Doesn't matter. I'm sorry.

23
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:44,944
Wallce: I have an 1h and 25 min.

24
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,606
Cop: I can't take the money, sir.

25
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,567
Wallace: Here's for an 1h 25min.

26
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,940
Cop: I don't take money sir.

27
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:51,565
Wallace: You can just put them
in the meter, I mean...

28
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,156
Cop: No, I will not
put them in the meter.

29
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,830
Wallace: Well, so is that it? I mean...

30
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,452
Wallace: You couldn't just stop?

31
00:03:57,549 --> 00:03:58,573
Cop: No I couldn't stop.

32
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,939
Cop: According to the municipal code.

33
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,761
Cop: I cannot stop writing a ticket once
I started writing it.

34
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,415
Wallace: So that's it, that's it?

35
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,102
Cop: Have a better day, okay?

36
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:07,332
You don't have to be like this, you know?

37
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,170
You don't have to be this way!

38
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,840
I was trying to teach
that boy something!

39
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,470
Damn .. you .. to hell!

40
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:22,438
Damn you to hell!

41
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,162
Sung.

42
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:52,163
Sung, come in here!

43
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:53,664
What is it?

44
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,000
The drain it's clogged.

45
00:04:58,724 --> 00:04:59,867
Yes it is.

46
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,063
Well stick your hand
down there and unclog it.

47
00:05:03,557 --> 00:05:04,664
Why don't you do it?

48
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,723
The goop, in my hands.

49
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:16,862
We're gonna need some draino.

50
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:18,847
Well buy some.

51
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:22,277
Good afternoon.

52
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,925
Hey, Dwight can I borrow 5 bucks from you?

53
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,842
A friend will soon bring you a gift.

54
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,252
Great.

55
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,174
You are destined for greatness.

56
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,089
That's a pretty good one.

57
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,911
How about ..

58
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:56,775
You have a penchant for humor.

59
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:00,200
Technically, that's more of an observation
than a prediction.

60
00:06:02,701 --> 00:06:03,800
We all finished here?

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,960
Actually, I think I want some more
coffee.

62
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,837
Half cup.

63
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,120
Of course.

64
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:18,245
I'll just leave it here.

65
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:21,002
Don't you rush now.

66
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,875
Oh crap.

67
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,426
You have any money?

68
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:35,504
Oh, damn.

69
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,106
I don't have enough for the right tip.

70
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:38,408
Let's go to the ATM

71
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,475
No no, no just leave what you have.

72
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:42,301
The service wasn't that hot anyway.

73
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,191
$4.13 please.

74
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,215
Can I just get one of these?

75
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,951
Sorry can't break up the pack.

76
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,180
Yeah but you're out of singles.

77
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,759
My hands are tied, hands are tied.

78
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:12,042
C'mon .. you're the only place open.

79
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:14,659
Yeah we are.

80
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:33,105
<i>Baby crying and screaming.</i>

81
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,739
Jesus Christ.

82
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,108
I'm so glad we're not having kids.

83
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,251
What do you mean?

84
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,096
I'm not saying you'd make a bad father
sweetie

85
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:49,860
I understand that.

86
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,916
We're not having kids?

87
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,109
We've discussed this.

88
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:58,077
Turn out the light.

89
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,790
When did we discuss this?

90
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,018
It was at the Science Museum.

91
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,806
There was a family with two kids crying ..

92
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,294
and the parents were all upset.

93
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,598
I turned to you and said: I am so glad

94
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,918
that's not us, and you said: Yeah!

95
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,289
And from that ..

96
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,080
You said you like kids.

97
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,360
No I didn't!

98
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,368
When did I say that?

99
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:31,281
You ...

100
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:32,849
It was...

101
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,426
Wll I don't know, you said it.

102
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:36,846
When?

103
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,314
I don't know!!

104
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,794
You don't know because I never said it.

105
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:43,323
Well I'm not making this up.

106
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,381
You've known my attitude
about it since day 1.

107
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:50,092
So don't go giving me that surprised look.

108
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,349
Now, turn out the light.

109
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,574
You did say it.

110
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,070
Oh my God, stop it.

111
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:13,019
Maybe we should rethink things.

112
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,860
Yeah, maybe we should.

113
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:19,204
Typing: Your girlfriend is lying to you

114
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:29,206
<i>Your girlfriend is lying to you.</i>

115
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:31,713
Hey .. we can't use these.

116
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,649
Sure we can.

117
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,682
Dwight.

118
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,826
This is irresponsible.

119
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:39,067
C'mon .. who's gonna care?

120
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:42,335
Typing: Your relationship is a farce.

121
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,187
Maybe you should go home
for the day.

122
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:48,639
Who are we to prescribe fate anyway?

123
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:53,417
Your trip to heaven or hell was
predetermined long before you were born.

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,980
Huh.

125
00:09:57,156 --> 00:09:58,753
That'd make you a Calvinist.

126
00:09:59,045 --> 00:09:59,729
Yep.

127
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:02,184
I'm a Bahai myself.

128
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,245
Stop making names up from chicken shit.

129
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,957
Fuck you, I'm tolerant.

130
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:07,697
You're indecisive.

131
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,790
Oh yeah?

132
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,191
Well I'm your shift manager
so you can shut your trap.

133
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:14,778
Now get back to work and stick to
the approved messages.

134
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,086
Typing: Norman is an ass.

135
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,819
You will meet the girl of your dreams.

136
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,722
Shit, shit, shit.

137
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:50,672
What is it with me?

138
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,262
Are you alright?

139
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,664
Oh, I'm fine I'm fine.

140
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,175
Here, let me help you.

141
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:56,857
No, I...

142
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:57,715
Don't worry about it, I've got it.

143
00:10:57,821 --> 00:10:58,781
Here's your oranges.

144
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:01,254
Back off, okay?

145
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,260
Thank you.

146
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,096
My name is Mitchell.

147
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:07,384
That's wonderful.

148
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:08,747
Yeah ..

149
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:09,931
I like it.

150
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,401
So what's your name?

151
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:12,939
Please go away.

152
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,170
Woah that's a weird name.

153
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,094
Look, Mitchell?

154
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:18,228
I'd really like you to leave me alone now.

155
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:21,084
We didn't just share a moment.

156
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,402
I just tripped.

157
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,362
Okay?

158
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,689
Yeah, but... the fortune cookie ..

159
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,690
Why don't you have dinner with me.

160
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,091
Nope!

161
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,943
I really think we hit it off.

162
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,393
No, now go away.

163
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:35,259
Look, why not let me give you my
number and then think it over?

164
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,219
Right, all right.

165
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,499
Give me your number, then.

166
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,099
Will that get you away from me?

167
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,395
Yes, it will.

168
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:46,593
My home number is on there too.

169
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:47,583
Just flip it over.

170
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:49,074
Good .. thanks .. wonderful.

171
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,267
Well look, here it goes into the
bottom of my purse.

172
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,367
Never to be seen again.

173
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,026
I really think you're gonna call me.

174
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,087
Bye!

175
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:08,890
Hey!

176
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,250
Wait!

177
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:14,019
Damn it.

178
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:17,044
Hey .. get away!

179
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,712
Get out. Go away!

180
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:27,917
Ow!

181
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,325
Hey man, get back here!

182
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,549
Nice lid, asshole!

183
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:48,463
Thanks a lot, olive.

184
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,381
Is something the matter?

185
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,159
Yes, you're out to ruin me!

186
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,046
I'm not out to ruin you, Ernie.

187
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,330
Then why this hat?

188
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:57,790
I like it!

189
00:12:59,093 --> 00:12:59,831
Why?

190
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,719
Why this hat?

191
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,271
Why the stripey shirts?

192
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:05,441
Why the funny dinners?

193
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,910
I make you these things because
I think that you'll like them ..

194
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,409
I do it because I love you.

195
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:14,235
I don't buy it!

196
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,680
You don't ?!

197
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:18,418
Nope. I think you're trying to embarrass me.

198
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,447
You're being ridiculous.

199
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,254
Am I ? .. am I ??

200
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:25,237
Because I can't seem to think of any
other reason why ..

201
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,158
we can never have a
normal day in this house.

202
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:32,049
Unless maybe you inherited some weirdo gene.

203
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,789
Like your loopy brother.

204
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:53,599
Oh, hello Ernie.

205
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,612
Cyr, how are you?

206
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,671
Ah, nothing to complain about.

207
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,006
You?

208
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:00,806
Been better.

209
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,124
Been better.

210
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,501
I called in an order of Kung Pao chicken.

211
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,956
Oh, one Kung Pao chicken.

212
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,018
To go.

213
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:07,926
Sung.

214
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,182
My new manager.

215
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:09,921
This is Ernie.

216
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,000
He's a very good customer.

217
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:11,956
Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,266
Likewise.

219
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:14,872
Keep the change.

220
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:15,644
Thank you.

221
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:18,258
Have a nice night.

222
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:19,036
You too.

223
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:22,455
Don't touch that man.

224
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,500
His brother had the cancer.

225
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,508
Hello.

226
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:37,593
Oh, hi.

227
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:38,364
Hi.

228
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,614
Yes, I'd like an order of Kung Pao
chicken please.

229
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,404
No more chicken!

230
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:44,864
There seems to be no more chicken.

231
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:46,521
How about some Mushu pork?

232
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,187
Or a cruller?

233
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:52,145
Hmm, I really had my heart
set on that chicken.

234
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,405
Sorry.

235
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,978
Psst .. shoo .. go away.

236
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,603
<i>Sound of cat yowling and being hit by a car.</i>

237
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,031
Why?

238
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,154
Why?

239
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,835
I was trying to help this cat.

240
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,664
Oh man.

241
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:02,867
You can't help this cat.

242
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:03,649
It's dead.

243
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:06,559
See?

244
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:09,359
Yeah.

245
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,597
Thanks.

246
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,188
Oh, no tags.

247
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:25,800
Must be a stray.

248
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,677
Did you find kitty?

249
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,574
Sorry.

250
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,941
Will you keep looking.

251
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,785
Honey, I have to work tomorrow.

252
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:42,266
Please?

253
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:45,951
Okay.

254
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,225
Thank you Clark.

255
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:55,220
Step it up girls.

256
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,185
Consolidated cable.

257
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,291
Yeah, uh, my cable just went out.

258
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,137
Ok, we're experiencing problems..

259
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,322
So if I can have your last name..

260
00:18:22,422 --> 00:18:23,392
so I can bring up your account.

261
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,389
Yes, it's Simmons.

262
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:25,290
Simmons.

263
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:27,978
Ok, Gwenn?

264
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:28,614
Yes.

265
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,613
Ok, what I'll do is..

266
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,712
I'm gonna credit your account for the lost time.

267
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:33,839
I just want to know when it's gonna
get fixed.

268
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,773
My show starts in half an hour.

269
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,251
Yeah, it's hard to say, really..

270
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:40,549
Alright well I really don't want to miss it.

271
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,017
You know, your voice sounds very familiar.

272
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,069
I've had a lot of cable problems.

273
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:47,618
Wait!

274
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:48,563
Say that again!

275
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:50,893
I've had a lot of cable problems?

276
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,076
Ok, now say..

277
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,268
Never to be seen again.

278
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,216
What are you talking about?

279
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:56,951
It's you!

280
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:58,338
You dropped your groceries.

281
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,688
I bought the flowers for you.

282
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,957
My god.

283
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,208
This is incredible.

284
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:02,955
I knew this was..

285
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:03,456
Hold on.

286
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:04,772
Just hold on!

287
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:05,850
Look, I'm not one to be rash..

288
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,670
But I really think we should get together.

289
00:19:07,954 --> 00:19:09,456
I mean, this has got to be fate or something.

290
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,199
It's nothing.

291
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:13,809
My cable went out. You work at the
cable company.

292
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,296
It's really nothing that magical.

293
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,669
The gods have played no part in this.

294
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:18,875
But... the cookie ..

295
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:20,628
and then you called.

296
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:21,991
Cookie?

297
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,503
What cookie? I mean...

298
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,898
who are you?

299
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,010
I'm Mitchell!

300
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:28,217
Ok, Mitchell?

301
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,757
I'm just not interested.

302
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:30,401
Ok?

303
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:31,808
So just credit my account..

304
00:19:31,902 --> 00:19:32,840
or whatever you're gonna do ..

305
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:34,150
and have a nice day.

306
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:35,627
Alright?!

307
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,292
Oh, ok.

308
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:47,015
Hello.

309
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,992
<i>Singing on phone: You are the sun,
you are the rain</i>

310
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:53,724
<i>that makes my life this foolish game</i>

311
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:57,682
<i>You need to know, I love you so</i>

312
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,470
<i>and I'd do it all again and again</i>

313
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:05,963
Mother Fuckers!

314
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,730
C'mon, let's get you to school.

315
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,303
No who remembers that "elephant" ..

316
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:16,447
is spelled with "ph" instead of "f"?

317
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:19,441
Well that is strange..

318
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,009
because everyone forgot..

319
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,595
to spell it like that on this weeks
spelling test.

320
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:27,457
Everybody ... except for ... Jennie.

321
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,744
Jennie gets this weeks gold star.

322
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:31,480
Mother fucker!

323
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:51,607
Kids!

324
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:05,615
You were blessed with a keen intellect ...

325
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:08,544
and one hell of a man.

326
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:16,978
You are leaving ?

327
00:21:18,098 --> 00:21:19,033
I finished rethinking.

328
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:21,966
So let's discuss this.

329
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,857
I really don't want kids, Dwight.

330
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:26,369
How can you be sure?

331
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:31,218
I just ... I see this flustered look in
every mom and dad ...

332
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:34,138
this harried, exhausted look.

333
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,656
and I, I don't want to be that person.

334
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:37,804
You know?

335
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:38,554
And...

336
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:41,686
Today was the last straw.

337
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,753
What, you get mugged by a baby?

338
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,247
You're an asshole.

339
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,278
Jesus.

340
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,067
I just think you're oversimplifying
the issue.

341
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,484
I don't think you can categorically say ...

342
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:51,525
No, no, no, I can.

343
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,275
You just won't accept it.

344
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,811
So I don't think there is any
point in dragging this out.

345
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:01,804
I think I should leave.

346
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:05,672
Fine.

347
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:07,932
If that's what you want.

348
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:17,176
But I have to say this doesn't bode
well for you.

349
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:21,106
Meaning what?

350
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,335
Well ...

351
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,104
let's say by Calvinists standards ...

352
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,689
I am predestined to go to heaven.

353
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,104
Your leaving me ...

354
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:30,963
Wouldn't speak to highly of your fate.

355
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:33,402
Oh Dwight, you are ridiculous.

356
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,266
If that's what you need to believe.

357
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,435
Go ahead.

358
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:37,839
Play with fate.

359
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:40,149
What makes you so sure ...

360
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,552
you've been chosen for heaven?

361
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:42,884
I'm not.

362
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,286
No one can be sure.

363
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,023
Ah hah.

364
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:47,498
Unless ...

365
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:49,097
I had my vision of confirmation.

366
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,744
Have you?

367
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,769
No.

368
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,762
Take a look around.

369
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,758
I have a good job.

370
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:59,043
Wealth of material goods.

371
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:00,600
Full head of hair.

372
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,934
Surely that's indicative of something.

373
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:07,516
I'd say I'm due any day now.

374
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,144
How can you be sure that
I'm not chosen?

375
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,466
And that my leaving actually bodes
poorly for you?

376
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,940
Well ...

377
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,809
Obviously ...

378
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:21,909
You can't ...

379
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,049
can you?

380
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:27,997
I'll be back in a few days for my boxes.

381
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:46,682
A buck ... two bucks ...

382
00:23:46,887 --> 00:23:47,387
Two bucks ...

383
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,390
Ah, William DeVaughn.

384
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:53,976
Kinda rare.

385
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:56,412
I'll give you 20 for that ...

386
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:57,249
Great.

387
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,089
Ok, um ... 50 for the whole stack.

388
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:05,836
Deal.

389
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,495
Would a doomed man have a wad
this thick?

390
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:14,739
Excuse me?

391
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:16,764
Never mind.

392
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,911
Um, is that the guy who sings "Be thankful
for what you got" ?

393
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,590
Yeah.

394
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:41,588
Fantastic.

395
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:43,137
Ooh, how much for the William DeVaughn?

396
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:44,638
40.

397
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:45,629
Sold.

398
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,171
Thank you.

399
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,365
You're welcome.

400
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:02,463
I was gonna buy that.

401
00:25:09,529 --> 00:26:35,076
<i>William Devaughn's "Be thankful for what
you've got" playing.</i>

402
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:40,231
Do you mind if I grab one of these?

403
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,689
Knock yourself out.

404
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:05,614
Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions.

405
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:06,917
"Choice of colors".

406
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,654
<i>Southern California's only R&B gold ...</i>

407
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:12,615
<i>it's KRCE.</i>

408
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:16,365
<i>I've got something kind of special
for todays pick to win.</i>

409
00:27:16,956 --> 00:27:21,632
<i>It was a No. 1 hit in 1974,
selling over 4 million copies.</i>

410
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:24,238

411
00:27:24,914 --> 00:27:26,006

414
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,053
<i>Good luck.</i>

415
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:36,078
<i>William Devaughn playing on radio again.</i>

416
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:38,348
William DeVaughn.

417
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:41,584
William DeVaughn!

418
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,024
Ah, Dwight.

419
00:27:57,318 --> 00:27:58,255
Let me get your pork.

420
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,514
Thank you, sir.

421
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,150
$7.95.

422
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:26,239
Keep the change, my friend.

423
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,288
Life's been good.

424
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:28,491
Oh, very well.

425
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,385
Have a nice day.

426
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:30,291
Always.

427
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,073
Hey Cyr, did you finish cooking
the pork?

428
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:45,839
Excuse me, mister taking a break boy?

429
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,295
Did you finish the pork?!

430
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,100
Yes.

431
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,792
Of course.

432
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,188
<i>On phone: Thanks for holding, Dept. of
Health, how can I assist you?</i>

433
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:24,454
What, what is it?

434
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,803
What do we need to do?

435
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:27,793
Well you can start with better
refrigeration ...

436
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,055
this units a little warm.

437
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:30,698
Is that the problem?

438
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:31,345
It's hard to say.

439
00:29:32,933 --> 00:29:34,693
Doesn't take much for a piece of
meat to go bad.

440
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,334
Age .. low cooking heat.

441
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:41,744
Poor refrigeration ... peer pressure.

442
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,116
It can even be vermon infestation.

443
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,258
You've got a few small holes ...

444
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:49,668
under the wash basin.

445
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:50,437
Liar.

446
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:52,716
We haven't seen any rats around here.

447
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:53,759
Well, they're very sneaky creatures.

448
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,502
It's the street crew. They bring in dust
and dirty feces.

449
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,083
Some are gypsys.

450
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,746
With all due respect, Mr. Tremon ...

451
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:02,657
I think the root of your
problem is internal ...

452
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:03,749
rather than external.

453
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,973
I'm clean! My food is clean!

454
00:30:07,073 --> 00:30:07,888
Cyr, calm down.

455
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,875
He insults me.

456
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:09,912
If I may.

457
00:30:14,642 --> 00:30:17,157
This is just a simple reactive solution.

458
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:22,855
These green spots indicate
concentrations of bacteria.

459
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:24,218
Oh my god.

460
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,875
No need to worry. These are probably
harmless paramecium.

461
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:30,213
But if this service had just been
wiped down properly ...

462
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:33,562
there'd be a lot less of them.

463
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:35,717
Are you gonna cite us?

464
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:38,241
No.

465
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,548
Turn down your refrigerator a
few notches ...

466
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:41,809
plug up those holes and ...

467
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,360
pay attention to the safety guidelines
on this sheet.

468
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:45,398
Ok.

469
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:46,455
I'll come back around.

470
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,554
Next week.

471
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,394
If everythings kosher ...

472
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:52,099
we won't need to take any action.

473
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:53,735
We'll get it done.

474
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:54,569
Thanks a lot.

475
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:56,703
See you next week.

476
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:02,326
Did you hear what he said?

477
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:03,054
Yeah.

478
00:31:03,193 --> 00:31:04,250
We have the bacteria.

479
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:06,867
It's ok, I'll just turn down the fridge
and and get the spackle in the morning.

480
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:08,892
No!

481
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,343
Throw out all the food.

482
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:17,598
I want everything clean.

483
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,286
Floor, counters, cabinets, oven.

484
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,920
Use the special cleansers.

485
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:22,956
No man, that will take hours.

486
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:24,420
I told you, I have to leave at six today.

487
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,841
I'll come back in the morning and
take care of it.

488
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:26,801
No, do it today!

489
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,920
I really think you're overreacting.

490
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:29,427
Today!!!

491
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:32,380
Fine.

492
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:43,626
Closed.

493
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:46,639
Sorry.

494
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:55,169
Hey, you like the "Dodgers"?

495
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,430
Here.

496
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,368
Bye honey I'll be back later.

497
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:04,824
Where are you going?

498
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:06,213
Dodger game.

499
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:08,334
Guy at the donut shop gave me a ticket.

500
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:09,386
Well what about dinner?

501
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll get something at the game.

502
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:13,959
But I made you dinner.

503
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:19,257
Why are you trying to keep me from
having fun?

504
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:20,521
I'm not.

505
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:22,686
Then what are you trying to do?

506
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:24,430
Nothing.

507
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:26,920
See you later.

508
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:27,956
Bye.

509
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,852
Alert, alert. Fire on stage, ladies.

510
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,471
Careful, this can get hot and wet.

511
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:51,145
Smooth, hot.

512
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:59,214
Let's see some dollar bills, ladies.

513
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:09,998
Last call.

514
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:39,723
<i>Sound of car hitting something.</i>

515
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:10,404
Shit.

516
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,505
<i>Sound of tiring exploding.</i>

517
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:25,626
Jesus!

518
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:35,681
Great!

519
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,815
Sorry.

520
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:24,572
Sir, your blocking the alley.

521
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:29,157
Oh my god.

522
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,449
Can you just ...

523
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:33,437
Take a minute.

524
00:35:33,454 --> 00:35:34,255
Write the ticket!

525
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,887
Sir, I'm sensitive to the needs of the dog.

526
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:37,766
Write it! Write it!

527
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:42,616
Canus Rabidus.

528
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:45,066
This dog will not live much longer.

529
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,753
It's okay.

530
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:51,898
<i>Sound of dog growling and barking and
biting Mitchell.</i>

531
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,111
Ow, my arm.

532
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,627
Help me! Get off me!

533
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:57,621
Get off me please!

534
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:58,661
Help me.

535
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:00,864
Someone help me.

536
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:04,931
I saw something very curious today.

537
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,625
A man wrestling a sick dog ...

538
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:10,047
into his car.

539
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,327
The dog did not understand that
 the man was trying to help.

540
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,623
And bit and clawed furiously at him.

541
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:20,359
Using his dying breaths, to attack.

542
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:21,956
The man did not give up.

543
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:25,407
He continued his attempts to get the
dog in the car ...

544
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:27,546
all the while yelling for help.

545
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:30,592
First for the dog ...

546
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:32,519
then for himself.

547
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:37,431
Yet no one stopped
to help these two poor creatures.

548
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:38,844
Why?

549
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:41,669
Was it because it was a dog?

550
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:45,960
Because the man was dirty and
wearing coveralls?

551
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,726
Were we too busy? Were we afraid?

552
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:57,543
Or, did we not see it as a problem that
required our involvement?

553
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:01,453
I think it's the latter, my friends.

554
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:06,458
I think that we as a people
have become desensitized.

555
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:12,460
Sad word isn't it?

556
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:16,380
De - sensitized.

557
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:18,534
Without the senses.

558
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,631
Scary.

559
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,925
I'm gonna be reading from a text
this evening.

560
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,633
A tele-flick, to be exact ...

561
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:29,999
and although a lot of people look down
there noses at tv ...

562
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:31,552
myself included ...

563
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:34,345
This particular piece of television ...

564
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:36,935
taught, and can still teach ...

565
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:38,978
all of us a little bit more ...

566
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:42,455
about the value of life.

567
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:44,991
All life.

568
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:48,357
"The boy in the bubble".

569
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,262
Joining me this evening in this reading is ...

570
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,808
esteemed local acting instructor ...

571
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:54,114
Joan Reading.

572
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:55,753
Welcome, Joan.

573
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:56,359
Thank you.

574
00:37:57,364 --> 00:37:58,996
Very European.

575
00:38:00,595 --> 00:38:01,279
Joan ...

576
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:02,541
I was thinking ..

577
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,877
that we would start with page 45.

578
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,206
The first hospital scene.

579
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:09,955
I'll play the role of the doctor ...

580
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:13,311
and Joan will play the role of the
boys mother.

581
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:16,966
Ready?

582
00:38:17,802 --> 00:38:18,750
Yes.

583
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:22,340
I'm afraid that we have to
put your son in a bubble.

584
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,249
But, how will I hug him?

585
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:27,810
Hug him, from here.

586
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,513
I don't understand.

587
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:33,620
Love transcends bubbles.

588
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:35,618
It moves through...

589
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:37,023
plastic.

590
00:38:37,744 --> 00:38:39,060
Past tubes and compressors.

591
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,583
Past gloves and masks.

592
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:42,392
If you hug him ...

593
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:43,586
with your heart.

594
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:45,561
He will feel it.

595
00:38:49,636 --> 00:38:51,142
I can't.

596
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,253
Look at it.

597
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:55,551
That ...

598
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:57,244
bubble.

599
00:38:57,826 --> 00:38:58,797
So big.

600
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:00,044
So cold ...

601
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:02,407
and poor Billy inside it like
a circus freak.

602
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:07,770
I hate that bubble.

603
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:10,874
I hate it.

604
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:11,664
Forget the bubble!

605
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:15,255
Billy could be in a thousand bubbles ...
Billy could be in the center of the earth ...

606
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,528
He still could feel your love.

607
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,720
Forget that Bubble Mrs. Vansel and get
in there and love your son ...

608
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,444
god damn it!

609
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,314
Hello dear.

610
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,998
Can you hear me?

611
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,089
I'll now take on the role of the
bubble child.

612
00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:41,344
Mother?

613
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,156
It's just not fair.

614
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,801
I don't deserve this.

615
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:47,076
I mean quite honestly ...

616
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,844
my whole life has been a nightmare.

617
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,640
And now this.

618
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,762
The final insult ... the coldest cut.

619
00:39:55,408 --> 00:39:56,445
Mother!

620
00:39:57,935 --> 00:40:00,559
My poor freakish child.

621
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:02,848
Would you still love me if
I was in a bubble?

622
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:05,177
Of course I would, sugar.

623
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,586
I was made for you.

624
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:08,212
I'd be in a bubble.

625
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:10,333
I understand that.

626
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,189
You wouldn't be able to come in, you know?

627
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:18,907
The amount of germs in your eyebrow
alone could ravage me.

628
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,835
Your eyebrow could kill me.

629
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:23,535
I would love you from outside the bubble.

630
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:26,193
Would you, though ?

631
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:30,908
You don't trust me?

632
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:33,549
I wouldn't be able to perform
certain duties ...

633
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:34,878
husbandly duties.

634
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:37,040
What are you getting at?

635
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:38,229
I'm in a bubble.

636
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:39,930
I can't come out for the rest of my life ...

637
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,805
or I'll die.

638
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:43,837
You're not gonna get even a little
piece on the side?

639
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,085
Not without your blessing.

640
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,652
But you admit that someone with
a  more active lifestyle ...

641
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,854
might catch your eye.

642
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:50,099
I'm not admitting anything.

643
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,372
Who is it?

644
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:53,908
What, some tennis pro probably.

645
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:55,960
Wayne, the tennis pro.

646
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,845
Wayne?

647
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:58,161
What about if I said ...

648
00:40:58,533 --> 00:41:01,428
sure, go ahead. You wouldn't go for a
little roll with Wayne?

649
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:03,846
Maybe I would.

650
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:07,961
Probably be a regular event.

651
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:09,846
Thursday afternoon or something.

652
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:10,952
I suppose eventually ...

653
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:11,925
he'd be my mistress.

654
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:13,222
But I would still love you.

655
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,370
Great, stop by the bubble everyday or so ...

656
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,751
and the rest of the time you'd
be with Wayne ...

657
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,183
Playing frisbee.

658
00:41:19,283 --> 00:41:20,113
Honey, please.

659
00:41:20,213 --> 00:41:21,162
No no, it's fine!

660
00:41:21,518 --> 00:41:22,639
Thanks for bringing by the magazines.

661
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:23,417
Say hi to Wayne.

662
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:24,610
Have fun at the zoo.

663
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:28,430
Just toss a rope inside the bubble on your
way out so I can hang myself.

664
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,250
Stop!

665
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:33,604
Too close to home?
Too close to the bone?

666
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,050
Maybe you've got a Wayne right now.

667
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,468
What'd you did this afternoon?

668
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:37,900
I cooked you dinner.

669
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,776
After the zoo?

670
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:40,527
Did you want your dinner?

671
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:41,853
No, give it to Wayne.

672
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:43,065
I'm in a bubble.

673
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,924
Fine.

674
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,440
Oh, you're a fine lady, olive.

675
00:41:48,927 --> 00:41:50,976
Were you with Wayne when you
wrecked the car last night?

676
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:52,663
You lose your dinner, it's down the drain.

677
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:54,681
You know what your problem is?

678
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:56,037
You're insensitive!

679
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:57,669
I can't hear you.

680
00:41:58,284 --> 00:41:59,274
Insensitive.

681
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,399
You're an "insensite".

682
00:42:01,658 --> 00:42:03,015
That's not even a word!

683
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,071
"insensite".

684
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:05,830
"insensite".

685
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:29,904
I was blinded.

686
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,110
There was a flash.

687
00:42:31,456 --> 00:42:33,043
Environment is a cruel mistress.

688
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:38,489
Should I get some kind of partial credit?

689
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:39,649
there were 51 packs.

690
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,602
The record is 1200.

691
00:42:42,301 --> 00:42:43,357
You were quite a ways away.

692
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:44,385
Let him try again.

693
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:45,923
You be quiet, Henry!

694
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,225
He'll be eligible for another attempt
in six months.

695
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:50,062
We look forward to your call.

696
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:52,500
Remember, records were made to broken.

697
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,944
- C'mon Ted. Open up, Ted.
- We're your friends, Ted.

698
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,264
Christ, what is the big deal?

699
00:43:08,493 --> 00:43:11,240
- He really wanted it.
- Ok, but he didn't get it.

700
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:12,988
He doesn't have to hole up like this.

701
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:15,059
Ted, c'mon man, open the door.

702
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:17,610
Hey dude, calm down.

703
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:18,443
You know what, I won't!

704
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:20,216
The same thing happened last year
with the eggs ...

705
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:21,917
we all rushed over here like puppies.

706
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,534
So I am sick of it.

707
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:26,430
Ted, Ted, stop being baby, man!

708
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,870
Go away I don't need you.

709
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,850
Alright. You know what, let's go.

710
00:43:28,908 --> 00:43:29,751
No no, hold on a second.

711
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:33,075
I'm sorry guys, he's really upset.

712
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:34,259
Well, can't we see him?

713
00:43:35,064 --> 00:43:36,220
Give him a few days.

714
00:43:36,236 --> 00:43:37,396
Few days?

715
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,835
No we're supposed to watch the fight
here tomorrow.

716
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:40,110
Where is my suit, Henry?

717
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:41,517
I'm sorry.

718
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,391
Henry ...

719
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:45,049
Wonderful.

720
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:46,842
And what are we supposed to do now?

721
00:43:47,683 --> 00:43:48,757
Well, is he the only one with HBO?

722
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:49,394
Yes.

723
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,776
I'm not going to a sports bar.

724
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:52,195
Can we get HBO by tomorrow night?

725
00:43:52,425 --> 00:43:53,507
Right, got it.

726
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:55,156
Where is it?

727
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:00,229
I might be able to help.

728
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:03,601
Hello?

729
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:04,768
Monsieur Mitchell.

730
00:44:05,078 --> 00:44:06,343
How good to see you.

731
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,300
And who is your lovely companion?

732
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:10,741
Ah, this is the Gwenn.

733
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:11,406
My date.

734
00:44:11,506 --> 00:44:12,159
Friend!

735
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,374
Enchante.

736
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:14,488
Oh, thank you.

737
00:44:15,232 --> 00:44:17,998
So Albert, do you think you can get
us in tonight?

738
00:44:18,196 --> 00:44:19,759
For you! Of course!

739
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:21,268
Let's see...

740
00:44:34,043 --> 00:44:34,911
Right this way.

741
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:35,667
Thank you.

742
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:50,355
Good evening.

743
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:50,990
Hi.

744
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:51,747
Johnston ...

745
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:52,258
party of 3.

746
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:53,697
I believe I have a reservation.

747
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,006
I am sorry ...

748
00:44:58,542 --> 00:44:59,719
I don't seem to see anything.

749
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:01,339
Oh it's gotta be there, I called a week ago.

750
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:05,102
I'm afraid I don't see anything. What was
the name again?

751
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:06,229
Johnston.

752
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:08,924
J-o-h-n-s-t-o-n.

753
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:13,011
No, no, I'm sorry, we don't have any
reservation in that name.

754
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,379
I don't understand, I called last week.

755
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,352
You specifically said there wouldn't
be a problem.

756
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,562
I wish there was something I could do.

757
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:28,093
Look, this is a very important
business dinner.

758
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,889
Try to fit us in somewhere. Thank you.

759
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,390
Let's see.

760
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:39,178
It looks like the earliest I could sit you
would be at 10:15.

761
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:41,792
10:15! That's over two hours from now.

762
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:43,894
Perhaps you can have a drink at the bar.

763
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,254
No, I want a table!

764
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,213
I cannot give you one, we are full.

765
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:50,240
Look, I had a reservation, I want a table ...

766
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,475
and I just gave you $ 20!

767
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,435
Mr. Johnston, it seems that we are
at an impasse.

768
00:45:56,524 --> 00:46:01,345
You are an irresistible force, and
I am an immovable object.

769
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:04,651
One of us must relent or we will both
perish.

770
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:07,807
Then relent god damn it, you smug son
of a bitch.

771
00:46:07,907 --> 00:46:08,898
Give me back my money.

772
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:10,736
What seems to be the problem here?

773
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,855
This guy lost our reservation.

774
00:46:12,955 --> 00:46:14,807
Excuse me, but I have already informed...

775
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:18,122
And I informed you that 10:15
is too late!

776
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:20,353
Can I see you for a minute please?

777
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:21,221
Asshole!

778
00:46:21,634 --> 00:46:22,531
Excuse us.

779
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,219
Can you believe him? I swear to god ...

780
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:26,119
I thought you said you double checked this.

781
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:29,676
Well I did ... I didn't think it
was necessary.

782
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,126
Mr. Kim comes to town once a year.

783
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,732
He specifically requests this restaurant, and
you don't think it's necessary to double check it?

784
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:38,707
Look, they specifically told
me that this was not gonna be a ...

785
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:41,287
And then you make a scene in front
of him and the entire restaurant.

786
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,742
Ms. Chambers, you...

787
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,469
Johnston, you're fired.

788
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:49,025
Don't bother coming in tomorrow. We'll
send you your things.

789
00:46:50,271 --> 00:46:52,579
Mr. Kim. I'm so sorry. There seems
to be a little mix up.

790
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,883
I know a little Italian place just a
couple blocks over.

791
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:01,328
What about those municipal bonds?

792
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:05,143
We sold them for Lizzy's braces and
the air conditioner.

793
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:06,264
Right!

794
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:10,788
O God, we're gonna have to get another
car. They're taking away the company car.

795
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:13,123
We'll get a used one, or lease.

796
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,264
What about Jeffries and Jeffries?

797
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:17,820
Didn't they want you for a while?

798
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:18,982
8 months ago.

799
00:47:19,828 --> 00:47:20,988
Couldn't hurt to ask.

800
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,503
This second mortgage will kill us.

801
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,768
Katie really likes the pool.

802
00:47:28,037 --> 00:47:31,132
We're gonna be ok. We'll just cut back
for a month or two.

803
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:32,734
Hopefully only be a month or two.

804
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:33,472
We'll be fine.

805
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,461
Ok, we're obviously gonna have
to cancel the trip to Hawaii.

806
00:47:36,836 --> 00:47:37,965
Sure, I'll call today.

807
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:39,473
Good, what else?

808
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,300
The maid, the gardening service...

809
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:44,689
What about Katie's ballet?

810
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:46,373
The next payment is due on the first.

811
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,965
I really don't want her to miss that.

812
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:52,384
Could she maybe just take a
break for a month?

813
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:57,025
Well, she will not be
happy but she'll understand.

814
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,928
Honey, I just don't want to risk
missing a mortgage payment.

815
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:00,929
It's okay!

816
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:02,807
She'll be fine.

817
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,131
We'll take her to Jojo's tonight.

818
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:07,866
You want me to tell her?

819
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:08,718
No, I'll do it.

820
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:29,252
Here comes Daddy, tell him, tell him.

821
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:32,052
Guess what daddy... guess what!?

822
00:48:32,957 --> 00:48:33,551
What?

823
00:48:33,821 --> 00:48:37,687
Katie Johnston dropped out of class, so
my teacher gave me the lead in the recital.

824
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:40,294
Is that right?

825
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,916
That means I'm the second best in
the whole class.

826
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:44,934
No it doesn't, it means your the
first best...

827
00:48:45,034 --> 00:48:47,114
the teacher just took too long
to realize it.

828
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:48,801
I'll be a swan.

829
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:51,550
I'm so proud of you, honey.

830
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,789
I get to perform in front of the whole
school, all alone.

831
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:56,667
Really?

832
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,807
She has a solo.

833
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:00,407
I cant believe it.

834
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,665
My little girl, up there performing
by her self.

835
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,570
I'm a swan.

836
00:49:07,707 --> 00:49:10,139
The teacher said they might even put
it on public access tv.

837
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:33,164
<i>Sound of bullet whizzing and hitting
pig and the pig squeels.</i>

838
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:41,042
<i>Package is food for pigs.</i>

839
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,402
Sung, you see this?

840
00:49:54,645 --> 00:49:56,549
Death is outside our door.

841
00:49:57,212 --> 00:49:58,032
It was just a pig.

842
00:49:59,074 --> 00:49:59,953
Look what it left.

843
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:06,000
It's just a little blood.

844
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:07,953
Go out there Sung ... go!

845
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:10,590
Hose down the deck.

846
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:20,753
Go away! You're gonna bring it in!

847
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:22,432
We just want some maple bars.

848
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:24,702
Go away, we're closed.

849
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:27,705
Hey, Cyr, you have to stop doing that.

850
00:50:28,146 --> 00:50:28,918
Be quiet!

851
00:50:29,436 --> 00:50:29,936
Cyr!

852
00:50:30,014 --> 00:50:31,569
It's my store, we do what I want!

853
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:41,142
Where are you going?

854
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:41,844
Home.

855
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:42,755
I quit!

856
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:44,162
Good!

857
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:46,843
You're a dirty man

858
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:50,061
I'm better off without you!

859
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:55,745
Pig.

860
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,270
<i>Sound of breaking glass.</i>

861
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:10,109
This is the kind of thinking that
separates us from the apes.

862
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:32,075
<i>Paradise found.</i>

863
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:38,549
Norman.

864
00:52:38,937 --> 00:52:39,685
What is it Dwight?

865
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,602
I am hereby requesting a leave
of absence.

866
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:46,335
You are!?

867
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:47,365
Yes.

868
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:48,414
An extended leave.

869
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,572
In Hawaii.

870
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:52,085
And it starts this Friday.

871
00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:56,193
Fine, yeah, okay.

872
00:52:56,772 --> 00:52:58,935
I'm gonna give you a big fat no
on that request.

873
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,240
Why?

874
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:03,570
Why?

875
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:08,632
Because I don't like you, because you want
it...

876
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,758
because you called me an ass and
a chicken.

877
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:15,084
So you can either get back to work...

878
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,536
or you can scamper off to your islands
and come back unemployed.

879
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:20,976
Well?

880
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:22,762
What's it gonna be?

881
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,694
You will soon lose a valued employee.

882
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:29,686
When?

883
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,046
Right now.

884
00:53:40,078 --> 00:53:40,952
Aloha.

885
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,503
Aloha jag-off!

886
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:48,493
No, no, no.  I don't have a phone yet.
I just moved into a new place.

887
00:53:49,252 --> 00:53:50,739
Does that matter for you guys?

888
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,575
No, sir...

889
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:52,762
that's just for our records.

890
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:53,909
When do you want the Cable installed?

891
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:54,890
What's available?

892
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,072
Aloha!

893
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:00,835
Hello?

894
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:03,213
Hello?

895
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:09,916
Thanks for meeting me.

896
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:11,740
Sure.

897
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:13,590
It sounded so urgent.

898
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:16,634
Well, um, I was just so excited.

899
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:20,369
So uh...

900
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:23,472
Here.

901
00:54:26,608 --> 00:54:27,553
What is this?

902
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:29,238
It's uh...

903
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:30,413
Hawaii...

904
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:32,960
Oh my god.

905
00:54:33,697 --> 00:54:35,139
3 days in Maui, 4 on the Big Island.

906
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:42,826
I don't not know...

907
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:44,900
Mitchell, I don't know what to say.

908
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:47,964
I just thought that the best way for us
to get to know each other better...

909
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:49,238
would be to go away for a while.

910
00:54:51,077 --> 00:54:51,814
I've never...

911
00:54:52,064 --> 00:54:53,024
never been to Hawaii.

912
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:55,222
I've got a cousin there.

913
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:56,817
We'll go see him... her.

914
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,009
Him.. him!

915
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:08,670
I can't do this.

916
00:55:10,146 --> 00:55:11,071
I can't go.

917
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,026
Why not?

918
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:18,822
I used you.

919
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:22,682
I used you to get Cable for my friends.

920
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:25,822
and if I took this ticket, I'd be
using you again.

921
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,027
And I can't.

922
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:32,052
I'm sorry.

923
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:34,180
I'm really, sorry.

924
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:37,640
It just wouldn't be fair for me to go
to Hawaii with you.

925
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:41,738
I don't have the same feelings as
you do.

926
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:03,933
<i>Cookie: Your girlfriend is lying to you.</i>

927
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:11,890
I'm scared too.

928
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:17,154
No, Mitchell, you don't understand.

929
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,358
I completely understand.

930
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:21,420
It's all very sudden I know...

931
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:23,472
but let's now worry about all that.

932
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,972
Let's just go to Hawaii and relax.

933
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:27,177
Mitchell no!

934
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,133
No strings, no obligations.

935
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:34,008
Just leave it to fate.

936
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,065
I do not know, I...

937
00:56:39,047 --> 00:56:41,466
If nothing else, you owe it to your
cousin.

938
00:56:47,124 --> 00:56:48,423
Hawaii.

939
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,315
Well...

940
00:56:52,436 --> 00:56:53,118
C'mon Gwenn...

941
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:55,277
Just say yes.

942
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:04,323
Fine!

943
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,253
Fine.

944
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,429
Great!

945
00:57:11,802 --> 00:57:12,692
Great!

946
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,241
Great!

947
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:16,669
I knew you'd say yes.

948
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:18,969
Oh you did, didn't you.

949
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,777
Should we get out of here?

950
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:28,310
Sure.

951
00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:36,869
Hold up man.

952
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:38,646
Here you go.

953
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:40,046
Thank you.

954
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:30,596
Yes!

955
00:58:49,496 --> 00:58:51,466
<i>Seat 14A.</i>

956
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:56,253
<i>Seat 28D.</i>

957
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:00,432
<i>Seat 28E.</i>

958
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,254
<i>Seat 32D.</i>

959
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,868
<i>Seat 30D... cancelled!</i>

960
00:59:27,507 --> 00:59:29,539
<i>Seat 30D.</i>

961
00:59:54,497 --> 00:59:55,730
I'm willing to create.

962
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,362
I'm willing to learn to let myself create.

963
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:03,747
I'm learning to create.

964
01:00:05,029 --> 01:00:07,286
I'm willing to learn to let myself create.

965
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,792
I'm learning to create.

966
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:13,976
I'm willing...

967
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,017
Oh my god.

968
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:24,869
Oh my god.

969
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:26,344
Oh my God.

970
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:37,299
Wait!

971
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:38,805
Don't!

972
01:00:40,692 --> 01:00:41,334
Don't!

973
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:45,026
<i>Meter expires</i>

974
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,867
Excuse me.

975
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:46,560
Excuse me.

976
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,371
Stop!

977
01:01:26,261 --> 01:01:27,341
Stop!

978
01:01:33,115 --> 01:01:35,361
So much to live for.

979
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,702
A whole life in front...

980
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:42,199
New start...

981
01:01:43,156 --> 01:01:44,570
Silver lining...

982
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,559
ice cream...

983
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:52,154
ball games...

984
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:02,500
Please... don't.

985
01:02:12,498 --> 01:02:14,023
Who are you?

986
01:02:18,216 --> 01:02:20,403
Just one person who wants you to live.

987
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:54,221
No! No!

988
01:03:15,693 --> 01:03:18,505
Vultures! Vultures!

989
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:22,269
I see you, you vulture!

990
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,218
You want my blood?

991
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:35,928
Fine!

992
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,227
In a field of broken glass.

993
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:56,635
Here's...

994
01:03:59,959 --> 01:04:01,190
some... blood!

995
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:06,415
Here's your blood money... Vultures!

996
01:04:57,012 --> 01:04:59,148
Thank you.

997
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:13,243
Nice shirt!

998
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:23,038
Hi honey.

999
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,152
Hello.

1000
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:25,507
Would you like some dinner?

1001
01:05:32,665 --> 01:05:33,793
I'd love some.

1002
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,437
You would?

1003
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:38,762
Sure.

1004
01:05:49,723 --> 01:05:51,646
Mmm, that's good.

1005
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:03,445
I sauteed the spices first.  It brings
out the flavor more.

1006
01:06:07,055 --> 01:06:08,403
I love it.  Thank you honey.

1007
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:19,778
It's really good!

1008
01:06:44,803 --> 01:06:47,803
<i>Sound of love making and the
bed thumping.</i>

1009
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
<i>Health inspector screaming.</i>

1010
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:21,126
Where's the other man?

1011
01:07:21,946 --> 01:07:23,547
He's hurt. I'm the substitute.

1012
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:26,759
You're not a real inspector?

1013
01:07:27,514 --> 01:07:28,243
I'm real...

1014
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:29,985
just on call.

1015
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,503
No seniority, you know.

1016
01:07:31,971 --> 01:07:33,305
Are we gonna pass the test?

1017
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:36,791
Well, just one more thing and...

1018
01:07:38,162 --> 01:07:40,413
Yep, you pass!

1019
01:07:41,246 --> 01:07:42,425
100% clean.

1020
01:07:47,443 --> 01:07:48,590
This is a wonderful day.

1021
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:50,678
Sung will be so happy.

1022
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,405
It's always nice when someone passes.

1023
01:07:52,899 --> 01:07:55,420
Thank you mister inspector, thank you
so much.

1024
01:07:56,178 --> 01:07:57,389
No problem at all.

1025
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:00,709
Have a nice day.

1026
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:28,627
Is he okay?

1027
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:29,301
Are you Sung?

1028
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:30,097
Yes.

1029
01:08:30,297 --> 01:08:32,413
Has Cyr done or eaten anything out
of the ordinary lately?

1030
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:33,778
I don't know...

1031
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:36,076
Been out of the country, have any
strange pets?

1032
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:38,149
No, whats going on?

1033
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:40,009
Quite frankly, I don't know.

1034
01:08:40,196 --> 01:08:41,356
Never seen anything like this.

1035
01:08:41,946 --> 01:08:47,880
He's got signs of Rabies, Malaria, Cholera,
Emphysema, Rubella, thrush, mumps...

1036
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,183
and at least a dozen other
diseases.

1037
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:51,313
Maybe two dozen.

1038
01:08:53,184 --> 01:08:54,492
Is he gonna be alright?

1039
01:08:54,802 --> 01:08:55,563
It's hard to say.

1040
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:56,739
His systems are ravaged.

1041
01:08:57,365 --> 01:08:58,368
He's completely susceptible to anything.

1042
01:08:58,688 --> 01:09:00,234
I'm recommending we put him in hyper
isolation...

1043
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:01,212
until he levels off.

1044
01:09:02,102 --> 01:09:02,783
You mean you're gonna...

1045
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:04,370
We're putting him in a bubble.

1046
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:11,231
Hey Cyr, how you doing?

1047
01:09:16,984 --> 01:09:18,016
Keep your head up, alright!

1048
01:09:18,844 --> 01:09:19,564
We'll get you out of there.

1049
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:24,068
Listen Cyr, I have an uncle in Hawaii.

1050
01:09:24,473 --> 01:09:25,193
He's an herbalist.

1051
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:26,944
Alright... I'm gonna go out there
and see him.

1052
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,632
Maybe he can help.

1053
01:09:29,925 --> 01:09:31,300
I'm only gonna be gone for a few days.

1054
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:34,441
So, in the meantime, just try and
get some rest.

1055
01:09:35,836 --> 01:09:37,235
Everythings gonna be ok.

1056
01:09:51,373 --> 01:09:52,057
Let's see...

1057
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:53,783
I have one Friday afternoon...

1058
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:55,357
departing LAX at 5:30...

1059
01:09:55,884 --> 01:09:58,358
and arriving in Honolulu at 7:45.

1060
01:09:58,699 --> 01:09:59,620
Great, I'll take it.

1061
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:01,996
Your confirmation will be...

1062
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:05,437
B as in boy, T as in Tom, 2X33.

1063
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:07,550
Ok and I just pick up the ticket at
the airport, right?

1064
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:08,445
Uh huh.

1065
01:10:08,896 --> 01:10:10,058
Ok, great. Thanks a lot!

1066
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:11,465
Thank you for flying.

1067
01:10:12,419 --> 01:10:14,099
All Island Air, this is Stephanie, how
can I help you?

1068
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:15,556
We want to go to Hawaii.

1069
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:17,027
On Friday.

1070
01:10:17,703 --> 01:10:18,588
Let's see...

1071
01:10:18,955 --> 01:10:20,634
I have one seat on the 5:30 flight.

1072
01:10:21,185 --> 01:10:23,017
I can put your companion on standby.

1073
01:10:23,433 --> 01:10:24,972
Ernie... Ernie.

1074
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:25,833
What's the duck say ?

1075
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:27,639
Want to fly standby?

1076
01:10:27,746 --> 01:10:28,941
Yeah, sure, anything.

1077
01:10:28,942 --> 01:10:29,942
- Sure!
- Quack.

1078
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,685
You'll both have the same confirmation
number..

1079
01:10:32,973 --> 01:10:36,252
that will be A as in Apple, B as
in Baker, 2X57.

1080
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:38,162
Thanks.

1081
01:10:38,419 --> 01:10:39,155
Thank you.

1082
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:43,261
All Island Air, this is Craig...

1083
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:44,387
how may I help you?

1084
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:49,069
Yeah, I'd like two tickets from Los
Angeles to Honolulu for this Friday.

1085
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:50,234
Let me bring that up.

1086
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,814
I understand you have an afternoon flight?

1087
01:10:51,984 --> 01:10:53,002
I'd like to be put on that one.

1088
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:54,650
With a vegetarian meal please.

1089
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:57,872
I'm sorry sir but that flight appears
to be full...

1090
01:10:58,472 --> 01:10:59,902
how about a flight the next day?

1091
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:01,744
What do you mean it's full?

1092
01:11:03,286 --> 01:11:05,639
Well that means that all the seats
have been sold...

1093
01:11:06,216 --> 01:11:07,769
and there are none available.

1094
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:08,776
That's a mistake.

1095
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,885
Check again.

1096
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:11,207
Sir, it's right here in front of me.

1097
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,157
I know how this works!

1098
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:14,062
You save the extra seats for celebrities.

1099
01:11:14,355 --> 01:11:15,007
Overbook me.

1100
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:17,460
I can't sir. The computer won't allow
me to do that.

1101
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:19,107
Are you a computer?

1102
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,948
No.

1103
01:11:20,974 --> 01:11:22,252
Then book me, you moron.

1104
01:11:23,151 --> 01:11:24,159
Just a moment please.

1105
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:27,366
No, I made all my other reservations
around this flight...

1106
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:30,429
and was specifically assured that I would
have no problem getting a seat.

1107
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:31,835
Don't try to weasel out of it now.

1108
01:11:32,557 --> 01:11:35,526
I'm sorry we are unable to satisfy
your travel needs.

1109
01:11:35,827 --> 01:11:37,200
Might I book you on another airline?

1110
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:37,926
Hell no!

1111
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,797
All my miles are on All Island Air.

1112
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:40,858
Book me on the flight!

1113
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,589
I'm sorry sir, but that flight appears
to be full.

1114
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:47,246
Perhaps I can suggest an alternate
travel time.

1115
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:48,280
Listen you dimwit.

1116
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:49,362
I need to be on that flight.

1117
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,703
Now either book me, or let
me speak to your supervisor.

1118
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:54,740
Fine, but he's just gonna tell you the
same thing.

1119
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,018
Don't patronize me!

1120
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,313
- I'm not sir.
- You have no right to talk to me like that!

1121
01:11:58,694 --> 01:11:59,794
Are you mocking me?

1122
01:12:00,004 --> 01:12:01,175
Who are you to mock me?!

1123
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,339
- Sir.
- Don't talk down to me!

1124
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:04,480
I'm a human being.

1125
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:06,141
My name is Seth.

1126
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:08,094
You know what, I'm just
trying to do my job.

1127
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:09,327
Don't talk down to me.

1128
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,980
Is it your job to talk down to me?

1129
01:12:11,231 --> 01:12:13,014
Is it your job to treat people like cattle?

1130
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,151
Yes!

1131
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:15,761
That's my job.

1132
01:12:15,951 --> 01:12:16,988
Where's your supervisor?!

1133
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:18,441
I want your supervisor!

1134
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:19,243
You've got no right...

1135
01:12:19,343 --> 01:12:20,606
Listen, you freak!

1136
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:22,349
I don't know what your problem is...

1137
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,970
and I really don't give a rats ass!

1138
01:12:24,379 --> 01:12:26,638
But if you're too stupid to book an
earlier flight...

1139
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:27,739
that's not my problem.

1140
01:12:27,938 --> 01:12:29,018
And it's also not my problem...

1141
01:12:29,572 --> 01:12:30,812
that you are a delusional weirdo...

1142
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:34,041
with nothing better to do than to
call up people and scream at them.

1143
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:37,904
Well how do you like it when it's back
at you, turd!

1144
01:12:38,172 --> 01:12:39,209
How do you like that!

1145
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:41,537
Now I have a suggestion for you...

1146
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,341
why don't you take one hand and pick
up the phone...

1147
01:12:44,442 --> 01:12:45,715
take the other hand and stick it
up your ass...

1148
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:49,822
call another airline, cause you're not
getting on this... fucking... flight!

1149
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,894
Have a nice day!

1150
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:57,352
Are they allowed to monitor the calls?

1151
01:12:58,381 --> 01:13:00,301
Their company.  They can do what
they want.

1152
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:02,160
They won't give you a second chance?

1153
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:05,690
They said I wasn't suited
for customer service.

1154
01:13:07,764 --> 01:13:09,118
Oh, god... why this is happening to me?

1155
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:10,326
It's okay.

1156
01:13:10,426 --> 01:13:11,359
No, it's not okay!

1157
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,983
I can't even keep a telemarketing job!

1158
01:13:14,249 --> 01:13:15,771
That guy sounds like a jerk.

1159
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:17,887
I think you did the right thing.

1160
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:21,190
No, we need the money.

1161
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:24,964
My paycheck will tide us over for a while.

1162
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:27,905
We'll just cut back a little more.

1163
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,182
I'm such a lousy provider.

1164
01:13:30,246 --> 01:13:31,274
You are not!

1165
01:13:32,424 --> 01:13:34,193
You've just had some bad luck.

1166
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:37,870
You're gonna find something soon.
I know it.

1167
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:42,286
Hey, hey... come on.

1168
01:13:43,267 --> 01:13:44,241
Come on.

1169
01:13:45,741 --> 01:13:47,363
We'll be fine.

1170
01:13:48,392 --> 01:13:49,922
You are a good husband.

1171
01:13:50,732 --> 01:13:53,084
And a wonderful father.

1172
01:13:53,688 --> 01:13:55,152
And that's all that matters.

1173
01:13:56,074 --> 01:13:58,074
I'm not a good husband.

1174
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,233
Of course you are.

1175
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:06,697
What's wrong, honey?

1176
01:14:07,395 --> 01:14:08,290
What's wrong?

1177
01:14:18,028 --> 01:14:19,065
Last fall...

1178
01:14:24,858 --> 01:14:26,568
Last fall, your cousin was in town...

1179
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:30,565
and something happened.

1180
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:33,309
You need to know about it.

1181
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:38,283
It only happened once.

1182
01:14:38,828 --> 01:14:40,328
I am not hearing this.

1183
01:14:42,152 --> 01:14:44,598
I'm not hearing this.

1184
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:47,851
She is my cousin, for god's sake.

1185
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,772
She is my cousin, for god's sake.

1186
01:14:50,872 --> 01:14:51,570
I know.

1187
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:53,335
I'm sorry.

1188
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:55,684
She is my cousin, for god's sake.

1189
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:56,544
Please...

1190
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:58,178
I know...

1191
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:01,710
I love you and don't know what happened.

1192
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:06,602
Yeah well, I'm not gonna be so
supportive on this one.

1193
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:12,197
Honey, I don't know what to tell you
except I'm sorry.

1194
01:15:13,693 --> 01:15:15,145
I'm so sorry.

1195
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:19,338
You should go.

1196
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,128
No, honey.

1197
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:22,835
You should go.

1198
01:16:27,586 --> 01:16:29,425
Not today!

1199
01:16:42,653 --> 01:16:43,562
How can I help you, Annelle?

1200
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:44,859
I just got this.

1201
01:16:57,223 --> 01:17:00,113
Gee, that's... angry.

1202
01:17:00,303 --> 01:17:01,358
I'd like to prosecute.

1203
01:17:02,065 --> 01:17:07,715
Yeah it is simple assault... and
a death threat.

1204
01:17:09,574 --> 01:17:10,613
A couple of them.

1205
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:14,453
Sure.

1206
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:16,908
Call it in.

Hey... Wallace Gregory?

1210
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,497
Yeah.

1211
01:19:31,697 --> 01:19:34,249
Sir can you step down from the vehicle.
We need to talk to you a second.

1212
01:19:36,575 --> 01:19:37,438
Just right over here.

1213
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,120
You're under arrest Mr. Gregory.

1214
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,067
What for?

1215
01:19:42,475 --> 01:19:44,479
Well how about for making a
terrorist threat.

1216
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:45,605
Sound familiar?

1217
01:19:46,288 --> 01:19:47,365
You make me sick.

1218
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,700
No!

Marty.

1221
01:19:59,034 --> 01:20:00,567
Just give me a minute.

1222
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:01,728
Will you just give me a minute, please.

1223
01:20:04,264 --> 01:20:08,291
Marty, hey, Marty. Show
me what you're holding.

1224
01:20:11,539 --> 01:20:13,309
Show me what you're holding!

1225
01:20:18,108 --> 01:20:19,476
That's the wrong part.

1226
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:22,016
That's been recalled!

1227
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,612
It's defective!

1228
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,519
It's okay.

1229
01:20:29,183 --> 01:20:32,146
Just ah, just get the right part.

1230
01:20:33,331 --> 01:20:37,191
It's in a blue box marked SL423.

1231
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:42,261
Just get Antonio or Beth and have
them install it, ok?

1232
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:43,678
Okay?

1233
01:20:44,122 --> 01:20:45,232
So, are you finished now?

1234
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:46,597
Yeah, I'm done.

1236
01:20:47,424 --> 01:20:48,442

It's alright!

1240
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,378

Ok, I'll make sure.
