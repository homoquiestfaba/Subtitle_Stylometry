You know how these

Big burst of energy
at the beginning

12
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:15,407
because everybody's really
excited about the campaign.

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,143
And then you get a big burst
of support at the end

14
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,845
because everybody
wants to be the hero

15
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,513

I mean, I haven't
sent any emails yet.

19
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,687
I mean everything's been
super general to this point.

20
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,457
You gotta send the personal
stuff because that's what,

21
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,459
you know, really gets
people involved.

22

saying I wanna do it.

I'm saying I think we
should consider it.

24
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,131
- They put up a tree.
- What?

25
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,733
- The rental company,
they put up a tree.

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,871
- I think it's kinda nice.

27
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,706
- Yeah.

28
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,808
It makes certain assumptions
though, don't you think?

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,677
- I guess so.

30
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,212

34
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,123
- Can we have a
conversation that's

35
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,791
just in the vicinity of reality?

36
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,227
I mean, I'm not saying I
don't believe in miracles...

37
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,395
- Miracles come in moments,
be ready and willing.

38
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,731
- But I know they would
help us, I mean, look,

00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,693
they've talked about selling
this place for years!

40
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,895
- We are not asking your
parents for the money.

41
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,138
We will find it a different way.

But the thing is you also
gotta have intelligent people

175
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,352
or it's just a disaster.

176
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,790
- Yes, yes.

177
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,391

poker with people

00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,518
- I think you have
to put a new...

181
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,543
- I just got the
look, so um, uh.

182
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,337
It was 10 years ago

183
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,275
that we moved back to the valley

184
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,045
with trepidation in our souls

185
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,180
and hope in our hearts.

186
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,749
And it was only through
your friendship

187
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,391
that we made it through
those early years.

188
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,319
You painted scenery,

189
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,754
you hauled costumes,

190
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,222
you got drunk with
us on the floor

191
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,258
when we didn't have
any furniture.

192
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,064
But no matter what
heartache or broken toes,

193
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,066
or mold-induced asthma
the months brought,

194
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,402
you always got
together with us here

195
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,324
at Nessa's family's cabin
to celebrate New Years.

196
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,338
- Yay.

197
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
- And so I just wanna say,

198
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,775
to our nearest and
dearest friends,

199
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,243
thank you for being here with...

200
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,846
- Steve, actually, Jodie
and I have something

201
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,183
that we'd like to contribute
to the toast this year.

202
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,452
- Babe, maybe wait
'til he's finished.

203
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,353
- We know where he's
going with this, right?

204
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,924
Friendship and their
theater, uh, and the usual

205
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,094
but we just thought while we're
talking about friendship

206
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:13,331
that it was a good time
to share some news.

207
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,867
Steve, if you don't mind.

208
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,389
- Not at all buddy,
the floor is yours.

209
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,870
- Thank you.

210
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,872
Tada!

211
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,474
- Bryce, you made something...

212
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:23,908
- Is it, is it...

213
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,010
- It's a home brew,
it's like an aperitif.

214
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,345
- Now he brews all
his own stuff.

215
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,315
You can really taste the
weedkiller in the domestics.

216
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,150
- Fucking Monsanto.
- Fucking Monsanto.

217
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:37,122
- Considering our audience,
we thought that the best way

218
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,091
to share our news would be

219
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,159
to perform it.

220
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,130
So, everyone gets a roll.

221
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,800
- How fun!

222
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,336
- And if you'll just open these,

223
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,172
and read them

224
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,374
in order,

225
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,344
we have the number.

226
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,545
- Is this like a riddle?

227
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,114
- No, each person has a line

228
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,950
and then you just
read it, in order.

229
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,118
- Oh, it's like a round.

230
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,987
Like a poem told in a round.

231
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,390
- I believe Sadie's says start.

232
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,927
- This is so exciting.

233
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:16,929
Fancy.

234
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,466
"Our darling friends so close,

235
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,035
"the time has come for a toast."

236
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,440
- "We've had a
good six-year run,

237
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,410
"but our relationship
is now done."

238
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,354
- "The fact is,
Bryce wants babies,

239
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,090
"and Jodie does not even maybe."

240
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,533
- "We're at the end of our wits

241
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,136
"so we're calling it quits,

242
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,172
"but we'll stay friends
because love doesn't die."

243
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,142
- So lift your glasses up high.

244
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,144
Come on.

245
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,949
And toast to new friends,
and not goodbye.

246
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,415
To friends.

247
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,486
- To friends.

248
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,171
- We just wanted to let
you know that we're okay.

249
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,343
We still love each
other, we just

250
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,579
can't be together anymore.

251
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,582
- Guys...

252
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,350
- This is intense.

253
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,390
- You really don't want
babies, like ever?

254
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,425
- Come on, Sadie, you
knew that about her.

255
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,428
- Well, I just thought
that was a phase.

256
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,710
I mean, we're thinking about it.

257
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,331
- What?
- Not tomorrow.

258
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,813
- Isn't full frontal
in your contract?

259
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:36,668
- And you have, food allergies.

260
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,403
- Well, aren't you
thinking about it?

261
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,637
- The theater is our child.

262
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,706
- You have to have
sex to be pregnant.

263
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,275
We just, we have
different priorities.

264
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,111
- But this is human life!

265
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,614
I mean, you can't tell
me that as artists,

266
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,856
you think your life would be
complete without that, like,

267
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,586
essential human experience,
raising a child, molding a life.

268
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,556
Uh I don't know,
what could be more

269
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,491
primal or dramatic?

270
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,460
- So I'm sorry, what
you're saying is that

271
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,062
a person has to have a child

272
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,196
in order to have a
complete human experience?

273
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,497
- I didn't say that, actually.

274
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,739
- Don't take the bait, Vanessa.

275
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,233
- No, I wanna know.

276
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,168
- Guys, we don't have
to do this now, okay?

277
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,369
- We're cool to start, right?

278
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,603
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,439
Jodie changes the world
with her photography.

280
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,161
She has literally sparked
political upheaval

281
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,342
with her work... - I know!

282
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,744
- And so you want
her to what, quit?

283
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:21,145
- No I don't, I don't
want her to quit.

284
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,047
- There are 10 billion people

285
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,482
stretching this
planet's resources

286
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,984
to the breaking point.
- Yes, we know.

287
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,087
- You guys, you got her
started, this is the...

288
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,769
- What if their kid's
like the next Mozart?

289
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,123
- That's no pressure
or anything.

290
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,192
- What if their kid's
a serial killer?

291
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,474
- Or an asshole.
- Or an asshole!

292
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:37,595
- Okay, yeah, so the
world's gonna end

293
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,677
and we're all doomed, so...

294
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,298
- No, the world is not gonna end

295
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,701
- So what, we're supposed to
just give up, stop living,

296
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,604
and write bitter,
depressing plays about it?

297
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,139
- No, but the world is
changing and I think

298
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,440
that there are
choices other than

299
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,009
"I just want them
'cause I want them."

300
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,344
- Right, because having
children is selfish.

301
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,480
- Oh well, selfish
or not, apparently,

302
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,549
I'm not a complete human being
so I better stop with all my

303
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,671
crazy lady thought writing
and start breeding already!

304
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,587
- Steven, tell her I'm
not being selfish.

305
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,523
- I think a thing is
neither good nor bad,

306
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,425
but thinking makes it so.

307
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:13,097
- Equivocator.
- That is deep.

308
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,402
Was someone gonna say grace?

309
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,072
- You guys, enough.

310
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,674
I don't want to solve
global warming tonight.

311
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,477
I just wanna get
drunk and have fun

312
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,480
with my friends, who
are breaking up.

313
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,450
Are we gonna have to divide
custody like two New Yearses?

314
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,620
- No, Sadie...
- Honey, honey, no.

315
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,489
Look, we still love each other.

316
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,126
We just don't wanna
procreate together.

317
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,562
- Yeah, so if you have
any single friends...

318
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,198
- This brie is blowing my mind!

319
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,467
- I...

320
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,535
- Seriously.

321
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,138
- To mind-blowing brie.

322
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,640
- To mind-blowing brie.

323
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:56,774
- To mind-blowing brie.

324
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,785
- Can we get some meat, please?

325
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,690
- What is this,
the 18th century?

326
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:36,514
- You know what can we just
leave them out a minute?

327
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,416
- Oh, darlin'.

328
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,487
- I really missed you girls.

329
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,427
- Steven just posted
something funny

330
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,262
on the theater's Facebook page.

331
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,232
- Get off your phone, Steven!

332
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,502
I just can't get him to...

333
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,504
present.

334
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,708
- I think I'm gonna die
my hair this color.

335
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,885
- I just got a friend
request from TPITH.

336
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,559
Spammers should be like
eaten by zombie wolves.

337
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:25,796
- That's uh, The
Play's The Thing.

338
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,698
- Steven's theater

339
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
that he's always talking about.

340
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,171
- Yeah, you know,
"The play's the thing

341
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:37,241
"wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the King."

342
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,910
It's Hamlet.

343
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,881
You know Hamlet?

344
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,318
Shakespeare Hamlet?

345
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,690
Seriously? Not even like,
Mel Gibson Hamlet?

346
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,692
- What are they teaching
kids these days?

347
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,262
- You don't know it?

348
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,664
Dude, no, seriously.

349
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,865
You're gonna love this.

350
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,800
This is a great story, right.

351
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,771
So Hamlet is this prince,
young guy, right?

352
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:11,776
He's called home from school
because his dad is dead.

353
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,845
So he's gotta come home
for the funeral, okay?

354
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,616
When he gets home, he
finds out that his mom

355
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,984
has remarried, like already.

356
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,853
His dad is not even
cold in the ground,

357
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,855
she's remarried, right?

358
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:29,760
She's remarried to his
uncle, his dad's brother.

359
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,829
And his dad's brother,
his uncle has decided

360
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,764
that he should be
the king, right?

361
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,635
- And then he wrote that poem,

362
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,803
and I just... - Oh god.

363
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,739
- I couldn't...
- This whole thing

364
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,374
belongs on YouTube.

365
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,677
- What did I miss,
did I miss a funny?

366
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,313
- Where are you gonna live?

367
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,781
- I don't know.

368
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,284
I mean, Bryce'll
want me to stay, but

369
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,820
I'll just find a gig out
of town, something.

370
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,291
- You can stay with us!

371
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,692
I mean Jude's place is huge.

372
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,861
It's a little huge
messy but you know.

373
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,896
- Thank you, I don't
wanna impose.

374
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,631
- Are you...

375
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,934
- Relieved?

376
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,572
I don't know.

377
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,841
It's all logistics right now.

378
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,779
Here's the fun facts.

379
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:59,016
Documenting third-world poverty
does not pay very well.

380
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,920
- What are you gonna do?

381
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,855
- Shoot porn.

382
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,797
Well, thanks for the support,
you little assholes.

383
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,801
- It can be very tasteful.

384
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,939
- Maybe this will help.

385
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,609
- Mmm, are we about to go
on a magic carpet ride?

386
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:28,813
- Jude brought it
back from Tulum.

387
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,948
- It looks...
- Illegal?

388
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,049
- Okay.

389
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,090
- Uh...

390
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:40,092
- To, uh...

391
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,626
- Mm-hm.

392
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,972
- Horacio cradling his
head in his arms,

393
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:57,575
Fortinbras bursting
into the throne room

394
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,477
with his armies behind.

395
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:01,946
He dies.

396
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,151
"Good night, sweet prince,

397
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:12,089
"and flights of angels
sing thee to thy rest."

398
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,172
- I gotta write a
song about this.

399
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,876
People need to hear this story.

400
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,445
- You should come down
to the theater sometime.

401
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:37,982
We do this every day,
man, twice on Sundays.

402
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,053
- It would be so much better
if you didn't have to beg.

403
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,923
- Yeah, it would.

404
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,794
- No, I just mean, you know,

405
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:53,097
it's always like,
"Here's the airplane,

406
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,033
"open up, open up, please!"

407
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:02,139
It's just not like that
with litigation support.

408
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,712
- No, I don't imagine
it would be.

409
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,001
- Aww.

410
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:34,906
Oh.

411
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,908
- That is wrong.

412
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,116
- Play it again, play it again.

413
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,853
- That was a great
year for movies!

414
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,888
Rocky 4 came out that year.
- Yeah, but it's not...

415
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,557
- Rocky 4 is an incredible...

416
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,125
- It's no witness.

417
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,047
- Well, it might be a
little better than witness.

418
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:58,896
Rocky 4's incredible!

419
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,265
- I mean, it...
- Not better than E.T.

420
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,267
- Come on!

421
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,771
- Why is this so compelling?

422
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:11,609
- Because kittens no
nothing of Congress.

423
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,210
- This, he's thowin'
boulders, right,

424
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,946
he's carrying logs on his back.

425
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:22,119
- The ab thing!
- Like, 45 degrees.

426
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,155
- I can't do any ab things.

427
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:27,758
- Dude, he doesn't even, he
doesn't even go out of shape.

428
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,028
- He trims though.
- Yeah, no.

429
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,999
Get it, kitty, get it.

430
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,041
- No but seriously, what's
going on with the script?

431
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,135
Have you heard anything?

432
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,169
- Racist?

433
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,170
- I think it's racist.

434
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,038
- No!
- Yes.

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,873
- Seriously?

436
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,874
- Yeah!

437
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,677
- What's racist?
- Come on, come on.

438
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,846
Hold on, he's a cold-blooded
Russian fighter,

439
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:52,082
who comes to America, is
on steroids, by the way,

440
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,184
kills his best friend,
seemingly on purpose,

441
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,587
which the entire Russian
population thinks is awesome

442
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,723
because obviously, they too
are cold-hearted and evil.

443
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,085
- We're at the end
of the Cold War,

444
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,726
it's a commentary
on the whole time!

445
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,368
- Wait wait wait, in
all the other movies,

446
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:06,392
he just goes around
beating up black guys.

447
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,866
- Come on!
- He does.

448
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:12,803
- All right, I'm gonna
walk you through it.

449
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,365
We're gonna start back
at the beginning.

450
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,774
Rocky I, he loses that fight.

451
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,142
- But...
- He loses it.

452
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,313
- What happened?

453
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,085
- They have agreed
to run my story.

454
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,720
- And?

455
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,590
- If I can find my way
to Rwanda and back.

456
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,824
- Drago!

457
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,697
- It's so good!
- Okay, okay.

458
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,199
- That is basically
my point, basically.

459
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,868
- I'm just not
feeling it anymore.

460
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,170
- Dude.
- What?

461
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,805
- Plus, Paulie gets
that sweet robot.

462
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,239
- He does.

463
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,810
How many times did we...
- I loved that movie.

464
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,678
- We saw that movie, we went to,

465
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,747
this guy went to
Rockython with me.

466
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,782
- Rockython?
- Yeah, Rockython.

467
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,219
We wore like flag shorts
and everything, come on!

468
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:05,656
- It was different,
we were different.

469
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,193
- We're weren't different.

470
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,229
- If you say so.

471
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,333
- Plus, he got brain
damage in that fight.

472
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,002
He did, yeah.

473
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,838
- No, nope, nope, we don't
talk about Rocky 5.

474
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,072
Nobody talks about,

475
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,741
Stallone doesn't even
talk about Rocky 5.

476
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,309
That movie is not,

477
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,113
but Balboa, we get back to
Balboa and the end movie!

478
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,017
And that one ends the story.

479
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,019
- Hi.

480
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,721

cheating going on!

493
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:27,137
There's some kind of
vaginal telepathy.

498
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,050
- Yeah um, oh.

499
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,286
Two truths and a lie. - Boo.

500
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,188
- Oh, no, no, come on!

501
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,730
We haven't played
that since college.

502
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:47,925
- There's a reason for that.

503
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,359
- I don't know that game.

504
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,228
- It's easy.

505
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,363
Okay, for example um,

506
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,332
A, I have a third nipple,

507
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,835
uh, B,

508
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,839
eggs give me terrible gas,

509
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:02,841
and uh, C,

510
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,311
I have a birthmark in the
shape of New Jersey.

511
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,146
- C.

512
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:12,015
- Sadie, cable is the
Naked You channel.

513
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,284
We have seen it.

514
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,353
- And smelled it.

515
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,921
- You have a third nipple?

516
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:22,392
- Okay okay okay, my turn,
I wanna go, I like this.

517
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,027
All right.

518
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,865
A, my favorite kind of
pie is strawberry pie.

519
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,803
B, I once ate 15 cheeseburgers

520
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:36,240
and then barfed them
all up on stage.

521
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,243
C, my new single
just went platinum

522
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,044
in Japan.

523
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,283
- How many is that?

524
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,019
- That's like 250,000 something.

525
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,390
Like, at least, that can't be.

526
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,392
It's C, right? We're
gonna go with C.

527
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,427
It's C, definitely C.

528
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,398
- Ah, fuckin' C.

529
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,268
I have no poker face, man.

530
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,803
We went platinum in Germany.

531
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,038
We're trying for Japan but...

532
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
- What?

533
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,242
- Jude, that is...

534
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,478
That is awesome.

535
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,815
Congratulations, man.
- Yeah, thank you!

536
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,283
- That's incredible.
- Thank you!

537
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,051
Yeah, we just...

538
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,487
We let this one flow and
it just kinda worked out.

539
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,289
You know, it was really organic.

540
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,524
- I'm sure it was.

541
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,428
- Why don't you go next, buddy?

542
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,865
- Okay, A, I think argyle socks

543
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,366
are more stylish than solids.

544
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:39,870
B, I have an aversion
to electric staplers.

545
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,540
C, women who are mothers are
35% more likely to be happy,

546
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,009
healthy, and report a
greater sense compassion

547
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,345
and purpose in their lives.

548
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,083
- Is that true?

549
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,605
I don't think that's
true 'cause my mom

550
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:55,519
is a very mean person.

551
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,355
- You know, I have always
hated this game and uh,

552
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,124
we have due
resolutions so let's,

553
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,292
can you do resolutions?

554
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,493
- What?
- Resolutions.

555
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,495
- Oh, ah...

556
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,597
Well, I...

557
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,899
Um.

558
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:13,604
I did resolve to raise
$70,000 by Tuesday,

559
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,138
so I have that.

560
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,108
There is that, and um,

561
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,764
I don't think have anything
else other than that right now,

562
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:25,215
so uh Sadie, you go.

563
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,417
- No, I'm not ready,
you go, Jodie.

564
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,187
- Jodie doesn't believe
in resolutions.

565
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,556
- Okay fine, um, okay.

566
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,325
I resolve to be kinder, and...

567
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,233
Accept things that
I can't control,

568
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,436
and you know, not obsess
over skinny bitch actresses

569
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,438
who are stealing all my parts

570
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,507
you know, because I
really do love them

571
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,478
in my heart of hearts, and
jealousy only hurts me

572
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,350
and I just want the
best for them even if I

573
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,619
secretly want them to
develop warts and die.

574
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,424
- I think Sadie just modernized

575
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,394
the serenity prayer
for us, guys.

576
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,363
- Thank you.

577
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:17,601
I want you to resolve to
save me from these jerkoffs.

578
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,270
- Aw, come on!

579
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,272
- I resolve to save Sadie
from you jerkoffs.

580
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,478
And I resolve this
year to be happy.

581
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,517
- You just decide to be happy?

582
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,452
- Yeah.

583
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,454
- I just see these dudes like

584
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,691
deciding to lose
five pounds, right?

585
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,259
Or like learn a language,

586
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,594
or like watch less
porn or whatever,

587
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:48,231
and I don't think it
makes them any happier.

588
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,435
Are they really
happy being like,

589
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:54,071
"Pass the TV" in French?

590
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,672
- It's a phrase.
- Is it?

591
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,194
- I'm sure it's really
easy for someone

592
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:58,675
with your life to be happy.

593
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,117
- How do you resolve
to make yourself

594
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:02,141
happy this year, Bryce?

595
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,084
- Well, I don't know.

596
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,419
I guess I haven't
really thought about

597
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,121
what it's gonna be like to be

598
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,756
solo in the new year.

599
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,696
But I guess I resolve...

600
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,203
Yeah, I resolve to find someone,

601
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,274
to find someone who
shares my values

602
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,411
and who wants to have
children with me.

603
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,430
Resolution.

604
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,334
- He's on a spectrum, isn't he?

605
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:01,805
I had a cousin once who used
to say the gnarliest shit.

606
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,473
Man, no judgment.

607
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,444
- 250,000 records?

608
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,312
- I know.

609
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:11,615
- That's huge.
- Yeah.

610
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:13,750
- What is that even like?

611
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,665
- Do you still love him?

612
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,373
- I mean, he's on
another planet tonight.

613
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,443
But...

614
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:42,479
I'm not the easiest person
to live with either,

615
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:43,713
I mean, I'm...

616
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:51,788
It was just really nice to
have someone to come home to.

617
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,795
What is happening?

618
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,297
Sadie, why is that?

619
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,631
You are not a lesbian.

620
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,333
What is going on?

621
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:07,304
- Come on, Jo, everyone
is a lesbian sometimes!

622
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,140
Look, Bryce is an asshole.

623
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,809
And you, you, you're just this,

624
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,247
this smart, talented woman

625
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,649
and you deserve to be loved.

626
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,553
Where's your sense of adventure?

627
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,455
Look, it is New Years.

628
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,525
And Jude, Jude would
be right into it.

629
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,394
You could move in with us.
- No, Sadie, no.

630
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,762
Okay, Sadie.

631
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,764
Stop it!

632
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,902
- Nobody love me.
- Oh, babe, no.

633
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,637
- Nobody.

634
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,373
I mean they all think I'm
fuckable, I'm good to look at.

635
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:47,477
Even Jude, even Jude
will leave eventually.

636
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,311
- No.

637
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,313
- You don't understand.

638
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,717
This business is brutal.

639
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:57,187
I spent $200
yesterday on a cream

640
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,422
to brighten my arms.

641
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:03,894
No seriously, bright arms is
a job requirement for me.

642
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:08,331
You, you are just this
artist spreading truth.

643
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,168
Truth, you know, and beauty.

644
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,571
I just, I just, I
just idolize you, Jo.

645
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,240
And I'm gonna die
shriveled and alone.

646
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:19,843
- You are not going
to die alone!

647
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,712
Now, look at me.

648
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,581
Remember, Vanessa's
invited us all to live

649
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,717
on her survivalist
eco-commune in Canada?

650
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,286
It might be cold all the
time and have to churn

651
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:30,253
your own butter but...

652
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,454
- I'm a terrible friend.

653
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:33,957
- I'm terrible.
- Stop.

654
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,826
Vanessa's not gonna let
me into her commune.

655
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,796
- Babe, what are
you talking about?

656
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,766
- I don't wanna talk about it.

657
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,733
- Sadie.

658
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,435
Sadie.

659
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,437
What?

660
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,644
- My agency dropped her script.

661
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:56,846
- Oh.

662
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,915
- Because my agent's...

663
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,817
My agent dropped me.

664
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,453
You know, I wasn't booking.

665
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,622
And so I went in to visit him.

666
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:07,691
And he said that maybe
now was a good time

667
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:10,293
to start writing a cookbook.

668
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,695
- Oh, Jesus.

669
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,830
- I mean my manager's
trying to find me something

670
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,866
but he says that age
might be a factor.

671
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,401
- I want to carpetbomb
your industry.

672
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,703
- No, I am a good actor.

673
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:22,372
I'm a really good actor
when I work hard.

674
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,908
And Nessa's script
is really good.

675
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,410
And she's so very
fucking talented,

676
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,945
and I can't, I can't help her!

677
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,881
And I can't help you and I just,

678
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,953
I just wanna die.

679
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,856
♪ And the girl with
the strawberry hair

680
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,859
♪ Is like an angel in despair

681
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,462
♪ She teased me with her eyes

682
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,832
♪ When I'm touching
up on her thighs

683
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,368
♪ What would she want with me

684
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,004
♪ I'm just a dude
who loves the sea

685
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:56,906
♪ But if she really wanna fly

686
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,909
♪ She gotta be really high

687
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,612
- Maybe this is a gift
from the Universe.

688
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,847
Jude and I will have a baby.

689
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,850
Or I'll write that
cookbook for actresses

690
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,885
struggling with food
allergies, you know,

691
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:13,523
and maybe I just need to,
I just need to dig deeper

692
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,793
and live in the moment
and really embrace

693
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,030
the beauty that is this
experience, you know,

694
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,798
and just remember that

695
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,036
we're all just actors on the
stage of life, you know?

696
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,906
Yeah.

697
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,445
- Are you better?

698
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,317
How much of that was
acting, like, 40%?

699
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,520
- You're the worst.
- Oh, you're a nerd!

700
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:46,924
Oh.

701
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,895
- Oh my god!

702
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:54,497
Vanessa's pregnant! - Shh, shh.

703
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,500
- Oh my god, Vanessa's pregnant!

704
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,936
What are we gonna do?
We should start saving!

705
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,072
- We're gonna play a game,
we're gonna play a game.

706
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:05,408
We're gonna yell so loud so
that the whole house hears us.

707
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,676
- Oh my god.

708
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,411
Wait, how much did
she have to drink?

709
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,013
You can have muskal
when you're pregnant?

710
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,548
- No, don't ever
ever ever have kids.

711
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,382
- What? Why?

712
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,616
I'm like, really good...

713
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:17,554
She just tries to spit out
half of what she drinks.

714
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,988
With the pudding
and the Sigma Nus.

715
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,591
- So that maybe we
should do is...

716
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,728
- So what we're gonna do
is just march out there

717
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,663
like we don't know anything

718
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,932
and you never
sexually-assaulted me,

719
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,867
and nothing ever happened.

720
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:31,935
- No, wait a minute...

721
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,670
- Nothing.

722
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:37,140
♪ And that's why I'll behave

723
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:40,009
♪ Always gonna be her slave

724
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,446
♪ And we'll kiss forever after

725
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:47,684
♪ Because her bondage
is my master ♪

726
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:51,821
- Wow!

727
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,159
- Who is buying that?

728
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,028
- Germans.

729
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,130
- Totally.

730
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:01,798
- You guys really like it?

731
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,900
I messed it up a little bit.
- Nah!

732
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,834
Yeah.

733
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,404
- I fucked it up a little bit.

734
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:08,646
- It's really beautifully felt.

735
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,706
- Aw.

736
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,907
- Really was.
- Thanks, guys.

737
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,010
I mean, when you
find your muse...

738
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,017
- We should down to
the theater sometime.

739
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,919
We could do like a night of

740
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,488
music and spoken word, you know.

741
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,924
Yeah, yeah, like we
do this fundraiser,

742
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,893
I'd pay you a stipend.

743
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:33,663
- Be careful, Jude,
you gotta be careful,

744
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,932
because it starts
there and then it's

745
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,169
come to all my shows
and donate money.

746
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,838
And wait.

747
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,506
Wait, wait.

748
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,574
Wait for it.

749
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,079
We got eight inspirational
quote tweets in two hours.

750
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,715
- Come on!

751
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,117
- You know what
this reminds me of?

752
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,886
This is like legit
deja-vu right now.

753
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,088
Spring semester, senior year.

754
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,056
- No, no!

755
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,559
- Yes, he has to know!

756
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,895
He must know the tale! - God.

757
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,932
Jude, Jude, check it out.
- Yeah.

758
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:13,102
Okay, so Steven was making
us crazy for months

759
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:17,006
workshopping his thesis
performance, his opus.

760
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,077
I'd gone through six, maybe
seven costume designs.

761
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,513
You used to do costume
designs, right?

762
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,747
- And he still wears them!

763
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,683
- Yeah, but he was
really good at them.

764
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,117
He was.

765
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,620
- Sadie had gone through
six or seven hair colors,

766
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,922
Vanessa had done like
a million drafts,

767
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:36,192
and Steven, in his
infinite wisdom,

768
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,028
decides to cast Tyler Darrington

769
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,931
in the lead role.

770
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,000
- Tyler like Blues
Village Blues Tyler,

771
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,969
with Faith Darrington's kid?

772
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,537
- That's Tyler Darrington.

773
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,672
- And Tyler wasn't a star
yet, but with that family,

774
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,542
it was just a matter of time.

775
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,144
Well, Steven knew that
if Tyler was in it,

776
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,981
his family would come see it,

777
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:01,251
so we begged and we begged...
- No, no, you didn't!

778
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:05,288
- Steven not to do
it because, you see,

779
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,257
aside from being
relatively talent-free,

780
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,559
Tyler was, how do I
put this gently,

781
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:11,227
a shitstain of a human being.

782
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,530
- He could be really nice.

783
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,131
- Didn't you sleep with him?

784
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,166
- No, that's my sister.

785
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,202
- He would only agree

786
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,741
to do it if the performance
was during the finals week,

787
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,383
what with the family
cruise of Greek Isles

788
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:27,677
coming up and everything.

789
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,212
So Steven knew that
this was gonna be

790
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,915
pretty hard on us
but he persevered.

791
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:33,850
And you know why?

792
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,185
It's 'cause he had a vision.

793
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,620
He did.

794
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:40,189
He had a vision of the
brilliant production

795
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,724
that we would mount,

796
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,928
and of how the Darringtons
would surely,

797
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,996
like modern-day Medicis,

798
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:52,268
become our patrons and
shower us in so much money

799
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,871
that we'd be doing art!

800
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,839
With goddamn capital A!

801
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,209
Forever and ever, amen.

802
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,879
And Tyler was terrible.

803
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:06,683
He showed up to rehearsal
baked out of his gourd

804
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,852
every day, and for
weeks, none of us slept.

805
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:13,323
Sadie's hair fell out,

806
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:17,193
Vanessa developed
a bleeding ulcer,

807
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,128
but Steven was undeterred.

808
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,296
He was convinced.

809
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,298
He was convinced that
if he could just

810
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,267
teach Tyler to learn his lines,

811
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,669
and be a decent human being,

812
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:29,839
and not do all the
blow in the world,

813
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:35,311
that everything would
turn out fine in the end.

814
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,913
- Did it?

815
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,817
- Fucker never showed up.

816
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,122
Steven read his lines
from a binder.

817
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,091
Vanessa lost her grant.

818
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,859
And my father
nearly disowned me.

819
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,160
- Oh he did not.

820
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,830
The department asked
him to write a paper

821
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,965
and I helped, it was fine.

822
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,400
- Was it fine?

823
00:43:57,402 --> 00:44:00,169
Because I remember that
that it was abject misery

824
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,939
but, fuck it, you know what?

825
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,273
Let's do it again.

826
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:08,077
Let's see how far up Jude's
ass your nose can go.

827
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,279
I'll come out of retirement
and do the costumes

828
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:11,681
for old time's sake.

829
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:12,749
What do you say, guys?

830
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:13,983
To starfuckers!

831
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,218
- Man, what the fuck
is your problem?

832
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,119
- What the fuck is my problem?

833
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,053
I don't have a problem.

834
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,255
What the fuck is your problem?

835
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:22,792
Yes, you pick and you
pick and you pick.

836
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,827
Do you think I like
busting my balls

837
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:25,995
20 hours a day to
keep this thing...

838
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:26,796
- Honestly, I don't know.

839
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:28,031
- No, you wouldn't know.

840
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,353
Do you know why you
wouldn't know?

841
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:30,900
Because you sold
out to take a job

842
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:32,769
at your daddy's
accounting firm, right?

843
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:34,237
Who's your biggest client now?

844
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,672
Is it Pornopalooza?

845
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,173
Or, no, no, sorry,
it's that chain

846
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,042
of dry cleaners downtown, right?

847
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,484
Either way, really
great contribution

848
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:42,111
to society there,
buddy, seriously.

849
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:45,148
- Fuck you, man, I am so
sick of your bullshit.

850
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,982
- Bryce.

851
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,750
- No, it is bullshit!

852
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:50,033
You think that you are so much
better than the rest of us.

853
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:53,156
You're so goddamned high and
mighty with your thee-ay-tah

854
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:55,191
that you shove down
our fucking throats.

855
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:59,228
And guess what,
newsflash, no one cares.

856
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,997
We all have to
pretend like we do,

857
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,719
and like we think it's
worth all the trouble

858
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,767
for you to raise
$70,000 by Tuesday

859
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,936
or God forbid Van Nuys
will have one less

860
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:08,805
black box production
of King Lear.

861
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:09,967
- Fuck off.
- Well, it's true.

862
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,974
- You think I don't know that?

863
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,142
Huh?

864
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,779
You think I like having
to beg my friends

865
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,247
to come and see our shows?

866
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:21,050
You think I like being
the harrassing-est

867
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,486
Whitman-quotingest
motherfucker alive?

868
00:45:23,488 --> 00:45:25,722
What's the alternative,
buddy, huh?

869
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,190
Let another art form die,

870
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:30,293
let it just fade away into
some sort of oblivion?

871
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:33,029
If we were in any other
industrialized fucking country,

872
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,932
we were in any other
industrialized country right now,

873
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:39,435
I just don't even have the
time and the patience

874
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,037
to get into that.

875
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,305
I just, I just...

876
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,409
I just wanna run a food truck.

877
00:45:47,251 --> 00:45:48,411
I just wanna run a food truck

878
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,213
like every other fucker in L.A.

879
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:52,175
And just drive around when
I want and where I want

880
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,317
and have my biggest
fucking problem be

881
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,755
that I smell like fucking
pot pies when I come home.

882
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,423
Fuck!

883
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,061
- Wait, Vanessa,
you're pregnant!

884
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,331
We found the pregnancy test.

885
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,033
- You're pregnant?

886
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,374
That's why you wanna
talk to your folks.

887
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,042
- Okay.

888
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:21,043
- It's because you're
pregnant, no that's cool.

889
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,846
That's great, no
that is awesome!

890
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,017
- Thank you very much, Sadie.

891
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,152
You are best.

892
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,290
Steven!

893
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,431
Steven.

894
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:43,299
- I don't wanna talk to
you right now, Vanessa.

895
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,433
- Okay, can we just...

896
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,335
- I am killing myself,
killing myself

897
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,404
to keep this thing
afloat and I am sorry

898
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,306
if that makes me a
terrible husband

899
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,042
and holy fuck, a
terrible father.

900
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,243
- Okay, okay.

901
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:55,311
But to keep this from me,

902
00:46:55,313 --> 00:47:01,384
And what was all that shit at
dinner about overpopulation?

903
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:04,420
Were you planning some sort
of abortion or something?

904
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,557
Why wouldn't you just come to
me and talk to me about it?

905
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,492
- I am not pregnant!

906
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,095
You think you're the
only miserable one?

907
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,331
I have written 12
award-winning plays

908
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,134
and I have made more money
in one summer walking dogs

909
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:24,073
I teach Don Quixote to angsty
teenagers all day long

910
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,342
and then I come home to more
work and a husband who is

911
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,543
too tired to touch me!

912
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,478
And no, I'm not pregnant.

913
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,147
I took a test
because I was late,

914
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:34,317
and it scared the
living shit out of me,

915
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,286
because we have no money
and no time and no energy

916
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,648
for anything else
but this theater!

917
00:47:38,672 --> 00:47:40,122
- Oh okay, you wanna quit?
Go ahead.

918
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:44,327
Oh oh oh, great! Oh great,
great, and do what?!

919
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,896
- I don't know care!
- And do what?!

920
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:50,466
- I'm not trained to
do anything but this!

921
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,003
- Sell jewelry on the
Santa Monica pier!

922
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,205
- Jewelry, are you
fucking kidding?

923
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,975
Why don't we just become mines!

924
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:00,243
Huh? Why don't we just.

925
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:01,925
I've always wanted to
be a train conductor,

926
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:03,726
I mean, maybe I'll get
a job at Disney Land!

927
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:05,314
No no no, I got it, I got it.

928
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,583
Why don't we come up with the
next fucking juice cleanse

929
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,505
'cause I think there's a
real fucking opportunity

930
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:10,553
for that right now...

931
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,189
- Why don't we, Steven?
Why don't we?

932
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:14,590
- You don't get to make this
decision for the two of us,

933
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:15,524
okay?

934
00:48:15,526 --> 00:48:17,393
We went into this together.

935
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,629
This is a partnership,
so that's why!

936
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,164
- When was the last time
we ate dinner together?

937
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,532
Or took a walk?

938
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,334
Or slept a full night
without panic flailing!?

939
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:27,370
- 10 years, 10 years!

940
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:28,652
We've been in this for 10 years!

941
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:30,373
You can't just walk
away from that,

942
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,675
it's 10 years of our life!

943
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:34,510
- Walkin' away!
- Oh.

944
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,413
Oh that's, that's, that's...

945
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,414
That's great! - Here I go!

946
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,349
- Yeah? Yeah, me too!

947
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,550
- Great!

948
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:42,518
- Fuck this!

949
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
I'm out!

950
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,456
See you later!

951
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:48,958
- Fine!

952
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,502
- Oh, guess what?

953
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,072
Sadie has agreed...

954
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,045
to do a commercial.

955
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,580
- What?

956
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,618
For the firm?

957
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,620
- Yeah.

958
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,590
- It's so sweet of you
to help your friends

959
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:24,560
with all of their
little projects.

960
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:27,363
You're such a generous soul.

961
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,965
- Yeah, when she told me she
was having money trouble,

962
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,433
I just thought why not trade?

963
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,535
I'm sure she's not the only
person with tax issues.

964
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:36,572
Some of her fans are a mess
too, so, it's a no-brainer.

965
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:39,675
- That's great.

966
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:22,685
- Sadie?

967
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,591
Open the door.

968
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,660
Sades.

969
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,364
Sadie.

970
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,668
What the fuck?

971
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:45,041
- Help me in the kitchen.

972
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,686
- Why didn't you tell me?

973
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,058
- I was...

974
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,530
I don't know, it was
humiliating, I was in

975
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,697
I was afraid.

976
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,667
- Afraid of what?

977
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,404
- That you'd leave me.

978
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,108
- Why would I leave you?

979
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,077
- Because...

980
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,847
Because I'm like this freak.

981
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,582
I'm like this...

982
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,119
I'm like this little
performing monkey that's like

983
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,787
loose and unemployed
in the streets

984
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,823
and everybody know who I
am and they're all like,

985
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:38,461
"Oh, look at that little
poor, dancing monkey.

986
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,329
"Isn't it time she
writes a cookbook?"

987
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,865
And I'm like "No,
no I still have it.

988
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,334
"I promise, look
look, I can dance!"

989
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,336
And they're like "Mm, actually,

990
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,872
"your agent has a younger,
sexier monkey now

991
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,541
"and come to think of
it, we like her more."

992
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:55,244
- Is it because I
called you monkey face?

993
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:57,413
I didn't mean that, my gam
gam used to call me...

994
00:51:57,415 --> 00:52:00,649
- I'm trying to tell
you that I am failing.

995
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,884
I'm a failure.

996
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,386
And I'm stuck.

997
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,824
And my money, all the
savings are all gone.

998
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:18,634
I have all the money.

999
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,537
I mean like, I have
all the money!

1000
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,275
You're such a little dummy.

1001
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,511
Why didn't you come to me?

1002
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:51,333
- None of this is
going how I planned.

1003
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,335
None of it.

1004
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,807
- They didn't like your poem.

1005
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,846
- Well that's reductive.

1006
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:40,482
- They don't teach
you about this.

1007
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,453
Soul-crushing...

1008
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,490
disappointment.

1009
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,964
- Let's just skip
the disappointment.

1010
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,267
I'm tired, skip it.

1011
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,935
- No, we can do better.

1012
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,471
Right? We can do better.

1013
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:04,940
We'll sell the car, we'll um...

1014
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,879
Can talk to your parents,
I'm okay with that.

1015
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:12,982
I just don't think we could...

1016
00:54:12,984 --> 00:54:13,984
- No.

1017
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,592
- But there's gotta be trust.

1018
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,863
It's a spiritual,
spiritual experience

1019
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,734
and it can't be taken
lightly but...

1020
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,871
Do you trust me?

1021
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,408
- Yeah.

1022
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,410
Yeah.

1023
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,479
I do.

1024
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,524
- I think we made
a huge mistake.

1025
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,902
- At least the food was awesome.

1026
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,371
- I crushed that roast.

1027
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:45,774
- You really did
crush the roast.

1028
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,512
- So...

1029
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:53,816
Mime.

1030
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:57,052
You want to mime? - Oh, come on.

1031
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,670
You're not gonna let me
live that one down, huh?

1032
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:05,527
That's the one you're
gonna stick with, okay.

1033
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,765
It's cool, it's great.

1034
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,637
We're in a lot of trouble.

1035
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,948
- We're gonna be okay.

1036
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,951
- I've never...

1037
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,554
had anyone be so
honest with me before.

1038
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:07,756
- Oh honey, it feels so good.

1039
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,091
- It feels so good.

1040
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,927
- Oh, god, I wanna always
be that honest with you.

1041
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,195
- Yeah?

1042
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,763
- Always.
- Forever?

1043
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,325
- Let's just tell each
other everything.

1044
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,666
- Everything.

1045
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:19,735
- No secrets.
- No secrets.

1046
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:22,571
No secrets, oh, ah can
I tell you a secret?

1047
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,039
Yeah I wanna do it.
- Clean slate.

1048
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,441
- Clean slate.
- Totally.

1049
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:26,442
- Totally.
- Clean slate.

1050
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,510
- Square from this day...

1051
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,580
- I can be square.
- I can be square.

1052
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:36,452
- Okay I'm gonna tell you
the deepest secret I have.

1053
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:38,086
- I'm gonna tell you one.

1054
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,054
- What?

1055
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,022
- Okay.
- Okay?

1056
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,557
- Deepest-darkest secrets.

1057
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,192
- Deepest-Darkest secrets.

1058
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:44,126
- Together?

1059
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,862
- Together, together, together.

1060
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,096
- Okay.

1061
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:50,199
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

1062
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,733
- Yes.

1063
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:52,735
Yes.

1064
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,571
Yeah. - Okay.

1065
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:56,773
- Okay, on the count of three.

1066
00:57:56,797 --> 00:57:59,798
Ready?

1067
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:01,910
- One.

1068
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,146
Two.

1069
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,115
Three.

1070
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,986
- In love with anyone.

1071
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,025
- Are you okay?

1072
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,193
- Yeah.

1073
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,695
- Are you sure?

1074
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,932
Oh honey, I love you so much.

1075
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:28,170
I love you so much, I just don't
love your music, you know?

1076
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,211
- You're the worst.

1077
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:37,613
- Wait, what?

1078
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:38,881
What? - You're the worst.

1079
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,682
- Wait, I thought we
were being square?

1080
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,964
You said deepest-darkest secret.

1081
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:43,986
- Oh my, what!
- Baby, baby!

1082
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,654
- What's happening?
What's happening?

1083
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,990
- I'm an artist, Sadie!
- Oh no no no no.

1084
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,291
- What the fuck?
- I love you.

1085
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,959
I love you! - Whoa!

1086
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:52,027
Are you tryin' to kill me?

1087
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,128
Are you tryin' to kill me?

1088
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,830
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1089
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:56,064
- We can work around it!

1090
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,534
- Oh we can work around it.

1091
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,056
We can work around it!
- Listen listen.

1092
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,037
- Honey, if were an
accountant, would you like,

1093
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,939
expect me to love math?

1094
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:04,773
No!

1095
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:05,774
No, right?

1096
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:07,910
But what if, what if, what if,

1097
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,845
what if you were a
baker, you know?

1098
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:12,614
Because I'm allergic
to bread, you know!

1099
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:15,784
- But you're not not saying
you don't love music.

1100
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,654
You're saying you
don't love my music!

1101
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,589
Like, like hey Mr. Baker-man,

1102
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,991
I love bread, but your bread

1103
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,594
tastes like shit, right!

1104
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:27,195
- No that's not what I mean.

1105
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,517
- But that's what you're saying,
that's what you're saying.

1106
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,866
Honey, no.

1107
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,067
- Okay, okay so, so...

1108
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,068
- That's not what I'm saying.

1109
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,603
- Okay so I'm gonna go!

1110
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:37,072
I have to go now.
- Don't go, don't go.

1111
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,074
- Because you just took

1112
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,176
a huge

1113
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,579
wet

1114
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,147
dookie in my soul,

1115
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,750
and I have to relocate

1116
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,020
my happiness. - No!

1117
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,188
- Somewhere else.
- No!

1118
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,056
- Okay?
- No!

1119
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,191
- Away, away.

1120
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:59,795
- Please don't.
- Yeah.

1121
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:02,264
- Please.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,150
- No.

1123
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:23,185
No.

1124
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:27,723
And you love me, and that,
that can be enough.

1125
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,257
For a while, right?

1126
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,926
Look, you wanna do the
journalism thing?

1127
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,768
That is fine, that is
fine, I was subsidize it,

1128
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:35,097
and you can get it
out of your system.

1129
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,099
That's not what I, um.

1130
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,168
Journalism is dying, it is
dying and I will sit shiva

1131
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,938
with you while it
dies and then maybe

1132
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,140
you can do this for me.

1133
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,810
Relationships are
about sacrifice.

1134
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,045
Jodie, please.

1135
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,386
I don't work without you.

1136
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,908
Did Sadie spray you
with her perfume?

1137
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,277
Um, let's talk in the morning.

1138
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,212
Okay.

1139
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,448
We'll talk in the morning.

1140
01:01:54,011 --> 01:01:55,011
- Fuck!

1141
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,486
- This is so much fun.

1142
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,060
- I'm not pregnant!

1143
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:16,798
- You know, I think the whole
forest is clear on that, babe.

1144
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,468
- I just need my pants.

1145
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,435
Pants.

1146
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:21,870
All good.

1147
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:25,006
This is, it's really
nice out tonight, huh?

1148
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,108
- Gorgeous.
- Really.

1149
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,342
- Really beautiful.

1150
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,810
- And there's a
really great moon.

1151
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,346
- Mm-hm, the big
dipper I think is out.

1152
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:34,149
- No I'm good, I'm good.

1153
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,218
You guys have a great...

1154
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,319
New.

1155
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:38,321
Bye.

1156
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,958
- I am naked in public!

1157
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,495
- Well, I think your bra,

1158
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,298
may have run away, darling.

1159
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:53,335
Purple.

1160
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,337
Should we see if he has
any weed in here, oh.

1161
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:58,106
- I am free-boobin' it.

1162
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,141
- Oh that's it.

1163
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:01,911
Darling.

1164
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,349
We should go back inside, right?

1165
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,521
- Try me, I'm posh.

1166
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:18,293
Think he's lookin' for that.

1167
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:22,330
- But I thought it'd be funny.

1168
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:29,004
- Think there's one
in the kitchen?

1169
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,441
- Hey.

1170
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,448
- I'm goin' home.

1171
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,284
Yeah, I don't need this shit.

1172
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:43,286
You know?

1173
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,354
I can't find my keys!

1174
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,256
Oh, she hates my music.

1175
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,426
Oh yeah, well, well boning
a vampire on national

1176
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:54,262
television's total
capital A art!

1177
01:03:58,468 --> 01:03:59,868
Oh.

1178
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,036
Oh.

1179
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:02,404
Oh, god.

1180
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:04,206
God.

1181
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,544
I can handle it from my mom.

1182
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:12,480
From my brother, you know.

1183
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,282
'Cause they're just,
they're just jealous.

1184
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,285
They're a-holes.

1185
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,420
But from Sadie?

1186
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,989
Oh, Sadie.

1187
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,623
- It's okay, buddy.

1188
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:22,490
- Oh, I know!

1189
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,359
- Nope, it's okay.

1190
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,361
- Oh yeah, think I'm dying.

1191
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,495
I'm gonna die!

1192
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,432
Oh my god I can't breathe,
oh my god I can't,

1193
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:32,868
there's a big fat guy, I swear
to god there's a fat guy,

1194
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,604
and he's sitting on my
chest, he's just dooking.

1195
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,141
- Sadie?

1196
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,947
Sadie.

1197
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:48,116
Honey, if you keep doing that,
your teeth are gonna rot

1198
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:51,286
and then who will want you?

1199
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,088
Sadie!

1200
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,256
Stop it.

1201
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,272
- He just chucks this
chicken over the fence.

1202
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,941
Oh god.

1203
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,943
And now I feel responsible.

1204
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,379
I don't know what else to do
but just tuck it into my arm

1205
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,414
like a football and
just run, you know?

1206
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:25,520
- Yeah, that thing took it
like a champ, I tell you what.

1207
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,424
- And now the PETA
office has a new mascot?

1208
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,425
- Uh-Huh.

1209
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,060
Yep.

1210
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:34,062
They named it Jodie.
- Oh, exceptional.

1211
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,499
- Yeah, it was.

1212
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:40,468
It really was.

1213
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,203
- Oh no, no!

1214
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,538
Is this downer-weed?

1215
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,540
No!

1216
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,508
- No.

1217
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,276
Darling.

1218
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,479
The human condition
is the downer.

1219
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,581
I'm a downer.

1220
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,649
The world...

1221
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:57,118
is a downer.

1222
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,486
- You're saving the world.

1223
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,523
You have to save the
world, I want you to.

1224
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,426
Take your important pictures
and save the world.

1225
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:07,095
- Why don't you save the world?

1226
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:08,097
I'm tired.

1227
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,569
I made $11,000 last year.

1228
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,477
I don't know, maybe I should
have a kid with Bryce.

1229
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,412
I could just...

1230
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:29,017
buy all the things, become a
functioning alcoholic and,

1231
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:31,519
you could save the world.

1232
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:34,255
I mean, somebody has to
speak for the trees and the

1233
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:38,326
children and the bees and
the ozone layer and...

1234
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,628
I'm so tired.

1235
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,608
Maybe I'll open an Olan Mills.

1236
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,679
- Are you having a
nervous breakdown?

1237
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,184
- Yeah.

1238
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,491
Yeah, I think I am.

1239
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,710
- What's happening in here?

1240
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,481
- I'm floating in a
field of love...

1241
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,750
and acceptance.

1242
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,089
- And forgiveness.

1243
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,060
- And forgiveness.

1244
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,566
Man, you should charge
money for this, Steven.

1245
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,735
Lots and lots of money.

1246
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,719
- Sadie.

1247
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,488
- Are you stoned right now?

1248
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,125
- Sadie, come out,
we're floating

1249
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:20,295
in a field of love
and forgiveness

1250
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:22,330
and acceptance.

1251
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,632
- Have pie with us.

1252
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,336
- I have a little bit
of food poisoning.

1253
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,705
- Oh, baby.

1254
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,141
Well honey, if you keep doing
that, your teeth will fall out

1255
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:36,778
and then, how are you
gonna have Nessa's pie?

1256
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,780
Or mine, or anyone's?

1257
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,133
- No judgement tonight, Sadie.

1258
01:08:58,135 --> 01:09:00,268
Nothing but love,

1259
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,270
acceptance,

1260
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,271
forgiveness.

1261
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,539
- Pie.

1262
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,741
I want pie. - Mm-hm.

1263
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:09,677
- Yeah.

1264
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,528
- Well this feels like a
night for announcements.

1265
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:08,803
We're closing the theater.

1266
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:09,938
- What?

1267
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
- Yeah.

1268
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,541
It's time.

1269
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,910
- Wait, what are
you guys gonna do?

1270
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,281
- We don't know.

1271
01:10:20,283 --> 01:10:23,818
Declare bankruptcy, probably.

1272
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:26,754
Make a bunch of movies with you.

1273
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,593
Go to mime school.
- Open a food truck.

1274
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,528
- Really?
- I'm just kidding.

1275
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,698
- Well that's good, man,
because food trucks are like

1276
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,935
so five minutes ago, seriously,
it's not a good idea.

1277
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,609
- Do you have to kill every
moment of happiness?

1278
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:48,676
You ass-hat!

1279
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:50,578
- Whoa.

1280
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,580
- Whoa?

1281
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:54,782
Whoa?

1282
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:56,344
- Hey, get away from
me, you psychopath!

1283
01:10:56,368 --> 01:10:57,552
- Yeah?
- Stop it, Steven.

1284
01:10:57,554 --> 01:10:58,786
- Is this happening?
- Stop!

1285
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,858
- You've been living a lie.

1286
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,828
If you don't my music, then
what is it you love about me,

1287
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,597
- What are you gonna do
when you catch me, Steven,

1288
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,466
inspire me to death?! - Baby.

1289
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:12,700
- No, stop!

1290
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:15,837
I can't believe anything
that comes out of that lying

1291
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,538
mouth of yours!

1292
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,408
Do your friends even know
that your agent dropped you?

1293
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,944
Like some little old, fat chick,

1294
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:27,048
that you've just been
spewing lies like some

1295
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,017
lying, lying lie-cano!?

1296
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:31,886
- Wait, wait wait wait.

1297
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,721
Is the script dead?

1298
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:37,992
- You knew.

1299
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,996
That is some cold shit.

1300
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:45,900
- Oh, god!

1301
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,869
- And I am not fat!

1302
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:50,505
- Because you never
digest anything.

1303
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:51,906
- Baby!

1304
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,942
Baby? - Ah, don't.

1305
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,878
Don't touch me, don't touch me!

1306
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,546
Ever, don't touch me.

1307
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,308
- I know you're all
tapped out and everything

1308
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:03,051
- If you could just refrain from
shitting all over my dreams

1309
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:05,320
for like a second,
that'd be nice!

1310
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:06,842
- What, is that what
Steven said to you

1311
01:12:06,866 --> 01:12:09,824
- Is that what Bryce said
to you, when you made him

1312
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,060
choose between having him
and having a child?!

1313
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:13,828
- Oh, that is a low-blow.

1314
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,763
- Oh yeah, well your
mom's a low-blow.

1315
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,833
- If you hate everything
I do so much, why,

1316
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,501
why are you even here?

1317
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:22,003
- Oh no, no.

1318
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,005
Shit!

1319
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,841
These are Japanese
Selvedge denim!

1320
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:36,985
Christ.

1321
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:50,064
- Come on, man.
- Run, motherfucker.

1322
01:12:50,088 --> 01:12:50,998
- No, what the fuck!

1323
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,667
- Would you just listen to me?

1324
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:54,135
Look, yes, yes I lied.

1325
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:57,739
And no, I don't love your
music, but I love your passion!

1326
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:58,973
How much you try!

1327
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:01,042
You're not always gonna
love the work that I do

1328
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:02,977
but that doesn't make
you love me any less

1329
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,780
and I know that you love
me because you wouldn't

1330
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,616
be this pissed right
now if you didn't.

1331
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,597
- And that's why I behave!

1332
01:13:22,599 --> 01:13:24,465
- Sweetie, sweetie...
- Always gonna!

1333
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:25,467
- Shh.

1334
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,735
- Wait.

1335
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,406
You hate that song too.

1336
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,907
- It could be tweaked.

1337
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,410
- I wrote that song for you!

1338
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:36,911
Oh, motherfucker!

1339
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:42,116
God!

1340
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,553
Pie.

1341
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:46,921
Pie.

1342
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:51,626
- No, Vanessa!

1343
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,909
Honey, you know I love you but
you cannot change the world

1344
01:13:53,933 --> 01:13:55,696
with a studio comedy! - Oh yeah?

1345
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:57,198
What changes the world?

1346
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,034
Miss Artiste, tell me,
with your infinite wisdom!

1347
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:00,968
- Greed!

1348
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,870
Greed, greed changes the world.

1349
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,840
And, and, and corporations
buying elections,

1350
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:09,076
and Halliburton he changes the
world, you know, Dick Cheney,

1351
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,111
that guy?

1352
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,393
- You know what your problem is?

1353
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,575
It's that you operate under
the illusion that this

1354
01:14:14,599 --> 01:14:16,451
starving artist routine
is somehow noble,

1355
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,019
when what it really is,

1356
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:21,055
is just an excuse not
to grow the fuck up.

1357
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:22,557
You wanna know what's noble?

1358
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,592
Providing your wife
with health insurance!

1359
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,062
- Is that what it means, huh?

1360
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:30,384
Sellin' out and takin' a job
that sucks the life out of you

1361
01:14:30,386 --> 01:14:32,419
until you're nothin' but a
dried-up husk of regret

1362
01:14:32,421 --> 01:14:33,601
and ball cancer?

1363
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:37,905
- You know who does?

1364
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:40,575
Religious zealots
that feed people,

1365
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,543
you know, make
change in the world!

1366
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:45,680
And, and, Cultural Hegemony!

1367
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:46,948
- You know what I really think?

1368
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,083
I think you just can't stand it.

1369
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:52,153
You can't stand that you were
this big star in college,

1370
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:56,057
and now you're a total failure
and I have a sailboat.

1371
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:57,124
- Do you wanna go there?

1372
01:14:57,126 --> 01:15:01,896
Who was it that was too
afraid to even try, huh?

1373
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:04,499
Too scared that his
dad would disown him

1374
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,033
if he went to design school.

1375
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:09,136
Yeah, my theater failed, but
we had a great fucking run.

1376
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:13,007
I have a great fucking wife,
and I have integrity.

1377
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:16,244
But $100 haircut, some
stupid suspenders

1378
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:19,113
and a closeted sewing fetish.

1379
01:15:25,154 --> 01:15:27,555
- Fuck! God-damnit.

1380
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,964
- Stories change
the world, Jodie.

1381
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:39,200
I know you're really depressed,

1382
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:44,138
and I don't know how you're
gonna pay your student loans...

1383
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,576
but you just need to tell
yourself a different story.

1384
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,916
We just need a different story.

1385
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:13,569
- Why.

1386
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,203
Why I behave.

me and they tweeted a picture

about it so they came back

1428
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:45,686
