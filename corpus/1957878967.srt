I BETTER NOT.
MY DAD STAYED HOME
FROM WORK TODAY.

177
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,951
IS HE OKAY?

178
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,152
OH, SURE, HE'S GREAT.

179
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:02,555
IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE NEEDS A LITTLE EXTRA REST.

180
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,558
COOL.
WELL, CALL YOU TOMORROW, MAN.

181
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,494
PEACE OUT, MAN.
YEAH.

182
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,804
HEY, DAD, I'M HOME.

183
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,383
DAD?

184
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,020
DAD?

185
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,490
DAD?

186
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,027

00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,612
HI.

00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,614
MOM WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

194
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:38,251
MAGGIE AND AUNT CELESTE
WILL BE HERE SOON.

195
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,187
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

196
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:46,192
KINDA LIKE I'M--
I'M KNOCKING ON HEAVEN'S DOOR.

197
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:51,030
SEE, A JOKE.

198
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,566
YOU'RE GETTING BETTER ALREADY.

199
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,436
YOU'RE GONNA
LICK THIS THING, DAD.
I JUST KNOW IT.

200
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,440
HEY, MOSES,
THERE'S SOMETHING I--

201
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,177
SOMETHING I GOTTA TELL YOU

202
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,479
THAT I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY
BEFORE.

203
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:10,116
IT'S OKAY.
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

204
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:13,119
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY,
MY MOTHER USED TO...

205
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:17,523
HAVE THIS POSTCARD COLLECTION.

206
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:22,528
MY FAVORITE
WAS THIS PAINTING

207
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,133
OF THIS GOLF COURSE.

208
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,306
THIS WAS THIS--

209
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:38,044
THIS HUGE COUNTRY CLUB.

210
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,314
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

211
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,016
I WANTED TO GO THERE.

212
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,652
DAD-- DAD, YOU SHOULD REST.

213
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,688
MOM WILL BE BACK
ANY MINUTE.

214
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,225
AND I WAS DREAMING

215
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,229
THAT THAT GOLF COURSE
WAS HEAVEN.

216
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,364
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

217
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,533
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN.

218
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,402
[laughs, coughs]

219
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,572
DAD, DON'T.

220
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,545
CLAY?

221
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,416
YOU GOTTA PROMISE ME
SOMETHING.

222
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,218
SURE, ANYTHING.

223
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,655
ME AND MY FATHER,

224
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,224
WE WEREN'T VERY CLOSE.

225
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:29,061
YOU GOTTA TELL
YOUR GRANDMAMA

226
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,398
AND-- AND YOUR GRANDPAPA

227
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,637
I ALWAYS LOVED THEM.

228
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,176
FIND THAT POSTCARD FOR ME.

229
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:47,380
IT'LL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND
OUR FAMILY.

230
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,149
PROMISE.

231
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,219
HMM?
I PROMISE.

232
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,234
[exhales]

233
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:11,470
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

234
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,232
[classical music playing]

235
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,848
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH DAD'S STUFF?

236
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,751
JUST FOLDING,
GETTING THINGS ORGANIZED.

237
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,421
YOU'RE GIVING IT AWAY,
AREN'T YOU?

238
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,557
NO NO, HONEY.

239
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,261
THESE ARE ALL GOING RIGHT BACK
WHERE THEY BELONG.

240
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,396
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO MISSES HIM.

241
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,899
THEN WHY ARE YOU PLAYING
THIS MUSIC HE HATED?

242
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:23,502
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
HE'S GONE, YOU CAN DO
ANYTHING YOU LIKE.

243
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,338
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU DIDN'T FIGHT HARD ENOUGH

244
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,573
TO GET HIM OFF
THOSE STUPID HERBS AND VITAMINS

245
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,842
INSTEAD OF TAKING REAL MEDICINE
AND DOING THE JOB--

246
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,179
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
IN MANY COUNTRIES
THAT STUPID STUFF

247
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,181
IS REAL MEDICINE.

248
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,783
DON'T FORGET
THAT KEPT HIM ALIVE
FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS.

249
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,688
HOW DO YOU KNOW
CHEMO WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED
AND KEPT HIM ALIVE FOREVER?

250
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,727
I DON'T.

251
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,363
THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER.

252
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,204
I'LL HANDLE THESE SHIRTS!

253
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,643

HERE YOU GO.

256
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,391
MOM, I NEED ONE MORE.

257
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,393
MAGGIE, THERE ARE
ONLY THREE OF US.

258
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,529
WHAT IF DADDY'S SPIRIT
IS HUNGRY AND COMES BACK?

259
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,407
GOOD THINKING.

260

DINNER'S READY.

00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,644
I THINK YOU SHOULD
EAT SOMETHING.

265
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,979
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

266
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,716
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY
THAT YOUR DAD LEFT YOU.

267
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,922
WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE,
JUST TAKE SOME TIME

268
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,825
TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT HE LEFT YOU.

269
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,594
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

 YOU HAVE TO WALK

WHY ARE YOU JUST STANDING THERE

SO I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DROPPED YOUR TRAY

IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CAFETERIA.

301
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,831
I KNOW.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO EMBARRASSING.

302
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,734
THEN THE CAFETERIA LADY
GOT ALL MAD AT YOU.

303
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,737
LET'S SPLIT.

304
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,140
IT'S SORT OF GETTING
KIND OF DARK IN HERE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

305
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,878
YEAH, MAYBE THE OREO TRIPLETS
WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE.

306
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:10,449

00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,260
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
THIS LACK OF INTEREST

335
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,863
IN CURRENT AFFAIRS.
YOU THINK IF IT'S HAPPENING
TODAY, IT'S NOT HISTORY?

336
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,769

337

I GUESS IT ALL STARTED
WITH THE BAY-OF-PIGS INVASION

344
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,942
WHEN THE C.I.A.
TRIED TO KILL CASTRO.

345
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,010
CASTRO THREATENED
TO GET EVEN.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD
WAS A CASTRO SUPPORTER.

00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,060
APHRODITE
WAS GODDESS OF WHAT?

873
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,028
SEX.

874
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,264
[all laughing]

875
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,268
LOVE. APHRODITE
WAS THE GODDESS OF LOVE,
MR. CROSBY.

876
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,637
 NO, DAD, STOP IT.
 STOP STOP.

877
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,073
SEX AND LOVE ARE NOT
NECESSARILY THE SAME THING.

878
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,775
YEAH, LIKE YOU'D KNOW.

879
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:07,844
[All]
OOH!

880
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,313
WE ALSO SAID
THAT IT WAS RATHER IRONIC

881
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:13,650
THAT APHRODITE,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF GODDESSES,

882
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,287
MARRIED HEPHAESTUS.
WHY IS THAT, MISS CALMENARI?

883
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:21,291
SHE HAD TO!

884
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,761
MR. CROSBY,
IS YOUR NAME MISS CALMENARI?

885
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,196
[all laughing]
UH-NUH.

886
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:28,899
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
TO CONTINUE,

887
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,636
ZEUS THREW HEPHAESTUS
OUT OF HEAVEN

888
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:35,105
AND THE FALL RESULTED
IN A PERMANENT LIMP.

889
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,975
YOU'D LIMP TOO, MR. DORFMAN,
IF YOU WERE MARRIED TO
THE GODDESS OF SEX.

890
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,678
[all laugh]

891
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,718
[Bruce]
THAT WAS SO FUNNY, MAN.

892
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,922
YOU WERE A GAS IN ENGLISH
WITH THAT APHRODITE STUFF.

893
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,790
JUST LIKE YOUR OLD SELF,
MAN.

894
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,396
YOU UTTER ONE WORD
AND YOU'RE DEAD.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

895
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,399
YOU'RE GONNA
WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY
AS IF NOTHING'S WRONG

896
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,401
AND WE'RE GOING TO WALK
OUT OF THE SCHOOL

897
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,136
AND THEN
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

898
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,337
OH!

899
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,906
[boys chattering]

900
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:13,677
NO, NOT ANOTHER DETENTION.
MY OLD MAN'S GONNA KILL ME.

901
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,952
[Richard]
DAMN GENERATOR.

902
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,088
ALWAYS SQUEALING.
[grunts]

903
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,356
HEY, BOY.

904
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:33,296
HEY, DAD, HOW WAS WORK?

905
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:37,200
[grunts]
THE ELECTRICAL BUSINESS
DON'T PICK UP,

906
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,871
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THAT FACTORY AND OPERATE
THAT DAMN DRILL PRESS.

907
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:43,840
[grunts]

908
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,076
HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL?

909
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,979
'CAUSE IT'S 4:00.

910
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,381
4:00?
YEAH.

911
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:56,720
A MAN SHOULD STILL BE WORKING
AT 4:00.

912
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,955
I GUESS.
WHAT?

913
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:01,057
YOU GUESS?

914
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,261
WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT WORKING? HUH?

915
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:12,002
I PUT HOT FOOD ON THE TABLE
FOR BOTH YOU AND YOUR SISTER.

916
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,838
WHO THE HELL
YOU THINK PAYS FOR THAT?

917
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,707
HAND ME THAT WRENCH
OUT THAT TOOLBOX.

918
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,313
[wrench clanging]

919
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,215
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU BOY?

920
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,350
CAN'T YOU HOLD ON
TO ANYTHING? HUH?

921
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,353
YOU SISTER SAYS SHE WANT
A BRAND-NEW CAR.

922
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,156
WHO DOES SHE THINK I AM,
ROCKEFELLER OR SOMEBODY?

923
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,759
AH, THIS WRENCH
IS TOO BIG.

924
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:38,295
GO IN THE GARAGE
AND GET ME A SMALLER ONE.

925
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:40,764
AND MAKE IT QUICK, BOY.

926
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:55,946
POSTCARD, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE HERE.

927
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,858
LET'S SEE.

928
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:17,200
GRANDMA.

929
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,071
WHERE'S THAT WRENCH, BOY?

930
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,573
JACKPOT! I GOT 'EM.

931
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,977
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD
FOR YOU, BOY, YOU'LL HURRY UP.

932
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:29,012
UH-OH.

933
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:31,314
WHERE ARE YOU, POSTCARD?

934
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,883
MAKE IT QUICK, BOY!

935
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:37,087
IF YOU WANT THING DONE
AROUND HERE, YOU'VE GOT
TO DO IT YOURSELF.

936
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,758
COME ON, GET IN THERE.

937
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,100
WHAT IS TAKING YOU
SO LONG, BOY?

938
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:55,872
MMM!

939
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,957
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
CALLED TODAY.

940
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,625
SHE MISSES YOU.

941
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,229
SAYS SHE FORGETS
WHAT THE TWO OF YOU LOOK LIKE.

942
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:22,866
ANYWAY, SHE'S INVITED US
UP FOR THE WEEKEND.

943
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:26,269
THERE'S A WINTER CARNIVAL
WITH GAMES AND ANIMALS.

944
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,239
WANNA GO?

945
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,876
I WANT TO GO.

946
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,481
[knock on door]

947
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,484
COME IN.

948
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,187
MIND IF I PUT
THIS STUFF AWAY?

949
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,923
SURE, MOM.

950
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,402
IF SOMETHING WERE BOTHERING YOU,
YOU'D TELL ME, RIGHT?

951
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,438
RIGHT.

952
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:04,107
SO YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

953
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:08,378
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT...

954
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,047
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
ON ANYTHING.

955
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:14,284
ALL I THINK ABOUT
IS DAD.

956
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,252
YEAH, I KNOW.
ME TOO.

957
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,387
REALLY?

958
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:20,557
YOU KNOW, WE GET IMPATIENT
WITH MAGGIE

959
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:23,693
BECAUSE SHE PRETENDS
DADDY'S AT THE TABLE

960
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,695
OR SINGING HER TO SLEEP.

961
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,398
BUT IN OUR OWN WAY,
WE DO THE SAME THING--

962
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,600
PRETEND, PLAY GAMES.

963
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,669
WE JUST
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.

964
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,404
I THINK WE SHOULD.

965
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,139
I GUESS.

966
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:43,079
MOM, WHY WAS GRANDPA SO MEAN
TO DAD AND AUNT CELESTE

967
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,081
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS?

968
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,420
WELL, I DON'T THINK
HE INTENDED TO BE MEAN.

969
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,990
I THINK HE WAS
JUST DISAPPOINTED.

970
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,659
IN WHAT?

971
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:01,097
HIMSELF,
THE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES
FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS.

972
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,500
SEE, HE'D DONE ALL THESE
HEROIC THINGS IN THE WAR

973
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,635
AND KEPT DEMOCRACY ALIVE.

974
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,505
AND THEN HE GOT BACK HOME
AND NOBODY CARED.

975
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:11,341
SO HE MARRIED YOUNG,

976
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,344
HAD A FAMILY
AND JUST SETTLED.

977
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:17,347
AS YOUR DAD
AND AUNT CELESTE GREW OLDER,

978
01:05:17,347 --> 01:05:21,985
HE SEEMED TO BE RESENTFUL,
ALMOST JEALOUS OF THEM.

979
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,386
WHY?

980
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,155
THEY WERE YOUNG;
THEY HAD THEIR LIVES
AHEAD OF THEM.

981
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,557
HE'D GIVEN UP HIS DREAM
OF BECOMING A DOCTOR

982
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,692
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEM.

983
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:32,228
DID DAD GIVE UP
HIS DREAM FOR US?

984
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,764
OH.

985
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

986
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,003
YOU AND MAGGIE
WERE HIS DREAM.

987
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:42,705
YOU KNOW, SOME MEN
WERE BORN TO BE FATHERS.

988
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,475
YOUR DAD WAS ONE OF THEM.

989
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,048
SLEEP WELL.

990
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:53,950
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

991
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,553
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK
YOU HAD FORGOTTEN THE WAY.

992
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,755
WE STOPPED
FOR BREAKFAST.

993
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,128
HI, GRANDMA.

994
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,799
MY SWEETNESS.
LET'S SEE YOU.

995
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:45,501
DON'T STAND THERE WITH
YOUR TEETH IN YOUR MOUTH
LIKE THAT.

996
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,404
COME A LITTLE CLOSER SO I CAN
GET A BETTER LOOK AT YOU.

997
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,242
SOMETIME TODAY, BOY.

998
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,512
HI, GRANDPA.

999
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,424
COME ON, HELP ME
WITH THESE BAGS, BOY.

1000
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,738
[Clay thinking]
 SAME OLD JUNK.
 SOME THINGS JUST NEVER CHANGE.

1001
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,423
OKAY, GUYS,
LET'S GET IT RIGHT.

1002
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,726
THE POSTCARD'S IN THE GARAGE
NEXT TO THE ROLLER SKATES.

1003
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,713
MMM!

1004
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:13,256
[D.J.]
Here's a little tune
you can groove to.

1005
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,358
[bebop playing]

1006
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,762
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have seen some
sizzling skaters

1007
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,899
so far here this evening
at Scooter's Rollerway.

1008
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:26,602
You can leave your cares behind
and let your dreams come true.

1009
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,505
Now I know the judges
had a hard time making up
their minds,

1010
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,474
but they have done it.
In a couple of minutes,

1011
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,243
we'll have the performances
of our two finalists.

1012
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,547
In the meantime,
here's one more tune
you can bop to.

1013
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:39,549
I SAID THE GARAGE.

1014
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,656
WAY TO GO, MAN.

1015
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,725
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINALS.

1016
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,727
THESE SHOES
HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN.

1017
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,462
WHAT'D YOU SAY, FRANK?

1018
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:56,199
I MEAN THESE SKATES
HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN.

1019
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,968
IF THEY'RE NOT LACED TIGHT,
I COULD TWIST MY ANKLE.

1020
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,970
I THINK YOU LACED THEM
A LITTLE TOO TIGHT.

1021
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,206
THEY CUT OFF CIRCULATION
TO YOUR BRAIN.

1022
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,742
HURRY UP.
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW
MORE MINUTES TO WARM UP.

1023
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,947
THESE SKATES
ARE PRETTY CRAPPY.

1024
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,716
NOW BLADES--
THAT'S THE WAY TO GO.

1025
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,485
YOU GUYS
SHOULD INVEST IN THEM.

1026
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,986
BETTER YET, INVENT THEM.

1027
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,956
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
ON SKATES BEFORE.

1028
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:22,925
HOW YOU GONNA
WIN THE COMPETITION
WITH DORKY STEPS LIKE THAT?

1029
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,794
WHAT COMPETITION?

1030
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,497
DUH, THE COMPETITION

1031
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,699
THAT YOU AND YOUR SISTER
MIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN

1032
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,701
IF YOU STOP ACTING
LIKE SUCH A SPAZ.

1033
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,603
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1034
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,671
COME ON!

1035
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,340
 THESE THINGS
 ARE DANGEROUS.

1036
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,546
I NEED A REST.

1037
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,681
HEY, DORK!
AH!

1038
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,517
I'M GONNA WHIP YOUR BUTT
OUT THERE, CROSBY--

1039
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,420
YOU AND
YOUR STUCK-UP SISTER.

1040
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,423
LET ME GO!
[laughs]

1041

1152
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:26,775
OH MY GOODNESS,
I PUT THAT OLD MACHINE AWAY
YEARS AGO.

1153
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:30,779
YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER
LOVED MALTEDS TOO.

1154
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,882
YEAH, I KNOW.

1155
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:34,984
I KIND OF LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD.

1156
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:41,123
GRANDMA, WHY WAS GRANDPA
SO STRICT WITH DAD
AND AUNT CELESTE?

1157
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:43,292
HE THOUGHT HE WAS
DOING THE RIGHT THING,

1158
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,761
YOU KNOW, BY NOT
SHOWING TOO MUCH EMOTION--

1159
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,031
PREPARING HIS CHILDREN
FOR A LIFE OF LIMITED HOPES

1160
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,300
AND OPPORTUNITIES.

1161
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,803
BUT YOUR FATHER
AND AUNT CELESTE--

1162
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,273
THEY HAD HOPE.

1163
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,844
DID YOU HAVE HOPE,
GRANDMA?

1164
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,445
AT FIRST
WE BOTH DID.

1165
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:08,384
IN TRUTH,
WE NEVER LIVED THE LIFE
YOUR GRANDFATHER DREAMED OF.

1166
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:12,187
BUT HE ALWAYS TRIED
TO PROVIDE THE THINGS
WE NEEDED.

1167
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,224
I MEAN, EVEN IF
WE DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE SOME
OF THE THINGS WE WANTED,

1168
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,326
WE WERE NEVER POOR.

1169
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:20,529
WE WERE NEVER RICH,
BUT WE WERE NEVER POOR.

1170
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:25,134
AND I ALWAYS LOVED--

1171
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:26,569
GOODNESS.

1172
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:30,239
I HOPE MY TONGUE
HASN'T WORN OUT ITS WELCOME
WITH ALL THIS WAGGING.

1173
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,775
THIS IS SO NICE,

1174
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:36,512
JUST LIKE WHEN YOUR FATHER
USED TO SIT RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

1175
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:39,248
WE'D HAVE LONG TALKS.

1176
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,183
ABOUT WHAT?
[laughs]

1177
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:45,921
I REMEMBER ONCE
HE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE

1178
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:50,459
AND HE-- OH, YEAH,
THAT WAS JUST BEFORE
CELESTE RAN OFF.

1179
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:53,829
HE ASKED ME HOW HE'D KNOW
HE WAS DOING WELL

1180
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,831
AS A GROWN-UP.

1181
01:18:55,831 --> 01:19:00,102
AND I TOLD HIM HE COULD TELL
BY THE LOOK IN HIS FAMILY'S EYE.

1182
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,838
AND WHEN I LOOK
INTO YOUR EYES,

1183
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:06,875
I CAN TELL
HE DID VERY WELL INDEED.

1184
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:10,112
HE DID--
MOST EXCELLENT.

1185
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,246

1186
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,383

1192
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,464

GREAT SHOT, MAGGIE!

1211
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,083
HERE, YOU GOT
YOUR LAST ONE.

1212
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,385
YES!
OH, YEAH, RIGHT!

1213
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:25,087
YEAH!
HERE, MY DEAR.

1214
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,188
OH, MY GOSH,
A FISH.

1215
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:29,558
YOUR VERY OWN GOLDFISH.
THERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.

1216
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,563
HEY, MAGGIE,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1217
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,300
HEY, MAGGIE, WAIT UP.

1218
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,636
I THINK YOU FORGOT SOMEONE.

1219
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,071
I DON'T WANT HIM.

1220
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:43,038
YOU SURE?

1221
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,408
HE NEARLY JUMPED
OUT OF THE BAG AFTER YOU.

1222
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,277
I THINK HE LIKES YOU.

1223
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:51,613
HE'S GONNA DIE
JUST LIKE DADDY.

1224
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,615
IT'S NOT FAIR.

1225
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:58,954
COME ON.

1226
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:04,193
LOOK,
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

1227
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,462
MOMMY'S PARENTS DIED.

1228
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:10,099
I CRIED A LOT.
THEY WERE NICE.

1229
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:14,470
ANYWAY, DADDY TOLD ME
NOT TO BE SAD,

1230
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:18,607
THAT I WAS MADE
OF A PIECE OF THEM

1231
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,944
AND THAT THEY'D ALWAYS
BE PART OF ME.

1232
01:21:21,944 --> 01:21:25,581
AS LONG AS I LIVED,
THEY LIVED.

1233
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,649
IT'S LIKE THIS LITTLE GUY.

1234
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:31,420
HE'S MADE UP
OF A WHOLE CHAIN OF FISH

1235
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:36,225
JUST LIKE ME AND YOU
ARE MADE UP OF A WHOLE CHAIN
OF FAMILY

1236
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,460
WHERE EVERYONE LIVES FOREVER

1237
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,662
IN EACH OTHER.

1238
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:44,466
SO HERE, TAKE HIM.

1239
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,934
TAKE HIM.

1240
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:49,438
COME ON, TAKE HIM.

1241
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:51,273
TAKE HIM!

1242
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,543
GO SHOW MOM.

1243
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:58,547
MOM! MOM!
LOOK WHAT I GOT.

1244
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,676
[Woman]

1245
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:31,246
 CLASS, SETTLE DOWN, PLEASE.

1246
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:46,695
[Telegram]
 I HATE THOSE STUPID
 PECKERWOODS.

1247
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,636
[Bruce]
 BE SURE WHEN YOU RALPH,

1248
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,573
 YOU DON'T JUST RALPH
 ON THE GROUND;
 RALPH ON BECK.

1249
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:10,285
[Mary Lou]
 WHAT A DOOFUS.

1250
01:23:19,795 --> 01:23:23,398
[Man]
OKAY, WHO'S GOING TO BE
THE LUCKY PANCAKE PERSON?

1251
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:25,500

ONE MORE PERSON.

1252
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,337

PANCAKE-EATING CONTEST.

1254
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,208
THE WHAT?

1255
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,611
THE FIRST PERSON
WHO FINISHES ALL THE PANCAKES

1256
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:38,146
WINS $100.
I DON'T THINK SO.

1257
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,682
OH, COME ON, COME ON.
GIVE IT A TRY. YOU CAN DO IT.

1258
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,252
NO ONE'S EVER BEAT
OUR CHAMPION DENNIS BECK.

1259
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:51,260
HEY, GIVE HIM
A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
THERE MAYBE, HUH?

1260
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:53,128
HA HA HA!
HEY, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

1261
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,763
COME ON UP HERE.
WAY TO GO, WAY TO GO.

1262
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:59,234
SIT RIGHT DOWN THERE
AND PUT THAT #8 CONTESTANT
BIB RIGHT ON HIM.

1263
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:03,639
OKAY, WELL, LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE READY TO ROLL.

1264
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:07,309
OH, MY GOD, IT'S CLAY.

1265
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,578
ALL THE CONTESTANTS HAVE TO--

1266
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:12,648

1273
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,369
OH, IT'S LOOKING GOOD.
THE COMPETITION IS LOOKING

1274
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,705

GO GO GO!

1281
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:52,621
OH, GOOD LORD,
HE'S GOING TO PASS OUT.

1282
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:56,425
IT'S NOT LIKE HIM TO DO THIS.
IT REALLY ISN'T.

1283
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,527
COMPETITION
BUILDS CHARACTER.

1284
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,797
EAT, BOY! EAT.

1285
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,935

[Barker]
YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN, CHAMP.
YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN.

1287
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:12,541
GO ON, BOY.

1288
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,310

MY SON IS MADE OF.

1289
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,346

[Female barker]
GUESS YOUR WEIGHT!

1294
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,227
COME ON OVER HERE
AND GUESS YOUR WEIGHT.

1295
01:26:05,227 --> 01:26:07,629
COME ON NOW,
GIVE IT A TRY.

1296
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:13,969
THERE YOU GO, BOY.
THANKS.

1297
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:15,604
MM-HMM.

1298
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,609
YOU CALLED ME YOUR SON.

1299
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:23,745
YEAH, WELL,
I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, BOY.

1300
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,815
YOU BEAT THAT BLOWHARD BECK.

1301
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:28,817
[laughs]

1302
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:31,820
YOUR FATHER-- HE NEVER DID
LIKE THAT-- THAT S.O.B.

1303
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:35,490
DID YOU EVER TELL MY DAD
THAT YOU WERE PROUD OF HIM?

1304
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:36,725
HUH?

1305
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:39,428
OH, NO NO NO,
DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1306
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:40,896
HE ALWAYS KNEW.

1307
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,531
HOW?

1308
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,299
WAS HE SUPPOSED TO GUESS?

1309
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,034
WHAT IS THIS,
THE SPANISH INQUISITION
OR SOMETHING?

1310
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,836
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HIM, GRANDPA.

1311
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:50,272
WHAT?

1312
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:56,478
LOOK, BOY,

1313
01:26:56,478 --> 01:27:00,282
I WORKED HARD
TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY.

1314
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:02,951
YOUR FATHER AND THAT--
THAT AUNT CELESTE--

1315
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:05,921
ALL THEY WANTED TO DO
WAS HAVE FUN, YOU KNOW?
LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS.

1316
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:07,556
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THAT?

1317
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,759
I WANTED TO
MAKE SURE HE TOOK CARE
OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES.

1318
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,994
I WAS SCARED HE WOULDN'T
BE PREPARED FOR THIS WORLD,

1319
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,564
A WORLD THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM;
A WORLD THAT DIDN'T WANT ME.

1320
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:24,940
I MUST ADMIT, THOUGH,
HE DID GET SOME GOOD GRADES.

1321
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,778
HE KEPT MOUTHING OFF
IN CLASS.

1322
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:33,982
HE HAD THEM MISFIT FRIENDS.

1323
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:37,519
HE COULDN'T DO NOTHING
WITH HIS HANDS.

1324
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:40,355
HE'D TRY MY PATIENCE SOMETIMES,
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'D GET HOME,
YOU KNOW?

1325
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:42,357
I WAS TIRED FROM WORK.
AND THEN I'D--

1326
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:44,359
HIT HIM?

1327
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:47,662
NO NO NO NO NO,
I NEVER LAID A HAND ON HIM--

1328
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,664
NEVER.

1329
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:54,035
I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING,
THOUGH.

1330
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,771
HE WASN'T SCARED.
HE NEVER WOULD BACK DOWN.

1331
01:27:56,771 --> 01:28:00,342
ONE DAY HE WALKED PAST
MY RAISED HAND

1332
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:02,677
INTO ADULTHOOD...

1333
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,486
NOW HE'S GONE FOREVER.

1334
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:26,868
I GUESS I--

1335
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:29,871
I GUESS I WASN'T MUCH
OF A SUCCESSFUL FATHER.

1336
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,377
WELL, MAYBE YOU WERE
AFTER ALL, GRANDPA.

1337
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:39,381
BECAUSE WHEN DAD GOT SICK,

1338
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:42,517
HE REFUSED TO BE SCARED.

1339
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:44,820
HE DIDN'T BACK DOWN.

1340
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:51,993
AH, HE WAS JUST
TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

1341
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,864
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD
OF HIM, GRANDPA-- VERY PROUD.

1342
01:28:57,465 --> 01:29:01,603
THIS WAS A PICTURE OF HIM
AT HIS GRADUATION.

1343
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:06,908
HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS.

1344
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:12,447
I WAS SO PROUD OF HIM
I COULD BURST.

1345
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,886
HERE.

1346
01:29:17,886 --> 01:29:19,955
YOU TAKE IT.

1347
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,759
BUT YOU NEVER TOLD HIM.

1348
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,062
NO.

1349
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:31,099
I'M TELLING YOU.

1350
01:29:42,444 --> 01:29:44,913
I LOVED THAT BOY SO MUCH.

1351
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,123
DAD GAVE ME A MESSAGE
FOR YOU, GRANDPA.

1352
01:29:56,658 --> 01:30:00,829
HE MADE ME PROMISE
TO TELL YOU--

1353
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:02,998
TO TELL YOU
THAT HE LOVED YOU.

1354
01:30:10,972 --> 01:30:13,241
LISTEN UP, GUYS,
WE'RE REAL CLOSE.

1355
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,577
POSTCARD'S IN THE GARAGE.

1356
01:30:15,577 --> 01:30:17,779
TAKE ME
TO THE POSTCARD.

1357
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:30,558
MMM.

1358
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,833
WHAT THE--

1359
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:42,003
I GUESS WE'RE BACK.

1360
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:02,157
DAD, I FOUND IT!

1361
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:05,960
YES!

1362
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:10,532
[Richard's voice]
 25th OCTOBER, 1944.

1363
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:12,534
 LATE-DAY GOLF.

1364
01:31:12,534 --> 01:31:16,204
 DEAREST GINNY,
 AFTER THE WAR, MARRY ME.

1365
01:31:16,204 --> 01:31:18,707
 OUR LIFE WILL BE MADE
 IN HEAVEN.

1366
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:20,775
 LOVE, RICHIE.

1367
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,513
YES.

1368
01:31:45,033 --> 01:31:48,503
COME ON, MICK,
LET'S GO HOME.

1369
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,815
MMM!

1370
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:19,134
DAD, I JUST CAN'T FIND IT--

1371
01:32:31,813 --> 01:32:33,815
YES!

1372
01:32:45,627 --> 01:32:47,629
[knock on door]

1373
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,764
YEAH?

1374
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,902
HI, HONEY.
CAN I COME IN?

1375
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:55,637
SURE.

1376
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:02,143
BOY, DAD LEFT A LOT
OF MEMORIES IN THIS ROOM.

1377
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:06,981
[laughs]

1378
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,318
HE WON THIS
ON OUR FIRST DATE.

1379
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:13,855
HOW DID YOU AND DAD MEET?

1380
01:33:13,855 --> 01:33:18,426
OH, MY, I HAVEN'T TOLD
THAT STORY IN A LONG TIME.

1381
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:22,897
UM, WE WERE IN
THE SAME PSYCHOLOGY CLASS.

1382
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:27,268
AND I WOULD SAY
FOR THAT WHOLE FIRST SEMESTER,
I NEVER EVEN NOTICED HIM.

1383
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,004
THEN ONE DAY,
ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE OUR FINAL,

1384
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:32,740
I GOT THIS POSTCARD
IN THE MAIL.

1385
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,143
YOUR FATHER
HAD A THING FOR POSTCARDS.

1386
01:33:35,143 --> 01:33:38,246
AND IT SAID,
"I'D LIKE TO GO OUT WITH YOU."

1387
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:43,151
AND IT WAS SIGNED,
"ROW 4, SEAT 17."

1388
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:47,355
SO THE NEXT DAY,
I TOOK SPECIAL NOTICE
OF WHAT WAS SITTING THERE.

1389
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:50,191
AND AT THE END OF CLASS,

1390
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:53,161
I GAVE HIM A PIECE OF PAPER
WITH MY PHONE NUMBER ON IT.

1391
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:57,332
YOU KNOW AT THAT MOMENT,
MY LIFE CHANGED FOREVER.

1392
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:08,109
MY LIFE CHANGED AGAIN

1393
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,845
THE DAY THE DOCTOR
TOLD US HE WAS SICK.

1394
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:14,215
DECEMBER THE 20th,
THAT WAS THE DATE.

1395
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:17,218
AND EVERYBODY WAS FEELING
GOOD ABOUT CHRISTMAS

1396
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:20,255
AND ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

1397
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:22,423
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL.

1398
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:25,793
NO, I DO.
I DO.

1399
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:32,000
YOUR FATHER
FOUGHT THE CANCER THE WAY
HE FOUGHT EVERYTHING,

1400
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,269
LIKE HE COULDN'T THINK
OF NOT WINNING.

1401
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:36,137
BUT THE RADIATION
WASN'T WORKING

1402
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:39,874
AND THE CHEMO JUST TURNED
HIS BODY INTO A BATTLEFIELD.

1403
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:41,342
THE PAIN WAS ALWAYS THERE.

1404
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,746
SO WE FOUND A DOCTOR
WHO PUT HIM ON A SPECIAL PROGRAM

1405
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:48,483
OF VITAMINS, HERBS,
ACUPUNCTURE,

1406
01:34:48,483 --> 01:34:50,818
VISUALIZATION.

1407
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,154
AND IT WORKED FOR HIM...

1408
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:55,924
FOR US.

1409
01:34:58,326 --> 01:35:01,696
SO CLAY,
PLEASE DON'T BLAME ME.

1410
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:06,801
I DON'T.

1411
01:35:12,507 --> 01:35:16,210
TWO DAYS BEFORE HE DIED,
I GOT ANOTHER POSTCARD
IN THE MAIL.

1412
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,214
IT SAID,
"I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

1413
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,450
TAKE YOUR TIME.

1414
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,452
TAKE A LIFETIME."

1415
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:28,456
AND IT WAS SIGNED,

1416
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:32,760
"ETERNALLY,
ROW 4, SEAT 17."

1417
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:39,367
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY--
I HAVE NO REGRETS
WHATSOEVER,

1418
01:35:39,367 --> 01:35:41,402
EXCEPT FOR ONE--

1419
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,807
I REALLY WISH
YOU'D HAD MORE TIME WITH HIM.

1420
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,929
I HAD FUN
AT THE CARNIVAL.

1421
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,397

1422
01:36:09,397 --> 01:36:11,933

LIKED PANCAKES SO MUCH.
