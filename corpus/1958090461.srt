Whoo!

8
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,217
- We pray in the
Temple of the Low God.

9
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,601
- You okay, Cap?

10
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,839
- Yeah.

11
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,274
Yeah, I just dozed off.

12
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:28,650
- Jesus, Hudson,
are you serious?

13
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,251
Nobody wants to see that
shit, put on a towel.

14
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,220
- What?
They need to breathe.

15
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,288
- You got a Tic Tac
sitting on two acorns, man.

16
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,658
- Fuck you,

17
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:38,191
are you feeling a little
jealous right now?

18
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,560
- You know what?

19
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,327
I'll get you a
pump for Christmas.

20
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,667
- Give it up for Cap!

21
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,681
- Speech,
speech, speech, speech.

22
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,415
- I don't give speeches
in my underwear.

23
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,350
- Oh, that's never
stopped you before.

24
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,390
You know, three young women
are at home with their family

25
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,292
because of the Cap today.

26
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,696
- It could have been four if
I had called it in sooner,

27
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:20,802
if I had stopped him before...
- You did stop him, all right?

28
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:24,271
Come on, Cap.
- Yeah. Take the win.

29
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,609
- Look, you gotta
take them somewhere

30
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,713
'cause you are dog shit
at basketball, all right?

31
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,847
- I'll see you tomorrow.

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,816
- I'll see you tomorrow, Cap.

33
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,717
- Get dressed pumpkin.

34
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:21,596
- O'Brien!

35
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,066
- What the fuck do you want?
- You still mad at me?

36
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,067
- Yeah, I'm fucking mad at you.

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,902
- Come on.

38
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,337
Look, that's never happened
to me before, I swear.

39
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,506
Look, I drank too much.

40
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,406
- I've got one rule,

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,976
I don't fuck dudes that
can't drink as much as me.

42
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,744
And you fucking snore.

43
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,046

47

and walk to me, now!

00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:09,944

Diane that I'm sorry.

I never thought I'd be
wearing this uniform,

66
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:52,113
but now it looks
good, don't you think?

67
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,484
Okay, see you later.

68
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,423
Jesus, Diane, what do you want?

69
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,726
- How about you
answer your phone?

70
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,861
- Why?

71
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,729
Nothing's changed, you're drunk,

72
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,665
and I'm still gonna be a
cop, am I missing something?

73
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,001
- I'm not drunk.
- Okay.

74
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,444
- Your father used to spend so
much damn time on these toys.

75
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,648
I used to fucking hate them,

76
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:29,650
but now I can't seem
to throw them away.

77
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,719
This was his favorite.

78
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:34,922
- Diane...

79
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,063
Okay, this was nice,
I'll see you later.

80
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,698
- Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

81
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,566
Baby, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry! I'm sorry.

82
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,001
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Diane, stop, stop, okay?

83
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,602
- Look, you don't
have to do this.

84
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,037
- Why can't you just
be happy for me?

85
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,605
- This isn't you,
you're acting crazy.

86
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,207
- Oh, this is from the woman

87
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,876
who broke my guidance
counselor's arm?

88
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,511
- You don't know what happened.

89
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:58,913
- That's
what you always say.

90
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,514
- Well, you don't.
- Well, then tell me.

91
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,985
No? Nothing?

92
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,619
Because my father's
in the ground

93
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,721
and I can't seem to
make sense of it.

94
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,126
You may not care, but I
need to know what happened.

95
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,030
- I care, but your
father was no saint.

96
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:16,998
- No, he wasn't.

97
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,967
He's everything you weren't.

98
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:24,605

113
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,132
- How long have you been here?

114
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,034
- I just walked in.

115
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,237
I'm... I'm Officer...

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,137

117
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,940
- I requested this shift.

118
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,408
- I said turn around.

119
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,044
Stop!

120
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,952
I said turn around,
not walk away.

121
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,289
- Sir.

122
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,328
I went by the new station,

123
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,330
it looks like they
got their hands full.

124
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,167
- You talking about those
assholes singing on the steps?

125
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,836
Yeah, it's been a year

126
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,038
since we took out that
farm cult pig fucker,

127
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,207
and his loons have managed
to escape jail time

128
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,042
showing their disappointment

129
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,379
with a glorified temper tantrum,
bussing in from all over.

130
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,881
This way, rookie.

131
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,189
You get any curb
creatures doing walk ups,

132
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,858
send them to the new station.

133
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,328
The calls have been rerouted
so it should be quiet

134
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,264
but there's the emergency and
station's numbers on the desk.

135
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,369
My cell, Officer Grip Cohen,

136
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:24,471
but do not mistake
my willingness

137
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,907
to leave my personal number

138
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,410
as an open invitation
for some girl talk.

139
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,045
You understand?

140
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,479
- Yes, sir. I'm
sure I'll be fine.

141
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,482
- You say you volunteered
for this shift?

142
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:36,618
- Yes, sir.

143
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,952
- So what is this? You mental?

144
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,354
- No, sir.

145
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,889
I just wanna work
where my father worked

146
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,924
even if it's for one night.

147
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,459
- What'd you say your name was?

148
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,994
- Officer Jessica Loren.

149
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,963
- You're Will Loren's kid?

150
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:50,864
- Yes, sir.

151
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,869
- You ever see a man die?

152
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,640
- Excuse me, sir.

153
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:02,976
- You know, stare into his
eyes as the light fades.

154
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,214
That get you off?

155
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:08,616
- Do you have a problem with me?

156
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,150
- That depends.
- On what?

157
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,553
- It depends on whether or not

158
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,555
you're as fucked in the
head as your father.

159
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:16,023
- My father was the best
person I've ever known.

160
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,093
- Your father was a murderer.

161
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:22,296
He killed my friends
then ate his shotgun.

162
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,332
So again, why are you here?

163
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,234
Because I can't come up
with a logical reason

164
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,470
why you would
request this shift.

165
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:32,005
- I'm not here to excuse
it, I'm just here to work.

166
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,241
So, can I please work?

167
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,212
- If I cared anymore,

168
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,182
I'd call the chief and have
you booted, but I don't.

169
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:48,922
Stay out of holding.

170
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:56,964
- Asshole.

171
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,625
Hello?

172
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,226
Officer Cohen?

173
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,510
Officer Cohen?

174
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:39,721
Sir, are you okay?

175
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,124
- No, I can't. Don't
you think I've looked?

176
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,393
- Sir, do you need
me to help you?

177
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,294
- No!

178
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,598
Where's my baby?

179
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,768
Where's my girl?

180
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,571
Where did you go?

181
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,507
Why did you leave?

182
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,745
- Let me help you, okay?
Let me call a shelter.

183
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,486
Oh, fuck.

184
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,189
Seriously?

185
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,550
Lanford Police Department.

186
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,853
Hello.

187
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:19,620
Hello, little piggy.

188
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:30,898
- Lanford Police Department.

189
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,767
- Did you know
that the little piggy

190
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,368
that went to the market didn't
go there to buy groceries?

191
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,972
She went there to be groceries.

192
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,640
She was slaughtered.

193
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:41,042
- Look, I don't have
time for this shit.

194
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,977
Prank calling a police
station is illegal

195
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,278
and I can have you arrested,
consider this your warning.

196
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,981
- Slaughtered
in cold blood

197
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:49,382
like the piggies at
your station.

198
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,319
- Who is this?

199
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,425
- Lanford
Police Department.

200
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,427
- This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

201
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,963
I'm calling because I
received a prank call

202
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,698
that needs to be traced.

203
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,298
- I'm
sorry, who's this?

204
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,701
- Officer Loren.

205
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:08,903
- Any
relation to Will Loren?

206
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,772
- Yes, he was my father.

207
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:11,939
- I'm
sorry to hear that.

208
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:13,574
- Excuse me?

209
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:14,575
- We got a
lot going on over here

210
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,043
and tracing prank calls

211
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,377
is not at the top
of our priorities.

212
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,046
- Hello?

213
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,903
- Come on,
you're safe now.

214
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,437
We're here to help, come on,
we'll get you home, girls.

215
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,140
Don't worry.

216
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,661
- Get down
motherfucker, don't you move.

217
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,996
You are fucking dead!

218
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:22,069
- We pray in the
Temple of the Low God.

219
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:27,008
- Please, if anyone's
got any information,

220
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,745
I just want my daughter
back home safe.

221
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,745
- Lanford
Police Department.

222
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,681
- This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

223
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,150
- Officer
Loren, more prank calls?

224
00:24:09,183 --> 00:24:11,652
- No, there's a huge
pig tied up outside.

225
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:14,121
- Well,
you don't hear that every day.

226
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:15,890
- Well, what should
I do with it?

227
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:17,158
- Nothing.

228
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,093
- Just leave it there?

229
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,695
- It's probably
safer if you stay inside.

230
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,096
- Mm, yeah, why?
'Cause I'm a woman?

231
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,698
- No officer,

232
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,533
I don't know if you
noticed on your way in,

233
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:27,902
but we had some assholes
causing bullshit on our steps,

234
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,637
well, now they're
doing it all over town

235
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,505
and we're spread a little thin.

236
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,107
So, if they left that
future bacon on your lawn

237
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,010
and something were to
happen, I can't send back up.

238
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:38,279
Whether or not you have tits
got nothing to do with it.

239
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,180
- Fine.

240
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:42,883
- Look, I'm sorry.

241
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,218
There's a lot going on here

242
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,987
and you're the
closest punching bag.

243
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,657
Leave the pig, we'll
get to it later.

244
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,185
- This is Officer Loren
at the old station

245
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:01,222
investigating a B&E
possible code nine.

246
00:28:10,324 --> 00:28:12,226
Sir, get to the ground.

247
00:28:24,805 --> 00:28:25,806
- I don't know...

248
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:39,753
But I can't remember.
I can't remember.

249
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:49,463
Where is she?

250
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,337
- Roll over on your stomach.

251
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,373
Roll over.

252
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,214
Hands behind your back.

253
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,506
Step inside.

254
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,441
- She's here.
- Move.

255
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:09,877
- My baby.

256
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:14,114
- I said move.
- No!

257
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:17,851
She's here.

258
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:18,819
She's here.

259
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:21,822
She's here. She's here!

260
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,396
No, no...

261
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:35,035
She's here. She's here.
- All right, well, let's go.

262
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,236
- Shut up! No, no!

263
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,407
No!
- Fuck. Come on.

264
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,410
- No! She's here.

265
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:47,114
- Shit, hey, no, no, no.

266
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,254
Fuck! Okay...

267
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,962
Dispatch, this is Officer
Loren at the old station.

268
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,575
Officer Loren at the old
station in need of assistance.

269
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,410
- Still here.
- Hello?

270
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:21,516
- Still
here. Still here.

271
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:24,485
- You tell her.

272
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,488
No, you tell her.

273
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,492
You tell her.

274
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:35,129
Daddy didn't do it,
daddy didn't do it.

275
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,263
Daddy didn't..

276
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,638
Let me out, let me out.

277
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:48,275
She's
here, she's hear.

278
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,718
My baby never came home!

279
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:26,714
- Sir, give me the flashlight.

280
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:34,354
Please don't make me shoot
someone on my first day.

281
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:50,304
Still here, still here.

282
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:54,709
- Let me out!
- Still here, Jessica.

283
00:32:58,713 --> 00:32:59,581
- Dad?

284
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:04,752
- Still here, still here,
still here, still here.

285
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,150
- I will maintain courageous
calm in the face of danger,

286
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,254
scorn, or ridicule,
develop self restraint,

287
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:44,759
and be constantly mindful of
the wellbeing of others...

288
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,061
The welfare of others.

289
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:52,099
I will be exemplary
in obeying the laws

290
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,034
and the regulations
of my department.

291
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,305
- Hello?

292
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,140
Hello!

293
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:38,278
- This is Officer Loren,
sorry to call you so late.

294
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,346
- What is it?

295
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:45,185
Your "um" better be followed
by the building is on fire

296
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:46,721
or worse to be
calling at this hour.

297
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:48,590
- When I first arrived
at the station,

298
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:51,425
you were yelling at something,
I was curious what it was.

299
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,228
- You were curious
and saw fit to wake me up

300
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:56,631
in the middle of the night?

301
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,533
- Yes, did did
you see something?

302
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,802
- Right now, I see you
can't handle a simple shift.

303
00:35:00,835 --> 00:35:02,704
You're gonna have to be more-

304
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,572
- Did you see something
that wasn't really there?

305
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,709
- Damn it, did
you go into holding?

306
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,145
- Well, I didn't have a choice.

307
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,481
A homeless man broke
into the station, I...

308
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,618
- Holding is covered
in black mold little girl,

309
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,786
the shit is toxic,
makes you hallucinate.

310
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:22,422
- But I was seeing
things before...

311
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,323
- I told
you stay out of it.

312
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:24,759
- But sir, I-

313
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:25,760
- You don't
care to follow orders-

314
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,595
- Yes I do, sir, I do.

315
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:29,329
- I'll call the station,
have them send over a unit

316
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,765
to pick up that
bum piece of shit.

317
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:32,900
- No sir, You don't
understand, I was-

318
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:34,569
- You need
me to come over there

319
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,203
and hold your hand
like a little baby

320
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,672
or you gonna shut the
fuck up and do your job?

321
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,208
- I will do my job.

322
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,176
- And?

323
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,213
- And I will shut the fuck up.

324
00:35:47,548 --> 00:35:49,149
- Good,
don't call me again.

325
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:46,601
- Get out of...

326
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:49,804
- Motherfucker, fuck you.
- Hey!

327
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:53,440
Fuck you, fucking asshole!

328
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:54,742
- You all right?

329
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:08,556
- What?

330
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:11,058
- This your first day?
- Yeah.

331
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:12,860
- I figured.

332
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,062
No seasoned cop would
clean me up like this.

333
00:38:17,832 --> 00:38:19,600
My daddy was a cop.
- Really?

334
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:23,403
Now you?

335
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:26,707
- I trick to pay the
bills, it's not my job.

336
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:27,675
- What's your job?

337
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:30,845
- I work in sanitation.

338
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:35,850
Some of these fuckers,
they like to go after kids.

339
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,021
Especially at the truck stops.

340
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:42,857
Happens more than you
think, a lot more.

341
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,727
So when I see it happen,
I take out the trash.

342
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:55,803
- So, you do what to them?

343
00:38:58,873 --> 00:38:59,740
Hey.

344
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,512
Hey. You there?

345
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,113
- Just drifted
there for a moment.

346
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,584
You here alone.
- Why?

347
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:12,920
- I wouldn't wanna be here
alone, not after what happened.

348
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:14,589
- With the officers?

349
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:16,023
- Well, I don't know
nothing about that.

350
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:18,092
I mean, what happened
with the mountain flock.

351
00:39:19,594 --> 00:39:21,562
I was there that
night in the next cell

352
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:23,531
and they were bragging
about what they'd done.

353
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:27,034
Killed that girl, and it
wasn't the first time either.

354
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:27,735
- What night?

355
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,538
- The night they
hung themselves.

356
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:34,575
- They died in an officer
involved shooting.

357
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,376
- Did you see it happen?
- No.

358
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,648
- I bet my tits and a pack
of cigarettes it's the truth.

359
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,482
I saw it when they
were moving me,

360
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:46,621
had pillowcases over their
heads, blood all over the walls,

361
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:47,788
blood all over the...

362
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:02,703
- What is it?

363
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:06,941
What's wrong?

364
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:13,614
- Not gonna say...
anything else...

365
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:18,418
- What are you looking at?
- Say... anything more...

366
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,021
- Hey!

367
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:25,526
- From the kingdom of our
father, faithful and true,

368
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:29,697
our flock we will
follow devoted in you,

369
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,202
on this day in his arms...

370
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,604
...my soul, I will
bring. For the king...

371
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:40,574
He rejoices, when the dead sing!

372
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:47,615
- Okay, I'm... I'm gonna
call you an ambulance, okay?

373
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,517
Okay?

374
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:11,272
- Sorry, I just drifted
there for a moment.

375
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,240
- I think it's
time for you to go.

376
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:15,609
- Okay, okay, okay.

377
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,611
I just, shit.

378
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,848
You have a tampon
I could borrow?

379
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,783
Can't earn worth a damn
with my guts spilling out.

380
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:24,185
- Get out.
- Okay, okay.

381
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,095
- Lanford Police Department.

382
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:35,730
- Hello, little piggy.

383
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,638
- Lanford Police Department.

384
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:47,008
- Hang up again and I
will fucking kill this girl.

385
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:49,643
You understand?

386
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:51,979
- What girl?

387
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,982
- Oh, I don't know.

388
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:59,186
It's Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe,
catch a hostage by her toe.

389
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,857
Monica Matthews, do
you know that name?

390
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,725
- What kind of game
are you playing?

391
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,827
- Give it a nibble-

392
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:07,728
- Stop!

393
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,664
- Do you know that name?

394
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:14,268
- Yes, she was one of the
girls my father rescued.

395
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:16,037
- There you
go, that's right.

396
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,638
- What do you want?

397
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:19,774
- It's
not me, it's John.

398
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,343
Trust in his-
- John Malum is dead.

399
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:25,813
- Is he? Did you
ever see a tarantula molt?

400
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:28,816
Shed the dead baby.
Shed the dead.

401
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:29,884
- Let me talk to her.

402
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,622
- Your daddy started
something very important,

403
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:36,257
tonight, we're gonna finish it.

404
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,626
Hello?

405
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,767
- Lanford
Police Department.

406
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:47,902
- They kidnapped
Monica Matthews again.

407
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,303
- Who did what?

408
00:42:49,336 --> 00:42:50,237
- The flock, they...
- Hold the line.

409
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:55,910
Officer, did they
mention anyone else?

410
00:42:55,943 --> 00:43:00,948
- No, well, she
mentioned my father.

411
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:03,617
- So, she
knows who you are?

412
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,219
- She said he started something

413
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,887
that they would finish tonight.

414
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:10,057
- Listen, I
shouldn't tell you this,

415
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:14,328
but Monica Matthews disappeared
from a party tonight.

416
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:18,632
Two other girls also
gone missing, Julie
Sims and Anna Cole.

417
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:21,102
All three girls your
father rescued a year ago.

418
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:26,107
Look, I'll reach out
to the phone company

419
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,308
and find out where the
call's coming from.

420
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:28,375
You stay by the line.

421
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,058
- What did you start, Dad?

422
00:44:09,116 --> 00:44:12,019
- Oh, don't cry little lamb,

423
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:15,923
your body will rot
like so many before,

424
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:19,260
but your spirit
will feed the demon.

425
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,164
You'll make it strong
for its long journey.

426
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:24,798
Oh, I hear can whispers,

427
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:27,201
they're saying I'm
gonna be the queen.

428
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:29,904
- Oh, you can't hear shit.
- Ow!

429
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:31,839
- Please, please don't do this.

430
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,708
I can hear them too,
is that what you want?

431
00:44:34,742 --> 00:44:36,744
I can hear the whispers.

432
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:47,888
- She don't even look
like people anymore.

433
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:13,480
Hello?

434
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,817
- I know you
think I let you down,

435
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,121
but I was a good mother
when it mattered most.

436
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,790
- I can't do this right now.

437
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,893
- Your father
didn't want this for you.

438
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,128
- Seriously, I can't.

439
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,964
- I'm fucking weak!
- Jesus...

440
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:37,771
- Okay, eat something,
go to bed, sober up.

441
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:41,942
Diane.

442
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:43,410
Diane!

443
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:44,778
- What are
you listening to?

444
00:45:44,812 --> 00:45:45,479
- It's nothing.

445
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,983
- Where the
fuck are you right now?

446
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:51,352
- I have to go.
- Turn that shit off.

447
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:53,420
Turn that shit off, off.

448
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:57,191
Turn that shit off.
- Stop.

449
00:45:57,224 --> 00:46:00,562
- Turn them
off, turn it off.

450
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:01,862
- Stop.
- Off!

451
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,867
- Jessica.

452
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:36,116
- Don't go, still here!
- He burns with us, pig!

453
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:59,106
- Oh, come on. Pick up.

454
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,710
- Lanford
Police Department.

455
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:04,178
- They chained the doors.

456
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,580
- They chained what?

457
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:08,115
- I'm locked in, I'm
fucking trapped in here.

458
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:10,017
- You're
gonna be okay,

459
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,085
I'll get a unit over there
ASAP with some bolt cutters.

460
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,987
- Oh, they better come quick

461
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,456
or I'm gonna shoot a
fucking window out.

462
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,191
- They'll
be there, I promise.

463
00:49:17,224 --> 00:49:21,195
But right now, I need
you to calm down.

464
00:49:21,228 --> 00:49:24,231
- Did John Malum die in here?

465
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,601
- Look,
I wasn't there.

466
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:31,405
I've heard rumors, but
what's the difference?

467
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,306
He's dead.

468
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,110
- I can't, I can't do this.

469
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:43,217
I can't do this, I thought
I could, but I can't.

470
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,154
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

471
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:52,259
I can't do this
any more, please...

472
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,630
Please, can't you
just get me out?

473
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,632
- Officer,
listen, look,

474
00:49:57,665 --> 00:49:59,634
I need you there right now

475
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:02,770
because there are three girls
missing and you can help.

476
00:50:02,804 --> 00:50:04,438
- I just wanna get out.

477
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:06,373
- This psycho
is only calling you

478
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:09,209
because she knows
you're Will Loren's kid,

479
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:13,380
that everybody thinks your
father's a piece of shit,

480
00:50:13,413 --> 00:50:17,050
except for those three
girls and their families.

481
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,520
Don't let that be undone.

482
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:24,792
The calls are coming
from a burner,

483
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,226
we're gonna try
to get a location,

484
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,228
but if she calls you again,

485
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:29,731
get whatever you can
out of her, okay?

486
00:50:29,764 --> 00:50:32,567
Things are escalating,
they're starting fires.

487
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,368
So, if you smell smoke,

488
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,737
then you can use your firearm
to shoot out a window.

489
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,437
But right now, I need you there.

490
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:40,140
- Okay.

491
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,776
- Shit, I
gotta go, sit tight,

492
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:43,410
help will be there soon.

493
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,145
You picked one hell
of a first shift.

494
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:57,625
- I will maintain courageous
calm in the face of danger.

495
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:01,461
To have self restraint,
be constantly mindful

496
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,499
of the welfare of others.

497
00:51:31,593 --> 00:51:34,596
Hello?

498
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:57,685
♪ And he will come home ♪

499
00:52:14,636 --> 00:52:19,607
♪ Carved of its skin,
and devoured to bone ♪

500
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:25,546
♪ Call him from the depths
and he will come home ♪

501
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,647
- It's good to see
you again, Will.

502
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,682
- Shut the fuck up.

503
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,919
- I'm gonna come back
for you and all you love.

504
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,689
Mark my words.

505
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,657
- We pray in the
Temple of the Low God.

506
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:12,960
John is... John is its vessel.

507
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:16,631
Trust in his plan for
you have purpose too.

508
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:21,536
- You've seen things you
can't begin to explain.

509
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,437
- We pray in the temple
of the low God...

510
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,873
- And now my words have
threatened your family.

511
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:27,775
- Trust in his plan.
- You must know

512
00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:30,812
if you should pull out your
gun, blow my brains out...

513
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:32,580
For you have purpose too.

514
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,982
- Satan and Christ.

515
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,618
- My father was a minister.
My father was a minister.

516
00:53:37,652 --> 00:53:39,587
My mother a mortuary beautician.

517
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,589
- Just fictions of the church.

518
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:44,826
- She painted
cadavers like clowns.

519
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:47,929
When she died, we
had a closed casket.

520
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:51,298
- Did you know that, Will,
you are important in all this?

521
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,734
In your own little way.

522
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,635
- You smell like egg
covered cat piss.

523
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:57,304
See, my paw was drenched in
it, and it don't go away.

524
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:58,673
Gotta cut it out.

525
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:00,474
- I was never abused
or mistreated.

526
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:01,642
My childhood was pleasant.

527
00:54:01,676 --> 00:54:03,477
- So, I chopped off his balls

528
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:04,679
and shoved 'em right
down his throat.

529
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:07,414
- Trust in his plan.

530
00:54:07,447 --> 00:54:10,017
- Wibble-wobble,
wibble-wobble, squish, squish.

531
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:11,619
- You have a purpose too.

532
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:13,353
You have purpose too.
- Squish, squish.

533
00:54:14,655 --> 00:54:16,791
- We pray in the
Temple of the Low God.

534
00:54:16,824 --> 00:54:18,659
- The devil on my shoulder

535
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:23,998
just isn't what you think it is.

536
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:28,002
- My mother wrote me a lullaby,

537
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:29,704
words were pure and true.

538
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:32,507
The song of the Low God,
now it's here for you.

539
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,943
My mother wrote me a lullaby,
her words were pure and true,

540
00:54:35,977 --> 00:54:38,311
the song of the Low God,
and now it's here for you.

541
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:46,521
- The devil on my shoulder just
isn't what you think it is.

542
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,492
- What are you looking at?

543
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,700
- I'm gonna come back
for you and all you love.

544
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:08,876
The devil on my shoulder just
isn't what you think it is.

545
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:13,714
Lullaby, her words
were pure and true.

546
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:15,448
The song of the Low God!

547
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:19,020
And now it's here for you!

548
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:30,958
Help, help!

549
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:33,060
- No! Oh!

550
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,645
- Hello? Anybody here?

551
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:39,126
Whoa, easy rookie.

552
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,562
I called out but I
didn't hear an answer.

553
00:57:41,595 --> 00:57:42,930
There you go.
- Sorry.

554
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,532
- You okay?
- Do I look okay?

555
00:57:44,565 --> 00:57:46,867
- You look stressed.
- Yeah, I guess.

556
00:57:46,901 --> 00:57:47,768
- I'm Price.

557
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,005
- I clipped the last one.

558
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:55,076
- This fat, pathetic
fuck is Hudson.

559
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:56,877
Unfortunately, he's my partner.

560
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:59,046
- I asked you not
to call me that. Hi.

561
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:01,849
- Look, we're here for
the guy in holding.

562
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:02,750
- Great.

563
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:05,186
- You got the keys?
- Yeah, yeah.

564
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:08,823
- Whoa, whoa, why
am I grabbing him?

565
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:10,858
- Because you need
to exercise, asshole.

566
00:58:12,626 --> 00:58:14,996
- Fuck you,
I'm going in there.

567
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,264
- You're going in there.
- You're going in there.

568
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:19,700
- Okay, just give us a sec.

569
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,778
- Fine.

570
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:34,682
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot.

571
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,851
Fuck! I'll be back.

572
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,021
- Unfortunately, he's
not much to look at,

573
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,989
but he's phenomenal in
bed, so I'll give him that.

574
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:44,925
They told us Captain
Loren's daughter

575
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,028
would be joining the department.

576
00:58:47,061 --> 00:58:50,097
It's kind of... It's
kind of fucked up.

577
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:52,633
Put you in here, it's
kind of funny though.

578
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:53,734
- I wanted to be here.

579
00:58:55,936 --> 00:59:00,574
- Okay. Well he was a hero
till he wasn't, you know,

580
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:02,743
kind of fell off the old rocker.

581
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:03,744
- What happened that day?

582
00:59:06,147 --> 00:59:07,648
- Look, I should probably
go check on Hudson.

583
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:08,849
- I have a right to know.

584
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:12,019
- Okay.

585
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:18,592
If you must know,
it was my fault.

586
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,763
Yeah, he wasn't acting right,

587
00:59:22,797 --> 00:59:25,733
I should have told the
chief, but I didn't.

588
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:28,769
He kept watching
this interrogation
video over and over

589
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:31,872
and over, he said
he saw something.

590
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:35,643
The day before your
father did what he did,

591
00:59:35,676 --> 00:59:39,680
he told me, he said,
"Don't go into holding."

592
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:42,950
John Malum is still here.

593
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:47,988
Which reminds me, I
got something to show
you. Come with me.

594
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:08,075
- Yeah.

595
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,811
We wanted it destroyed with
the rest of the building.

596
01:00:15,082 --> 01:00:16,083
- Is that...

597
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,018
- Yeah.

598
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:22,323
Don't touch it, okay?

599
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:28,762
It stays here.

600
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,772
- We devote ourselves to you

601
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:40,241
as you shall be to us,

602
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:45,312
faithfully, with great
purpose and ritual.

603
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:50,184
The Temple Baron will
bring forth the Low God

604
01:00:51,852 --> 01:00:53,821
and I will be redeemer,

605
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:59,927
king of torment and starless
nights, Infinum Malum.

606
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:08,936
I baptize thee in my blood,

607
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:15,743
bound no more to this
flesh, but to another.

608
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:20,781
You are one of us.

609
01:01:27,955 --> 01:01:30,157
You are one of us, Jessica.

610
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:33,027
She is one of us!

611
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,130
She's one of us, let me out!

612
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,098
Please, she's one of us!

613
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:40,067
Let me out! Let me out!

614
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,369
You have to let me out!

615
01:01:42,403 --> 01:01:44,338
You have to let me out!

616
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,441
Can you hear them?

617
01:01:47,474 --> 01:01:50,010
- She must be present on
the night of his arrival.

618
01:01:51,212 --> 01:01:52,913
She must summon power.

619
01:01:52,947 --> 01:01:55,382
She must devote herself.

620
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:59,753
She must participate for
great purpose and ritual.

621
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:26,046
- Daddy,
I wanna go home.

622
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:27,515
I just wanna go home.

623
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:33,454
I'm in here.

624
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:36,824
- Betty?

625
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:43,264
- Help me, I wanna go home.

626
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:46,333
- You've reached Diane,

627
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:48,902
if I don't care
about you, fuck off.

628
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:50,505
- I'm at the old station
where dad worked,

629
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,206
call me as soon as you get this.

630
01:02:58,212 --> 01:03:00,981
- Shh. It's okay.

631
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,785
That's my little Jessica.

632
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:17,331
It's gonna be okay.

633
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,300
Daddy's gonna find us.

634
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:20,968
You don't know your daddy yet,

635
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,004
but he just became
a police officer.

636
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:29,310
He's got a glove on
his belt and a gun.

637
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:30,878
And when he gets here,

638
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:32,913
he'll beat John until
he stops moving.

639
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:38,919
He'll wanna kill him, but he
won't because he's a good man.

640
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:43,991
But John never forgets,
and he'll find us.

641
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:29,396
- Open
the fucking door.

642
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,534
I thought you were working
at the new station.

643
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:34,501
Why would you be here?
- You lied to me.

644
01:05:34,536 --> 01:05:36,236
- I lied about a lot of shit.

645
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,438
- You wanna narrow that down?

646
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:38,506
You were one of them.

647
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:40,642
- How do you know that?
- Oh shit,

648
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:41,341
it's true, isn't it?

649
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:48,716
- I left your father
after we were pregnant

650
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,350
because John found me.

651
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,153
He just came knocking
on the door and he said,

652
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:56,223
your baby was gonna be
part of something so big.

653
01:05:56,256 --> 01:05:57,224
I believed him.

654
01:05:58,726 --> 01:06:01,428
After you were
born, I saw things

655
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:04,131
and I needed to get you as far
away from them as possible.

656
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:05,567
Your daddy saved us.

657
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,267
We ran, we left
our lives behind,

658
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,169
but a year ago, he found us.

659
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:12,272
John hadn't aged a day,

660
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:15,342
it was like staring
at a bad memory.

661
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,277
He wanted us back, baby.

662
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:22,316
Will stopped him,
but John had plans.

663
01:06:23,116 --> 01:06:24,485
He always does.

664
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:26,453
- What was I meant
to be part of?

665
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:27,354
- Diane.

666
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:33,661
- Answer me, where
are you going? Diane?

667
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,365
- Diane. Diane.

668
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:44,238
- Diane, what are you doing?

669
01:06:54,147 --> 01:06:55,650
Mom.

670
01:06:57,484 --> 01:07:00,220
Lock the door, stay here.

671
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:12,332
This is Officer Loren, I
need fucking backup now.

672
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:23,545
- Please, help me.
- Holster, your pistol.

673
01:07:23,578 --> 01:07:25,212
- Put the gun down.
- Holster,

674
01:07:25,245 --> 01:07:26,748
your fucking pistol.
- Put the gun down.

675
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,482
- Do it or I'll kill her.
- Put it down!

676
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:30,785
- Holster your pistol now!
- Okay, okay.

677
01:07:32,787 --> 01:07:34,589
Where are the other girls?

678
01:07:34,622 --> 01:07:37,525
- It's your night and
that's all you have to ask?

679
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:40,360
You're crazy, just
like your mother.

680
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,296
- Let her go, I already
requested backup.

681
01:07:42,329 --> 01:07:44,732
- Nobody's coming,
you're on your own.

682
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,366
- What do you want?

683
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,538
It's not what I want,
it's what he wants.

684
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:52,205
And he wants you.

685
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,542
- Well, I'm right here
cunt, come and get me.

686
01:07:54,576 --> 01:07:57,411
- Patience piggy,
your time will come.

687
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:59,547
The Low God's been
whispering in John's ear

688
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,716
ever since you were
in your mama's belly.

689
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:04,284
And he knew you would
come back to him.

690
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,287
You know, I'd hoped I'd
be the one by his side.

691
01:08:07,321 --> 01:08:12,192
But I know what I'm here for,
I have a message for you.

692
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:15,462
You see, you need
power for this ritual

693
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:19,567
and there there is
power in spilling blood.

694
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:20,702
- Please.

695
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:21,836
- An animal will give you some.

696
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:23,437
- Don't you fucking touch her.

697
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:24,505
- But a human will
give you more.

698
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:32,714
- I'm gonna get you little
piggy! I'm coming to get you!

699
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,358
- Mom?

700
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:49,664
Mom?

701
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:56,169
Mom!

702
01:09:00,374 --> 01:09:02,677
Hello?
- Good, good, you're okay.

703
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:05,312
Listen, we think the
flock is planning a raid

704
01:09:05,345 --> 01:09:06,914
on the old station.
- They're here.

705
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,415
- Fuck,
fuck, all right,

706
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,416
we'll get you out of there.

707
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,885
Is your mother safe?

708
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:15,355
- I can't find her.
I can't, I can't...

709
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:16,924
How do you know
my mother's here?

710
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:22,262
- Oh, well, I always
keep tabs on her.

711
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:26,233
She was one of my
favorite jewels,

712
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,303
as devoted as they come.

713
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,206
Pure fire.

714
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:35,743
- Who is this?

715
01:09:37,578 --> 01:09:39,914
- I told your
daddy that I'd come back

716
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:41,214
for all he loved.

717
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,819
- Where the fuck is my mother?

718
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:48,723
- A vessel must
be chosen by its passenger.

719
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:52,827
I was chosen when I was a boy

720
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,496
and tonight, the Low
God finally comes.

721
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,652
What are you doing back
here? Where's my mother?

722
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,728
This is officer Loren
at the old station

723
01:11:00,762 --> 01:11:05,332
in need of assistance.

724
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,802
I repeat, officer in need
of fucking assistance.

725
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:13,040

find you, pretty little pig.
