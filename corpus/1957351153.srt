- How old's your boy now?
- 5.

701
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:13,250
That sounds about right.

702
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:21,058
What do you imagine
they're doing right now?

703
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:24,527
You know,
while their daddies talk murder.

704
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,098
I haven't seen her.

705
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,899
I don't, uh...

706
00:37:31,135 --> 00:37:34,839
I don't know what she does.

707
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:37,942
I like to imagine that
she's got a nice dollhouse,

708
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:41,212
but she goes out
riding her bike.

709
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:46,017
But then I also hope
that she's careful, you know?

710
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,620
A lot of dangerous men
in the world.

711
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:53,190
Too many.

712
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:54,992
Do you have a picture?

713
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:05,702
She's beautiful.

714
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,604
She takes after her mother,

715
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:09,306
Have you seen her mother
recently?

716
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,010
Not in a few months.

717
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:19,083
I miss the hell out of them.

718
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,186
- Rosa's getting to that age.
- HAGMAIER: That age?

719
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:26,857
When she understands
what people say about me.

720
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,093
Yeah, well, how do you even
explain that to a child?

721
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:31,295
BUNDY: How do you explain that
to an adult?

722
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:33,663
Full grown adults walk around
that don't understand

723
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,032
that they shouldn't believe

724
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,634
everything that they hear
in the press.

725
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,937
How can you expect
a 4 year old to?

726
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,309
Does your son know what you do?

727
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:48,145
He knows his daddy
protects people.

728
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,850
Well...

729
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,819
Rose's daddy...

730
00:38:56,854 --> 00:38:58,621
well, he doesn't.

731
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,630
Did you get that letter I sent.

732
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:08,833
HAGMAIER: The latest one?

733
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:11,068
Is that the one about the girl

734
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,370
- who sends you the pictures?
- Yeah.

735
00:39:13,404 --> 00:39:15,973
I mean, a lot of women
send photographs.

736
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:17,208
HAGMAIER: Well, not like these.

737
00:39:17,241 --> 00:39:19,110
No.

738
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:20,743
I don't know where you would go

739
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:22,980
to get something
like these developed.

740
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:25,748
The wall of your cell must
be quite a sight to see.

741
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,084
Oh, I don't keep them.

742
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:31,388
No, I trade them
to other inmates for favors,

743
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:33,991
- commissary and the like.
- You don't like them?

744
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,994
I always know there will be more
in the next day's mail.

745
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,340
Turn the tape off.

746
00:39:56,413 --> 00:39:58,282
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

747
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,385
Why not?

748
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:04,355
I... [SIGHS]

749
00:40:04,388 --> 00:40:06,790
You're getting inside my head,

750
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,459
I don't like people
being inside my head.

751
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,461
- I'm not inside your head.
- You're so full of it.

752
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,096
- No...
- I bet you think you know

753
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:14,365
what I would do
if I broke out of this place.

754
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:15,933
- HAGMAIER: I don't.
- Yeah, but you do.

755
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:17,301
I bet you think you do.

756
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,103
Tell me.

757
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,304
Tell me what
you think I would do

758
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,273
if I broke out of this place.

759
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:33,317
Well, the first thing
you would do is steal a car.

760
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:39,924
Then you'd probably head up
to the state of Washington.

761
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:42,860
You'd probably remove
a couple of people

762
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,130
- that are under your skin now.
- Yeah. Who?

763
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:49,767
Maybe a... an investigator

764
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,302
that's pissing you off.

765
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:53,904
Not returning the letters.

766
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:55,806
Maybe a journalist

767
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,875
who's been...

768
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,277
unkind.

769
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:03,280
Then there's somebody else.
I don't know.

770
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,053
A guy you think is
having sex with your wife.

771
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:12,990
Then you'd steal another car,

772
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:14,358
slip over the border
into Canada,

773
00:41:14,391 --> 00:41:16,327
and never, ever come out.

774
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:20,064
We'd never hear from you
ever again.

775
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:21,799
Fuck you!

776
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:24,435
[FOLDER CLATTERS]

777
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:49,827
You can turn the tape back on.

778
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,795
HAGMAIER: A-Are you sure?

779
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,431
I wouldn't know what else
to do with my time.

780
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,103
You could write another book.

781
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:01,038
Oh, never again.

782
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:02,239
That didn't work out.

783
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,807
It was a bestseller

784
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,342
BUNDY:
We did correctly anticipate

785
00:42:05,376 --> 00:42:09,313
the baser desires
of the book-buying public.

786
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:12,283
They do want to be titillated.

787
00:42:12,316 --> 00:42:14,184
There were people who read that
for genuine reasons,

788
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:16,954
- but they were misled.
- How so?

789
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,857
Well, it's a funny thing
when money gets involved,

790
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,427
and people do things for money
that they ordinarily wouldn't.

791
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,829
And those guys, they wanted me
to talk about things

792
00:42:25,863 --> 00:42:27,131
that I was suspected of,

793
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:28,565
and I was like,
"I can't do that.

794
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:31,502
All I can do is speculate."

795
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,304
Anybody who read those books

796
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:35,572
knows nothing about me
or what actually happened.

797
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:37,875
Well, there are other people
who wrote books

798
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:40,377
who knew you before
any alleged criminal activity,

799
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:41,945
and they felt they knew you.

800
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,882
- You mean Ann Rule?
- Do you remember her?

801
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:46,450
Vividly.

802
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:50,087
In her own way,
she's a very nice person.

803
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,023
All we did was share shifts
at call-in crisis center.

804
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:54,558
We never saw each other
socially.

805
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,093
My former fiancee,

806
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:58,062
girlfriend, friend,
what have you, Liz,

807
00:42:58,095 --> 00:42:59,430
she wrote a book about me.

808
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:01,298
She had a far, far
better opportunity

809
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:02,499
to get to know me.

810
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:04,468
Better than Diane Edwards?

811
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:10,274
Diane is a lovely person.

812
00:43:10,307 --> 00:43:12,876
But we were only just friends.

813
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,945
We never lived together.

814
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:18,916
Now, Liz, she saw me day in
and day out for years.

815
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:20,117
Well, Diane is referred to

816
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,652
as someone you cared
very deeply for.

817
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,520
There are a lot
of theories about me

818
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:27,591
that are just
a bunch of bull crap.

819
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:29,426
Well, people think that
Diana and I broke up,

820
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,329
and somehow this was the...

821
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:36,467
traumatic episode in my life
that made me go over the edge.

822
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,902
But...

823
00:43:38,936 --> 00:43:40,604
It's simply not true.

824
00:43:40,637 --> 00:43:43,107
It's completely untrue.
[CHUCKLES]

825
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,378
I know in my heart

826
00:43:47,411 --> 00:43:50,214
that that episode
was not important.

827
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:55,652
Now you have Liz, friends,
family, relatives...

828
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:58,021
they're all reexamining
our relationships.

829
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:01,125
You know, they're...

830
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:02,659
"Did I see it coming?
Could I have stopped it?"

831
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:04,128
You know how it is.

832
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:05,562
I saw it in him
when he was 5 years old.

833
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:07,331
People, they don't
want to feel fooled.

834
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:10,033
You know, there's,
"Oh, I knew he had it in him

835
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,568
when he wouldn't open the door
for me one time,"

836
00:44:11,602 --> 00:44:14,004
- that sort of thing.
- Yeah, you kicked a cat.

837
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,073
Yeah, I kicked a cat,
and one time,

838
00:44:16,106 --> 00:44:18,475
I jumped up out from behind
the bushes to scare Ann.

839
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:19,676
Well, who hasn't done that?

840
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,112
And one time, it was that I...

841
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:23,580
I-I walked along
the railroad tracks

842
00:44:23,614 --> 00:44:25,315
to see how long I could go
without falling off.

843
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:26,683
I mean, come on.

844
00:44:26,717 --> 00:44:28,619
It's ridiculous.
Give me a break.

845
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:32,589
Jumping out from the bushes
was never my thing anyway.

846
00:44:32,623 --> 00:44:36,560
There are a lot of myths
and misunderstandings about me.

847
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,996
Like you're a...
a master of disguise.

848
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:41,732
Oh, my God.
Yes, yes.

849
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:44,501
Just half a dozen photographs
of my many faces.

850
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:46,670
But they were all taken
within a 10-year period.

851
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:49,206
They had
my graduation photo from '65

852
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:51,208
and my arrest photo from '75.

853
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:55,312
If you grow a beard, say,
just innocently grow a beard

854
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:58,282
or you come in...

855
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:00,751
in a different mood,
wearing a different expression,

856
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,587
people are gonna think you look
like a different person.

857
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,225
But this is the myth
that they wanted to tell,

858
00:45:08,258 --> 00:45:10,294
the master of disguise.

859
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:11,628
But when you were caught,

860
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:14,064
you had to tell the police
who you were,

861
00:45:14,097 --> 00:45:16,133
even though you were
on the FBI's top-10 list.

862
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:18,969
I told them.
They didn't believe me.

863
00:45:21,405 --> 00:45:23,207
When you were a fugitive,
did that list have

864
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,541
any bearing
on the way he behaved,

865
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:27,311
My manner of survival,
yeah, yeah.

866
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,746
But to be honest...
and I don't mean

867
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:31,615
to insult your intelligence
or anything...

868
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:34,218
but I don't think
you all catch anybody.

869
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:35,619
Not really.

870
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,690
I mean, there are exceptions,
certainly, but...

871
00:45:39,723 --> 00:45:43,193
I think most guys get
themselves caught.

872
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:45,596
Well, do you think sometimes

873

go through with it?

1045
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,876
- Can't it be both?
- No, it can't.

1046
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:21,611
The Florida Supreme Court came
back with their ruling tonight,

1047
00:54:21,644 --> 00:54:23,247
7-2.

1048
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,316
I mean, I have one more appeal
with the U.S. Supreme Court,

1049
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,918
but they really mean to kill me.

1050
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:29,987
- They really want to kill me.
- [LAUGHS]

1051
00:54:30,021 --> 00:54:31,889
You think this is funny?

1052
00:54:31,922 --> 00:54:33,958
You've been sitting here
for eight years.

1053
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:35,692
What do you think
they brought you here for?

1054
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,594
It's just now starting
to sink in?

1055
00:54:37,627 --> 00:54:40,231
BUNDY: Y-Yeah.
I knew it.

1056
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:43,700
I knew I knew it,
but I just now thought about it.

1057
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:45,269
They're going to kill me.

1058
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:46,837
They're going to kill
my mother's son.

1059
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:49,306
Maybe they will.
Maybe they won't.

1060
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,909
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1061
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,145
Let the bastards try, huh?

1062
00:54:54,178 --> 00:54:56,047
[CHUCKLES]

1063
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,983
Look, you've got to do this.
You've got to come clean.

1064
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:01,085
I will. I'm gonna do what
I can in a major way.

1065
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:03,154
I'm gonna give them the truth,
but in a measured manner.

1066
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:05,122
You can't hold
these girls hostage.

1067
00:55:05,156 --> 00:55:07,124
Not anymore.
That tactic will backfire.

1068
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:10,161
If anyone senses that you're
stalling on this, you're cooked.

1069
00:55:10,194 --> 00:55:11,728
Oh, no, you're right.

1070
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,798
It's time to come clean.

1071
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:15,866
But we still have a couple
of cards up our sleeve.

1072
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,634
- Like what?
- You'll see.

1073
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:19,270
You just focus on making sure
the investigators bring

1074
00:55:19,303 --> 00:55:22,373
the right material
and stay on track.

1075
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,975
What's the plan?

1076
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:27,211
There are investigators
coming in from Utah,

1077
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,280
Colorado, Florida, Idaho,

1078
00:55:29,313 --> 00:55:31,015
Idaho? Why Idaho?

1079
00:55:31,048 --> 00:55:32,883
I've got a couple surprises
for them.

1080
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,286
I told you, you can't play games
with the governor of Florida.

1081
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:37,388
You're not in any position
to extend your life

1082
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,656
by giving them some
Henry Lee Lucas kind of stuff.

1083
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:41,658
- What are you talking about?
- Why Idaho?

1084
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:43,726
Don't worry, Billy.
I got us covered.

1085
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:46,297
- I dropped two in Idaho.
- "Billy, I got us covered"?

1086
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:49,066
Why would I be happy that you
killed two girls in Idaho?

1087
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,135
No, you're right.
You're right.

1088
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:53,370
But Florida isn't gonna
do anything for me.

1089
00:55:53,404 --> 00:55:57,007
Colorado, Washington, Oregon,
Utah can't do anything for me.

1090
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,242
But Idaho...

1091
00:55:58,275 --> 00:55:59,810
They're gonna ask for more time.

1092
00:55:59,844 --> 00:56:01,345
BUNDY: And they can
petition the governor.

1093
00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:03,247
- Ted, you cannot...
- BUNDY: I'm not stalling.

1094
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,782
I'm not playing games.

1095
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:06,317
I'm coming clean.
And if that means bringing

1096
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,985
other states into the mix,
then so be it.

1097
00:56:08,018 --> 00:56:09,386
- How many?
- Five.

1098
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,122
Not how many states.
How many girls?

1099
00:56:11,155 --> 00:56:13,723
- Am I talking about?
- How many did you kill?

1100
00:56:13,757 --> 00:56:14,691
That.

1101
00:56:14,724 --> 00:56:17,094
HAGMAIER: Yes, that.

1102
00:56:17,128 --> 00:56:18,695
[SIGHS] Let's say 30.

1103
00:56:18,728 --> 00:56:20,231
Let's say we talk
about the real number.

1104
00:56:20,264 --> 00:56:21,966
30 is a nice round number.

1105
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:23,700
How many?

1106
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:25,236
I don't know.

1107
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:27,004
What do you mean you don't know?

1108
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:30,307
I didn't keep score,
and it gets confusing.

1109
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,443
I don't understand
what gets so confusing.

1110
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:35,012
I'm not even sure
all of them are dead.

1111
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:36,746
BUNDY: There are several girls,

1112
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,884
girls that I hit over the head
and put in my car.

1113
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:41,285
When I would drag them
out to the woods.

1114
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:44,155
they would wake up,
sometimes in my arms.

1115
00:56:44,188 --> 00:56:46,824
Sometimes when I went back
to my car to get my tools.

1116
00:56:46,857 --> 00:56:48,292
They all took off
into the woods,

1117
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,727
and I couldn't find them.

1118
00:56:50,761 --> 00:56:51,996
I'd go home.

1119
00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:54,932
I'd watch the news,
but not a peep.

1120
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,767
No news.

1121
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,903
So did they run home
and change their name,

1122
00:56:58,936 --> 00:57:00,371
never to tell anyone
what happened,

1123
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:02,806
afraid that I would
come back and try again?

1124
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,875
Or did they die in those woods?
I don't know.

1125
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:08,479
So, it could be more than 30?

1126
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,381
Then there are the dry runs.

1127
00:57:10,414 --> 00:57:11,949
Dry runs.

1128
00:57:11,982 --> 00:57:13,484
BUNDY: There are a lot
of girls I stalked,

1129
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:16,420
learned everything about,
staked out my spot,

1130
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:19,190
walked up to their door,
passed them on the street,

1131
00:57:19,223 --> 00:57:20,758
and just walked away.

1132
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,259
Why?

1133
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:24,795
BUNDY: Because every time
I did this, I asked myself,

1134
00:57:24,828 --> 00:57:26,330
am I going to kill this girl?

1135
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,999
Sometimes I said no,
and I never went back for her.

1136
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,733
I didn't understand.

1137
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,436
Because the minute I say no
and couldn't walk away,

1138
00:57:32,469 --> 00:57:35,372
it was the minute I was
on the road to being caught.

1139
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:38,842
Diane Leach.

1140
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:42,279
I couldn't say no.

1141
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:44,348
She was a mistake.

1142
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:46,250
I should never have killed
a 12-year-old girl.

1143
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:47,818
<i>- She</i> was a mistake?
- Yes.

1144
00:57:47,851 --> 00:57:50,754
- And the others?
- Choices.

1145
00:57:50,788 --> 00:57:53,157
Can't really call those
mistakes, can I?

1146
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,959
So 30.

1147
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,430
I can for sure admit to 30.

1148
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:04,802
Why am I here, really?

1149
00:58:04,835 --> 00:58:08,772
Bill, we've spent a good deal
of time together.

1150
00:58:08,806 --> 00:58:11,075
Not as much as some
of the others.

1151
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:14,511
Yes, but you knew all along,

1152
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:16,513
and you treated me
like a human being.

1153
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:18,782
You just wanted to understand.

1154
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:20,851
I still do.

1155
00:58:20,884 --> 00:58:24,121
That's why you're here.

1156
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:26,056
Each of the investigators
get two hours.

1157
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,459
I have a handful
of other interviews.

1158
00:58:28,492 --> 00:58:30,527
And then
when everything is clear,

1159
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:32,997
you and I will sit down
and have the conversation

1160
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,399
you've wanted this whole time.

1161
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,002
What are you going to tell me?

1162
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:40,137
Everything.

1163
00:58:41,905 --> 00:58:45,376
[TENSE MUSIC PLAYS]

1164
00:58:50,147 --> 00:58:52,249
What's this... gizmo?

1165
00:58:52,283 --> 00:58:54,585
This will pick up everything
you're saying

1166
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,955
and everything that we're saying
over here on the other side.

1167
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:00,224
BUNDY: Well, let's just
get it out in the open now.

1168
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:03,193
Mike, I know you have
some intense feelings about me.

1169
00:59:03,227 --> 00:59:05,262
- No.
- Well, you may or you may not,

1170
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:06,830
but if you think
I'm bullshitting you,

1171
00:59:06,864 --> 00:59:08,032
you tell me.

1172
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,833
If I thought you
were just gonna...

1173
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:12,136
jack it around all day,
I wouldn't be here.

1174
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:14,204
All right.

1175
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:15,839
I've been sent here
to talk to you

1176
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:17,141
about Grand Junction.

And Vale.

1179
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:25,049
Let's start with
Bountiful, Utah.

00:59:25,082 --> 00:59:26,583
I really need a map for that.

1181
00:59:26,617 --> 00:59:28,452
Eugene, Oregon.

1182
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:32,956
And then we'll move on
to West Linn and in Corvallis.

did you take these girls from?

00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:45,536
which victims are yours.

1190
00:59:49,073 --> 00:59:52,309
for us to go back

maybe even as far back as '68?

No.

Yes, we're trying to get maps
down here as soon as possible.

to describe the area,

Well, that was a long time ago.

There were a lot of girls
since then.
