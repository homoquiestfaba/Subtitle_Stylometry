All right? And we'll see

of the snow ball?

that they do every year

the children of fallen soldiers

it's meet the general day,

00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,863
Otherwise,
she's gonna get fired.

689

- She can't get fired.
She works for herself.

00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,734
- You know what I mean.

691
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,670
We have to do this
for the troops,

692
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,071
and we have to do this
for belle.

693
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,976
- Then that's it,
only one night.

694
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,745

697

Why am I wearing it?
- Because it's Christmas,

698
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,723
and you're performing
at a Christmas show.

699
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,826

Hey, come on.

Tell me the truth, does this
whole getup make me look fat?

Come on, look.

- Wow.
- What?

704
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,842
- Santa's a lucky guy.
- He used to be.

705
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:45,249
- Georgia, does this little
place remind you of the cabin

706
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:46,917
we were supposed to spend
our honeymoon in?

707
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,553
- Supposed to, keyword.

708
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,223
Yeah, instead, we wound up
in a hotel room in Trenton

709
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,993
because you booked a concert
on our honeymoon night.

710
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,896
- Yeah, I did.

711
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,831
- We were all set
for a romantic weekend

712
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:04,535
in the mountains,
and you booked a gig.

713
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:08,572
A gig, Joe. Romance went
right out the window.

714
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,642
- We needed the money, Georgia.

715
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:14,244
And believe me, I felt bad ever
since I did that.

716
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,814
But the promoter said
that if we played Trenton,

717
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:19,616
he'd book us
in some other show.

718
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,685
- Is that how we got the show
in Atlantic city?

719
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,453
- Yes, that's how we got
that show and the show after it

720
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,856
and the one in the Catskills.

721
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,158

- Sure.
- Yeah.

- Mom, why don't you
trade places with dad?

725
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,434
- Okay.
- All right.

726
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,569
Hat on, hat off?

727
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,504
- Hat on.
- Great.

728
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,112
- Mom, can you scoot
a little closer to dad?

729
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,349
- Can you see the tree?

730
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,652
- Okay, well,
this would be all right

731
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,754
for a prom photo,
but you're Georgia and Joe!

732
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,923
You know, maybe try
looking at each other?

733
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:08,799
- Okay, don't freak out.
This is just for the photo opp.

734
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:10,634
- That's why I'm doing it.

735
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,839
Oh! Hello.

736
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,007
- Sir.

737
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,308
- At ease, soldier.

738
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,910
- General hays, hi.

739
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,346
It is so nice
to officially meet you.

740
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:24,615
I'm belle winter,
and these are my parents.

741
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,751
- Oh, I know who they are.
I'm a big fan.

742
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:30,287
Georgia and Joe, thank you
for agreeing to perform

743
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,888
for the soldiers
and their families.

744
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,890
- It is an absolute pleasure
to meet you, sir.

745
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,792
- It's an honor for us
to be a part of this.

746
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,227
- And I would be honored
if the two of you

747
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,695
would take a photo with me.

748
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:41,665
- Why not?
- Absolutely!

749
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,637
- And don't worry,
it's an encrypted phone.

750
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,272
- Oh, good,
I wouldn't want our picture

751
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:52,476
to fall into the wrong hands.
[Laughter]

752
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,711
- I'm gonna share this photo
with the troops.

753
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,013
I think it'll
raise their spirits.

754
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,081
The show is streaming overseas.

755
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,384
- Ah, that's great!

756
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,518
- You know, I don't know
anything

757
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,153
about military maneuvers,

758
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,390
but I do know
how to put on a concert.

759
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:09,126
What do you think about
getting video messages

760
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,262
from the soldiers overseas
and then putting those messages

761
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,098
up on the video screens
before the concert?

762
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,366
- Yeah, that's
a stellar idea, Georgia.

763
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,035
- Yeah?

764
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,469
- Captain, I want you to get
on that immediately.

765
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,904
- Yes, sir.

766
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,874
- It was really nice
to meet you all.

767
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,942
I wish I could stay, but I have
a meeting back at the base.

768
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,211
- We totally understand.
- Yes, we do.

769
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:31,782
[Laughter]

770
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:34,685
That's a pretty darn good idea
you had there, Georgia.

771
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,486
- Well, thank you.
- Pretty darn good?

772
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,588
That was a fantastic idea, mom.

773
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,857
- Thanks, belle.
- It was perfect, ma'am.

774
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,061
- Thank you,
and you can call me Georgia.

775
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,362
- And you can get back to work.

776
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,663
- Oh! Yep.

777
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:48,932
- Oh.
- Yep, here we go.

778
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,103
Ready?

779
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,905
[Camera shutter snapping]

780
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,781
- Your parents really turned
it on for the general.

781
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,049
- Yeah.
- They actually look

782
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,351
like a couple.

783
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:11,321
[Chatter]

784
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,324
Yeah, if you don't mind me
asking,

785
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:16,760
why'd they ever get divorced?

786
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,395
- They're not divorced.

787
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,797
They separated
and had the papers drawn up,

788
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,533
but neither of them
ever signed them.

789
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,002
- Why'd they even separate?

790
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:29,005
- It all started around
the time I went off to college.

791
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:32,676
My dad had always written all
the songs, but he'd hit a wall.

792
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:35,879
Everything he was writing
just wasn't working.

793
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,782
So the record label wanted them
to start singing

794
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,452
other people's songs,
which my dad refused to do.

795
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:47,324
So my mom agreed to record
a solo album without him.

796
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,592
- He thought that
he was demoted.

797
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,460
- Yeah,
and then he wrote a song

798
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,963
about their problems,
which made mom madder.

799
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,431
"Christmas without you"?

800
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,266
- That one is a heartbreaker.

801
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,034
- It was a hit for Dolly.

802
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:02,072
My dad kept writing songs,
just not for my mom.

803
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,508
My dad thought that my mom
didn't need him anymore,

804
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,810
and she felt the same way.

805
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,912
They were both nominated
for grammys that year,

806
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:12,249
my mom for record of the year
and dad for song of the year.

807
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,785
But when my dad went up
to accept his award,

808
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,753
he didn't mention my mom.

809
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,156
He later said he just forgot,

810
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,857
and then when mom
won her award,

811
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:24,060
she didn't mention my dad,
either.

812
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:26,463
My dad moved out that night.

813
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,232
It's been 15 years.

814
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,535
They haven't performed
together since.

815
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,576
- So tell me about
the snow ball.

816
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,745
- A lot of our soldiers
never come home,

817
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,448
so the snow ball raises money
for their families.

818
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,550
- For example, the song
"white Christmas,"

819
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,819
that was actually written
about soldiers

820
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,388
who weren't able to make it
back home for the holidays.

821
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,323
- Will you be singing
"white Christmas"?

822
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,991
- Maybe.
We're going to be singing a lot

823
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,893
of everyone's favorite
Christmas songs.

824
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,329
- Yes, we will. And who knows?

825
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,131
We might even be singing
a brand-new song.

826
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,635
- Oh, we didn't
talk about that.

827
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,938
- No.
That's because it's a surprise.

828
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,506
- It sure is.

829
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,007
- Yeah, I've been writing
a little something.

830
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,242
- Really?
- Well, that sounds promising,

831
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,377
especially coming from a writer

832
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,113
who was just inducted into
the songwriters hall of fame!

833
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:20,016
- Oh!
Yeah, hey, let's not forget

834
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,253
Georgia was just nominated
for her 16th Grammy.

835
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,055
- Well, thank you, Joe.
That's very sweet of you.

836
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,523
- You deserve it.
- Thank you.

837
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,625
- You've both had
very good solo careers.

838
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,694
How do you feel about
performing together again?

839
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,496
- Honestly,
I'm a little nervous.

840
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:33,630
- Really?

841
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,398
- Yeah, let's face it.

842
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,834
We haven't done this together
in a very, very long time.

843
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,570
- Oh, I think we still have it.

844
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,072
- Well, your fans
have wanted you

845
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,607
to get back together
for years.

846
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,275
- Well, we're very excited

847
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,011
to get back together
for this Christmas concert.

848
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,715
- Yes, because we love our
troops, and we love Christmas.

849
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,683
- It's gonna be
a heck of a show.

850
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,418
- So, hey, everybody out there,

851
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,220
get your tickets
for the snow ball

852
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,789
because it's Joe
and Georgia time.

853
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,758
- Georgia and Joe time.

- [Mouthing]

856
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,765
- Good morning.

You didn't have to bring
everyone peppermint lattes.

858

01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,141
and the power went out
from the big storm.

1375
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,877
Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1376
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,479
- This is kind of fun.

1377
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:52,881
- This whole week has been fun.

1378
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:56,952
Part of the reason why I agreed
to this reunion concert

1379
01:00:57,054 --> 01:01:00,188
is so you and I can spend
more time together.

1380
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,590

for the same thing.

1381

and...

1387
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,410

seeing him again at Christmas

1392
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,420
just makes it
all even more special.

1393

the last concert of the tour.

All of us were
at the wrap party,

1398
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,140
and your dad and I
were hanging out together.

1399
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:54,042
We didn't realize
that everybody had already left

1400
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,711
to go back to the hotel,

1401
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,113

most of the power lines,

this one out.

1410

Georgia must have gotten
really under your skin again.

when I accepted this job,

1549

a fantastic show,

1570
