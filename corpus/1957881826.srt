00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,781
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,384
(man scatting)

00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,235
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,684
(upbeat hip hop music)

00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,333
(alarm blaring)

00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,134
- Yes!

00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,906
(dramatic music)
(Gypsy barks)

00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,841
Right on time.

00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,677
It worked, Gypsy!

00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,145
(Gypsy barking)

00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,114
Good afternoon, guys.

00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,082
All right, I've
downloaded your equations

00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,785
and I've processed it
into my hard drive.

00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,086
The roses are in the bucket,

00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,255
so if all goes well,

00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,158
this formula should keep
them from aging, right?

00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,793
- Technically, it should.

00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,195
But I still think you
didn't use enough-

00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,630
- What are you talking about?

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,066
I have told Willie the
exact amount of everything.

00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,102
My plants are living for 40
times past their usual lifespan.

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,671
So, Willie, you try it out.

00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,044
- I don't know if I
like the color she used.

00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,581
- Mrs. Donovan, that
looks beautiful.

00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,520
And I love your hair. That
style really suits you.

00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:39,225
- You can call me Mom. I
already told you about that.

00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,862
- (sighs) All right. Here goes.

00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,269
(machine beeping)
(machine whirring)

00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:55,508
(fluid gurgling)
(dramatic music)

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,085
- You don't think this
makes me look like one

00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,289
of those wanna-be-young
grandmas, does it?

00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,090
- Oh, no, Mom.

00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
I don't.

00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,300
- It is absolutely
beautiful here, Barry.

00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,703
You picked a wonderful
place to live, son.

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,039
- Yeah, Monique
and I, we love it.

00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,873
- Guys?

00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,610
You didn't say
anything about smoke.

00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,246
- Willie, the smoke
will not harm you.

00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,481
It is just white,
odorless smoke.

00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,850
An indicator you used
too much formula.

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,987
Now you must stop it before you
lose visibility in the room.

00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,821
- Okay.

00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,461
- Mom, this, um, interest that
you have in the way you look,

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,530
it wouldn't have anything to do

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,764
with Dad coming
into town, would it?

00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,032
- The creature?

00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,401
- Is Miss Thing
staying at the house?

00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,437
- If you mean Mom, yes, she is.

00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,738
- You see, that's on you.

00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,673
You could've told me
that she was coming.

00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,609
I'd have rearranged my trip!

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,245
- So self-absorbed!

00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,914
- Honestly, whenever that
man looks into my eyes,

00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,617
the only thing he
sees is himself!

00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,285
- I mean, she is
really something.

00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,121
She can be the biggest
pain in the behind

00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:15,989
that I have ever seen.

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:16,889
You know it.

00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,492
- Are you gonna be able
to get through this?

00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,194
- Yea, though I walk
through the valley

00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,729
of the shadow of death,

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,464
I will fear no evil.

00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,765
For thou art with me.

00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,867
Thy rod and thy staff-

00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,274
- Oh. Willie, whatever
you do, don't use water!

00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,808
- Well done, Herr Accreditation.

00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,777
Perhaps you should have warned
Willie about this beforehand?

00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,113
- [Scientist] No hair? You
ought to talk about hair.

00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,949
(scientists bickering)

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,954
(Gypsy barks)
(steam hissing)

00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:49,989
- Oh!

00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,461
(suspenseful music)
(Gypsy barking)

00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,630
♪ There was once
a place and time ♪

00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,165
♪ When I thought
you cared for me ♪

00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,834
♪ Yes, it's true ♪

00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,604
- Willie?
- What do I do?

00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,438
Willie?

00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,576
(dramatic music)

00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,246
(Gypsy barking)

00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,684
- (coughing) What
did I do wrong?

00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,353
(bell ringing)

00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,757
(dramatic music)
(dispatcher chattering)

00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,427
(siren blaring)

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,097
(Gypsy barking)

00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,899
Gyps, where are you?

00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,369
(siren wailing)
(dramatic music)

00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,938
- [Woman] Where's
the fire truck?

00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:39,772
It should be here by now.

00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,974
(Willie coughing)

00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,443
- [Willie] What have I done?

00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,080
Oh, man, I'll be
grounded for life.

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,749
(siren wailing)

00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,021
- [Woman] Oh, and
it's a new house, too.

00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,690
(siren wailing)

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,695
(Sydney sighs)

00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,198
(dramatic music)
Whoa. (coughing)

00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,668
(glass crashing)

00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,570
What are you guys doing here?

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,638
- [Firefighter] It's all clear!

00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,573
Got one over here!
- Get off me!

00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,807
You're gonna ruin my experiment.

00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,609
- [Firefighter] It's
okay, son. Just relax.

00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,244
- [Willie] No, you
don't understand!

00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,445
- [Firefighter] All right,
let me get you out of here.

00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,513
- No!
- Got one! I'm coming out!

00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,182
(Gypsy barking)

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,986
(mysterious music)

00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:32,792
(Gypsy barking)
(dramatic music)

00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,293
- [Willie] Come
on, guys. Please!

00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,629
Just a little bit more time.

00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,701
Guys, why'd you do-
- You should do it more often.

00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,337
- [Firefighter] You okay, kid?

00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,539
- [Willie] (sighs) I'm fine.

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,740
- [Firefighter] Can you
take a deep breath for me?

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,142
- [Willie] See,
look. I'll show you.

00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,213
- I think he's
okay. Thanks, guys.

00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,284
Hey, kid, don't
play with the truck.

00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,118
Sit.

00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,089
What's your name, son?

00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,525
- Will Smith.

00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,959
- Now let me guess,

00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,261
you were just getting jiggy
with it in the garage?

00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,696
Now, your real name this time.

00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,931
- I live here. This is my house.

00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,199
- [Firefighter] Excuse
me, sir. Sir, you can't-

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,835
- Willie! Willie,
are you okay, son?

00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,871
- Yeah, but they messed
up my experiment.

00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,972
- False alarm.

00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,207
- I'm sorry.

00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,575
- What did you do?
- Hey, grandpa.

00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,378
- Come on, let's go
assess the damage.

00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,113
Leave you two alone
for half an hour,

00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,414
and this is what happens?

00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,482
Where's your sister?

00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,316
Sydney!

00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,486
- Dad? Dad, what is this?

00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,787
- [Barry] Where have you been?

00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,988
- What?

00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:36,923
I was upstairs, and
all of a sudden,

00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,525
I see this smoke every...

00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,426
What did you do?

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,129
- What do you think?

00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,063
- What? Oh.

00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,333
Hi, Grandpa. I am so sorry.

00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,801
I didn't even see you.

00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,971
- There's my beautiful
granddaughter. (laughing)

00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,972
It is amazing.

00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,440
You are the spitting image

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,176
of your Grandma Cat
when she was your age.

00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,745
Of course, you're a
lot more level-headed.

00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,280
- [Sydney] (laughs)
Thanks, I think.

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,715
- No, no, don't get me wrong.

00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,084
On the outside, she's
still beautiful.

00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:10,089
But sometimes the
inside can effect

00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,757
the way you look on the outside,

00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,461
and your grandmother's
insides are twisted

00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,130
and mauled and all around wrong.

00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,100
And the way her
brain works, I mean,

00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,639
the logic she employs is like,
on another level altogether.

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,807
- [Barry] Dad.

00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,610
- What happened?

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,711
- Is everyone all right?

00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,679
- Everyone's fine, Grandma.

00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,382
- Mr. Einstein here was working

00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,451
on another one of
his experiments.

00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,752
- Oh, Willie.

00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,987
How many times have I told you

00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,522
to pay attention to
what you're doing?

00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,590
Honey, you're playing with
dangerous chemicals here.

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,425
- I thought I was being careful.

00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,927
- No, you weren't.

00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,162
Now, until you learn to take
much more responsibility,

00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,132
your lab equipment
is off-limits.

00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:53,966
Understood?

00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,636
Do you understand, young man?

00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,805
- Yes, I understand.

00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,173
- Okay, let's get
things cleaned up.

00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,942
- What, what? Me?

00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,710
Oh, no. Uh-uh, I have to go.

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,312
I mean, I'm already
late for work.

00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,180
Why don't you let him
do it? It was his fault.

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,448
- Well, wait, wait.

00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,683
You're gonna come home
early, though, right?

00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,751
I'm making a family dinner.

00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,252
- Yeah, sure, sure.

00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,487
Just make sure there's no
meat. I don't eat meat.

00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,422
- I know, I know.
- Bye, Dad. Bye.

00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,957
- I'll make you
something special.

00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,093
Oh, my goodness.

00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,129
Look at this mess.

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,630
Willie, oh!

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,065
What have you done?

00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,236
(smooth jazzy music)

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,306
Willie? Willie!

00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,207
I think it's best
you get the soap box

00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,943
and bring it upstairs with me.

00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,044
- Should I go now?

00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,880
- I think it's best you do.

00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,921
- We're not finished yet.

00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,323
You are grounded.

00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,325
- Take it easy, Barry.

00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,559
(Cat sighs)

00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,196
You gonna ignore
me all week, Cat?

00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,030
- How can I?

00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,033
You're in my face.

00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,937
- No one asked you to come
here this week, you know.

00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,707
Man can't even visit
his own grandchildren?

00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,277
- They're my grandchildren
just as much as they are yours.

00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,846
- Yep. Same old bitter woman.

00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,183
- Looking at the
same old selfish man.

00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,520
(dramatic music)

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,757
(Gene sighs)

00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,760
(suspenseful music)

00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,830
- [Monique] Willie!

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,131
Don't forget to put fresh soap

00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,567
in your grandparent's bathroom!

00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,303
(dramatic music)

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,840
(upbeat music)

00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,814
- (giggling) Busy afternoon?

00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,751
- Busy? Maybe for this burg.

00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,987
You don't know busy until
you've seen the stores in L.A.

00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,522
That's busy.

00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,192
- (groans) Well, Brad says
you're catching on fast.

00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,228
- Hey, I'm from California.

00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,763
We do everything fast.

00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,300
- (giggling) Sydney, look,
I know you miss L.A.,

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,637
but there's a lot of cool
things and people here, too.

00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:12,571
- Mm.
- Yeah, come on.

00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,106
Give it a chance. You'll see.

00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,941
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,143
It's in the stars.

00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,245
Yeah, oh, yeah. I can feel it.

00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,947
The moon and Venus are aligning.

00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,349
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,784
Yep, I feel it.

00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,486
Strange and wonderful
things are gonna take place.

00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,124
Oh, oh, oh!
- What?

00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,193
- Oh, do you recognize
him from computer class?

00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,528
- [Sydney] Yes.

00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,130
(gentle music)

00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,836
- Holy jumping, wow. You
can e-mail me anytime, baby.

00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,805
Oh!

00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,175
Oh.
- Mm, mm, mm, girls!

00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,142
(record scratching)

00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,610
You musta wished upon a star,

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,481
because tonight is your
luckiest night by far.

00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,515
- Oh, please.
- Oh, my-

00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,617
- So, seriously.
- Oh, my god!

00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,519
- Girl who is so funny,

00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,556
how'd you like to roll
with Mr. Milk and Honey?

00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,724
- Milk and honey?

00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,258
- Oh, yeah.
- Are you serious?

00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,263
- I do not joke when it's
matters of the heart.

00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,533
- You know what,
um, my shift's over.

00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,902
So I will see you later, okay?

00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,304
Call me, Julie.

00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,072
- Yeah, my name's
Terrence, but that's cool.

00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,140
We'll get that later.

00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,144
So your friend, she seems
to be taken with me.

00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,379
- Oh, taken with you, is she?

00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,614
- You know what
I'm talking about.

00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,882
- Yeah, I know what
you're talking about.

00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,650
I'm talking about this
right here like that.

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,252
You know? Okay.

00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,854
Can I get a price check, please?

00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,991
(crickets chirping)

00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,660
(clock chiming)

00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,630
- What ya doing there, kiddo?

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,133
- Oh, hey, Grandpa.

00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,634
- What's up?

00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,637
- Well, since I can't
use my lab set anymore,

00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,173
I'm using my computer to
do virtual experiments.

00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,042
- Ooh, quite the little
scientist, aren't we?

00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,313
- A bad one if you ask
anyone around here.

00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,350
- Oh, then I guess you
won't be needing this.

00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,253
- What is it?

00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,623
- Open it up. (chuckles)

00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,801
- Whoa! A real, authentic
scientist lab coat!

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,704
Thanks, Grandpa!

00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,040
- (laughs) That's
for inspiration.

00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,811
You're a very talented
young man, Willie.

00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,679
Once you're off your grounding,

00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,981
you can wear that thing,
but not before, okay?

00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,284
And listen.

00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,087
You got the right attitude.

00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,723
You're young, you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,626
You've got plenty of time to
do what you have to do. Okay?

00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,597
And remember one thing:
Grandpa loves you.

00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,468
(gentle upbeat music)

00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,269
- Grandpa?

00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,273
I love you, too.

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,381
- Heavenly Father, we ask
you to bless this food

00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,916
we are about to consume.

00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,719
Please help it to nourish
our bodies to do thy will.

00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,222
And, Father, we ask you
for special blessings

00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,823
for Barry and his family

00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,859
in this wonderful,
wonderful celebration

00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,594
we are having right now, Father,

00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,162
for those who were invited

00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,797
and for those who
were not invited.

00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,499
Some of us need more
prayers than others.

00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,268
We ask you, dear Lord,
to bless this food.

00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,836
In Your name, we pray. Amen.

00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,171
- [All] Amen.

00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,973
- And you were referring to-

00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,409
- So, how do you like
your new town, Sydney?

00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:44,383
- Oh, well, um, you know those
old black and white films

00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,918
that we see on TV?
- Mm.

00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,888
- Well, they're years
ahead of this town.

00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,155
(Gene chuckles)

00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,857
- Kids. You've got
to love them, Dad.

00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,692
- Yeah, right.
- No meat, right?

00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,160
- Right.
- Moo.

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,562
- You'll make new
friends, honey.

00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,064
You've only been in this
school for two weeks.

00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,636
You must make this
experience a positive one.

00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,037
- Grandma.
- Hm?

00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,673
- This place is so not me.

00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,943
- Yeah. People here are nice.

00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,077
- Dad, please.

00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,245
- Willie.
- Sorry.

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,814
- Honey, you're
still gonna try out

00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,217
for the cheerleading
team, though, aren't you?

00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,685
- Well, yeah, I guess.

00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,755
I mean, I was good when we
were living back in L.A., so-

00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,723
- Hey, it's a good
place to meet people.

00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,792
Especially the boys.

00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:30,696
- You're new here, pumpkin,
and it just takes time.

00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,366
Remember, the mountain
didn't come to Mohammed.

00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,235
Mohammed had to go
to the mountain.

00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,705
- Your grandmother's
right for a change.

00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,674
You've got to go after
what you want, sweetheart.

00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,176
- Right for a change?

00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,711
- Oh, my bad.

00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,947
Your grandmother's right for
the first time in her life.

00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,518
- Listen, Mr.
Thinks-he's-so-hip,
you're such a fool!

00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,787
- Well, it takes
one to know one.

00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,056
- [Cat] I don't know how
they put up with you.

00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,590
- Well, I don't know how
they put up with you.

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,059
(phone ringing)
- I'll get it.

00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,527
- I don't know why I even
bothered to show up here.

00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,762
I knew you would be
nothing but trouble.

00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,664
- Believe me, if I had
known you were coming,

00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,200
trust me, I wouldn't have.

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,169
Talk to the hand.

00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,036
(kids laughing)

00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:11,870
- Oh!

00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,344
- Jenny's in labor! (laughs)

00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,082
(smooth jazzy music)

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,654
- I cannot believe you are
leaving them to watch us.

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,822
- What's wrong with that, honey?

00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,056
- They hate each other.

00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,726
- Willie, they do
not hate each other.

00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,361
We had no idea this
was going to happen.

00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,663
Aunt Jen wasn't due for,
like, three more weeks.

00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,232
- She's never been early
for anything before.

00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,569
- Well, I guess we better
hide the kitchen knives.

00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,371
- Look, I promised your Aunt Jen

00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,140
that I would be there for
the birth of her baby.

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,010
And we did the best that
we could. I'm sorry.

00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,747
- Baby, you seen my-
- Yes, second drawer.

00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,383
Where did I put my eye cream?

00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,551
Honey, don't forget
your sinus medicine.

00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,320
Now, what, oh, yeah.
Need my deodorant.

00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,922
- Hey, Dad.

00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,093
Dad, why do you always jump
when Monique says jump?

00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,496
I mean, if Mom was here-

00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,765
- Hey, that is not fair.

00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,001
We've been over this
time and time again.

00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,137
Hey, baby, look at me.

00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,142
When Mom died, it was the
worst day in both of our lives.

00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,046
We've got to move on.

00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,282
Monique is my wife now,

00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,751
and she is your step-mom
and she loves you.

00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,888
- Yeah, but you never
have time for me anymore.

00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,523
It's always her.

00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,724
- Sugar, don't say that.

00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,660
We're only going to be in
California for a couple of days.

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,128
I tell you what.

00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,165
I promise you that
when I get back,

00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,201
we'll spend as much time as
you want to spend together.

00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,035
- Promise?

00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,971
- I promise.

00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,207
(gentle music)

00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,042
- All right. All right.

00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:57,843
All right.

00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,080
But, I mean, if you guys are
only going for a few days,

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,983
then why is Monique packing
a month's supply of shoes?

00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,320
- [Monique] Ah. Woo!

00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,261
(pill bottle thudding)

00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,134

- [DJ] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,958
This is Joanne at your jazz
hits radio station, W.J.A.Z.

00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,828
You just heard from the
Tri-Ess Trio Jazz Quartet

00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,396
and right about now,

00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,199
I'm bringing you into
the midnight hour.

00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,602
Hope you sit back,
relax, enjoy the music,

00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,372
and have a wonderful evening.

00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,142
(dramatic mysterious music)

00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,639
- [Vickie] Morning, everybody.

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,041
This is Vickie,
coming to you live.

00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,609
- [Big J] Good morning,
it's the Big J.

00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,745
Happy sight and I'm feeling
right. How about you?

00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,715
- [Vickie] I'm feeling good.
And the weather's good today.

00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,184
- [Big J] The
weather's fantastic.

00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:22,120
(radio chattering)

00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,928
(Gene scatting)
(smooth jazz music)

00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,743
- [Monique] Dad!
Dad, come on down!

00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,011
Breakfast is ready!

00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,413
- Okay, I'll be
right down. Whoo!

00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,050
Better hurry up, guys. You're
gonna miss your flight.

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,186
- I can't believe
that Mom isn't up yet.

00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,287
You know, I think I'm
gonna go and wake her.

00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,421
- No, no, no, no, son.

00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,623
No, I've got everything
under control.

00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,423
Let her sleep.

00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,093
For the whole 10
days, if I'm lucky.

00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,299
(engine rumbling)

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,968
(alarm ringing)

00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,709
(Cat humming)

00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,784
(Cat screams)

00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,387
(Cat gasps)

00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,289
- Okay, okay.

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,326
Okay, just, (gasps) calm
yourself down, Catherine.

00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,260
Calm yourself down.

00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,664
You're, you're dreaming!

00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,065
That's it. That's it.

00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,971
You're asleep. Just
wake yourself up.

00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:47,906
Yeah.

00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,077
(hand slapping)
(bright music)

00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:57,049
Okay, now, I'll just
look back in the mirror,

00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,085
and, and this time, I'll be...

00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:06,758
(Cat screams)
(dramatic music)

00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,062
(Cat panting)

00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:10,896
Huh?

00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,441
(smooth jazzy music)

00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:28,046
Now, I can work
with that. My voice.

00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:29,948
My voice!

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,484
Oh, Lord.

00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,454
What has happened to me?

00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,425
Hmm.

00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,261
What has happened to me?

00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,167
(Cat gasping)

00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,578
Hey.

00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,345
Oh, my.

00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,517
(Cat giggles)

00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,885

It's me, Gyps.

00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,862
Grandma Cat.

00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,397
Surely you recognize me?

00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,231
(Gypsy growling)

00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,065
Maybe not.

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,403
Now, you just wait right there.

00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,205
Do you know who you
are dealing with?

00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,673
I am a 67-year-old woman,

00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:06,478
and I am not gonna let my
grandson's dog intimidate me.

00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,146
Whoa, what are you doing now?

00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,448
Hold on a second!

00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,749
(Gypsy barking)

00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,583
Get! Get!

00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,754
(Cat shrieks)

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,660
(locks clicks)

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,162
(gasping) No!

00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,667
(Gypsy barking)
(dramatic music)

00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,069
(Cat groans)

00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,771
Yeah.

00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,081
(Gene scatting)

00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,288
(chimes tinkling)

00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,502
(radar beeping)

00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,171
(siren blaring)

00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,055
(gentle jazzy music)

00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,628
(dispatcher chattering)

00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,735
- Yes, officer?

00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,571
- You know what the speed
limit is around here?

00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,173
- Um, no, no. I
can't say that I do.

00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,441
All right, let me see some ID.

00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,943
Give me your driver's license.

00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:47,779
- Okay.

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,220
(Gene scatting)

00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,288
There you go.

00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,827
- This your car?

00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,197
- No, no, no. This is,
uh, this is my son's car.

00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,034
I just dropped him and the
missus off at the airport.

00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,902
- All right, step
out of the vehicle

00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,304
with your hands in the air.

00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,106
- Is this one of
them speeding traps?

00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:15,941
- Now.

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,444
- Yes, sir.

00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,753
Drop your keys. Slowly.

00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,988
- Look, officer,
couldn't you just give me

00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:30,889
a speeding ticket?

00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,160
- This is a lot more serious
than a speeding ticket, pal.

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,362
Where's the guy you
stole this car from?

00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,130
- Look, this car is not stolen.

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,599
I told you, it is my son's car.

00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,667
- Yeah? And it's
pretty obvious that-

00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,272
- Back off!

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,942
Freeze! I didn't tell
you to move, punk!

00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,545
We're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,779
- I sure hope so.

00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,649
- [Dispatcher] Attention, all
units, we have a code three.

00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,883
Please respond.

00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,020
- You stay right here
and don't move a muscle.

00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,892
Yeah, this is Officer Ratto.

00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,095
I'll deal with your code three.

00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,396
I've got a situation here.

00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,964
I want you to run
a license for me.

00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,432
- It's a miracle.

00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,567
- [Ratto] Yeah, I'm having
a problem with a kid.

00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,302
17-years-old.
- Or I'm going crazy.

00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,505
- I got him on a
speeding ticket.

00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,108
Yeah, the car's
not registered...

00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,510
(smooth jazzy music)

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,344
Hey. Hey!

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,715
(radio chattering)

00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:34,052
(upbeat music)

00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,221
(tires screeching)

00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,224
(suspenseful music)

00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,843
(Gypsy barking)

00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,022
(Gene panting)

00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,958
- All right, Tracey!
That was fabulous!

00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,261
Thank you very
much. That was good.

00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:20,065
Okay, um, Sydney Donnelly?

00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,468
- Donovan.

00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,237
It's Sydney Donovan.

00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:28,907
- Right.

00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,083
(dramatic music)

00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,754
(upbeat techno music)

00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,844
- Aw, yeah. She's pretty good.

00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,013
(upbeat techno music)

00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,055
(Sydney panting)

00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,490
- How'd I do?

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,258
- You was banging. I
mean, you were real good.

00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,561
- Hey, excuse me. You're
the new girl, aren't you?

00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,829
- Yeah-

00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,364
- Well, you've certainly
got a lot of potential.

00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,966
Maybe with a little
more practice.

00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,200
- Practice.

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,668
- Who knows?
- I don't.

00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,137
- It was a very good first
try, though. Maybe next time.

00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,838
All righty, I'm sure we'll
see each other around school.

00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,508
Who's next, Kim? Kim Anderson?

00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,443
- Yeah, yeah, just hold on.
- Kim Anderson.

00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,277
- [Kim] Coming.

00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,111
- Next.

00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,016
- Ash, I don't get it.

00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,918
What didn't you like about her?

00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,487
- (sighs) I smell an
attitude problem. Major.

00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,725
- Yeah, so do I. (huffs)

00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,829
- Next.

00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,100
- Yo.

00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,970
I saw what happened.

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,805
You cool?

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,974
Aw, man.

00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,013
Well, if it's worth anything,
I thought you was all that.

00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,847
Seriously.

00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,216
I think Ashley made a mistake.

00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,484
She's my sister, I'm gonna
talk to her right now.

00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,786
- Look, look, I don't
need your help, okay?

00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,122
I can take care of myself.

00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,795
- You know what my coach
is always telling me?

00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,565
He says you're only a
loser when you give up.

00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,134
I don't think you're a loser.

00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,938
Why would you want to do that?

00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,372
You're real good.

00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:42,473
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,643
- Well, obviously
not good enough.

00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,215
(people chattering)

00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,089
Look, I'm sorry, I-

00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,191
- Hey, baby. You miss Daddy?

00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,927
Listen, we gots to
stop meeting like this,

00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,663
because people are
starting to talk.

00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,333
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, that's right.

00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,903
So, girl, I know you needs me,
but I'm real busy right now.

00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,137
- You know what? You need help.

00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,173
- Yo, keep it down,
girl. No broadcasting.

00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,442
- [Student] Hey,

00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,276
- Sydney.

00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,148
Y'all should be in school.

00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,918
- What's that?
- What's that, lady?

00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,722
- [P.A. Announcer] Good

00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,024

00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,826

names please report to-

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,697
- Girl, he is cheatin'!

00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,199
You know, I stop--

00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,770
So what's up? You
trying to get down?

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,839
- Uh, down?

00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,574
No.

00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,342
I'm not down.

00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,779
Well, I am a tad bit upset.

00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,080
You would be too

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,081
if you were having the
morning I was having.

00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,082
- Shut up.
- Shutting.

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,151
- Are you dissin' me?

00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,353
- Uh-huh, she dissin' you, girl!

00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,389
- Serious dis.

00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,559
- Look, I know you
probably had a rough day.

00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:14,899
You probably failed an English
test of something. (laughs)

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,534
- You want some of this?

00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,540
- Okay now, young
lady, that is enough.

00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:27,545
Nobody puts their hands on me.

00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,247
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,215
All y'all.

00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,218
Instead of focusing
on your studies,

00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,453
something that could make

00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,921
your pathetic life
worth something,

00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,589
you around here acting
like some common criminal.

00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,091
I know your mother did
not work her butt off

00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,227
so you could go to school
acting like this every day.

00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,698
Now, I am in the
middle of an emergency.

00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,100
And the next time I see
you, you better be acting

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,135
like the young lady
I know you can be

00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,303
instead of some hoodlum.

00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,573
You understand?

00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,076
(blow thudding)

00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,811
(toilet flushing)

00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,749
- [Sydney] Was it me?
No, it wasn't me. (sighs)

00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,452
(sighs) I hate this town!

00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,089
- Oh! (panting)

00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,691
(bell ringing)

00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,394
- Can you help me with this?

00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,295
Came loose.

00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,567
- Your brain's what
came loose, fool-child.

00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,068
You need to go home
and thank the Lord

00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,504
your mommy and daddy haven't
kicked you out of your house.

00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,673
Looking like the devil himself.

00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,308
You need some help.

00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,210
Oh, sugar, honey,
iced tea, not again.

00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,581
(student laughing)

00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,082
When did kids get so violent?

00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,752
- [Sydney] That sounds like
something my grandma would say.

00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,586
- Sydney?

00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,122
- Grandma?
- You?

00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,158
Something's happened.

00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,327
Oh, this is big.

00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,130
- (gasps) Who the?

00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,801
- It's me. Grandma Cat.

00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,170
- What?

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,671
- I can't believe it myself.

00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,007
But here I am.

00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:03,841
- What?

00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:05,910
Oh.

00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:10,314
Oh, my gosh.

00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:12,917
- Oh. Ooh!

00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:14,819
- [Sydney] Willie!

00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,525
- [Willie] What?

00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,960
- [Sydney] Will you hurry up?

00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,365
- Why are you late?
- Just get in the car, okay?

00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,800
- [Willie] What's up with you?

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,001
- [Sydney] Just get in the car.

00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,904
I cannot tell you
about that right now.

00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,209
- Who's the freak
in the front seat?

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,645
- Don't you call me a freak

00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,914
just because something
weird happened to me.

00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,215
I'm your Grandmother, boy.

00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,452
- Grandma?
- Did I stutter?

00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,354
- Grandma Cat?

00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,024
What happened to you?

00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,393
You look like Syd.

00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,930
- Yeah, well, guess what,
Mr. Scientist, we know that.

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,131
- Stop it!

00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,365
- Tell us something
we don't know, okay?

00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,202
- Oh, wow, Grandma.

00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,705
Have you been in my stuff?

00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,140
- Of course not.

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,942
- Oh, wow, Sydney.

00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,210
We've got to hurry
up and get home

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,479
so I can run some
tests on Grandma.

00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,713
No wrinkles.

00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,115
- [Cat] If you touch
me one more time,

00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,949
I swear I'm gonna smack
you upside your head.

00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,219
Sit back.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,691
(upbeat music)
(Gene chuckles)

00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,459
- Yo, I can't believe you
left a brother out to dry.

00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,727
- Well, see, what happened was

00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,362
I was going to go from behind-

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,899
- I don't want to hear
your fables, Judas.

00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,801
Man, you should
have been stickin'-

00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,203
Hey, dude, watch out!
- Whoa!

00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,107
- Damn.

00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,777
Oh, boy wrecked my ride.

00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,049
- Yo, man, you 'aight?

00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,551
- Yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool.

00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,953
But this guy needs
some crazy medicine.

00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:56,921
- Yo, let's see if
we can get him up

00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,422
and bring him over to the store.

00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,390
- All right.

00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,895
(door knocker rapping)

00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,265
(upbeat music)

00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,333
- [Ratto] Good afternoon,
young lady. Your parents home?

00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,037
- Uh, no.

00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,639
They're away on a trip, officer.

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,974
Grandma!

00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,478
Can you turn that down, please?

00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,117
(laughs) Can I help
you with anything?

00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,585
- You have any adult
supervision around here?

00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,720
- That would be me.

00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,989
- You're her twin.

00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,090
- Her twin?
- Twin.

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,559
- I'm her grand-
- My twin.

00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,427
Such a kidder.

00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,899
- I stopped a young kid this
morning driving a Ford Explorer

00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,702
registered to a Barry
Donovan at this address.

00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,370
- Dad's car?
- Is Barry okay?

00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,639
- Well, we'll know better

00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:49,840
when we find the
kid who was driving.

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,242
Maybe he can shed
some light on things.

00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,611
- Kid?
- Yeah, about your age.

00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:57,014
He was carrying this
driver's license.

00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,986
- Wait a minute. What
did this kid look like?

00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,689
- About six foot, wearing
gray slacks, gray trench coat,

00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,058
black fedora with a red
feather on the side.

00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,992
Do you know him?

00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:08,993
- That's your grandfather.

00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:09,994
- Grandpa?
- Grandpa?

00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,498
(Gene groans)

00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,933
- Yo, check it.

00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,501
Mr. I'm-Gonna-Go-50
In-a-20-zone is comin' to.

00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,903
Word.

00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,304
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,539
- What happened?

00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,407
- What happened?
Oh, what happened?

00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,209
I can't remember
what happened. Leo?

00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,612
- I don't know, let's
see. What happened?

00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,380
- Oh, I remember what happened.

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,849
You knocked me flat
on my back, sucker.

00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,318
- I did?

00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,120
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, you did.

00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,655
Where you coming from? Damn.

00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,324
- I saw what happened.
Are you okay?

00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,626
Is there something
I could get you?

00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,061
- Yeah, I'm-
- Well, well, well.

00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,198
If it isn't little
Miss Gold Digger.

00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,467
- Now, look-
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,202
C'mon now, young fella.

00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,171
That's no way to be
talking to a lady.

00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,540
- Young fella?
- That's no way

00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,708
to be talking to a lady.

00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,948
- Mm, mm, mm. (sighs)

00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,816
Barbecue spare ribs,

00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,418
macaroni and cheese,

00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,186
and jalapeno mashed potatoes.

00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,158
- (scoffs) Um, Grandma?

00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,993
Aren't you overdoing it?

00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,230
- Well, that's what
we're about to find out.

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,932
See, these are foods I used
to eat when I was young.

00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:26,437
Man, I haven't had spicy
food like this in 10 years.

00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:30,041
I haven't had dairy
products in five.

00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:30,975
Lactose intolerant.

00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,011
Mm. Mm, mm mm.

00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,816
Just as good as I remember.

00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,554
- Grandma, I've checked
all the prescriptions

00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,122
and lotions that you use.

00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,557
There doesn't seem
to be anything

00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,759
that could've caused
your transformation.

00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,660
Now, think.

00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,898
Did you use any
bit of this soap?

00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,634
- (scoffs) Wait, soap?

00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,669
Great, Einstein.

00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,838
What do you want us
to do, take a bath?

00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,841
- Well, that's the
soap in the bathroom?

00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,076
I used it.

00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,445
- Syd, would you just
listen to me for a sec?

00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,379
- All right, I just
don't believe it.

00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,980
You're gonna have to explain it.

00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,550
- This bar of soap
was in the box

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,585
that my chemicals spilled
all over yesterday.

00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,623
I'll have to run some tests
to see if it's contaminated.

00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:23,961
Yesterday, I put it in the
grandparent's bathroom.

00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:29,967
- So Grandpa must
have taken a shower

00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,403
this morning using
the same soap.

00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,071
- Maybe when the
chemicals mixed,

00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,975
it created some kind of
fountain of youth effect.

00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,679
The chemicals got in
their bloodstream and...

00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,483
- [Willie And Sydney]
Instant teenage grandparents.

00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,619
- No indigestion?

00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,155
No upset tummy.

00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,724
- Can you reverse the process?

00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,128
- I don't know. I just figured
out how it probably happened.

00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,129
- (sighs) All right,
all right, all right.

00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,597
Just do your best, okay?

00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,832
And just do it before
Monique and Dad get home.

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,636
- Wait, does this
mean I'm not grounded

00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,138
from my lab equipment anymore?

00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,906
- Willie, I am
giving you permission

00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,941
to use whatever you need, okay?

00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,577
Just be careful. And hurry.

00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,979
- Cool.

00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,914
- Funny guy. Mr.
Funnyman in a hat.

00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,483
- [Leo] Hold on. She's
writing something.

00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,885
- Yo, that dude's got game.

00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,654
He's a female magnet.

00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,624
Yo, I think we's gots
to be rolling with him.

00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,125
- I hear that.

00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,560
- I sure hope Grandpa's okay.

00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,862
- I'm sure he's fine.

00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,766
Just don't expect him to come
around here anytime soon.

00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,567
- Why not?

00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:42,440
- Because he's selfish
and irresponsible.

00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,110
And if he's 17 again,

00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,412
he's gonna want
to do it all over.

00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,613
No strings attached.

00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,083
- Listen, new guy,
you stick with us,

00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,053
because we are the serious
players up in this one.

00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:56,854
- Serious.

00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,924
- Serious players.
- Word up, look.

00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,693
We'll turn you into a mack
daddy lover, just like us.

00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,595
- [Leo] Yeah, what you say?

00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,096
- Well, I-
- Come on.

00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,898
- I don't know about all that.

00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,900
- [Leo] What's the deal?

00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,539
- You all live around here?

00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,007
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,375
- Okay.

00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,910
(upbeat music)

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,646
- See, Gypsy? It's
just another bath.

00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,951
See, I'm gonna
get you all clean.

00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,519
Good girl.

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,188
(Gypsy whining)

00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,793
(Gypsy barking)

00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,627
(gentle music)

00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,630
- (chuckles) Woops.

00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,136
- You look great, Gram.

00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,139
- Aw, thanks, baby.

00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,509
- Can I ask you a question?

00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,343
- Anything, baby.

00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,678
- All right.

00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,150
Um, what happened
with you and Grandpa?

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,893
(Cat sighs)

00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:13,063
- Well. (sighs)

00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:14,732
Well.

00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:20,771
Hmm.

00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:28,779
You mean, why'd we divorce?

00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,613
- Yeah.

00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,552
I mean, Grandpa, he's so...

00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,719
He's so young

00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,557
and he's so fun and so hip.

00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,958
- Your grandfather's a fool.

00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:47,298
- Well, then, why
did you marry him?

00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,035
- Well, he wasn't
always that way.

00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,405
He was a good husband.

00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:56,907
Faithful.

00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,577
A good provider.

00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,980
- Then what happened?

00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,589
- (sighs) I don't know.

00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,725
But enough about me, Sydney.

00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,598
You're young. You
have a great life.

00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,299
You live in a wonderful town.

00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,736
Why do you hate it so much?

00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,237
- I just do, Grandma.

00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,176
I mean, I had such
a great life in L.A.

00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,980
I mean, there's so many people

00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,516
and everyone there, they're so
alive, you know what I mean?

00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,318
Everyone's so boring here.

00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,488
- Everything and everyone?

00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,861
There isn't one thing you find
the least bit interesting?

00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:54,965
- No.

00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,804
(gentle music)

00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,607
(door clicking)

00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,610
- Welcome to Casa de Terrence.

00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,980
- Okay, okay. Now,
where are your parents?

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,282
- My parents, I don't,
working, I think.

00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,751
Paying the bills, you know.

00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:15,719
- You lying, man. I thought
you said they were on vacation.

00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,121
Like in the motherland,
or something.

00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,789
- Man, I don't know.
Maybe they're upstairs.

00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,257
Why you buggin' me?

00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,992
- Yeah, uh, where's
your telephone?

00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,327
- Telephone, yeah. Right there.

00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,762
Help yourself.
- All right.

00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,764
I love your house, man.
You always got food.

00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,466
- [Terrence] Yo, straight
up. My parents is providers.

00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,703
(smooth jazzy music)

00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,204
So, did you see

00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,708
how many phone numbers I
scored today at the mall?

00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,542
Huh?

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,211
- [Leo] Huh, you
mean Gene scored.

00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,615
- [Terrence] And did you see
how the honeys was peeping me?

00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,484
- [Leo] Hmm, you mean
peeping Gene now.

00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,719
(phone ringing)

00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,187
- [Terrence] Look, they
was only peeping Gene

00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,422
'cause he was hanging with us.

00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:56,293
Check it, the honeys
see us teaching Gene-

00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,361
(Gene growls)

00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,030
So, if we hang with him,

00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,533
we could have all the
honeys in the world.

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,974
- All the honeys?

00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,042
- Like a buffet.

00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,845
- Like a buffet.

00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,680
- That's what I'm talking
about. So what you say?

00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:21,418
(smooth jazzy music)

00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,625
(Gene laughing)

00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,660
So, what you say?

00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,863
- I don't know,
man. It's like...

00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,432
You know I'm down for that.

00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:36,633
- You kidding, man? Bam!

00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,669
- You a genius!
- We gonna be bangin'!

00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,270
You know what I'm saying?

00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,209
- You're a genius.

00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,044
- Yeah. All right.

00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,513
- What?

00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,750
- So, where you staying at?

00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,521
- Well, I was gonna stay
at my family's house,

00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,457
but it looks like I'm gonna
have to stay at the Holiday Hut.

00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,825
- [Both] The Holiday Hut?

00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,027
- No, no, no, brother.

00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:07,064
Why stay at the hotel-ay

00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,868
when you can chill right
here with the fell-ays?

00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,704
- That sounds like a plan.

00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,207
Yeah. That's what I'm
talking about, yeah.

00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,881
(Gypsy whining)

00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,120
- Gypsy!

00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,822
Gypsy, it worked!

00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,590
You're a puppy!

00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,761
See, I told you I wouldn't do
anything to hurt you. (laughs)

00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,730
It worked!

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,064
- Willie, I'm going to scho-

00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,067
Who's puppy?

00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,302
- It's Gypsy.

00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,237
See, I needed a test subject

00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,740
so I could see how to
reverse the aging process.

00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,208
And it worked!

00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,577
- All right, I'm
counting on you, Willie.

00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,345
Now, I'm letting you stay
home from school today,

00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,481
but you have got to
change Grandpa and Grandma

00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,616
before Monique and Dad get home.

00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,984
All right?
- Okay.

00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,819
- Be careful.

00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,654
Bye, Gypsy.

00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:11,195
- Gypsy, we've got
a lot of work to do.

00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,197
Let's get to it.

00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,200
(people chattering)

00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,703
- [Server] There you go.

00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:20,904
- This is very upsetting, Todd.

00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,739
- I really think
you're overreacting.

00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,174
- Really?
- Yes.

00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,176
- I am days away from putting
on the first major dance

00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,278
of the senior year,
and you tell me the DJ

00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,048
that you scheduled has
suddenly pulled out?

00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,182
I am class president.

00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,550
Class icon.

00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,651
Monarch High It girl.

00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,321
For God's sakes, you know that.

00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,423
- Now, if you would just listen
to me for one second, I can-

00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,091
- The dances that I have put
on for the past three years

00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,093
have become the stuff of legend.

00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,328
The Senior High School Dance

00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,030
must be the pinnacle of
my high school career.

00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,166
- That's why me and you are
gonna strut ourselves down

00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,367
to the Orange Club.

00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,869
We're gonna check
out that new local DJ

00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,237
'cause I hear the boy can spin.

00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,438
So you don't have
to worry about it,

00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,606
'cause your brother
got it covered.

00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,107
- Well, why didn't you say so?

00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,010
So, Todd, who are you
taking to the dance?

00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,578
- I don't know.

00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,046
I was kind of thinking
about Sydney Donovan.

00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,414
She cute.

00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,684
- Whoa, rewind. Same
question, new answer, please.

00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,787
- Same answer. Sydney.

00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,222
- Todd-
- What?

00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,425
- No, I cannot have my
brother dating the new girl.

00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,994
- Okay, now you've
totally lost me.

00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,562
What's wrong with
Sydney Donovan?

00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,863
- She doesn't fit in.

00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,799
Plus she hangs with
that loser girl.

00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,167
- You talking about Julie?

00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,235
- You know her name?

00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,537
- Yes, I do. (laughs)

00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,307
- Plus, you don't even know
this Sydney. You just met her.

00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:31,842
- That is the exact reason

00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,011
why I'm taking her to the
Orange Club tonight, okay?

00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,946
Honeybun, let me tell
you something, okay?

00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,714
You may be my big
sister and all,

00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,918
but you's got to learn to
stay out of my business.

00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,653
I still love you.

00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,487
Go on.
- Yeah.

00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,992
(people chattering)

00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,295
- Hey.
- Grandma!

00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,933
I don't think this
is a good idea.

00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,501
- I'm young again, Sydney.

00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,138
I want to, I want
to experience life.

00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,540
At least until Willie finds
out how to turn me back.

00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,043
- Yeah, but how am I
going to explain you?

00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,146
- Look, tell people

00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,149
that Oprah helped you find
your long lost cousin.

00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,583
I love that Oprah.

00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,086
Remember that time that woman
socked that other woman?

00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,587
It was crazy.

00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,790
Wait a minute, that was
Jerry Springer, not Oprah.

00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,757
- All right, all right.
All right, all right.

00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,459
But I gotta warn you.

00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,195
School's probably a
lot different than
how you remember it.

00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:26,496
- Honey, please.

00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:28,665
It's still reading,
writing and arithmetic.

00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,567
How much can it change?

00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,103
(bell ringing)

00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:37,140
- This is a condom.
It is a latex condom.

00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,875
And we place it over the head

00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,745
of the fully erect turgid penis.

00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,947
We roll the condom
down the shaft

00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,183
all the way down to the base.

00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,552
Now, upon withdrawal,

00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,654
holding on to the
base of the condom,

00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,690
we easily slide
it off like this.

00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,727
All right, class.
Now it's your turn.

00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,062
(Cat gasps)

00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:03,200
(hand thudding)

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,368
- Shh.

00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,037
- How do you turn this thing on?

00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,341
(computer dings)

00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,376
Oh.

00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,044
- [Computer] Wassup?

00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:16,913
- I'm fine.

00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,283
- (laughs) Grandma,
it's a computer.

00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,687
- It was talking to
me, so I answered back.

00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,393
(upbeat music)

00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,663
(computer beeps)

00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:35,899
(alarm beeping)

00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:36,800
Oh, oh.

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,570
- Shh.
(Cat screaming)

00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,640
(people chattering)

00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,678

I can see your underwear.

00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,325
- Am I getting a headache?

00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,094

00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,563

00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,265
That's my boy, yeah!

00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,301
- Hi, I'm Ashley.

00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,369
Great performance.

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,270
- Well, thank you.

00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,472
Thank you. Um, I'm Gene.

00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,608
- Some friends of ours are
going to the Orange Club tonight

00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,876
to listen to some bands.

00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,744
I was hoping you'd
like to join us.

00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,513
- Oh, we're gonna have to
check our calendar, girl,

00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:57,914
but I'm sure it'll be just fine.

00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,250
- It's not an open
invitation, geek.

00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,186
- Talking to me? Yeah, I'm
gonna sit right back down.

00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,656
- Gene?

00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:10,327
- (gasps) Oh, my gosh. Grandpa?

00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,661
- Gene?

00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,729
- Well, um...

00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,767
- Yo, my man, you've gotta
make this move right here.

00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,303
I mean, this is a
major hottie, you know?

00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,173
I'd do it myself, but, you
know, I'm gonna hook you up.

00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,508
- Oh, you know what?
I've gotta get to class.

00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,577
Um, can I trust you
to get Grandpa Gene

00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,012
and meet me back at
the house after school?

00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,814
- Yeah, yeah, sure. I've
got this under control.

00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,749
- Okay.
- You just go to class.

00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,217
- So you go and do your thing.

00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,619
- Mm-hmm.

00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,521
Okay, yeah.

00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,355
- Great.

00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,057
And you know, listen.

00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,231
- Gene!

00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,299
- Sydney!

00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,534
- No.

00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,635
- Cat?

00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,571
- Blow away. We're busy.

00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,706
- Well, go get busy with
some other fool, girl.

00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,575
'Cause I need to
talk to this one.

00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,409
- [Terrence] That's
what I'm talkin' about.

00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,577
- Excuse me, child.

00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,711
- I'll get out of
your way, girl.

00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:09,019
- [Gene] Hey! Whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,454
I didn't know it
happened to you, too.

00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,123
- It was the soap
we washed with.

00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,992
It got contaminated from the
chemicals in Willie's lab.

00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,562
You would have known that if
you would have called home.

00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,063
- Whoa, hey, Cat,
Cat. Look, look, look.

00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,466
You know what? Hey, I was
planning on doing that.

00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,569
But, you know.

00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,605
- Well, Willie's working on
a way to get us back normal.

00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,006
- What?

00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:30,840
Why?

00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,643
I like things just
the way they are.

00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:34,477
- What?

00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,413
- Cat, look at us, Cat.

00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,516
We are 17 years old again!

00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,417
Look at this!

00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,388
- Oh, Lord.
- Hey, feel that.

00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,023
- I don't want to feel nothing.

00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,792
Aren't you at least
a bit concerned

00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,727
with what's happened to you?

00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:55,332
- Hey, I am 17 years
old again, okay?

00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,467
I don't care how it happened,

00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,902
I'm just glad it did.

00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,405
- There might be
side effects, Gene.

00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,941
We don't even know how
long this will last.

00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,042
- Which is why

00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,513
I'm going to ride this
thing out as long as I can.

00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:13,617
I, I mean, why should
I waste my energy

00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,620
trying to turn back
into a 67-year-old man?

00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,290
Constantly, constantly
being reminded of my age

00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,460
with every step that I take.

00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,961
You know what that is?

00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:25,962
- What?

00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,464
- Booty.

00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,832
- Booty?

00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,100
- Booty.

00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,601
- Will you listen to yourself?

00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,237
Who are you trying to fool?

00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:38,074
We don't fit in with
this generation, Gene.

00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,878
And I don't care how
young you look or talk,

00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,447
you will never fit in.

00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:48,084
- Oh, oh, you, you know why
I haven't been home, Cat?

00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,354
There's your
answer, right there.

00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,591
- You know what?

00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,928
This is really sad. (chuckles)

00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:02,532
You finally look the way
you've acted your entire life.

00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:05,769
17 years old.

00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:11,841
- Well, I'm going to stay
17 years old, you old woman.

00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,680
- Fine by me, you old man.

00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,181
Do what you want to do.

00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,583
- I am gonna do what I want
to do, and you know what?

00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,320
I don't need your
permission to do it.

00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,757
(Cat groans)

00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,696
- [P.A. Announcer] ROTC
training takes place

00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,366
at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon
right behind the south gym.

00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,935
- Sydney! Sydney!
- What?

00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,837
- Um, I was wondering

00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,139
if you'd like to go
out with me tonight.

00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,275
Look, there's this place,
it's called the Orange Club,

00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,577
they've got all these
DJs I want to check out.

00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:54,484
- I'd love to go out
with you, young man.

00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,652
- [Todd] Would you, now?

00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,591
(chuckles) Well,
all right, then.

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,160
Look, I'm gonna see you tonight.

00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,065
(bell ringing)

00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,234
I'm feeling good, brother.

00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,704
(door thuds)

00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,609
(people chattering)

00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:24,280
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,548
- Oh, oh!

00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,783
Take advantage of a brother.

00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,085
Living off kritz,
baby. Look at this.

00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:30,387
Wassup? What you got?

00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,621
- Ready?
- What you got?

00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,123
Too slow. You're too slow.

00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,891
Come on. You can't even
catch what you can't see.

00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,127
- Boom!
- Look at that. Boom!

00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,661
- Hey, fellas.

00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,297
Hey, hey, fellas.

00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,799
Homies, hey!

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,300
- Right in the belly, and
you know you got a big one.

00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,302
- [Gene] Hey, my,
my bloodhounds!

00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,271
My dog pound, what's
up, what's up y'all?

00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,540
Hey, hey.

00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,541
- Come on.
- Stick and move, baby.

00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,942
Stick and move.

00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:53,877
- My, um.
- You're too slow.

00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,345
You're too slow.
- All right.

00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,613
- Don't you two, you know,
want to get out of the house?

00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,481
Maybe go and do a
little something?

00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,116
- Come on, man, you're
messing up my combo.

00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,084
- Yo, what's up, G?

00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,055
- Man, is this all
y'all gonna do?

00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,257
- You ain't got me.

00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,426
- You know, you play
your video games

00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,294
and watch your music videos.

00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:15,064
- Uh, other than chasing
hotties, what else is there?

00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,132
- What else is there?

00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,169
Man, there's life
out there, man.

00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,004
- Boom!
- The pulsing-

00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,138
- Pushing right out of the move.

00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:25,575
- Beautiful, unexplored,
delicious life!

00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,776
- I'm gonna sit
you down, fat boy.

00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,211
- Out that door, waiting
for you to taste it.

00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,013
- Hey, I'm up for some grub.

00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,314
How 'bout some Taco Hell?

00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:33,082
- Naw, naw, naw. Domino's, dude.

00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,350
They deliver.

00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,752
- True dat, true dat.

00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,020
- [Terrence] Hey,
come on. Look at that.

00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,954
- [Leo] Cheap shot is the one.

00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,522
Man, lose the frown lines, dude.

00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,858
You got a date with
a hottie tonight.

00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,126
So what's the problem?

00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,361
- [Terrence] Hey, pause,
man. Stop cheating, man.

00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,196
- Yeah.
- Dang.

00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,734
- I've got a date with
a 17-year-old hottie.

00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,404
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,339
(bell ringing)

00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,275
- [Terrence] I didn't
want to play anymore,

00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,944
so that means you lost.

00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,613
- So, what happened
at school today?

00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,216
I miss one day, and I feel
like everything's changed.

00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,484
The stars are aligning, Sydney.

00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,487
I'm telling you, the
universe is in flux.

00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,056
- Tell me about it.

00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:13,923
Yeah, I mean...

00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,359
What's wrong with you?

00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,261
Your voice is generating
unstable biorhythms.

00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,731
- (sighs) I don't know.

00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,933
It's just that my grandmother,
right, she came into town

00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,602
and I'm just trying to get used

00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,104
to the changes that
we're going through.

00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,506
You know what, I better go.

00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,542
It looks like my
grandmother needs my help.

00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,512
- So am I gonna see you at
the Orange Room tonight?

00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,513
- Well, I don't know.

00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,947
- Well, Todd will be there.

00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,350
- Yeah, and so will a
lot of other local boys.

00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,584
You know what, I
have to go, okay?

00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,419
I'll just talk to
you later, bye.

00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:47,190
(dial tone buzzing)

00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,358
(Julie sighs)
(phone rings)

00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,192
- Oh.

00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,327
Psychic friends hotline.

00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,031
No, Dionne Warrick is
not here, thank you.

00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,905
- You look great, Gram.

00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,009
- I do look good, don't I?

00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,746
Mm. I can't believe it.

00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:13,983
I'm finally going on a date! Me!

00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,085
- Relax, Grandma.
It ain't no thang.

00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,156
- Well, maybe it
ain't no thang to you,

00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,758
but if the last time
you went on a date

00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,960
was to see the new singing
sensation Nat King Cole,

00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,929
trust me, baby, it is a thang.

00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,198
(Sydney laughs)

00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:30,033
- Whatever.

00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,036
(bright music)

00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:33,870
Ooh!

00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,439
Big Mama!

00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,675
Look at you!

00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,111
Now, you look fabulous.

00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,148
- Thank you. I have arrived.

00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,617
Now, if your grandfather
can have fun,

00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,451
why shouldn't I?

00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,154
- (laughs) You know, Grandma,

00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,922
I can not believe
I'm saying this,

00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,124
but you have become
one of my best friends.

00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,694
- Well, let's just hope
you feel the same way

00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,896
once I'm an old woman again.

00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,299
(both laughing)

01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,767
(doorbell ringing)

01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,602
That's my date.

01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,503
- Ooh, right on time.

01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,138
That's a good sign, Grandma.

01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:13,042
So, which Monarch High guy

01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,944
is lucky enough to be going out

01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,615
with my 67-year-old
Grandma, huh?

01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,417
Todd?
- Sydney.

01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:22,619
How you doing?

01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,187
- (gasps) Oh, my God.

01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:25,655
What is he doing here?

01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,590
- That's my date.
- No!

01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:28,825
Grandma, no!

01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,893
No, you cannot-
- Of course I can.

01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,362
- No!
- Now look.

01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,464
I am not gonna toy with this
17-year-old boy's heart.

01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,531
Now, move.

01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,501
- No, no. Grandma, no.

01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,971
(knuckles rapping)

01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,940
- You like this boy.

01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,242
(Sydney sighs)

01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:48,077
Baby, now-

01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,879
- Grandma, that's okay-
- No.

01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,047
No, it is not okay.

01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,850
Now, look, he obviously
thinks I'm you.

01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,222
(sighs) All right, I'll go with
him to the Orange Club now-

01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,957
- Grandma!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:04,160
After you get dressed,
you just hustle on down

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,764
to the Orange Club and
when the time is right,

01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,931
we'll make the switch.

01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,133
- I cannot believe you. No!

01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,634
I am not gonna do that!

01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,069
- You got any better ideas?

01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,205
(knuckles rapping)

01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:17,840
- No.

01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,075
But I also don't have a dress

01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,244
that looks like
that in my closet.

01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,346
- But you do have something
short, black, and clingy.

01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,647
Now put it on.
- No.

01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,149
- And if he notices
the difference

01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,517
between those two outfits,

01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,552
you had no chance
with him anyway.

01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,654
Now, what do you
all say? Audi 2000?

01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,756
- No, we say one.
- One?

01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,224
- We say one.
- What do you say?

01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,059
- One.

01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,294
- Well, I'll see
you later, okay?

01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:40,229
- Bye.
- Bye. Hi, Todd.

01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,099
- [Todd] You get dressed fast.

01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,567
Didn't I just see
you in a sweatshirt?

01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,603
- [Cat] I'm from L.A.
We do everything fast.

01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:50,206
- Where have I been? L.A.

01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:52,408
(dramatic music)

01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,877
(car honking)

01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:04,087
(people cheering)
(upbeat music)

01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,628
And here it is, the
hottest spot in town.

01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:13,896
Everybody comes down here,
gets their groove on.

01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,798
You know what I'm saying?

01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,134
Yeah.
- Hey, what's up, Todd?

01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,269
- All right then. You know?

01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,104
Cool?

01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,407
What, Ashley?

01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,641
Don't worry about Ashley.

01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,511
Let's, let's go
over here, lounge.

01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,681
- Whoo, girl!
- Yeah.

01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,985
- [Woman] All right!

01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,754
- [Woman] You got it.

01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,561
- Oh, hey! My gosh!

01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,664
(both laughing)

01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,833
Hey, Sydney, what
are you doing here?

01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,902
I thought you said
you weren't coming.

01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,003
- When did I say that?

01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,905
- An hour ago on the phone.

01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,341
- Oh, oh.

01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,876
Well, here I am.

01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,780
- There you are. You look great.

01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,516
Oh, man, so, hey, have
you spotted him yet?

01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,517
- Who?

01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,885
- The man of your dreams.

01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:09,986
- Yeah.

01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:10,987
- Yeah?

01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,421
- I think I have.

01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,290
- [Todd] Here we go.

01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,492
Hope I got something you like.

01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,161
- Todd.
- How you doing, Julie?

01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,429
- Hello, what brings
you out this evening?

01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,298
- I'm here with her.

01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,499
- Oh, you're here together?

01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:26,269
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, you're here with, oh!

01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,103
Sydney.

01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,307
I couldn't quite figure
out what he was at first.

01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:34,777
Then I realized,
holy cow. (laughing)

01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:37,113
- Oh, well, well, well.

01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,881
If it isn't the loser sisters.

01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,384
- Sydney?

01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,119
- [Cat] Guess again, lover boy.

01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,521
- [Gene] Cat. What
are you doing here?

01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,191
- Just ignore her
like I'm trying to do.

01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,659
- What am I doing here?

01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,527
What are you doing
here with her?

01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:52,862
- He's my date.

01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,463
I mean, just how
well do you know her?

01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,399
Did you go to school with
her before you came here?

01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,434
- Oh, yeah, we went
to the same school.

01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,236
The school of Holy Matrimony.

01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:04,006
- You know what, you're not
only desperate, you're psycho!

01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,008
- Excuse me?
- Ho, ho, ho, hey!

01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,009
That is enough.

01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,313
- Come on, baby. Let's go dance.

01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,617
(upbeat music)

01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,128
(people chattering)

01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,664
- These are $500
shoes. Can you keep up?

01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:30,867
Come on.

01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,470

everybody for coming out

- One more dance.
- No.

01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,739
I have to find Sydney.

01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,542

your little friend?

01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,748
- Cat, do you know what,
what song they're playing?

01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,518
- Of course.

01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,988
It's our song.

01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,660
- Cat, come on, now,
baby. Don't, don't cry.

01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,496
You're gonna ruin your make-up.

01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,134
You look so beautiful tonight.

01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:14,670
- Oh, you mean because
I'm young, Gene?

01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,838
- No.

01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:16,672
No, no.

01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:18,774
The truth is I,

01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,745
I always think you
look beautiful.

01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,348
You were right, Cat.

01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,184
I mean, I, I just
been fooling myself.

01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:33,756
You know, just pretending to
be something that I'm not.

01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,794

01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:43,399

01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,341

This isn't real.

01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:56,211
- Sure it is! Cat,
I, I love you!

01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,646
- I know.

01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,783
You've always loved young,
new, and exciting things, Gene.

01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,785
- Cat, for as long
as you have known me,

01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,321
is that what you think?

01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:07,990
- Just like you loved
that job in Australia.

01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:11,860
- Cat, that was, that
was over 20 years ago!

01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,229
- For you, it was
over 20 years ago.

01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,366
But I have lived with
that job in Australia

01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,235

Sydney.

01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,411
You're still up?

01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,847
- Where have you been?

01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,950
- What do you mean
where have I been?

01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:14,022
- All right, I was worried
about you, Grandma.

01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:17,893
Todd has called, like, 15 times.

01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:21,130
- Oh.

01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,831
- And, you know,
by the last call,

01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,067
he figured you ran
off with Grandpa Gene

01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,603
and just left him
at the Orange Club.

01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,339
- Look. a lot of stuff
has happened tonight-

01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,141
- I'm not finished, Grandma.

01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:40,149
See, um, Todd thinks
you're me, okay?

01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,518
Which pretty much
blows the small chance

01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,320
that I have ever
had at dating him.

01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,825
You know, I really want
to be mad at you, Grandma,

01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:50,826
but I can't.

01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:56,432
- Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

01:13:56,432 --> 01:14:00,002
Look, I know what
you're going through.

01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:03,839
- (scoffs) What makes you
think you understand, huh?

01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,744
Because you've been
17 for two whole days?

01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,712
- I was 17 once
before, young lady.

01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,781
- Yeah, a long
time ago, Grandma.

01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,920
You don't know what
it's like living today,

01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,423
trying to be as
pretty or as thin

01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,992
as these, these models
in these magazines,

01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:27,162
or as hip as these women
in these music videos

01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,298
or trying to live
in this stupid town

01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,166
filled with stupid
little people.

01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,068
No, you don't
understand, Grandma.

01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,436
You don't understand anything.

01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,004
- Okay, you're right.

01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,273
You're right, Sydney. I'm sorry.

01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,808
I shouldn't have
assumed that I knew

01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,376
what was going on inside of you.

01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,780
- Yeah, Grandma, like
that means anything now.

01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,248
I know you're sorry.

01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,150
You're always sorry.

01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,587
And you know what? You always
say things you don't mean.

01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,056
And you know what, Grandma?
I have to say this.

01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:57,125
I really do. You
chased Grandpa away.

01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,360
And you know what?

01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,831
Now, you're chasing Todd
away from me. (huffs)

not giving up on you.

01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,717

be in here somewhere.

01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,175
Look, I don't know what that
was all about last night,

01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,844
but if you and Gene
had something going on

01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,112
at your previous school,

01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,981
which I find very hard
to believe, it's over.

01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,316
- Over.

01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,951
- Look, the rules of this school

01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,020
is that my men are off limits.

01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,289
That includes my brother Todd.

01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,591
Loser girl knows that
and now you do to.

01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,827
- [Friend] You've been warned.

01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,364
- What is her problem?

01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:11,199
- Yeah, and my name's Julie.

01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,036
(bell ringing)

01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,638
You know, just like
an M.P.G.I.S. chick.

01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:17,739
- What the heck is that?

01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,741
- Most popular girl in school.

01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:26,748
(people laughing)
(upbeat hop hop music)

01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,031
I still think that you should
go to the dance tonight,

01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,434
because if you don't,
Ashley will think she won.

01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,769
- Yeah, but I'm not
thinking about Ashley.

01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,339
- But you're
thinking about Todd.

01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,507
Oh, you guys had such
a good time last night,

01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,277
and, well, right up
until you ran out but.

01:16:56,812 --> 01:17:00,816
- Julie, I have to tell
you something, okay?

01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:01,917
Can I trust you?

01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,285
- [Julie] Yes.

01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,053
- Okay, listen.

01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,421
My little brother
accidentally made a formula

01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,656
that makes people young

01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:08,790
and my grandparents
got exposed to it.

01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:09,925
See, now they're our age

01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,193
and that was my
grandmother last night,

01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,694
who looked exactly like
me when she was my age,

01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,696
but now she is my age, so
she looks like my twin.

01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,198
That's who ran out
with Todd last night

01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,499
because she was trying to
make my Grandpa Gene jealous

01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,433
while making out with Todd,

01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,601
only I ran in and saw everything

01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:21,370
and now we're not
speaking to each other.

01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,305
- What?

01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,709
- (sighs) Oprah helped me
find my long lost cousin

01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:28,977
and she was the one

01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:30,412
who ran into the club
last night with Todd.

01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:31,380
Not me.

01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,948
- Oh. Oh!

01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,784
Well, why didn't you
just say that? Jeez.

01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:37,986
Gosh, you know. Oh, my goodness.

01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:39,821
I, what are you gonna do now?

01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,157
- I don't know.

01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,359
I just have to, you know,
get my head together.

01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:50,666
(Sydney sighs)

01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,504
- Julie.

01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,773
- Yeah, that's my name.

01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,208
You guys are identical.

01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,410
That's uncanny.

01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,045
I didn't even need
my tarot cards

01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,113
to tell me that. (chuckles)

01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,115
Well, I think you
guys need to talk,

01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,818
and I'm gonna go, so,
can you lock up for me?

01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,153
- No, no. Julie, I--

01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,320
- Thank you. Bye.

01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:18,060
(Sydney huffs)

01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,661
- Sydney.
- What?

01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,501
- You know, I spent
the entire day

01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,505
sitting in the park
thinking about you.

01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,741
- (scoffs) Please.

01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,909
- And you're right.

01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:38,180
I did chase your
Grandfather away.

01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,717
It was all because of this,

01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,020
this job in, of all
places, Australia.

01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,391
Your grandfather
wanted to go so bad.

01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,260
But I was afraid.

01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,263
New people, new places.

01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,600
I was afraid of a change,

01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,836
but I couldn't tell
him he couldn't go.

01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,007
So I told him he could go alone.

01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,277
And that I'd follow him.

01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,112
- And did you?

01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:16,251
- No.
(Sydney sighs)

01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,319
I never intended to.

01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,823
But I convinced myself
that if he loved me,

01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:22,858
he'd come back.

01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:30,966
And the next thing I know,
I'm, I'm filing for divorce,

01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,668
something that I have
always regretted.

01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,004
- I'm sorry, Grandma.

01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,874
I didn't-
- It's okay.

01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,677
(gentle music)

01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,750
- [Sydney] You still
love him, don't you?

01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,186
- Very much.

01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,556
- Well, Grandma, why
don't you just tell him?

01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,159
- That's what I intended to do.

01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:01,163
But Sydney, everybody's
afraid of new places.

01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,464
- I'm not afraid.

01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,000
- Oh, girl, please.

01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,738
You sound like somebody I
used to know long time ago.

01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:15,177
Someone who let fear
and pride keep them

01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,478
from the one they loved.

01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,614
You remember that
time I told you

01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:22,851
to make this new
experience a positive one?

01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,488
(gentle music)

01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,926
(sighs) I'm afraid I haven't
been taking my own advice.

01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:33,528
- Yeah, but, Grandma,
this, this is different.

01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,329
- Is it?

01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:39,334
Baby, don't make the
same dumb mistake I did.

01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,871
Now, if you like this
boy, you better tell him.

01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,307
- How?

01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:46,441
- At the dance tonight.

01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:54,416
(sighs) Now, let's
go get our men.

01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:00,689
(both laughing)

01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:05,694

(water whooshing)

01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,805
- Come on, Gypsy.

01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,474
(Gypsy whining)

01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,546
- Oh, I got mad love for myself.

01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,481
I just want to jump
back, kiss myself.

01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:27,983
Look at that. Mm.

01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,618
- Can you see any growth?
Can you see any growth?

01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:31,553
- Whatever, y'all.

01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:33,822
Look at me, babe.

01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,056
- [Terrence] Please,
guy, you've got to ask?

01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,625
- Leo] I'm ballin'. I'm
ballin, look at this.

01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,559
- [Terrence] You frontin', guy.

01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,361
- Player.
- Hey.

01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,528
- Player. Oh, my.

01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,232
Oh, my. Why, why?

01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:45,533
- Please, go ahead, brother.

01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,235
- You're doing too
much, my brother.

01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,737
- Dude, what's with this hat?

01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,740
You look like you're from
the 1800s. I don't know what.

01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:55,810
- Look, guys.

01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,982
I've been thinking.

01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:05,153
You know, this life,
it's not for me.

01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:11,826
But I want to thank you guys,
you know, for helping me out.

01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:14,829
It's been fun.

01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,699
- Dude, come on.

01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,368
Lose these frown
lines, will you?

01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,771
We're your boys. For real.

01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:23,872
Together forever.

01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,375
- Ta-da!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,577
I'm never gonna
forget about you two.

01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:30,879
- Well, how could you?

01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,247
Look at us. Come on.
- True dat, true dat.

01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,050
So my man, what are you saying?

01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:35,984
Are you leaving?

01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,721
I mean, you can't
bail on us now.

01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:42,691
We need you for the
hotties to stick around.

01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,093
- That's true, we
do need you, bro.

01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:49,998
- Look, fellas, life is
not all about the hotties.

01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,102
You know, maybe when
you're young, it is.

01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,238
And when you're
young, youth is fine.

01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,877
But there's nothing
wrong with growing up.

01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:07,649
(gentle music)

01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,550
Understand?

01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,221
- Come on, man. Come on.

01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,122
Please, man?

01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:15,223
- [Terrence] Don't go.

01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:17,258
- Hotties, hotties. Hotties.

01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:21,696
- [Terrence] Three of us, we
could get something together.

01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,732
- You heard what I said, okay?

01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,700
I gotta get out of here.

01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,202
Now take care of
yourselves, all right?

01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:30,372
- Take care of yourself.
- Whatever. Whatever.

01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:33,708
(door clicking)

01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:34,909

01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:38,213
Your man got problems.

01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,949
I mean, what the
heck did he mean

01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,817
it ain't all about the hotties?

01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,221
It's all about the hotties.

01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:47,522
- True dat.

01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,257
Bam! That's what
I'm talking about.

hurry up and get to the school

01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,165

01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,447
- [Ashley] (muttering)
Out of my way!

01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:30,151
- Look, Cat, we have to talk.

01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,320
And I'm not taking
no for an answer.

01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,556
- No is the furthest
thing from my mind.

01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,193
♪ I'm curious ♪

01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:47,435
- Maybe you could, um, explain
this to me over a dance?

01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:48,269
- I'd love to.

01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:50,438
- You would?
- Yeah.

01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:54,442
♪ I can't wait
till my tomorrow ♪

01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:59,981
- You know what I've been
thinking about all day?

01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:01,916
- What?

01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,052
- Australia.

01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:10,358
- Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,827
- No, no, no. You were right.

01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:17,365
I mean, I've been
selfish over the years.

01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,733
Only thinking about myself.

01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:25,707
I should have come home instead
of giving you that divorce.

01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,011
- No.

01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,181
I shouldn't have asked for one.

01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,116
I'm sorry.

01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:39,254
- I let you get away, woman.

01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:43,491
I've had to live without
you for 20 years.

01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:47,695
I'm going to let
you know something.

01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,000
I'm never letting you go again.

01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,371
- Neither am I.

01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,375
(Cat gasps)

01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,209
- [Gene] You okay?

01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,611
(Cat groans)

01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:10,184
- I feel like a 67-year-old
woman. (panting)

01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,690
- Cat? Oh my God, Cat.

01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,625
Cat, hey. Hey, baby!

01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,028
Hey, somebody, get some help.

01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,763
- Give her some room.
- Get some help!

01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,231
- Oh, God.
- Somebody call 911.

01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,165
- [Sydney] Grandma?

01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:26,000
- [Gene] Come on, talk to me.

01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,436
What are you doing?
Go get some help, boy!

01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:29,837
- [Todd] Give her some
air, guys, back up.

01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:31,039
- Grandma! Grandma,
are you okay?

01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:31,973
Syd, look, I've got the
antidote right here.

01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,274
We need to get her in a tub

01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:34,676
of some type of
water right away.

01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:35,977
- The pool! The pool,
come on, let's go.

01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,146
- [Julie] Where?

01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,714
- [Gene] Come on,
let's go. Let's go.

01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,015
- Where do you
think you're going?

01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,216
No one walks out on me.

01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:43,951
- Hey, Ashley, this
is not the time.

01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,853
- Yes, it is.

01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:48,489
- Move.
- Or you'll what?

01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:51,259
(blow thuds)
(crowd gasps)

01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:54,195
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:55,763
- [Friend] (gasps)
Player haters!

01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:59,867
- [Sydney] This way, guys.

01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:01,436
- [Willie] Go, Gypsy.

01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,938
(Gypsy barks)

01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:07,675
- All right, what do we do now?

01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:08,976
- Um, here.

01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,312
Okay, I'm gonna throw this in.

01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,751
Okay, now they have to jump in.

01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,455
Syd, it's the only way!

01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:25,159
- [Cat] Whoa, what,
What's happening?

01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,764
- Willie. Willie found a cure.

01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:33,067
This is it.

01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:33,901
We gotta go.

01:29:39,273 --> 01:29:40,808
You gonna come
with me this time?

01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:43,945
- Okay.

01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,817

- [Sydney] Are you
guys all right?

01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:42,703
- It worked.
- Good job, Willie.

01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:43,971
- You weren't kidding

01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,740
about them being your
grandparents, were you?

01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,309
(all laughing)

01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,713
- [Todd] Does this
happen all the time?

01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,715
- [Willie] Watch
out. Come on, Granny.

01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:55,917
- [Sydney] Grandpa, I mean it.

01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,318
- Okay.
- Come on.

(Gene laughing)
(Gypsy barking)

01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:11,265
- We're home!

01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:13,201
- Hey!
- Hey, everyone!

01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:14,035
- Willie!

01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,471
I am your father!

01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:21,042
- Well, what are we supposed
to do, start a parade?

01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,312
(Gene and Cat laughing)

01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:27,548
Oh, go on. Stop it, you
old fool. (laughing)

01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:30,251
- Mom, Dad, are you guys okay?

01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,085
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:31,919
- Sure.

01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:36,057
- We have got to let
your parents watch
the kids more often.

01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:37,525
- Hmm.

01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,895
- Dad? They named
the baby Brett.

01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:42,597
- Brett?

01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,399
Well, what happened to Gene?

01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,668
- I like the name Gene.

01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:50,304
- And I love the name Catherine.

01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:51,873
- Mm.
(both laughing)

01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:55,476
- Hey, honey. Uh, what's been
going on since, uh, we left?

01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:56,444
Can you fill me in?

01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,148
- Life, Dad. Just life.

01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,619
- Everybody, I have an
announcement to make.

01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:10,191
How would you feel about
a wedding in the spring?

01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:15,496
- Oh, sugar, honey,
iced tea, Gene Donovan.

01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,367
Are you saying what I
think you're saying?

01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:22,837
(gentle music)

01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:24,205
- Will you marry me, again?

01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:30,044
- Oh, Gene, I can't think
of anything I'd rather do

01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,547
then spend the rest
of my life with you.

01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,381
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,117
- Oh!

01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:37,818
Oh, congratulations.

01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:41,889
Oh, okay, I have got to
plan this whole wedding.

01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,124
Okay, first of all,

01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,492
I'm gonna have to
call Reverend Smith.

01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:45,726
And the florist on 34th.

01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:48,129
And Darlene is gonna
have to do your dress.

01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:50,631
Oh, you're going to look
so beautiful in white!

01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:51,432
- [All] White?

01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:54,502
- Peach?

01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:56,304
- Peach is good.

01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,805
- [Gene] Yes. Much better.

01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:02,143
- Monique. Um, I have an idea.

01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:04,345
Why don't I help you
with the wedding plans?

01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:08,783
- Oh, Sydney. (laughs)
I'd love that.

01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,552
(both giggling)

01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,286
- [Barry] I think I'm gonna
go upstairs and unpack.

01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:13,120
- Okay.

01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:16,090
- Your son is in shock.
- The boy is out.

01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,926
(both laughing)

01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:19,760
- See?

01:33:21,162 --> 01:33:22,863
You know what it's all about.

01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:25,933

01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:31,439

01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:33,708
- Is it Todd?

01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,009
- Wait, can you hold
on for a second?

01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,243
Thank you.

01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:37,411
It's for Dad.

01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,080
Dad, telephone!

01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:44,018

son. I'm in the shower.
