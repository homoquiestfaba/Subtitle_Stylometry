00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,672
The Honourable Alan Dee
and former Mrs Easton.

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,469
The Honourable William
and Mrs Breslow.

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,917

Ladies and gentlemen,

and Mrs Bush.

6
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,269
How is everybody?
Everybody's here! Look!

7
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,112
Hi, Peter.

8
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,839
Jack, glad you could make it.
Bill, hi.

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,993
Get rid of the beard. Too liberal.
Hi, Frank. Trudy.

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,875
Hi, Peter.
Glad you could make it.

11
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
Everybody's here tonight.

12
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,116
Thank you very much.
Dr Meinheimer, glad you made it, sir.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,592
Here she is.

14
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,793
Thank you.

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,636
Easy, watch her head!

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,350
- How are you, dear?
- I’m OK.

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,754
Good. Please be seated.

18
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,593
Welcome. Glad you could all come.

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,989
I’m pleased to see we're graced

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,039
with the presence of
so many distinguished guests tonight.

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,069
This week we're celebrating Law
Enforcement Week across the country.

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,109
I’d like to turn the proceedings over
to our own DC Police Commissioner,

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,998
Captain Annabel Brumford.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,468
l wish to introduce a distinguished
American, who this week is honoured

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,279
for his 1,000th drug dealer killed.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,397
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,471
Lieutenant Frank Drebin
of Police Squad.

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,429
Er, in all honesty, the last two
l backed over with my car.

29
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,354
Luckily, they turned out
to be drug dealers.

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,998
Er, thank you, Commissioner.

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,269
Now my Chief of Staff, John Sununu,
will introduce some special guests.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,634
Thank you.

33
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,670
I’m very proud to welcome our guests
from the nation's energy suppliers.

34
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,550
First, head of the Society
of Petroleum industry Leaders -

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,278
better known as SPIL -

36
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,191
Mr Terence Baggett.

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,235
Now, chairman of the Society
for More Coal Energy, or SMOCE,

38
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,756
- Mr Donald Fenwick.
- Thank you very much.

39
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,159
And president of the Key Atomic
Benefits Office Of Mankind - KABOOM,

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,708
Mr Arthur Dunwell.

41
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,314
For the past three years,

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,313
this administration has tried to
formulate a national energy policy,

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,838
one with a lasting impact
on the next decade and beyond.

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,957
To ensure we choose the right path,

45
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,556
the President has appointed
as his top advisor in this area...

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,108
Dr Albert S Meinheimer.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,349
As I’m sure you're aware
his reputation is without peer,

48
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,318
and Dr Meinheimer
will present his recommendations

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,039
to the annual national
press club dinner...

50
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,073
Mr President...

51
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,910
l want you all
to be the first to know

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,439
that l am basing my administration's
entire energy policy

53
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,114
on Dr Meinheimer's recommendations.

54
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,469
This issue's too important for
politicians with special interests.

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,270
Rather we need an independent source
on which to base our future actions,

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,399
and Meinheimer is the recognised
expert in this field.

57
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,435
Mr President...

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,838
lf l may say so,

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,912
l do hope that Dr Meinheimer

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,030
won't be influen...influenced
by the so-called environmentalists.

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,953
We're well aware of his reputation.

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,749
l think HE should
explain his research.

63
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,629
Doctor?

64
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
This happens every fucking time
l go shopping!

65
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,109
- Jane?
- Oh, Dr Meinheimer!

66
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,398
- You're back early.
- And you're here late.

67
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,554
Surely a lovely young woman like you
has better things to do on Saturdays?

68
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,151
Oh, I’m sorry, my dear.
l didn't mean to be so blunt.

69
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,800
it’s all right, Doctor. it’s OK.

70
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,117
Are you thinking about him again?
What was his name...Frank?

71
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,918
Yes.

72
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,514
You can't forget him, can you?

73
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,034
- Who?
- Frank.

74
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,439
Oh, yes!

75
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,556
No, l can't.

76
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,996
l try. it’s just that...

77
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,272
when you've had that much man...

78
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,830
But then, you wouldn't understand.

79
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,389
Jane, look!
You mustn't be so hard on yourself.

80
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,109
You've done a wonderful job
here at the institute.

81
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,351
You're the finest director
of public relations we've had.

82
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,352
Thank you, Doctor. l try my best.

83
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,479
But l see you here
night after night past ten.

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,918
You've got to forget about the past.
See new people! Enjoy yourself!

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,233
There is someone I’m seeing. We've
been talking about your speech...

86
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,629
Good evening, Miss Spencer...
Dr Meinheimer.

87
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,631
Hello, Norm.

88
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,473
Oh! How was the White House dinner?

89
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,675
Extraordinary!

90
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,116
The President promised to implement
whatever recommendations l make.

91
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,474
That's wonderful!

92
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,553
- Then you'll deliver the speech?
- Yes.

93
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,634
l would have tonight but one guest
made such a ruckus, it was useless.

94
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,269
Hey, Al, Kent, look at this!

95
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,794
Found this in the wastebasket.

96
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,234
That's a pretty nice clock!
Wonder why they threw it out?

97
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,598
it’s four minutes slow!
Let me fix it.

98
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,189
There!

99
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,995
My name is Sergeant Frank Drebin,
Detective Lieutenant, Police Squad.

100
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,870
l was just having my car washed,
when l heard the call.

101
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,589
There'd been a bombing downtown. l
was on my way to advise the DC police

102
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,389
as part of the President's
Operation Scum Round-up.

103
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,594
Every once in a while something
comes up that you can't prepare for.

104
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,148
Some crazed madman,

105
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,314
full of self-hate -
and possibly behind in his rent -

106
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,039
finally snapped.

107
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,477
- Glad you could make it.
- Got here as quick as l could.

108
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,790
Congratulations on Edna's pregnancy!

109
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,235
Yes, and if l catch the guy...!

110
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,270
Captain, there's no sign of
a break-in. Man, what an explosion!

111
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,158
Still trying to figure out
what they used.

112
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,199
- Any other victims?
- You're standing on one.

113
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,510
Get him outt a here.

114
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,955
This one's a real mess!

115
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,589
Hey, everybody!
Frank found another one!

116
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,592
- Any witnesses?
- One, a woman.

117
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,319
She saw a man leaving
just before the blast.

118
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,436
Should we let Nordberg handle this?

119
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,795
No. I’ll do it while it's fresh.

120
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,318
Not now! She took a nasty knock
on the head. She looks pretty bad!

121
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,198
I’ll handle it. Excuse me, miss.

122
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,636
- l have some questions.
- Not THATbad, Frank!

123
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,837
She's being questioned over there.

124
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,832
l couldn't believe it was her.

125
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,199
it was like a dream. But there
she was, just as l remembered her.

126
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,113
That delicately beautiful face.

127
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,432
A body that could melt a cheese
sandwich from across the room.

128
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,513
And breasts that seemed to say...

129
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,795
''Hey! Look at these!''

130
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,434
She made you want to drop
to your knees

131
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,195
and thank God you were a man!

132
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,070
She reminded me of my mother,
all right. No doubt about it.

133
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,112
Stop looking at her like she was
your mother, for Christ's sake!

134
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,359
Frank!

135
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,072
- Jane, l didn't know you lived here.
- l moved here two years ago.

136
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,756
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any.

137
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,592
Oh, yes!

138
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,596
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine. Good as new. Even better!

139
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,710
l know it's hard, but are you still
obsessed with our relationship?

140
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,920
Obsessed?! Just because you backed
out of the wedding two years ago?!

141
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,514
it’s ancient history,
like the Democrats.

142
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,275
- Frank?
- He was in tears at the church.

143
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,554
Get a grip!

144
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,995
- l returned 13 Cuisinarts!
- Enough.

145
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,072
- l kept the salad shooter, though.
- Jane!

146
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,957
Hello, Jane.

147
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,192
- This is Dr Albert Meinheimer.
- Don't get up.

148
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,078
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I’m sure.

149
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,913
But, we've met -
at the White House dinner?

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,436
He has a photographic memory.

151
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,718
This is a terrible thing.
l hope you find those responsible.

152
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,475
I’m sorry,
but we have a long road ahead of us.

153
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,475
Like having sex, it's an arduous
task that goes on forever

154
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,711
and just when it's going your way,
nothing happens!

155
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,396
Jane. About this man from last night?
Anything can help.

156
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,232
l've given a description.

157
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,553
Ed!

158
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,995
That'll be all, Mc Tigue.

159
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,719
Let's get that other artist.
The one who never dates.

160
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,234
- Lives with those two guys.
- Right.

161
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,869
I’d like to see
the rest of the institute now.

162
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,758
- Let's start with the research area.
- Good idea. This way.

163
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,911
- And the man you saw last night?
- He's Caucasian.

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,434
- Caucasian?
- Yeah. White guy.

165
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,308
- Moustache. About six foot three.
- Awfully big moustache!

166
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,109
- What's this?
- This is our research lab.

167
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,990
All experiments are controlled
by these machines below.

168
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,310
Our scientists have spent years
on experiments

169
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,789
and are just now making
breakthroughs.

170
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,915
Oh, my God!

171
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,959
Thank heavens the bomb
didn't damage the research area.

172
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,316
- Who'd want to do such a thing?
- Er, Jane.

173
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,756
- You should know about something.
- Jane, darling!

174
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,875
Quentin!

175
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,839
Jane, are you all right?
l was so worried about you.

176
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
I’m OK. But I’m glad you're here.

177
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,838
Oh, sorry! This is Quentin Hapsburg
of Hexagon Oil.

178
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,239
A pleasure, Mr...?

179
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,791
Drebin. Frank Drebin.
l've used some of your rest rooms.

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,273
I’m...sure you have.

181
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,316
Are you connected to the institute?

182
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,918
Well, not officially, but Jane and l
have seen each other a lot lately.

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,991
My little hell-cat!

184
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,839
Well...great. l've been dating too -
a nice girl, an author.

185
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,151
She writes about male sexual
problems. You probably know her.

186
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,390
- l beg your pardon!
- Frank!

187
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,430
OK. Let's handle this maturely, just
like the responsible adults we are.

188
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,397
OK, Mr Poopy-Pants?!

189
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,391
- That does it!
- Frank!

190
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,675
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us?

191
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,354
Anything you wish, my darling.

192
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,956
Until tonight, then.

193
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,438
I’m feelin' blue

194
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,918
Just thinkin' of you

195
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,278
l get out of bed

196
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,194
Wish l was dead

197
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,759
And l hope you do, too

198
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,439
So l have given up

199
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,877
l've thrown in the towel

200
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,354
l've taken all the pills

201
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,195
The law will allow

202
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,554
And so I’m feelin' blue...

203
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,595
Sir?

204
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,758
Gimme the strongest thing you got.

205
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,399
On second thoughts,
how about a Black Russian?

206
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,993
Very well.

207
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,312
l guess I’m just...

208
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,793
screwed...

209
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,995
Frank.

210
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,675
- l thought I’d find you here.
- Ed. Sit down.

211
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,716
Pull up a memory or two.

212
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,473
You left before l could talk to you.

213
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,839
is it my imagination
or is the whole world crazy?

214
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,196
No, it's just a small
percentage of the population.

215
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,674
l hope you're right.
But do l fit any more?

216
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,275
You're still thinking about Jane,
aren't you?

217
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,797
She's part of my life,
always will be. l can't forget her.

218
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,796
But it's done. Minute l heard her
say, ''Get outta my life'', l knew it.

219
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,869
You know,
sometimes l envy you and Edna.

220
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,397
You have the same person
every day for over 30 years.

221
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,870
You wake up, eat with her,
sleep with her.

222
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,349
Make love to the same woman.

223
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,673
You spend every possible
waking moment together,

224
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,788
while I’m out running around
with 20-year-olds who want cheap sex.

225
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,954
Girls who can't say no. Girls who
can't get enough. ''More, more, more.

226
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,600
''Your turn to wear the handcuffs...''

227
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,277
- l... l just wanna love, Ed.
- I’m sure you'll find love.

228
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,909
- l already have one.
- it’s from the lady.

229
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,558
Go to her.

230
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,390
Go on. I’ll see you in the morning.

231
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,674
Excuse me.

232
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,034
Pardon me.

233
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,354
Sorry.

234
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,080
This is not easy to say. I’m lonely.
I’m lost. l need someone to hold.

235
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,115
Frank.

236
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,959
Over here.

237
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,315
Well...

238
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,990
What are you doing here?

239
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,833
l called your hotel
and got no answer.

240
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,756
- l thought maybe you'd be here.
- Good evening, Sam.

241
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,233
Mr Drebin! Jane!
Always nice to see nice people.

242
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,072
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.

243
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,718
Of course.

244
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,079
Sam! That's enough!
Play the other one.

245
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,678
You can't let ghosts die, can you?
You walk out on me. No explanation.

246
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,832
- Didn't you get my letters?
- Every one.

247
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,639
Tore 'em up. Threw them in the fire.

248
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,475
So you didn't get the $75,000
your uncle left you?

249
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,879
Why are you here?

250
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,069
l remembered that last night l saw
a red van parked across the street.

251
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,553
Red van? That'll be very helpful.
That's it. So you can go now, right?

252
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,837
That's not my only reason
for being here.

253
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,071
- l want us to be friends.
- Sure. Friends.

254
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,789
l bet if l dusted you for prints,
they'd be Hapsburg's.

255
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,313
You...!

256
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,631
So this kitten
still knows how to scratch!

257
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,232
Sorry. l shouldn't have done that.

258
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,555
Frank, we're no good together.

259
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,316
- You only lived for police work.
- You lived for the N-zone layer!

260
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,949
Ozone layer!
You never did understand.

261
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,190
How can you say that,

262
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,989
when l bought
1,000 acres of Brazilian jungle,

263
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,959
then had it slashed and burned
to build our dream-house?

264
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,792
You're so insensitive!

265
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,557
insensitive?! You think it's easy
displacing an entire tribe? You try!

266
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,791
I’d better go! This was a mistake.

267
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,919
l was hoping you'd be happy,
that you'd have someone!

268
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,911
I’m single!

269
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,150
l love being single!

270
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,518
l haven't had this much sex
since l was a Scout leader.

271
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,949
At the time, l was dating a lot.

272
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,119
l told you
the bombing wouldn't work!

273
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,112
We had no choice. Look at the paper!

274
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,512
''President to give Meinheimer
blank cheque at press club dinner.''

275
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,750
That's in two days!

276
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,751
- l know!
- We all do.

277
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,628
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

278
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,633
l know you're all worried,
and l agree -

279
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,393
there's plenty to be worried about.

280
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,233
Like this solar power plant.

281
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,198
Already operational
outside Los Angeles.

282
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,919
Photo-voltaic cells.

283
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,357
They convert sunlight directly
into electricity. Fluorescent -

284
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,560
lasts much longer than a conventional
bulb, using a quarter of the power.

285
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,316
Super windows - insulate as well
as ten sheets of glass.

286
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,076
An electric car -
partially powered by solar panels.

287
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,072
But the truth is, gentlemen,

288
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,630
I’m not worried
about any of these things.

289
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,952
Because no one's ever
going to know about them.

290
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,315
What about Meinheimer
and his report?

291
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,516
He's going to tell the President.

292
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,956
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?

293
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,072
That's kidnapping!

294
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,391
- Heavens!
- What about the speech?

295
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,790
Dr Meinheimer
Will deliver his speech.

296
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,871
it is my view,

297
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,317
we must rely on coal,
oil and nuclear energy.

298
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,597
- OUR Dr Meinheimer.
- Oh, my God!

299
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,038
Gentlemen,

300
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,076
meet Earl Hacker,

301
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,358
former Arts consultant
to Jesse Helms.

302
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,991
As l explained to Hapsburg,
my fee is one million.

303
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,153
And, might l add,
I’m worth every penny.

304
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,710
But you gentlemen
don't have any choice...

305
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,954
..do ya! Ha, ha!

306
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,952
After getting a good night's sleep,
l decided to head back to HQ.

307
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,713
l figured,
if l buried myself in work,

308
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,272
l could forget about Jane and catch
a killer before he struck again.

309
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,196
So far we had few clues. l hoped
the lab boys had found something.

310
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,589
Hey, shut that thing off!

311
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,355
Now, pigs, say your prayers!

312
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,311
- Nice work, Frank.
- What?

313
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,631
Ted, show us those lab results
from the institute.

314
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,477
We couldn't get any clean prints.
But we did find footprints outside.

315
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,074
We made plaster casts out of them.

316
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,470
Size 91/2 D.
We're running a trace now.

317
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,118
Even more interesting,

318
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,433
we found this dinosaur footprint
from the Paleolithic era.

319
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,953
Anything else?

320
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,273
We also found ancient timbers
we believe may be from Noah's Ark.

321
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,157
But about the case...?

322
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,870
I’m departing tomorrow to speak
to the Archaeological Society.

323
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,633
And I’m on ''Geraldo'' next week.

324
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,280
You're on ''Geraldo'' because of this?

325
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,716
No. My wife's a transsexual
Satan-worshipper.

326
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,033
We'll continue print analysis,
fibre checks, DNA breakdown,

327
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,953
and using the dirt particles
on this footprint...

328
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,318
it’s a matter of getting
a geologic breakdown of the city.

329
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,994
We may not have that kind of time.

330
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,638
Then maybe this'll help.

331
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,316
We found this wallet
outside the institute.

332
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,520
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
it just came down from the lab.

333
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,118
Hector Savage. From Detroit.
Hey, l remember this punk. Ex-box er.

334
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,355
- His real name was Joey Chicago.
- Yeah. He fought as Kid Minneapolis.

335
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,477
l saw him fight once in Cincinnati.

336
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,028
No, that's Kid New York, in Philly.

337
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,830
Killed in Houston, by Tex Colorado -
The Arizona Assassin.

338
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,673
Yeah! From Dakota!
Was it North or South?

339
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,389
South Dakota was his brother,
from West Virginia.

340
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,754
You know your boxing!

341
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,753
All l know is never
bet on the white guy.

342
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,671
You got an address there?

343
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,709
All l got is a card that says
''Monique DiCarlo, 210 Bleckman St.''

344
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,157
The red light district.
Why's Savage hanging out down there?

345
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,196
- Sex, Frank?
- Er...

346
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,034
No, not right now Ed.
We've got work to do.

347
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,154
The address we were given for
Monique DiCarlo was in Little ltaly.

348
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,109
We proceeded there, hoping
it would lead us to Hector Savage.

349
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,590
And to a clue to break
the case wide open.

350
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,475
it’s the cops!
You gotta get rid of 'em!

351
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,111
I’ll handle it. Quick!
You'll be safe in the basement.

352
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,151
- Ed.
- Frank?

353
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,912
- Red van.
- l know.

354
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,198
Jane said she saw a red van
outside the institute that night.

355
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,158
- Let's take him!
- No. He's not working alone.

356
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,152
Let's bug it and see where he goes.

357
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,710
- Good thinking, Frank. Nordberg!
- No problem!

358
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,115
Lieutenant Frank Drebin.
This is my captain.

359
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,875
- is this some kind of bust?
- Well, it's very impressive,

360
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,952
but we have some questions.

361
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,229
All right, listen! We're looking for
a Hector Savage. Now, where is he?

362
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,675
Why should l tell you, copper?

363
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,754
I’m the last line of defence between
this dirt and the decent people.

364
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,114
Hi, Frank.

365
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,832
We got that D83 Swedish
suck machine that you ordered.

366
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,075
A gift.

367
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,189
Frank! Come here! Quick!

368
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,917
it’s Savage! He's moving.

369
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,590
Hey! Stop! Stop!
I’m a police officer!

370
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,957
Let's go, Ed. And remember,
we can't let him spot us.

371
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,758
Pull over!

372
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,592
Nordberg's bug is on the money!

373
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,357
He's changing direction.
Stop the car.

374
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,919
- He's closing.
- Any time now.

375
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,353
Keep your eyes peeled.

376
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,076
He's real close now!

377
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,196
Step on it!

378
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,192
Help! Stop! Stop!

379
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,191
Frank, stop!

380
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,430
Stop right now!

381
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,033
l said stop!

382
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,916
Help! Help!

383
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,950
- Frank Drebin. What do we have here?
- Tense situation.

384
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,635
Savage is in that house.
Says he's got hostages.

385
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,869
Could be bluffing.

386
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
- Anything else?
- Yeah. That red van...

387
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,070
it’s registered
to one Quentin Hapsburg.

388
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,353
Well.

389
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,514
Looks like the cows have come home
to roost. How ya doin', trooper?

390
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,357
Hey! Stop firing!

391
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,112
Hold it! Stop firing!

392
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,711
Stop firing!

393
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,751
Stop firing!

394
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,832
All right. Give me the bull horn.

395
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,071
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.

396
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,358
Throw down your guns,
and come on out with your hands up.

397
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,434
Or come on out, then throw down your
guns, whichever way you wanna do it.

398
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,080
Just remember the two key elements.

399
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,232
One - guns down. Two - come on out.

400
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,629
You just try and take me!

401
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,472
l got more!

402
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,915
Looks like he's holding
all the cards.

403
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,991
Not all the cards, Ed.

404
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,117
You're not permitted
to drive that tank!

405
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,237
Don't worry, Ed. Just keep him busy.

406
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,278
All right, Savage. What do you want?

407
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,194
l want a car. Something fun.
A Porsche.

408
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,955
A plane ticket to Jamaica,
and a nice hotel.

409
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,750
No touristy place. Something
really indicative of the culture.

410
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,035
Can't do that, Savage.

411
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,911
We're calling your bluff. Put your
hands on your head and come out.

412
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,918
Frank, what are you doing?
Where are you going? Frank!

413
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,754
Frank! Help!

414
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,075
- Your coat, sir?
- Yes, it is.

415
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,311
And l have a receipt to prove it.

416
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,272
Telephone, Commissioner.

417
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,033
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

418
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,073
Yes?

419
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,957
He did what?

420
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,600
How many animals escaped?

421
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,795
Oh, my God!

422
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,997
Evening, Commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.

423
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,150
Do you realise that because of you
this city is overrun by baboons?

424
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,869
isn’t that the fault
of the voters? Excuse me.

425
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,792
I’d just like to thank you all
for attending this event

426
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,034
in honour of Dr Meinheimer who will
make his historic address tomorrow.

427
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,795
And along with the President,

428
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,270
l, too, pledge to support
Dr Meinheimer's recommendations,

429
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,476
whatever they may be.

430
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,596
- And now, please enjoy the evening.
- Oh, there's someone l know.

431
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,114
May l cut in?

432
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,590
- Frank! Why are you here?
- l enjoy a good party.

433
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,355
- Why, really?
- l can sum that up in three words.

434
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,715
Quentin Hapsburg.

435
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,920
l never liked him. He's as dirty
as a miner's underwear in January.

436
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,558
What's gotten into you?

437
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,714
He's a gentle, concerned man who's
not as suspicious as some people!

438
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,949
Oh, yeah!

439
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,795
Why not ask him what his connection
is to that red van you saw?

440
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,668
l don't know what
you're talking about.

441
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,672
Ask him about a two-bit goon
called Savage.

442
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,795
Stop it!

443
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,396
You're jealous because he can
understand me like you never could.

444
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,314
l know he'll be jealous
if he's watching now.

445
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,115
And a jealous man always makes the
wrong moves. I’m counting on that.

446
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,196
Mr Drebin, sir, Mr Hapsburg
would like you to join him.

447
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,669
Solitaire's a lonely man's game,
Hapsburg.

448
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,398
Lieutenant.

449
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,716
l don't recall your name
on the guest list.

450
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,236
That's OK. l sometimes
go by my maiden name.

451
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,590
it’s a nice party, Hapsburg.
l see a lot of familiar face-lifts.

452
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,110
Do you gamble?

453
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,316
Every time l order out.

454
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,152
You do speak French?

455
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,074
Unfortunately, no.
But l do kiss that way.

456
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,039
- You're in my place!
- Doctor!

457
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,749
- You remember Frank?
- Oh! Mr...um...?

458
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,277
Drebin, from Police Squad.
You met him at the institute.

459
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,193
Oh, yes. Do sit down.

460
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,273
No, thank you, l don't intend
to stay. Let's play another game.

461
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,952
Who's this?

462
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,279
l don't know.

463
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,514
He blew up a building.
His van is registered in your name.

464
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,515
We own lots of vans. One of them was
stolen not more than three days ago.

465
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,956
- l have nothing to hide.
- Maybe so.

466
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,636
But l warn you, so much as sneeze
and I’ll be there to wipe your nose.

467
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,629
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
the first draw prize of the evening -

468
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,838
an all-expense-paid trip
to the Gilligan islands.

469
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,516
To draw the winner, we would like
to ask our guest of honour,

470
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,795
Dr Albert S Meinheimer.

471
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,798
- Let me help you. No...
- No trouble.

472
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,599
l don't know what's got into Frank.

473
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,752
Merely a case of jealousy, my dear.

474
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,712
He seems to get
around marvellously.

475
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,750
Jane, l just wanna tell you
that I’m sorry about what happened.

476
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,719
- Oh, Frank.
- l need to talk to you. May l?

477
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,194
Well, the place is kind of a mess.
And l was gonna make a shake.

478
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,510
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

479
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,195
Are you sure? I’m trying out
a new recipe tonight.

480
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,231
Jane, what is Dr Meinheimer
going to say at the dinner tomorrow?

481
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,916
He will endorse energy efficiency
and renewable energy - solar power.

482
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,754
- Who else knew that?
- Only me. Oh! And Quentin.

483
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,870
And if the President supported
energy efficiency, who'd lose out?

484
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,679
Well, coal, oil and nuclear.

485
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,919
Jane, just one more question.

486
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,754
You told me that Dr Meinheimer
had a photographic memory,

487
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,719
yet tonight
he never recalled meeting me.

488
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,076
That's strange,
but he's been under stress.

489
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,116
Does he have any identifying marks?

490
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,832
A scar, a mole, webbed toes,
a third nostril?

491
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,674
He has a mole shaped like Whistler's
Mother on his right buttock.

492
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,876
l see.

493
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,520
Have you noticed anything different?

494
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,353
Well, only that he's a foot taller.

495
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,874
And he seems to be left-handed now.

496
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,520
What are you trying to tell me?

497
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,717
That Quentin
has found a double for Meinheimer

498
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,837
who'll give a fraudulent
report tomorrow?

499
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,558
That's brilliant!

500
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,029
That's a lot better than my idea.

501
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,954
Stop it! it’s crazy!
is there no end to your jealousy?

502
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,473
You're hurting me!

503
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,075
- What more do you want?
- Use your phone?

504
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,832
- Local call?
- Yes.

505
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,310
Right. Excuse me,
I’m gonna take a shower.

506
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,791
The phone is in the other room. Bye.

507
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,238
Gimme Captain Ed Hocken, please.

508
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,031
Ed, I’m on to something big.
l need you and Nordberg tomorrow.

509
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,554
What's he doing in Detroit?

510
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,393
Send him a ticket and clean pants.

511
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,750
Just as l suspected.

512
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,715
Come on! On your feet!

513
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,191
Where's the water pressure?

514
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,118
Oh, l was so frightened!

515
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,596
What happened out there?

516
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,516
it’s nothing. But l wouldn't leave
till they've shampooed the carpets.

517
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,318
Who'd want to kill you?

518
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,039
Before tonight,
only the cable company.

519
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,591
I’m afraid it's one of Hapsburg's
goons. He was carrying this.

520
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,638
Hapsburg Valdez?!

521
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,153
l feel like such a fool.
l should have never doubted you.

522
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,276
There, there.

523
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,196
You couldn't know you were dating
a vicious, murdering sociopath.

524
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,589
We have to help Dr Meinheimer.

525
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,831
Yes. They'll torture and kill him.

526
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,798
it’s all my fault.

527
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,237
They'll start by tearing out his
toe nails, then on to nose hairs.

528
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,151
What are we gonna do?

529
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,869
lf my hunch is right,
they've got him hostage here.

530
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,916
At the Home Club?

531
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,479
No.

532
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,155
At this warehouse.
l gotta get going to rescue him.

533
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,673
Oh, you be careful!

534
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,035
Of course, l...

535
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,150
l will, er...

536
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,834
l guess I’d better be on my way.

537
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,277
l promised Nordberg
we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.

538
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,118
Oh, l can't fight it any more!

539
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,718
l ran away from you once. l can't
do it again. Stay with me. Please?

540
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,076
Frank, I’m telling ya.
We've got no business doing this.

541
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,515
All we've got is a dock pass
and your hunch.

542
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,674
Hapsburg is up to something, right
up to his important shirt collar.

543
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,794
Couldn't have picked a better day.

544
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,031
This fog will keep us concealed.

545
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,032
That's not fog. The engine's on fire.

546
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,556
All right. Let's run through
this one more time.

547
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,838
At 3:15, Nordberg cuts the power
and kills the alarms.

548
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,148
Right.

549
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,231
- Nordberg!
- Yeah, got it!

550
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,392
I’ll wait for the signal.
You wired up?

551
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,072
Yeah. Right.

552
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,473
Now, when you hear me say,
''l love it'', you guys move in.

553
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,118
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?

554
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,433
The water's over there, Frank.

555
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,873
Hexagon Oil Commercial, number one.

556
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,438
Piloting today's oil tankers
is a big responsibility.

557
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,036
And that's why, here at
Hexagon's Captain Training School,

558
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,635
future captains go through
a rigorous instruction rogramme.

559
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,111
By a complicated process,
we weed out those less qualified

560
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,354
for the day-to-day operation
of a half-million tonne supertanker.

561
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,719
Only the best will take command
of a floating ecological time bomb.

562
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,439
Commercial two.

563
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,269
Ah, just the way l like it.

564
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,151
Hey, someday in the future, the sun
may provide all our energy needs.

565
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,392
But right now it gives
us a comfortable feeling,

566
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,632
to know our home is supplied
by nuclear power.

567
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,635
l know what you're thinking,
but we know nuclear energy is safe.

568
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,713
We kinda think of it as
our friendly neighbour.

569
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,634
But our friend can't exist
without huge subsidies.

570
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,111
So write your congressman, tell him
to keep those dollars rolling into...

571
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,519
nuclear power.

572
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,954
l've got to find another way in, Ed.

573
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,237
They got killer guard dogs here,
do you read me?

574
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,469
Loud and clear.

575
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,714
- Nordberg? How we doing?
- We're at our destination.

576
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,790
I’m gonna try the roof.

577
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,110
I’m gonna try it again.

578
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,790
- Cut the power.
- Right.

579
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,672
Help!

580
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,273
Come in?

581
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,715
Frank, hold on. We have a problem.

582
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,553
Well...

583
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,756
it's Lieutenant Drebin.

584
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,594
You were supposed to have been
killed last night.

585
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,995
Now l think I’m gonna
enjoy doing it myself.

586
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,231
it’ll be slow and painful.

587
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,078
What's that smell?

588
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,392
That would be me.
l've been swimming in raw sewage.

589
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,198
l love it.

590
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,839
l love it!

591
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,753
That's the signal. Let's go!

592
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,309
it’s stuck. Gimme a hand.

593
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,960
Ed, help me!

594
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,234
Search him.

595
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,118
l love it.

596
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,913
He's wired.

597
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,714
Tie him up.

598
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,713
You'll never get away with this,
Hapsburg.

599
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,756
Whatever it is.

600
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,992
All right, I’ll show you.
Let me introduce you to some people.

601
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,868
Of course, you know Dr Meinheimer.

602
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,478
And Earl Hacker.

603
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,552
Why you son of a...

604
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,598
And I’d like you to meet the Redmans.

605
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,195
Weekend guests from out of town.

606
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,559
We're going to the dinner. Make sure
nothing happens to him till l return.

607
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,674
Then l want the pleasure
of killing you myself.

608
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,069
The pleasure is all mine.

609
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,157
See you after the speech, Lieutenant.

610
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,875
Police!

611
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,473
Freeze!

612
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,198
Over there!

613
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,993
Good Lord!

614
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,629
Look at what they did
to Dr Meinheimer.

615
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,756
You OK, Doctor Meinheimer?

616
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,874
That's OK. Don't try to talk.

617
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,194
l just can't take this any more.

618
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,317
Garbage like you
just makes me sick!

619
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,675
Ed?

620
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,356
I’m just John Q Public now.
it’s just you and me.

621
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,718
Mano a mano. I’ll teach you
to pick on an invalid.

622
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,910
All right! He's had enough.

623
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,310
Help the Captain.
Let's get to that dinner.

624
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,236
Mr Sununu?

625
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,949
There'll be no surprises
in the address.

626
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,873
Most likely he'll recommend
the President continue our policy

627
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,670
of oil dependency and more dollars
for subsidising nuclear power.

628
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:10,153
More later. Also, an update on the
escaped zoo animals terrorising...

629
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,109
This is the most important evening
in my career. No mistakes!

630
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,637
And if you see Drebin or his squad,
arrest them on sight!

631
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,874
l told Jane to meet us
at the hotel's rear entrance.

632
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,915
Where's that?

633
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,709
in the back. She's gonna unlock
the doors at 7.30 sharp.

634
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,153
And Hapsburg?

635
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,438
l just hope she can steer
clear of him. Let's go.

636
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,196
Why, Jane!

637
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,795
What are you doing out here?
The party's inside.

638
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,711
Oh, Quentin!

639
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,271
l was just getting a breath
of fresh air.

640
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,395
l grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.

641
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,436
I’m sure.

642
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,991
But how fortunate to find you.
You can join me at my table.

643
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,958
- Something must have happened.
- Hey, Bernardo! The keys?

644
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,599
l have a better idea. Follow me.

645
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,712
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen...

646
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,598
A thousand points of...light! Light.

647
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,515
Recession - bad. Recovery - good.
Think l got that.

648
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:55,072
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

649
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,599
l think we'd better make our move.

650
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,071
You're right. Something more up
tempo, like ''Guantanamera''.

651
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,639
No!

652
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,029
Hacker and the speech!

653
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:10,433
Right! I’ll intercept Hacker.
Get the doc ready for His speech.

654
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,314
Bravo!

655
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,789
Encore! Encore!

656
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,236
- Dr Meinheimer!
- Yes?

657
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,673
Or should l say...

658
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,159
Hacker?

659
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,878
Drebin! Agh!

660
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,792
Look what he's doing to that invalid!
Can't someone help?

661
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,154
Yeah!

662
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,958
Let's get him!

663
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,920
We'd better get this man first aid.

664
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:09,111
Thank you. I’m pleased and honoured
to be here at this historic event.

665
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,752
Tonight, Dr Albert Meinheimer,
as he looks up to the future,

666
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:21,234
has realised how our dependence on
foreign oil is strangling the budget.

667
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,872
Cuts have to be made, and some
people are gonna be hit hard.

668
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,714
But we'll cut till we have an impact.

669
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,475
it’s the only way to move forward.

670
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,758
l present to you,
Dr Albert S Meinheimer.

671
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,798
My God!

672
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,871
He can walk!

673
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,395
A miracle!

674
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,477
l can walk!

675
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,153
Get off me!

676
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,709
Hey! Come back here!

677
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,235
l... Yes, everything
seems to be OK now.

678
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,029
Without further ado,
l present you once again

679
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,752
the esteemed
Dr Albert S Meinheimer.

680
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,589
Hold everything!

681
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,117
Don't listen to this man.
He's a fraud. And l can prove it.

682
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,593
- What are you doing?
- The real doctor has a mole here!

683
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,035
God!

684
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,870
Obviously, a forgery!

685
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,632
We'll see about this!

686
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,473
Drebin!

687
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,110
Hold it! Frank is right!

688
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,476
There is a fraud here,
but it's This man.

689
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,917
And he's just given us
this signed confession implicating...

690
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,956
that man!

691
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,314
No. No.

692
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,472
That man. Hapsburg.

693
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,755
They're gone. Let's go!

694
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,993
Let me go!

695
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,399
The roof.

696
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,790
Come on, Frank. Hurry! Come on!

697
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,592
Let go!

698
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,468
l intend to share with you my report
on the need for a national policy,

699
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,439
based on energy efficiency
and clean renewable energy sources.

700
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,958
Over there!

701
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,599
Take cover!

702
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,312
Cover me. I’m going in.

703
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,239
All right.

704
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,595
Where's Hapsburg?

705
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,077
- Where you hit?
- it’s not that. You're on my groin.

706
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,434
Sorry.

707
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,193
- Where is he?
- You're too late.

708
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,636
Hapsburg has Plan B in...

709
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,869
in...

710
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,109
in...

711
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,955
Where?

712
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:12,079
Where? All right.
Who else is almost dead?

713
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,999
OK, now.

714
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,353
- Talk.
- You're too late.

715
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,069
- He already said that.
- Where'd he leave off?

716
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,709
- Er, ''Hapsburg has Plan B in...''
- Oh, yeah.

717
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,519
Hapsburg has Plan B in...

718
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,955
- in...
- Where?

719
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,032
Where? Talk, you low-life scum.

720
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,874
Gee, if that's your attitude,
forget it.

721
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,114
I’m right here, Drebin.

722
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,436
Drop your gun.

723
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,313
l believe you were
enquiring about Plan B.

724
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,312
That's when we detonate
a small nuclear device.

725
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,669
Dr Meinheimer can talk all he wants,
no one will be alive to hear him.

726
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,194
Detonation sequence activated.

727
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,795
I’m the only one
who knows the abort code.

728
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,997
in ten minutes,
this building and everyone in it

729
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,071
will be reduced to rubble.

730
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,119
I’ll be safely on my helicopter.

731
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,557
Tomorrow, I’ll be in Botswana.
What do you think of that?

732
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,950
You seem to be in touch
with your anger.

733
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,430
You can't talk
your way out of this one.

734
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,230
Go ahead. Threaten me like you have
the American people for so long.

735
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,871
You're part of a dying breed! Like
people who can name all 50 states.

736
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:51,398
The truth hurts. Maybe not as much
as jumping on a bike with no seat,

737
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,799
but it hurts.

738
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,592
That's as far as you go.
Any final requests, Lieutenant?

739
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,636
Can l have the gun?

740
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,076
Oh, no. I’m not gonna fall
for that one.

741
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,229
Not so fast!

742
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,554
Six minutes to detonation.

743
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,200
Now talk. Give me that abort code!

744
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,192
OK. I’ll talk. There are six numbers.

745
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,872
Two-one-seven...

746
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,357
Thanks a lot(!)

747
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,674
- You sure you're all right?
- I’m fine.

748
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,716
- And you?
- I’m fine.

749
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,236
But unless we disarm this
in five minutes, we blow.

750
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,518
- My God! We've gotta warn everyone!
- Yeah, right.

751
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,639
- You'd better go.
- No, I’m staying here with you.

752
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:09,709
But, Jane...

753
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,191
Frank, if you're blown to bits,
l wanna be here with you.

754
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,994
Jane, l promise you,

755
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:25,030
if we come out alive, I’ll never let
work interfere with our love again.

756
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,718
The bomb! OK, Nordberg, let's go!

757
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,155
Four minutes to detonation.

758
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,878
What are we gonna do?

759
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,155
Operator's manual.
See what you can find.

760
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,193
Here! To reset code,
press pound sign.

761
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,472
The speed of this sequence
has been greatly increased.

762
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,790
Detonation now in two minutes.

763
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:57,113
..so instead of spending
2.5 billion dollars

764
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,351
on research
into nuclear waste disposal,

765
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:08,551
the federal government,
for only 500 million dollars,

766
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,794
could increase solar panels by 90%%%.

767
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:18,510
As Albert Einstein once said...

768
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,989
Hey, wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

769
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:25,198
For God's sake, quick!
This place is gonna blow!

770
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,113
I’ll get the lights!

771
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,668
..an effective national energy plan.

772
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,716
Now to elaborate...

773
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,952
Here, read this. it’s an emergency!

774
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:47,116
''His strong manly hands
probed every crevice

775
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,237
''of her silken femininity,

776
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,959
''their undulating bodies writhing,

777
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,511
''in sensual rhythm, as he thrust
his purple-headed warrior

778
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,751
''into her quivering mound
of love pudding...''

779
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,470
OK. Listen up! l want you
to calmly file towards the exits.

780
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:10,714
That's it. That's it.
Nobody run, just walk, single-file.

781
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,837
lf we stay calm, no one will be hurt

782
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,629
by the huge bomb
that's gonna explode any minute.

783
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,032
it’s a cook book! it’s a cook book!

784
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,395
Twenty seconds to detonation.

785
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,558
What shall we do?

786
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,951
- it’s got my sleeve!
- No!

787
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,110
Ten... Nine...

788
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,599
Eight... Seven...

789
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,749
Six...

790
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,795
Five... Four...

791
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,913
Three... Two...

792
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,353
- Let's go!
- One...

793
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,593
Frank! Look!

794
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,191
You did it!

795
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,110
Thank you, Mr President,
for those kind words.

796
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,839
it’s all part of the job.

797
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,879
Frank, please consider
filling a post I’m creating.

798
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,555
it may mean long hours
and dangerous nights,

799
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,155
surrounded by some of the scummiest
elements in our society.

800
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,789
You want me to be in your cabinet?

801
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,438
No.

802
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:37,038
l want you to head up a new
federal bureau of Police Squad.

803
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,998
What a great honour!

804
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,072
it’s what you've always wanted!
Congratulations.

805
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,151
Nice going, Frank!

806
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,037
Thank you, Mr President.

807
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,151
I’m very honoured.

808
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,231
This is something l've dreamed of.

809
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:04,031
But I’m afraid I’m going to have to
turn down your offer, Mr President.

810
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,556
You see, l've learnt
something this week.

811
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,349
About the Earth. And about love.

812
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,037
l guess love's like the ozone layer.
You never miss it till it's gone.

813
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,956
Blowing away a fleeing suspect with
my .44 Magnum was everything to me.

814
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,679
l enjoyed it. Well, who wouldn't?

815
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,470
But now l want to be
the environmental policeman.

816
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,072
l want a world where Frank Jr,
and all Frank Jrs,

817
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,230
can sit under a shady tree,

818
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,392
breathe the air, swim in the ocean,

819
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,598
and go into a 7-Eleven
without an interpreter.

820
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,271
l want a world where l can eat
a sea otter without getting sick.

821
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,271
Where the Democrats put somebody
forward worth voting for.

822
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,349
l may not get there with ya!

823
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:19,072
But l want a world where l can wake
up with this woman, whom l love.

824
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,156
- Frank!
- Jane?

825
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,915
- Frank! Frank!
- Jane, will you marry me?

826
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,230
Yes, of course I’ll marry you!

827
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,951
We love Frank!

828
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,951
Frank, turn around!

829
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,152
Oh, George! Help!

830
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,918
Let's see if l've got this.

831
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,275
Energy efficiency - good.

832
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,036
Drilling in an Arctic national
wildlife refuge - bad.

833
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,910
Mr President? You OK?

834
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,991
Yeah, fine, thanks.

835
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
