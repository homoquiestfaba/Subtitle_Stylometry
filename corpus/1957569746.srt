1
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,241
Good evening.

2
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,209
I'm from Essex, in case you couldn't tell.

3
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,796
My given name is Dickie,

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,844
I come from Billericay, and I'm doing...

5
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:36,723
very well!

6
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:42,019
# Had a love affair with Nina
in the back of my Cortina

7
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:46,608
# A seasoned up hyena
could not have been more obscener

8
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:51,446
# She took me to the cleaners
and other misdemeanours

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,409
# But I got right up between her
Rum and her Ribena

10
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,664
# Well, you ask Joyce and Vicky

11
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,961
# if candy-floss is sticky

12
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,006
# I ain't a blinking thicky

13
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:10,299
# I'm Billericay Dickie

14
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,970
# And I'm doing very well

15
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,849
# I bought a lot of brandy

16
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:20,310
# When I was courting Sandy

17
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:22,604
# Took eight to make her randy

18
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,982
# And all I had was shandy

19
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,527
# Another thing with Sandy

20
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:29,904
# What often came in handy

21
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,240
# Was passing her a mandy

22
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,659
# She didn't half go bandy

23
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:39,164
# Well, you ask Joyce and Vicky

24
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:43,502
# if I ever took the mickey

25
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,547
# I ain't a common thicky

26
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,840
# I'm Billericay Dickie

27
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:53,095
# And I'm doing very well

28
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,390
# I rendezvous with Janet

29
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,726
# Quite near the Isle of Thanet

30
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,145
# She looked more like a gannet

31
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:03,565
# She wasn't half a prannet

32
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,358
# Her mother tried to ban it

33
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,195
# Her father helped me plan it "Go on, son"

34
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,572
# And when I captured Janet

35
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,450
# She bruised her pomegranate

36
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,454
# Oh, you ask Joyce and Vicky

37
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,917
# if I ever shaped up tricky

38
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:29,008
Tell him to shut that racket up!

39
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,011
# And I'm doing very well!

40
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:36,725
# You should never hold a candle

41
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,603
# if you don't know where it's been

42
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:45,317
# The jackpot is in the handle

43
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:49,905
# On a normal fruit machine

44
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:55,161
# So, you ask Joyce and Vicky

45
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,290
# Who's their favourite brickie

46
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,961
# I ain't a common thicky

47
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,381
# I'm Billericay Dickie

48
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:09,843
# And I'm doing very well

49
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:14,556
# So, you ask Joyce and Vicky

50
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,062
# About Billericay Dickie

51
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,651
# I ain't a fucking thicky
I'm Billericay Dickie

52
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:29,239
# And I'm doing very well #

53
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:39,958
One, two, one...

54
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:59,063
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, hold on, hold on.

55
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,587
- Your timing's off, mate.
- Well, you're out of tune.

56
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:04,090
This ain't jazz. Learn to play
drums and I'll learn to sing in tune.

57
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,569
Let's be nice, lads.

58
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,487
How can you tell if a stage is level?

59
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,893
'Cause the drummer dribbles
out of both sides of his mouth!

60
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,516
- Yeah, very bleedin' funny.
- Not as funny as this, mate.

61
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,162
- You're fucking fired!
- What?

62
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:15,996
Oh, not again! Oh, yes!

63
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,939
- Oh, I'll take the equipment, then.
- All right.

64
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,335
Your body odour smells
like a fucking orang-utan on heat.

65
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,984
You smell like
your mother's cock and balls.

66
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:23,589
Two fucking cymbals, mate.

67
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,131
Come on, then. Who wants him out?

68
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,792
I've just given birth. Any chance
you could keep the noise down?

69
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:38,479
Oh!

70
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,151
It's a boy.

71
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,987
You are so clever.

72
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,201
I'll be in the kitchen, all right?

73
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:01,169
Now look what you done.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,853
We're all on our own now, son.

75
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,982
Now listen, you monkeys.

76
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,529
Stories are what we tell ourselves

77
00:06:25,738 --> 00:06:29,074
to make ourselves feel better
about ourselves.

78
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:34,038
So, never let the truth
get in the way of a good story.

79
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:37,708
Once upon a time,

80
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,714
in a mystical land far, far away,

81
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,800
well, Southend-on-Sea,

82
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,177
a young prince holidayed.

83
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,638
His name was lan Dury.

84
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:54,601
He was handsome, healthy,
highly intelligent.

85
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,897
And brilliant at swimming.

86
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,691
Oh!

87
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:10,493
Look at me. Weren't I a lovely little chap?

88
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,550
But in the pool, evil lurked.

89
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:34,102
Its name was polio.
A water-borne contamination.

90
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:38,147
A virus, and when it gets
into your system, you've had it.

91
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,693
Pay attention, chaps!

92
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,489
The polio virus, a.k.a. the crippler.

93
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:48,325
It attacks the nervous system
here, here and here.

94
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,286
Makes you bloody nervous
'cause it can bloody well kill you!

95
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:56,000
It inflames the brainstem,
fucks with the spinal cord,

96
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:58,961
leading to paralysis and muscular wasting.

97
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:02,966
Lock up your children. No one is safe!

98
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,510
A monstrous epidemic.

99
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,776
Daddy!

100
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,242
Bloody hell. It's the Muppets!

101
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,670
We are the band.

102
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,839
You've got to be joking?

103
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,222
We was going to call ourselves
Cripple, Nigger, Yid,

104
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,682
Chink and Dead Fish,

105
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,935
but we didn't get any bookings.

106
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,189
Could you direct us
to the artistes' dressing rooms?

107
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,404
Oh, you are so gonna miss all of this.

108
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,867
When we've made our millions and
we're playing Hammersmith Odeon...

109
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,828
Why, don't they have three inches
of piss in the dressing rooms?

110
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:52,790
Nah, it's all shag pile carpets
and extraordinary acoustics.

111
00:09:55,586 --> 00:10:00,090
# For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow... #

112
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,635
Oi. Did you hear the one
about the dyslexic pimp

113
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,844
who set up a warehouse?

114
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,932
Go on, my son!

115
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,476
# And so say all of us #

116
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,353
Yay!

117
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,522
Is Dad coming?

118
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,025
Hey, what do you call a man
with paper trousers?

119
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:18,818
Russell.

120
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:21,218
Hope you don't mind me saying so, Russell,

121
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:23,990
but you are being
a rather miserable old cunt.

122
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,598
What do you think
we should spend our money on?

123
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:29,538
I don't know. Birthday presents?
Birthday hats? Birthday cards?

124
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,169
Hey, everyone! Let's give him the bumps!

125
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,171
Let's give him the bumps!

126
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,176
Well, I'd just like to say

127
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,886
that you've been a monumentally
atrocious audience tonight,

128
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:46,491
apart from the faithful few
at the front, it's the worst gig...

129
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:48,183
Yes, a big hand for you lot.

130
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,707
It's the worst gig we've ever played
since Sidcup Crematorium.

131
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,065
But we'd like to finish anyway
with a song called Blackmail Man.

132
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,110
- One! Two!
- One, two. One, two, three, four!

133
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,197
Three! Four!

134
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:08,746
# I'm an Irish cripple, a Scottish Jew
I'm the blackmail man

135
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:12,584
# A raspberry ripple, a buckle my shoe
I'm the blackmail man

136
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,419
# A silvery spoon, a bubble and squeak

137
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:16,004
# I'm the blackmail man

138
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,822
# Well, I'm the blackmail man and
I know what you do, every one of you

139
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,217
# I'm the blackmail man

140
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:22,094
# You make me sick, make me Tom and Dick

141
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:24,096
# Blackmail man, blackmail man

142
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:31,479
I wouldn't have booked 'em if I'd known.
What a load of shite.

143
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,689
Can't hold a tune.

144
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:43,742
Come on, Russell, get it right,
you doughnut.

145
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:46,661
- You're fucking shit! Get off!
- Fuck off!

146
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:52,126
Russ! Where are you going?
Russell, wait. Wait!

147
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,211
# Fraser and Nash pony and trap

148
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,213
# Up your 'arris, in your mince

149
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:59,509
# Hamptons don't leave fingerprints
I'm the blackmail man

150
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,350
Call that singing? You're shit.

151
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:08,894
Fuck off!

152
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,361
I'm more of an Emerson, Lake
and Palmer man myself.

153
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,958
I thought you were fucking great.

154
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,420
Really?

155
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:38,216
Great as in celebrated,

156
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,763
illustrious, famous?

157
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:49,770
Or great as in large, fat, bloated?

158
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:53,191
Something you do to a nutmeg, perhaps?

159
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,902
Great as in great!

160
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,612
And I should know.

161
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,115
I saw Jimi Hendrix before anyone.

162
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,117
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

163
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:08,082
Tell me. Was Jimi... nice?

164
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,460
Yeah. He was extremely polite.

165
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:14,213
So, do you always wear those glasses?

166
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,548
For your protection, my dear.

167
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:25,141
I am very, very good with women.

168
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:29,145
I used to live with me mum
and her two sisters.

169
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,774
I like women so much,

170
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,653
I used to think
I was a repressed homosexual.

171
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,449
But I'm not.

172
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:45,371
Fortuitously, I am gorgeous to look at.

173
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,503
Can I tickle your tonsils, please, miss?

174
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:55,465
- Maybe.
- Mmm.

175
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,718
You have to be extremely polite.

176
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,140
Oi, sling your hook.

177
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,808
Just pay up what was agreed.

178
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:07,227
I didn't agree to a bunch of spazzers
from the mental home.

179
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,647
You see, that's just not
a very spiritual thing to say!

180
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:11,815
Well, have a look at your drummer!

181
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,567
What's the problem?

182
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,134
He can't leave the stage at the interval.

183
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,570
So?

184
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,512
Well, it don't happen
to fuckin' Pink Floyd, does it?

185
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:21,117
And as for Long John Silver...
Oi, mate, you puttin' it on?

186
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:22,661
You didn't limp like that on stage.

187
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,203
Oh, no. On stage I try to hover.

188
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:27,165
Look, I'm sure we can come
to some friendly agreement.

189
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,584
Yeah, we can agree you can't sing,
you're past it

190
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,336
and you look like a Potato Jesus.

191
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,505
- No offence.
- None taken,

192
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,800
you fat-ankled fucker.

193
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,177
Fat ankles?

194
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,115
I might be a fucking cripple, mate,
but I'm dangerous, all right?

195
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:44,600
You wanna sort out your inner calm.

196
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,936
Nice one, Davey, go on.

197
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,107
Go on, my son, get in there!

198
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,870
Russell. Russ, we need to talk about this.

199
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:08,375
There you are. There's your millions.
Joke money, joke life.

200
00:15:09,377 --> 00:15:10,857
It's over, mate. We're going nowhere.

201
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:12,839
Russ, why you got to say things like that?

202
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,549
I quit.

203
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,551
Nobody quits.
Quitting is not in the vocabulary.

204
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:19,721
Yeah? What about "Fuck you, Ian"?
Is that in the vocabulary?

205
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:22,349
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

206
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,898
Go on, then. Go on.
I don't fucking need you.

207
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,443
What do you mean?
I write the music, I drive the van.

208
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:34,259
I carry you up the stairs
when you're pissed.

209
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,654
I make the fucking sandwiches.

210
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:37,991
Can you drive? Yeah, see, she can drive.

211
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:40,368
And I bet she can make fucking
sandwiches and all.

212
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:43,246
Russell, come on. Look, we're talking,
mate. We're trying to talk!

213
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,831
Russell!

214
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:48,167
Right, you're fucking fired.
You are, you're fired.

215
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,754
You didn't quit, you were fired!

216
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,067
- Yes? Do I know you?
- No.

217
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,361
Well, do us a favour
and fuck off, will you?

218
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,867
Hey, Ian, you know that geezer's
a keys player.

219
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:24,415
-That's not very polite, is it?
It's like being back at school.

220
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,542
- Are you a groupie?
- No, musician.

221
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:28,002
- What do you play?
- Oi.

222
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,277
Sorry about that. Where you
think you're going, you little monkey?

223
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:32,821
That was out of order back there.
It's the drink, you know, so...

224
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:36,969
It's like bad breath for the mind.
Someone said that you play keyboards.

225
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,222
Yeah. I play a little piano and guitar.

226
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:41,891
Oh, wow. Well, we don't have
any little ones, only the big sort.

227
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,102
- What's your name?
- Chaz.

228
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:45,520
- Chaz.
- Chaz Jankel.

229
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,439
Chaz Jankel? Very avant-garde.

230
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,233
Tell you what. Why don't you
come over tomorrow, hey?

231
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:52,277
After all, you know what they say.

232
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,906
"The more interesting a man,
the greyer his trousers."

233
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,827
But they also say, "You're never alone
with schizophrenia."

234
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:01,495
So what the fuck do they know?

235
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,709
But it's true,
we are all on our own, aren't we?

236
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:07,376
Oh, no, you're not!

237
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:10,589
- Oh, yes, I am!
- Oh, no, you're not!

238
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,341
The young prince was.

239
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,386
He was gonna die. Death was his bedfellow.

240
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:21,475
Some whispered,
"Oh, it might be better after all.

241
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,353
"I mean, what sort of quality of life?"

242
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:28,358
A cripple? A raspberry ripple?

243
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:37,033
But in the morning, he was still there!

244
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:41,162
You see, it's not the size
of the dog in the fight,

245
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:44,333
but the size of the fight in the dog!

246
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,668
Magnificent!

247
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,758
Trouble is, there's no cure for it.

248
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,677
Just like love.

249
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:57,764
There's no cure for that, neither.

250
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:22,456
Oi! Oi! Daddy's home!

251
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,337
Your dad's here.

252
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,596
And now, then, let's see
what the old clot has got.

253
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,641
For you, Jemima darling...

254
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,770
Boing!

255
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:49,068
And for you, my son... For your
birthday. Better late than never.

256
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:01,414
So powerful no man could stop him.

257
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,724
Rubbish.

258
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:32,823
Don't make me angry.
You won't like it when I'm angry!

259
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,076
Dr Banner, you're changing!

260
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:43,751
But with pain comes power! Hulk is strong!

261
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:54,929
...he doesn't need you turning
up out of the blue bringing gifts.

262
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:57,016
He needs a father!

263
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,934
He's got a father. I'm his father.

264
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:01,103
He needs a father who's around!

265
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,272
I'm around! I mean, well, I come around.

266
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:04,876
I was here when he was born, wasn't I?

267
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,402
Just downstairs, I mean,
not a lot of fathers can say that!

268
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:16,870
Found a couple that survived.
There's only two left.

269
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:20,957
He's been missing school. And stealing.

270
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,710
Well, that's all right. All boys do that.

271
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:28,590
It's a boy thing, isn't it?
A packet of fags, dirty magazine.

272
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:31,074
In fact, it's good. A sign of intelligence.

273
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:32,970
Shows a sensitivity about the world.

274
00:20:33,305 --> 00:20:35,556
- And he's being bullied.
- By who?

275
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:37,850
I told him not to retaliate.

276
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,042
You don't wanna do that. He wants to
give 'em a bloody good smacking.

277
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:42,503
Yeah, well, that's why he needs to
come and stay with you for a while.

278
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,482
No, no, no.

279
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,401
He needs you at the moment.

280
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,532
Look, I'm on the verge of something,
things are happening.

281
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,371
I've been offered some work at the Academy.

282
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,874
Good.

283
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,837
One of us needs to earn and I can't do
it stuck out here in the country.

284
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:10,134
I've always encouraged you, Ian.

285
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,013
Now it's your turn.

286
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,648
- Is Dad gone?
- Left about an hour ago.

287
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,297
Looks all right.

288
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:52,054
Blimey! How many more steps?
I'm not Sherpa bloody Tenzing.

289
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:55,141
It's Oval Mansions.
We get to live in a mansion together.

290
00:21:56,434 --> 00:21:58,144
Catshit Mansions more like.

291
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,424
All right.

292
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,470
What colour for the walls?
Would you say white?

293
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:34,433
Nah, that's too institutional.

294
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:37,101
- Blue, then?
- No, too constitutional.

295
00:22:38,396 --> 00:22:41,523
It should be... claret. Yeah.

296
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:44,484
Yeah, the colour of blood. Passion.

297
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:46,779
And a sort of booze.

298
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:49,574
- You up for it?
- Mmm-hmm.

299
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:52,952
I...

300
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,456
I can do anything. If you teach me.

301
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,686
What's wrong?

302
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,355
We're going to have to switch places

303
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,358
'cause I'm struggling to undo your
buttons here with my dodgy left hand.

304
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,369
Or you can do it, I don't mind.

305
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,007
# I come awake

306
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,970
# With a gift for womankind

307
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,391
# You're still asleep

308
00:23:54,602 --> 00:23:57,145
# But the gift don't seem to mind

309
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,400
# Rise on this occasion

310
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:03,193
Not too bad. Have you done this before?

311
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:05,237
# Halfway up your back

312
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,116
# Sliding down your body

313
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,162
# Touching your behind

314
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:17,583
# You look so self-possessed

315
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,044
Aw!

316
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:22,005
# I won't disturb your rest

317
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:26,301
# It's lovely when you're sleeping

318
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,846
# But wide awake is best

319
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:34,601
# Wake up and make love with me

320
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,439
# Wake up and make love

321
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:42,819
# Wake up and make love with me

322
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,779
# I don't want to make you

323
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:46,698
# I'll let the fancy take you

324
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:50,535
# And you'll wake up and make love

325
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,672
# You come awake

326
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:05,509
# In a horny morning mood

327
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:09,305
# And have a proper wriggle

328
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,352
# In the naughty naked nude

329
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,063
# Roll against my body

330
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,401
# Get me where you want me

331
00:25:22,945 --> 00:25:25,239
# What happens next is private

332
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,582
What are you doing?

333
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,003
This is Denise.

334
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:42,215
- Hello, Denise.
- That's Baxter.

335
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,885
Hello, Baxter.

336
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:48,472
Your door's unlocked.
Mum's putting the kettle on.

337
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,141
Nice.

338
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,436
Go on then, off you pop.

339
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:03,529
Thanks so much for this. So kind.

340
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:06,032
- Takes quite a lot to make a home.
- Yeah.

341
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:10,351
"Home is the place, no matter what
you've done, they have to let you in."

342
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,289
That's what Ian says.

343
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:15,583
- So you're a bass player?
- Bass player,

344
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:19,630
sandwich-maker, personal manager.
Sole driver of a van full of nutters.

345
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,217
We're looking forward
to having Baxter stay.

346
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,345
Any time you need help we're here.

347
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,306
Yeah, um...

348
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,685
He's a little fussy,
he doesn't like tomatoes,

349
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:36,230
- fruit of any kind, potatoes...
- Like father like son, eh?

350
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:43,530
- How old are you, Denise?
- I'm almost 20.

351
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:46,866
Oh!

352
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:52,945
- I'm sorry about that.
- It was always heavy for me, too.

353
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,725
Is that Elvis Presley?

354
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:16,398
Don't they teach you any
classical history at school these days?

355
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:19,485
That's Gene Vincent.

356
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,905
Scramble-egged his leg in a bike accident.

357
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,951
Him and Eddie Cochran

358
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:31,163
were the brightest stars in the firmament

359
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:36,586
when they climbed into a cab
outside the Savoy, April 16th, 1960.

360
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:42,300
Two hours later, they hit a hairpin bend.

361
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,430
Crash!

362
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:51,519
Eddie Cochran is lying
dying in his own blood.

363
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:58,693
And who hands Sweet Gene
his guitar that night outside the hotel?

364
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,447
A 14-year-old Marc Bolan,

365
00:28:02,532 --> 00:28:05,659
who marries Pink Floyd's
management secretary,

366
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:08,828
who signs me to Stiff Records.

367
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,251
Shake my hand.

368
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:24,845
You're only five steps away from greatness.

369
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,267
- Stiff?
- Stiff, yeah.

370
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:31,632
Their motto is "If it ain't Stiff,
it ain't worth a fuck!"

371
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:33,980
How's school?

372
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,317
Headmistress is a bit of
a stuck-up old cow.

373
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:40,487
Oi, language, bit of respect.
Education's important.

374
00:28:42,074 --> 00:28:45,284
Delacroix, French, Frenchman he was,
painter, he said,

375
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:47,579
"Inspiration is getting to our studies
at 9 a.m."

376
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,584
Go on, hit it.

377
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:14,816
You know what I'm talking about,

378
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,609
you barely said two words to the woman.

379
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:19,426
- You can't treat people like that.
- Don't give me that load of old bollock.

380
00:29:19,446 --> 00:29:21,155
Bet and I have got a special relationship.

381
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,616
Exactly, she's your wife.

382
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,951
Yeah, based on love and trust
and understanding.

383
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,954
What, and taking the piss?
You were really fucking rude, Ian.

384
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:31,291
It was the past, all right?
It's a separate existence.

385
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:35,546
Anyway, I asked you to marry me,
you keep saying no.

386
00:29:35,631 --> 00:29:37,923
This isn't a joke. You've got children.

387
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,343
You are never gonna be separate.
Do you understand that?

388
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:44,097
Excuse me, I'm trying to sleep.

389
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:18,675
# My old man was fairly handsome

390
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,848
# Later on he drove a Roller

391
00:30:25,642 --> 00:30:27,976
# Chauffeuring for foreign men

392
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:37,946
Daddy!

393
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:42,283
# Perhaps he had to keep his distance

394
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,374
# My old man was fairly handsome

395
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,880
You all right, boy?

396
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:00,928
Come on.

397
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,982
Boxers always touch themselves
on the side of the face to remind them

398
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:05,475
to keep their guard up.

399
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,104
That's it. Move your feet, come on.
Move your feet, move about.

400
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,732
That's it. Keep moving about.

401
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,943
You're too square on. Move around the side.

402
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,862
Good, orthodox, lovely.

403
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,706
All them southpaws
should be buried at birth.

404
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:21,032
Where are you going?
That's it, stand up. All right.

405
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:23,577
Now move about, on the balls
of your feet if you can.

406
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:26,580
That's it. Plenty of that.
Plenty of leg movement.

407
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,376
When you're ready,
I want you to take a swing at me.

408
00:31:30,503 --> 00:31:32,420
All right? Give me your best shot. Come on.

409
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:38,176
All the best, mate, from your son.

410
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:42,806
Turtle! Turtle! Turtle! Turtle!

411
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,434
What's all this?

412
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:54,693
You have to get up on your own.

413
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,196
That's the rule here, isn't it, children?

414
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,823
Yes, Mr Hargreaves.

415
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:03,119
I'm not staying here.
My daddy's coming to take me away.

416
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:05,830
Oh, your daddy, eh? Good for you.

417
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,089
Shape up. You got to be brave, all right?

418
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:18,218
No one's taking liberties with you, boy.
Give me your best shot, come on.

419
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:24,309
All right?

420
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:28,688
No, you gotta stand on your own.

421
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:34,820
All right.

422
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,948
All right. Well done, son. You did good.

423
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:41,285
But no one out there is gonna help you.

424
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:42,953
Now that's seems harsh, I know,

425
00:32:43,037 --> 00:32:46,248
but you're born on your own,
you die on your own.

426
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:48,751
And in between, you earn your own respect.

427
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,213
Never give up, never.

428
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:54,966
And never step into a dead man's
shoes. You know what that means?

429
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:00,430
It means you gotta do it for yourself.

430
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,517
Being the underdog with nothing to lose
is the best place to start.

431
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,356
I'm doing pretty good at the moment,
you know. Yeah?

432
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:13,277
I got one or two proper deals
on the go. Money owed.

433
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:16,697
I got a nice penthouse in Old Victoria,
I'm happy with me digs.

434
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:23,329
You should come and see me.
Would you like that?

435
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:27,501
Would you? Yeah, I'd like that.

436
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,472
# My old man #

437
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,375
Dad? Dad?

438
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,173
- What time is it?
- Lunchtime.

439
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,894
- Is that your mum?
- It's the school on the phone.

440
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,687
It's the headmistress.

441
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,568
Hello? Hello?

442
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,194
Hello?

443
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,118
This is Baxter's headmistress.
Is that Mr Dury?

444
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,989
Yes. Mr Dury speaking. Yes.

445
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,597
Are you aware that Baxter had school today?

446
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,035
- Mmm-hmm.
- Do you understand?

447
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,996
Yeah. No, no, I do understand, yes.
Yeah, of course.

448
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,457
I'm sure I don't need to tell you
how important it is...

449
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,252
Yeah, no, I do understand, yes.
Yes. Okey dokey, yes.

450
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,777
Well, it's all very well
saying you understand,

451
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,321
but this is your son's future
we're talking about.

452
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,716
Mmm-hmm.

453
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,574
- Your wife told me about...
- Mmm-hmm. Well...

454
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,076
And I want you to know that I'm not...

455
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,931
You know what? He was right.
You are a bit of a stuck-up old cow.

456
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:02,142
- I beg your pardon? How dare you?
- Tiddley poo, madam.

457
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,774
Snotty old maggot, she is.
Put on the kettle, will you?

458
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,621
Ta.

459
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:26,960
- Where's Denise?
- She's gone out.

460
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:32,591
You're gonna have to help me
put me leg on, then.

461
00:35:36,138 --> 00:35:37,847
Right, if you could... Come here.

462
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:42,352
Let me swing round, I'll put my arm
round you. After three. One,

463
00:35:42,853 --> 00:35:44,396
two, three.

464
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,857
That's it.

465
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,485
See me new leg? Look at that.

466
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:52,613
Phwoar.

467
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:54,740
Been waiting for that for ages. Beautiful.

468
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:56,284
You do that one, I'll do this one.

469
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:59,370
Get this underneath.

470
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,214
I'm still getting used to it
myself, actually.

471
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,168
See what your old man has to go
through every day? What a palaver.

472
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:12,967
Dear Jemima, I've been working
with a man called Chaz.

473
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:16,846
If we do well, we will have
disgusting ice cream.

474
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:19,141
If we don't, we will cry.

475
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,603
Boo-hoo! I can't wait for you
to meet Denise.

476
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,026
You should come up and visit sometime.

477
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,904
Baxter's turning into
a right little geezer.

478
00:36:31,988 --> 00:36:34,740
Always keep a strong heart
in case of sadness.

479
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,743
Love, your charming father,

480
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:40,121
Dad, Nebbish, Clot.

481
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,998
I'm going to disagree with Nigel.

482
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,875
The real shock here
is the whole Sex Pistols

483
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,837
swearing on television,
Bill Grundy being sacked,

484
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,423
it all turning into some sort
of moral panic.

485
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,258
I mean, these boys are the future.

486
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,469
They're the voice of a young generation.

487
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:55,763
Fucking Sex Pistols. Bollocks.

488
00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,766
And he nicked my razorblade-earring
idea and all, didn't he?

489
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,518
Turn it off, Den, will you?

490
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:02,604
I'm sorry, Nigel, I'm sorry.

491
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:09,444
If you get bitter,
you have a strong heart. Remember?

492
00:37:10,446 --> 00:37:12,906
Never let it be said
that my failure went to me head.

493
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,661
"Swearing on the television

494
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:22,000
"is not funny and not fucking clever!"

495
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:23,584
Language.

496
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:25,788
First words my sister ever said
were, "Fuck off, Dad."

497
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:27,338
Must be inherited.

498
00:37:27,464 --> 00:37:28,965
Does she sack drummers, too?

499
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,573
Incredible Hulk doesn't swear, does he?

500
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:32,677
- He's got a moral compass.
- That's right.

501
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:35,578
Moral compass? I'm an entertainer,
not Christopher bleeding Columbus.

502
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,266
Oi, what do you think of that?

503
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,601
Nah, that's too, uh, too romantic.
Here you go.

504
00:37:39,685 --> 00:37:41,103
Is that all?

505
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:42,980
It's been a slow week. - Ian?

506
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,357
Uh, too satanic.

507
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:47,985
Oi, oi, what's wrong with that one?

508
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:50,530
- You're always giving me that one.
- Yeah, and?

509
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:52,448
We know all about that, Ian.

510
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:55,243
Oh, no, no, Chaz, Chaz, Chaz. That,

511
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,371
that is a riddle. It's a love song.
It's a questioning.

512
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,415
It's a striving of the human soul.

513
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,209
It's just...
It's called Sex, Drugs & Rock & Roll.

514
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,045
That's good.

515
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,963
-Mmm-mmm, it's too obvious.
Tell him, Denny.

516
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,632
Look, it's a celebration. It's...

517
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:11,593
It's an anthem for all the outsiders,
for all the uglies,

518
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:13,054
for all the freaks, you know,

519
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:17,141
who are slaving away every day
in their shit shirts

520
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:20,562
and their shit shoes, trying to fit in.

521
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:22,730
"Is that all there is to life?" they ask.

522
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:25,983
And then, lo and behold...

523
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,867
- Can you dance to that, Denny?
- Yeah, if you dance with me.

524
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:35,578
You nicked that.

525
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:37,582
God, everyone's a critic these days,
aren't they?

526
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:42,293
The immature artist plagiarises
and the mature artist steals.

527
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:44,378
And I am about to grow up.

528
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:53,137
Sex, drugs and rock and roll.

529
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,308
Okay, how about...

530
00:38:58,018 --> 00:39:00,354
See? Blue's your colour, you know that?

531
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,564
That's it. That's it.

532
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,027
# Grey is such a pity

533
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:10,323
Yeah! Look at you all! Look, look.

534
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,576
You're magnificent! You are gonna be

535
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,578
- just like your dad.
- No, no.

536
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:17,122
- A proper little geezer.
- No.

537
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:18,623
- Baxter, come on.
- Don't.

538
00:39:18,707 --> 00:39:20,083
Baxter, stop fidgeting.

539
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,627
Bax... Stop it.

540
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:23,128
- Don't be such a baby.
- Get off.

541
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,467
Who did that?

542
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:32,054
Boys. Bigger boys.

543
00:39:34,182 --> 00:39:36,183
They said I was posh.

544
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,811
Are we posh?

545
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,357
No, we're arts and crafts.

546
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:45,568
That's what we are. We're arts and crafts.

547
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:53,786
There. That's handsome, isn't it?

548
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:18,520
Baxter!

549
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:20,772
There he is, here's my son.

550
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:23,048
These are all my friends.
Say hi to Baxter, everybody.

551
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:25,069
Big round of applause for my son.

552
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:27,655
Baxter Front, I like to call him.

553
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:33,600
Listen, we haven't tried this one before.

554
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,686
It's a little experimentation.
Oi, Chaz, let's start this up.

555
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:38,314
We'll go for the rock. We'll have
white face, black shirt, white socks.

556
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:39,792
One, two, three, four.

557
00:40:40,502 --> 00:40:42,462
# Who, who, who slapped John?

558
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,008
# White face, black shirt

559
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:48,469
# White socks, black shoes

560
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:50,971
# Black hair, white Strat,
bled white, died black

561
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:53,765
# Sweet Gene Vincent

562
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:56,560
# There's one in every town

563
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,021
# And the devil drives

564
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:00,522
# Till the hearse arrives

565
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:02,484
# And you lay that pistol down

566
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:03,928
Just keep singing that last verse.

567
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:05,778
# Sweet Gene Vincent

568
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,698
# There's one in every town

569
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,368
# And the devil drives till the hearse...

570
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,370
Keep singing!

571
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,750
# Sweet Gene Vincent

572
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:28,386
I hope you don't mind me saying,

573
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,160
but you are being a bit
of a right old moody.

574
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,681
We said we'd look after him, Ian.

575
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,558
Yeah, I know. He's my son.

576
00:41:33,643 --> 00:41:36,083
- I've got him a driver and everything.
- What, someone reliable?

577
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:37,979
Yeah, yeah, of course.

578
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,356
- Really?
- I mean, the man was

579
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,160
a roadie with Led zeppelin,
for fuck's sake.

580
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:43,152
All right, Baxter?

581
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,362
I've got a little surprise for you.

582
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:49,116
Ooh, speak of the devil,
and he will appear.

583
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:52,244
Can you feel him slouching ever nearer?

584
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:56,707
Ooh, has Santa Claus come
early this year? No...

585
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:59,627
It's the Sulphate Strangler!

586
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:15,811
# The sons of the prophet
were brave men and bold

587
00:42:15,979 --> 00:42:18,105
# And quite unaccustomed to fear

588
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:21,483
# But the bravest by far
in the ranks of the Shah

589
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:24,696
# Was Abdulla Bulbul Ameer

590
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,490
# One day, this bold Russian

591
00:42:27,908 --> 00:42:29,534
# He shouldered his gun

592
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,829
# And donned his most truculent sneer

593
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:36,166
# Downtown he did go,
where he trod on the toe

594
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:39,587
# Of Abdulla Bulbul Ameer

595
00:42:43,216 --> 00:42:45,926
- Watch it!
- Oh, shit! Oh, sorry.

596
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:50,098
Lovely.

597
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,708
You all right, Dad?

598
00:44:15,606 --> 00:44:17,566
I'm doing pretty good
at the moment, you know.

599
00:44:19,026 --> 00:44:20,694
You should come and see me.

600
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:23,155
Would you like that?

601
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,278
# The sons of the
prophet were brave men and bold

602
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,281
# And quite unaccustomed to fear

603
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:50,915
Your mum told your dad to tell me
to make sure you went in. Now, go on.

604
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,875
I look like a prick.

605
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:14,272
Well, that went well, then.

606
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:17,651
Come on.

607
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,743
Did you? - Don't shout at me!

608
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:27,286
I'm not shouting. Who's shouting?

609
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,832
Did you or did you not
try and sell my typewriter?

610
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,792
- How would you know?
- 'Cause it says in here,

611
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:35,878
"For sale, Ian Dury's fucking typewriter"!

612
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,172
All right, I did it.

613
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:38,756
I admit it, all right? - Hello?

614
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:41,468
Ian, we need to work.

615
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:44,054
But you know what, Ian?
No one fucking wanted it.

616
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:48,309
I am not your fucking pet, all right?

617
00:46:48,643 --> 00:46:50,102
I'm as hungry for this as you are.

618
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:53,397
Oh, boo. The green-eyed
monster's coming out, is it?

619
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:55,817
The world doesn't revolve around you!

620
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:59,028
Oh, I think you'll find it fucking does.

621
00:46:59,113 --> 00:47:02,491
- How was school?
- Okay.

622
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:05,369
- Fuck you!
- Feeling left out, are you?

623
00:47:06,036 --> 00:47:09,123
- Double fuck you.
- Oh, fucking hell, that hurt.

624
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:12,667
Write some lines! I will show more respect!

625
00:47:12,753 --> 00:47:15,295
And I'm doing all this fucking work,
all this work

626
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:16,922
for the family, right?

627
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:19,592
You and me. You and me, it's for us.

628
00:47:22,513 --> 00:47:23,763
Oh, God.

629
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:25,348
You fight like a bloke, Denny.

630
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,523
Oh, great. Broke me new leg.

631
00:47:34,442 --> 00:47:36,067
Can you help me take it off, please?

632
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,820
Ian? Hello?

633
00:47:41,074 --> 00:47:42,931
Everything you do is
for the family, is it, Ian?

634
00:47:42,951 --> 00:47:45,828
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right, that's fucking bollocks.

635
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,873
Everything you do is for you,
on your terms.

636
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,250
And if the rest of us happen to fit along,

637
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:54,796
- then that is a fucking bonus.
- Is that what you think, is it?

638
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,520
- Yeah, that's what I think.
- Yeah? Is that what you really think?

639
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,343
'Cause if that's right,

640
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:02,805
well, you better fuck off, then,
because do you know what?

641
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:04,162
I can't handle this. I can't handle this.

642
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:07,435
I'm on a flow at the moment, right?
I'm right in it. I'm right inside it.

643
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:09,042
And you're getting right inside my brain,

644
00:48:09,062 --> 00:48:11,021
when I'm on one,
and I won't have it, all right?

645
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:12,856
So if you can't handle it, then fuck off.

646
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:17,454
You think you can do without me,
do you, Ian?

647
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:19,906
- Yeah.
- Really?

648
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:26,496
Oi. Can I have me leg back?

649
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:30,500
Oi, don't leave me on the floor.
I'm a raspberry.

650
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:37,132
Nice throw.

651
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:42,472
Just easy.

652
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:44,557
Got it!

653
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,019
Fuck! Fuck!

654
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:51,647
We can rebuild him.

655
00:48:57,989 --> 00:48:59,573
He just needs a bit of distance.

656
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,951
I'm either too close
or not far enough away.

657
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:06,663
Denise, what...

658
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,501
What happened to him
happened a long time ago.

659
00:49:10,836 --> 00:49:12,712
There's nothing we can do about it now.

660
00:49:15,215 --> 00:49:17,342
Everyone has their weakness.

661
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:22,180
It's just that his weakness is so obvious

662
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:23,932
he doesn't need to worry about it.

663
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,852
But what about me?

664
00:49:28,146 --> 00:49:30,272
What am I supposed to do?

665
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:32,983
My weakness is loving him.

666
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,038
Dad's home.

667
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:51,253
I'm knocking 40.

668
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,924
I'm a bit of a shorty.

669
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:58,761
Little bit haughty,
a bit nutty, a bit naughty...

670
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:00,930
Enough with the rhyming couplets.

671
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:03,098
Look, I will pay front money for the room,

672
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:06,561
proper wedge.
You can be the stern landlady,

673
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:08,835
with the surgical stockings
and the twinkle in her eye...

674
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,690
- This is serious.
- I will be

675
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,068
generally a domestic god for the duration.

676
00:50:13,152 --> 00:50:15,111
I promise. Please.

677
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,238
Oh, come on, Bet, just this once.

678
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:19,032
I've got work.

679
00:50:24,831 --> 00:50:25,872
All right?

680
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:33,005
Faster. Cured.

681
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:35,925
Healthy.

682
00:50:38,554 --> 00:50:40,388
Up, up, up!

683
00:50:41,015 --> 00:50:44,101
Sliders out first, then walkers.
All hands on!

684
00:50:44,853 --> 00:50:47,771
Come on! Come on, let's be having you.

685
00:50:48,565 --> 00:50:49,982
Oi, get a move on.

686
00:50:53,278 --> 00:50:54,903
Up, up, up!

687
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,366
Oi, Dury, get on with it.

688
00:51:12,006 --> 00:51:13,423
Shitter!

689
00:51:13,591 --> 00:51:16,385
Shitter, shitter, shitter!

690
00:51:17,387 --> 00:51:19,221
- Faster. Cured.
- Shitter, shitter.

691
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:21,473
Shitter, shitter.

692
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:24,143
- Faster.
- Shitter, shitter.

693
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:25,811
Cured. - Shitter, shitter.

694
00:51:26,104 --> 00:51:28,022
- Shitter, shitter.
- All right, all right!

695
00:51:28,149 --> 00:51:29,690
Get a move on!

696
00:51:34,822 --> 00:51:36,364
Where's your daddy now?

697
00:51:43,956 --> 00:51:47,543
Healthier. Improving.

698
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,837
Greenness, cured.

699
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,465
Frustration, stagger.

700
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,301
Stun!

701
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:59,181
Knock one down

702
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:02,725
with a feather, clever...

703
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:04,561
Clever Trevor.

704
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:07,064
See, the English language

705
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:11,318
is a gloriously sophisticated
smorgasbord of words and phrases.

706
00:52:11,778 --> 00:52:13,779
Songwriting's really not that complicated.

707
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,700
It's all about the verbals. I'll go first.

708
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:20,203
Cock.

709
00:52:20,495 --> 00:52:21,955
Your turn.

710
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:23,707
- Willy.
- Dick.

711
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:26,084
- Knob.
- Love truncheon.

712
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:27,836
- Dong.
- Meat and two veg.

713
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,129
Um...

714
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:33,091
Come on, keep them coming.

715
00:52:33,468 --> 00:52:35,260
- Rhythm stick.
- Chopper.

716
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,304
- Old man.
- Pork sword.

717
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:39,639
One-eyed trouser snake.

718
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:41,141
Ah!

719
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,936
Look at you all, look. Bloody marvellous.

720
00:52:44,062 --> 00:52:47,064
I love being
in the warm bosoms of my family.

721
00:52:47,774 --> 00:52:49,234
You know why?

722
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:52,653
Because I love warm bosoms.

723
00:52:53,114 --> 00:52:54,572
Dad...

724
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,700
Come on, dinner's on the table.

725
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:10,153
Come on, then. Touch me again
and I'll punch your head in.

726
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:13,073
Kick your head in. Kick your head in!

727
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,992
Touch me again
and I'll kick your fucking teeth

728
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:18,036
so far down your Gregory Peck,

729
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,920
you'll be able to eat
out of your Khyber Pass!

730
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,873
- Fuck me, look who it is.
- Fuck off!

731
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,125
Dreary Dury, the Dancing Durex.

732
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,587
- Don't get snotty on me, posh boy.
- Leave me alone.

733
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:28,422
Yeah, walk away! Fuck off!

734
00:54:28,506 --> 00:54:30,447
Gonna get your Spazzy Joe dad
to come and save you?

735
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,407
'Cause guess what?
We don't give a shit who he is.

736
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:33,987
- Fucking spaz.
- What's his name again?

737
00:54:34,054 --> 00:54:36,263
- Captain Cripple the Raspberry Ripple!
- Fuck off.

738
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:37,765
Who the fuck do you think you are?

739
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,310
You learnt some words, have you?
Proper little villain.

740
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:49,361
- All right, Bax?
- All right, Strang?

741
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:51,989
You know you've got blood
coming out of your nose?

742
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:03,459
"Who awoke the sleeping tiger?

743
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:06,337
"It was thee.

744
00:55:07,965 --> 00:55:12,010
"The dormant devil did no harm,

745
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:15,639
"except to me.

746
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:22,730
"The writer sat, scratching his arse,

747
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:27,109
"wishing he wasn't middle class..."

748
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,880
I've met someone else.

749
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,008
What, around here? You wanna be careful.

750
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:55,639
He's Welsh. He does ceramics.

751
00:55:55,724 --> 00:55:57,224
Oh, pottery sheep?

752
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:01,585
We should think about getting a divorce.

753
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:04,274
No. No.

754
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:09,321
It would be better for you,
better for the kids, better for Denise.

755
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:10,989
That's far too logical.

756
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:17,204
No, Bet, that would be
just like tossing everything away.

757
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:20,499
- Don't do this, Ian.
- I love you.

758
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:22,335
I know you love me.

759
00:56:25,339 --> 00:56:27,048
But you don't need me.

760
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:34,097
There's someone else who needs me.

761
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,295
Hello. Welcome home.

762
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:08,425
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you, too.

763
00:57:26,195 --> 00:57:29,031
You have painted.

764
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:31,199
Mmm-hmm. Freshen it up.

765
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:34,828
I thought it was looking a bit jaded.

766
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:44,422
- You don't like it, do you?
- I didn't say that.

767
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:47,341
But you don't.

768
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,018
It's all very...

769
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:00,605
white.

770
00:58:20,044 --> 00:58:21,461
Knock-knock.

771
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:27,676
Who's there?

772
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:34,683
We got some great tunes.

773
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:38,104
Now all we need is a band
with a drummer I can't sack. Hit me!

774
00:58:38,188 --> 00:58:39,605
- One, two!
- Three, four!

775
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:47,364
# You must have seen parties of Blockheads

776
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,408
# With blotched and lagered skin

777
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,495
# Blockheads with food particles
in their teeth

778
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,164
# What a horrible state they're in

779
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,002
# They've got womanly breasts
under pale mauve vests

780
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,630
# Shoes like dead pigs' noses

781
00:59:03,632 --> 00:59:06,384
# Cornflake packet jacket
Catalogue trousers

782
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,677
# A mouth what never closes

783
00:59:09,388 --> 00:59:12,348
# You must have seen Blockheads
in raucous teams

784
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:14,809
# Dressed up after work

785
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:18,313
# Who screw their poor old Eileens

786
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:21,024
# Get sloshed and go berserk

787
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,194
# Rotary accessory watches

788
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:27,031
# Hire-purchase signet rings

789
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:30,660
# A beauty to the bully boys

790
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:33,496
# No lonely vestige clings

791
00:59:33,872 --> 00:59:41,872
# Blockheads, Blockheads -Oi, oi!

792
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:51,132
# Blockheads, Blockheads

793
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:16,834
# Blockhead, Blockhead, Blockhead,
Blockhead, Blockhead! #

794
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:20,838
lan! Ian! lan!

795
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:26,931
Oh, this is it. Just on the right.
Pull in here.

796
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:40,984
Oh, my life!
God, it hasn't changed one little iota.

797
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,980
Right, then, Chris. Let's get this done

798
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:02,382
- before we attract too much attention.
- Okay, Ian.

799
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,516
- Nice.
- Oi! What are you doing?

800
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,018
- I'm bored.
- Only boring people get bored.

801
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:14,895
Go on, off you go.

802
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,484
Baxter, I'm not gonna tell you again.

803
01:01:21,737 --> 01:01:23,320
Couple of more poses.

804
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:28,117
Come on, Baxter, I'm working.

805
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:32,622
Hold it. Hold it there.

806
01:01:34,292 --> 01:01:35,708
Got it.

807
01:01:37,295 --> 01:01:38,879
Go on, off you go, son.

808
01:01:42,258 --> 01:01:43,801
Ladies and gentlemen,

809
01:01:43,885 --> 01:01:46,387
please welcome the jewel
in the English crown,

810
01:01:46,471 --> 01:01:48,681
Mr lan Dury!

811
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:56,272
One, two, three, four!

812
01:01:56,356 --> 01:01:58,483
# Sex & drugs & rock & roll

813
01:02:00,778 --> 01:02:02,571
# Are all my brain and body need

814
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,534
# Sex & drugs & rock & roll

815
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:13,749
# ls very good indeed

816
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:17,878
# Every bit of clothing
ought to make you pretty

817
01:02:18,046 --> 01:02:22,175
# You can cut the clothing
Grey is such a pity

818
01:02:22,343 --> 01:02:26,512
# I should wear the clothing
of Mr Walter Mitty

819
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:31,435
# See my tailor, he's called Simon
I know it's going to fit

820
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,608
# Here's a little bit of advice

821
01:02:37,692 --> 01:02:39,526
# You're quite welcome, it is free

822
01:02:39,777 --> 01:02:42,029
# Don't do nothing that is cut price

823
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:44,240
# You know what it'll make you be

824
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,408
# They will try their tricky device

825
01:02:46,577 --> 01:02:48,369
# Trap you with the ordinary

826
01:02:48,662 --> 01:02:50,830
# Get your teeth into a small slice

827
01:02:51,164 --> 01:02:53,666
# The cake of liberty!

828
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:18,560
# Sex & drugs & rock & roll

829
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:23,072
# Sex & drugs & rock & roll

830
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:36,163
# Sex, drugs, rock & roll!

831
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:46,681
# Sex, drugs, rock & roll #

832
01:04:13,919 --> 01:04:16,588
Ian! Ian! Ian!

833
01:04:22,762 --> 01:04:24,513
Ian! Ian!

834
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:33,147
See, people imagine
people like me want all of that,

835
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:37,526
to be popular and famous, but I don't.

836
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:42,907
I prefer being a lurker,
'cause I like being naughty.

837
01:04:43,743 --> 01:04:45,463
Paul McCartney says
when he gets recognised,

838
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:47,078
he just walks brusquely away.

839
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:50,707
Well, if I walk brusquely away,
I fall over and down I go a-tumble.

840
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,878
Did I say you could laugh?

841
01:04:53,962 --> 01:04:57,548
- Touch me, Ian! Touch me!
- I ain't the fucking Pope, am I?

842
01:04:58,509 --> 01:04:59,925
Now you can laugh.

843
01:05:01,803 --> 01:05:03,763
Ian! Ian!

844
01:05:14,942 --> 01:05:18,654
So, how's the new gaff?
Is it keeping all you guys productive?

845
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:23,075
Well, you've got to pace
your life, lie fallow for stages,

846
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,743
so that's what I'm doing.

847
01:05:24,828 --> 01:05:27,579
Biding me time till I'm ready to pounce.

848
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:32,710
Bax? Bax? Don't you want to swim?

849
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:35,297
- You sure?
- Yeah.

850
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,802
You yourself, have you lost that
common touch people said you had?

851
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:43,889
Oh, well, that all depends on
where I'm touching them, doesn't it?

852
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:47,560
Well, is it possible to
maintain a uniqueness, do you think?

853
01:05:47,686 --> 01:05:49,895
Well, we're all unique, aren't we? Eh?

854
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:54,400
Yeah, but if you wish to package
that uniqueness,

855
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:56,861
well, then you take risks.

856
01:05:57,529 --> 01:05:59,447
Don't we, Denise? Eh?

857
01:05:59,573 --> 01:06:01,449
Even with things in love?

858
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:04,077
Love. Mmm.

859
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,955
Well, there are people in this world
who act purely out of love.

860
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:10,834
Whereas, me, I'm a wanker being
interviewed by a cunt and I love it.

861
01:06:12,837 --> 01:06:14,797
Am I making a bit of a kipper
of meself, Denny?

862
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:18,300
I think this little squirt wants to know
how we're getting on.

863
01:06:19,803 --> 01:06:20,970
Well, I'd like to be at home.

864
01:06:21,054 --> 01:06:22,847
Oh, would you? Well, this is home.

865
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:25,808
No, this is rented
for a small fortune, actually.

866
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:29,229
Oh, well, you know, we've gotta be here
'cause we've got to work, haven't we?

867
01:06:29,313 --> 01:06:32,649
It's industrial relations now.
No time for real relations.

868
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,400
Yeah, I'd noticed.

869
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:47,206
All right, goose?

870
01:06:51,086 --> 01:06:53,796
Amphetamines. Speed, Billy Whizz,

871
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:56,299
Black Beauties, sulphate. Righteous stuff.

872
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:00,178
Originally a nasal decongestant.

873
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:02,555
Used during the war. It keeps you awake.

874
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,225
Basically, speed won the Battle of Britain.

875
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:09,688
They were flying very high,
those boys. Literally.

876
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:15,361
- That's a lot.
- Don't want to withdraw. Here you go.

877
01:07:20,785 --> 01:07:23,411
Go on, son. Give it here.

878
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,960
Your lives are to be spared.

879
01:07:31,296 --> 01:07:34,840
The terrible penalty of crucifixion
has been set aside...

880
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,885
What's this? - ...on the single condition

881
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:42,056
that you identify the body
or the living person

882
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,600
of the slave called Spartacus.

883
01:07:46,603 --> 01:07:48,896
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

884
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,773
Ow!

885
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,943
- You spilled me nuts.
- Oh, sorry.

886
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,695
Don't look for it now.

887
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,697
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

888
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,239
We should work.

889
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,326
Kirk Douglas is
just about to get crucified.

890
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,662
Yeah, I know, but I've just written
a brilliant riff, right?

891
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:06,666
- I promise you, it's a brilliant...
- Just relax, will you? You doughnut.

892
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,251
Ian, listen, it's fantastic.
We should go and work on it.

893
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:11,151
What are you?
Some kind of mad nutty professor?

894
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:12,971
Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch a movie.

895
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,932
- Chaz, you're standing in my way.
- I've got to get the guitar.

896
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,641
Will you get me some more nuts?

897
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:25,806
Actually, can you get me some olives
as well? Stoned.

898
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:34,695
Take a month.

899
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,953
Come on, Baxter, what's wrong with you?

900
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:44,455
-Scared of a bit of water?
Leave him alone, Ian.

901
01:08:44,665 --> 01:08:47,542
- Just jump in, it's the only way.
- No, I don't wanna.

902
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:49,878
- Look, he doesn't want to, Ian.
- Go on, I dare you.

903
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:51,463
- It's bloody freezing.
- Go on.

904
01:08:51,547 --> 01:08:53,923
- Let him off. Go on, Bax.
- No, no.

905
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:57,845
70% of the world is covered in water.
It's a very dangerous place.

906
01:08:57,929 --> 01:09:00,180
- Go on, Bax. Go on.
- Where are you going?

907
01:09:01,057 --> 01:09:03,100
Oi! Why don't you jump in?

908
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,936
Actually, I was a brilliant swimmer.

909
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,607
Don't you think how lucky we are?

910
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:12,235
Very big house and a pool

911
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,487
and a record at number one
in the hit parade.

912
01:09:15,156 --> 01:09:17,616
- Don't that make you happy?
- You need sleep, Ian.

913
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:20,786
Yeah, plenty of time for sleeping
when you're dead.

914
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,962
The last chicken in the shop,

915
01:09:31,048 --> 01:09:34,466
the juicy golden goosey

916
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:37,845
and I am cooked.

917
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:09,546
# In the deserts of Sudan

918
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,509
# And the gardens of Japan

919
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:18,931
# From Milan to Yucatán

920
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:24,144
# Every womans' every man

921
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:27,147
# Hit me with your rhythm stick

922
01:10:27,232 --> 01:10:29,066
# Hit me Hit me

923
01:10:29,568 --> 01:10:31,444
# lst gut, c'est fantastique

924
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:33,404
# Hit me, hit me, hit me!

925
01:10:34,031 --> 01:10:35,907
# Hit me with your rhythm stick

926
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:38,243
# It's nice to be a lunatic

927
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:40,621
# Hit me! Hit me!

928
01:10:47,837 --> 01:10:49,421
# Hit me!

929
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,793
Turn your fucking mike down!
I can't hear myself think.

930
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:56,053
- # Hit me!
- Stop fucking me around!

931
01:10:56,972 --> 01:11:00,224
- Oh, come on, man.
- I already told you once.

932
01:11:04,188 --> 01:11:05,898
Get him off me, I'll fucking kill him!

933
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,734
You're fucking up everything!

934
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:16,659
Oh, yeah? Forget it!

935
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,792
# Jingle bells # Rudolph smells

936
01:11:23,876 --> 01:11:25,877
# Santa shagged an elf

937
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:29,923
# Tiny Tim plays with his crutch
and thinks it is himself

938
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,099
Happy Christmas!

939
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:42,394
I'm... the husband.

940
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:48,693
So, where'd you get your black eye from?

941
01:11:48,777 --> 01:11:52,280
Well, it's funny you
should say that, actually, because...

942
01:11:52,781 --> 01:11:55,116
- Sorry, what's your name again?
- Clive.

943
01:11:56,535 --> 01:12:01,540
Anyway, so we were at this posh
restaurant... Where were we, Strang?

944
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:02,791
- Oh, Caprice.
- Caprice.

945
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:07,254
Fucking I look over, right? And I say,

946
01:12:07,339 --> 01:12:10,382
"Look, it's Omar fucking Sharif. It is!"

947
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:14,136
So I go all the way over.
And I go over and I says to him,

948
01:12:14,512 --> 01:12:17,056
"Your first film was great
and the rest were shit."

949
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:20,059
And he said,
"I don't give a fuck what you think."

950
01:12:20,143 --> 01:12:22,229
And I said, "Oh, you're a cunt."

951
01:12:22,313 --> 01:12:23,980
And he said, "Fucking come on, then"

952
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,233
and then he fucking smacked me
right in the face.

953
01:12:26,317 --> 01:12:28,360
I mean, talk about overreacting.

954
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,863
Fucking nice fighter.

955
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:34,492
That's the most expensive fist
you'll ever have in your mouth.

956
01:12:34,576 --> 01:12:36,410
Do you want stuffing with that?

957
01:12:36,495 --> 01:12:38,371
Ooh.

958
01:12:55,348 --> 01:13:00,477
Not too much for me, darling.
That's too much. Thanks.

959
01:13:49,363 --> 01:13:53,283
"Home improvement expert

960
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:56,369

01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:13,513
"So he sanded the geezer's winkle off
with a Black & Decker drill."

963
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,154
You're all right, Clive. You know that?

964
01:14:30,574 --> 01:14:32,242
Merry Christmas.

965
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,875
Go on, finish now.
Get on with the fucking thing.

966
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:45,570
Something wrong with you, man?
"Stand up, sit down."

967
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:47,924
- I can't keep up with you.
- Oh, whinge, whinge, whinge.

968
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:49,968
I'm gonna be keeping my eyes on you.

969
01:14:50,178 --> 01:14:52,054
Come out of my face with that thing, man.

970
01:14:52,389 --> 01:14:54,431
And my name is Desmond, not Sparky.

971
01:14:54,892 --> 01:14:57,852
Desi. Desiré. Desiré...

972
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:00,437
- Desmond.
- All right, Desiré.

973
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:02,982
Like your shirt, by the way.

974
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,192
I used to have one like that
in the 1970s, you know.

975
01:15:06,154 --> 01:15:08,571
Oi, come on, give us a smile.
What's wrong with that?

976
01:15:08,697 --> 01:15:10,866
Come inside
and close the blood claat door, man.

977
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:14,577
Fucking Strang, Strang.
Now we get on with the show.

978
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,246
Right. Time is money. Money is time.

979
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:18,707
This is expensive equipment.
Can we do this?

980
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,709
Come on, then.

984
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,458
I can't be dealing with this thing, man.

985
01:15:37,478 --> 01:15:39,521
What was wrong with that? That was perfect.

986
01:15:39,605 --> 01:15:40,689
Do it again. Do it again.

987
01:15:40,773 --> 01:15:43,275
Sorry. Sorry, guys.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

988
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:45,439
Please forgive me.
Please, please, please. All right.

989
01:15:46,863 --> 01:15:50,074
They've got no fucking sense
of humour, that lot, I tell you.

# Noël Coward was a charmer... #

991
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,594
- Try pitching it up a little bit.
- What?

992
01:15:55,622 --> 01:15:57,896
Pitch it. Pitch it.
Listen to the white boy and add pitch.

993
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:00,357
- Pitching? They want pitching.
- Okay, we're gonna do one more.

994
01:16:00,377 --> 01:16:02,503
Fuck 'em. - This is ridiculous, man.

995
01:16:02,588 --> 01:16:04,715
It sound like a bad version of Barry White.

996
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:06,758
- What the fuck did he just say?
- You better...

997
01:16:06,843 --> 01:16:08,719
Chaz. What did he say?

998
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:11,347
All right. One more time.

999
01:16:13,058 --> 01:16:15,017
Just... Just cool the fuck down, man.

1000
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,118

You don't touch
one of my instruments, you...

1003
01:16:37,709 --> 01:16:39,334
That's it.

1004
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:43,046
- Get out of my studio.
- Look, look. Look.

1005
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,342
See, I've got egg all over
my fucking face and I'm all right.

1006
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,719
Jesus. I'll kill you!

1007
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:53,182
- Just calm down.
- Fuck off, mate.

1008
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:55,685
- You is a dead man.
- Where's my fucking manager?

1009
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,979
You're a dead man. You're a dead man.

1010
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:00,899
- Here are your eggs.
- You're a dead man.

1011
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:04,278
The only thing a manager is good for
is doing up your fly

1012
01:17:04,362 --> 01:17:06,113
after a good fucking wank.

1013
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:10,117
Barry White. I'll give you
Barry fucking White, you cunt.

1014

...never try to teach a pig to sing

1015

I know. We all want to escape ourselves.

Where you been?

1026
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,214
Coming and going.

1029
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:37,148
- I need some time off.
- Yeah, don't we all?

01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:41,861
Yeah, I need to, um, get away
and do my own stuff.

1031
01:19:42,488 --> 01:19:44,053
Don't be a doughnut.
There's plenty of time for all that

1032
01:19:44,073 --> 01:19:46,200
- when you've had a proper shave.
- I'm serious.

1033
01:19:48,912 --> 01:19:52,790
- Is there a boozer round here?
- Yeah, round the corner. The Feathers.

1034
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:06,221
So, Baxter.

1035
01:20:06,305 --> 01:20:10,433
I understand you've found it difficult
to fit in at other schools.

1036
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:16,064
Well, our motto here is ex corde vita.

1037
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:19,318
Out of the heart springs life.

1038
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,865
Baxter. Baxter.

1039
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:26,868
Tell me,
what would you like to achieve here?

1040
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,786
What would you like to do?

1041
01:20:29,747 --> 01:20:31,331
Hmm?

1042
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,126
Baxter?

1043
01:20:38,464 --> 01:20:40,048
I'll tell you what.

1044
01:20:40,133 --> 01:20:43,385
I'll leave you alone for a moment,
just to have a little think.

1045
01:20:56,358 --> 01:21:01,571
# Arseholes, bastards,
fucking cunts and pricks

1046
01:21:04,867 --> 01:21:09,955
# Aerosol the bricks

1047
01:21:13,334 --> 01:21:18,339
# A lawless brat from a council flat Oh, oh

1048
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:15,149
Come on, Baxter.

1049
01:22:15,775 --> 01:22:19,654
That's it. Come on, sit up straight.
It's all right. It's okay.

1050
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:23,408
Big, deep breaths. Big, deep breaths.
That's a good boy.

1051
01:22:23,576 --> 01:22:26,328
Come on, you can do it.
Fatten your lungs up.

1052
01:22:26,412 --> 01:22:34,412
In and out. In and out.

1053
01:22:37,215 --> 01:22:38,716
That's it. That's it.

1054
01:22:48,144 --> 01:22:49,602
I'm sorry.

1055
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:54,608
- You're always saying you're sorry.
- Am I?

1056
01:22:55,026 --> 01:22:56,652
Yeah.

1057
01:22:59,447 --> 01:23:02,783
Well, that's 'cause...
Well, that's 'cause I am.

1058
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:06,078
Okay.

1059
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,793
You don't want to be like me, Baxter.

1060
01:23:12,628 --> 01:23:14,587
Please don't try and be like me.

1061
01:23:17,508 --> 01:23:19,092
You want to be like you.

1062
01:23:21,595 --> 01:23:23,596
We're all on our own, remember?

1063
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:27,476
No, Dad. I'm here.

1064
01:23:46,497 --> 01:23:48,248
What's been going on?

1065
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,375
Just the same, you know.

1066
01:23:51,377 --> 01:23:52,836
How are you?

1067
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,424
Sometimes it doesn't work out, okay?

1068
01:24:04,558 --> 01:24:06,851
Sometimes you have to save yourself.

1069
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,792
Did you have a nice time, Bax?

1070
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:35,006
How's your dad?

1071
01:24:38,427 --> 01:24:40,887
"I'm fine, Mummy. Thanks for asking."

1072
01:25:02,912 --> 01:25:08,417
Mum? Mum? Mum!

1073
01:25:28,272 --> 01:25:30,398
Christ almighty.

1074
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:32,859
Language.

1075
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,460
You look terrible.

1076
01:25:51,129 --> 01:25:52,672
Thanks.

1077
01:25:56,969 --> 01:25:58,428
Grapes.

1078
01:26:04,685 --> 01:26:06,603
- I blame myself.
- For the grapes?

1079
01:26:09,315 --> 01:26:13,110
I've not been particularly full
of the joie de vivre.

1080
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:17,823
All the colours have gone.

1081
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:23,121
Wanted the world to go away, too.

1082
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,585
It almost did.

1083
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:33,465
Count the blessings
in the here and now, eh?

1084
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:40,555
Tired, Ian.

1085
01:26:42,017 --> 01:26:43,726
Will you stay?

1086
01:26:47,022 --> 01:26:48,648
Of course I will.

1087
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:06,458
- Okay, everyone. So this is Ian.
- Hello.

1088
01:27:06,543 --> 01:27:09,086
Ian used to be a student here
a few years back.

1089
01:27:09,379 --> 01:27:13,132
And everyone's very excited
about you being here, aren't we?

1090
01:27:13,258 --> 01:27:14,865
Well, thank you very much.
It's nice to be here.

1091
01:27:14,885 --> 01:27:17,303
Ian, I think you said it's okay
if people ask you questions.

1092
01:27:17,388 --> 01:27:19,013
Yeah, go on, pile them in.

1093
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:23,643
Don't all rush at once.

1094
01:27:23,727 --> 01:27:26,271
- Okay, so...
- Who'll go first?

1095
01:27:26,898 --> 01:27:29,608
Finished? Is that it? Right.
Well, I'm off, then.

1096
01:27:29,693 --> 01:27:32,300
Oh, I don't know why they got so quiet
now. They were really noisy before.

1097
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,780
Oh, yeah. Cortez, you wanted
to talk to Ian, didn't you?

1098
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,035
- Hello.
- He says hello.

1099
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,496
Oh, hello, mate. Hello. How you going?
You all right? What you been up to?

1100
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,836
Did you always

1101
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,923
want to be a singer?

1102
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:54,218
- Did you always want to be a...
- Singer.

1103
01:27:55,053 --> 01:27:57,179
Well, I don't really think
of myself as a singer,

1104
01:27:57,263 --> 01:28:00,474
as it happens, I think of myself
as more of an entertainer, really.

1105
01:28:00,558 --> 01:28:02,434
You know,
I always wanted to get up on a stage.

1106
01:28:02,518 --> 01:28:04,520
Give it all that, you know.

1107
01:28:06,398 --> 01:28:09,024
I don't know how much longer
I can get away with it, really,

1108
01:28:09,443 --> 01:28:11,152
'cause I'm a bit of an old chap.

1109
01:28:11,237 --> 01:28:13,821
Anybody else?

1110
01:28:17,618 --> 01:28:21,413
- Do you believe in God?
- What's that?

1111
01:28:21,914 --> 01:28:26,252
Do you believe in almighty God
who created us in His image?

1112
01:28:27,254 --> 01:28:32,591
I believe in good,
which I think is the same thing.

1113
01:28:32,801 --> 01:28:34,761
But do you believe in God? Up in heaven?

1114
01:28:35,303 --> 01:28:38,431
Oh, I used to, but, erm...

1115
01:28:39,767 --> 01:28:41,976
- But not any more.
- Why not?

1116
01:28:44,188 --> 01:28:47,232
Because I think that down here
on Earth, I think that's...

1117
01:28:48,777 --> 01:28:51,028
that's where you got
to get your nut together.

1118
01:28:51,571 --> 01:28:54,490
- Typical.
- Did you just say "typical"?

1119
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:58,911
He's a cheeky little bugger, isn't he?

1120
01:29:02,291 --> 01:29:03,856
You're gonna help me write a song, okay?

1121
01:29:03,876 --> 01:29:05,835
You're going to help me
with the rhythm, right?

1122
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,462
Now, rhythm. Who's tricky with rhythm? Eh?

1123
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:10,715
Right. Rhythm, I'll have you know,

1124
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,448
is the longest word
in the English dictionary

1125
01:29:12,468 --> 01:29:13,927
without any vowels in it, right?

1126
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:17,514
It's very, very special
because you can feel it right here.

1127
01:29:17,848 --> 01:29:20,935
I'm gonna give you a rhythm, all right?
One, two, three, four.

1128
01:29:22,603 --> 01:29:25,481
One, two, three, four. Wait for it.

1129
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:30,820
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

1130
01:29:30,904 --> 01:29:32,363
One, two, three...

1131
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:39,287
All right, louder. Everybody louder.

1132
01:29:40,539 --> 01:29:44,460
Louder! Louder!

1133
01:29:46,879 --> 01:29:50,007
Go crazy! Go crazy with it! Come on.

1134
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:52,259
Louder!

1135
01:29:59,184 --> 01:30:01,394
I think that went really well.
Thank you so much.

1136
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,564
I had a fight with a guy
called Jimmy Coghill behind that tree.

1137
01:30:05,774 --> 01:30:08,110
Did you really? Did you win?

1138
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:09,914
No, he knocked
seven tons of shit out of me.

1139
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:16,159
There was an orderly here by the name
of Hargreaves. Is he still going?

1140
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:20,664
I'm sorry, Ian. It was a while ago,
but Mr Hargreaves took his own life.

1141
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:24,585
He hanged himself up in one of the attics.

1142
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,170
Yeah, it's very sad.

1143
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:38,267
That has made my day, that has.

1144
01:30:46,276 --> 01:30:48,318
- See you.
- Yeah, thanks again.

1145
01:31:00,374 --> 01:31:02,292
I don't know who you are any more.

1146
01:31:05,337 --> 01:31:07,047
But you know what I really can't take?

1147
01:31:10,009 --> 01:31:11,593
It's the hope.

1148
01:31:13,471 --> 01:31:16,223
The hope that it's gonna get better.

1149
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:23,105
It's not, is it?

1150
01:31:29,697 --> 01:31:31,782
Everything's out of joint.

1151
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:37,079
I don't really know
if I've got the bollocks to stop it.

1152
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:47,340
You've got to get out of here, Denny.

1153
01:31:50,219 --> 01:31:52,512
Run away.
And you got to do it all by yourself.

1154
01:31:56,351 --> 01:31:59,728
You'll still be my gracious, my family.

1155
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:06,276
And if you ever forget that,
act sorry for yourself,

1156
01:32:06,361 --> 01:32:08,821
I'll come back
and I'll bleedin' well haunt you.

1157
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,449
You understand?

1158
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:15,411
Hello, it's Graham,
from the Spastics Society.

1159
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:17,122
We spoke on the phone.

1160
01:32:39,396 --> 01:32:44,317
"Full participation and equality
for all." That's the motto.

1161
01:32:44,402 --> 01:32:46,528
This United Nations Year of the Disabled

1162
01:32:46,612 --> 01:32:49,156
is a tremendous opportunity, you know,

1163
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:52,325
to make people really sit up and think.

1164
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:55,829
Of course, we're going to need
all the help we can get, so...

1165
01:32:56,873 --> 01:32:59,105
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if you could get back on top again?

1166
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:02,002
Maybe you get a new song,
maybe another hit single. Who knows?

1167
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,673
- The UN are very keen.
- Are they?

1168
01:33:07,843 --> 01:33:11,387
I understand you've been dabbling
in a spot of acting.

1169
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:14,558
Oh, yeah, I've played a few villains
in me time. Typecast.

1170
01:33:14,642 --> 01:33:17,811
Well, here's an opportunity
to introduce yourself all over again.

1171
01:33:17,895 --> 01:33:20,063
You know, a new fan base, new beginnings.

1172
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:23,150
Oh, dear. Your friend seems to have gone.

1173
01:33:23,234 --> 01:33:25,402
Well, look, you seem to be
in a spot of trouble.

1174
01:33:25,486 --> 01:33:27,446
May I give you a lift?

1175
01:33:31,034 --> 01:33:33,286
Yeah. That'd be great.

1176
01:34:43,194 --> 01:34:45,654
It's really...
It's really great to have you back.

1177
01:34:46,782 --> 01:34:48,532
The prodigal son returns.

1178
01:34:50,911 --> 01:34:56,457
To be a geezer like me, you got to be
a bit of a selfish loony, really.

1179
01:34:56,542 --> 01:35:00,586
Can't bother too much about day and night

1180
01:35:00,796 --> 01:35:02,547
and right and wrong and so forth.

1181
01:35:03,215 --> 01:35:08,428
And occasionally one's behaviour

1182
01:35:09,556 --> 01:35:11,765
makes one ashamed of oneself.

1183
01:35:13,935 --> 01:35:15,602
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1184
01:35:17,064 --> 01:35:22,484
Anyway, this Year of the Disabled...
Got a chance now to get back on top.

1185
01:35:22,569 --> 01:35:24,028
Proper deals going down, so...

1186
01:35:24,988 --> 01:35:29,033
So, what have you got?

1187
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:33,914
# When Tessie Trouble's on patrol

1188
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:39,044
# And Suzie Sadness makes you blue

1189
01:35:40,213 --> 01:35:43,966
# When Lennie Love come through the door

1190
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:02,569
Well, it's not
Sex, Drugs & Rock & Roll, is it?

1191
01:36:02,653 --> 01:36:05,780
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.

1192
01:36:06,824 --> 01:36:08,575
Fucking Year of Disabled.

1193
01:36:09,077 --> 01:36:11,662
I mean, it's like, what?
Like, last year we was fine

1194
01:36:11,747 --> 01:36:14,229
and next year is going to be great,
but this year, just this year,

1195
01:36:14,249 --> 01:36:17,293
oh, we're all gonna be a right bunch
of fucking cripples, aren't we, eh?

1196
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:19,254
Why don't we just form a band?

1197
01:36:19,463 --> 01:36:23,133
I know, I know, we can call ourselves
Spastic and the Autistics.

1198
01:36:24,551 --> 01:36:28,555
Oi, oi! You dribblin', wibblin',
scribblin', cripplin' little

1199
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:32,809
fucking hobblin', wobblin', bobblin'
fantastic spastic!

1200
01:36:36,564 --> 01:36:38,065
I like it.

1201
01:36:38,191 --> 01:36:41,402
And welcome back.
Well, we all like a bit of jazz, don't we?

1202
01:36:41,486 --> 01:36:44,864
And so, turning to our next item
and that's the continuing controversy

1203
01:36:44,948 --> 01:36:47,575
surrounding the United Nations
Year of the Disabled.

1204
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:51,329
We're going to hear from lan Drury,
the housewife's favourite punk rocker,

1205
01:36:51,414 --> 01:36:53,831
the man who put the phrase
"sex & drugs & rock & roll"

1206
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:55,375
into the English language,

1207
01:36:55,459 --> 01:36:58,128
and whose new song Spasticus Autisticus

1208
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:01,256
has been labelled outrageous and offensive.

1209
01:37:01,465 --> 01:37:04,134
We also have with us Graham Hart
from the Spastics Society

1210
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:07,721
to talk about full participation
in the Year of the Disabled.

1211
01:37:07,806 --> 01:37:10,006
- Hello, there.
- So, turning to you first, Ian Drury...

1212
01:37:10,059 --> 01:37:14,187
First of all, it's not Drury
or Dreary or Doory, it's Dury.

1213
01:37:16,065 --> 01:37:19,317
But I would like to say that, yeah,
I think we should all fully participate

1214
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:22,821
in holding Graham down and
chopping off his tiny little bollocks

1215
01:37:22,905 --> 01:37:25,180
- for being a spineless little shit.
- Right, Ian, thank you.

1216
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,681
I don't think this is the time
or the place.

1217
01:37:26,701 --> 01:37:29,954
No, it's not the time or the
place. You're right. It never is, is it?

1218
01:37:30,038 --> 01:37:32,623
I'm terribly sorry.
Will you excuse me, please?

1219
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:36,836
- Bandit!
- No, nobody has banned anything.

1220
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,129
No, you. You're a bandit.
You're a chiseller.

1221
01:37:39,215 --> 01:37:40,904
Well, they don't ban cripples, either,
do they, eh?

1222
01:37:40,924 --> 01:37:42,531
They just make it difficult for them
to function.

1223
01:37:42,551 --> 01:37:44,951
The song is still being played
on current affairs programmes.

1224
01:37:44,971 --> 01:37:46,429
Great! Yeah, that's great!

1225
01:37:46,555 --> 01:37:49,474
Late at night when all the raspberries
are tucked up in bed,

1226
01:37:49,558 --> 01:37:51,392
oh, not doing any harm to anybody.

1227
01:37:51,478 --> 01:37:53,269
Yes, well, it was found offensive.

1228
01:37:53,355 --> 01:37:55,146
How could I go up to somebody, right,

1229
01:37:55,232 --> 01:37:57,339
who's got the same disabilities as me
and be offensive?

1230
01:37:57,359 --> 01:37:59,360
No, not disabled people so much, no.

1231
01:37:59,444 --> 01:38:02,780
Well, it wasn't written for you, was it?
Eh? The walkie-talkies!

1232
01:38:03,031 --> 01:38:05,825
It's a war cry type of item,
like "Spartacus!"

1233
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:08,369
Yes, well, if I remember correctly,
Spartacus was crucified.

1234
01:38:08,454 --> 01:38:10,580
Yeah, I'll be in good company, then,
won't I?

1235
01:38:10,664 --> 01:38:14,084
Look, it was felt that what you've
written just isn't very sympathetic.

1236
01:38:14,168 --> 01:38:17,087
Sympathetic? Life ain't sympathetic, right?

1237
01:38:17,296 --> 01:38:19,672
I'm not Tiny Tim. I am Ian Dury.

1238
01:38:19,758 --> 01:38:22,718
People like me do not want sympathy.
They want respect.

1239
01:38:22,969 --> 01:38:24,512
It's a waste. Okay?

1240
01:38:24,596 --> 01:38:28,516
People felt you had the opportunity
to do something remarkable.

1241
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,644
Your crowning glory, to be remembered
after you've long gone.

1242
01:38:31,728 --> 01:38:33,855
I do not give a shit.

1243
01:38:33,939 --> 01:38:36,733
I don't care if I'm as popular
as a Chinese pig in a synagogue.

1244
01:38:36,817 --> 01:38:40,695
I am not here to be remembered,
I'm here to be alive!

1245
01:38:41,238 --> 01:38:44,699
So you take your Dis-United Nations, right,

1246
01:38:44,784 --> 01:38:48,828
and your Year of Dissembling and
stick it right up your fucking 'arris.

1247
01:38:50,706 --> 01:38:52,082
Cunt.

1248
01:39:11,771 --> 01:39:13,564
Keep your body strong, keep your guard up.

1249
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:15,732
Ian, I need a rest. Ow.

1250
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,659
Clive and I want to be together.

1251
01:39:26,369 --> 01:39:28,268
We don't wanna rush into that.
Look what happened last time.

1252
01:39:28,288 --> 01:39:31,040
Some blokes turn out to be
an absolute nightmare.

1253
01:39:32,918 --> 01:39:34,752
I want a divorce, Ian.

1254
01:39:38,007 --> 01:39:39,507
I still love you.

1255
01:39:40,844 --> 01:39:42,970
It's not about love, silly.

1256
01:39:44,889 --> 01:39:46,682
It's not your choice.

1257
01:39:54,566 --> 01:39:56,025
Let me go.

1258
01:40:02,825 --> 01:40:04,493
Go on, you're fired.

1259
01:40:07,413 --> 01:40:08,997
Darling.

1260
01:40:11,792 --> 01:40:13,335
Getting better.

1261
01:40:16,547 --> 01:40:19,049
You're not gonna shout at me again,
are you?

1262
01:40:36,778 --> 01:40:38,695
You actually been in yet?

1263
01:40:43,618 --> 01:40:45,411
Oh, easy, tiger.

1264
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,293
- How's Mum?
- She's fine. She's gonna be fine.

1265
01:40:53,253 --> 01:40:56,589
Look, it's done.

1266
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:00,177
We had to let Strangler go,

1267
01:41:00,261 --> 01:41:03,055
'cause, well, the dramas backstage

1268
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:04,779
were getting better than the actual show.

1269
01:41:06,225 --> 01:41:08,351
Son, I'm sorry.

1270
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,440
Close your eyes.

1271
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:14,817
Go on. Go on. Close your eyes.

1272
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:19,447
Can you feel that?

1273
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:22,909
Well, that's my hand.

1274
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:30,334
From now until forever,
I will always be there.

1275
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:33,795
Just above your shoulder.

1276
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:36,173
All right?

1277
01:41:56,654 --> 01:41:58,405
I'll tell you what, though.

1278
01:41:58,490 --> 01:42:00,657
I've just been offered a part in a film.

1279
01:42:00,742 --> 01:42:04,870
To play an undernourished villain
who wins in the end through love.

1280
01:42:05,998 --> 01:42:10,668
You could come with.
Be my assistant. If you like.

1281
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:19,761
- Don't you wanna watch me swim?
- Nah. You'll be all right.

1282
01:42:19,928 --> 01:42:23,556
Just remember, keep your head up,

1283
01:42:23,641 --> 01:42:26,226
keep kicking, try not to drown.

1284
01:42:40,409 --> 01:42:45,288
"When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

1285
01:42:47,166 --> 01:42:49,251
"A slave loses his pain.

1286
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:54,882
"Death is the only freedom a slave knows.

1287
01:42:56,134 --> 01:42:58,218
"That's why he's not afraid of it.

1288
01:43:00,597 --> 01:43:02,264
"That's why we'll win..."

1289
01:43:30,796 --> 01:43:32,504
Sit properly.

1290
01:43:35,468 --> 01:43:39,762
- Eat your fish.
- No! It's horrible.

1291
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:45,560
What did you say? You do as you're told.

1292
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:57,991
I said, I ain't eating that,
it's fucking horrible!

1293
01:44:37,617 --> 01:44:39,117
One, two, three...

1294
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:47,201
# I'm Spasticus, Spasticus
Spasticus Autisticus

1295
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:52,089
# I wiggle when I piddle

1296
01:44:52,174 --> 01:44:53,883
# Swim!

1297
01:45:09,025 --> 01:45:11,985
# Get up! Get up!
Get up that dive board! Over!

1298
01:45:12,361 --> 01:45:13,821
# Whoo!

1299
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:21,454
# So place your hard-earned peanuts

1300
01:45:21,538 --> 01:45:24,958
# And thank the Creator

1301
01:45:25,876 --> 01:45:29,045

1307
01:45:55,532 --> 01:45:59,620
# I'm Spasticus, Spasticus

1308
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:01,830
# Dribbling, wiggling, fiddling, nibbling

1310
01:46:07,003 --> 01:46:10,297

- I'm Spasticus!

1311
01:46:10,382 --> 01:46:13,342
# I'm Spasticus!

1312
01:46:13,426 --> 01:46:16,470
- Dad!
- I'm Spasticus!

1313
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:22,602
I'm Spasticus!

1314
01:46:22,978 --> 01:46:26,106
# One, two, three, four Spasticus!

1315
01:46:26,274 --> 01:46:28,191
Ian! Ian! Ian!

1316
01:46:52,927 --> 01:46:55,720
And the moral of the story is

1317
01:46:58,599 --> 01:47:00,350
don't go looking for morals in stories.

1318
01:47:00,435 --> 01:47:03,353
If you want a message,
fuck off down the post office.

1319
01:47:05,566 --> 01:47:10,528
Someone once asked me
if I'd missed anything.

1320
01:47:10,946 --> 01:47:12,572
Well...

1321
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:19,537
if I'd never had a good-looking girl,
a great job, great haircut,

1322
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:21,540
then I could complain,

1323
01:47:21,624 --> 01:47:23,959
but the only thing I've ever missed
is a few buses.

1324
01:47:28,423 --> 01:47:30,341
One last time, Chazanova.

1325
01:47:34,387 --> 01:47:36,180
# Blue Gene baby

1326
01:47:38,976 --> 01:47:43,730
Now, there are a couple of ways
to avoid death.

1327
01:47:45,358 --> 01:47:49,486
And one of them is to be magnificent.

1328
01:47:51,114 --> 01:47:52,781
And this is my favourite way.

1329
01:47:56,828 --> 01:48:01,415
# Skinny white sailor

1330
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,876
