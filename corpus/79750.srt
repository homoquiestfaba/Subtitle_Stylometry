1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,756
Oh, you're so good.

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,957
Oh, yes.
l am the best, baby.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,270
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, that was a tit.

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,669
That is a tit! Yes!

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,591
Oh, you're so big!

6
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,319
Oh, yeah.
That's right, baby.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,516
Doggie wants
to hide his bone.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,670
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,716
Man, would you shut up!

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,109
Hey,Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,031
Sweet dreams.
Good night, Mom.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,509
Kiss good night.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,432
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,988
There's this nature show
that l'm trying to watch.

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,469
And the birds are
all scrambled and l can't even--

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,710
Do me! Yes!

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,711
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,076
The thing must be broken
or l sat on the remote or something.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,469
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- l'm all set, Dad.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,520
No, l think he's tried
to watch some illegal channels.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,434
- lllegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,431
- Spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,714
Oh, baby!

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,155
You know what?
Just give me this, please--

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,913
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this--

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,549
Okay, okay. What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,914
Yes!

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,351
lllegal channels? Shit!

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,830
lf there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that all-woman's channel.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,515
Lifetime supply
of pantihose or some shit.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,751
Did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,515
- Ariel, man, she's so hot!
- She's a mermaid, dude.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,591
Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,309
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's party.
We got to go. lt'll be great.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,030
All that happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,831
Come on, Kevin. Open it.

37
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,037
lt's a big, thick envelope,
Vicky. You got in.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,190
lf you think so,
just open it.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,157
Fine.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,389
''Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,359
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected.''

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,159
- Shut up!
- You got in.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,913
Yes! l love you!

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,711
You think l should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,234
You've worn that shirt for
three days in a row, man!

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,231
Guys, she said it.

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,595
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,875
Holy shit, dude! The ''L'' word?

49
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,394
Cornell's not
that far from ''U'' of''M.''

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,836
lt's only, like, seven hours.
And you get to drive across Canada.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,717
Beautiful country.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,598
Whatever. lt's doable.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,114
What we should do today, in band...

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,875
instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play backwards.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,235
- That'd be so funny!
- Yeah.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,518
You're talking about a post-high school
long-distance relationship.

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,513
-And you and Kevin haven't even done it.
-That's not why we're going out.

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,036
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,190
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and l'm ready.

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,271
lt's got to be
completely perfect.

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,318
l want the right time,
the right moment, the right place--

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,029
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. lt's sex.

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,749
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

64
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,239
- What's goin' on, buddy?
- Same ol'--

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,872
Finch.
You got the Latin homework?

66
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,514
lt means, ''My dog ate it.''
lt's Latin.

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,115
- lt's a Latin joke.
- Latin.Just drink your coffee.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,360
- No,Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,431
lt's mochaccino.
lt's not coffee.

70
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,556
'Nova!

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,632
- What's up, dude?
- Comin' to the party, you fuckface?

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,995
Depends if my date
wants to stop by.

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,117
- l'm workin' on somethin' new.
- l got an idea about something new.

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,430
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks...

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,239
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

76
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,915
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,309
Oh, right.
l'll see you guys tonight.

78
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,915
l'll look for you
in the no-fucking section.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,908
l'm shooting for a 9:00 E.T.A.
Beer in hand by five after.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,116
Breath check.

81
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,678
- l wish you wouldn't do that.
- You got something up your sleeve?

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,433
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,511
l have a serious question
to ask you guys.

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,070
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,278
Do you think she would prefer...

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,188
laid-back Jim, or...

87
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,029
cool, hip Jim?

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,398
l don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

89
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,590
You're the one with the girlfriend,
and you're still stranded on third base.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,513
Hey, at least l know
what third base feels like.

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,434
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. What are you talking about?

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,397
Guys, uh--

93
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
What exactly does
third base feel like?

94
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,671
You wanna
take this one?

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,433
Like warm apple pie.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,956
Apple pie, huh?

97
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,794
McDonald's or home-made?

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,350
Gentlemen, destiny awaits.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,514
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

100
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,077
Holy!

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,868
Nadia! Buenos dias.
Glad you could make it.

102
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,951
l'll be back for you later.

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,349
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

104
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,590
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,513
The keg's back there! Enjoy!

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,479
Vicky,Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,278
Bitches!

108
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,032
- Sherman!
- Hey!

109
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,509
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,353
Fellas! What's goin' on?

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,831
Sherman. Not much.
Just scopin' the babes.

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,708
lndeed!
Some fine ladies here, boys.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,792
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

114
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,189
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

115
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,477
Full strategic arsenal
ready for deployment.

116
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,596
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,671
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

118
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,591
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,197
lt's time she experienced
the Shermanator.

120
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,475
Yeah, okay, Sherman.
Whatever.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,439
l'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

122
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,876
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

123
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,270
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- l'll be back!

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,237
- Hopeless.
- Completely.

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,276
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.

126
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,113
Oh, shit.
Guys-- Guys--

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,670
There's Nadia
and she just looked at me.

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,274
- She just looked at me.
- Why don't you go talk to her?

129
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,229
You're right, Kev.
l should just go talk to her.

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,196
l could do that.
Sure.

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,195
That's great!

132
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,679
See ya later.

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,999
We're here for the party.

134
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,072
What party? There's no party.

135
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,518
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,074
So, what's your major?

137
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,390
Post-modern feminist thought.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,438
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

139
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,317
Sure.

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,839
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

141
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,151
Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.

142
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,869
- Suck me, beautiful.
- What did you just say?

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,712
Suck me, beautiful.

144
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,592
My friends call me '''Nova,''
as in Casanova.

145
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,999
That's pathetic.

146
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,316
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

147
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,277
There's just some things
you need to learn.

148
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,555
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

149
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,756
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

150
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,638
and spout off cheeseball lines
to be romantic.

151
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,076
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,869
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

153
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,033
Come on, Casanova.
l'll take you back to your friends.

154
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,119
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

155
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,795
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

156
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,189
l mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

157
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,350
Damn, my farts fuckin' stink!

158
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,752
Dude, you gotta take a shit!
You smell like a Yeti!

159
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,319
Or not.

160
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,038
Just relax.

161
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,998
You actually said that?

162
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,512
Shut up!

163
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,591
You did a hell of a lot better
than l did with Nadia.

164
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,513
Oh, thanks,Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

165
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,989
Hey, no problem, 'Nova.

166
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,834
Hey, don't call me 'Nova any more.
l'm a fraud.

167
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,229
You guys are pathetic.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,311
l'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

169
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,674
''Suck me, beautiful''!

170
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,948
- Let me know.
- Okay.

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,270
Keep going.

172
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,749
l should be able
to talk to girls.

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,070
l'm articulate.

174
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,310
You know, l got a 720
on my S.A.T. verbal.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,516
Bullshit.
There's no way.

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,309
l kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,470
Copious.

178
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,437
Verisimilitude.

179
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,633
Oh, now.

180
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,431
Suck me, beautiful!

181
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,193
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

182
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,192
Please, vacate the room.

183
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,316
You are such a jerk.

184
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,632
God, l can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

185
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,115
And you got a keg too!

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,919
- Wow!
- lndeed.

187
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,793
Oh, wait.
l left my beer downstairs.

188
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,110
No. No.
Here, babe!

189
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,149
Thanks.

190
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,357
You're really beautiful. Oh--

191
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,557
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,480
You know what? l don't know
if l want to be doing this.

193
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,312
Doing what?

194
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,119
You know, if we hook up tonight...

195
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,033
tomorrow l'll just be some girl
you go telling your friends about.

196
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,233
No way!

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,074
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

198
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,149
Look.

199
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,554
Sarah, l wouldn't go telling stories
or anything about you.

200
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,031
l promise.
So, just relax.

201
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,113
Take it slow,
and let the good times roll.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,595
- Okay.
- All right.

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,997
What's wrong?

204
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,035
What's wrong?
What is it?

205
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,438
Xenophobic.

206
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,189
- Regurgitation.
- l know that one.

207
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,431
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

208
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,909
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,070
l mean, have you just
never had one with Kevin...

210
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,037
or have you never
had one, period?

211
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,235
l've had one.

212
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,590
- l think.
- Okay.

213
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,309
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

214
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,277
You never even had one manually?

215
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,477
-l've never tried it.
-You've never double-clicked your mouse?

216
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,198
Nice!

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,191
Jesus! How much did you drink?

218
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,635
Hey, Stifler?

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,518
- How's the pale ale?
- Fuck you!

220
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,832
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

221
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,550
Shit. l cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
- Dude, that chick's a ''MlLF.''
- What the hell is that?

223
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,631
M-l-L-F-- Mom l'd like to fuck.

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,553
Yeah, dude!
Oh, yeah!

225
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,552
- Yeah! MlLF!
- Hey, guys.

226
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,111
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

227
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,112
Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

228
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,749
l got company,
if you know what l mean?

229
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,669
She's hot!

230
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,676
lf Sherman has sex before l do,
l'm gonna be really pissed.

231
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,791
The Shermanator?

232
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,191
Come on, man.

233
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,630
MlLF! MlLF!

234
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,713
MlLF! MlLF! Hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

235
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,035
Oh, my God, bro, dude.

236
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,750
Enough of this blow job bullshit.
l gotta get laid already.

237
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,593
That's nice.
Really, really nice.

238
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,797
- Can l have a ride?
- Sure.

239
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,394
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

240
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,194
Yeti! l am the Yeti!

241
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,677
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch, where were you last night?

242
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,955
What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,157
l was going for a fashionably late
entrance, and l was too late.

244
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
So, no ladies left.

245
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,314
lt was a very
special night, very special.

246
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,352
Guys. Guys.

247
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,037
- l'll never forget this.
- l'll never forget it, either.

248
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,917
Thank you.

249
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,717
Fellas, say goodbye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

250
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,394
l am now a man.

251
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,040
l highly recommend
you join the club.

252
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,317
We were doin' the wild thing
all night.

253
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,277
l'm exhausted.

254
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,238
l don't get it.
How the hell did you do that?

255
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,837
lt was just my time.
lt was just my time.

256
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,476
Best of luck to you boys.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,753
- l cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

258
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,592
We should be happy
for Sherman.

259
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,914
No, we shouldn't be.

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,719
You know, l put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

261
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,360
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

262
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,000
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

263
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,436
How the hell am l supposed
to become Mr Sensitive Man?

264
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,035
We're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

265
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,429
They probably have special dorms
for people like us.

266
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,071
All right. l got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

267
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,879
lt's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

268
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,871
lt's more than an agreement.

269
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,030
- A bet?
- A pact.

270
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,270
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

271
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,035
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

272
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,432
Dude, it's not like l haven't
been trying to get laid.

273
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,308
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone to spot you.

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,109
Someone to keep you motivated.
That's what we can do for each other.

275
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,760
We'll be there
to keep each other on track.

276
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,149
Separately we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together...

277
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,231
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

278
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,074
Their tiger-style kung fu is strong,
but our dragon-style will defeat it.

279
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,717
Guys!

280
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,473
The Shaolin masters from
East and West must unite!

281
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,994
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

282
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,710
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

283
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,234
We must make a stand,
here and now.

284
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,830
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

285
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,833
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

286
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,276
This is our day.
This is our time.

287
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,478
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

288
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,516
- Amen.
- l like that.

289
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,275
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

290
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,828
We will get laid!

291
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,913
The sex.

292
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,195
lt's got to be valid,
consensual sex.

293
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,477
No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

294
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,913
Busted.

295
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,594
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

296
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,671
- Dude, prom sucks.
- l know.

297
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,751
But you gotta think
about it this way.

298
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,628
l mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

299
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,598
He's right. lt's like
tradition or something.

300
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,399
- Like the Rose Bowl.
- So, that gives us--

301
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,675
Exactly three weeks to the day.

302
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
- We're gonna do this.
- To the next step!

303
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,910
Next step!

304
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,634
Well, did you get the flowers?

305
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,951
You'll get her back soon enough.

306
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,190
- You think so?
- She likes you.

307
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,429
- l like her too.
- Do you love her?

308
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,279
You know what?
You can't really ask me that.

309
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,158
lf you want to get her in the sack,
just tell her you love her.

310
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,038
- That's how l was duped.
- Look,Jessica.

311
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,190
l don't want
to dupe her.

312
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,639
All right. What you need to do
is learn how to press a girl's buttons.

313
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,711
You have to give her
what she's never had.

314
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,076
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

315
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,072
-:Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

316
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,513
You got it, stud.

317
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,433
Well, l'm pretty sure
that l've given her a--

318
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,274
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time--

319
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,158
- No.
- Oh, man.

320
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,513
Look, kid, it's up to you.
The big ''L'' or the big ''O.''

321
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,752
Dickhead!
You gotta see this.

322
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,753
Do you believe in magic
In a young girl's heart

323
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,196
How the music can free her
whenever it starts

324
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,512
And it's magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel--

325
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,989
What did you cocks do to him?

326
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,753
I'll tell you about the magic
It'll free your soul

327
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,992
But it's like tryin'to tell
a stranger 'bout rock 'n'roll

328
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,150
Great.
See you next time.

329
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,638
Hey, guys.
Came to watch me in action?

330
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,280
- l think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

331
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,112
l think you need
your balls reattached.

332
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,636
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

333
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,676
This place
is an untapped resource.

334
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,389
l mean, check it out.
These vocal jazz girls are hot.

335
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,119
Why the hell is he joining
jazz choir so late?

336
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,795
Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

337
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,440
You guys,
we don't even know him.

338
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,472
You dipshit!

339
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,519
You're expecting to score with some
goody-goody choirgirl priss?

340
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,479
These chicks don't know me. l can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

341
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,676
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

342
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,672
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

343
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,637
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

344
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,872
l don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

345
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,872
Just a second!

346
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,909
Come in. Come in.

347
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,195
Oh,Jim, you're here.

348
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,511
l was just walking
by your room and--

349
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,479
And, you know, l was thinking, ''Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

350
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,869
a little father-son chat.''

351
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,119
Oh! l almost forgot.
l bought some magazines.

352
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,275
Do you just want to flip
to the centre section?

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,868
Well, this is the--
this is the female form.

354
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,758
And they have
focused on the breasts...

355
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,391
which are used primarily
to feed young infants...

356
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,916
and also in foreplay.

357
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,989
Right.

358
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,231
This is--
This is Hustler.

359
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,869
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

360
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,556
Now, they have decided to focus
more on the pubic region--

361
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,315
- Right.
- The whole groin area.

362
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,029
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

363
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,351
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying...

364
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,796
''Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?''

365
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,075
- You see?
- Right.

366
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,471
Shaved is a magazine
l'm not too familiar with...

367
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,031
but, again,
if you flip to the centre...

368
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,031
section--

369
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,477
Well, you see the detail that
they go into in this picture here.

370
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,475
lt almost looks like a tropical plant
or something, underwater thing.

371
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,028
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

372
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,395
- Don't say, ''Oh--''
- l know what a clitoris is.

373
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,675
You've been there and back.
You know everything.

374
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,197
l've learned about it in Sex Ed.
l don't need you to talk about clitoris.

375
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,840
You know what?
l'm sorry, okay?

376
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,196
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
- l'm sorry.

377
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,829
l shouldn't have got hot there.
You know what l'm going to do,Jim?

378
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,275
l'm going to just
leave these books here...

379
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,670
for you to peruse at your--
at your leisure.

380
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,192
Wait!

381
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,271
Well, safer than a tube sock.

382
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,036
- Okay, that was good.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,356
- See you at dinner.
- Yeah. l'll see you at dinner.

384
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,997
So, Finch, this is your plan?

385
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,311
You know, l don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

386
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,436
Kevin, l'm sure
that they're not.

387
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,035
Actually, there is one small matter that
l need to ask for your cooperation in...

388
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,998
- in the spirit of this pact.
- What do you need?

389
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,072
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

390
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,869
Look, l gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

391
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,633
You know, Finch,
it's senior year.

392
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,950
Don't you think it's time you learned
how to take a dump at school?

393
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,237
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

394
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,990
Excuse me.
That's Paul Finch, right?

395
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,236
You've seen him
in the locker room, right?

396
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,157
My friends, they want
to know: ls it true?

397
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,834
You know, that he's equipped.

398
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,833
l have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

399
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,229
l mean--

400
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,437
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

401
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,557
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

402
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,551
All right. Thanks.

403
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,189
Oh, man!

404
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,156
So l was thinking maybe you could give
me some advice, brother to brother.

405
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,277
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin'to make her--

406
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,349
Orgasm?

407
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,159
- Yeah.
- What's good here?

408
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,356
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

409
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,793
How do you do that?

410
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,075
Never mind that.
Pay attention.

411
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,357
ls that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

412
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,477
lt'd be good to be able to,
you know, return the favour.

413
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,869
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

414
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,077
Good. That's what l wanted to hear.
Now you qualify.

415
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,755
- Qualify for what?
- You've just inherited the Bible.

416
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,831
It originally started
as a sex manual...

417
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,151
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

418
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,800
Each year it got passed on
to one East student who was worthy.

419
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,839
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

420
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,188
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

421
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,078
So now you know. Good luck.

422
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,390
- If you believe in magic
- Magic

423
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,277
Don't you bother to choose

424
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,397
If it's jug band music
or rhythm and blues

425
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,677
Just go and listen
It will start with a smile

426
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,514
That won't wipe off your face
no matter how hard you try

427
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,353
Your feet start tappin'
And you can't seem to find

428
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,749
How you got there

429
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,400
Do you believe in magic

430
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,590
Yeah, magic

431
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,830
What was that?

432
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,388
- Sorry.
- No, it was good.

433
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,996
Well, it--
lt came from the heart.

434
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,914
Keep it coming.
All right, people, good work.

435
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,949
Don't forget. The state competition's
a couple of weeks away, so keep on it.

436
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,749
- Not bad, Chris.
- Really?

437
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,189
Thanks.
Heather, right?

438
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,513
You've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

439
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,071
Right. l feel like l've discovered
this whole new side of me.

440
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,594
l mean, music is so expressive.

441
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,990
Okay, l agree, but aren't
you supposed to be out...

442
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,675
trying to decapitate someone
with your lacrosse stick or something?

443
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,548
Oh, sure, sure. You know,
l know what people think.

444
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,110
lt's like, ''Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player.''

445
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,318
l also play football, by the way,
but that's not all that l am, you know?

446
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,118
Of course, l didn't--

447
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,478
lt really bothers me when people
try to pigeonhole me like that.

448
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,712
You? You think
l don't get that?

449
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,997
God, it's like just because l don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

450
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,232
that people say, ''Look , there's this
Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss.''

451
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,436
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

452
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,794
Well, the same things you do...

453
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,633
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

454
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,950
Why? What do you think l do?

455
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,238
l just realized that l don't know
anything about you. l was interested.

456
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,992
What do you want to know?

457
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,753
You know, stuff about you.

458
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,516
All right.

459
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,873
Mom, l'm home!

460
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,192
Oh, yeah.

461
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,710
lt's not what it looks like.

462
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,360
Well, we'll just tell
your mother that--

463
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,351
that we ate it all.

464
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,149
Goal by number eight,
Chris Ostreicher.

465
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,876
- Nice game.
- Good game.

466
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,273
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

467
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,636
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

468
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,154
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

469
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,198
- Chris--
- You can call me Oz.

470
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,555
- Do l have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

471
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,596
- What's your middle name?
- Forget it.

472
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,150
- l won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will l.

473
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,076
So, l had this thought and--

474
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,390
lt may seem like
it's way out of left field.

475
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,391
l don't know if you can...

476
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,789
but since l'm not going with
anybody, l thought that maybe--

477
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,440
Those guys sucked ass!

478
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,670
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

479
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,348
Well, l was asking
Chris to prom.

480
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,237
So, do you want to go?

481
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,710
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

482
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,790
Just don't expect Oz
to pay for the limo!

483
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,917
Stifler, fuck!
l mean--

484
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,878
Why do you got to be
so insensitive all the time?

485
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,472
What?

486
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,791
Whatever. Look, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

487
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,269
On Lake Michigan.

488
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,840
Wait up, you pussies!

489
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,469
Well, l gotta hit
the showers now...

490
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,155
but l think this is gonna
be really, really good.

491
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,674
Yeah. Me too.

492
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,079
All right.

493
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,353
- Happenin' Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

494
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,876
What d'ya say, fellas? l just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

495
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,554
Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

496
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,514
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

497
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,989
Spank me!
Spank me!

498
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,957
Hit that high ''C''!

499
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,714
What's goin' on?

500
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,115
l was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

501
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,953
l'm a total idiot.
l mean, a fool, a buffoon.

502
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,429
l think shithead
really says it.

503
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,832
You're right. l'm a shithead,
and l want to make it up to you.

504
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,388
Oh, yeah? How?

505
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,360
Vicky, shh.
Your parents are downstairs.

506
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,432
- Kevin, don't stop!
-Just a second.

507
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,953
Hon, can you tell Vic
to come on down for supper?

508
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,758
Holy shit!

509
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,628
Shh. You know there's
no lock on your door?

510
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,271
l'm coming!
l'm coming!

511
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,912
- Oh,Jim!
- Dad.

512
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,390
l was just looking at
the old family portrait out here.

513
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,994
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

514
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,435
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

515
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,318
Jim, l want to talk
about masturbation.

516
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,753
l just want you to know that
it's a perfectly normal thing.

517
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,910
And l have to admit,
you know...

518
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,278
l did a fair bit of masturbating
when l was a little younger.

519
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,319
l used to call it
''stroking the salami.''

520
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,709
You know,
''pounding the ol' pud.''

521
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,430
l never did it with baked goods.
But you know your Uncle Mort?

522
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,829
He ''pinched the one-eyed snake''
six times a day.

523
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,959
See, it's like practise
for the big game.

524
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,032
You see?
lt's like-- lt's like...

525
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,271
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

526
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,148
Which can be fun.
lt can be fun, but it's not a game.

527
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,515
- Right.
- lt's not a game.

528
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,910
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

529
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,356
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah, l want a partner.

530
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,271
- You do?
- l want a partner.

531
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,239
Want a partner.
Good. Good.

532
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,470
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

533
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,790
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

534
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,269
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

535
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,638
You see, Hal is going through a rite
of passage, much like you all are.

536
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,952
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

537
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,156
So, does your tongue cramp up?

538
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,198
Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.

539
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,831
Wow. That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

540
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,870
All right. Class dismissed.

541
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,835
Still questing after
the Holy Grail, huh, guys?

542
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,438
- Hey, where's Finch?
- He went home to take a shit.

543
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,638
l don't get it. How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

544
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,996
- What reputation?
- Observe.

545
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,914
Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

546
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,230
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

547
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,114
You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

548
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,549
lf you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

549
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,629
Bye.

550
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,799
Okay. Explain.

551
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,713
l can't. l don't know
how he's doing it.

552
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,909
l guess that just
leaves Jim trailing.

553
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,355
-Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

554
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,510
Yeah, l know.
l'm working on it.

555
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,309
James? You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

556
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,073
Me? Yes. No--

557
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,353
Yes, l am.

558
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,635
Perhaps you could help me
with my studies.

559
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,793
Yeah. Absolutely.
That would be great sometime.

560
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,237
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, l have ballet practise.

561
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,357
Perhaps l could come
by your house afterwards?

562
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,590
l could change clothes
at your place.

563
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,799
Yeah. l suppose
that would be okay.

564
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,677
Sure.

565
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,709
Nice car!

566
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,109
- l'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

567
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,431
No, l like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

568
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,318
That was a bad idea.
l'm sorry l invited you.

569
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,392
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

570
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,756
l asked you because l thought
you might actually be worth going with.

571
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,833
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

572
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,388
Wait! l don't understand.

573
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,950
l saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

574
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,632
l wasn't makin' fun of you.

575
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,188
Give me a break.
You're so full of it.

576
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,149
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

577
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,276
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

578
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,955
What am l gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the lnternet?

579
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,350
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

580
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,589
No. l cannot do that to her.

581
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,956
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

582
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,952
lf you don't have the guts
to photograph a naked chick...

583
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,632
how you gonna sleep with one?

584
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,234
l don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

585
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,630
See, even Shit-break
knows you should do it.

586
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,871
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

587
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,871
and tell me the address.

588
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,633
You can send me
the address too.

589
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,712
l'll save you a seat.

590
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,828
How sweet it is
to be loved by you, by you

591
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,480
I needed the shelter
of someone's arms

592
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,312
Someone's arms

593
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,029
- There you were
- You were

594
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,477
I needed someone
who understands my ups and downs

595
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,471
There you were

596
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,996
Okay, that was good,
but l want to thicken up that solo.

597
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,958
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and l want that part to smoke.

598
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,235
Yeah, l know,
my timing's off.

599
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,835
lt's not that. l think it'll work better
as a duet with a tenor part.

600
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,797
l'll do it.

601
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,594
- Dick.
- l'll do it.

602
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,591
Great. See you tomorrow.

603
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,197
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause l want to.

604
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,511
Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

605
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,591
You better practise.

606
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,429
Come in.

607
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,471
Jim? There's a--
a young lady here to see you.

608
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,710
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi,James. Ready to study?

609
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,394
He's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm.

610
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,879
Dad.

611
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,791
He's not one of those
nerdy guys--

612
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,199
Dad!

613
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,556
Well, l'll let you two
hit the books.

614
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,432
You want a beer?

615
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,149
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

616
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,552
Steve! lt's my computer,
and l wanna use it!

617
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,073
Shut up!

618
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,720
You need to change, right?

619
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,792
- Uh, do you mind?
- No, not at all.

620
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,111
Please, you know.
Just go ahead and get changed.

621
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,431
l'll go downstairs
and start studying up.

622
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,916
There he goes.

623
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,228
Now we're in business.

624
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,516
- Back in a sec.
-Jimmy, honey--

625
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,114
Here she is.

626
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,196
- Did l miss anything?
- No. You are just in time.

627
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,556
- Oh. Oh!
- This is incredible.

628
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,234
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

629
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,198
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, Jeez.

630
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,511
God bless the lnternet.

631
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,837
- Do it. Take it off.
- Oh, my God.

632
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,514
Oh, thank you, God,
for this wonderful, wonderful day.

633
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,034
She takes her vitamins.

634
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,831
Stop hyperventilating.

635
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,276
This is, like,
the coolest thing l've ever seen.

636
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,918
l know.

637
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,040
This is definitely one
of Stifler's best ideas ever.

638
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,551
What is she--
She's touching my stuff.

639
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,200
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Let her touch.

640
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,158
- She's going through my stuff!
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

641
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,835
- No, no.
- Nice collection there.

642
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,480
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna--

643
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,074
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

644
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,754
She reads the articles.

645
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,315
ls she?

646
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,118
She's goin' downstairs.

647
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,679
- Oh, my God!
-Jackpot, baby!

648
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,911
- Can you believe this?
- l would have never known!

649
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,357
l have an announcement to make.
There is a gorgeous woman...

650
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,476
masturbating on my bed!

651
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,993
Thank you, Nadia!

652
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,755
lf you ever had a chance
with Nadia, this is it.

653
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,513
What am l
supposed to do, Kev?

654
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,192
Seduce her.

655
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,232
What the hell would l say?

656
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,517
Go over there and ask her
if she needs an extra hand.

657
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,953
That's stupid, Kev.

658
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,349
That's not stupid!
You're stupid if you don't go!

659
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,317
Come on!
Get over there!

660
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,550
- Get goin'! She's prime.
- Get out of here!

661
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,155
- She's waitin' for you.
- Okay, l'm goin'.

662
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,832
- Go!
- l'm goin'!

663
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,751
- Go!
- Oh, shit.

664
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,271
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

665
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,593
Oh, boy. Oh, God.
Oh, no.

666
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,909
Hello?

667
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,753
Looks like Jim addressed
the e-mail wrong.

668
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,556
What?

669
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,757
lt went out to every mailbox
in the East High directory.

670
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,717
God, how juvenile.

671
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,631
Hey, guys!

672
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,868
Check this out!
Oh, my God!

673
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,438
Please, God, let this be it.

674
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,192
Please?

675
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,274
Somebody's goin' in.

676
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,995
Here you go.
That's what you need to do.

677
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,116
- That guy's in my trig class.
- Oh, no.

678
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,556
Looks like you could
use an extra hand.

679
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,959
Jim!

680
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,793
- Oh, God.
- Shame on you.

681
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,351
Yeah, shame on me.
l'm so sorry. l'm just gonna go.

682
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,638
You have seen me.

683
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,678
Now it's my turn to see you.

684
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,479
Strip!

685
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,629
- Strip?
- Slowly.

686
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,674
You mean, like,
strip strip?

687
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,988
For me.

688
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,116
- What is he talkin' to her about?
- l have no idea.

689
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,636
Come on,Jim. People are viewing.
Get to business.

690
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,233
Perfect!

691
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,553
- Move,James! Move!
- Yeah, yeah. Move.

692
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,430
Go, trig boy! lt's yer birthday!

693
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,953
- No!
- Please, God.

694
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,349
- Come on.
- What's going on?

695
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,998
- Yes!
- All right. Get in the mix!

696
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,229
There.

697
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,478
This is disgusting.

698
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,075
What the fuck is this?

699
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,351
Cut it out, man!

700
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,674
Freak.

701
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,790
Did not just
take out that chair.

702
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,715
- Yup, he took out the chair.
- More, more, you bad boy!

703
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,634
Oh, yeah, l'm naughty.
l'm naughty, baby.

704
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,676
Oh, God!

705
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,476
Now, come to me.

706
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,034
Oh, yeah.

707
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,551
- Here we go.
- He's in.

708
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,392
This just got a hell of a lot better.

709
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,359
- Be gentle.
- Okay.

710
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,914
- You've done that before, dude.
- Houston, we have a problem.

711
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,592
What happened?
What did he do?

712
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,749
He blew it.

713
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,314
- l guess l'll be going now.
- No, no.

714
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,598
l'm not done, Nadia.
l've got reserves.

715
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,069
Nadia, please, please.
l'm begging you.

716
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,072
Well, l do like
your dirty magazines.

717
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,358
You do? Okay, well,
did you see this one?

718
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,791
This here is your more
exotic, risque magazine.

719
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,791
- He's pullin' out the porn.
- He's desperate.

720
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,711
Jim, just wait till she leaves.

721
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,268
Very arousing women.
They arouse me--

722
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,237
They arouse me
very, very much.

723
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,949
But, uh--
But not as arousing as you.

724
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,554
Oh,Jim!

725
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,232
Oh, God!

726
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,639
Yes!

727
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,756
He's ruining daisy!

728
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,594
So, uh, ''shaved''
is the expression?

729
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,349
Holy shit.

730
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,793
Holy shit!

731
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,518
Holy shit!

732
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,160
- Holy shit!
- Touch me,Jim.

733
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,635
Here.

734
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,229
- Again?
- Not again.

735
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,437
- Not again, man!
- ls that possible?

736
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,829
What a loser.

737
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,111
I needed someone to understand
my ups and downs

738
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,636
There you were

739
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,439
With sweet love
and devotion

740
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,873
Deeply touching
my emotion

741
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,030
I just wanna stop

742
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,350
And thank you, baby

743
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,789
- Hey, minute man!
- Shut up.

744
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,348
You're supposed
to be supportive.

745
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,274
You think you still
got a chance with Nadia?

746
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,033
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'Net.

747
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,079
- l really don't think they liked it.
- How do you know that?

748
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,151
She's already on a plane back home.

749
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,829
You know, guys? Maybe l'm just
not good with girls, period.

750
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,230
No, really. Like l was born
without that part of the brain.

751
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,311
l mean, l can't talk to girls.

752
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,391
And when l do talk
to them, l screw it up.

753
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,472
Come prom, those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

754
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,710
And one time at band camp...

755
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,870
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights...

756
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,872
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

757
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,872
And this one time,
we all lost our music...

758
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,077
and we were supposed to play
this song, but we didn't know it...

759
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,869
so we just made it up
and we kept playing and playing...

760
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,748
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

761
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,274
So, you're pissed
about somethin', huh?

762
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,830
You know what l do when l'm angry?
l just play some Bach on my flute.

763
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,673
lt's so relaxing.
l learned to do that at band camp.

764
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,751
Hold on.

765
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,593
You have no idea
why l'm angry?

766
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,318
Because we have a test tomorrow?

767
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,190
Sometimes l get cranky when
l know l have a big test to study for.

768
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,114
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- l thought so.

769
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,794
- Because this one time at band camp--
- What's your name?

770
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,677
- Michele.
- Okay.

771
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,990
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

772
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,719
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

773
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,155
Yes. Seriously.

774
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,676
Are we going to Stifler's party after?
Because that would be so cool.

775
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,069
Sure, whatever you want.

776
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,833
Cool! We're gonna have
such a good time.

777
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,914
lt'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire--

778
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,516
- How'd you know l was here?
- Stifler told me.

779
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,876
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, l needed to find you.

780
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,996
We're gonna have
to work on that song.

781
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,958
Okay. l'm glad you came by.

782
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,156
So you work nights?

783
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,079
- My dad's the manager.
- Really?

784
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,118
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

785
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,834
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.

786
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,559
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

787
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,359
l don't wanna write
all those extra essays they make you do.

788
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,715
l mean, how am l
supposed to know...

789
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,997
what my ''most emotionally
significant moment'' was?

790
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,437
So when my ''U'' of''M'' acceptance came in
December, l just said the hell with it.

791
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,431
- Onions?
- What?

792
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,954
You want onions?

793
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,871
Oh, no, thank you.

794
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,028
So what are you
gonna major in?

795
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,678
State's got a good
business school...

796
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,990
and l could probably
walk on to the lacrosse team.

797
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,789
Well, you've got it pretty
figured out, then, huh?

798
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,350
l mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

799
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,398
what am l gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player?

800
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,311
l really have no idea.

801
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,551
Thank God.
l thought l was the only one.

802
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,517
Well, you're not.

803
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,876
So we're gonna be
close next year.

804
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,351
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

805
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,395
- What are you talkin' about?
- l can't go to the prom with you.

806
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,471
l'm holding out for someone else.

807
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,676
You gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

808
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,912
l know it's a long shot,
but l figure Paul Finch might ask me.

809
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,834
Finch. Shit-brick.

810
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,514
Oh, gosh.
l forgot.

811
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,909
You look okay.

812
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,276
l mean, the scars
healed really well.

813
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,237
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

814
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,837
What was that all about?

815
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,480
He's still embarrassed
because Finch kicked his ass.

816
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,118
Who told you that?

817
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,236
What do you mean,
''no comment''?

818
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,278
- Did you two hook up?
- Are you kidding? No.

819
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,750
Then how did
all this get started?

820
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,912
Well, l guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

821
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,037
That reputation of his
isn't going anywhere. Cheese, please.

822
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,953
Finch comes up to me
and says, ''Jessica...

823
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,554
l need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera.''

824
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,870
So l said, ''All right.
Pay me 200 bucks...

825
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,713
and l'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed.''

826
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,439
So he did, and l did.

827
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,511
- That actually works?
- Well, of course.

828
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,955
Naturally,
l embellished a little bit.

829
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,429
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

830
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,351
No, l didn't hear that one.

831
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,908
That one was my favourite.

832
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,911
Do that cheerleader.

833
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,356
- Thank you, baby
- She wants me. She calls me up--

834
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,718
How sweet it is
to be loved by you

835
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,792
Oh, my God, you're gay!

836
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,711
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

837
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,872
No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.

838
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,475
lf you try that at M.S.U. this Saturday,
l'll kick your ass.

839
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,471
Our last game
is this Saturday.

840
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,596
Yeah, well, shit.

841
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,313
l've got this lacrosse game. lt's
really important. lt's our last game.

842
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,995
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time l really wanna kick their ass.

843
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,674
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State...

844
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,194
which means afterwards
l'll be able to stop by.

845
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,191
So you can't sing
at the competition.

846
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,874
Heather, l'm sorry.
l totally blew it.

847
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,476
lt's okay. You should do
what makes you happy.

848
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,589
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

849
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,032
So, l guess
l'll see you later?

850
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,237
Hey, Kevin.

851
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,110
- You seen Shit-break lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?

852
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,191
Me? Nothing.

853
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,475
See, l'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

854
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,870
But, l'll tell you
one thing, though.

855
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,032
l don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school any more.

856
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,031
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

857
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,948
Oh, God!

858
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,150
Jesus.

859
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,674
Right this way, sir.

860
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,558
Oh, God.

861
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,590
lt's gonna be fun.

862
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,114
lt's just gonna be some crappy band
and stupid decorations.

863
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,670
You're just saying that because prom's
a week away and you don't have a date.

864
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,115
No, l don't want a date.

865
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,478
Finch is goin' stag
and so am l.

866
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,677
God, he's like so refined.

867
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,797
You think that
older woman thing is true?

868
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,031
Yeah, it's true.
lt was Stifler's mom.

869
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,191
Joanie, was that you?

870
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,475
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

871
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,993
Kev? l think we've come...

872
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,516
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.

873
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,431
Maybe it's time...

874
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,308
we start to express ourselves
in new ways.

875
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,550
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it?

876
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,313
- Yeah.
- l love you.

877
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,474
lt's your turn.

878
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,789
That's not
what l was thinking.

879
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,793
Sex. lt's always about sex.

880
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,838
lt's not always about sex.

881
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,832
l just thought it was
about sex this time.

882
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,232
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around...

883
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,151
and people don't mean it.

884
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,312
When l say it, l want it
to be more than words.

885
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,994
- l want it to be--
- Perfect.

886
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,871
Exactly.

887
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,674
- Okay, Albert. You ready?
- No problemo.

888
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,589
I close my eyes
at night

889
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,910
Come on, Heather.
Work with me here.

890
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,839
Goal, Ostreicher!

891
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,469
- All right, Oz!
- Atta boy, Ozzie!

892
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,391
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!

893
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,994
- We're crushing you losers!
- Let's go, fellas!

894
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,991
Come on!
Whoo-hoo!

895
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,992
Bumblebee, bumblebee
bumblebee, bumblebee, bumblebee

896
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,036
Focus on the music.
Think melody.

897
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,078
- Let the music be my guide.
- That would be a start.

898
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,238
Who's the man?
Stifler!

899
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,436
Huddle up, guys!
Huddle up!

900
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,436
Huddle up!
Come on! Okay.

901
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,351
All right, all right!

902
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,556
- Good hustle, guys.
- Good hustle.

903
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,395
But you can still lose. You all saw
what happened to Oz out there.

904
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,474
l don't want to ever see any of you
thinking you're gonna score.

905
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,597
You don't score
until you score.

906
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,069
- Until you score.
- That's right, baby!

907
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,355
lt all boils down to today.

908
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,115
For you seniors,
this marks the culmination...

909
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,078
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.

910
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,597
l want you to think about
what this means to you.

911
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,672
Do you guys wanna look back
on your days at East...

912
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,275
and know that you used
the time you had?

913
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,920
- Hell, yeah!
- You do!

914
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,957
- Good attitude, Ostreicher.
- Good luck, fellas.

915
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,389
Christ, l didn't tell ya
to leave the game.

916
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,357
l'm sorry, Coach.

917
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,273
You got someplace
more important to be, Ostreicher?

918
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,990
Oz? Fuckface?

919
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,348
- Hey, Oz!
- Ozmeister!

920
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,271
- Oh, great.
- What about the game?

921
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,318
- l'm not playing.
- You're missing the game for us?

922
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,472
No, l'm missing the game for you.

923
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,796
Does this mean l'm not
gonna get to do the duet?

924
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,313
Albert, you suck.

925
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,111
l don't think he's comin' back.

926
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,270
Close my eyes at night

927
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,839
Close my eyes

928
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,913
Wonderin' where would I be
without you in my life

929
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,470
Everything I did
was just a bore

930
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,473
Everywhere I went
seems I been there before

931
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,633
But you brighten up for me
all of my days

932
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,837
- With a love so sweet
- In so many ways

933
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,036
I just wanna stop

934
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,511
-And thank you, baby
- I just wanna stop

935
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,717
- Thank you, baby
- Thank you, baby

936
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,237
How sweet it is
to be loved by you

937
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,510
Yeah, Oz!
You fuckin' rule!

938
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,114
- Fuckin' rule!
- Yeah!

939
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,756
Maybe the words
aren't that important.

940
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,956
lt's like, l know he
really cares about me.

941
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,031
Even if he can't
say it, he does.

942
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,874
And yeah, he always talks about sex,
but that's okay, 'cause he's a guy.

943
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,428
- He's got a dick. He's a guy.
- Right.

944
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,351
Wait. ls this
translation right?

945
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,273
''Go home, bird teacher.
l've had enough.''

946
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,193
l don't know.
l got it from Kevin.

947
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,670
- So, does it hurt?
- What?

948
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,354
You know-- sex.
Does it hurt?

949
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,638
Yeah. l mean, the first time you do it,
you know, it hurts.

950
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,679
But then you, you do it again
and again and again--

951
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,877
lt just starts
to feel good. Really good.

952
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,838
Okay, so say l don't do it.

953
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,471
And then l go off to college. l might
end up doing it with some random guy...

954
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,109
- who totally turns out to be a jerk.
- This is true.

955
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,794
And l'll wish l would've
done it with Kevin.

956
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,030
So go do it with Kevin.

957
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,032
- You think?
- Yeah. You're-- You're ready.

958
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,590
You're woman. Look at you.
You're ready for sex.

959
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,829
- You're right.
- l know.

960
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,831
l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna have sex.

961
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,195
And it's gonna be right,
and it's gonna be just perfect.

962
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,430
- Perfect sex.
- Thanks,Jessica.

963
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,796
Please.

964
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,391
- l wanna have sex.
- Now?

965
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,436
Prom.

966
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,715
You must be excited about
the big night tonight.

967
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,836
Thrilled.

968
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,832
Who's the lucky girl?

969
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,751
Michele.

970
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,798
- Michele.
- Yeah.

971
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,873
- She must be very special.
- Oh, she's special, all right.

972
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,838
l'm sure she is special if you
picked her out of the whole bunch.

973
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,990
Jim, l'm just gonna say one thing
before you leave tonight.

974
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:35,633
l want you to be very,
very careful...

975
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,234
when you're putting on...

976
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,834
the corsage.

977
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,272
- Okay, Dad.
- Promise me.

978
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,032
l promise.

979
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,317
Midnight at the oasis

980
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,517
Send your camel to bed

981
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,349
Shadows painting our faces

982
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,670
Traces

983
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:27,469
Of romance in our heads

984
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,757
Heaven's holding a half-moon

985
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,353
Shining just for us

986
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,148
Let's slip off
to a sand dune

987
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,310
Real soon

988
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,198
And kick up a little dust

989
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:51,035
Come on
Cactus is our friend

990
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,272
He'll point out the way

991
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,920
You know, at band camp
we have dances like this...

992
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,116
only they're way funner.

993
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,436
Till the evenin'ends

994
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,237
All right, status check.
Where do you guys stand?

995
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,949
Finch, we know where you are,
but can't really use that as an excuse.

996
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,633
My date's a flute-toting band dork.
Does that answer your question?

997
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,396
Oz, is this vocal-jazz shit
gonna pay off or what?

998
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,119
Kevin, what's with
the attitude?

999
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,998
Attitude? Me?

1000
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,640
l think you guys should be
a little more enthusiastic.

1001
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,075
This is the night
we've been waiting for.

1002
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,151
We're in this together.
You guys can't back out.

1003
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,755
Kev, you don't need us to get laid.
Are you afraid or something?

1004
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:50,116
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

1005
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,476
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to--

1006
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,235
Have to what, Kev, huh?
l don't have to do shit.

1007
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,551
Forget it already. l am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1008
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,191
l've never even had sex, and already,
l can't stand it. l hate sex!

1009
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,113
And l'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that...

1010
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,430
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1011
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,511
l'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there...

1012
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,434
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

1013
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,509
Goddam.

1014
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,351
You know, at least l learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

1015
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,317
Hey, Finch.

1016
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,994
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1017
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:38,436
- How come you have no date?
- l like to keep my options open.

1018
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,351
l got something for you.

1019
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,555
Consider it
a consolation prize.

1020
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,358
Jessica, this is great!
Wow!

1021
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,192
Felt sorta guilty about
taking your money.

1022
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,555
You spent $200 on this?

1023
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,757
No, l spent 50 on the flask,
1 50 on the earrings.

1024
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,631
- These are--
- Let me just clarify...

1025
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,280
that you have no chance
of scoring with me, Finch.

1026
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,952
Of course not!

1027
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,508
So l take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh?

1028
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,511
You met at that party
a while back, right?

1029
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,431
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

1030
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,478
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

1031
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,393
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

1032
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,636
Deep conversation, huh?

1033
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,233
ls that what you call it?

1034
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,797
What else would l call it?

1035
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:34,191
Thank you, Great Falls.

1036
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:37,158
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.

1037
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,197
You suck!

1038
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,428
Excuse me, everyone.

1039
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,911
Sorry to interrupt. l just thought
you all should know this.

1040
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,560
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

1041
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,835
l never had sex with him.

1042
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,118
He's never had sex with anyone.
l know this because he told me.

1043
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,875
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

1044
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,157
He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

1045
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,073
Thank you for your time.

1046
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,437
- Guess what?
- Not interested.

1047
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,593
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

1048
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:34,557
- l'm not going.
- What?

1049
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,278
Why not?

1050
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,671
Look, things didn't really
turn out how l wanted them to.

1051
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,990
l mean, l don't even
know what l'm doin'.

1052
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:48,311
l'm acting like l've got
everything together tonight.

1053
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,949
l know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if l love her, and...

1054
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,871
l don't know
what l'm gonna say.

1055
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,791
l mean, l'm on the brink.

1056
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,316
l'm just about to do it.
l should be psyched.

1057
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,313
l don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe l am just scared.

1058
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,313
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1059
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,358
We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

1060
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,670
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

1061
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,718
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

1062
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,318
We were friends with Stifler?

1063
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,076
Hey, look.

1064
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,834
Sherman didn't even get laid.

1065
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:27,514
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.

1066
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,749
What?

1067
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,157
We'll tell you on the bus.

1068
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:36,277
l'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

1069
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,749
My date too, perhaps?

1070
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,430
Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.

1071
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,351
That reminds me
of this one time--

1072
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,238
Hey, can l ask you
a question?

1073
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,880
How come you don't have any stories?
l've got lots of them...

1074
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,030
and you don't have any.

1075
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,157
Oh, l've got stories.
Believe me. They're just--

1076
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,879
They're just a little more risque
than tales of band camp.

1077
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:02,351
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

1078
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,271
Okay. You want a story?

1079
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,715
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer--

1080
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,235
This is the nicest
room in the house.

1081
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,992
Kev, it's perfect.

1082
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,871
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?

1083
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,428
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

1084
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,670
Fuckers,
fuckers, fuckers!

1085
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,508
- Out.
- Come on!

1086
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,909
- Get out.
- Man!

1087
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,196
There's something l've been
meaning to tell you, Heather.

1088
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,475
What's that?

1089
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,755
lt's gonna sound
really bad, but...

1090
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,354
l want you to know.

1091
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,000
You see...

1092
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,153
l'm a virgin, and--

1093
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,800
Well, me, Kevin,Jim
and Finch were--

1094
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,474
We all made this pact...

1095
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,279
that we would
lose our virginity...

1096
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,316
before high school
was over...

1097
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,312
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

1098
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,231
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1099
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,993
No, that's not what l mean.

1100
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,152
What l mean is--

1101
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,879
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?

1102
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,794
See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...

1103
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,440
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score--

1104
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,511
This isn't any better, Chris.

1105
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,591
No, you see--
You see, Heather...

1106
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,989
what l realized is that...

1107
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:55,756
with you, it's not like
l'm running towards a goal...

1108
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,991
looking for
the best way to score.

1109
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,436
This may sound
a little corny, but...

1110
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,670
l feel like l've already won.

1111
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,312
And l care about you a lot.

1112
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,675
Oz, l know.

1113
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,991
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

1114
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,911
lt's what your friends call you.

1115
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,912
l mean, l feel like l'm
one of your friends now.

1116
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,595
And your girlfriend?

1117
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,829
Are ya lost?

1118
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,919
You're Stifler's mom.

1119
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,639
No, no, not lost.
Just, um...

1120
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,551
you know, taking the tour.

1121
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,033
Hey, thank you for letting us
have this wonderful party.

1122
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,429
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

1123
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,515
So, you enjoying yourself?

1124
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,910
l'm three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1125
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,230
l'm so happy for you.

1126
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,151
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

1127
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,197
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. lt was--

1128
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,589
lt was a bathroom incident.

1129
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,071
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.

1130
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,989
You have anything to drink?

1131
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,911
l believe the kegs are upstairs.

1132
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,594
That is what the cretins drink.

1133
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,671
l'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.

1134
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,593
- The good stuff.
- All right.

1135
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,991
l got some scotch.

1136
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,476
- Single malt?
- Aged 1 8 years.

1137
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,595
The way l like it.

1138
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,156
Why don't you go grab
a glass from the bar?

1139
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,040
l think l should.

1140
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,997
Allow me.

1141
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,391
You know it's a bitchin' party.

1142
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,869
The Stif-man always
comes through in the clutch.

1143
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,554
And then he just
puked his brains out.

1144
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,393
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, l told you.

1145
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,550
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?

1146
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,596
lt's sort of sexual.

1147
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,914
Yeah! Yeah, let's hear it.

1148
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,596
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

1149
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,150
l don't know if you know it,
but it's called ''Spin the Bottle.''

1150
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,949
And l had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1151
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,871
And he plays trombone--

1152
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:08,269
So how do you want to be?

1153
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,193
Like, how do you
want to do it?

1154
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,960
l don't know.
How do you?

1155
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,591
Like normal style.
The missionary position.

1156
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,156
Kev?

1157
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,435
- Yeah?
- l wanna hear you say it.

1158
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,750
Victoria...

1159
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,717
l love you.

1160
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,994
l love you.

1161
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,316
Oh my. Here.

1162
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,389
You okay?

1163
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,234
Yeah. Go slow.

1164
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,798
So the end of the story is you...

1165
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,871
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1166
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,748
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

1167
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,559
but l didn't care
because it was so funny.

1168
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:01,789
l get it.

1169
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,475
And this one time at band camp,
l stuck a flute in my pussy.

1170
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:09,709
Excuse me?

1171
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,394
What? You don't think l know
how to get myself off?

1172
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,756
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is-- Sex Ed.

1173
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,832
So are we gonna screw soon,
'cause l'm gettin' kinda antsy.

1174
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,676
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!

1175
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,672
Now, l have two rubbers.
Wear them both. lt'll desensitize you.

1176
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,149
l don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1177
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,515
What makes you think
that l would come early?

1178
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:50,513
Come on. l saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think l accepted this date?

1179
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,999
You're a sure thing.

1180
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,873
Yes, l am.

1181
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,478
So l said, ''This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca.''

1182
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,998
So, would you object if l said
that you were quite striking?

1183
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,713
Mr Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

1184
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,871
Yes, ma'am, l am.

1185
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,349
Mmm, you're dead.

1186
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,629
- l had no idea you'd be this good.
- Neither did l.

1187
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,278
Oh, Finchy. Finch.

1188
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,671
- Oh, Stifler's mom!
- Finchy!

1189
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,429
Okay, let's go.

1190
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,829
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!

1191
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,990
Michele, Michele.

1192
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,397
Oh, God.

1193
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,791
That was a great night, huh?

1194
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,792
l mean, l just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

1195
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,589
l know.
lt went by so fast.

1196
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,194
Yeah, it did.

1197
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,035
Next year with you
going to Ann Arbor...

1198
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,112
and me going to lthaca...

1199
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,192
it's not gonna work, is it?

1200
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,191
No. Don't say that.

1201
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,669
l mean,
we could make it work.

1202
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,474
- lt'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.

1203
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,070
But--

1204
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,199
That's what l've been realizing,
is that nothing's perfect.

1205
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,113
And you can't plan everything.

1206
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,275
Well, l guess you will
be pretty far away.

1207
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,432
And we'll be on our own,
meeting new people.

1208
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,357
Last night, though.

1209
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,194
l wasn't lying.

1210
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,951
l know.

1211
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,270
She's gone. Wha--

1212
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,316
Oh, my God.
She used me.

1213
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,277
l was used.

1214
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,391
l was used. Cool!

1215
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,511
What's this door locked--

1216
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,477
Mom, where's--

1217
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:58,993
- Mom? Shit-brick?
- Hey, Stifler.

1218
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,716
l just gotta say that women...

1219
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,268
like a fine wine,
only get better with age.

1220
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,838
Of course, l have
no basis for comparison, but...

1221
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,751
it was good.

1222
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,149
So you almost made it,
huh, Oz?

1223
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,117
l'll just say that we had
a great night together.

1224
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,192
Hang in there, buddy.
You'll get there.

1225
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,590
You know, guys, l think
we're falling in love.

1226
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:33,834
That's great, man.
That's awesome.

1227
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,719
You know what
the coolest thing is, guys?

1228
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,791
This. You know, right now.

1229
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,475
lt's true. l mean, after this,
everything's gonna be different.

1230
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,596
After getting laid?

1231
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,513
- After high school.
- Here's to the next step.

1232
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,669
To the next step.

1233
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,035
- To the next step.
- To the next step.

1234
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,790
Sweetheart?
