00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,490
Ms. Crane, your uncle was--

549
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,350
What about my uncle?

550
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,760
He was a very kind
 and charming man

551
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,160
in a world that is sorely
 lacking in such qualities.

552
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,190
He was one of my
 closest friends.

553
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,370
One of my deepest regrets
 is not believing him.

554
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,680
I have my other
 duties to attend.

555
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,290
I bid you good bye.

556
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,220
Inspector.

557
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,070
Thank you.

558
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,060
I'm-- I'm sure my
 uncle understood.

559
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,220
He was a very smart
 man, my uncle.

560
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,280
Indeed he was.

561
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,250
Good bye.

562
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,380
CARL: Hey, [NON-ENGLISH].

563
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,510
My name's Eleanor.

564
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,890
OK, Eleanor, she
 wants to see you.

565
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,510
You kill him with
 a silver bullet.

566
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,700
You did good.

567
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,820
But I didn't want to.

568
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,640
He forced me to.

569
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,410
He wanted to die.

570
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:16,730
Yes.

571
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,680
I understand.

572
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,530
I understand.

573
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,860
CARL: Good luck, Eleanor.
 - Good luck.

574
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,020
Thank you.

575
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,730
You're welcome.
