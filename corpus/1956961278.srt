40,000 years ago at the
end of the last ice age,

19
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:50,263
temperatures climbed and climbed
in the Los Angeles basin,

20
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,568
giving rise to new species
of plants and animals.

21
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:56,971
New predators attacked new prey.

22
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,141
But something else rose
as the heat swelled.

23
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:05,179

28
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,264
Thousands of years later,

29
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,068
early Native Americans
settled in the area.

30
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,805
Villagers nearby used the
tar as sealant for canoes,

31
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,540
baskets and huts.

32
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:36,210
On one occasion, the villagers
were having a celebration,

33
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,745
but in the morning,

34
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:42,183
three of the tribesmen who had
ventured off were found dead,

35
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:46,220
covered and suffocated
by the black substance.

36
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:49,090
After this incident,
no one was permitted

37
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,692

buried the tar pit deep
below its concrete surfaces.

42
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,711
Only a small open pit
remained, allowing excavators

43
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,681
to sift through the trove
of ancient skeletons.

44
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,751
Many new species were
discovered, but one,

45
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,453

was never found.
