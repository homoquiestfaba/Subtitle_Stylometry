1
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,808
I wait for Christmas
All year long

2
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:23,481
How I wish
that I could only change it

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,444
Take the calendar
and rearrange it

4
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:32,198
Then every day
Would be so nice

5
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,287
Candy canes
And all the snow...

6
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,496
[mutters to self]
Keep an open mind.

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,165
Don't look for a reason
to run.

8
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,709
[chuckles weakly]

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,711
Sam?

10
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,338
Dr. Vance DeBlaine.

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,256
So sorry I'm late.
Surgery ran long.

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,632
All good.

13
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,508
Nice to finally meet you.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,427
Same.

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,347
I know we said drinks,
but should we grab a table?

16
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,641
Most people
think a tonsillectomy

17
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,768
is just for when you're young,

18
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,478
but a lot of adults
have 'em, too.

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,520
Is that so?

20
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,481
It is.

21
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:08,026
So, Sam, your profile said
you're a business manager?

22
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,444
Vague, I know.

23
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,821
Uh, basically I help
high-net worth clients

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,531
manage their money
and assets

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,242
and guide them to, hopefully,
make prudent decisions.

26
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,203
Right now, I'm trying
to convince one client

27
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,663
not to buy
a social media company.

28
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,332
[kids giggling loudly]

29
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,626
Kids are so cute
at that age.

30
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,919
Hmm?

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,254
Ah. Don't mind me,
I'm kid-crazy right now.

32
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,257
My brother and his wife
just had twins back in August.

33
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,258
My first time
being an uncle.

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,635
Aww!

35
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,636
Wanna see pictures of them?

36
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,388
Oh, no, that's okay. I--

37
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,140
Oh, yes, there they are--
there are two of 'em.

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,558
Leah and Chloe.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,643
They live in Portland.

40
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,186
I can't wait to see them
for Christmas.

41
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,563
Makes me want to have twins
when I get married.

42
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,648
[whispers] Check?

43
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,108
[mouths words]

44
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,025
Do you have any nieces
or nephews?

45
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,443
Hmm?

46
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,945
Uh, yes.

47
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,280
One of each.
Miles and Dania.

48
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,866
They live with my sister
and brother-in-law in Brayden.

49
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,786
That's not too far away.
You must see them all the time.

50
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,789
Not really. Being self-employed
means working 24/7.

51
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,792
[chuckles] You know, plus,
I find the suburbs confusing

52
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,544
with all the peace and quiet

53
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,338
and lawn gnomes in front
of the identical houses.

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,297
It's...

55
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,507
Will you see them
for Christmas?

56
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,466
No! Heh-heh!

57
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,301
I will be
on a plane to Hawaii

58
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:19,014
in T-minus 22 hours
and four minutes.

59
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,141
It's my first attempt
at relaxation

60
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,976
in longer than I care to admit,
because...

61
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,644
well, it'll just depress me.

62
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,604
Wait. You're going to Hawaii
for Christmas?

63
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,564
That's right.

64
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,481
Without your family?

65
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,232
Yes.

66
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,277
[***]

67
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,534
[***]

68
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,206
[giggling and laughing]

69
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,259
Mm. I'm sorry, Murph.

70
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,385
No time for fetch.

71
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,679
-[phone rings]
-Off to work I go.

72
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,056
[rings]

73
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,140
Hey, Mom.

74
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,641
Hello, my baby boy.

75
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,685
Would you like to come over
for lunch?

76
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,020
I made extra lasagna.

77
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,897
And Arabella is here

78
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,981
while your brother's
at the store.

79
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,483
I wish I could,

80
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,234
but I'm off to work
on Kathleen and Nate's nursery.

81
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,944
You know, their baby's due
New Year's.

82
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,613
That's right!

83
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,865
Hey, did they give you
any tips on adopting?

84
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,116
Yeah, they did,

85
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,494
and, uh, I'm looking
over some documents.

86
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,788
Oh, and I have an appointment
with their lawyer in January.

87
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,122
[gasps] This is so exciting!

88
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,458
Maybe, by next Christmas,
I'll be a grandma again.

89
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,502
Hey, whoa-ho, whoa.
Tap the breaks.

90
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,965
I can practically
see you knitting booties now.

91
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,218
Look, this is gonna
take some time,

92
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,136
and a surprisingly hefty
retainer fee

93
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,388
for me
to get things in place.

94
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,722
Well, don't wait too long.

95
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,724
Your brothers and sisters
have a head start on you.

96
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm starting to lose count
of how many grandkids I have.

97
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,728
-Grandma!
-[chuckling]

98
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,063
That's very funny.

99
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,022
I'll call you later.

100
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,732
Bye-bye, honey.

101
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,069
Good morning.

102
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,446
Morning!

103
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,572
[splat]

104
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,658
[kids chuckling]

105
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,412
You are in such trouble!

106
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,081
-Now?
-Now!

107
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:08,915
But that's--

108
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,208
...Two weeks early.

109
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,751
I thought we were having
a New Year's baby.

110
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,752
Christmas.

111
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,920
We're not ready!

112
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,088
Tell that to the baby.

113
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,881
Oh, I'm bringing it up
when she's 18.

114
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,008
We need to focus!

115
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,384
And pack!

116
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,344
-Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

117
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,973
[***]

118
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,225
Lydia said the birth mother

119
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,977
just started having
real contractions.

120
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,103
Okay, so we may have
a bit of time.

121
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,438
I think so.

122
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,981
The drive from here to Buffalo
is nine hours.

123
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,859
Yeah, and that huge snowstorm's
a couple days away.

124
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,444
That's not our biggest problem
right now.

125
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,862
What's
our biggest problem right now?

126
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,697
Who's gonna watch Miles
and Dania while we're gone?

127
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,199
Right, yeah, the kids.
Uh, what about your mom?

128
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,784
She's still
at her art retreat in Italy.

129
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,245
She's not supposed to fly in
until the day after Christmas.

130
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,621
Yeah, my parents are still
on vacation in Sydney.

131
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,581
Where's Frank?

132
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,041
Dad's at
his fishing cabin with--

133
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,959
[both] ...No service.

134
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,961
What about
Miles watching Dania?

135
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,713
I mean, he's 13 now.

136
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,631
Right, yeah. Terrible idea.
Forget I suggested it.

137
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,175
[sighing heavily]
Whoever it is

138
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,469
has to be trustworthy
and responsible.

139
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,137
And have nothing else
going on...

140
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,513
four days before Christmas.

141
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,806
[ding]

142
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,725
-This Christmas
-[both exhaling deeply]

143
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,644
I'll dream
of a private yacht

144
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,856
I'm not saying that you can't
buy the yacht, Stavros.

145
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,318
I'm asking if it's truly
the best use of your bonus,

146
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,737
considering
you already have one.

147
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,781
[***]

148
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,824
Yes, you did.

149
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,910
Last year.

150
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,620
There you go! Exactly!

151
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,789
Okay, so, there are
many things we can do.

152
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
We can take the--

153
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,166
[sighs]

154
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,503
Tigers... are illegal.

155
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,006
Uh, Stavros...

156
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,509
I'm gonna have to call you back
on my way to Hawaii, okay?

157
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,302
Just--
Just don't buy anything!

158
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,680
What?
Shut the front door!

159
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,681
Mm-hmm!

160
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,182
That's why
she was acting weird!

161
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,517
Yeah, it turns out
she was planning

162
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,852
the world's
most romantic proposal.

163
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,813
Did she dress up in a suit
of armor and ride a horse

164
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,439
with a jousting pole
and the ring on it?

165
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,982
Did one of
your clients do that?

166
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,359
Uh, Omar.

167
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,944
Don't ask me how I found
the jousting pole. Whoa!

168
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,570
Never.
And, no, she didn't.

169
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,782
It was roses, "I love you,"
and this ring.

170
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,201
It's perfect.

171
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,036
This deserves a toast.

172
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,538
Oh, my god.

173
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,415
I knew you'd have
two champagne flutes handy.

174
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,292
In my line of work,

175
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,211
you always have
to be ready to celebrate

176
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,213
in case a big deal goes through.

177
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,506
And this...

178
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,259
pretty much qualifies
as a big deal.

179
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,218
-[pop]
-Boom!

180
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,387
[both laugh]

181
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,555
It's exciting!

182
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,056
Okay, but really,
can you believe it?

183
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,141
Like, I'm engaged?

184
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,559
Honestly, Ellie?

185
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,185
I can't.

186
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,770
Didn't we always say

187
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,731
that marriage
is for other people?

188
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,607
Yeah.

189
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,984
Well...

190
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,737
I don't know, things change
when you meet "the one".

191
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,239
I heard it--
it's cliche, but it's true.

192
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,365
I'll take your word for it.

193
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,575
Hey, you know what?

194
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,410
It could happen
for you, too, though.

195
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,287
Oh... wait.

196
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,913
It can't,

197
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,915
'cause that means that you'd
have to make it to a second date

198
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,418
and like, you know--
oh, that thing you do,

199
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,502
where you look
for a reason to run--

200
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,795
yeah, you can't do that.

201
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,172
Then what?

202
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,799
Move to the suburbs
and settle down, like my sister?

203
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,384
Or me and Abbie. We're talking
about moving there.

204
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,137
We could be neighbors again!

205
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,263
[scoffs] Please.

206
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,515
Can you imagine me...

207
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,770
in the suburbs with a husband,
a dog, and an SUV?

208
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,771
Why not?

209
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,105
Sam...

210
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,315
more than anything,

211
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,317
I just... you know,
I hope one day

212
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,444
you find a guy
that makes you want

213
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,321
to break open
a bottle of champagne

214
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,615
and, you know,
have it just be for you.

215
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,950
[clink]

216
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,951
Congrats.

217
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:32,994
Thank you.

218
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,121
[***]

219
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,498
[laughing]

220
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,458
Uncle Jason?

221
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,085
-Oh, hey, Arabella.
-Grandma

222
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,961
told me to bring this to you,
in case you get hungry.

223
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,296
Oh, thanks.

224
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,339
Lasagna.

225
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,965
Of course.

226
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,760
Hi, Arabella.

227
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,513
Hey, Miles. Are you gonna be
at the play tryouts tomorrow?

228
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,182
Yeah, sure. Totally.

229
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,142
-Yeah.
-Cool.

230
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,644
See you there.
Bye, Uncle Jason.

231
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,812
-Bye, Arabella.
-Bye.

232
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,647
Bye.

233
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,483
So, the community center's

234
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,610
doing The Life and Times
of Santa Clausthis year.

235
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,903
Arabella's the Elf Queen.

236
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,655
And the kid who's supposed
to be the narrator

237
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,864
has to go out of town,

238
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,408
so they're looking for
a replacement, ASAP.

239
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,159
-Got it.
-I can

240
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,036
text your parents the info,
if you really want to audition?

241
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,080
[blurts nervously]
Yeah, I do. Thanks.

242
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,665
[smooching]

243
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,291
[laughs] Look at you.

244
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
I'm gonna get you!

245
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,794
Okay, you two.

246
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,588
Anything?

247
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,756
Aunt Martha's in Oklahoma.

248
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,925
[sighs]
Uh, what about the Huttons?

249
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,218
Hedy said that they're going
to Pat's family's

250
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,344
in Michigan tomorrow.

251
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,138
Yeah, we're just
so close to Christmas.

252
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,222
[voices carrying]

253
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,182
What about Jason?

254
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,684
He's babysat the kids before

255
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,394
and he's thinking
about adopting--

256
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,812
this could be a trial run.

257
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,855
Well, you know, we just
hired him as the contractor

258
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,189
for the nursery.

259
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,066
It feels like a lot to ask
more than an evening,

260
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,026
you know, like we're--

261
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,361
Yeah, taking advantage.

262
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,030
[both cringing] Yeah.

263
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,157
[inhales sharply]

264
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,868
We could ask your brother.

265
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,369
Are you kidding?

266
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,079
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

267
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,332
-[flames whooshing]
-[alarm blaring]

268
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,709
[blasting]

269
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,421
[wheezing and choking]

270
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,923
[hacking and coughing]

271
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,676
[coughs and sputters]

272
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,262
I'll totally pay for that.

273
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,389
[coughs]

274
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,016
[smoke alarm blares]

275
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:18,975
[whoosh]

276
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,435
He did pay for it.

277
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,936
That's not the point!

278
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,938
Sam doesn't know
the first thing about kids.

279
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,690
Plus, he'd probably say
"no" anyhow.

280
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,442
He hasn't visited us since...

281
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,195
[***]

282
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,446
Hey, um...

283
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,906
Sam's family.

284
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,074
He's only
a couple of hours away.

285
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,283
And, hon?

286
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,077
He's kind of our only option.

287
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,580
[tropical music plays]

288
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,333
[Jason hums and scats
to the tune]

289
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,053
[phone begins ringing]

290
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,346
Bah, buh-buh

291
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,015
[ringing]

292
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,266
Is everything okay?

293
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,143
Why do you say it like that?

294
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,603
[exhales deeply] Because...

295
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,313
we haven't talked since...

296
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,899
[words catch]

297
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,110
Did Mom tell you that
Nate and I are adopting again?

298
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,612
Yeah, she mentioned something
about that a few months ago.

299
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,905
How's that going,
by the way?

300
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,199
The birth mother
just went into labor.

301
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,617
Ah! So goin' soon, then?

302
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,077
Sooner than expected.

303
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,287
She wasn't supposed to arrive
until New Year's.

304
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,831
[phone alert chimes]

305
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,000
And Mom was gonna help--
-Uh-huh.

306
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,751
...But she's not set
to arrive until the 26th,

307
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,961
to watch Miles and Dania,

308
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,337
and we have to drive out
to Buffalo

309
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,463
to get the baby today.

310
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,840
It'll cost her a kidney

311
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,508
to rebook
this close to Christmas.

312
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,926
That's what she said.

313
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,927
Anyway...

314
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,804
we need to find someone
A.S.A.P.

315
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,472
to come here
and be with the kids

316
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,473
until we get back.

317
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,266
[record scratches]

318
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,475
Wait...

319
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,979
are you asking me
to babysit?

320
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,689
I know it's been
a really long time

321
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,357
since you've been
drafted into service--

322
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,358
Years!

323
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,484
It's been years, Kath.

324
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,194
We're obviously desperate,

325
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,612
but you are the only person

326
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,657
who never goes anywhere
for the holidays.

327
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,993
And you can make
all of your work calls here...

328
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,038
when you're not with
the kids, of course.

329
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,123
[grunts in frustration]
Ah...

330
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,875
[Dania] Mom!

331
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,127
You're gonna make me
do it, aren't you?

332
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,503
Fine.

333
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,172
I'm calling in
the Calvin Card.

334
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,381
[horrified] What?

335
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,675
It has been 22 years!

336
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,927
You made me lie to Mom and Dad

337
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,804
about where you were
on Senior Night in high school

338
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,306
when you snuck out
with Calvin Carnackie

339
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,474
to Central Park,

340
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,600
and I told them
that you were

341
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,018
with Sonya Perez
and Lola Kurtz,

342
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,770
so that you wouldn't
get grounded

343
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,979
for the whole entire summer.

344
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,231
You totally owe me--
big-time!

345
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh! I can't believe
you're calling that in!

346
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,527
[exhales victoriously]

347
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,196
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

348
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,238
Isn't there, like, a--

349
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,865
a professional
Mary Poppins service

350
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,283
out there you could hire?

351
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,410
Someone who has
the slightest clue

352
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,828
on what to do
with children?

353
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,664
And who didn't blow up the house
last time they tried?

354
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,124
You know what?

355
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,418
[huffs] I knew better
than to ask,

356
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,087
but Nate pulled
his "Sam's family"

357
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,339
Jedi mind-tricks,
and I fell for it.

358
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,091
I guess I'm just gonna have
to leave Miles in charge

359
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,217
after all.

360
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,260
Merry Christmas, Sam.

00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,263

364
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,563
Miles being in charge
was sarcasm, right?

365
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,273
He's 13.
Of course, it was sarcasm.

366
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,566
Just checking.

367
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,402
[inhales] How long
would this...

368
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,153
arrangement entail?

369
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,697
Two days. Probably.

370
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,739
"Probably"?

371
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,949
You know, Sam...

372
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,200
babies have
their own schedules.

373
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,493
But you won't.

374
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,911
I will leave you a detailed one
and make sure

375
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,163
that you don't have
to worry about a thing.

376
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,250
[screams] Ahhhhh!

377
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,167
[inhales]

378
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,377
[forced cheer] Okay.

379
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,795
Seriously? Okay!

380
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,588
Wow! Thank you!

381
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,548
But I don't have to cook?

382
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,674
Absolutely not.

383
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,925
[relieved sigh]

384
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,843

[***]

386
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,934
Best behavior
from both of you, okay?

387
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,603
Jason's gonna watch over you
until Uncle Sam gets here.

388
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,771
I don't need
a babysitter anymore.

389
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,815
Well, your sister does.

390
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,316
Unless you wanna do all
the cooking and cleaning

391
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,151
for her
while I'm gone?

392
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,819
[kids] No!

393
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,779
I'll stay
until your brother gets here.

394
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,156
And I'll finish up the nursery
before you get back.

395
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,199
[sighing] You're amazing.
Thank you so much.

396
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,993
Okay, car's packed.

397
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,955
Christmas is in four days.
You'll be back in time, right?

398
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,291
Of course, sweetie!

399
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,584
Promise?

400
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:15,086
I promise.

401
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,505
We'll absolutely be back
in time for Christmas.

402
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,094
And we'll bring
your new baby sister, too.

403
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,513
Later, buddy.

404
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,640
-Oh!

405
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,059
Bye.

406
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,770
I'm sorry--
you gave up Hawaii...

407
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,854
to babysit?

408
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:33,980
Didn't give up.

409
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,316
I merely delayed
my departure.

410
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,151
But my baby sister hasn't
asked me to watch the kids

411
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,361
since...

412
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,653
Since you almost burned down
their kitchen,

413
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,072
making an omelette?

414
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,866
It was a minor fire,
quickly extinguished.

415
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,618
Plus, my plan is just
to order in everything.

416
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,827
That's expensive.

417
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,662
Cheaper than a remodel.

418
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,956
Sam, you have
an aversion to kids.

419
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,166
No, no, not an aversion.

420
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,710
I'm awkward
and uncomfortable.

421
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,337
Mainly when they're tiny.

422
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,963
But Miles is like 13,

423
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,465
he's practically
in college now and--

424
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,133
-What?
-...Dania is...

425
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,431
...well, she's somewhere
between like six and... ten,

426
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,433
so, we're going to be able
to communicate like adults.

427
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,102
It's gonna be a disaster.

428
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,312
Oh! Ye of little faith.

429
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,898
I am going to rock
these two nights of gunclehood

430
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,775
and then it's off
to checking work emails

431
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,111
on sandy beaches,
sipping Mai Tais.

432
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:23,822
I got this.

433
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,074
You got this.

434
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,952
Yeah...

435
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,704
I got this! Sorry.

-Yeah!
-Oh!

443
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,846
Let's go!

444
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,140
That's it--
time for you to hit the hay.

445
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,559
Oh, come on.
This is just 'cause you lost.

446
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,852
And because
it's 15 minutes past

447
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,271
when your mom said
she wanted you to be in bed.

448
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,939
But, in deference
to your victory...

449
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,900
...I'll clean up.

450
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,527

Whoa...

I'm...

Your family's neighbor.

00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,652
Oh!

473
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,404
Hi!

474
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,947
Sam. Dalton.

475
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,699
The brother.

476
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,742
Which you obviously
already know.

477
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:33,952
Obviously.

478
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,538
I've said "obviously" twice.

479
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,039
[chuckling awkwardly]

480
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,291
Uh... this way.

481
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,588
Right!
All these houses out here,

482
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,341
they just... they look--
they look the same to me.

483
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,343
So, when was the last time
you were in Brayden?

484
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,803
A while.

485
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,847
Kathleen and Nate usually
come to visit me

486
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,015
in the big city,

487
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,183
when they need
some grown-up time.

488
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,562
You're new.

489
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,355
Yes and no.

490
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,773
Well, you guys

491
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,693
sure do like to go all out
for Christmas around here.

492
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,028
Well, you should see

493
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,779
my mom and pop's place
across the street.

494
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,031
Oh, your parents
are across the street?

495
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,615
Yeah, for a few years.

496
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,617
Then my place opened up around
the time my great-aunt Mimi--

497
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,745
God rest her soul--
[smooch]

498
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,829
...left me enough
for a downpayment.

499
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,830
Here I am.

500
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,916
[chuckles awkwardly]
Here you are.

501
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,752
Enough about me.

502
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,716
Wow.

503
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,676
Kathleen left this for you.

504
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,635
Ah, yes!

505
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,304
The schedule!

506
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,431
Wow.

507
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,058
This is the longest document
I've seen

508
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,434
that wasn't
a mortgage application.

509
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,603
She has got this
down to the minute!

510
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,729
7 A.M.-- "Wake up".

511
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,064
Oof!

512
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,857
7:10-- "Make sure
children are awake."

513
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,526
Oh, she's serious.

514
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,320
7:15--
"Begin ordering breakfast.

515
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,239
Menus are in the... kitchen."

516
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,700
I'm feeling very "Maria
Von Trapp meets the Captain"

517
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,160
at the moment.

518
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,411
[***]

519
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,996
Oh, she doesn't
have the play on here.

520
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,956
-Play?
-Yeah, there's an audition

521
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,458
for the Christmas play,
tomorrow at 10 A.M.

522
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,919
I was in Christmas plays
when I was a kid.

523
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,838
I once played
an elf named Gunther.

524
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,759
Pretty sure that's the origin
of my lederhosenaversion.

525
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,473
Ahem. You were saying?

526
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,141
Yeah, Miles really
wants to audition.

527
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,726
He kinda has
a crush on my niece,

528
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,727
but we don't discuss it.

529
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,145
Wise. Ha.

530
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,272
Well, what does
she have down for 10?

531
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,442
Uh, "Christmas Crafts.
Make stocking for baby."

532
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,568
Okay.

533
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,446
Well, I'm already taking
my niece Arabella

534
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,490
to the auditions--
I can take Miles, too,

535
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,409
and then you're free to make
the stocking with Dania.

536
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,284
Yeah, okay.

537
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,078
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

538
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,079
And that way, you'll be
back on schedule by noon,

539
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,499
for, um... "lunch".

540
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,584
[laughs silently]

541
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,545
That's great.

542
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,005
Cool. Okay.

543
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,215
Yeah.

544
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,092
[***]

545
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,512
Where are the kids, anyway?

546
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,347
They're asleep.

547
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,557
So early?

548
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,808
It's past 10:30 P.M.

549
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,019
Which is late...

550
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,146
for children.

551
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,564
And for me, too,
so, if you're okay here,

552
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,524
I'm gonna head home.

553
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,317
-[huffs anxiously]
-[phone chimes]

554
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,153
Uh...

555
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,113
I airdropped my contact info
to your phone,

556
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,282
so, if you need any help,
I'm just right next door.

557
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,783
Bless you.
[relieved chuckle]

558
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,829
You're doing a good thing,
Sam...

559
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,706
the brother.

560
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,833
Thank you, Jason...

561
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,543
the neighbor.

562
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,879
Night.

563
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,633
[to self] Don't look
for a reason to run.

564
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,427
You so got this!

565
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,263
Mm-hmm.

566
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,723
-[clattering and crashing]
-Oh...

567
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,683
ooh.

568
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,728
[***]

569
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,320
[***]

570
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,576
[gasps]

571
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,537
Who are you?

572
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,748
Uh... Sam.

573
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,833
Your uncle?

574
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,127
My uncle Sam has a mustache.

575
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:14,005
Th-That was
an unfortunate phase

576
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,591
that was blessedly brief.

577
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,805
Uncle Sam!

578
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,723
Oh! Oh... hi!

579
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,726
I texted Mom.

580
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,770
She said I could have
pancakes for breakfast!

581
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,188
Oh...

582
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,690
[exhales]

583
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,818
Oh!

584
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,570
[***]

585
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,325
Oh! [chuckles] You're up!

586
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,452
[grumpy] You're late.

587
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:48,123
"Somebody" hasn't
had their morning coffee.

588
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,709
I'm 13.
I don't drink coffee.

589
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,918
Good call!

590
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,212
Guess that leaves you out,
too, then, huh?

591
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,506
Good call.

592
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,300
So, where is
the, uh, machine?

593
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,927
With the... you know?

594
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,262
Pods.

595
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,513
We don't use pods

596
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,306
because plastic stays around
in landfills

597
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,726
for a million-billion years.

598
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,935
Okay, fair.

599
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,478
But what do the adults
of the household--

600
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,188
A.K.A. "Mom and Dad" to you--

601
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,440
drink for caffeine?

602
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,442
Dad drinks kombucha
and Mom drinks tea.

603
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,027
This is a coffee-free home?

604
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,031
I really feel like that
should've been conveyed earlier.

605
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:23,158
Want me to get you a kombucha?

606
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,492
Not if my life
depended on it.

607
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,744
I'll make do with tea.

608
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,037
Now! Breakfast!

609
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,663
You're not gonna cook,
are you?

610
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,081
Eh! No. Heh.

611
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,375
Luckily, your mother's
unnervingly thorough schedule

612
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,960
on what the next two days
looks like,

613
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,712
includes delivery places,

614
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:39,132
which means breakfast pancakes
are gonna be provided by...

615
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,134
Oh! "Clean Green Food".

616
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,720
Oof, I'm gonna lose
so much weight.

617
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,221
[phone dials]

618
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,098
[out-of-service tone plays]

619
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,391
[recording]
We're sorry.

620
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,810
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

621
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:53,188
Please check the area code
and number, then dial--

622
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,481
I'm hungry!

623
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,815
Yep, any second now...

624
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,984
any second.

625
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,277
[out-of-service tone plays]

626
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,071
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed--

627
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,530
Uh... okay.

628
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,075
So, apparently,
this "Clean Green"

629
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,743
is having
some technical issues.

630
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,620
Do you know any other
restaurants we could order from?

631
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,038
They're the only
vegan place nearby

632
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,748
that'll deliver breakfast.

633
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,791
"Vegan"?

634
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,792
Dania's vegan now.

635
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,961
Willingly?

636
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,755
[whimpers] Oh, okay.

637
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,215
Um...

638
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,509
does cereal count?
Huh? How about that?

639
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,844
[whines]
Mom said pancakes!

640
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,099
Does she do this a lot?

641
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,435
I will give you 50 bucks
to not make that face anymore.

642
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,730
[cries out]
I just want pancakes!

643
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,484
We really gotta work on
your negotiating skills, kid.

644
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,988
Kid?

645
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,993
[Dania moans wailfully]

646
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,332
Hello.

647
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,750
Hey, sweetie.

648
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,419
There's eggnog on the table.
Now go inside.

649
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,504
I'll be in there
in a second, okay?

650
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,340
[chuckles]

651
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,550
-Hey, Ma.
-Mm.

652
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,634
-How are you?
-I'm good.

653
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,802
Okay.

654
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,345
Hey.

655
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,347
Thanks for taking Bella
to this play thing.

656
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,933
It's just right in the middle of
the store's Christmas rush.

657
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,101
Yeah. Of course.

658
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,146
How are you doing?

659
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,691
I'm hangin' in.

660
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,819
It's the first Christmas
as a single dad, so, uh...

661
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,488
Arabella knows
you're doing your best.

662
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,199
Thanks, Ma. I hope so.

663
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,784
Parenting isn't easy.

664
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,953
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
You're preaching to the choir.

665
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:32,996
[laughs]

666
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,081
You sure you wanna
tackle this solo?

667
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,542
I'm tired of waiting
for someone to want to join me.

668
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,753
Which could be never
at this rate, so...

669
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,588
Well, not with that attitude.

670
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,007
Jason, you spent too long
in Los Angeles,

671
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,633
looking for the right guy--
you've only been in town a year.

672
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,136
You never know
who you'll meet.

673
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,263
[phone chimes]

674
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,184
[***]

675
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,226
[door opens]

676
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,270
[whining sadly]

677
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:00,065
[***]

678
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,817
[quietly] I'm sorry!
I didn't know who else to call.

679
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,695
Apparently, it's vegan pancakes
or deep sighs of disappointment,

680
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,489
followed by a face
I usually only see

681
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,074
right before
someone breaks up with me.

682
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,410
[sighs despondently]

683
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,995
So do you want me to find
the recipe for you?

684
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,705
It's a little more
complicated than that,

685
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,540
in the fact that I don't, uh...

686
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,417
you know-- cook.

687
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,960
Ever.

688
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,295
Oh, right. The fire.

689
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,755
They told you?

690
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,548
Only because I did
some minor renovations for them

691
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,008
last summer,
and I found some scorch marks

692
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,468
that the other contractor
missed.

693
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,221
Who knew dried chives
were that flammable, huh?

694
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,806
It was like a tinderbox!
Just...

695
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:33,932
[whooshes]

696
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,850
But we're gonna focus
on the now.

697
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,728
Right. Now, I will pay
you a hundred dollars

698
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,897
to make me
a vegan pancake breakfast.

699
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,608
[***]

700
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,238
Do you want to give it a try?

701
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,823
Or make sure
the griddle's hot?

702
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,741
Thank you.

703
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:52,826
Okay.

704
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,120
And we just need
a little bit more flour.

705
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,330
And the flour... flour.
This is flour?

706
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,916
Just... scoop.

707
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,126
[coughs]

708
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,965
-And now the oat milk.
-Mm-hmm.

709
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,051
Ooh! All right.

710
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,261
There we go.

711
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,637
Now all we have to do

712
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,139
is make them...

713
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,473
Christmas pancakes.

714
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,642
Wow! Nice trick.

715
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,769
Do you have kids?

716
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,895
Not yet.

717
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,356
But I do have
18 nieces and nephews.

718
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,108
I'm sorry, what?

719
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,735
Jason has a big family.

720
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:29,070
I'm the youngest
of seven kids.

721
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,488
W-- Wow.

722
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,198
And one thing I learned
along the way

723
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,409
is how to create things

724
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,161
like...
Christmas pancakes.

725
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,373
Actual Christmas pancakes!

726
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,584
Who knew?

727
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,169
[bell dings]

728
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,048
Wow!

729
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,091
Oh! We have to leave
for the auditions in 15 minutes.

730
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,009
I'll be ready.

731
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,720
Jason?

732
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,181
Can I talk to you
for a second?

733
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,395
[exhales]

734
00:26:02,437 --> 00:26:04,147
So, you're really good
at this "uncle" thing.

735
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,482
I suppose.

736
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:06,858
I don't know what I'm doing,

737
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,318
even with the world's
most comprehensive

738
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,819
set of instructions.

739
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,654
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you just got started.

740
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,865
Yet, I've already failed
three times.

741
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,494
You know what?

742
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,120
I want to hire you.

743
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,747
What?

744
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,501
To co-nanny or...
manny or uncle...

745
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,169
whatever--
I just need someone

746
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,338
to help me
until I get the hang of things.

747
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,131
-You don't have to hire me.
-I wouldn't feel right

748
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,342
asking you for help
every two seconds.

749
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:33,843
I wouldn't know
what to charge,

750
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,261
and besides, I'm already here
working on the nursery--

751
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,013
Perfect!
You're already here!

752
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,307
And I've seen the room,
it's practically done.

753
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,725
Good job, you!

754
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,602
-I-I don't know...
-I mean, you said it yourself,

755
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,396
you have, what--
800 nieces and nephews?

756
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,397
18.

757
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,690
Potato/po-tah-to!

758
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:49,192
You're an expert!
I'm stuck in beginner mode.

759
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,694
Think of yourself as...

760
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,779
an "uncle consultant".

761
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,489
-An uncle--
-For two days.

762
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,200
Name your price.

763
00:26:57,242 --> 00:26:59,285
Do you always throw money
at a problem?

764
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,120
Only when I think it'll work.

765
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,123
Well, I do need
to hire a lawyer.

766
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,666
Okay, really not that serious.
I was thinking--

767
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,835
Yeah, for something else,
and, um, the retainer fee

768
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,169
is three times
what I budgeted for.

769
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,546
What's the fee?

770
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,424
[***]

771
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,551
Done!

772
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,011
[***]

773
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,513
Well, looks like you got
yourself an uncle consultant.

774
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,265
Yes, I do.

775
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,184
Oh, and, uh... here.

776
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:26,146
You got some green batter
on your Rossini loafers.

777
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,275
Oh! Thanks.

778
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,444
Hey, Jason?

779
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,529
How'd you know
these were Rossini loafers?

780
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,411
[quietly] Oh?

781
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,413
[realizing] Oh!

782
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,919
No...

783
00:27:57,761 --> 00:28:01,389
[***]

784
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,855
Look at
all the big Nutcrackers!

785
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,941
Whoa! Look at all
the big Nutcrackers!

786
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,028
Ah, I take it you didn't go
to a lot of these growing up?

787
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,406
Does the Museum of Modern Art
count?

788
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,033
There's a slight difference.

789
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:24,162
Well, I gotta go paint sets
until the auditions are over.

790
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,039
Oh.

791
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,582
Okay.

792
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,709
Uh, yeah. Go.
Go, go, go.

793
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,920
Text me when you're done.

794
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,594
Hey, Logan. Kevin.

795
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,388
-Hey.
-How are you?

796
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,764
Nice to see you.

797
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,391
[exchange continues
indistinctly]

798
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,850
[Sam] Interesting.

799
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:48,395
[***]

800
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,604
Uncle Sam?

801
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,272
Hey...

802
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,191
Niece Dania.

803
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,444
The Christmas stocking
craft booth is this way.

804
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,740
There's the reindeer toss!

805
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,951
May we do that, please?

806
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,077
Don't you want
to make a stocking

807
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,120
for your new baby sister?

808
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,996
Maybe later. Let's go!

809
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,165
[***]

810
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,459
Hey, Uncle Eddie.

811
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,378
Hey, kiddo!

812
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,213
Your cousins are getting
fitted for their costumes,

813
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,924
and after that, Ms. Latsko
wants to see you for Elf Queen.

814
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:19,300
Where's the fitting area?

815
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:21,761
I'll show you.
I just got done.

816
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,346
[Arabella]
Good luck, Miles.

817
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,475
Hey! Thanks so much for
coming to try out, Miles.

818
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,436
We were left in a lurch,
so this is real helpful.

819
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,646
And, uh...

820
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,773
Pete asked me to drop Arabella

821
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,275
back by his house
when it's over.

822
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,193
I'll tell Mom.

823
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,987
-Have fun.
-Let's go!

824
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:42,449
Come on.

825
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,366
[thump]

826
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,246
Oh? Yeah!

827
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,583
You are a reindeer
ring-toss ringer.

828
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,917
What does a "ringer" mean?

829
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,503
It means you get
another stuffed reindeer.

830
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,005
Your turn, Uncle Sam.

831
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,131
Oh, no, this isn't for me.

832
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,050
You don't know
until you try.

833
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,926
Some things you just know.

834
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,511
Mom's good at this game.

835
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,807
Nice psychological trick
there, kid.

836
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:08,933
I see what you did.

837
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,643
I don't know what that means.

838
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:16,107
It means you have tapped
into my sibling-rivalry side.

839
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,027
Let's do this!

840
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,489
All right. Here we go.

841
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,953
Just a little, uh...
a little rusty.

842
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,455
It's the wind.

843
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,707
Yep, wind's blowing that way,
so you gotta...

844
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,000
trajectory, you know.

845
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,335
You'll learn it later.
Uh, okay, here we go.

846
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,629
So...

847
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,964
[gasps]

848
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,633
[sheepish chuckle]
Sorry.

849
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,717
Just...

850
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,177
uh...

851
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,637
Hey, batter-batter,
hey, batter.

852
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,846
Hey, batter, hey, batter!

853
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:47,889
Sah-wing, batter-- oh!

854
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:51,226
[crow squawks]

855
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,310
Okay...

856
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:53,728
hi.

857
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,856
Hi. See, the problem is,
sometimes, I'm so strong,

858
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,024
I don't-- oh!

859
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,192
[phone ringing]

860
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,361
Oh, I gotta take this.
Uh...

861
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,696
you, um--

862
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:03,571
-Hello?
-You know, uh, just...

863
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,906
[Kathleen] Sam?

864
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,199
Here, just play a few--

865
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:06,908
-Hello?
-...Hundred rounds on me, okay?

866
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,118
Uh... hi, Sis!

867
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,285
Hey, how's it going?

868
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:10,870
Hey. I'm calling
to give you an update

869
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:11,871
on the baby.

870
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,206
Where are you?

871
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,208
Oh, we're at the Christmas Fair
with Dania,

872
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,877
-where she has just won...
-[crowd applauding]

873
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,878
...Another stuffed reindeer!

874
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,921
Go, you!

875
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,548
Good job!

876
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:23,216
You know, I actually think
she's found her life calling.

877
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:24,384
Aren't you supposed to be

878
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,844
doing the crafts
that I scheduled for now?

879
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,721
Uh, yeah, well, we're gonna get
to that in a little bit.

880
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:30,473
Sam! It is really important
to stay on schedule.

881
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,725
Kids need structure.

882
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,560
Is everything okay
with the baby?

883
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,145
Yes, thankfully.

884
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,689
Things are just taking a little
longer than anticipated.

885
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,566
Well, you think you're gonna
be back by Christmas?

886
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,068
So far, we're still
on track for that,

887
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,903
but it's gonna be closer
than we thought.

888
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,238
Where's Miles?

889
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,614
He's auditioning
for the Christmas play.

890
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,284
Ohh! The play!

891
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,327
I totally forgot about that.

892
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,954
Yeah, Jason didn't.
He's with him right now.

893
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,748
Jason?

894
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,916
Yeah, your neighbor with like
a thousand nieces and nephews?

895
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,001
He's helping me with the kids.

896
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,961
I figured that's okay,
since, well...

897
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,671
you left them with him
until I arrived.

898
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,340
No.

899
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:05,425
That's fine.
Jason's great with kids.

900
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,427
Yeah, and also
very good-looking

901
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,262
and gay!

902
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,223
And how come you never
told me about him before?

903
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,767
I thought about it when
he first moved in next door,

904
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,143
but you two
are very different.

905
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,645
He's really serious about
having a family, Sam.

906
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,438
And you're...

907
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,106
I'm...?

908
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:20,940
[non-committal grunt]

909
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,650
Kath!

910
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,612
Dr. March called.

911
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,821
We're back on!

912
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:27,947
[gasps] Gotta go, Sam!

913
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:28,990
No, no, no, no! Don't go! I--

914
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,867
W-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

915
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,535
[texts chiming]

916
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,829
[***]

917
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,502
Dania?
Don't forget your winnings.

918
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,755
[***]

919
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,383
[exhaling deeply]

920
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,967
Hey, what'd you want
to talk about?

921
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,260
Here.

922
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,887
I'll be in in a second.

923
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,222
Got it.

924
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,557
[Dania] I am so in love
with my reindeers.

925
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,768
[Miles] There are a lot of them!
Have you named them?

926
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,811
[Dania] Not yet.

927
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,145
[door creaks shut]

928
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,522
So, my brother, Eddie,

929
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,981
is directing
the Christmas play this year,

930
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,942
and he said that the only reason
that Miles got the part

931
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,069
is because the other kid
trying out

932
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,070
gets queasy
when he's nervous.

933
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,321
I think he was off

934
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,989
because my niece
was talking with another boy.

935
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,700
Ah, yes.

936
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,703
Young love is tough.

937
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,788
Old love's not much better.

938
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,123
What do we do?

939
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,332
Well, I was thinking--

940
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,667
since you said
you'd done plays before--

941
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,002
that you might have
some advice for him.

942
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,586
No, that was many years ago.

943
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:24,629
Were you any good?

944
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:25,839
I was.

945
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,174
Uh, despite the lederhosen.

946
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,592
Somehow,
I knew you would be.

947
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,262
I can't tell--
is that a compliment?

948
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,930
It's an opportunity for Miles.

949
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,724
Maybe you can
give him some tips?

950
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,726
Oh... I don't know.

951
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,354
He doesn't seem
to particularly like me.

952
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,398
Because he's a teenager!
All adults are boring.

953
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,858
Yeah, but he listens to you.

954
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,526
Yeah, because I'm connected
to the girl he likes.

955
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,486
Right.

956
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,407
I'll see what I can do.

957
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:53,825
Thanks.

958
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,163
Sh...

959
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,914
-Should we go in?
-Yeah, want to go in?

960
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:01,624
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

961
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,968
That's an interesting
fashion choice.

962
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,136
[chuckles]

963
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,304
My shoes weren't
the only thing

964
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,430
that got hit
with the green batter.

965
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,974
My sweater got nailed, too.

966
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,476
I had to switch.

967
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,311
And you just happened to have
a Christmas aloha shirt?

968
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,729
Festive, right?

969
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,813
I was packed

970
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,482
for my trip to Hawaii
for Christmas

971
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:27,317
when Kathleen ambushed me.

972
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,485
You know, it was easier

973
00:34:28,526 --> 00:34:29,944
to throw in a couple sweaters
and pants

974
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,863
than to totally repack,

975
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,490
especially since
I'm headed to the airport

976
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,033
as soon as they get home.

977
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,910
You're spending Christmas
in Hawaii?

978
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:37,994
By yourself?

979
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,162
Trying to.

980
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,289
My goal
is to unplug and relax.

981
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,999
Best I can.

982
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,334
But it's Christmas.

983
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:46,211
Don't you want to spend it
with your family?

984
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,005
My parents got divorced,
like, 20 years ago.

985
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,590
Mom's in Italy.

986
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,342
Dad spends most of his time
at the lake house--

987
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,094
he's retired.

988
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,220
What about coming here?

989
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:56,513
[ringing]

990
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:58,014
Hold on.

991
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,808
Oh! One sec.

992
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,059
Hey, Duchess.

993
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,645
Yes, we received
your request to have

994
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,189
all the toys donated anonymously
to the school.

995
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:07,691
[door opens]

996
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,818
Yes, we are right on top of it,
don't worry, mm-hmm.

997
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:12,195
-Knock-knock!
-Oh, hi, Mom, come on in.

998
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,655
Oh, okay, yes!

999
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,032
And a ve-- very Merry Christmas
to you, too.

1000
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,701
All right. Bye-bye. Have fun.

1002
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,787
Sorry, a VIP client.

1003
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:21,830
Oh.

1004
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,665
Arf-arf!

Oh, I'm okay.
I'm a li-- ahh!

Good. Okay.

Oh!

-[groaning]
-I'm so sorry.

Murphy associates
plush toys with fetch.

1022

Kathleen's gonna kill me.

00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,283
She totally is.

00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,243
We can fix it.
Do not worry.

00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,331
Are you one of Jason's sisters?

1028
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:06,875
I like you already,
Sam Dalton.

1029
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,959
Meet my mom.

1030
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:09,419
Impossible!

1031
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,463
You're too young
to have seven kids!

1032

He just gets better and better.

1033
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,091
I came to drop off cookies,

1034
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,593
but also to remind Jason

1035
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:20,138
that it's the family
Christmas lights walk tonight.

1036
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,473
Christmas lights walk?

1037
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:23,391
It's a neighborhood tradition--

1038
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:24,851
incredibly festive.

1039
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,728
Oh! Can we go with the DeVitos
tonight, please?

1040
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,689
Oh. Uh, well,
we don't want to impose.

1041

-Oh--
-Honey, please, no. [laughs]

1042
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,986
Our family motto is...
"the more, the merrier".

1043
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,990
I guess we're going on
a lights walk, huh?

1044
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,367
What about the angel?

1045
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:42,285
Here we go. Ready?

1046
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:43,953
One, two, three, up!
There you go!

All right, right up on top.
Look how pretty.

So, Sam, is this
your first time to Brayden?

1053
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:06,643
Uh, no, actually,
I was here five years ago.

1054
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,437
Oh, right--
the kitchen incident!

No. No, no, no.

1058
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,029
Pop, here, and I run
DeVito General Store,

1059
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,323
so all the contractors
come to us for all the supplies.

1060
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,324
All of 'em?

1061
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,659
[family] All of them!

1062
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,036
As well as my youngest,

-for good!
-Mm. [chuckles]

Where were you before?

00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:30,917
Los Angeles.

1067
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,585
But you're here now,

1068
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,796

00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,347
This is supposed to be

1083
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,538
That's Kevin and Logan.

1084
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,914
Kevin grew up in Brayden

1085
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,000
and when he moved back,
he brought Logan with him.

1086
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,543
Oh, another relative?

1087
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,378
No. Kevin was
my high-school boyfr--

1088
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,963
[thud]

1089
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,631
-You okay?
-Yep!

1090
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:21,009
That shrub just attacked me!

1091
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,927
I'm beginning to think
you have an inner-ear disorder.

1092
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,429
Hilarious.

1093
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,388
[Sam laughs nervously]

1094
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,723
You were saying?

1095
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,141
Kevin?

1096
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,517
Uh...

1097
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,853
Kevin and I
broke up in college,

1098
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:33,605
which is where
he met Logan.

1099
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:35,857
Oh. Is he the one
that got away?

1100
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,192
No!

1101
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,985
No, Kevin and Logan
are perfect for each other.

1102
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:41,696
I'm really happy for them.
They're good people.

1103
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,740
I'm sensing a "but..."

1104
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,744
Sometimes, I envy
what they have.

1105
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:49,079
Ever since I can remember,

1106
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,289
I've wanted to fall in love,
get married,

1107
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,167
become a dad.

1108
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,419
Your happily-ever-after?

1109
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,005
Somethin' like that.
What about you?

1110
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,548
Oh.

1111
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,051
I don't know about
"happily ever after".

1112
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,594
I-I go on dates,

1113
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,430
I just barely make it
to a second one.

1114
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,265
Why?

1115
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:10,975
If you ask
my best friend, Ellie,

1116
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,269
it's because I'm always
looking for a reason to run.

1117
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,188
Don't ask me why.

1118
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,898
Well, maybe it's easy
to find a reason to run

1119
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,693
if there's not
a better reason to stay.

1120
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,195
I'm totally
quoting you on that.

1121
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,988
You're welcome.

1122
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,036
Well, I'm...

1123
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,454
sure you'll find your guy
eventually.

1124
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,123
Yeah.

1125
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,166
But I'm tired of waiting for
my happily-ever-after to start.

1126
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,210
What does that mean?

1127
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:38,461
After this Christmas,

1128
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,130
I am starting
the adoption process.

1129
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,716
That's what I needed
the retainer fee for.

1130
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,509
No more waiting.

1131
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,344
I'm gonna have
my happily-ever-after,

1132
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,680
even if I gotta do it on my own.

1133
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:52,058
[***]

1134
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,275
[***]

1135
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,112
Nate...

1136
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,034
...She's a Christmas baby.

1137
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,453
I know.

1138
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,456
You softie.

1139
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,460
I know.

1140
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,546
[phone buzzes]

1141
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,966
Your mom or mine?

1142
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:25,967
Mine.

1143
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:26,926
[buzz]

1144
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:28,136
Oh, no... now yours.

1145
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:30,472
They want updates.

1146
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,934
Should we start
telling everyone?

1147
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,021
Not yet.

1148
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:41,399
I want to savor this moment
a little longer.

1149
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,986
[***]

1150
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,872
We'll be together
once again

1151
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:58,124
This Christmas

1152
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,043
Stop.

1153
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,170
Ugh.

1154
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,297
Stop trying
to make fetch happen.

1155
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,634
Time with the loved ones
Hanging gifts...

1156
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,136
Oh...

1157
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:12,555
Excuse me, gotta get up,
excuse me.

1158
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,808
[***]

1159
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,476
[footsteps]

1160
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:17,644
[Jason] Good morning.

1161
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,813
Morning!

1162
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,898
I figured,
since you're paying me,

1163
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,066
the least I can do

1164
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,067
is come in early
and make breakfast.

1165
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,486
Well, I applaud
your reasoning.

1166
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,445
[sniffing]

1167
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,863
Why do I smell coffee?

1168
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,366
Oh...

1169
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,704
Oh, ho, ho, ho... ho!

1170
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,831
That's it--
I am paying you double.

1171
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,791
I'll add it to the bill.

1172
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,501
-Oh.
-Have you heard anything

1173
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,502
from your sister
about the baby?

1174
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,295
Ah, not yet.

1175
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:46,923
I texted them last night,
but no response.

1176
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,843
When's your flight to Hawaii?

1177
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,636
Christmas Eve afternoon.

1178
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,346
Depending on
when they get back.

1179
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,556
That's tomorrow.

1180
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,141
You're gonna miss Miles' play.

1181
00:41:58,018 --> 00:42:00,562
I didn't know about it
when I changed my reservation.

1182
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,526
[impressed]
Santa waffles!

1183
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:07,861
I have many skills.

1184
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:08,903
Apparently.

1185
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:10,488
Can I help?

1186
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,990
Sure.

1187
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,702
Okay. Uh...

1188
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,746
how do we do this?

1189
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,205
Strawberries.

1190
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:21,708
'Kay.

1191
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,877
Just lay 'em down here?

1192
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:25,045
Yeah, start at the top.

1193
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,087
Okay.

1194
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,172
Good.

1195
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:30,050
Now all he needs
is a fluffy white beard.

1196
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,552
Okay.

1197
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:33,553
How's that?

1198
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,597
I think you got it.

1199
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,143
Waffles?

1200
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,396
Hey! Miles.

1201
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,065
Good morning!

1202
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:47,567
Uh, how-how--
how are the lines coming?

1203
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:49,235
Mr. D said

1204
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:50,570
I could keep the script
during the performance,

1205
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,238
since it's tomorrow,

1206
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,408
and I won't be able to memorize
all the lines by then.

1207
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,576
Smart.

1208
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,286
I'm not very good.

1209
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,581
Well, if you want,
I can help you.

1210
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:04,501
I did some Christmas plays
when I was younger.

1211
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,461
Okay.

1212
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:09,422
I mean, I need all the help
I can get.

1213
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,341
Okay! Great. Yeah.

1214
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,051
Uh, after breakfast?

1215
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,512
Why don't you go
wake up your sister?

1216
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:17,222
It is... waffle time!

1217
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:18,765
Waffle time.

1218
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,892
Can I get a "ho, ho, ho"?

1219
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:21,810
Let me hear ya, Miles!

1220
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:23,770
"Ho, ho, ho!"

1221
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,271
I'm starting to feel a bond.

1222
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:26,690
[laughs]

1223
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:29,651
[***]

1224
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,111
Okay, thanks.

1225
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:32,696
Hey.

1226
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:33,738
[groans]
What are you here for?

1227
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,948
Extra paint.

1228
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:36,324
I want to finish
the nursery tonight,

1229
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,118
in case Nate and Kathleen
get home tomorrow.

1230
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,536
-Oh, fun.
-Hey, what's with the limp?

1231
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:42,038
Huh? Oh. Got a blister
last night at the lights walk.

1232
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,039
Can you believe it?

1233
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:44,124
Oh, that's no fun.

1234
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:45,458
Well, it was actually fun.

1235
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,920
Helped get me outta
my post-divorce funk, so...

1236
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,839
Anyway, how about you?

1237
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,007
You and Sam
and the kids have fun?

1238
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:55,468
Yeah. We did, actually.

1239
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,388
What?

1240
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,473
Nothing. Ahem.

1241
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:01,808
Mom thinks he's single.

1242
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,143
How would Mom know that?

1243
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:04,561
I don't know,
maybe it's just a Mom skill.

1244
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,230
She does it with women for me,
you know. I mean, now.

1245
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:08,690
Hmm.

1246
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:10,483
Well, Sam and I haven't
talked about that sort of thing.

1247
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:13,278
I'm just helping him
with the kids for a couple days

1248
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,155
while he's here,
and that's it.

1249
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:17,115
Right. Mom said
he lives in Manhattan.

1250
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,325
Not too far away from you,
if you wanted to date.

1251
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:21,327
Who said anything
about dating?

1252
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:22,412
Do you?

1253
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:25,832
I just came for paint.

1254
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,376
Oh, come on!
So, do you want to date him?

1255
00:44:28,418 --> 00:44:30,670
What I want
is to start a family,

1256
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,006
and not Sam's thing.

1257
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,966
I thought you didn't
talk about that.

1258
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,676
Not with Sam.

1259
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:37,677
[sets paint can down]

1260
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,012
Kathleen had mentioned

1261
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,388
when I first
moved back to Brayden,

1262
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,848
about maybe
setting me and Sam up.

1263
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,100
Well, that sounds promising.

1264
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,852
Yeah. Until I told her that
I wanted to start a family,

1265
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:47,062
and then she said

1266
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:48,438
Sam and I wouldn't
be a good fit.

1267
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,107
Apparently, he's kind of
a permanent bachelor,

1268
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:53,234
and not the settling-down
and starting-a-family kinda guy.

1269
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:54,402
Maybe.

1270
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:56,029
Or maybe you let him
tell you that,

1271
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:57,864
one way or the other.

1272
00:44:57,906 --> 00:45:00,158
I mean,
i-if you're interested.

1273
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,660
[sighs] Mm-hmm.

1274
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,624
Okay, let's restart with
the opening paragraph, okay?

1275
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:09,459
'Kay.

1276
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:13,129
[monotonously] "Many of you know
of the man we call Santa Claus,

1277
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:15,048
but today you're going to hear
about how he came to be."

1278
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,050
Okay. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

1279
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:18,301
Uh, we'll do it again,
but first things first--

1280
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,303
let's do posture, okay?

1281
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:22,889
Uh, stand straight. Okay.
Very good.

1282
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,517
Shoulders back. Feet planted!

1283
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:26,559
Head up.

1284
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:28,561
Now you look confident!

1285
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:30,230
But I'm not.

1286
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,775
But you lookconfident--
and that is half the battle.

1287
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:38,071
Bookmark that for the rest
of your life-- it's useful.

1288
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:40,073
See, posture helps
with your breathing,

1289
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:41,658
which helps your voice,

1290
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,202
which we want to make larger,
not louder.

1291
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:46,079
Okay? So, one comes
from the throat,

1292
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:47,622
one comes from the chest.

1293
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,374
[deeply] We want to talk
down here in our chest.

1294
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,834
[squeaky] We don't want to be
up here in our... throat.

1295
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,836
This is a lot.

1296
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,046
It's standing, breathing,
and talking.

1297
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,340
You're doing
all three right now.

1298
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,717
You learned all this
just by doing some plays

1299
00:45:58,758 --> 00:45:59,718
when you were my age?

1300
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:04,889
No. I actually took
some speech classes in college.

1301
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:06,307
I was shy back then.

1302
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:08,226
-You were?
-I was!

1303
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:11,604
Teenage years
are not easy on anybody,

1304
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,023
but I promise you...

1305
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:14,733
it does get better.

1306
00:46:14,774 --> 00:46:17,444
Little things that you're doing
along the way--

1307
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:19,446
like this play--

1308
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:20,947
they all help.

1309
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:22,532
[takes a deep breath]

1310
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:24,242
There we go!

1311
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:26,202
All right! Let's do this. Ready?

1312
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:28,621
In three...
two, one--

1313
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:29,664
action!

1314
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,416
[deep breath]

1315
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:33,877
[forced] "Many of you know
of the man we call Santa Claus,

1316
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,670
but today you're going to hear
about how he came to be."

1317
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,630
[blows air]

1318
00:46:37,672 --> 00:46:40,383
Okay, this time, let's try
breathing and talking--

1319
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:41,468
same time.

1320
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:42,969
[***]

1321
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:44,554
[phone chimes]

1322
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:48,141
What?

1323
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:50,518
[chuckling]

1324
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:54,689
[***]

1325
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:03,448
[alert chimes]

1326
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:10,997
[ringing]

1327
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,665
[Sam] Looks like
I'm an uncle again!

1328
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:14,417
Congratulations.

1329
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,211
When can you get home?

1330
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:18,672
We're gonna video call
with Kathleen and Nate soon.

1331
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:20,715
I'm on my way.

1332
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:23,718
[***]

1333
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:39,109
[Sam, gushing]
Hello, hello, hello!

1334
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,653
Oh, you're so cute!
Look at her!

1335
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:42,862
[baby babbles]

1336
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:44,364
What's her name?

1337
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:46,825
Uh, we're still
working on that.

1338
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,827
Are you going to be back
in time for Christmas?

1339
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:51,246
Uh, we're gonna do our best,
honey, yeah.

1340
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,164
It's snowing very hard
outside, though.

1341
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,624
But you promised.

1342
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,794
We did...
and we're gonna be there.

1343
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,963
Can your sedan handle
traveling in so much snow?

1344
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:01,423
I'm not sure.

1345
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,924
What about an airplane?

1346
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,010
We can't take your sister
on an airplane, sweetie--

1347
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:07,303
she's just too young.

1348
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:08,596
Have you asked Dad
for help?

1349
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:10,265
His cabin's less than
an hour from Buffalo

1350
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:12,308
and he's got that huge SUV.

1351
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,852
You guys could drive together,
to be safe.

1352
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:16,021
Dad would be great,
if we could reach him,

1353
00:48:16,062 --> 00:48:17,480
but he has no cell reception

1354
00:48:17,522 --> 00:48:18,940
and he never
answers the landline.

1355
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:19,983
What about Mr. Biddle?

1356
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,651
He's a neighbor
closer to town.

1357
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,278
Mom calls him
to drive up to Dad's place

1358
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,280
to tell him to call her
all the time.

1359
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:26,781
But Mom's in Italy.

1360
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,992
I guess I could try
to get her attention

1361
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,410
to get Mr. Biddle's number?

1362
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,661
I have his number.

1363
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:32,996
You do?

1364
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,165
Yeah. I went fishing there
every summer with Dad

1365
00:48:35,206 --> 00:48:36,666
-until I was 16.
-You fished?

1366
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:37,417
Weird, right?

1367
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:38,710
That's a good idea.

1368
00:48:39,669 --> 00:48:41,421
That's a really good idea, Sam.

1369
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,382
[***]

1370
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:48,053
[sighs]

1371
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:50,263
Did you see the look
in Dania's eyes?

1372
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,389
If we're not back
in time for Christmas,

1373
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:53,892
she will never forgive us.

1374
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:57,354
Sam will reach your dad,
then he'll drive lead for us,

1375
00:48:57,395 --> 00:49:00,357
and we'll make it home
in time for Christmas.

1376
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:02,776
We have to be safe about it.
Right?

1377
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,403
[***]

1378
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,616
Thank you so much, Mr. Biddle.

1379
00:49:09,657 --> 00:49:11,076
It's really important
that I talk to Dad.

1380
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:14,245
[quietly]
Oh, no. Stavros.

1381
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:15,330
[buzzing]

1382
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:16,831
What was that?

1383
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,250
Oh, yeah, it has been a while
since I've been fishing.

1384
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,877
Uh-huh.

1385
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,379
This summer? Okay.

1386
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,880
Um, maybe we can do that.

1387
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:25,548
We can come up with Dad,
go to the cabin--

1388
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,050
it'll be a whole thing.

1389
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:28,843
Yep!

1390
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:31,596
Yes! Thank you--
thank you so much!

1391
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,932
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1392
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,941
Oh! Nice work.

1393
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:45,318
Ah, thanks.

1394
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,611
I always find painting
to be soothing.

1395
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:49,906
Can I help?

1396
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,574
You might get paint
on your nice sweater.

1397
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:53,118
Oh...

1398
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:54,536
a-ha.

1399
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:08,717
So...

1400
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,053
I changed my departure
to Christmas Day,

1401
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,764
a-after the presents from Santa
have been opened,

1402
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:16,307
of course.

1403
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,560
I mean, even if they do make it
back in time for the play,

1404
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:19,853
they're going to be wiped out.

1405
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,187
Makes sense.

1406
00:50:21,229 --> 00:50:24,107
Oh. And Kathleen wanted me
to wrap some presents,

1407
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:27,902
so I'm gonna do that while
you and Miles are at rehearsal.

1408
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,154
And what about Dania?

1409
00:50:29,195 --> 00:50:30,613
She'll be around.

1410
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:31,573
Right!

1411
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:32,866
I'm still getting used

1412
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:35,076
to this whole sneaky-parent
behavior thing.

1413
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,746
You missed a spot.

1414
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,165
Yes, dear.

1415
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:41,583
[laughs]

1416
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,251
I can help you.

1417
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:44,794
Wrap the presents,
if you like.

1418
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:45,920
When?

1419
00:50:45,962 --> 00:50:47,589
After rehearsal.

1420
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:49,424
Maybe you and Dania
can come, too,

1421
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:50,633
and then, afterwards,

1422
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:51,301
we can wrap the presents
when they're asleep.

1423
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:52,802
I have to earn

1424
00:50:52,844 --> 00:50:54,971
my "uncle consultant" keep,
after all.

1425
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:56,639
[chuckles]

1426
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:01,478
So, the...

1427
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,272
retainer fee was for
the adoption lawyer, huh?

1428
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:05,815
Yeah, the same
as Kathleen and Nate's.

1429
00:51:05,857 --> 00:51:07,817
They're helping me
through the process.

1430
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,194
It's a big step--

1431
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:10,862
being a single parent.

1432
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,531
I mean, I'm exhausted
just co-uncling with you.

1433
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,868
And now you sound like
everyone else I know...

1434
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,286
especially the guys
I used to date

1435
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:19,662
back in Los Angeles.

1436
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,706
Was it bad?

1437
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,334
Not bad so much as
just disheartening.

1438
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:26,503
You know,
I'd date a guy for a while

1439
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:27,879
and then, as soon as it got
to the...

1440
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:30,340
"Oh, you're serious about
having the family?" thing,

1441
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:31,216
they just ghosted.

1442
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:33,760
The last guy
went to the bathroom

1443
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,053
and he just never came back.

1444
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,638
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

1445
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,557
So, I paid the check

1446
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,560
and then started making plans
to move home to Brayden.

1447
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:45,230
Well...
I would never do that to you.

1448
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:47,148
You'd at least
pay the check.

1449
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,650
[laughs] Right?

1450
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,696
[***]

1451
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,126
-Hey.
-Hey.

1452
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:08,044
How'd it go?

1453
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,713
Better?

1454
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:12,674
And then Arabella
came on stage with Declan,

1455
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:14,467
and Miles got off-track.

1456
00:52:14,509 --> 00:52:16,845
Well, we still have a day.

1457
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:19,806
It's a Christmas play
in a community theater--

1458
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:22,517
no one's expecting Shakespeare,

1459
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,103
except maybe
a couple of parents.

1460
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:30,400
My goal is for the kids
to learn and have fun.

1461
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:33,903
It doesn't seem like
Miles is having any fun.

1462
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:35,530
Yeah.

1463
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,740
I mean, if need be,
I can read the narrator's--

1464
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,700
No.

1465
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,243
That would
embarrass Miles even more.

1466
00:52:40,285 --> 00:52:42,037
Look. Brother favor?

1467
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:43,913
Don't decide yet.

1468
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:45,623
Sam and I'll see
what we can do.

1469
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,003
[casually] Sure.

1470
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:54,966
[***]

1471
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:57,677
[phone buzzing]

1472
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,097
Mm. Hold this.
I'll be right back.

1473
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,932
Dad! Hey!

1474
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:06,144
Hey! Bert Biddle
came up to my place today

1475
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,438
to tell me that my family
was looking for me?

1476
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,482
Is everything okay?

1477
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:12,734
Yes, actually.
The news is all good.

1478
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,486
You're a grandpa again!

1479
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,446
From you?

1480
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,740
What? No. Dad, come on.

1481
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,659
Right? I mean,
that's why I was confused!

1482
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:23,536
It's Kathleen and Nate.
Remember the baby

1483
00:53:23,578 --> 00:53:25,080
that was supposed to come
New Year's Day?

1484
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:26,164
Well,

1485
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,249
she came early
and they're stuck

1486
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,584
in a snowstorm
and it's gonna--

1487
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,003
[sighs] You know what?
Let me back up to the part

1488
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:35,382
where you get the chance
to save Christmas.

1489
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:45,642
Jingle bells

1490
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:46,935
Thank you.

1491
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:49,187
Jingle bells
Jingle all the way

1492
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,689
Boop!

1493
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,648
What fun it is to ride

1494
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,108
Thank you.

1495
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:54,192
[Sam laughs]

1496
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:55,318
Jingle bells

1497
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,403
I think it looks cute.

1498
00:53:58,279 --> 00:53:59,906
Oh, okay.

1499
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:01,741
So...

1500
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,619
how are
we gonna wrap that?

1501
00:54:04,661 --> 00:54:06,579
Lotta tape, my friend.

1502
00:54:06,621 --> 00:54:07,580
Dashin' through the snow

1503
00:54:07,622 --> 00:54:08,957
Okay!

1504
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:10,500
Okay.

1505
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,961
O'er the fields we go

1506
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,754
-[words catch]
-No, not this way.

1507
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,256
[paper rustling]

1508
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:17,757
Nope, that's...

1509
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:18,800
[Jason chuckles softly]

1510
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:20,510
Oh... okay.

1511
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:21,678
[grunting]

1512
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,888
Okay... around.

1513
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:28,351
That's a disaster.

1514
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,269
No, it's perfect.

1515
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,687
[laughing]

1516
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,063
It's so bad.

1517
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:37,068
So, what do you want to do?

1518
00:54:38,236 --> 00:54:39,446
About Miles?

1519
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,073
I can talk to him tomorrow.

1520
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,325
You know,
see if I can come up

1521
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,119
with any techniques
that'll help him focus.

1522
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,163
I can watch Dania
while you do,

1523
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:51,458
maybe I can finally get her
to make the Christmas stocking.

1524
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:53,001
About that--

1525
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,712
...I feel like
I'm taking advantage of you.

1526
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:57,422
What do you mean?

1527
00:54:57,464 --> 00:55:00,008
O-Our original deal was for
a couple of days, at most.

1528
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,801
We're headed into day four,

1529
00:55:01,843 --> 00:55:04,262
if you count you watching them
before I arrived.

1530
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:06,431
I don't.

1531
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,391
But I do.

1532
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:10,060
The nursery's almost done--

1533
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:12,645
you must have other things
you have to do.

1534
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:15,482
It slows down
around the holidays.

1535
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:17,442
Besides, I'd feel like
I was quitting in the middle

1536
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:18,651
if I left now.

1537
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:20,487
But don't consider it
part of, you know,

1538
00:55:20,528 --> 00:55:22,113
the payment.

1539
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:24,115
Of course, I'd consider it
part of the payment.

1540
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:27,202
I'm not gonna take advantage
of your kindness.

1541
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:33,124
[***]

1542
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:35,377
[Dania] Uncle Sam?

1543
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,380
[both panicking]

1544
00:55:41,132 --> 00:55:42,425
Hey!

1545
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,260
What are you doing up?

1546
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,471
Can we talk?

1547
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,099
Okay.

1548
00:55:58,233 --> 00:55:59,859
Knock-knock.

1549
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:01,319
Can I come in?

1550
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:02,278
Yeah.

1551
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:07,367
[***]

1552
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,035
What's going on?

1553
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,996
I miss Mom and Dad.

1554
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,582
What if they don't make it
back here for Christmas?

1555
00:56:14,624 --> 00:56:16,584
Well, you know, they're doing
everything in their power

1556
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:18,712
to make it back here in time,

1557
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,630
but they gotta
be safe about it.

1558
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,298
I know.

1559
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,633
It's just...

1560
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,177
I wish they hadn't gone away
in the first place.

1561
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:30,890
You know...

1562
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:34,227
I'm a little bit older
than your mom...

1563
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:37,439
and, so, I got to be
an only child for a while,

1564
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,733
and I have to say...

1565
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:41,568
I really liked it.

1566
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,236
Like, a lot.

1567
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:44,988
Then, one day,

1568
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,740
my mom and dad told me

1569
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:48,450
that I was gonna be
a big brother...

1570
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:52,829
...and I didn't like that.

1571
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:54,789
You didn't like Mom?

1572
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:57,250
No, it wasn't your mom.

1573
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,918
It was the fact

1574
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,130
that I wasn't gonna be
the only one anymore.

1575
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:06,426
I was scared my parents
wouldn't love me the same.

1576
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:08,136
Did they?

1577
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:09,763
They did.

1578
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:11,181
Just the same.

1579
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:14,017
And you having a little sister

1580
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,811
isn't gonna change
how your parents feel about you,

1581
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:18,772
or Miles.

1582
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,899
They will always love you...

1583
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,442
because you...

1584
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:24,027
are you.

1585
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,321
You really think so?

1586
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,491
I know so.

1587
00:57:29,532 --> 00:57:30,742
[relieved chuckle]

1588
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:32,494
Thanks, Uncle Sam.

1589

[***]

1590
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,506
Now you need
to get some sleep.

Wah-shh!

[***]

1598
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:27,632
Whoa.

1599
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,384
Did you order all this in?

1600
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:30,802
No!

1601
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:33,847
Made freshly,
by yours truly.

1602
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:36,766
With plenty of vegan options
for milady.

1603
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:37,851
Thanks!

1604
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:39,185
You cooked with fire?

1605
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,187
Okay, now you make me
sound like a caveman,

1606
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:43,273
which I strangely like.

1607
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:47,152
But yes,
I cooked with fire, and yes,

1608
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:48,778
the place
is still standing.

1609
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,198
Feel free to put thatin
your Brayden gossip-group chat.

1610
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,324
What?

1611
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:55,035
[slow-claps]

1612

Thank you! Thank you!

00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:03,376
Thank you!
Thank you!

1616
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:05,128
Come on, eat, eat,
before it gets cold.

1617
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,131
[***]

1618
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:11,551
Up, milady, I'll push you in.

1619
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,095
[***]

1620
00:59:16,514 --> 00:59:17,891
Where's Dad?

1621
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,726
Maybe he's out of cell range?

1622
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,562
We're in upstate New York,
not the North Pole.

1623
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:23,646
[knocking]

1624
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:24,606
That'll be room service.

1625
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:26,900
Dad!

1626
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:28,902
-[laughing]
-Hi!

1627
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:31,029
Sam says
I'm a grandpa again?

1628
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:32,947
Yes, you are.

1629
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:34,032
[gasping]

1630
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,826
Oh, my goodness.

1631
00:59:36,868 --> 00:59:38,578
Oh...

1632
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,455
well done.

1633
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,791
It's your grandpa.
It's your grandpa.

1634
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:46,503
Hey.

1635
00:59:46,544 --> 00:59:48,004
Uh, I'm gonna
take Murph for a walk

1636
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,714
and then get ready
for tonight.

1637
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:51,549
And there's this.

1638
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:52,884
This?

1639
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,511
It's an early
Christmas present.

1640
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,600
[laughs]

1641
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:02,102
Really?

1642
01:00:02,143 --> 01:00:04,145
Worth it to see that expression
right there.

1643
01:00:04,187 --> 01:00:06,398
And there's more.

1644
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:11,236
[***]

1645
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,738
I figured you'd want
something for tonight

1646
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,323
and...

1647
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,826
I thought that color would
look really good on you.

1648
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,621
Thank you.

1649
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,289
It's perfect.

1650
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,002
Okay.

1651
01:00:27,043 --> 01:00:28,837
Well...

1652
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:30,880
see you later.

1653
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,299
[***]

1654
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:37,887
[exhales deeply
as door closes]

1655
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:41,850
[***]

1656
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,185
[Sam] There you are!

1657
01:00:46,187 --> 01:00:49,524
I wanted to get it done
before Santa shows up.

1658
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:53,737
"Baby Sister".

1659
01:00:53,778 --> 01:00:55,280
Since we don't know her name.

1660
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:57,365
I'll make another one for her
next year.

1661
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:01,453
Mm-hmm. What?

1662
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,664
[words catch]

1663
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:05,832
[chuckles]

1664
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:07,375
You need one, too.

1665
01:01:09,836 --> 01:01:11,671
Thank you.

1666
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:13,048
We'll hang 'em up

1667
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:15,592
when we get back
from the play tonight.

1668
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:20,555
[***]

1669
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:30,732
[***]

1670
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,525
Is everyone ready?

1671
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:33,777
Ready!

1672
01:01:33,818 --> 01:01:34,778
[less certain] Ready.

1673
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:36,196
Ready.

1674
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:38,531
Then let's go.

1675
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:41,451
Come on.

1676
01:01:51,294 --> 01:01:53,922
[***]

1677
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,054
Here!

1678
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,223
Got it.

1679
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:05,475
-There?
-There.

1680
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:06,976
Jason?

1681
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:08,520
-Backup?
-Backup.

1682
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:10,605
So many!

1683
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:11,815
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1684
01:02:11,856 --> 01:02:13,191
Oh. Yeah.

1685
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,026
Kathleen and Nate are delayed
because of the snow,

1686
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,404
so she texted me to make sure
I capture everything.

1687
01:02:17,445 --> 01:02:19,197
Oh, well, I'm glad
you're here for this.

1688
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,490
Me too.

1689
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,534
Although, I might be
a little bit more nervous

1690
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:23,868
than Miles
at this point.

1691
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,996
It's close.

1692
01:02:27,038 --> 01:02:30,083
Oh, well, it doesn't get easier
and I've seen dozens of these.

1693
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,501
Though...

1694
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:34,796
[quietly] ...Arabella says
Miles is wonderful.

1695
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,339
She did?

1696
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:38,967
Probably helps that she has
a little crush on him.

1697
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:40,844
She does?

1698
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:42,679
That's why she wanted him
to be in the play,

1699
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:45,807
though she's too shy
to admit it.

1700
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:47,058
Grandmas know things.

1701
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,395
They do.

1702
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,230
Will you excuse me
for a moment?

1703
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:53,189
Of course.

1704
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:54,858
[exhales eagerly]

1705
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:57,694
[***]

1706
01:02:57,736 --> 01:02:59,195
[anxiously] "Santa stacked
six singing snowmen

1707
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:00,822
in his sonic sleigh."

1708
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:01,698
Miles!

1709
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,033
She likes you!

1710
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,618
-What?
-Arabella!

1711
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,871
She likes you,
not "Decker."

1712
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:09,539
-Declan.
-Whatever!

1713
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,041
I heard it straight
from her grandma's mouth.

1714
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:12,834
She likes you, dude!

1715
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:13,960
Wow!

1716
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:15,503
Now I'm more nervous.

1717
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:17,464
What? No, no, no, buddy!

1718
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:19,132
This is your chance to shine.

1719
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,384
You got this!

1720
01:03:21,426 --> 01:03:23,219
Let me hear you say it, okay?

1721
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:25,055
[unconfident]
I got this.

1722
01:03:25,096 --> 01:03:26,181
"I got this!"

1723
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:27,349
[more comfortable]
I got this.

1724
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,224
[passionately] "I got this!"

1725
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,225
I got this!

1726
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:30,435
[roars] "I got this!"

1727
01:03:30,477 --> 01:03:32,062
[crew] Shh!

1728
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,190
Good luck!

1729
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:36,816
I knew it!

1730
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:41,404
[exhales with resolve]

1731
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:44,282
Hi, everybody,
and Merry Christmas!

1732
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:45,909
You can go ahead
and grab your seats now.

1733
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,328
We'd like to thank you all
for coming out tonight

1734
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,746
and welcome you

1735
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:53,667
to T he Life and Adventures
of Santa Claus!

1736
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,960
[applause]

1737
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:03,093
[cheering and applause]

1738
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:10,141
[confidently]
Good evening

1739
01:04:10,183 --> 01:04:11,643
and Merry Christmas Eve.

1740
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:15,772
Many of you know of the man
we call Santa Claus.

1741
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:18,817
But today you're going to hear
about how he came to be.

1742
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,319
Once upon a time,

1743
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,279
there was a mighty forest,

1744
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:25,824
and in that forest
there was a baby

1745
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:27,617
who was all alone

1746
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:29,994
and needed to find a family
to care for him

1747
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:32,956
and to love him
and be there for him, always.

1748
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:34,874
[***]

1749
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:38,628
And although
there are many more children

1750
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,130
than there used to be,

1751
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:42,132
Santa Claus never complains.

1752
01:04:42,173 --> 01:04:43,508
For, to him,

1753
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,094
there is nothing as beautiful
as a happy child.

1754
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,638
Merry Christmas!

1755
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,056
-[crowd cheers and applauds]
-[crying out] Yes!

1756
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:51,641
Yes!

1757
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:55,478
[cheering continues]

1758
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,272
Let's go, Miles!

1759
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:00,859
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

1760
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,363
Miles!

1761
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,906
Oh! Great job!

1762
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:08,158
Ha!

1763
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:09,492
-Thank you.
-See, Uncle Eddie?

1764
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:11,036
I knew Miles could do it.

1765
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:13,538
Your parents

1766
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,665
are gonna love the footage
your uncle got for you.

1767
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:17,709
Do you have plans
for Christmas brunch?

1768
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,336
I do.

1769
01:05:19,377 --> 01:05:23,131
I'm actually gonna be on a plane
to Honolulu tomorrow afternoon.

1770
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:24,966
You're missing Christmas?

1771
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:26,384
Christmas happens
in Hawaii, Mom.

1772
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,886
I-I know, I know.

1773
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:29,721
I just thought
that it would be nice

1774
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,222
to have the family over,

1775
01:05:31,264 --> 01:05:33,892
since Kathleen and Nate
will likely be very tired

1776
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:36,686
after driving all that way--
and with a tiny baby.

1777
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:39,314
DeVito Christmas brunch
is not to be missed.

1778
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:40,899
The whole family is there.

1779
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,233
All of 'em?

1780
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:44,110
[DeVitos] All of them!

1781
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,695
That is a very generous offer

1782
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:46,821
and I will definitely

1783
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:48,615
pass it along
to Kathleen and Nate,

1784
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:50,033
when they get back.

1785
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:51,493
I vote "yes".

1786
01:05:51,534 --> 01:05:52,535
Sure you do!

1787
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:54,954
[Sam chuckles] Anyway...

1788
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:56,539
we have to get home

1789
01:05:56,581 --> 01:06:01,711
because someone has to help
hang stockings for Santa Claus.

1790
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,047
[Dania] You really
were good tonight, Miles.

1791
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:05,215
You didn't even mess up!

1792
01:06:05,256 --> 01:06:06,883
Thanks, D.

1793
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:09,052
You know your parents would've
been at the play if they could.

1794
01:06:09,094 --> 01:06:09,928
I know.

1795
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,471
Your mom texted

1796
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,932
that they'd stop for the night
to be safe, if they had to.

1797
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:16,059
They can't go too fast
because they have the new baby.

1798
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,352
That's right.

1799
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:19,729
As amazing as you were
tonight, Miles,

1800
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:21,981
you both need to get some sleep

1801
01:06:22,023 --> 01:06:24,734
because tomorrow
is a very special day.

1802
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:27,946
Goodnight!

1803
01:06:27,987 --> 01:06:30,448
Goodnight.

1804
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,117
Good job!

1805
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:40,083
What time
is your flight tomorrow?

1806
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:42,419
Uh, two.

1807
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,671
But I gotta take
the train to JFK,

1808
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:47,716
so I'll probably leave Brayden
around 11.

1809
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:50,010
That's barely time for brunch.

1810
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:52,220
Clearly, I didn't
plan this through.

1811
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:55,849
You know...

1812
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,767
there's something
about a quiet house

1813
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,728
on Christmas Eve...

1814
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:01,771
I used to always love.

1815
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:04,315
It's the anticipation.

1816
01:07:06,484 --> 01:07:08,820
So much is about to happen.

1817
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:16,244
Our family
isn't big on traditions,

1818
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:17,746
but...

1819
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:20,457
one thing that we do
on Christmas Eve

1820
01:07:20,498 --> 01:07:21,750
that I loved,

1821
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:24,711
is we turn off
all the lights in the house,

1822
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:27,005
except for the ones
on the tree.

1823
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:29,299
And then we listen
to "Silent Night"

1824
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,468
and just...

1825
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,595
[takes a deep breath]

1826
01:07:33,636 --> 01:07:36,056
...be present.

[Jason gasps softly]

1836
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,392

[men chuckling]

1841
01:08:39,452 --> 01:08:41,371
They're home.

[***]

1843
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:51,214
Hey, Dad!

1844
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,549
My boy!

1845
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:53,800
Hi!

1846
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:55,343
-Thank you!
-Of course!

1847
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:57,053
That's what big brothers
are for.

1848
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:58,221
[gasping]

1849
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:00,724
Oh... my gosh!

1850
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:01,933
There she is.

1851
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:04,728
So cute! Come on! Come on!

1852
01:09:04,769 --> 01:09:07,439
I always forget
how tiny they are.

1853
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:09,983
Well, she'll probably

1854
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:12,819
be in college by the next time
you come visit, so...

1855
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,154
Oh, I'm impressed...

1856
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,739
you got a dig in,
in the first five minutes.

1857
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,906
Well done.

1858
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:18,575
You know I'm skilled
like that.

1859
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,118
[chuckling]

1860
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,915
What if I...

1861
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:28,501
stayed here for Christmas?

1862
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:30,420
Are you serious?

1863
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:31,921
Only if that's cool with you.

1864
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:32,922
[astonished chuckle]

1865
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:34,716
You know I'm cool with it.

1866
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:37,135
What made you
change your mind?

1867
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:41,348
[***]

1868
01:09:41,389 --> 01:09:44,184
A lot of things.

1869
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:46,269
Jason?

1870
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:49,773
I can't thank you enough.

1871
01:09:49,814 --> 01:09:52,442
You're the best contractor
in the world...

1872
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:53,777
and a great friend.

1873
01:09:53,818 --> 01:09:55,987
Glad to help.

1874
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:57,947
And it was a real education.

1875
01:09:57,989 --> 01:09:59,574
I hope it didn't scare you off
of having kids.

1876
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:01,034
Just the opposite.

1877
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:02,452
Well, you're gonna
be a great dad.

1878
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:04,037
I second that.

1879
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,914
I hope so.

1880
01:10:06,998 --> 01:10:09,125
All right, well,
I am gonna go get her settled

1881
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,710
and...

1882
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,879
I will see you later

1883
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:15,465
and I will talk to you soon.

1884
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,425
Okay, bye.

1885
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,015
I had a lot of fun.

1886
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,393
So did I.

1887
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:29,354
It was nothing like
how I thought it would go.

1888
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,523
It's a really good thing
you had an uncle consultant.

1889
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:33,149
Right?

1890
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:34,693
Right.

1891
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:36,611
Um, I almost forgot
to give you this.

1892
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:40,532
There you go.

1893
01:10:44,035 --> 01:10:45,662
Oh.

1894
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:47,288
It should cover
the retainer fee,

1895
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,707
and then some.

1896
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,209
This is way too generous.

1897
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,961
Well, I couldn't have done it
without you.

1898
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:54,546
I bet you could have...

1899
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:56,006
eventually.

1900
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,258
Hey, Sam?

1901
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:00,051
Could you, uh, uh...

1902
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:02,137
show Frank
to the guest bedroom?

1903
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:05,265
I'm gonna go help settle
the baby with Kathleen.

1904
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:06,266
Yeah, sure.

1905
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:07,892
Okay. Thanks.

1906
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:10,854
So I think I'm gonna take off.

1907
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:14,024
It was nice getting to know you,
Sam Dalton.

1908
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:17,027
That sounds strangely final.

1909
01:11:17,068 --> 01:11:18,278
No.

1910
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:20,739
The deal is done,
and the check is paid.

1911
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,033
As agreed, so...

1912
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:26,578
Merry Christmas.

1913
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,331

[Dania] A unicorn.

-You made it!

We missed you so much.

I'm sorry
we missed your play.

Hey.

1942
01:12:31,893 --> 01:12:33,853
It's okay.
Uncle Sam recorded it.

1943
01:12:33,895 --> 01:12:36,523
He did great.

1944
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:39,693
Uncle Sam helped me a lot.

1945
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:40,902
What's her name?

Well...

1947
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:43,446
We thought, since--

1948
01:12:43,488 --> 01:12:45,031
Well, since
she's a Christmas baby,

1949
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,367
we'd name her
something after the season.

1950

Miles, Dania--

to recover for photos...

1962
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,766
because Uncle Sam is spending
all of Christmas with us.

01:13:11,808 --> 01:13:13,393
Awesome!

01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,867
[***]

1980
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,957
You okay?

1981
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,292
Huh?

1982
01:14:20,502 --> 01:14:22,504
Yeah.

1983
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,174
I'm gonna get
breakfast started.

1984
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:29,511
Does anybody have any requests?

1985
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:32,639
I'd love some pancakes.

1986
01:14:38,728 --> 01:14:41,189
[***]

1987
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:43,858
I'll go.

1988
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:49,197
[***]

1989
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,289
Mm. Tell me about Jason.

1990
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:02,168
I like him, sis.

1991
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:04,504
Like...
I really like him.

1992
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,715
Yeah...

1993
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:09,009
I kinda sensed that.

1994
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,219
But... something went wrong.

1995
01:15:11,261 --> 01:15:13,638
I don't know what.

1996
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,850
He gave me back the check
that I gave him last night.

1997
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:19,227
Why did you give him a check?

1998
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:22,147
It... was part
of our agreement,

1999
01:15:22,188 --> 01:15:24,357
for him helping me.

2000
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,776
I know that he needed it
for his adoption lawyer.

2001
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:28,319
Th-That's why I gave him more,

2002
01:15:28,361 --> 01:15:31,489
so that way,
he'd have plenty to cover it.

2003
01:15:33,241 --> 01:15:35,952
And he's... he's gone so far,

2004
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:38,288
and beyond, helping me.

2005
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:40,665
And you really like him

2006
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:42,625
and wanted to help him
in return?

2007
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:46,671
Did I do something wrong?

2008
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:48,673
I don't think so.

2009
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,092
Maybe...

2010
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:54,095
he originally agreed
to be paid to help you,

2011
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,139
and then things changed...

2012
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,767
and it didn't feel right
taking the money anymore?

2013
01:15:59,976 --> 01:16:01,436
What?

2014
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:07,776
[voice cracks] I'm...

2015
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,611
I'm scared.

2016
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:16,368
I don't know if I can be
what Jason needs.

2017
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,578
And his needs are very clear.

2018
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,288
You don't think
you could ever be open

2019
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,790
to having a family?

2020
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:23,792
It's really hard to explain.

2021
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:25,919
See...

2022
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:27,420
you've known your whole life

2023
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:32,300
that marriage and kids
were at least an option.

2024
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:36,388
[quietly] That hasn't
been my experience.

2025
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,016
Most of the time,
I'm told no.

2026
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,102
Well, not by Mom and Dad.

2027
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:44,187
No. I'm really lucky there.

2028
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:45,605
But legally,

2029
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,483
and perception-wise,
you know,

2030
01:16:48,525 --> 01:16:52,362
I've faced a whole lot of
"Uh-uh. Not you."

2031
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:56,157
And, yeah, it's different...

2032
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,159
to a degree...

2033
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:02,872
but my internal voice
is still catching up.

2034
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:05,333
I think that's why I run

2035
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,961
and never make it
to a second date.

2036
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:12,632
It's...

2037
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:16,428
hard to flip the switch
to "yes".

2038
01:17:16,469 --> 01:17:18,805
Do you think you want to?

2039
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,391
With Jason?

2040
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:24,936
All I know is, for
the first time in my whole life,

2041
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:27,022
I'm thinking "maybe"...

2042
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:31,192
[***]

2043
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,361
I know.

2044
01:17:34,904 --> 01:17:37,365
[***]

2045
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,369
Another year over

2046
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,496
[laughter]

2047
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:46,124
It's another one gone

2048
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:50,462
It's time to reflect upon

2049
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:55,675
All said and done

2050
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:58,386
I'll be missing you
Darling

2051
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,515
This Christmas Day

2052
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:06,770
I wish
I were close to you

2053
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:12,776
But I'm miles away

2054
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:17,906
For me
Christmas is nothing

2055
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:22,035
Without you to hold

2056
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,165
Wow! This looks amazing.

2057
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:28,917
Are you sure
you didn't call a caterer?

2058
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,752
[mockingly] "Are you sure
you didn't call a caterer?"

2059
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:32,337
[snickers]

2060
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:33,922
So, are you
gonna invite Jason?

2061
01:18:33,963 --> 01:18:35,382
Would you look

2062
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:38,677
what my fantasy football league
sent over...

2063
01:18:40,595 --> 01:18:43,056
...to celebrate
baby Angie's first Christmas?

2064
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:44,391
[Kathleen] Hmm.

2065
01:18:44,432 --> 01:18:45,475
We'll, uh...

2066
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:47,102
We'll raise a toast later.

2067
01:18:47,143 --> 01:18:49,145
Mm. [munching]

2068
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:53,566
Why are you staring
at the champagne?

2069
01:18:54,776 --> 01:18:56,945
I'm gonna tell Jason
how I feel.

2070
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:59,489
Amazing.

2071
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:00,865
I'm so proud of you.

2072
01:19:00,907 --> 01:19:01,950
So...

2073
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:03,535
why are you staring
at the champagne?

2074
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:05,620
I told my friend, Ellie,

2075
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:08,415
that big deals
should be celebrated...

2076
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:10,166
and this...

2077
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,460
is a really big deal.

2078
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,923
You're still
in your Christmas pajamas!

2079
01:19:16,965 --> 01:19:18,967
[***]

2080
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:25,724
I like Sam.

2081
01:19:25,765 --> 01:19:28,560
But I need someone
who puts his family first,

2082
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:30,061
not flies to Hawaii
on Christmas.

2083
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,438
Excuse me,

2084
01:19:31,479 --> 01:19:32,897
but from what you told me,
didn't he drop everything

2085
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:34,691
to take care of
his niece and nephew?

2086
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,776
I mean, that's pretty much
the definition

2087
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:38,319
of putting family first,
isn't it?

2088
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:39,696
For a couple of days.

2089
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,823
I need someone
for the long haul, Pete.

2090
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:44,117
Buddy, there's no guarantees
in life.

2091
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,327
How'd you leave it?

2092
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:48,246
Well, he paid me
for our time together,

2093
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,706
and that tells me
what he thinks.

2094
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:51,875
So he followed through on
paying you what you agreed to?

2095
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,668
Felt transactional.

2096
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,628
Because it was a transaction,
not a declaration!

2097
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,630
Look, here's what I know, okay?

2098
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:59,591
Sam is the first guy
in a long time

2099
01:19:59,632 --> 01:20:01,760
to make you look
really happy.

2100
01:20:02,802 --> 01:20:05,305
I suppose I can call him
after Christmas.

2101
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:06,973
Yeah, yeah.

2102
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,142
I mean, unless he meets somebody
while he's away...

2103
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,311
alone in paradise.

2104
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,063
[quickly]
I didn't think about that!

2105
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:14,522
Should I call him now?

2106
01:20:14,564 --> 01:20:16,691
Train station's 10 minutes
away-- go in person.

2107
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,026
Jase?

2108
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,445
Take care of that.

2109
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:23,907
[***]

2110
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:25,658
Go get him!

2111
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,328
I don't know what I'm doing.

2112
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:29,829
You're risking your heart.

2113
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,748
Is it always
this terrifying?

2114
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:34,334
Yep! I hate to tell ya...
but it is.

2115
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:36,503
Ohh. I love you.

2116
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:37,879
[laughs]
I love you, too.

2117
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,673
Mm!

2118
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,257
Now...

2119
01:20:41,299 --> 01:20:43,385
go get your guy.

2120
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:44,719
[shrieks] Go!

2121
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:45,595
Right!

2122
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:47,806
[***]

2123
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:50,475
You know
it's drivin' me crazy

2124
01:20:50,517 --> 01:20:52,852
Just bein' away from you

2125
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:55,689
Ooh!

2126
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:58,066
It's getting colder, baby

2127
01:20:58,108 --> 01:20:59,442
He's at his house!

2128
01:20:59,484 --> 01:21:01,236
I don't want
no winter blues

2129
01:21:01,277 --> 01:21:02,529
Get him!

2130
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:03,863
[***]

2131
01:21:03,905 --> 01:21:05,031
Yeah, I know
we've been here before

2132
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:06,116
[whistles]

2133
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:08,118
Right.

2134
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,370
You've been all alone
When the first snow falls

2135
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:12,539
Guys, he's going to his house!

2136
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:13,873
This time
I'm telling you

2137
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:16,876
I'll be there for Christmas

2138
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:19,045
[***]

2139
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:21,548
Ooh

2140
01:21:21,589 --> 01:21:23,133
Baby, we

2141
01:21:23,174 --> 01:21:24,968
-Whoa!
-Sam?

2142
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:26,469
Hey.

2143
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:27,721
I'm sorry
I gave you that check.

2144
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:28,722
No, I was being
too sensitive.

2145
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:29,556
No.

2146
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:31,307
We had an agreement, but...

2147
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:32,726
things changed.

2148
01:21:32,767 --> 01:21:34,561
Yeah, I don't care
about the agreement.

2149
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:35,895
You're what's important to me

2150
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:37,522
and that's what
I was coming to tell you

2151
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:38,565
before you left for Hawaii.

2152
01:21:38,606 --> 01:21:40,400
I'm not going to Hawaii.

2153
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:42,277
Wonderful state,
can't wait to visit, but...

2154
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:46,322
...what I want is here.

2155
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:48,408
You're what's
important to me, too.

2156
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,744
I-I should've said this
to you last night,

2157
01:21:50,785 --> 01:21:53,705
but seeing you leave--
it threw me off.

2158
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:57,751
Pretending to have
a husband and kids

2159
01:21:57,792 --> 01:22:00,962
and a dog
and even a mini van,

2160
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:04,591
i-it's not something
I ever saw for myself...

2161
01:22:04,632 --> 01:22:07,260
or even thought
that I could have.

2162
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,597
And I--I know we were

2163
01:22:10,638 --> 01:22:13,141
in a kind of
our own little bubble, but...

2164
01:22:14,517 --> 01:22:17,187
[voice cracks]
...I really liked that bubble.

2165
01:22:17,228 --> 01:22:19,147
A lot.

2166
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:21,274
Me too.

2167
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:23,276
It felt right.

2168
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,070
Youfelt right.

2169
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:26,571
You feel right!

2170
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:29,741
More than any other guy
I've ever met in my whole life.

2171
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:31,910
And I can't make "forever"
a guarantee, I know that,

2172
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:33,286
but I think that
there might be a way--

2173
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:35,413
[***]

2174
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:51,554
Do you want to have lunch
with my family for Christmas?

2175
01:22:51,596 --> 01:22:53,723
Yes, I do.

2176
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,518
And then do you want to have
Christmas dinner with mine?

2177
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:59,688
Sounds perfect.

2178
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:01,356
Merry Christmas...

2179
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:03,441
Merry Christmas.

2180
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:08,071
[***]

2181
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:11,157
[family cheering]

2182
01:23:13,827 --> 01:23:17,080
[cheering and applauding]

2183
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,667
Get under the mistletoe

2184
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:22,335
When it starts to snow

2185
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,380
Honey, I'm coming home

2186
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:27,841
This time
I promise you

2187
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:31,302
I'll be there for Christmas

2188
01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:34,055
[***]

2189
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,810
Baby, I'll be there
for Christmas

2190
01:23:44,357 --> 01:23:46,901
[***]
