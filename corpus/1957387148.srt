1
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:47,959
I wish we could just
stay out here all day.

2
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,583
Yeah, me, too.

3
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,125
No such luck.

4
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,959
Well, we'd better
be heading in.

5
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,250
I never should have
given you that watch.

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,417
Clea, you don't know where

7
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,166
that old '50s bowling shirt
of mine is, do you?

8
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,583
Nope. Sorry.

9
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,542
What's cooking?

10
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,375
A Turkey loaf for the picnic.

11
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,500
It's a recipe
from my home ec. Class.

12
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,000
I just hope
I know what I'm doing.

13
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,417
It smells promising.

14
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,333
Don't look at me.

15
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,750
Why? Is something different?

16
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,458
Very funny, dad.

17
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,041
You better start doing
or undoing

18
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,375
whatever you need to
to get ready.

19
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,542
( Horse snorting )

20
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:03,834
Oh, I love you, Zad.

21
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,417
You're such a good horse.

22
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,291
Oh, Luis, we need to drive up
to Eureka Springs tomorrow

23
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,083
pick up that Dutch mare.

24
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,250
Okay. Hey,
that makes six boarders...

25
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,750
It's almost
a full house.

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,667
( Neighing )

27
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,166
Luis:
Ho, ho...

28
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,625
Easy, easy.

29
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,750
Good.

30
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,000
Nora?

31
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,542
You can come on in, Neal.

32
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,875
The horses aren't
going to attack you.

33
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,333
I thought I might wear

34
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,959
that old '50s bowling shirt
this afternoon

35
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,625
with a pair of chinos.

36
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:34,917
What do you think?

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,917
Sounds good.
You'll look great.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,917
Do you know where
the shirt is?

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,208
Your guess is
as good as mine.

40
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,041
How about helping me
look for it?

41
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,125
Sure, when I'm done here.

42
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,917
Neal:
We have to leave
in an hour.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,417
Maybe you should have
thought of it earlier.

44
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,709
I'll look
for it, dad.

45
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,917
You don't need
to do that, Simon.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,166
It's no problem.

47
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,250
We could probably
get this into a ducktail

48
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,375
if you really want
to go the distance.

49
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,750
Neal:
Sure. Clea's
going for broke.

50
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:03,834
Why not me?

51
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:04,792
Cool.

52
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,750
Are you sure you don't want
to ride in the parade

53
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,291
with us this year, Nora?

54
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,458
I'm positive,
but I admire your persistence.

55
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,250
I won't ask again.

56
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,250
Oh, yes, you will.

57
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,417
Luis, did you check
on Perseus' leg?

58
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,959
Yeah, we should wrap it.

59
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,291
Nora:
Let's do that now.

60
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,625
I'll get the liniment.

61
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,000
Luis:
I don't think we
have enough gauze.

62
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:34,792
Whoa!

63
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,542
Don't say anything.

64
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,083
I feel ridiculous enough.

65
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,375
No.

66
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,625
If I was visiting
from another planet

67
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,625
I'd probably think
you were very hot.

68
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,041
Oh, well, I'm sure you
mean that as a compliment.

69
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,333
Well, of course.

70
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,125
How was your ride?

71
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,375
Oh, it was great.

72
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,083
How come you never
take me riding?

73
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,083
We'll go tomorrow.

74
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,083
Really?

75
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,166
Sure.

76
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, it's t-minus-50.

77
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,333
Let's hop to it.

78
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,792
Yes, sir.

79
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,333
Are you on schedule?

80
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:07,792
I'm t-minus-80.

81
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,291
Too bad.
You'll have to go like that.

82
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,333
( Gasping ):
I'm on schedule.

83
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,709
I'm on schedule.

84
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,041
( Drumming )

85
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,417
( Band playing
"stars and stripes forever")

86
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,041
( Honking )

87
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,917
Here they come.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,125
Here they come.

89
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,375
Nora:
Your dad's
in hog heaven.

90
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,834
Look at him.

91
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,667
( Nora laughing )

92
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,500
( Jazzy bluegrass playing )

93
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,583
...kicking and screaming
into the 21st century.

94
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,500
We are the only
insurance company

95
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,083
without an
email address.

96
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,375
Now, wait a minute.

97
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,583
I am this close to being
computer literate.

98
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,083
Clea's giving me lessons.

99
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,041
I surf the web.

100
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,250
The net. You surf the net.

101
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,667
I've been
threatening
to quit

102
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,166
unless Neal
starts pulling

103
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,583
his weight at the office.

104
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,583
Don't get
your hopes up.

105
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,917
He still can't
program our VCR.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,709
A few more years,
I'll have it nailed.

107
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,458
I don't want anything to do
with any of it.

108
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,208
This Turkey loaf is world-class.

109
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,375
Clea is gonna be happy.

110
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,417
She's been working
on it since dawn.

111
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,417
Where is she?

112
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,542
I'll give her
my review.

113
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,375
She went to talk
to her boyfriend.

114
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,667
Boyfriend?

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,125
You let that child
have a boyfriend?

116
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,458
She's 15, oz.

117
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,250
It seems like
yesterday

118
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,709
you were 15.

119
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,208
Your mom would come by
and carp about all the boys

120
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,625
you were seeing.

121
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,709
It's me you're talking
about there, Iris.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,875
Iris:
Somebody get me
out of this.

123
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,250
It's okay; Nora never listened
to her mother about the boys.

124
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,417
I was just being consistent.

125
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,792
I never listened to my mother
about anything.

126
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,792
Hey, you looked very
cool out there today.

127
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,208
Not too dorky?

128
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,709
No, cool.

129
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:33,208
Oh... well, then, maybe
I'll keep my hair like this.

130
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,166
Don't push it.

131
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,125
So, who wants cherry pie
and homemade ice cream?

132
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,291
Pile it on.

133
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,667
Nora?

134
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
I couldn't, Iris, thanks.

135
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,333
Neal?

136
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,542
Absolutely.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,291
Uh...

138
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,542
On second thought,
I better pass.

139
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,291
Oh, come on,
one little piece?

140
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,792
I'd hear about it later.

141
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,083
Poor Neal, he's so abused.

142
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,333
Simon.

143
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,667
Just in time
for pie a la mode.

144
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, sounds good, Iris.

145
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,125
Woman:
This crust is
out of this world.

146
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,208
What's your secret?
She could
tell you,

147
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,375
but then she'd have to kill you.

148
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,834
Iris:
I use crushed
almonds.

149
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,250
Come on, Nora,
let's go make the rounds...

150
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,291
Do a little P.R.

151
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,792
Hey, mom, let's dance.

152
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,709
What?

153
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,583
Come on, dance with me.

154
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,792
( Laughing )

155
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,959
Okay.

156
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,750
How about sneaking a
little piece of pie now?

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, with a big scoop
of ice cream.

158
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,000
Having fun, George?

159
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,500
I always have fun.

160
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,000
Is, uh, Nora here?

161
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,083
Right over there.

162
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,500
Mr. Wetzel, Mrs. Wetzel,
how are you doing?

163
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,583
Neal.

164
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,625
I'm about to burst.

165
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,375
You got a policy for that?

166
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,959
Sounds like I'm too late.

167
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,959
I'm not too late
for hail season though.

168
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:34,083
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Kramer.

169
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,333
Good afternoon, Neal.

170
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,208
I hear you're retiring
next spring.

171
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,625
You looking
forward to it?

172
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,125
Oh, I'll miss
my students.

173
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,375
I'm sure Simon
is wishing

174
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,917
that I'd retired
last year.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh, no, now...

176
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,667
But there really
is no reason

177
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,959
for him to have failed
that first exam.

178
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,959
As I wrote in the note
that I sent home with him

179
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,917
Simon is a very
bright boy.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,333
He's just not applying himself.

181
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,500
Right.

182
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:03,291
Right. Well...
I'm sure he'll shape up.

183
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,041
I know he will.

184
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,000
I want to talk to you, Simon.

185
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,417
I ran into
Mrs. Kramer.

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,709
Explain yourself,
Simon.

187
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,959
Ah, I'm sorry, dad

188
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,667
but trigonometry's
just really hard.

189
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,834
I'm not talking about
your grades, Simon

190
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,875
although I'm very unhappy
about that.

191
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm talking about the note

192
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,834
Mrs. Kramer sent
home with you.

193
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,417
The note to your
mother and me.

194
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,792
You just
threw it away?

195
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,917
You didn't think
we'd find out? How long

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,959
did you think
you could keep it from us?

197
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,625
I knew about the note, Neal.

198
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,834
Simon gave
it to me.

199
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,792
He's promised
to work harder.

200
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,834
He's got the rest of the
semester to catch up.

201
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,959
And all of this
was to be kept from me?

202
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,875
No, I just thought
you'd get upset

203
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,959
and make too much of it,
so, I didn't say anything.

204
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,875
Dad, dad, don't be mad at mom.

205
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,542
This whole thing's my fault.

206
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,208
I'm the one who's flunking trig.

207
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,458
Simon, you don't need
to keep running interference

208
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:27,667
for your mother, okay?

209
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,458
And as for you...

210
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,625
I'm not angry.

211
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,375
I'm just disappointed.

212
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,000
I expect you to
make up for it.

213
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,917
There will be studying
in this house every day.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,750
Riding will be confined
to the weekends

215
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,542
and if your grades
aren't up to snuff

216
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,083
there will be no riding at all.

217
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,417
Am I clear?

218
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,083
Yes, sir.

219
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,458
( Sighing )

220
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,875
( Sighing )

221
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,125
Neal?

222
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,041
I'm sorry I didn't
show you the note.

223
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,333
I know I spoil Simon.

224
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,583
I'm sorry I wasn't by
your side this afternoon.

225
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,333
I know you
wanted me to be.

226
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,250
It's just that all
that embarrasses me.

227
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,250
Maybe I'll be
braver next year

228
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,250
if you still want me.

229
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,083
( Sighing )

230
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,208
You know,
if someone could explain

231
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,417
the point of trig to me,
maybe I could get into it.

232
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,792
Well, once you pass,

233
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,750
you'll never even have
to think about it again.

234
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,792
Trigonometry doesn't
exist in the real world.

235
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,875
Really?

236
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,500
You know,
that's enough.

237
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,709
Let's go
for a ride.

238
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,250
Oh, I can't.

239
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,000
Dad grounded me.

240
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,375
I promised him
I'd study.

241
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,709
But you promised me
we'd go riding.

242
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,875
That was before I got busted.

243
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,667
So, why can't you do both?

244
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,417
Easy, easy,
easy, easy.

245
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,792
There you go.

246
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,875
( Nickering )

247
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:04,917
Hey, slow down.

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,041
You'll spook
the new horse.

249
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,125
You wouldn't really mind

250
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,667
if we went for a ride,
would you?

251
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,250
( Sighing )

252
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,750
Did you get your homework done?

253
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:13,875
Yes, he did.

254
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,125
We both did.

255
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,083
Almost.

256
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,792
"Almost" means
you didn't, Simon.

257
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,041
Simon:
"Almost" means almost.

258
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,166
We won't be out long.

259
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,417
We can finish
when we get back.

260
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Please, mom?
It's such a
beautiful day.

261
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,375
All right. Half an hour, okay?

262
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,834
Deal.

263
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:31,333
Oh, can I, can I ride Zad?

264
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,917
Sure.

265
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,959
Half an hour means half an hour.

266
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,375
No "almosts."

267
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,125
Clea, you're an idiot!

268
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,291
Loser!

269
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,667
Loser, huh?

270
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,125
Look, no feet!

271
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,333
( Grunting )

272
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,750
Simon.

273
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,500
Simon, I know you're going
to leap up and scare me.

274
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,667
This isn't funny.

275
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,041
Simon?

276
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,041
Simon?

277
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,542
Simon.

278
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,458
Such a sweet horse.

279
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:29,959
We've heard a lot of
good things about you.

280
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,041
( Both chuckling softly )

281
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,166
Clea:
Mom! Mom!

282
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,083
What happened?

283
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,834
Zad threw Simon.

284
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,083
Where is he?

285
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,667
At the bend
in the river.

286
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,917
Get help.

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,291
Are you okay?

288
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,417
Yeah.

289
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,959
Simon?

290
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,542
Simon!

291
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,542
( Panting )

292
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,375
Simon. Oh, my baby!

293
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,750
Oh, god, no!

294
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,625
Oh, god, no! Simon!

295
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh! Simon!

296
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,041
Simon! My baby!

297
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh, my baby!

298
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,375
( Sobbing hysterically )

299
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,834
( Sobbing ):
My baby...

300
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,125
My baby.

301
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,250
Clea?

302
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
What's wrong, honey?

303
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,750
No, no. Slow down.

304
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,792
I can't understand...

305
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,041
Something's
happened to Simon.

306
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,250
Clea, what is it?

307
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,875
Nora...

308
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,083
How did it happen?

309
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,959
Zad never bucks...

310
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,750
Never gets spooked.

311
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,083
I don't know.

312
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,208
I don't know anything
about horses.

313
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,625
I've always been afraid
of their riding.

314
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:27,000
You're saying what
happened is my fault?

315
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,500
Of course not.

316
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,458
Nora, please, please.

317
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,583
It's not
a question
of blame.

318
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,500
Oh, I see.

319
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,375
You're letting me
off the hook.

320
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,041
Nora, please,
don't do this.

321
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,083
( Sighing )

322
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,625
Can I help?

323
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
( Knocking )

324
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,041
( Door opening )

325
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,834
You sleeping?

326
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,500
No.

327
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,792
I kind of figured
you weren't.

328
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,750
You feel
like talking?

329
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,542
No.

330
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,834
Well...

331
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,709
We just have
to get through this.

332
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,834
We have to.

333
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,750
( Sighing )

334
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,750
( Crying ):
Get through it.

335
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,667
We'll find a way
to get through it.

336
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:31,083
( Nickering )

337
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,083
( Crying )

338
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,125
Go!

339
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,041
( Gunshot )

340
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:31,709
Dad?

341
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:33,458
Stay here.

342
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,083
I heard a shot!

343
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,834
Zad's gone.

344
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,083
Nora?!

345
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,834
Mrs. Mahler!

346
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,041
Nora?!

347
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,667
( Crying )

348
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,083
Nora...

349
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,417
Give me the gun.

350
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
No. No, let me.

351
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,959
Let me have the gun.

352
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:35,959
Let me!

353
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,166
Let me have the gun.
I want to die!

354
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,500
Give me the gun!

355
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,917
Let me!
I want to die!

356
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,083
( Sobbing )

357
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,083
( Sobbing continues )

358
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,083
( Sobbing continues )

359
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,375
Woman:
We've given your wife
a strong sedative.

360
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,041
It's just taking effect.

361
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:26,041
She'll sleep the better
part of tomorrow.

362
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,000
I'd like to keep her
under observation

363
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,250
for a couple of days.

364
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,375
She's in no shape
to leave here

365
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,041
and I think it
would be unwise

366
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,333
for her to attend
your son's funeral.

367
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,667
She'd never forgive me.

368
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,083
Then, you might
want to postpone it

369
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,125
a few days.

370
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,458
When she's
ready to leave

371
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,125
I'll give her
an anti-depressant

372
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,166
to help her
get through
the days ahead.

373
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,709
( Sighing )

374
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:53,709
What about the years ahead, Tom?

375
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,750
I think there's maybe
no heartache greater

376
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,625
than outliving
your own child.

377
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:03,917
You don't ever
recover from it.

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,500
You just learn
how to endure it.

379
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,417
Neal, if it's any comfort

380
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,041
Simon's death
was instantaneous.

381
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,792
He didn't suffer.

382
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,208
Well, then, I guess
he'll be the only one.

383
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,208
( Rooster crowing )

384
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,709
( Ignition bell dinging )

385
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,417
Luis...

386
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,000
( Whinnying )

387
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,834
The horse come back?

388
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,583
Oh, not yet,
but she will.

389
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,959
I don't want it here
when Nora gets home.

390
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,709
If it comes back,
take it to the auctioneer.

391
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:48,250
W-W... sell zad?

392
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,333
Nora doesn't want to see
that horse again, ever.

393
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:52,208
Are you sure...?

394
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,291
Just do it.

395
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,333
( Horse nickering )

396
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,875
Mrs. Rhymer...

397
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:26,959
Hmm?

398
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,542
There's a call for you.

399
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,875
Oh.

400
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,875
Thanks.

401
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,000
Hello?

402
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,083
No more.

403
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,417
If you don't eat, they
won't let you go home.

404
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,125
I just want to sleep.

405
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,125
All right.

406
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,333
Oh, excuse me.

407
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,375
( Softly moans )

408
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,375
Do you know this is

409
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,792
the same room you had

410
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,250
when they took
out your tonsils?

411
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,000
Mama?

412
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,083
You're not dreaming, baby.

413
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,667
I'm really here.

414
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,417
Oh, mama.

415
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,458
Simon's dead.

416
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,750
I know.

417
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,750
I know, honey.

418
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,083
( Crying )

419
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,125
( Sighs )

420
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:53,250
Want to go to your house...
Unload your stuff?

421
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,583
Climb over two months'
worth of junk mail?

422
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,125
I can wait, thanks.

423
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,417
Sorry I didn't
bring you anything

424
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,792
from new Mexico.

425
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,917
I thought I was going
to be there a while longer.

426
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,458
It's okay, grandma.

427
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:24,291
I can't get it
to register...

428
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,542
In-in my head.

429
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,625
Maybe because
I wasn't here, but...

430
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,709
I just can't accept
the fact that Simon

431
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:35,041
has suddenly
ceased to exist.

432
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:39,125
How's clea taking it?

433
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,500
She's said maybe
ten words to me
since I came.

434
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,000
That's eight more
than she's said to me.

435
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,667
I think she's still in shock.

436
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,166
I don't know what
to say to her.

437
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,834
I want to be incredibly
strong and reassuring,

438
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,917
but when I try,
nothing much comes out.

439
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh, good grief.

440
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:07,166
From friends and neighbors.

441
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,166
Couldn't they have
spread it out a little bit?

442
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,792
Like over the next five years?

443
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,959
( Phone rings )

444
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:17,667
Hello.

445
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,375
Oh. Sure.

446
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,667
Okay.

447
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,625
Well, I'll pick
something out.

448
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,500
Does it have to be a suit?

449
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:29,792
Simon hates...

450
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,291
Suits.

451
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,166
Look...

452
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,709
I'll pick
something out, okay?

453
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,625
Bye.

454
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,709
I could use Nora
to help with this.

455
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:46,458
Well, Nora didn't
put herself

456
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,875
in the hospital,
doped up and tied to a bed.

457
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,709
She went crazy, Maggie.

458
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,750
You can't believe...

459
00:30:54,834 --> 00:30:56,333
( Sighs )

460
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:57,875
Well...

461
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,542
You weren't here.

462
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,166
I'm sorry.

463
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,333
I don't mean to be
second-guessing

464
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,041
you and the doctors.

465
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,625
Well, maybe I am.

466
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,875
But don't you think Nora would
come out of this a lot faster

467
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,875
if she were home here,
with her family?

468
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,250
I don't know.

469
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,917
I don't know how to
pull Nora out of this.

470
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,041
Nora always decides
what's best for Nora.

471
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,792
And that's reason
to abandon her now?

472
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,959
Come on, Maggie.
I haven't abandoned her.

473
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,583
You haven't exactly taken charge
of her, have you?

474
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,333
That's an interesting
criticism coming
from someone

475
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,208
who allowed her daughter
to be raised by a grandmother.

476
00:31:33,834 --> 00:31:35,291
Nora demanded to live here

477
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,125
with my mother and the horses.

478
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,208
You don't think I'd rather
have had her with me?!

479
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,458
I was out of line.

480
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,583
I'm sorry.

481
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,166
We need to be
allies in this.

482
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,125
Apology accepted.

483
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,500
This might be chicken,
but I wouldn't swear to it.

484
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,500
It's fine.

485
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,458
Whatever.

486
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,041
( Sighs )

487
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,041
You can second-guess the doctors
if you want to, Maggie

488
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,917
but I'm putting
my faith in them.

489
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,583
I don't pretend to know better.

490
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:29,625
( Moaning )

491
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,709
Hello, sleepyhead.

492
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,458
How you feeling?

493
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,500
( Moaning )

494
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,792
Don't want to...

495
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,834
You don't want
what, sweetie?

496
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:49,417
You can't make me...

497
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,041
Make you what?

498
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,166
It's no use.

499
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,000
What's no use, Nora?

500
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,208
To go on.

501
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,166
This can't be right.

502
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,125
I'm busting you out of here.

503
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:28,709
There.

504
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,542
I'll take it
up to her.

505
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,125
Wait a minute.

506
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,667
Okay, now go.

507
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,291
( Sighs )

508
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,291
Room service.

509
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,291
I don't want anything.

510
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:09,375
Too late... it's here.

511
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:13,625
Don't be cheerful, Neal.

512
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,583
I can't stand it.

513
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,792
Did you take
your medication?

514
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,250
Yes...

515
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,917
But it didn't
bring Simon back.

516
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,667
It's not going
to do that, honey.

517
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,750
Then how is it going
to make me feel better?

518
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,750
Nothing is going
to bring Simon back.

519
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:01,625
We have to find a way
to go on without him.

520
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,875
What if we can't?

521
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:18,959
Nora, there are things
that have to be done...

522
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,166
Today.

523
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,875
We have to decide what
Simon's going to wear.

524
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,750
I have to go to sleep.

525
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:32,041
I have to go
to sleep now.

526
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,959
I can't do this alone.

527
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,542
I have to sleep now, Neal.

528
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,834
( Sobbing )

529
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,041
Luis...

530
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,709
Do you think
zad will come back?

531
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,458
She did come back...

532
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:49,750
Yesterday.

533
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,000
I took her
to be sold.

534
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,166
She'll be all right.

535
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,917
She'll get
a new home.

536
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,208
Your dad thought it would
be best for your mom.

537
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,041
I guess maybe
he's right.

538
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,083
Mom loves zad.

539
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,917
She loved Simon more...

540
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,625
And zad killed Simon.

541
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:48,083
( Quiet conversations )

542
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,792
( Woman laughing loudly )

543
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,125
Oh...!

544
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:15,583
( Conversations grow louder )

545
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,959
Excuse me.

546
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,834
Let's leave them alone.

547
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,917
It's my fault.

548
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,125
You won't say it
because you're afraid to,

549
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,417
but we both know
it's my fault.

550
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,709
It's not your fault.

551
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,041
Yes, it is.

552
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,250
I taught him to ride.

553
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,917
Maybe not well enough.

554
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,959
I didn't always make him
wear his helmet.

555
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,959
( Sniffling )

556
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:23,625
I let him out that day
against your wishes.

557
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,625
If it's not my fault,
whose fault is it?

558
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:26,792
It's no one's fault.

559
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,083
I don't want
to live here anymore.

560
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:33,083
You don't really mean that.

561
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,417
I don't want
to see this place

562
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,792
as long as I live.

563
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:57,041
( Sobbing )

564
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,083
I want to sell the farm

565
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,834
and the horses.

566
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,250
We can return the boarders
to their owners

567
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,750
and help Luis
find another job.

568
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,917
Nora...

569
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,291
Don't you think

570
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:31,542
maybe this is
the medication talking?

571
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,166
I'm not on the medication.

572
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,458
I didn't take it.

573
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:36,583
I wanted...

574
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,166
( Sighing )

575
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,458
To remember today.

576
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,291
I wanted to be clear.

577
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,333
I'm clear.

578
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:58,375
Maybe it is a good idea.

579
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,542
You know...

580
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,875
Leave here
for a while.

581
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,125
Move into town

582
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,667
till Nora feels better.

583
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,125
I don't have
a cold, Neal.

584
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,375
I lost my son.

585
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:11,125
I am not going to feel better.

586
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:13,542
I lost my son,
too, Nora.

587
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,208
Clea lost her brother.

588
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,375
Maggie lost her...

589
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,375
It's not the same.

590
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,125
I was in labor...

591
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,041
For 48 hours.

592
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,625
Simon almost died.

593
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,500
I almost died.

594
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:30,083
We have a bond.

595
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,083
It's ours.

596
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,959
We had a bond.

597
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,959
I think you
should leave here

598
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:53,959
for a while.

599
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,291
The three of you
move into my house,

600
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,709
and I'll come out here

601
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,709
and take care
of the farm

602
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,417
till we're all ready
to switch back.

603
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,959
Is that all right
with you, clea?

604
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,458
I don't have to ask if
it's all right with you.

605
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,000
You've never
liked this place.

606
00:43:13,667 --> 00:43:16,125
Never less than now.

607
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:33,709
You'll have more privacy
than you've ever had.

608
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:35,625
You'll be a whole floor
away from us.

609
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:37,000
That's fine.

610
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,375
Clea, I was thinking...

611
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,709
Fran is really
overworked.

612
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:48,000
How would you like
an after-school job

613
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,208
in my office
at a fair wage?

614
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,583
I'd like it a lot, dad.

615
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:55,333
Good.

616
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,291
Here, let me
take that up.

617
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:13,709
Neal?

618
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:16,709
I think I'll stay
in my old room for a while.

619
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,041
Your grandparents built this
farm up from nothing, Maggie.

620
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:34,709
Now, you just can't
throw it away like
last week's garbage.

621
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,667
My mother didn't
leave the farm to me.

622
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,208
She left it to Nora, and
this is what she wants.

623
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,458
Well, selling the farm

624
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:41,542
won't help.

625
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:42,834
She loves it here.

626
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,542
Can't you make her see that?

627
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:47,208
I've never had much influence
on Nora.

628
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,709
No one ever has,
except my mother... and Simon.

629
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:51,959
Her owners found

630
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:54,083
another stable
that will take her.

631
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,500
Only three more
boarders left.

632
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,875
Don't get rid
of Nora's horses.

633
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:02,417
Just go ahead and put
them over in my barn.

634
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,000
They'll be there for her

635
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,458
when she comes back
to her senses.

636
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:07,500
Okay.

637
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:08,667
Oz:
Hey, Louie.

638
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,709
I could use
an extra hand

639
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,041
over at my place.

640
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,750
Have you ever milked a cow?

641
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:16,208
Well, how hard could it be?

642
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,542
Well...

643
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,500
Why don't you
just come on over

644
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,291
and find out?

645
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,291
Thanks.

646
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,250
( School bell ringing )

647
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,000
It's so weird, Justin.

648
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:36,417
I spend all day with kids
and teachers who knew Simon

649
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,000
but no one
even mentions him.

650
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,291
People just don't
know what to say.

651
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,583
His friends are all
probably hating me

652
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,458
because I'm still alive
and he's dead.

653
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,750
Clea, you sound
like a nut

654
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:48,041
when you talk like that.

655
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,750
I don't want to hear it.

656
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:50,959
I mean it.

657
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:53,500
How come you never
let me talk about it?

658
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,000
'Cause it's a bummer.

659
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,750
Look, I'm really sorry
that Simon's dead

660
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,250
but no one's to blame

661
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,750
except for the horse
that threw him.

662
00:46:01,834 --> 00:46:02,834
I'm sorry.

663
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:04,709
I know it's not
your problem.

664
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,083
Don't say that.

665
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,041
Hey.

666
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,625
I'll pick you up
after work

667
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:10,583
and we'll go do
something fun.

668
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,041
Whatever you want.

669
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,166
Okay?

670
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,333
Okay?

671
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:17,625
All right.

672
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:19,250
Fran:
You won't volunteer

673
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,625
so I'll ask.

674
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,750
How are things at home?

675
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,375
The move into town
hasn't helped.

676
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:26,583
If anything,
she's worse.

677
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,458
I don't know how
to take care of her.

678
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:30,000
Who's taking care of you?

679
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,000
I can't worry
about me right now.

680
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,500
I have too much else
on my mind.

681
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,500
Look, I shouldn't be

682
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,125
saying this,
but that's never stopped me.

683
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,500
You're on your own

684
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,125
in the best of times.

685
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:45,834
Nora is never there for you.

686
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:48,500
She always just thinks
of herself.

687
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,166
No.

688
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,166
There's another Nora
that you don't really know...

689
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:55,208
The Nora I fell in love with.

690
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,125
Where's she been
all these years?

691
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:02,917
Oh, she's still there, Fran...
Somewhere.

692
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,291
That's what keeps me
in the game.

693
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:06,959
( Door opening )

694
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,375
Fran:
Hey, pumpkin.

695
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,500
Hey, Fran.

696
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:10,542
Hey, dad.

697
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:11,917
Neal:
Hi.

698
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,333
You have gotten things
so organized around here

699
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:17,583
I actually had time to go
and get my nails done.

700
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,917
Ooh, nice.

701
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,166
There you are.

702
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:34,834
Clea's with Justin.

703
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:37,041
We're on our own.

704
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,875
I stopped by Castelli's
and picked up some dinner.

705
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,166
You want to eat now

706
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,875
or should I keep it warm
in the oven?

707
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:45,500
I don't care.

708
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,250
Whatever you want.

709
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:50,917
What I want, Nora

710
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,458
is for you to come back
to the world.

711
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:55,667
Our world.

712
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,667
Our world had Simon in it.

713
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,542
It doesn't exist anymore.

714
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:13,458
Well, maybe what we need
to do is make a new start.

715
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:19,750
A couple of months ago

716
00:48:19,834 --> 00:48:21,917
I got a feeler
from the home office

717
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,875
asking me if I’d
be interested

718
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:26,583
in the job of regional
manager in Seattle.

719
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:27,750
I said no.

720
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:29,709
I knew there was no way

721
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:32,041
you'd ever leave
the farm.

722
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:35,041
Today I found out
the job is still open.

723
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:37,625
Everything
would be different.

724
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,333
A new city, a new home.

725
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,041
A new beginning.

726
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,250
Take it.

727
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,291
We don't have to decide
right this second.

728
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:57,917
It's a good job,
isn't it?

729
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,792
I don't want to do
anything you'd regret.

730
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,417
It's fine, Neal.

731
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,208
Take it.

732
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,208
You really mean that?

733
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:18,542
( Thunder crashing )

734
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,333
Woman:
I can give you a reason
for every dollar he's got.

735
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,834
Do you know he tried to
drive us out of our home

736
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,250
because he doesn't
like music?

737
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,000
That's sort of a
stinker, isn't it?

738
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,291
Woman: And how.
Believe me, the name of haskell

739
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,375
is pure poison around here.

740
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,709
Man:
Hmmm.

741
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,500
( Thunder crashing )

742
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:54,250
Luis:
Oz...! Iris...!

743
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,083
Fire!

744
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:14,375
( Ringing )

745
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:18,500
Hello?

746
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,083
Okay, Maggie,
I'll be right there.

747
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,917
What is it, Neal?

748
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,834
Fire at oz and Iris'.

749
00:50:25,917 --> 00:50:26,750
I'm coming with you.

750
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:29,625
I'm coming, too.

751
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,709
I called the fire trucks.

752
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:36,959
Where are they?

753
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,750
Well, they'd better
get here quick.

754
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,542
Louie, get back.

755
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:49,625
We got to get the
animals out of there.

756
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,250
( Background chatter )

757
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:28,917
( Whinnying )

758
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,208
Let's take them to our barn.

759
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:41,542
( Glass breaking )

760
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,875
Iris:
Could have been
worse, I guess.

761
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:02,750
That's the way you have
to look at these things.

762
00:52:02,834 --> 00:52:04,625
It could have been worse.

763
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:07,959
Iris, remember that
big fire when we were kids?

764
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,750
Wiped out half the farms

765
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:11,625
this side
of highway 96.

766
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,125
Burnt all your crops

767
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:15,458
and then stopped just
before it got to the house.

768
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:19,458
Yep. My mother
refused to leave.

769
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:21,917
She stood her ground
with this big garden hose

770
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,333
looking the fire in the eye

771
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,667
and just daring it
to mess with grace Hammond.

772
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,875
( Chuckles )

773
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:28,125
She was a
brave lady.

774
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:30,166
Oh, she was just
a stubborn one.

775
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,333
Woman:
Iris?

776
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,583
Oh, now what are
you two doing here?

777
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,583
You both have to be
at work in the morning.

778
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,417
Oh, don't you
worry about that.

779
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:40,667
I told them

780
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,667
you saw lightning
hit the toolshed.

781
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,291
That's right,
followed by flames.

782
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,041
It was definitely caused
by lightning.

783
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,208
Mm-hmm.

784
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:53,333
Well, we'll regroup in the
morning, assess the damage.

785
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,667
I'm sure glad
you're here.

786
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,125
So am I.

787
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,083
Nora and clea
haven't come
back yet?

788
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,625
Mmm, not yet.

789
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:04,917
You're safe now.

790
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,333
Is everything okay?

791
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,250
Yeah. Could you
get him some hay?

792
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,959
Yeah, sure.

793
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,500
You're so
beautiful.

794
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,375
It's okay,
it's all right.

795
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,041
See? It's all right.

796
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,875
No reason to be scared.

797
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:19,375
Come on, boy, it's okay.

798
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,375
I want to talk to you
about something...

799
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,333
And I want an honest
answer, okay?

800
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:31,417
It's nothing bad.

801
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,000
I hope.

802
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,250
There's a chance...

803
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,875
And I don't know how
real it is right now

804
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:38,375
but it's a chance...

805
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:42,208
That I might get offered a job,
a good job, in Seattle.

806
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:45,250
Your mother's
in favor of it

807
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,083
but I wouldn't do it
against your will.

808
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,166
You'd leave mom and me?

809
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,208
No, we'd all go.

810
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,583
The idea is to make
a fresh start...

811
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:57,291
Leave the bad
stuff behind us.

812
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,458
I think it would be
good for your mother.

813
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:04,875
For you, it would
mean leaving Justin

814
00:54:04,959 --> 00:54:06,333
and your friends...

815
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,250
Your grandmother.

816
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:11,417
Of course, she spends
half her time traveling.

817
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,792
She could just work Seattle
into her schedule.

818
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:20,417
Can I let you know?

819
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:22,792
Of course.

820
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:26,333
It's a lot to think
about, I know.

821
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,417
( Humming tune )

822
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,417
( Vehicle approaching )

823
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,875
Hey, Perseus...
You sweet old guy.

824
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:07,041
You got pretty scared
last night, didn't you?

825
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:13,959
Good boy.

826
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,625
( Nora sighing )

827
00:55:18,709 --> 00:55:20,083
Oh, zad.

828
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,917
Shane gorman said that he saw

829
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,709
you and Alyson blubbering
in the hall before school.

830
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,333
"Blubbering"?

831
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,667
Was that his word or yours?

832
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,750
I don't know.
What's the matter?

833
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:55,250
Well, it better be
his word, that's all.

834
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,542
Oh. Okay, it
was his word.

835
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,875
Justin, have you ever
suffered a loss?

836
00:55:59,959 --> 00:56:02,917
And I'm not just talking
about your CD collection

837
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,875
which you stupidly
left in an unlocked car.

838
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:06,875
Wait a second.

839
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,417
Are there suddenly two
classes of people here?

840
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,208
Those who have
lost a loved one

841
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,667
and those
who haven't?
Maybe.

842
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,208
Look, clea, how long
is this going to go on?

843
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,959
I can deal with
it for a while

844
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,166
'cause I care about you

845
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,667
but I can't spend the rest
of my high school days

846
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,917
weighed down by
a lot of drama.

847
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,834
Justin, if you had ever
given me a ring or anything

848
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:28,583
I would be throwing it
in your face right now.

849
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,208
Don't you want me
to walk you to work?

850
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:34,375
I'd rather crawl there over
broken glass than go with you.

851
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,959
You see what I'm talking about?
All this drama.

852
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,750
( Sighs )

853
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:46,709
If I did go, I wouldn't
leave you high and dry.

854
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:49,333
I've been grooming you
to be an agent, anyway.

855
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:50,917
We'll just speed it up.

856
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,667
Get you licensed and ready
to take over the agency.

857
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,667
Nora's actually going
along with this?

858
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,166
Absolutely. She
can't function here.

859
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,125
Moving away
is the best solution.

860
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,792
Leaving behind all the reminders
of what happened.

861
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:07,041
I'm not trying
to sound like a therapist,

862
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:11,000
but... have you given
any thought to staying here

863
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,542
and dealing with it?

864
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,959
It's easy
to say things like that.

865
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:18,333
Try living it, Fran.

866
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:21,208
That's my point... try living it.

867
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,834
The pain is
going to Seattle

868
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:25,583
right along with the
rest of the baggage.

869
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:28,041
Your running away is no way...

870
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,083
Take the new job, dad.

871
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:40,083
I called about the job.

872
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:44,000
They're going to fly
me up to Seattle
to meet the staff.

873
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,166
When do you go?

874
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,625
End of the week.

875
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:49,041
They're treating it
almost as a formality.

876
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:52,458
I'd say the job is mine,
assuming we come to terms.

877
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:53,834
That's exciting, Neal.

878
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,625
Isn't that exciting, clea?

879
00:57:55,709 --> 00:57:57,041
I'm excited.

880
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,834
This is going to be good...
For all of us.

881
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:15,542
Man:
Hi, Neal.

882
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,834
Hi, Dennis.

883
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:17,959
Good to see you.

884
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,583
You, too.

885
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,917
I've got a couple of people
I'd like you to meet.

886
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,834
Okay.

887
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,333
This is, uh,
pat Patterson.

888
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,291
Neal Mahler.

889
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,542
Hi. How are you?

890
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,709
And this is
Lynn Davis.

891
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,291
Nice to meet you.

892
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,750
By the time I get rid of all
the junk I've been hoarding

893
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:41,583
I can probably move to
Seattle with a backpack.

894
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:42,917
Well, don't throw those out.

895
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,917
I want to go through them
all again.

896
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,291
( Sighs )

897
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,083
Will I ever be able
to look at him

898
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:12,166
without feeling
a knife in my heart?

899
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,667
I don't know.

900
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:21,250
Probably not.

901
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,375
Well, couldn't you just say yes?

902
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:27,792
That's what mothers are for...
Give maternal reassurance.

903
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,667
Like you do with clea?

904
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,583
I'm very maternal with clea.

905
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:34,750
She just doesn't need
a lot of it.

906
00:59:34,834 --> 00:59:36,625
She's very self-sufficient.

907
00:59:36,709 --> 00:59:37,792
Oh, well...

908
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,417
When you're on your own

909
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,542
you darn well better
be self-sufficient.

910
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,792
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?

911
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,500
It means what it means.

912
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,208
Well, thanks.

913
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,667
That clears it up.

914
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,083
Okay...

915
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:57,291
Let me put it this way.

916
00:59:57,375 --> 01:00:01,375
How much time have you spent
with clea since Simon died?

917
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,125
I'm with her every day.

918
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:07,291
But have you actually
talked to her about Simon?

919
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,500
About her feelings?

920
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,166
Have you held her?
Reassured her?

921
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,542
She doesn't turn to me
for that, mother.

922
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:18,166
Why are you attacking me?

923
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,709
It's not an attack.

924
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:23,083
It's just an observation.

925
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:26,792
I'm someone who looks at you
and sees herself.

926
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,959
What?

927
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:39,000
When Neal called me in Santa Fe,
he said, "Nora needs you."

928
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Those words rang in my ears.

929
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,959
I'd never heard them before.

930
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,709
( Chuckles softly )

931
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,375
"Nora needs you."

932
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,000
You never needed me.

933
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:58,417
Not since you were
a little child.

934
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,083
Or so I thought

935
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:04,208
because you never
came to me for things.

936
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:09,500
As I traveled back here...

937
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:15,125
During that...
Long night ride home

938
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:19,709
the closer I got, the more
I began to... to panic.

939
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,291
I didn't know how to help you.

940
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,333
What to say
or what to do.

941
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,083
( Sighs )

942
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:32,083
But... I needn't have worried.

943
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,333
I don't have to do anything...

944
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:43,583
Because you haven't
turned to me.

945
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,166
In the weeks
since I've been home, we...

946
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,250
We haven't even talked...
I mean heart-to-heart.

947
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:55,291
On one hand,
that's been a relief...

948
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:58,750
And on the other,
it's just made me feel empty

949
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,625
and... useless.

950
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:05,291
Oh, don't ever feel that, mama.

951
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:11,875
I know you're there
for me if I need it.

952
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,166
I just don't need it.

953
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:19,500
Oh... that's just it,
my darling... you do need it.

954
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,959
You just don't know how to ask

955
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:24,959
and I don't know
how to make you.

956
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:45,959
Well...

957
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,834
I have some clothes
in the dryer.

958
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,166
Will we have
horses in Seattle?

959
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,542
No.

960
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,291
I haven't been
riding since...

961
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,709
I know.

962
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:38,458
Neither have I.

963
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,709
Do you think
it would be all right

964
01:03:46,792 --> 01:03:48,500
if I took Perseus out?

965
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:51,000
No. I'd rather
you didn't.

966
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:53,166
Just once...
Before we leave?

967
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,625
I don't know.

968
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,083
Please?

969
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:04,917
Well, maybe
if you wear a helmet.

970
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,834
You want to come with me?

971
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:15,041
No, I...

972
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,291
I don't think I'm ready yet.

973
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:23,458
Do you know how long it's been
since we went riding together

974
01:04:23,542 --> 01:04:25,417
just you and me?

975
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:31,583
Eleven and a half months.

976
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:38,959
Please come with me, mom.

977
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:28,458
Mr. Mahler?

978
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:29,458
Yes, hello.

979
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:30,917
So glad you could make it.

980
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,208
As you can see,
it's all been freshly painted.

981
01:05:34,291 --> 01:05:36,125
So, it's very, very clean.

982
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,875
All the furniture
is top of the line.

983
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:40,291
It's fully stocked

984
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:43,166
with glassware and China...
Kitchenware.

985
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,166
All of the appliances
are new,

986
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,291
and you have your
own washer and dryer.

987
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,166
Uh, two bedrooms and,
uh, two full baths.

988
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,667
We can arrange
a cleaning service if you like

989
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,917
and there's
reserved parking.

990
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,875
I'll take it.

991
01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:02,625
Good.

992
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,083
( Crickets chirping )

993
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,458
( Screen door creaking
and shutting )

994
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,458
There you go, oz.

995
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,709
Thank you, ma'am.

996
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:12,834
Iris.

997
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:14,166
Oh, none for me.

998
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,834
If oz overindulges,
I'm the designated chef.

999
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,333
( Chuckling )

1000
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:22,959
Is an English saddle
easier or harder to ride?

1001
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:25,834
It's probably harder
at first.

1002
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:28,542
Some people think
it's more graceful.

1003
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,333
Would you say that I'm graceful?

1004
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:35,041
I'd say potentially
that you're very graceful.

1005
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:40,583
Well... would you teach me
to ride English?

1006
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,333
Oh, clea...

1007
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:45,542
We don't have a lot of time.

1008
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:48,458
But we could start tomorrow,
right after school.

1009
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:53,166
Okay.

1010
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:55,625
Okay.

1011
01:06:55,709 --> 01:06:56,875
( Chuckles )

1012
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:58,875
( Acoustic guitar strumming )

1013
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:00,792
( Crickets chirping )

1014
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,792
( Door creaking )

1015
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,125
( Muted guitar strumming )

1016
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,458
I love hearing Luis play.

1017
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:29,417
It's soothing,
like a warm bath.

1018
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,166
I envy people who
have musical talent.

1019
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,333
Yeah, my grandmother
made me take piano lessons.

1020
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:38,125
I had to practice
every day

1021
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,125
which I regarded
as punishment

1022
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:43,458
seeing as I just wanted
to be out, riding my horse.

1023
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,834
I wish I hadn't been
such a stubborn little brat.

1024
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,667
( Guitar strumming continuing)

1025
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,333
( Creaking )

1026
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,208
( Creaking )

1027
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:24,333
( Crickets chirping )

1028
01:08:28,417 --> 01:08:29,792
( Chimes tinkling )

1029
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:33,458
Here you are.

1030
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:40,250
Did you know that when
the breeze blows this way

1031
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,959
you can hear
the wind chimes

1032
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:43,834
from oz and Iris'
walnut tree?

1033
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:45,083
I never noticed that.

1034
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,500
Me, neither...

1035
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:49,166
But I've been noticing things
I never did before.

1036
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,250
So, now, I can end up
missing all of it.

1037
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:52,500
( Chuckles )

1038
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:54,792
You having second
thoughts about leaving?

1039
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:57,458
No.

1040
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,041
Are you?

1041
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,333
No.

1042
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:04,709
That's good.

1043
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:07,375
Right.

1044
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:11,000
I've been discovering
things, too...

1045
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,375
Amazing things...

1046
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:15,333
Like the fact that you
can play the guitar.

1047
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,834
It's not that hard.

1048
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:20,166
Luis has been teaching me
and Simon for about a year now.

1049
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,458
I'm not talking
about how hard it is.

1050
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,166
I'm talking
about the fact

1051
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,041
that I was
completely unaware.

1052
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:28,500
I thought I knew my
children inside out.

1053
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,750
I don't even know
how much I know

1054
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,583
and how much
I don't know.

1055
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:52,750
You've never talked to me
about... Simon's death...

1056
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:59,208
What happened...

1057
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,291
How you felt

1058
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:04,417
how... you feel.

1059
01:10:06,208 --> 01:10:08,625
I realize I've been selfish

1060
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:12,750
treating this as...
My own personal tragedy

1061
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:17,583
not thinking about what you
might be feeling...

1062
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,417
But I can
listen now...

1063
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,625
If you want.

1064
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,291
Thanks, mom.

1065
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:53,625
( Distant dog barking )

1066
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,500
I'm back.

1067
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:08,500
Clea?

1068
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:11,917
Nora?

1069
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:18,458
You're right,
it's more... graceful.

1070
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:21,750
Don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it.

1071
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:22,917
Really?

1072
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,417
Sure, it just
takes time.

1073
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,875
It's good... your
first time posting.

1074
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:30,959
( Nickers )

1075
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:32,959
I wish we...

1076
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:35,542
Wish what, clea?

1077
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:36,792
Nothing.

1078
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,667
Wish what?

1079
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,667
I wish things
were different.

I missed you, daddy.

1083
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,875
Missed you, too,
honey.

1084
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,041
You look good, Neal.

1085
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,083
Neal:
I am good.

1086
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,000
I wasn't sure
where you two were.

1087
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,291
I called Maggie.

1088
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,166
She didn't mention
you were out riding.

1089
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,208
Well...

1090
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:22,625
Now you know.

1091
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:30,834
( Hooves departing )

1092
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:34,500
Looks like I missed
a heck of a cookout.

1093
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,625
Mm-hmm,
oz outdid himself.

1094
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:39,375
I'm going to miss
Oz's barbecues.

1095
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,709
I'm going to miss
oz and Iris.

1096
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,625
But me you're not
too sure about, huh?

1097
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:46,750
Nah, I'll miss
you a lot, Maggie.

1098
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:49,500
When we buy our new house,
we'll make sure

1099
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:52,041
there's a terrific
guest room for you.

1100
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:54,083
With a private
bathroom, please.

1101
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,500
And monogrammed towels.

1102
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,750
( Chuckles )

1103
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,250
I think you'll like
the temporary apartment.

1104
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:01,500
It's got a great view.

1105
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,709
The furniture is nothing
to write home about

1106
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,500
but it shouldn't
take us too long

1107
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,792
to find
a house we like...

1108
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,041
And I checked out
your new high school.

1109
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,000
It's big but modern

1110
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:12,333
not the urban nightmare
you were dreading

1111
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:14,458
and the kids look
just like the kids here

1112
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,000
except more colorful hair.

1113
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:16,959
( Chuckles )

1114
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:20,083
My new secretary made
a list for you, Nora...

1115
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,667
Of all the

1116
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,625
um...

1117
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:28,750
Okay...

1118
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:31,917
What am I not getting here?

1119
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,625
Nora:
Neal...

1120
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,917
I'm not as sure
about this move

1121
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,625
as I thought I was.

1122
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:44,750
I know you've been...

1123
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:48,458
Working hard, doing
what you felt was

1124
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:50,458
in all of our
best interests

1125
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,208
and I went
along with it

1126
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,875
but I wasn't thinking
very clearly.

1127
01:13:54,959 --> 01:13:56,500
And now you are.

1128
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,458
Yes, I believe I am.

1129
01:13:58,542 --> 01:14:01,542
Neal, you need to understand...

1130
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,458
Understand what,
Nora?

1131
01:14:03,542 --> 01:14:06,041
That you're impulsive

1132
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,125
and self-absorbed?

1133
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,291
I understand that.

1134
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,792
I've always understood it.

1135
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,583
This isn't
just about me.

1136
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,166
Since you've been gone,
I've gotten closer to clea

1137
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,917
in a way that I'm ashamed
to say I never have.

1138
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,083
You're trying to bring clea
into your camp.

1139
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:23,667
Nora:
I don't have a camp.

1140
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,000
Neal:
Sure, you do.

1141
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:26,291
It used to be

1142
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,208
you and Simon.

1143
01:14:28,291 --> 01:14:29,667
It was never like that.

1144
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,333
Oh, yes, it was, and now
you're recruiting clea?

1145
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,834
Well, I won't
let you do it.

1146
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:34,583
Clea and I

1147
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,834
will leave here
without you.

1148
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:38,709
Clea:
Dad...

1149
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,083
I don't want to leave home.

1150
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,542
( Sighs )

1151
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,041
I had nothing to do with this.

1152
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:55,417
Nora:
Neal...

1153
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,458
Listen to me...

1154
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:57,792
Neal:
You expect me

1155
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,500
to give in, like I always do,

1156
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,500
like I always have.

1157
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,834
You had to board horses.

1158
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:03,667
You had to teach the children
to ride.

1159
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,125
I gave in to you every time,

1160
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,709
crumbled before the will
of the almighty Nora.

1161
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:08,959
Well, not this time.

1162
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,083
You go ahead.

1163
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,792
You stay here with your mother
and your daughter

1164
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,333
and your precious horses!

1165
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:15,667
I'll be in Seattle.

1166
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,583
( Door closing )

1167
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:33,917
( Car engine starting )

1168
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,208
( Sighs )

1169
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,709
Clea:
Dad. Dad!

1170
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:38,875
Dad!

1171
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:39,875
No.

1172
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:41,000
Dad!

1173
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,333
( Crying )

1174
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,959
Maggie:
Neal?

1175
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:57,834
Come to gloat?

1176
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,583
You finally got rid
of me...

1177
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:01,375
20 years later
than you wanted,

1178
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:03,542
but, hey,
you can't have everything.

1179
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,208
I never disliked
you, Neal.

1180
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,583
I know you're
a good man.

1181
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:07,875
I was just
always afraid

1182
01:16:07,959 --> 01:16:09,625
that you couldn't
handle her.

1183
01:16:09,709 --> 01:16:10,625
She's tough!

1184
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:11,917
I could never
handle her.

1185
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,041
I was afraid when
the chips were down,

1186
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,333
you... you wouldn't
know what to do...

1187
01:16:16,417 --> 01:16:18,041
And the chips are
down now, Neal.

1188
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:21,083
You've got to fight
to keep your family together.

1189
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,375
I am fighting...

1190
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,709
For myself, for once.

1191
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,375
Yeah, but don't
just walk away.

1192
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:26,417
Go back to the farm.

1193
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,500
Face her.
Talk it out.

1194
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,667
Oh, I see...
It's up to me.

1195
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,750
I have to reach out.

1196
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,166
I have to go
back, give in

1197
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,083
accommodate.
That's not
what I'm saying.

1198
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,208
Well, not anymore.
Never again.

1199
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,959
Bye, Maggie.

1200
01:17:39,917 --> 01:17:43,375
Mmm, this is so good.

1201
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,625
Mm-hmm.
I never remember

1202
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:47,583
you making a pot roast
before, mama.

1203
01:17:47,667 --> 01:17:48,959
I must have once.

1204
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:53,166
Maybe when you were
in grade school or something.

1205
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,083
I remember grandma

1206
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,500
used to make huge
meals every day.

1207
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:59,625
Yes, and grandma was
also a size 16.

1208
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:00,917
( Chuckles )

1209
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:10,542
So, how was school today, honey?

1210
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,166
It was okay.

1211
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,875
You want to ditch
your homework?

1212
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:21,542
Go catch a movie
at the mall?

1213
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:24,208
Maybe grandma
wants to join us.

1214
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:26,333
Yeah. Let's just leave
the dishes and go.

1215
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:30,375
No, I'd better study.

1216
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,458
What am I going
to do with her?

1217
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:37,458
You all done?

1218
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,458
Yeah.

1219
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:40,125
Thanks for dinner, grandma.

1220
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,166
Leave that, honey.

1221
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,333
I'll clean up.

1222
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:43,417
You go study.

1223
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,792
I'll be upstairs.

1224
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:52,834
( Sighs )

1225
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:05,250
( Clea sobbing )

1226
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:17,083
It's too late.

1227
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,000
I heard you.

1228
01:19:28,166 --> 01:19:29,417
Tell me.

1229
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:34,208
All right, then.

1230
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:37,917
You just nod your head
yes or no, okay?

1231
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,333
Are you crying
about your dad?

1232
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,166
I know you
miss him, honey

1233
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,625
but you're going
to visit him soon.

1234
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:50,000
And it's not your
fault he's gone.

1235
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:54,709
But it is.

1236
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:56,667
It is.

1237
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,417
All of it is
my fault, grandma.

1238
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,417
Everything that's happened.

1239
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,834
Oh, honey, why would you
want to feel like that?

1240
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,625
I don't want to feel it.

1241
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:12,333
It's true.

1242
01:20:12,417 --> 01:20:16,667
Everything is horrible,
and it's my fault.

1243
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:19,000
Oh, no, not everything.

1244
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:22,125
You and your mother
have gotten closer.

1245
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:29,583
That's only because
she doesn't know.

1246
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:30,875
Know what?

1247
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:34,500
What, baby?

1248
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:37,834
That I killed Simon.

1249
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,417
Oh, clea!

1250
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,917
I killed Simon.

1251
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,125
It's my fault
that he's dead.

1252
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:45,959
Clea.

1253
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,083
( Knocking )

1254
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:55,500
I talked him into riding
and then...

1255
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,417
I made him race me,
which he didn't even want to do

1256
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,500
but I made him...

1257
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:01,417
( Sobbing )

1258
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,208
And then...

1259
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:08,959
Zad balked, and Simon fell,
and it was because of me!

1260
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:14,375
No, it's not your fault.

1261
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,709
It was an accident.

1262
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:19,583
You didn't kill him.

1263
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,583
You can't carry
that with you.

1264
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:26,750
Oh, clea,
my sweet clea.

1265
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:29,625
Why did you keep that
in all this time?

1266
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,917
Oh, mama.

1267
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,625
I am so sorry.

1268
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:41,625
That's okay.

1269
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:43,375
That's okay, baby.

1270
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,333
You'll be okay.

1271
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:48,959
I'm right here.

1272
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,875
Nora:
Thanks for the hay, oz.

1273
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:30,250
I appreciate it.

1274
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,667
No problem.

1275
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:35,458
Iris and I are glad
that you decided

1276
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:37,000
not to sell the farm.

1277
01:22:37,083 --> 01:22:39,458
You know, I've
lived my whole life

1278
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:40,959
next to your family.

1279
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,834
Just wouldn't be the same.

1280
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,959
No, nothing will ever
be the same, oz.

1281
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,750
Simon's death
saw to that.

1282
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:52,208
It took him away and...

1283
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:56,667
Now it's taken away Neal.

1284
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,333
You're laying that weight
on Simon's shoulders?

1285
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:03,625
Let that poor boy
rest in peace.

1286
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:04,875
What are you saying?

1287
01:23:04,959 --> 01:23:05,959
You heard me.

1288
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,709
I spoke plain enough.

1289
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:11,458
Don't blame your marriage
problems on a dead boy.

1290
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:14,959
Your marriage had
just as many problems

1291
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:16,625
while he was alive.

1292
01:23:18,291 --> 01:23:20,333
Now, you just
hold on a minute.

1293
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,542
Listen to me.

1294
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:23,917
I don't claim to know
everything that goes on

1295
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,583
between a man and a woman

1296
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,125
but turn the clock back

1297
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:29,834
to that last day
before the accident.

1298
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,625
Now, you tell me I'm wrong.

1299
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,709
( Sighs )

1300
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:53,000
( Typing )

1301
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:54,750
( Door opens )

1302
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,875
Mom, have you been
waiting for me?

1303
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:58,166
No, I'm a little early.

1304
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,125
I'll just be a minute.

1305
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,625
Take your time.

1306
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:05,000
( Resumes typing )

1307
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,041
Fran:
I can pick up
the pills, too.

1308
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:11,583
No, mother,
I won't forget.

1309
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:14,750
All right. Bye-bye.

1310
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:16,250
Hello, Nora.

1311
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:19,250
You've made the place
look nice.

1312
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:22,417
Didn't change
a thing.

1313
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,792
You haven't been
here in a while.

1314
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,250
Do you hear from Neal?

1315
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,917
Practically every day.

1316
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,667
He calls to check
on clients,

1317
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,000
see how I'm getting along.

1318
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:39,917
Does he ask about us?

1319
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,208
Of course.

1320
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:44,333
Why do you think
he's really calling?

1321
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,917
Nora:
That's when Neal
got the award

1322
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,083
from the chamber
of commerce.

1323
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,083
I'd forgotten about that.

1324
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,750
You weren't there.

1325
01:24:56,834 --> 01:24:58,542
You were busy that day.

1326
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:00,333
Oh.

1327
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:08,375
So, how's he doing?

1328
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,583
Is he doing okay
up there?

1329
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:13,834
How okay do you think
he could be without his family?

1330
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,792
You don't like me much, do you?

1331
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,625
Not much.

1332
01:25:21,709 --> 01:25:23,041
But I like Neal

1333
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:25,709
and I want what's
best for him.

1334
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:31,000
I don't think he's going to be
able to get over Simon's death

1335
01:25:31,083 --> 01:25:32,709
without your help.

1336
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:06,667
Aren't you going
to ask me in?

1337
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,667
Dirty socks and stuff.

1338
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,500
You know, bachelor pad.

1339
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,959
I've seen your
socks before.

1340
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,333
It's nice.

1341
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:32,834
Especially the art work.

1342
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:35,291
Glad you like it.

1343
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,792
If I'd known
you were coming,

1344
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:39,041
I'd have gotten

1345
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:41,166
the mu shu combo.

1346
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:44,875
Comes with extra egg roll.

1347
01:26:44,959 --> 01:26:47,083
I don't need
food, Neal.

1348
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:51,875
What I need is you.

1349
01:26:51,959 --> 01:26:55,625
My whole life...

1350
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:57,834
You've always
just been there...

1351
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:02,792
Like the air I breathe.

1352
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,834
You don't appreciate air

1353
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:07,542
till you're suddenly
short of breath,

1354
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:10,917
and then it's all
you can think about.

1355
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,667
Home isn't home without you.

1356
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,750
I didn't know that
till you were gone.

1357
01:27:21,709 --> 01:27:23,750
( Sighs )

1358
01:27:25,834 --> 01:27:28,500
I need you so much.

1359
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:33,417
It's still just
about what you need.

1360
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,291
You haven't asked
about me.

1361
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,959
I was going to ask.

1362
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,083
I want to ask.

1363
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,959
I don't mean just now.

1364
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,959
I mean ever.

1365
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:45,542
Well, that'll change.

1366
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:47,625
I know I've got work
to do, Neal.

1367
01:27:47,709 --> 01:27:49,208
I'll do it.

1368
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:50,417
I don't want it to be work.

1369
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,000
I want it to be instinctive,

1370
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,709
but that can't happen.

1371
01:27:54,792 --> 01:27:57,208
Leopards don't change
their spots.

1372
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,834
You're so angry.

1373
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:00,834
Why are you so angry?

1374
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:05,166
Well, you can thank
yourself for that.

1375
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:09,709
You do blame me...

1376
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:12,166
For all of it.

1377
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:16,041
Look, you came here
to get me to come back.

1378
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,500
Well, forget it.

1379
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:21,166
You've made your choice,
I've made mine.

1380
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,375
Go home, Nora.

1381
01:29:49,834 --> 01:29:52,250
I used to love taking care
of the clients.

1382
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:56,333
I was good at it, too, but now
I've got to get out and sell

1383
01:29:56,417 --> 01:29:59,583
which requires
Patience and tact...

1384
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:02,083
Two of my greatest virtues.

1385
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:03,917
I'm sure you've noticed.

1386
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,917
Maybe it gets easier
with practice.

1387
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Maybe.

1388
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,542
( Door opening )

1389
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,250
Uh... can I
talk to you?

1390
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,000
Alone?

1391
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:22,166
I'm a potted plant.

1392
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,500
( Sighs )

1393
01:30:25,583 --> 01:30:28,083
Look, uh, you said
if I'd ever given you

1394
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,291
a ring or anything

1395
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,834
you'd be throwing
it in my face.

1396
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:32,875
So, uh...

1397
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:38,583
Don't throw it
in my face, okay?

1398
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:49,375
I miss you.

1399
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:52,625
I even miss
all the drama.

1400
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:56,875
And I can deal with it
as long as you need me to.

1401
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,250
Come here.

1402
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:12,291
( Clea sighing )

1403
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:19,083
This should be pretty sturdy.

1404
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:20,417
Thanks.

1405
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,500
You need any
help packing?

1406
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:24,875
I got it.

1407
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:29,417
Do you think
it'll rain up there?

1408
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,667
I think that's
a pretty safe bet.

1409
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:43,417
So, when you're up
there this weekend,

1410
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,709
why don't you take
a good look around?

1411
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:49,208
See how you like
it up there.

1412
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:53,750
You mean see how I like it
for more than just a weekend?

1413
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:58,000
Just think about it.

1414
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:06,667
I made reservations
for tonight at a restaurant

1415
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,583
that's supposedly very upscale.

1416
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:11,333
I've never been,
so you'll be the judge.

1417
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:12,458
Dad, what do I know?

1418
01:32:12,542 --> 01:32:14,375
In elk Springs,
upscale is anyplace

1419
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:16,583
that doesn't have a
drive-through window.

1420
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:19,542
And we've got tickets
for the ice show tomorrow night.

1421
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:22,083
Dad, I really appreciate
you going all out for me

1422
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:25,041
but what I want to do is
have a look around town...

1423
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:26,208
The high school, and...

1424
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,667
The high school?

1425
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,709
I want to know what it'd
be like to live here.

1426
01:32:30,792 --> 01:32:34,917
Clea, did you and your mother
have a fight or something?

1427
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,250
No.

1428
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:38,667
I want to come home.

1429
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:39,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1430
01:32:39,834 --> 01:32:41,792
You and your mother
live at home.

1431
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:42,583
No.

1432
01:32:42,667 --> 01:32:44,375
Home is where you are.

1433
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:47,083
I want to be home with you

1434
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:49,625
wherever that
has to be.

1435
01:32:49,709 --> 01:32:51,542
And your mother?

1436
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:54,625
I think she feels
the same way.

1437
01:32:57,083 --> 01:32:57,959
So...

1438
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:00,667
Why don't we ditch
the fine dining

1439
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,083
and check out
the fast food joints

1440
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,667
because I need to know

1441
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:07,166
what Seattle burritos
taste like.

1442
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,375
What's going on?

1443
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:38,083
Well, we came back early.

1444
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:42,083
Oh, so I see.

1445
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,375
I'm glad.

1446
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:54,125
She's out riding.

1447
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:13,875
( Footsteps approach )

1448
01:34:13,959 --> 01:34:15,583
Something
happen to clea?

1449
01:34:15,667 --> 01:34:16,792
No, no.

1450
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:17,875
Clea's fine.

1451
01:34:17,959 --> 01:34:20,875
She's here,
back at the house.

1452
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:26,333
Is this where you found him?

1453
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,875
Yes.

1454
01:34:34,834 --> 01:34:37,000
I never came out to look.

1455
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:43,166
I wasn't ready for him to die.

1456
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:48,041
I haven't come
to terms with it.

1457
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:50,917
I'm still filled
with anger and grief...

1458
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,417
That I haven't let myself feel.

1459
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:59,417
I think I have to do that
before I can do anything else.

1460
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:05,083
I'd like to do it with you.

1461
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,291
If you'll let me.
