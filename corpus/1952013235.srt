So you see with your eyes
What kind of dog food selling.

23

00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,372
He asked me to take care of Duke

Hold the elevator!

83
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:48,046

84
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,632
Can I help you?

85
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,421
Yes, good evening.

86
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,993
I came to see Emily Posar.

87
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:54,693

Thanks a lot.

91
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:06,297

92
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,913
to tiga contracts like these.

93
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:11,649
Three're i. One.
Tell them what there a point to Tell them.

94
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:13,785
Two. Tell them.

95
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,512
Three.
Tell them what you have said.

96
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,034
So therefore, a closed

97
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,880
you are our lassie
a specific impulse better by 3%

98
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,061
C-level exhaust

99
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:27,073
and when it refuses such a thing,
deserves another Sputnik.

00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:33,333
<i> Where are you? Have dinner? </i>

101
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,028

Honey!

105
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,644
Everyone at work said
we are on time for summer.

106
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:57,045
- I'll be here for some time.
- I repeat that not all ...

107
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:59,369
It happens all the time
and always because of the service.

108
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,459
- I'm sorry.
- I'm mad at you.

109
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:04,639

<i> Are you okay? </i>

116
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,790
Normal.

117
00:12:36,317 --> 00:12:38,317
<i> Why did you disconnected the phone fixed? </i>

118
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,011
He broke the phone.

119
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,863
<i> I don 't need it. </i>

120
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,524
We did what?

121
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:55,155

00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:14,116
Talk to you later.
Take care of yourself.

127
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,731
Wait a!
I know it has been a while ...

128
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:22,083
But when you stayed with us,
n You got something of mine in the Black Sea's ealã, right?

129
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:25,487
I remember that I gave you something.

130
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,307
Stop Do you remember?
Because I remember very clearly.

131
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:35,080
Yes.

00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:39,696
Do not forget I love you.

133
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,363
Hello, my name is Ben Thomas.
I came to Stewart Goodman.

134
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:22,683
Inez, look at me, please.

135
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:26,139
Inez! I am talking to you.

136
00:14:29,257 --> 00:14:32,125
We understand each other and that you refused
're taking medicine today, is it?

137
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:34,611
No, no ...

138
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,787
Come on, try using
your words, yes, Inez?

139
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:43,156
If you do not talk, do not help anybody.

140
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,247
Inez, how to help you if you ...

141
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:50,984
Okay, I'll return tomorrow

00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,486
I think it's a Friday
Your office today.

144
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:03,308
Yes, but I was around and
I thought to spare you from a road.

145
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,730
Wonderful.
Let's talk in my office.

146
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,351
Come on.

147
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:08,952
My approach is to give up
inutilitãþile at all,

148
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:13,313
I reduced the costs of maintenance
out of here with just over 17% last year.

149
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,041
I am sure that
that he has done very fericiþi.

150
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:18,544
Obviously!

151
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:22,112
If I'm able to manage
and personal money in this way ...

152
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,618
You never have be here.
No offense.

153
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:27,493
Is your BMW's out?

154
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,230
Ben, look what I mean ...

155
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,442
When I learned that the transplant
bone marrow he got it ...

156
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,609
I know what is the status of your care.

157
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,466
Status is not promiþãtoare
for me.

158
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:50,174
Remember ...

159
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,387
In January,
I'll get a bonus.

160
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:55,917
We need
that the postponement of six months.

161
00:15:56,832 --> 00:16:00,582
I mean,
I do everything I can here, I swear.

162
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:14,947
I'll go ...
Keep in touch.

163
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:19,531
Thanks, I appreciate enormously.
Thus, like tigã everybody, right?

164
00:16:32,744 --> 00:16:34,744
Good afternoon.

165
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,621
I'm called Ben.

166
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,769
You do not know if there a point
I speak not with me,

167
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:52,914
but I like to kidnap
Just a minute of your time

168
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:17,237
I'm trying to find out
What kind of man is Stewart Goodman.

169
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:26,047
It's in my power
to change the situation radically.

170
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,758
But I do not want to give a gift
you do not deserve it.

171
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:39,008
Want to Tell me if
or is not a good man.

172
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:13,446
"The medicine that I get
I do not ameþesc. "

173
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,667
"I want another."

174
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:24,624
It seems very reasonable, Inez.
What else?

175
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:30,414
You can trust me.

176
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:35,873
What else, Inez?

177
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:55,952
I punishments me?
In what way?

178
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:03,424
What is your punishment it, Inez?

179
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,069
Ben?

180
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,128
Ben, where are you going?

181
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,239
- Where's the bathroom?
- Right.

182
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:34,884
Is something wrong?

183
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,835
- Do the bathroom. Now!
- Of course!

184
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,101
Thanks. Thanks ...

185
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,784
Ben, I think you have made
I think itã mistake.

186
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,639
Going to go around
from time to time

187
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,030
to make sure that
I think respecþi people you knew.

188
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:52,944
- It's a surprise, right?
- Not so you act with people.

189
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:57,277
- Let me explain to you, Ben.
- Do not you agree postponement.

190
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,239
Ben!

191
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,919
Does not give you anything!

192
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,836
I almost thought, you bastard.
I almost thought!

193
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:25,395
Hi!

194
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,853
Hi, Michelle.

195
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,523
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

196
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:34,283
- What are you doing?
- Okay.

197
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:36,284
- Hey, man.
- What are you doing here?

198
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:40,385
I came to see if
Do you fight at all.

199
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,696
And that's it.

200
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,344
- Can we talk a little bit?
- Yes.

201
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:51,417
- Are you all right?
- Yes. You said you call me.

202
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,157
On 15.
Today we are 19.

203
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:58,546
I know, the doctor had no results,
so I had what information to give you.

204
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:00,964
And even so,
I should call.

205
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,728
- No?
- Yes, I know.

206
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,728
- There are friends, right?
- Yes.

207
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:09,292
I'm looking and I get some people, understand?

208
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,754
Do not do that.

209
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:16,028
- We have a plan.
- I know.

210
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,029
- Do what you promised.
- That'll do.

211
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,804
Do you know I can rent clubs
from the club.

212
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,973
I know this very well.
I guess I do not want to get beat today.

213
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,971
I looked at him or me?

214
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:50,242
In fact, just sat here.

215
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,128
I do it right?

216
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:58,181
- I think I saw recently in the elevator.
- Yes ...

217
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,452
In fact, you do an audit.

218
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:08,842
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm from the exchequer.

219
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:14,996
And you're owe the state
with 56240.19 U.S. dollars.

220
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:19,086
- I know.
- And now, you scroll with me.

221
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,128
Instead there a point to contact, please,
Miss Posar?

222
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:30,574
I looked over declaraþiile income
in the past three years.

223
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:34,246
- 2005, 200 ...
- You were ...

224
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:37,491
You were like in my room last night?

225
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,205
No, ma'am.
I was in your room last night.

226
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:48,287
This is not protocol
a staff of the exchequer.

227
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,947
I looked over declaraþiile
in 2005, 2006 and 2007

228
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,067
and appears to be a discrepanþã
between the declaration and I. ..

229
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:58,116
Mr Thomas ...

230
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,526
I have just been fired.

231
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:06,442
So if I send
in a prison of Tax

232
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:09,754
I want very much to get home.

233
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:13,100
Sure. No problem.

234
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,542
Þinem connection.

235
00:24:57,793 --> 00:24:59,840
Welcome to Travel Inn.
How can I help?

236
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:03,929
- I want a room.
- For how many hours?

237
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,655
A couple of weeks.

238
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,960
<i>And seven people
died in a serious accident </i>

239
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:42,999
That's right! Come on!

240
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:49,037
Ready, ready, that is!

241
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,383
Rico!

242
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,892
Rico, finish it!

243
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,385
Anybody want to remind them of Rico
where are we?

244
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,686
In the sanctuary, Mr trainer!

245
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,776
- You will not hear.
- In the sanctuary, Mr trainer!

246
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:10,121
Specifically, Rico, in the sanctuary.

247
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:12,454
Now do 20 starts and stops.

248
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,838
<i> Hi, I'm Emily Posa. </i>

249
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:21,704
<i> I'm not home now, but leave a message
and we'll call you back as soon as I can. </i>

250
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:22,910
<i> Thanks. </i>

251
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,470
<i> Hi, my name is Susan Noah. </i>

252
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,154
<i> because I called a friend
It was the link and was wondering ...</i>

253
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:31,327
Hi. I'm Emily.

254
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:40,502
Yes, people do the wedding.
Currently, can not receive.

255
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:43,587

people who do.

256
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:47,569
Not knowing as well as me,
but preþuri better.

257
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,121
Hello?

258
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:00,747
Duke!

259
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,068
Duke!

260
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:08,069
We're here!

261
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:18,376
- Hello, Miss Posa.

262
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,132

264
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:30,013
That is meat? No! No, no!

265
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,481
No meat! No!

266
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:36,709
- I liked it much.
- He mãnâncã boiled broccoli and Tofu.

267
00:27:37,453 --> 00:27:40,043
- Why?
- Because he's a vegetarian.

268
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,824
- He's a vegetarian?
- Yes.

269
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:45,718
What am I bye.

270
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,808
Can we talk? Take a minute?

271
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:53,693
No. I gotta get on Duke
to walk.

272
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,351
No problem.
Go with you, if you do not bother.

273
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:10,432
I looked over
Acts of 2005, 2006 and 2007 ...

274
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:13,236
- God ...
- Listen.

275
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:17,115
- Let him þÎñ me?
- No. I'm fine.

276
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:22,800
- I ride. Simþiþi you okay?
- Yes.

277
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,908
Sorry.

278
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,371
- Sit like a.
- Nothing.

279
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,572
- Caution!
- Sit down!

280
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,634
Maybe I would have to get more meat.

281
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,623
So I looked ...

282
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:41,181
- Can we do this later.
- Yes.

283
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:47,824
So gate before you, see.

284
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:51,005
No. I don 't know
when I cooked last time.

285
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:55,537
So are my sister
take care of me from distance.

286
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:03,302
- You have the fellowship?
- Yes, a brother. It's a good man.

287
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,450
Yes, and I am just a sister.

288
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:13,174
Have you received any money from any sursã
that the state does not know how anything?

289
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:17,635
Lately, I did diving
fântânile in local magical, so ...

290
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:23,137
I mean, do from time to time
but when you find 25 cenþi ...

291
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,669
In fact ...

292
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:28,176
I had
to my house refinanþez

293
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:30,177
to get my pay
the last two medical bills.

294
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:36,147
I was informed that
of a congenital heart defect.

295
00:29:36,677 --> 00:29:40,844
Yes. You learned that while
me at the hospital?

296
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,531
No ...

297
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,682
Now you're in condition 2.

298
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,683
Which means that
disease is quite advanced

299
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,537
how to be on the list supplied data
of waiting,

300
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:56,027
but not sufficiently advanced as
to be interned and put in state 1.

301
00:29:56,439 --> 00:30:01,098
So, basically, if the disease gets worse
and can not find any donor,

302
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:04,663
you put it.

303
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:09,567
Is it true that you said that ...

304
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:16,009
... nor do I think a heart meriþi
because life's unnoticed

305
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:18,304
in all ways possible?

306
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,549
Sorry ...

307
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,469
I do not know why I said that.
Sorry.

308
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:40,775
I have to take a course of sensitivity
that you hire the exchequer, Mr Thomas?

309
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:43,602
- No. Not really.
- Exactly.

310
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:48,590
So you do not find a good man?

311
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:53,130
How you answer that question
If you've wondered the same thing?

312
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:00,680
Unnoticed would be ...

313
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:04,489
... a îmbunãtãþire for me,
I assure you.

314
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,928
We'll freeze accounts
up to us and tiinþãri.

315
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:18,467
I'm sure I'll you so,
five or six months without penalty.

316
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:26,214
Look at my card.

317
00:31:26,215 --> 00:31:31,626
If you looking for someone to Tax
you to call me immediately.

318
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,233
Well.

319
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:36,794
Thanks.

320
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,244
Me giving thanks.

321
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,274
Ready.

322
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,701
- Sir Thomas!
- Yes?

323
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:04,777
Why do I feel that
I do a big favor now?

324
00:32:08,147 --> 00:32:11,579
Because I feel
that it really meriþi.

325
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:17,572
Okay?

326
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:24,717
Go ...

327
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,896
Are you going to contaminate
dog to someone else now?

328
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:33,194
No.

329
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,180
- I'm going and I home.
- Where?

330
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:52,889
- Take care of yourself, Emily.
- And you.

331
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,486
- What are these things?
- You 've said.

332
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:35,237
- Why did you bring a sense in the room?
- Because it is my room.

333
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:39,353
And I do not want to enter one
in my room, you understand each other?

334
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:42,314
I do not think you can
þii's a sense in the room.

335
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,765
I think I will.

336
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:47,855
I have never had someone
who had a þinut up in the room.

337
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:50,498
You now.

338
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,519
Good night.

339
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:12,765
<i> first time
I saw a poisonous jellyfish, </i>

340
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:17,509
<i> was 12 years. </i>

341
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:26,593
<i>Dad brought us
the tank in Monterey Bay. </i>

342
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,400
<i> I have never forgotten when he said
it's the most deadly vieþuitoare in the world. </i>

343
00:35:41,782 --> 00:35:43,782
<i> For me, it was just ...</i>

344
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,845
<i> ... the best thing
you ever saw. </i>

345
00:35:56,368 --> 00:36:00,163
I spoke again with the doctor and said
I send you the file tomorrow morning.

346
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:05,241
- Is that all?
- Yes.

347
00:36:07,226 --> 00:36:09,226
- Any questions?
- That's i.

348
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:12,075
Then I answer the same.

349
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:13,960
I thought last night
at the time

350
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:17,284
when I was on November 14 years
and I did our big deal.

351
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,515
Do you remember that in May on the beach,
in front grandparents house yours,

352
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:26,595
I was not agree to you in
even friends with one another?

353
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:29,973
And you remember that þÎñ
that night

354
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:32,134
you told me how much
I like Stacy Miller

355
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,691
and I mean it inviþi in the city.

356
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:40,670
And I did not think I can say,
I've done for it already.

357
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,980
What was not true,
but I,

358
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,956
and he likes more than you
than me ...

359
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,654
So I damn mind because
I was very jealous.

360
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:56,274
And I realized that I wore
that lie at the heart of the last 25 ...

361
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:59,276
Stop!

362
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,931
Stop!

363
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,690
Stay focused.

364
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,683
- Do what you promised.
- What, you think ...

365
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,788
Do what you promised!

366
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,025
You think I'll disappoint you, did you?

367
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,304
I know of a lifetime!

368
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:22,484
Yes?

369
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:27,011
Not doing so something every day, right?

370
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,756
U is not at all for you or me!

371
00:37:32,095 --> 00:37:34,096
We'll have to go all out
according to the plan.

372
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:43,628
Do not worry.

373
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,464
Thanks.

374
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,326
My God!

375
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:20,788
- Hi, Holly.
- Look at you!

376
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,997
- What cauþi here?
- I came to see you on.

377
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:30,402
- Really?
- Got a minute?

378
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,474
Course. Come on.
Come to my office.

379
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,327
Sit down.

380
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,465
- You look great.
- I know.

381
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,349
And I feel great.

382
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,298
- How are you?
- Very good.

383
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:02,700
- I need a favor.
- Whatever you need, just ask me.

384
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,884
I need a name.

385
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:09,897
Card system,
a woman increasingly difficult,

386
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:13,857
who needs help,
but too proud to ask.

387
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:22,949
- What are you doing?
- Help.

388
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:33,213
- I need a name.
- Okay.

389
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:38,045
<i> Connie rough. </i>

390
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:41,939
<i> her boyfriend almost killed her last year
when he wanted to go. </i>

391
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,403
<i> last month,
he has three fractured ribs. </i>

392
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,862
<i>It really freaked
to lodge a complaint, </i>

393
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,862
<i> and we can not do anything. </i>

394
00:40:04,507 --> 00:40:06,116
- Hi!
- Hello.

395
00:40:06,117 --> 00:40:08,613
- Connie rough?
- Yes.

396
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:11,418
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm from the exchequer.

397
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,245
From tax?
But I pay all taxes.

398
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,834
Yes, but now is more
a request for general information.

399
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:20,076
Do not know ...

400
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:22,840
Can I come in?

401
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,870
No, not now,
because my friend is not here.

402
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:29,281
It's very, very important
for your family.

403
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:32,144
- To my family?
- Yes.

404
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,281
Frumo and what they are.

405
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:49,090
Please sit down.

406
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:54,929
What is it?

407
00:40:56,305 --> 00:41:02,030
Your case I drew atenþia
and I wanted to meet you.

408
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:04,952
Let me know you? Why?

409
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:10,752
- Because I want to help.
- Do not know.

410
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:17,777
Are very well informed
in relation to the case of your ...

411
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,089
... and with your friend.

412
00:41:20,162 --> 00:41:22,162
What are you talking about?

413
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,110
You know better.

414
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,945
No, I do not know about
What are you talking about.

415
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,604
Children going into your room.

416
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:39,365
- The return?
- No, not back.

417
00:41:51,423 --> 00:41:54,407
You said you're from Tax
but damn mind.

418
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:56,620
- No.
- Do not tell the truth. Who sent you?

419
00:41:57,058 --> 00:42:00,707
- Sit down, please.
- I do not want to sit down.

420
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,341
- Please calm down.
- I do not want me to calm down.

421
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:07,957
Come to my home and are you talking about
about my case and about my friend?

422
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:10,035
What you know?
Who sent you here?

423
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:13,422
- Nobody.
- Then, and the outside now.

424
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,220
- You can trust me.
- Never trust anyone, Mr Thomas.

425
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:25,177
I spoke with Holly.
You can get out of here.

426
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:30,278
In a safe place.
In a beautiful place.

427
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:34,826
- Why did you talk to Holly?
- Your kids are in danger here.

428
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:38,206
Do not talk about my children, Mr Thomas,
I do not know what are you talking about.

429
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,610
You do not need you to live like this,
We're trying to help ...

430
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:43,199
I do not know you.
That's out of my house or call the police.

431
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,054
- Well, well ...
- Who are you?

432
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:47,549
- I want to get my card.
- I need your help.

433
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:50,862
- You can call me. I leave here.
- I need it.

434
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,008
Ready. Thanks a lot. Go away now.

435
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:56,085
- We're helpless.
- Get out now! It's my home.

436
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:58,701
- That's out now!
- Please Think about it a bit ...

437
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:01,808
Go away! Thanks a lot!
Goodbye!

438
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,459
I can not talk now.

439
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,348
<i> No! We need to talk urgently.
Where are you? </i>

440
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,945
- Nowhere.
- See the house, right?

441
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:29,546
No, not at the house.
I'm gone somewhere.

442
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:33,319
- Let's talk next week.
- No, you should discuss now!

443
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:35,518
- What are you?
- Okay.

444
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:40,777
- It's a great day.
- Yes. He said with dialysis, George.

445
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:42,902
- See the Hall of operations.
- Yes.

446
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,751
See you in November and there.

447
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,751
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

448
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,567
I heard that you have raised enough money

449
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,398
So you give them to children
parþiale scholarships for college.

450
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,113
Yeah, no big deal.

451
00:44:56,114 --> 00:45:00,327
I have convinced us up donors înstãriþi
that the world needs

452
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:03,367
May I see many Latin Americans
on ice.

453
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:09,731
You know, Ben,
I still wonder that,

454
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,788
but why me?

455
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:21,499
- Because you're a good man.
- No, seriously.

456
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:27,061
Even when you do not know
someone looks at you.

457
00:45:39,756 --> 00:45:41,756
<i> Hello. </i>

458
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,376
Hello.

459
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,391
Hello!

00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:53,077
<i> Well, we do not hear you,

They are superb!

From cojile bananas.
Who would you know?

466
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,510
Emily?

467
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:55,292

468
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,605

469
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:04,682

00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:17,412
Yes. Well. It's pretty busy with school,
but maybe after entering the vacation.

472
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:19,816
It's perfect.

473
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,119
How is the pie?

474
00:50:48,759 --> 00:50:50,861
It's good.

475
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:55,470
N-inviþi once in a town?
On chelneriþã?

476
00:50:57,912 --> 00:51:00,351
No.

477
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,515
It is not never knows.

478
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:07,888
I do not think I see myself.

479
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Good night, Ezra.

480
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:52,781
Hello?

481
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:55,956
Ben?

482
00:51:56,603 --> 00:51:58,603
Hi, sorry I call at this hour.

483
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:04,764
He called someone from the treasury?

484
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:08,271
No. Only ...

485
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:13,137
I had some problems with respiraþia
After I removed the Duke for a walk.

486
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:15,154
And I am the keeper.

487
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:17,276
<i> They had to take me
to the hospital with saving. </i>

488
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,936
Sorry.
I do not know why I called.

489
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:25,946
I had your book visits
to me i. ..

490
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:33,175
Ben.

491
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:38,648
- You're there?
- Yes.

492
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:45,281
You ever been thinking about his death, Ben?

493
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:49,759
From time to time.

494
00:52:51,517 --> 00:52:56,761
I was învineþit face.
Not a very good sign.

495
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:02,500
You should rest you.
Trying to sleep.

496
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:06,059
I like to talk to you.

497
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:08,581
<i> Me too. </i>

498
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,408
I tell a story, please?

499
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,663
Well.

500
00:53:23,206 --> 00:53:25,890
Once that never,

501
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:30,197
<i> was named a Baietel ...</i>

502
00:53:30,447 --> 00:53:33,329
How lucky for me,
Keep a backup ...

503
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,845
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.

504
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:45,831
- No, actually, his name was Tim.
- I like the name of Tim.

505
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:49,005
Go.

506
00:53:49,233 --> 00:53:51,791
<i> brother or less
Stresa is always on Tim </i>

507
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:56,034
To make paper airplanes,
because it was very industrious,

508
00:53:57,374 --> 00:54:00,335
Tim visa but more than that.

509
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:03,234
Good. And then?

510
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:10,485
One day, Tim went to court
And you got stuck leaves and branches of arm

511
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040
and he's got to get in oak.

512
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:16,682
<i>His brother  less told,
"Tim, you can not fly!" </i>

513
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,277
<i> And he said, "Follow me me." </i>

514
00:54:20,543 --> 00:54:22,543
He reached the top ...

515
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,416
... and jumped.

516
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:28,578
How big was the tree?

517
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,585
<i> enough.
And a broken arm, man. </i>

518
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,584
God!
What awful story.

519
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:37,676
No, no!
Now comes the part beautiful.

520
00:54:37,677 --> 00:54:42,712
From that experience,
Tim's has realized that he wanted to fly.

521
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:47,254
So he's dedicated to life
spaþiale build ships.

522
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:50,312
Seems that this was a good story.

523
00:54:51,012 --> 00:54:55,098
Yes, e. ..

524
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:00,251
... until occurred dragons.

525
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:05,663
I understand now. Becomes even better.
I like dragons.

526
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:07,754
Especially dragons in space.

527
00:55:08,106 --> 00:55:14,106
And the people were dragons in space
blowing fire and were very bad.

528
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:18,251
I understand ...

529
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:21,803
I have an idea.

530
00:55:21,804 --> 00:55:26,798
<i> What we are trying to sleep,

532
00:55:38,642 --> 00:55:42,837
Thank you think you've heard ...

<i> Try to get some sleep. </i>

534
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:55,131
Good night, Ben.

535
00:55:56,001 --> 00:55:58,001
Good night, Emily.

536
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:06,176
Emily ...

537
00:56:12,881 --> 00:56:14,881
Emily?

538
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,298
I damn mind.

539
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:13,474
I think about dying every day.

<i> Dr Wesley is called Kane in section

541

Hi.

542
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:23,196
When you came here?

543
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:27,703
Last night, after we talked.

544
00:58:29,613 --> 00:58:31,613
Did you sleep here?

545
00:58:33,408 --> 00:58:35,763
Good morning.
How is our patient?

546
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:38,229
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

547
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:41,080
- Hello.
- Hi. Ben, do you? From tax?

548
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:43,188
- Yes, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

549
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:46,041

- No, stay, please do not leave.

550
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:49,151
- May remain.
- Whatever.

551
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,785
You have the keeper's because
your heart was too weak

552

How long do I have?

555
00:59:02,424 --> 00:59:04,424
Depends on your heart.

556
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,604
It could be ...

557
00:59:06,604 --> 00:59:08,604
... six weeks or a month.

558
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,213
But I moved to the state 1B.

559
00:59:13,628 --> 00:59:17,310
- At least I'm on the list.
- Not only that, but ...

560
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,900
You get this and pager.

561

565
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:41,986
- Can I do this from home?
- Once you stabilize, yes.

566
00:59:43,035 --> 00:59:45,035
Good.

00:59:56,024 --> 01:00:00,429
I'm going up to canteens
're bringing something.

568
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:04,835
If you want something,
I'll get something else.

569
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:10,582
You want to stay?

570
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:16,354
That if you something

I have nothing to do.

01:00:43,982 --> 01:00:48,565
- What is that thing?
- It's a dog. Just for one night.

01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:08,248
Let me tell when the rules will be

But you who you are?

Who am I ...

616

Your friend,
Financial inspector.

Ben.

618
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:27,874
How the hell did you come?

619
01:05:30,455 --> 01:05:36,455
- I grew up in Oakland.
- Really ... Well.

620
01:05:39,087 --> 01:05:41,087
Where were you in college?

621
01:05:41,462 --> 01:05:44,809
As far as possible

And now you ask how we got
an embittered by the inspector financially?

Pure and simple I tripped
for this job.

628
01:06:17,379 --> 01:06:19,500
Big obstacles.

629
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:22,937
For what?

630
01:06:24,295 --> 01:06:27,270
I always wanted to become an engineer.

631
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:32,997
Engineer ... That?

632
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:39,347

- Really?

633
01:06:40,281 --> 01:06:44,203
Yes ... I do not want to talk
about me.

634
01:06:45,841 --> 01:06:49,953
Too bad ...
You're very interesting.

No. If tomorrow's questions,
What will happen?

just do it
without leaving crease.

680
01:11:55,907 --> 01:12:01,310
It's the only way that can prove

Well ... So ...
Duke needs a ride.

688
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:44,523
Are you interested?

689
01:12:44,856 --> 01:12:46,856
Yes.

690
01:13:09,076 --> 01:13:12,293
Looks like another dog when you're around.

691
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:15,295
I do not think we
a link to the world.

692
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:20,692
Why did you take a dog so big?

693
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:29,201
I knew it would breed a dog of great Dane
trãie up, on average, and only about seven years?

694
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:33,636
Have a heart problem.

695
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:38,446
I think I got because ...

696
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,848
I thought I could help
with my condition.

697
01:13:41,883 --> 01:13:46,508
I and I take care of something.
Do not be just me out someone.

698
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:55,068
And as you know and you,
it looks very good.

699
01:13:56,559 --> 01:13:59,958
Incredibly well.

- That's it?
- Yes.

701
01:14:11,026 --> 01:14:15,069
I've never felt so
for a very long time.

702
01:14:23,764 --> 01:14:26,421
There are so many things
I want to do.

703
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:32,780
I want to walk 13 hours by plane
and not be stressed by the thought

704
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:35,281
I can not reach a doctor.

705
01:14:37,049 --> 01:14:37,924
To travel.

706
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:41,925
Let's go back to the pack,
I have all kinds of experience ...

707
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:48,339
To see the world. I want to have time
not really tell who I am.

708
01:14:51,798 --> 01:14:54,745
You know? Or what I like ...

709
01:14:56,152 --> 01:14:59,982
I do different, try different ...
May's run and I problems.

710
01:15:03,928 --> 01:15:07,650
I would like very much
to run.

711
01:15:09,024 --> 01:15:14,757
Sometimes I think about it.
How would I run?

712
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:53,379
I therefore ...
See you tomorrow?

713
01:15:55,078 --> 01:15:57,078

720
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:49,193
You're a brave guy.

721
01:20:51,443 --> 01:20:54,162
Since we know on Nicolas?

722
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:05,650

I did a long way, so ...
I gotta go.

812
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:34,947
I do not want to lie to you all.
I do not want ...

813
01:37:38,139 --> 01:37:40,153
Want to play a game?

814

The game "as if ..."...

817
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,152
What if ...

818
01:37:57,342 --> 01:37:59,868
... I would call pager?

819
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:05,698
And I'd find a heart?

820
01:38:06,896 --> 01:38:10,852
And I. .. would work.

821
01:38:12,177 --> 01:38:15,576
And my body would reject it.

822
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,921
And I. ..

823
01:38:23,332 --> 01:38:25,567

01:45:32,549 --> 01:45:37,477
- You can trust him.
- You were at the restaurant?

863
01:45:39,034 --> 01:45:42,036
Goodbye.

864
01:46:02,531 --> 01:46:04,586
<i> 911, the emergency service. </i>

865
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:11,199
I need a ambulanþã.

866
01:46:11,234 --> 01:46:15,367
<i> We located on West Third Street
the number 9212 in Los Angeles. </i>

867
01:46:18,856 --> 01:46:21,583
Yes, the room number 2.

868
01:46:21,617 --> 01:46:24,309
<i>What you  emergency? </i>

869
01:46:26,249 --> 01:46:28,665
There was a suicide.

870
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,082
<i> Who is the victim? </i>

871
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:34,618
Me.

872
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:40,556
- Don 't forget that the ring magazine.
- Why? You're crap?

873
01:46:41,452 --> 01:46:44,510
No, no ... I have given extra money
that's not the guy who carp.

874
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:46,511
I bet ...

875
01:46:46,904 --> 01:46:49,952
- What would you turn your phone?
- I'm sorry. No more work.

876
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:52,387
Almost done.

877
01:49:49,034 --> 01:49:50,047
There are procedures ...

878
01:49:50,048 --> 01:49:53,299
I understand, but she needs a heart that
otherwise going to die!

879
01:50:14,569 --> 01:50:15,307
Ben?

880
01:50:15,307 --> 01:50:18,068
One, two, three ...

881
01:50:31,912 --> 01:50:33,912
How do you feel?

882
01:52:41,384 --> 01:52:44,666
One year after the accident, I was done wrong.
We had ...

883
01:52:45,905 --> 01:52:49,793
I had lung cancer.
I needed a double-lobe transplant.

884
01:52:51,864 --> 01:52:57,214
Tim was able to give me one, of course.
I think it started something ...

885
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,523
After about six months ...

886
01:53:03,831 --> 01:53:07,332
And he donated the right side of the liver
this woman.

887
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,802
Her name Holly.

888
01:55:54,864 --> 01:55:59,302
I'm proud of you.
Very proud. Congratulations.

889
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:03,790

Are you a parent?

891
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:11,329
No.

892
01:56:12,298 --> 01:56:14,551
We know you fear?

893
01:56:19,672 --> 01:56:21,672
Are you okay?

894
01:56:34,952 --> 01:56:37,287
You must be Emily.

895
01:56:43,015 --> 01:56:45,015
Yes.
