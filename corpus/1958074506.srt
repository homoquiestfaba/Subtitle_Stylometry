1
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,333
Help!

2
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,342
To understand how
I found myself in the trunk

3
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:15,433
of this car, you have
to back to my childhood.

4
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
That's pretty Michael.

5
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,233
It is a butterfly.

6
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,266
Very nice.

7
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,667
Isn't that beautiful Hilary.

8
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,600
It's a pine tree.

9
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,667
Lovely.

10
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,900
That's... interesting, Charlotte.

11
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:37,900
It's a pride of lions ripping the
intestines out of a wildebeest.

12
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:45,934
From an early age I
had issues with hostility.

13
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,066
Charlotte, what do you see?

14
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:53,800
A bald eagle shot in
the head with an arrow.

15
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,667
Okay.

16
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,734
What do you see now?

17
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,533
A condemned killer in an electric chair.

18
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:13,333
Charlotte, clearly we have
some things to work on.

19
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:19,100
Okay, tell me about the dream.

20
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm swimming with a family of pythons.

21
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:25,700
Except each one of them is speaking Latin.

22
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,758
And they keep trying to
tell me that they wanna...

23
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,500
The river that we are swimming
on is covered with these...

24
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:34,353
these jelly donuts. But... But I can't

25
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:37,567
understand them
because I don't speak Latin.

26
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:40,967
So I'm thinking, he's
going to love this jelly donut.

27
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:46,000
I reach out, I open his mouth,
I shove it down his throat...

28
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,300
And... He swallows it, and he dies!

29
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,500
And then, I wake up.

30
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,700
You're making this shit up.

31
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,533
My therapist suggested
that I keep a journal.

32
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,266
But, my lack of writing ability
didn't make it too productive.

33
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,834
I love the smell of napalm in the morning!

34
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,567
The baked beans are
five for two ninety nine!

35
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:45,033
The creamed corn is
six for three ninety nine!

36
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,500
And the broccoli is
three for one ninety nine!

37
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:54,000
But only until Wednesday!

38
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,200
Dust every can thoroughly.

39
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:03,767
And make sure that all of the
labels are clean and visible..

40
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,500
Wait!, uh... How much is
the creamed corn again?

41
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:13,166
Oh swell, another brain surgeon.

42
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:18,967
Just read... the price-chart, Dolly!

43
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,100
Yes, Mister Button.

44
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,367
And if you're the one who's been
stealing the cinnamon coffee cake...

45
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:28,533
I'll sling your boney ass!

46
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:34,066
Yes... Mister Button.

47
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,600
That's when it hit me!

48
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,734
The true purpose for my journal.

49
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:57,900
"People... I wish... were dead"

50
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,834
Number one:

51
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,500
Mister... Button!

52
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:14,000
It really did help with my hostility.

53
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,033
So, that was sex?

54
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,967
Shut up! I'm watching
"The Real World of Duluth."

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,934
Number two:

56
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Scott...

57
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,166
How do you spell your last name?

58
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,100
I said, shut up!

59
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:10,700
In college I met my first love: Chad.

60
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,400
What's your name, sweet ass?

61
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,800
Charlotte.

62
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,600
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

63
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,634
You're okay?
-I'm great, yeah.

64
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,033
Initially, the attraction
was purely physical.

65
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,066
Yeah!

66
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,934
Open the jam.

67
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,233
Honey, did you finish Philosophy essay?

68
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,333
Oh yeah.

69
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,000
What about my Econ take home?

70
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,300
Right here.

71
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,900
Nice! Well then I'm done.

72
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,700
Sweet. Thanks for doing that.

73
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,400
You are welcome.
-Love you.

74
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,667
Love you too.

75
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:18,166
After college we moved in together.

76
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,467
Honey, I needed a place
to hang my jersey, so...

77
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,500
I took down the portrait of your
family. You don't mind, do you?

78
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,100
No honey, that's fine.

79
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,467
Chad pursued his dream
of becoming an actor.

80
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:52,500
Pyramix Spray, it soothes
that burning sting of jock itch.

81
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:56,734
Great. Now say it like your
balls are dipped in sulfuric acid.

82
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,800
And I supported him.

83
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,967
Damn it!

84
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:05,734
Son of a bitch!

85
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,433
Global Talent Agency, Mr. Welle's office

86
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
Damn it, Charlene!

87
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,600
This latte is completely foam! please hold.

88
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,700
Uh... It's Charlotte Mister Weller.

89
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:20,073
Now, am I on heroin, or
did I not specifically ask

90
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:23,266
you to significantly
reduce the amount of foam.

91
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,367
Yes, Mister Weller.

92
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:27,970
How can I be expected
to operate effectively

93
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,133
when I'm surrounded by incompetence?

94
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,367
Hello...

95
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,300
Hello?

96
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,100
Number... three.

97
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Did you pay the rent today, honey?

98
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:10,433
Yes, honey.

99
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,800
Did you buy me some of that
raspberry pineapple sherbet?

100
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,367
Honey?

101
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,500
Yes, honey.

102
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:22,100
Well, can I have some please?...Honey.

103
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,367
Yes, honey.

104
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,233
Thank you.

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,834
What?

106
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,700
Here you go. -Thanks baby. Love ya.

107
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,333
Love you too.

108
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,033
These chicks are crazy.

109
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,967
Until Chad got his big break

110
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,533
So, how'd it go?

111
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,634
So... I got it!

112
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh my God!

113
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,266
Can you believe it?

114
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,200
Right?

115
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,233
Doctor Blade Shamrock

116
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,867
He was Doctor Blade Shamrock
on "The Beautiful and the Vain".

117
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:14,200
Mrs. Pontingfrench?

118
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,433
Yes.

119
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,867
I'm afraid your son has
Hyper Tyfectimone syndrome.

120
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:23,467
It's a rare neurological virus that
causes the patient's gender to change

121
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,967
Well, what can I do?

122
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,100
Well, I could consider
buying him a new wardrobe.

123
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,967
I'm truly sorry.

124
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:34,467
Hang in there.

125
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:35,934
Ha? What'd you think?

126
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,367
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

127
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,467
Oh, thanks babe.

128
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,233
Love you.

129
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,033
Love you too.

130
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,266
Oh, that is good.

131
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,400
I think I'll have another
for the good doctor.

132
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,367
Oh yeah.

133
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,967
Soon followed the axe

134
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:07,266
Charlotte...

135
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,500
When two trees are growing side by side.

136
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:15,266
Often times their roots will,
you know... strangle each other.

137
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,166
And in order to save those trees...

138
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:22,133
sometimes park rangers
will up root them and

139
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,667
move them to separate parts of the forest.

140
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:29,500
Now, I think...

141
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:36,133
that you and I could use
some time to grow our roots.

142
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,033
In separate parts of the forest.

143
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,100
Number four...

144
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,800
You know what I'm saying?

145
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:58,000
Here you go!

146
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:58,700
Ohh...

147
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,000
Enjoy your meal!

148
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,400
Can't stop us from having
a nice dinner, though.

149
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,934
Hang on Charlotte

150
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:20,200
And here comes Chad Peterson.

151
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,634
Up this year for his first
daytime soap nomination...

152
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,033
as Blade Shamrock on
"The Young and the Vain."

153
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:37,133
Accompanying Chad is his live in girlfriend
the ravishing super model; Vasheka.

154
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Vasheka?

155
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,467
That's not a name it's an STD.

156
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,300
Rumor has it they're talking marriage.

157
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,266
Mrs. Sheehan!

158
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,667
Would you please shut
that little hair ball up?

159
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,934
Before I put it through my blender
and use it as chum for attracting sharks!

160
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh my Lord!

161
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,867
Don't worry Froot Loops

162
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:27,634
Don't let the angry, lonely, angry lady,
whose hot boyfriend just dumped her...

163
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,200
because he was so far out of
her league, scare you, sweetheart!

164
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,700
Hah.

165
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,200
Ew.. ahh!

166
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:46,700
Ah..

167
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,734
What'cha got here?

168
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,867
"Casablanca"...

169
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:54,567
"Love Story", "When Harry met Sally"

170
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:58,834
If your life were a film, would it
be titled, "Romantic Witness"?

171
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,300
Just give me the DVD's... Wick.

172
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:04,867
Hmmm...

173
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:07,834
What?...wow!

174
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,725
What?

175
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,367
I think you qualify for
our frequent flier program.

176
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,400
Seventy five rentals in one week.

177
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,300
And you get to own your own franchise!...ha

178
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,333
Naw.

179
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,166
Enjoy.

180
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,567
Do you smell poop?

181
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,600
I smell poopy.

182
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:35,646
In other news there was a six point

183
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:38,166
five earthquake centered
today in Hollywood.

184
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,266
And now, on to the weather.

185
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,033
Well, hidy-ho and a hello
out there in toyland, folks.

186
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,400
Our wild, wacky, one day forecast calls
for out Southern California weather...

187
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,916
to drop a whopping
two degrees, from eighty

188
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:53,767
four to eighty two.
Brrr... Back to you, toots.

189
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,467
It's Carlee.

190
00:16:55,533 --> 00:17:00,166
He is such a cheese ball... Right?

191
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:03,200
When it's right, you just know it.

192
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:06,634
Thanks to ConnectYouAndMe.com, we know it.

193
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,233
Forever.

194
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,233
Forever.

195
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,734
Huh.

196
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:25,100
Do you remember my friend
Karen Anderson's daughter, Angie?

197
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,300
Huh... Yes?

198
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:31,934
She just had her... third child!

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,533
And she is two years younger than you.

200
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,333
Umm... Must you catalog
your friend's children's fetuses?

201
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,333
I'm just staring down the gun barrel

202
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
of a grandchild-less old age.

203
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,667
I'm dating! Back off.

204
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,600
Really?

205
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,100
Um-hmm.

206
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,066
Online.
-what?

207
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,300
Are you in the market for some
guy who looks like Danny Devito...

208
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:55,100
who lives in his car
and eats human flesh?

209
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,834
Way to keep an open mind, mom.

210
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,567
Honey, do you have mace?
-No.

211
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,266
Pepper spray?
-No.

212
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,000
Wha... A Taser Gun?
-Mother!

213
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,033
My first Internet date...

214
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,734
wasn't all I'd hoped for.

215
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,734
Oh I need it! there you go.

216
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,567
Oh!, Mom, loves sushi.

217
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:16,834
No, I don't.

218
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,600
She talks about it all the time.

219
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:22,133
They can make the ultimate compact
car, but they can't cook their fish.

220
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,333
She's always trying to eat healthy.

221
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Riddled with parasites.

222
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:29,834
She's never really one to turn
down something new, you know.

223
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,500
I keep looking for a hook.

224
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,000
She's my mom.

225
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,133
That's right dear.

226
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you. You know I still feel
so gosh darn lucky, you know...

227
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,200
'Cause she's my best friend and...

228
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh!, last week we went camping

229
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:44,767
And she had the time of her life.

230
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:49,033
Lost a pint of blood to
mosquitoes and fell off a cliff.

231
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,467
How many guys do you know
who can go camping with their mom?

232
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,233
Not many.

233
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,934
Came within inches of being a paraplegic.

234
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,567
I would have to say that hanging out
with my mom is my favorite thing to do.

235
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,634
Totally!

236
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,300
We just love each other's
company. You know?

237
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:08,567
The rash on my thigh is incurable.

238
00:19:08,634 --> 00:19:11,433
The second date was
an equal disappointment.

239
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,667
Yeee-Haw!

240
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:14,400
Whoo!

241
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:17,300
That is right, baby!, Whoo!

242
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,333
How you like Billy Jean?

243
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,166
Who?

244
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,233
My truck.

245
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,400
I named her Billy Jean.

246
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,800
Ah...

247
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:28,533
Very big, I suppose for this
road, which is... very small!

248
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,967
Oh, Billy Jean can handle any road.

249
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:34,367
She is strong, yet sleek,

250
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:39,266
Powerful, yet sensitive.

251
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,767
Oh... watch this!

252
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:43,634
Whoo-Haah!

253
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,567
Whoo!!

254
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,333
Yeah!

255
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,767
Do you have any Dramamine?

256
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,834
No, why?

257
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:02,467
I was just about to retire from
Internet dating when Lyle showed up.

258
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,667
Charlotte?

259
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,967
Yes?

260
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm Lyle Wilkes.

261
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,834
Yeah?

262
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,767
Not possible.

263
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,333
Pardon me?

264
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,867
This is a hidden camera show, right?

265
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,291
I mean, after I look all happy
to meet you and you leave...

266
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,420
So the real Lyle Wilkes
can show up and he's

267
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:53,800
my fat, drooling junior
high wood shop teacher.

268
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,233
No hidden camera.

269
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
No wood shop.

270
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,767
Charlotte Murphy.

271
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:02,900
Nice to meet you.

272
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,967
Likewise. May I sit?

273
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,734
Please.

274
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,700
So what do you do, Charlotte?

275
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:19,600
Umm, I'm an assistant to a talent agent.

276
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,433
How about you?

277
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,467
Independent contractor.

278
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,734
Oh.

279
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Your table's ready.

280
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,600
I don't want to eat here.

281
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,300
What?

282
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,367
Let's go someplace else.

283
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:36,500
But, you made the reservation.

284
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:38,600
Suddenly I have a better idea.

285
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,200
Ummm...

286
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,934
Do you eat human flesh?

287
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,667
Only when I drink Tequila.

288
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,100
Come on.

289
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,266
We'll be going elsewhere.

290
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,467
Did you know that, ah.. tacos... were
originally invented for horse meat?

291
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:13,900
No, oddly enough I did not know that.

292
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:18,567
In the eighteen hundreds, the Mexican army
used to eat horse meat with every meal.

293
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:21,616
So I guess after a
while it got a little boring,

294
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:24,333
so they invented the
taco, to jazz things up.

295
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,900
If they were eating their horses,
what would the ride into battle?

296
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,900
Why do you think they lost Texas?

297
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,400
Do you like the Huggable Beaver?

298
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:42,867
Is that a sex question?

299
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:48,266
The cartoon: Bilgy, "The Huggable Beaver."

300
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,800
Oh my God!

301
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,500
I love Bilgy!

302
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:54,667
I thought I was the only
person over ten who did.

303
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,133
I did it.

304
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,500
What?

305
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,533
I met my primary life goal.

306
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,533
I found a beautiful woman who loves
the Huggable Beaver as much as I do.

307
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,033
I don't know about
the beautiful part, but...

308
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,567
I am undoubtedly all
about the Huggable Beaver.

309
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:33,166
- Wow, that came out wrong!
- That came out perfect.

310
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,100
Back to the grind.

311
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:57,533
That month, we saw each
other almost every day.

312
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,433
We went to foreign films.

313
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,000
So, what did the duck mean?

314
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,100
I have no idea.

315
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,300
Hey, what about that naked
old guy on the trapeze?

316
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,600
What was that all about?

317
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,433
That one got by me too.

318
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,166
We went to coffee houses.

319
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:21,066
It's all the seer seeing,
but a dream, but a dream.

320
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,533
It's good.

321
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,934
Mmm... Mine too.

322
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
This place is great.

323
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,200
Isn't it?

324
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,233
This place sucks.
-Completely!

325
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,433
What is this? This is coffee my
parents had this every morning.

326
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,667
Goat cheese and caffeine what a combo!

327
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,033
Let's go grab a beer.

328
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,133
I heard that!

329
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,734
And we went hiking!

330
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,634
Beautiful day.
-Oh! -What?

331
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,767
This bush!...it made a rattling sound.

332
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,367
Yeah, you are right. You probably
don't wanna get near that bush, alright?

333
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,100
Let's go over here. You're fine

334
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:33,033
It's not gonna get you as long
you don't jump on it. Let's go.

335
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,934
We meshed.

336
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,066
Don't worry Fruit Loops...

337
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:50,333
they are going to Hell on a jet rocket.

338
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,500
Ooh... these kids!

339
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,300
Wow!

340
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,066
I think I'm going to faint.

341
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,967
It's a good thing you're lying down.

342
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:20,200
So, ahh, what's that motion thing
you were doing with your hips?

343
00:26:20,266 --> 00:26:22,934
Maori Indian mating ritual.

344
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,767
Oh.

345
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:29,533
I saw it on National Geographic.

346
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,266
I love National Geographic.

347
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,934
I'm a lifetime subscriber.

348
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,266
Lucky for me.

349
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,467
Hey.
-Yeah?

350
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,900
I got you something.

351
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:46,467
Oh, my God.

352
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,500
Our pal, Bilgy.

353
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,567
What...

354
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,967
but... It's not my birthday!

355
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:57,333
I know, but I just saw it,
and it made me think of you.

356
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,934
Oh, my God!

357
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,533
But...

358
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,567
But.. I didn't... get you anything.

359
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,900
So, get me something later.

360
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,934
Thank you!

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,100
I love it!

362
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,934
I love it, thank you!
-You're welcome.

363
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:20,600
So... I'm glad to see
you're not a meatloaf.

364
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:25,433
Actually, I met someone
who's... pretty okay.

365
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,867
Really?

366
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:28,767
Uh-hmm

367
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:30,367
Does he live in his car?

368
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,967
Mom... noo!

369
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,734
Does he look like Danny Devito?

370
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,233
Ahh... not in the least!

371
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,266
Oh...

372
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:45,000
So... When do your father
and I get to meet him?

373
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:49,367
Ah... When monkeys colonize Mars.

374
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,734
Okay.

375
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
I'm just gonna go to work, okay?

376
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,567
I'll be back tonight.

377
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll miss you.

378
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,834
Hey there.

379
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,900
You gonna answer that?

380
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:25,233
Wilkes Contracting.

381
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,600
Hi, it's me.

382
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,600
Hey, it's good to hear your voice.

383
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,967
What are you doing?

384
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,734
Ahh!

385
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,066
Going on the tread mill.

386
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:38,667
Oh.

387
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,400
Is this a bad time?

388
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:41,734
Not at all!

389
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,433
Who ever is paying you! I'll double it!!

390
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,533
What was that?

391
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,767
Just the TV.

392
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:50,500
So... I was thinking about you.

393
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,843
So I thought I'd give you a call.

394
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:54,800
Oh, I'm glad you did.

395
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,634
Really?

396
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,834
Absolutely.

397
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,233
I was hoping you'd say that.

398
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,800
Why wouldn't I?

399
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:10,166
I don't know, I thought
I might be bugging you.

400
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,700
Weller's coming!

401
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,066
Umm... I have to put you on hold.

402
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:15,567
Okay!

403
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,967
Hey, are you still there?

404
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,400
Yeah! I'm still here.

405
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:31,934
Wow, you're really getting a workout, huh?

406
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,834
Augh!

407
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,700
Nothing as important as cardio!

408
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,233
Augh!

409
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,100
You really keep that TV loud.

410
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,667
Oh shit, I gotta go!

411
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:51,800
Ahh hmm.

412
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,133
Are you sure?

413
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,367
Ah yeah, I'll see you later tonight, okay?

414
00:30:55,433 --> 00:30:57,133
Augh!

415
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,033
Ahh!

416
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Aahh!!

417
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,734
Augh!

418
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,133
Ahh! Charlotte?

419
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,533
Yeah?

420
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,634
I love you.

421
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,567
Huh?

422
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,133
I love you too.

423
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,967
Aahhh!

424
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,166
I gotta go!...Bye.

425
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,634
Wilkes Contracting.

426
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,433
It's me again. Are you busy?

427
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,967
No, I'm not at all. I
just got off the treadmill.

428
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:26,367
So... when you said love,
did you mean "love," "love"?

429
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,734
Or just love?

430
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm not sure I understand the question.

431
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:33,834
What I mean is, when
you said, "I love you."

432
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,567
Did you say it because was like a
great way to end a phone conversation?

433
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:43,467
Or because you really,
genuinely, for sure, love me?

434
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,600
What are you waiting for?

435
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:50,300
- Well, why did you say it?
- Hey! I asked you first.

436
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:53,634
Charleen!!?

437
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,734
Well, uh... I said it because
I genuinely love you.

438
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,700
And I want to spend my
foreseeable future with you.

439
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:07,567
Get your ass over here! Or you'll
be slinging on whores dot com.

440
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:10,533
Gotta go!...Bye.

441
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,066
Hello? Charlotte?

442
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,433
Come on, lover boy!

443
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,066
Hello?

444
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,133
You don't have the guts!!

445
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,700
Right away!

446
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,867
Wilkes contracting.

447
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:43,533
Am I bugging you yet?

448
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,367
Hey, I was hoping you would call back.

449
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,734
Ahh, Sorry it took me so long.

450
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
My boss is...

451
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,066
my boss.

452
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,066
You're not busy, are you?

453
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,567
No, I'm just tying up some loose ends.

454
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,000
Listen, I'm sorry I left you hanging.

455
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:02,500
It's just... I guess I got a little
scared when you said all those things.

456
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,367
That's understandable.

457
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:07,467
It's just a little soon for me.

458
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,300
Maybe I'm rushing things a little bit.

459
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:12,467
No!...I'm not saying I
didn't like what you said...

460
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:18,500
I did, and I'm not saying I
don't, maybe, feel the same way.

461
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:22,600
Look, I don't want you to feel
obligated to say anything back to me.

462
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:25,266
I just don't want you to
interpret it as a lack of interest.

463
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,698
Or a lack of necessarily feelings, in any

464
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,500
way... I don't want
you to think that at all!

465
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:32,867
Augh!

466
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,667
I gotta go. Bye.

467
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:47,700
Who said I didn't have the guts.

468
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,600
So...

469
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,333
So?

470
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,736
Not happening, Dude!
What?

471
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:29,166
I am not bringing Lyle
over the house for dinner.

472
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,100
No way! no how!

473
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:32,867
Come on now. He is
going to meet us eventually.

474
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:35,800
I mean, especially if you
are getting serious about him.

475
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,200
I told him I'm an orphan.

476
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:46,800
Alright. Okay, now... what can I
do to make it worth your while?

477
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,500
Vote Democrat in every
election for the rest of your life...

478
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:57,066
Donate two percent of your net
worth to Green Peace... and, uhh...

479
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,133
pay my cell phone bill
for the next five years!

480
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,634
What? That is a monstrous asking price!!

481
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Always negotiate from
a position of strength.

482
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,367
Done!

483
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,900
How's the roast chicken, Lyle?

484
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,500
Excellent, Mister Murphy!

485
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,700
Umm..would you like
some more potatoes, Lyle?

486
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:22,533
Yes, please.

487
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,266
You know, there's no butter in them...

488
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,934
Everybody thinks my potatoes are loaded
with butter, But they're not! No, no, no!

489
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,867
I'm sure Lyle doesn't need to know
your secrets for roasting potatoes, mom.

490
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,800
And what are you scared of?

491
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:37,634
Yet another boyfriend dumps you
because your mother doesn't use butter.

492
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,834
Okay, enough!

493
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,433
I'm sorry.

494
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,533
Lyle, Charlotte tells me that you
are... an independent contractor.

495
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,934
That's right.

496
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,033
Well, good work.

497
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,333
I think last summer you had a
job with a construction crew...

498
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,767
Travis. He quit after two days.

499
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,333
Because there were
callouses on his fingers.

500
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,834
You can't be Kurt Cobain with callouses!

501
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,133
Who the fuck is Kurt Cobain?

502
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,667
He's dead.

503
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,467
He's dead!?

504
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:14,533
What good are you when you're dead?

505
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,400
Now he lives in my basement.

506
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,900
I'm just following my dreams, pops!

507
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,634
Don't call me, "Pops".

508
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,500
How many times have I
asked you now to do that?

509
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,967
And the next time you do that,
I'm going to kick your scrawny ass...

510
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:37,333
right outside.

511
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
Touchy! Travis...

512
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,867
Don't!

513
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,166
Don't.

514
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,934
Pops. Oh, Travis!

515
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:56,867
Umm... Ah... More... more potatoes, Lyle?

516
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:01,500
Yes, please.

517
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:04,533
Yes, it's hard to believe
there's no butter in these, isn't it?

518
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,320
You should sell the recipe to a restaurant.

519
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,634
Oh!...no...

520
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,900
I saw Chad on TV, Charlotte.

521
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,433
Shut up, Travis.

522
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,800
Not a bad actor, really.

523
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:16,734
Shut up, Travis!!

524
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,500
You two please, just take it easy, okay?

525
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,834
Dad!

526
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,433
I understand.

527
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,433
Acid reflux.

528
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:34,667
Would you like some
more roasted chicken, Lyle?

529
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:37,100
Absolutely.

530
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:06,567
Spuds, Sis?

531
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,900
Didn't I tell you that online
dating was a great idea?

532
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,066
Actually, you said I'll most
likely wind up with a cannibal.

533
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,700
Lyle is the complete package.

534
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,266
Pretty much.

535
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,767
You should have dated online years ago!

536
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:28,767
You're so right.

537
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:33,333
And he seems so... serious about his work.

538
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,500
Yeah... He doesn't talk about it
much, but I know he works really hard.

539
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:41,900
Well, don't pry! Men do
not like it when women pry.

540
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,567
Good tip, Laura Bush.

541
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:02,467
How is he in bed?

542
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:07,000
Uhh... That question, coming from you...

543
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:12,033
is utterly horrifying on more
levels than I can begin to count.

544
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,700
A pal for Bilgy!

545
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,233
Oh my God...

546
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,033
Oh my God!

547
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,533
You're unbelievable.

548
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,100
You're unbelievable!

549
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,033
God!

550
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:24,300
You're not going to work today, Lyle?

551
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:26,667
I'm taking the morning off.

552
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,900
It's the benefits of self employment.

553
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:32,834
Okay.

554
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,867
Make sure you lock both
locks when you leave, okay?

555
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,634
Got it.

556
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,100
Bye.

557
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:40,934
See you tonight.

558
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,200
Bye.

559
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,533
Charlotte!

560
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:59,400
Come on Fruit Loops, let's
go for our morning poo-poo.

561
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:03,033
Charlotte!
-Ohh! Good God!

562
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,567
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:08,915
Don't worry baby! It is just the angry

564
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:13,066
lady's anonymous,
disease ridden sex partner.

565
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,567
Charlotte!

566
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:20,233
You forgot your purse.

567
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:08,900
Mister Philips!

568
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,233
Mister Button.

569
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,867
Mister Gutherie, your
three o'clock is there.

570
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,600
Hi!

571
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,667
Mister Borders?

572
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,700
Mister Gutherie.
-Please, call me Scott.

573
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:29,734
Scott. -So, looking to buy a house today?

574
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,133
Oh, Mister Weller?

575
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
I didn't have anything in
your book for lunch today.

576
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,066
Yeah, that's right.

577
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:39,066
I don't care if I'm your step brother!

578
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:45,600
I love you like no man could
ever love a non-blood relative.

579
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,600
I understand you can cut
my produce prices in half.

580
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,500
I guarantee it.

581
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:52,700
Guarantee, huh?

582
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,100
Hey!

583
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,800
Get back to the cabbage,
you half brained dimwit!

584
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:01,867
I'll sling your boney ass!

585
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,333
Besieged by incompetence.

586
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,934
I know what you mean.

587
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,367
So, getting back to my produce crisis.

588
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:15,400
I think you could come down to my
facility and check it out for yourself.

589
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:19,000
Great.
-All right.

590
00:44:19,066 --> 00:44:20,467
Yes sir.

591
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,100
Well, you came to the right place.

592
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:23,800
After you.

593
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:25,967
No, no, no! After you.

594
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:28,367
Thank you.

595
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:40,467
So? -So, did you want
me to put something?

596
00:44:40,533 --> 00:44:43,567
Charleen, Charleen, Charleen!

597
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:47,900
My meetings are too important to
be constantly checking in with you

598
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:51,467
like some dim-witted den mother.

599
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,567
It's Charlotte, Mister Weller.

600
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:56,200
I don't care!

601
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:58,634
I happen to have a very
important lunch meeting...

602
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,800
and I chose not to tell you.

603
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,233
Park it where I can see it, Jose.

604
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:18,233
The name's Jimmy, pendejo!

605
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:26,500
Mister Harris.

606
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,867
Mister Weller.

607
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,433
I can't tell you how excited I am...

608
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,266
to have someone of your
reputation interested in this project.

609
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,934
I think it could be big.

610
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,333
Very nice tie.

611
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:54,834
And I will be the father to your child

612
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,500
despite his massive deformities.

613
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,867
I want to be with you...

614
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:04,200
in all four seasons.

615
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,700
Sorry, it's from my soap.

616
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:14,233
It's all I really had time to prepare.

617
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,266
No, no... It was..great.

618
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,900
Oh, well thank you.

619
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,800
You know, I really
haven't done much theater.

620
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:23,333
You know in fact, I
haven't done any theater.

621
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,700
But I know it could help my career.

622
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:29,500
I just wanna be taken
seriously as an actor.

623
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,333
I'm ready to give you the part.

624
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,300
Re.. Really?

625
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:36,033
Oh my God!

626
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,300
Ah...

627
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:38,834
thank you.

628
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
You won't regret it!

629
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,834
I'm sure you're right!

630
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:53,934
Lyle was spending a lot of time at work

631
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,367
and I was about to comfront him about it..

632
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,934
When he came home with tickets to Cabo.

633
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,233
How's your Spanish?

634
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:23,400
Earlier today, super model
Vasheka gave this heartbreaking interview.

635
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:28,333
Chad, if you can her me
I'm sorry that I called you

636
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,767
a no talent, pretty boy trained
chimp, who sounds like chipmunk.

637
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:36,934
You're the only one for me.

638
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,500
Please come back.

639
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:57,767
Charlotte?

640
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,133
Yes, Mister Ward?

641
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,367
I want to start off by
saying how happy I am

642
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:04,934
to be replacing Mister Weller,
and to have you as my assistant.

643
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,667
Thank you Mister Ward.

644
00:49:06,734 --> 00:49:08,800
Call me Josh.

645
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:12,066
I was going to get myself a
mineral water. Would you like one?

646
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,634
Oh, yes please, Mister Ward.

647
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,634
Josh.

648
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,100
Right, Josh.

649
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,033
Chad was reportedly doing
Dinner Theater in Saint Petersburg

650
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,859
Thank you doctor-The
good doctor will be right with you.

651
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:27,834
Okay.

652
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,513
The new guy playing Doctor Blade Shamrock

653
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:33,533
was a shoe in for this
year's daytime award.

654
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Monica, I'm afraid you are
never going to walk again.

655
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:45,467
But Doctor Shamrock, you
said it was just a head cold.

656
00:49:45,533 --> 00:49:47,934
Sadly no.

657
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,367
You have Kiwi disease.

658
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:53,755
It's a rare neurological
virus that tricks you

659
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:57,233
brain into thinking that
your legs are useless.

660
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,667
And that you're from New Zealand.

661
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:05,834
Ohh..I'll have to abandon my dream
of dancing for the Bolshoi Ballet.

662
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,567
And I'll adopt a really annoying accent.

663
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:19,567
The Dingo ate me baby!

664
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,934
Come on Fruit Loops...

665
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,500
Come on little boy.

666
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,133
How was work today?

667
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,000
I made a killing.

668
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:42,400
Hidy ho, and a hello
out there in toyland, folks.

669
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,367
An actual rain drop was
felt today in Van Nuys.

670
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:47,133
Better call out the National Guard.

671
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,700
What a cheese ball.

672
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:53,767
Come on, sweetheart.

673
00:50:53,834 --> 00:50:56,000
Aaah!

674
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,433
Mrs. Sheehan.

675
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,600
Consider this your last warning.

676
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:06,133
If you don't properly train that little
menace to shut its fur ball ass up.

677
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,000
I will feel completely justified in
feeding it to my cousin's boa constrictor!

678
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:15,400
My God! ohh... Don't worry Fruit Loops...

679
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:21,100
The unstable prostitute will
never feed you to a boa constrictor.

680
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:24,433
My little baby.

681
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,333
You what?

682
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,025
Aah!

683
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:28,833
Aah!!

684
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,833
Get lost.

685
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,533
Number... five.

686
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,367
Fruit Loops!

687
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:53,400
Rat, weasel, greasy ball of shit!

688
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:57,500
Ha ha ha! How do you like me now bitch?

689
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,066
Is everything alright?

690
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,767
Umm-hm.

691
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,667
Hidy ho, diddly
do, it is rain, rain, rain.

692
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:13,033
Better keep those Bar-B-Q's
inside, ladies and germs...

693
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,867
Because as my mama used to say...

694
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:17,033
"You can't go out in the
rain with out getting wet."

695
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,400
What the hell...?

696
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,100
Number Six!

697
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:27,033
What's that guy's name again?

698
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,433
Umm.. Billy Joe... something.

699
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,800
Hey pooch

700
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,600
Want a biscuit?

701
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,800
Two points.

702
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,066
I'm like talking Ferrari.

703
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:29,166
Excuse me, but umm...

704
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:33,867
didn't I see you two in the Hawaiian
Tropic bikini contest?..in Maui?

705
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,900
I'm Billy Joe Philbin.

706
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:41,433
I do the weather on channel
eight. You've seen me.

707
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,400
Can you believe this guy?

708
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:45,867
Are you and I going to
sleep with him, or just bolt?

709
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:48,333
Let's get out of here.

710
00:53:50,266 --> 00:53:51,834
What a cheese ball!

711
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,533
Fat old cheese ball.

712
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,700
- Dykes!
- Hi, a Harvey on the rocks please. Thanks.

713
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:02,166
Hi there.

714
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:03,233
Hello.

715
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,367
Did you ever dated a weather man?

716
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,634
Say... didn't I see you in the Hawaiian
Tropic Bikini Competition in Maui?

717
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,300
Excuse me little lady... But ah...

718
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:42,967
didn't I see you in the Hawaiian
Tropic Bikini Competition in Maui?

719
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,867
Aren't you Billy Joe Philbin?

720
00:54:44,934 --> 00:54:47,000
That's right.

721
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,166
My wife and I watch you every night.

722
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,567
Oh! thanks. Thanks a lot.

723
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:53,200
Have you ever acted in movies?

724
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:56,700
No, but..uh, I've been asked.

725
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,600
I run a small production company
and we have a role coming up...

726
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,967
that I think would be perfect for you!

727
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:03,041
Really?

728
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:06,233
Look, if you're
interested... give me a call.

729
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,266
Alright, ah..thanks! Thanks a lot!

730
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,000
Hopefully I'll see you soon.
-Yeah.

731
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,500
You said sixty percent chance of rain...

732
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,433
Clear as a bell.

733
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,066
Lyle and I decided it
was time to cohabitate.

734
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:47,433
Can I be part of the family?

735
00:55:48,133 --> 00:55:49,767
Oh my God.

736
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,834
Oh my God!

737
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,400
Thank you.

738
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,533
Lyle, dinner's ready!

739
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,967
I'll be right there!

740
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,367
So, when am I going to be able
to see your brother's band play?

741
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,233
Ha ha ha!

742
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,400
Yeah, right.

743
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:41,300
Do these potatoes have any butter
in them? Because they are good.

744
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,867
Hey! They are good.

745
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,100
Hey! They are good.

746
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,900
It's a family recipe here.

747
00:56:50,634 --> 00:56:52,934
Have you ever wondered
what the world would be like...

748
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,667
if all the meat eating
animals ate vegetables

749
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:59,767
and all the vegetable-eating
animals ate meat?

750
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,400
No, I've never wondered that.

751
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:04,700
Well, think about it.

752
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,867
Everybody would be running
from wild blood thirsty cows.

753
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:10,767
And from savage saber tooth horses.

754
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:13,008
You couldn't walk out
of the front door because

755
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,266
of all the carnivorous
chipmunks and squirrels.

756
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:17,800
It would be complete bedlam.

757
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,533
I tend to worry about really weird things.

758
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,800
Like, getting hit by a bus.

759
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:30,934
Or getting caught on the freeway
in a nine point 0 earthquake.

760
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,567
That'll never happen.

761
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:37,843
You know that inversion layer
we were talking about the other day

762
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:39,333
is actually going to pass over us...

763
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,610
but that's still going to mean
that we are going to have...

764
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:43,233
very calmed subtle temperatures...

765
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,400
This new guy is so much better.

766
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:48,834
I miss the old one.

767
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:59,800
It's quieter since that
canine rat ran away.

768
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,233
Yeah.

769
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,567
Yeah.

770
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:10,867
Our lives became fairly pedestrian:

771
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:15,333
During the day I would go to my job...

772
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,734
and Lyle would go to his.

773
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:25,567
The nights, we spent together.

774
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:27,333
Hey, Lyle?
-Yeah.

775
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,409
What's that?
-What's what?

776
00:58:28,433 --> 00:58:29,433
It looks like blood.

777
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,634
Where?

778
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah, right there, behind your ear.

779
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,200
Huh.

780
00:58:34,266 --> 00:58:35,667
Did you cut yourself?

781
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:38,100
I don't think so...

782
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,066
You know what? It is probably
from that mosquito that I swatted.

783
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,333
I'll go wash it off.

784
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,433
Hey...
-Yeah?

785
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,700
Not now.
-Not now?

786
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:53,800
Okay, here we are.

787
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:06,934
Hey, Lyle?

788
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,133
Yeah?

789
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,233
Who is that?

790
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,800
Oh, that's a guy I work with.

791
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,667
He's trying to be an actor.

792
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:15,967
Really? Does he think you can help him?

793
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,467
No, no... he was just giving
us all a copy of his head shot.

794
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:21,800
It was actually kind of a joke.

795
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:24,333
Come on, let's eat.

796
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,033
You're gonna love this place.

797
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:35,200
Oh, Godfather Three.

798
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:38,400
Is that the one where the dumb
son gets drowned in the lake?

799
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:40,166
That's number two.

800
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:43,433
Oh, is that the one where the fat
guy gets a knife through his hand?

801
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,767
One.

802
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,867
I don't remember three.

803
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:50,233
They pulled me back in!

804
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,634
Oh yeah!

805
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,500
No.
-No? -hu-humm

806
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:54,667
Okay.

807
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,900
Alien three.

808
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,266
There's too many bald people in that.

809
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:12,233
Thelma and Louise.

810
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,367
Umm.. too chick.

811
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:17,033
Too...? okay!

812
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,767
Terminator!

813
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:29,700
Perfect!...Come on.

814
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:33,066
Thanks a lot. Have them back Wednesday.

815
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:36,500
Oh, thank God.

816
01:00:36,567 --> 01:00:39,333
We can stay in business.

817
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,900
Hi ya, Wick.

818
01:00:41,967 --> 01:00:46,634
I see somebody discovered
stud service dot com.

819
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,967
Chop chop, dick.

820
01:00:49,033 --> 01:00:50,900
I mean, Wick.

821
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:53,600
Oh...

822
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,467
I am so sorry.

823
01:00:55,533 --> 01:01:01,233
I am squandering your valuable
time, eye locked to the idiot tube.

824
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,900
How can I atone? How?

825
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,867
Terminator.

826
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:10,100
Someone's got a well
of unused testosterone.

827
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,200
Just give us the DVD, friend.

828
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:15,266
Friend?

829
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,133
You know, I love the smell of
re-channeled homosexuality.

830
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,700
Are you picturing me in a
mini skirt? You are aren't you.

831
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,967
Huh? Did I shave? You
want to know, don't you?

832
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:31,700
That's it! I was nice before, but no more.

833
01:01:31,767 --> 01:01:33,767
You've made the grade now, buddy.

834
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,166
Number seven.

835
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:37,400
Oh, I'm number one.

836
01:01:37,467 --> 01:01:39,000
Wick.

837
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,567
Smart ass...

838
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:41,867
little

839
01:01:41,934 --> 01:01:42,967
video

840
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,266
store

841
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,300
pissant

842
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,800
You got fangs.

843
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:49,500
That ought to do it.

844
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:50,667
I'm scared.

845
01:01:50,734 --> 01:01:52,266
I'm scared.

846
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,400
I'll see you soon.

847
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,734
Next!

848
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,367
You love popcorn and stuff?

849
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:01,300
I love pop corn!

850
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:02,367
I do too!

851
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:07,467
Jesus! that douche!

852
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:09,567
He always takes my space!

853
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:12,667
That's my space!

854
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,600
Number eight...

855
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,433
the owner..

856
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,266
Of this piece... of shit... car.

857
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:30,967
Hah!

858
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,767
Why don't you just park out front?

859
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,033
Fine.

860
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:07,200
Whoa! What the hell?! Hey ass wipe!

861
01:03:07,266 --> 01:03:08,567
Move it!

862
01:03:08,634 --> 01:03:10,266
Me?

863
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,266
Sorry.

864
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,734
One word: deodorant...

865
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,266
Ahh!

866
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,967
Uhh, Jeez!

867
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,900
And stay tuned for eye
witness news at 6PM tonight

868
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:57,900
when we have an exclusive interview with

869
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,300
the first man to eve give birth to twins.

870
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:01,807
And now onto the weather with Craig.

871
01:04:01,834 --> 01:04:02,700
Craig?

872
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:03,900
Thank you, Carlee.

873
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:05,934
Carlee, you know that low pressure system

874
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,857
we were talking about
earlier today is actually

875
01:04:07,899 --> 01:04:09,600
going to be out by the end of the morning.

876
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,066
A hundred percent better.

877
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:13,567
Which is going to give
us a beautiful afternoon.

878
01:04:13,634 --> 01:04:16,251
And all know, a beautiful
afternoon means you have

879
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:18,900
to do something challenging,
something rewarding.

880
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:21,533
So how about if you and I go sky diving?

881
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,867
Well, that would be wonderful,
Craig. I am off at noon, so...

882
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:37,300
How about if we bungee jump out
of the plane while we're sky diving?

883
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:39,600
It could have been yours, Chad.

884
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:43,000
And you know what, I did some research
and your name, Carlee in English means

885
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:44,634
Petite and womanly...

886
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,200
But in my culture, in my culture
your name actually stands for

887
01:04:48,266 --> 01:04:50,133
the cherry blossoms are blooming.

888
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,634
Oh wow. Thanks, Craig.

889
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,567
Ties to organized crime?

890
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,233
Presumed dead.

891
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,033
Lyle, who's that?

892
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh, that's a guy I work with.

893
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:19,100
He's trying to be an actor.

894
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:26,734
Fruit Loops!?

895
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,367
Where's my little poo-poo?

896
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,667
Come here boy!

897
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:34,634
Fruit Loops, where are you?!

898
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:48,266
Oh, God...

899
01:06:30,433 --> 01:06:32,700
last night he was on my death list.

900
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:35,500
This morning... he is dead.

901
01:06:35,567 --> 01:06:40,333
Only once in my life had I
received this kind of a shock...

902
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,333
What do you think about Kenny Wales?

903
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,934
Charlotte...

904
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,233
Yeah?

905
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,166
Would you kiss me... with tongue?

906
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,567
Charlotte?

907
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,000
So, I don't understand.

908
01:07:24,066 --> 01:07:26,834
He worked here for like..sixteen years.

909
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,166
Where is he?

910
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:30,233
- I... I don't know.
- So you don't talk to him?

911
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,800
No... No one has seen
or heard a thing from him.

912
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,000
Really?
-Yeah!

913
01:07:35,066 --> 01:07:39,066
His wife... said he had gambling debts.

914
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:44,467
To tell you the truth, it's been a lot
calmer around here since he's left.

915
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:50,767
Thank you.

916
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:53,667
He completely disappeared!
He didn't say anything to anybody

917
01:07:53,734 --> 01:07:57,600
Management found out he
was stealing the office supplies.

918
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:02,333
Oh sweety, you are better off without him.

919
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,900
You know what makes me
feel better when I'm upset?

920
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:06,734
A new house.

921
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,700
This one just opened on the market.

922
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:10,800
Do you want to call me?

923
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:18,600
Never talked about his work.

924
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:21,600
He never invited me to his office.

925
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:26,567
I bought him stuffed animals,
and he made my journal come true.

926
01:08:41,834 --> 01:08:45,100
So your boyfriend killed
all of these people...

927
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,333
After you said you wanted to kill them.

928
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,800
No! I didn't want to kill them.

929
01:08:49,867 --> 01:08:52,767
Look, I was angry and I
have issues with hostility.

930
01:08:52,834 --> 01:08:55,266
So my psychologist
suggested that I write a journal.

931
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,743
And then all these things started...

932
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:58,876
Did you tell your boyfriend
that you wanted to kill them?

933
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,700
No!! I didn't wanna kill them!

934
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:04,867
Look!

935
01:09:04,934 --> 01:09:07,967
I think he is a hit man.

936
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:11,834
And he thought he was doing
me some sort of favor. Ohh...

937
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,800
A hit man?

938
01:09:13,867 --> 01:09:16,100
I'm pretty sure killed that
volleyball promoter guy.

939
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,600
And why would you think that?

940
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,333
Because he had a picture of him in his car.

941
01:09:21,634 --> 01:09:22,634
And!

942
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,634
He never talks about his work.

943
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,834
And I've never been to his office.

944
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,567
And he's even got
Wick's body in his trunk!!

945
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:31,667
Wick? Wick?

946
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,867
Uh!...Number seven!

947
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,700
Let's go!!

948
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,634
If we don't go we'll never get rid of her.

949
01:09:55,867 --> 01:09:57,500
We're here.

950
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,567
Alright, show us.

951
01:10:00,634 --> 01:10:02,367
You'll see.

952
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:05,367
Ha!

953
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,734
Uhh!...He's gone!

954
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,433
Wick... Wick's gone!

955
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,600
I'm guessing you're a fan
of hallucinogenic drugs.

956
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:18,767
There was a dead video
store employee in that trunk!!

957
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,567
If you say so, sweetheart.

958
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:27,333
It was on twitter.

959
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:30,467
Let's get out of here!

960
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,503
So we're thinking of having a 4th of
July picnic and you should bring Lyle.

961
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:41,325
Mom...

962
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:44,667
When is Lyle's birthday? 'Cause your
father and I wanna get him something

963
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:45,534
Mom!

964
01:10:45,576 --> 01:10:48,100
Like a leather jacket, hiking
boots, nothing too over...

965
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:50,367
Lyle... is a killer.

966
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:52,233
Ha ha!, Like a lady killer?

967
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,166
No, like a...

968
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:56,867
killer, killer!

969
01:10:56,934 --> 01:10:58,233
Honey, I'm not following.

970
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,066
He... murders people!

971
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:02,100
Professionally.

972
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,467
Still lost here.

973
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,266
My boyfriend is a hit man!!

974
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,400
Oh my God!

975
01:11:08,467 --> 01:11:11,667
Umm... She's joking. Umm.. Really.

976
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,233
You're so funny!

977
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,400
Wh... What? A hit man!!?

978
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:19,000
Independent Contractor?

979
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,133
It's a code! he's... Jason Bourne!

980
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,200
Oh!

981
01:11:24,266 --> 01:11:26,066
Well!

982
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:30,033
Honey, you know sometimes you
have to take the good with the bad.

983
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,634
Excuse me?

984
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,900
When you father and I were first married.

985
01:11:33,967 --> 01:11:36,767
He used to like to put a
cucumber in his underwear.

986
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:40,233
What?! -I know! I used to hate it, but...

987
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,500
you know, I loved him! So I got used to it.

988
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:48,734
Ok, umm... As frightening
as the visual of Dad

989
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,934
with a cucumber in his underwear is...

990
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,300
and I am certain I will never be
able to fully get that out of my head...

991
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,934
How is that in the least bit relevant
to the fact that the man I'm living with...

992
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,667
is a mass murderer!!!

993
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:05,834
Honey, because true
love requires sacrifice.

994
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:12,600
I've died and gone to Hell.

995
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:15,066
Oh, honey...

996
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:17,033
Oh! your hair looks nice today!

997
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,800
The only solution was to catch Lyle myself.

998
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:55,300
How was your day, Lyle?

999
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:56,934
Oh, not so special.

1000
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,667
Poured a couple of foundation,
committed a couple of homicides.

1001
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:02,242
Oh, and I closed a sale on that
twelve unit condominium complex.

1002
01:14:02,266 --> 01:14:05,033
Run that one by me again!...?

1003
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:19,200
So how is your friend's acting going?

1004
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,567
Huh?

1005
01:14:20,634 --> 01:14:22,634
Your friend, whose... head,

1006
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,634
I mean head shot! I found
in the back of your car.

1007
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:31,367
Oh, him! Dave.

1008
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,367
Dave?

1009
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:34,533
Yeah, Dave.

1010
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,266
How's his acting?

1011
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:41,266
He gave it up. He's now counseling
runaways teenagers in Myanmar.

1012
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,000
Myanmar?
-Yeah!

1013
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:46,800
Apparently the teenage runaway
problem there is quite rampant.

1014
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:49,433
Huh!

1015
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:55,233
So... I was thinking you might try
help Mrs. Sheehan find her dog.

1016
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,100
That would be neighborly.

1017
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:59,000
What do you think could
have happened to him?

1018
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:03,233
Little critter like that, he could
crawled under the heater and suffocated.

1019
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,033
So he's dead?

1020
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,500
Could be living in a dumpster,
feeding on slow moving insects.

1021
01:15:10,567 --> 01:15:13,066
Hmm.. Ha, ha.

1022
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:25,166
This is good, Honey. Very good.

1023
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,233
Yummy.

1024
01:15:51,867 --> 01:15:55,634
Where are you going Lyle?

1025
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,166
Is that where you get your guns?

1026
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:03,800
Ah! Is that where you
find your next target?

1027
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:06,967
What do you get in there?

1028
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:12,634
Ice cream!?

1029
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,734
Keep your pants on!

1030
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:25,533
No! get out of the way!

1031
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,934
Get, get, out of the way!

1032
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,634
Shit!

1033
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:31,634
Hey!
-Ahhhh!

1034
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,634
Hi! Hi!

1035
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,600
Ahh...

1036
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,367
What are you doing here?

1037
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,033
Uhh...

1038
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,233
Picking up my bosses's cleaning.

1039
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,834
He gets his dry cleaning
done all the way down here?

1040
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,600
Oh yeah!...He loves this place!

1041
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:52,433
Hmm... Haa..

1042
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,600
What's with the video camera?

1043
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:55,900
Ah, this?

1044
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:58,600
Oh, he likes me to video tape...

1045
01:16:58,667 --> 01:16:59,967
the cleaners!

1046
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,367
To make sure they don't
switch up his clothes!

1047
01:17:02,433 --> 01:17:05,066
He's really paranoid about it.

1048
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,166
I guess so.

1049
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:18,867
I hate this singer.

1050
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,967
Really?

1051
01:17:21,033 --> 01:17:24,266
Well! not hate, hate...

1052
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:25,767
It's not a personal thing.

1053
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:27,576
It's just, I don't really
care for his music.

1054
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,934
It's not like I would put him
in my journal, or anything!

1055
01:17:31,066 --> 01:17:33,200
Ah.. Okay.

1056
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:40,400
Hey! This is a legal parking space.

1057
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:51,266
Ahh... No, no. No. Yeah, I am
in the way. You're right, my bad!!

1058
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,266
Did your boss get his cleaning?

1059
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:00,000
What?

1060
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:03,233
Your boss, did he get his cleaning?

1061
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,100
Oh, yeah.

1062
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:07,433
He did, thank you.

1063
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,033
And the video?

1064
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,600
Oh yeah, he got that too.

1065
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:17,667
Over demanding bosses...

1066
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:21,800
sometimes you just want to shoot
them in the head, and bury them in a ditch.

1067
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:34,867
Your mother called.

1068
01:18:34,934 --> 01:18:36,667
Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

1069
01:18:36,734 --> 01:18:39,734
Said your brother was missing.

1070
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,600
My brother?

1071
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:45,433
Yeah. And then she called right back
and said he was just out with his band.

1072
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,867
Ohh... Yeah, he's a, wild man.

1073
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,166
Charlotte?

1074
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,967
Yeah?

1075
01:19:04,033 --> 01:19:06,500
I think it's time I come clean.

1076
01:19:06,567 --> 01:19:09,200
About what?

1077
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:11,367
Everything.

1078
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:14,100
What is it, Lyle?

1079
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,834
It's big.

1080
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,333
You can tell me.

1081
01:19:34,834 --> 01:19:37,867
Will you marry me?

1082
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:40,300
Will you be my wife?

1083
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:41,567
Ahh...

1084
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:43,400
I love you.

1085
01:19:43,467 --> 01:19:45,700
I know you love me.

1086
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:46,533
Ahh...

1087
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,834
Be my wife, Charlotte.

1088
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,100
No.

1089
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:51,000
No?

1090
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:51,758
No.

1091
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,867
No?

1092
01:19:52,934 --> 01:19:55,500
You're not going to kill me, are you?

1093
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:57,567
It's an option.

1094
01:19:57,633 --> 01:19:59,034
We can't get married, Lyle.

1095
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,567
We're totally different. You
kill people. I just hate them.

1096
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,233
You're talking about my work.

1097
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,634
Your work?

1098
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,166
Yeah. You know...

1099
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,967
My work.

1100
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:22,533
I shot Kennedy. I confess!

1101
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
You're a hit man, aren't you?

1102
01:20:24,667 --> 01:20:28,100
See now, I prefer mortality consultant.

1103
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:30,934
Where did you put the bodies?

1104
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,333
Normally that's very
privileged information.

1105
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,433
But, seeing on how we're living together...

1106
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,467
I'll show you.

1107
01:20:39,533 --> 01:20:41,266
Show me?
-Yeah, it'll be fun!

1108
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:43,533
I would rather not.
-Oh, come on.

1109
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,200
Actually, my mom called, we
are gonna go for coffee together.

1110
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:49,800
- I am fairly positive, you may enjoy this.
- Nah.

1111
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,100
Hello

1112
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:10,634
Mmmm! mmm!

1113
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,810
See now, this is going to help
you better empathize with the

1114
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:15,300
individuals that we're gonna go see.

1115
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:18,166
It's going to make the
experience that much richer.

1116
01:21:18,233 --> 01:21:20,634
Shhh.. This is tough stuff.

1117
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,433
Struggling against duct tape...

1118
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,233
only makes it tighter. Okay?
So you can do what you want, but

1119
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,500
I wouldn't do that if I
were you, but it's your call.

1120
01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:36,800
I'm not sure you are going to enjoy
this experience like I thought you would.

1121
01:21:36,867 --> 01:21:40,367
Oh well, anyway, it will be fine.

1122
01:21:40,433 --> 01:21:43,233
What, have you been working out, girl?

1123
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:50,500
And that's how I got myself
into the trunk of this car.

1124
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:53,100
Help!

1125
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,133
Ahhhh!

1126
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,967
Ahhhh!!

1127
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,367
No one can hear you.

1128
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,133
Ahhhh!

1129
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,934
Now you're just startling
the wild life, Charlotte.

1130
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,600
Where are we?

1131
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:31,000
Somewhere in the valley, I think.

1132
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:34,033
The bodies, they're all here?

1133
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:36,400
Affirmative.

1134
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:37,500
Where?

1135
01:22:37,567 --> 01:22:38,634
Where?

1136
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:42,800
You're standing on Mister Button.

1137
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:45,367
Ahhh! Mister Button?

1138
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:49,567
Yeah. That tiny spot right there
is that annoying little rat-dog

1139
01:22:49,634 --> 01:22:51,400
Fruit Loops?

1140
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,567
I think so.

1141
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,400
It is hard to keep that
little varmint straight.

1142
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,700
The others, they are all here?

1143
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:03,133
Yeah, your whole journal.

1144
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,066
Cheesy weatherman is right there.

1145
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:08,600
Over there is Wick.

1146
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:12,300
There, is uh... Chad and Scott.

1147
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:14,600
And right there is your old boss.

1148
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,133
And then a few of my professional
clients are mixed in with them.

1149
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:25,200
So, homicide is in fact your profession.

1150
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,767
It's more of a calling, really.

1151
01:23:27,834 --> 01:23:30,900
How could you do that?

1152
01:23:30,967 --> 01:23:33,033
What... You mean did I go to school for it?

1153
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:39,066
No. I mean, how can you make the
taking of human life your profession?

1154
01:23:39,133 --> 01:23:40,967
How does anyone chose a profession, really?

1155
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,867
I mean, what makes a professional wrestler?

1156
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:45,834
What makes a professional bird watcher?

1157
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,066
What makes a professional vegetable taster?

1158
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:50,100
Who knows how these
things sort themselves out?

1159
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,600
Okay, bird watching isn't a profession.

1160
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,767
Why not?

1161
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:57,233
It's more of a hobby.

1162
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,934
The Audubon Society is
professional bird watchers.

1163
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,600
No, they're volunteers.

1164
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:04,367
Get down on your knees.

1165
01:24:04,433 --> 01:24:06,467
Excuse me?

1166
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,100
My instructions were not ambiguous.

1167
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:11,233
Why do you want me to get down on my knees?

1168
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,600
No.

1169
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,066
I'm a Buddhist.

1170
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:18,767
You're going to kill me.

1171
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:19,900
Yep.

1172
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,734
But I thought you loved me.

1173
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,600
Hey, I do love you.

1174
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:27,066
But I'm not going to go to prison for you.

1175
01:24:27,133 --> 01:24:30,934
- My love has boundaries.
- But I'm not going to send you to prison.

1176
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,884
Oh, so those cops you
were talking to, they're

1177
01:24:32,926 --> 01:24:34,934
helping you with the
neighborhood watch program?

1178
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,634
You know about them?

1179
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,100
Yeah.

1180
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:40,734
Well, I got scared.

1181
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,400
What do you want, when you find
out your boyfriend is a serial killer?

1182
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:47,266
Maybe a little bit of gratitude.

1183
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,533
You know maybe... "Thank you, Lyle."

1184
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,867
Thank you for making
all my dreams come true.

1185
01:24:53,934 --> 01:24:59,433
Thank you for wasting all those horrible,
evil people who ever did me wrong.

1186
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:03,066
Well, when you put it that way...

1187
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,467
No!
-Down -Please!

1188
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,533
Any final words?

1189
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,033
My mind's a blank.

1190
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:20,066
You could say, uh...

1191
01:25:20,133 --> 01:25:23,266
"Please forgive me God for all my sins."

1192
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,066
but I'm not Catholic.

1193
01:25:26,133 --> 01:25:28,567
I'm not going to tell anybody.

1194
01:25:28,634 --> 01:25:31,600
Okay, okay!

1195
01:25:34,934 --> 01:25:36,934
God...

1196
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You know, I tried to be a good person.

1197
01:25:41,066 --> 01:25:42,867
But, ah...

1198
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:46,467
If I'm being totally honest, which...

1199
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:50,667
I'm pretty sure is a large
component of praying, then ahh...

1200
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:54,433
I'm kind of glad the
cheesy weatherman is dead.

1201
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,634
And, since you're God, all
powerful and all that, then

1202
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:00,266
lying to you is pretty much fruitless.

1203
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:02,700
So I must admit...

1204
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:07,066
that I'm happy about the prick,
who took my virginity being dead too!

1205
01:26:07,133 --> 01:26:09,867
And let's face it...

1206
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:14,166
That asshole, Mister
Button... did not deserve to live.

1207
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:19,567
I mean, come on! Mister
Mister Weller, good riddance.

1208
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:22,233
Fruit Loops, bark in the afterlife!

1209
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,300
Ruff! Ruff!

1210
01:26:24,367 --> 01:26:27,567
Wick! See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya!

1211
01:26:27,634 --> 01:26:30,834
And that prick who always
took my parking space?

1212
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,567
Happy trails!

1213
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,533
My wish list wasn't hypothetical.

1214
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,333
I genuinely wanted all of them croaked.

1215
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,567
Every single one.

1216
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:52,367
Which could only mean that...

1217
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:10,800
Babe, will you get the phone?

1218
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:12,333
Yeah.

1219
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,867
Wilkes Contracting.

1220
01:27:23,934 --> 01:27:25,734
Oh hi, Mom!

1221
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,200
Well umm...

1222
01:27:29,266 --> 01:27:31,934
If it's a girl we're thinking, "Phoebe".

1223
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,867
If it's a boy, we like "Shane".

1224
01:27:33,934 --> 01:27:35,367
Lyle Junior.

1225
01:27:35,433 --> 01:27:38,800
Oh, correction, "Lyle Junior."

1226
01:27:40,867 --> 01:27:46,734
I'm good. How is dad?
Is he still going crazy?

1227
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,533
Yeah, things are...
Things are really good.
