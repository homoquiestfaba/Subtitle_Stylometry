1
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm very, very tired.

2
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,479
I would like one very, very quiet room.

3
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,405
Is that for a very, very quiet room?

4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,826
All right. If you say so.

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,415
A witch's brew for me and you
With goblin poo and pig slop goo

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,753
A hotel guest?

7
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,506
To serve and uphold
the comfort of each guest.

8
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,426
To strive for perfection in guest hospitality.

9
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,304
These are the bylaws of
the Hotel Transylvania

10
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:39,933
as written by its manager and founder,
Count Dracula.

11
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,605
Pardon me, your guest—ship.

12
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,149
But will you be needing anything?

13
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:57,618
The poor dear,
all tuckered out like a wee baby.

14
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,126
What a horrible draft.

15
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
He'll surely catch death of a cold.

16
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,513
Hey, broom. Broom.

17
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,267
Hey, broom. Hey!

18
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,730
That spider will wake him for sure.

19
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,362
You're dead, pesky noisemaker.
