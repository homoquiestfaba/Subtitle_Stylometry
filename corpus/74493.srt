1
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,748
All right, hold it up.
Hold the music. Hold everything.

2
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,085
Hold everything.
Let's have a line over here.

3
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,681
Make it two lines...

4
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,658
one for the men
and one for the women.

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,493
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Don't be bashful.

6
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,555
You don't want
to dance with me?

7
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,828
No?

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,871
Thanks a lot. OK, OK.

9
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,202
You always gotta go somewhere,
and you start with the basics...

10
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,504
so you can always come back
to them, right? OK?

11
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,441
Hey, Stella, come here, baby.

12
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,036
Frankie, come on, baby.
Let's do it.

13
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,776
This is Stella.
You know her, right?

14
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,341
She's the star
of the place here.

15
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,354
And I just want to say that
your last class was wonderful...

16
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,050
but this time, I want it
to look a little more New York.

17
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,093
So I want you to use the floor
and bring it down.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,027
- Brooklyn style.
- A little less up, more down.

19
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,066
All right, let's concentrate
on the basics now.

20
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,259
Let's go.

21
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,598
And one, two, three,
one, two, three...

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,501
back step.

23
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,267
That's nice.

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,434
See how she holds the beat?
She doesn't rush it.

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,070
Get the rhythm goin'.

26
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,341
Don't rush it, see?

27
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,815
OK, you ready? It's you and me.
Ready? Come on.

28
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,876
- Maybe later.
- What do you mean, later?

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,114
Later.

30
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,088
- What, are you shy or something?
- No.

31
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,818
I don't want to sit here
all night.

32
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,156
- Then don't.
- Then don't?

33
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,196
- OK, I'll go dance.
- OK, go.

34
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,824
OK, go? OK, I'm gonna get
somebody to dance with you then.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,267
One of those guys.
Hey, young fella. Young fella.

36
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,965
Hey, hey. Hey, shorty.

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,768
Shorty.

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,940
You don't want
to dance with him?

39
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,377
Here you go, pumpkin.

40
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,510
Look at that.

42
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,178
All right,
give us a smoother step.

43
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,985
Slide. Slide. You're pickin' up
your feet too much.

44
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,685
That's right. They pick up
their feet too much.

45
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,694
Who's the best dancer
out there?

46
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,992
- Stella.
- Stella? She's terrific.

47
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,158
Oh, yeah. You're lookin'
a little bit more like Frankie.

48
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,963
Come on, little children.
What are you doin' over there?

49
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,867
Come on, let's go.

50
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,465
Yeah, OK. Hey, don't you want
to do a little swing?

51
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,100
A little... a little swing?

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,202
- You want to?
- Yeah, you know...

53
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,974
- OK.
- OK.

54
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,481
But don't you get fancy on me,
all right?

55
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,347
OK. Remember what I taught you?

56
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,908
Let's go, you two.

57
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,283
Let's go.

58
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,845
These people dance
like I play polo.

59
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,017
John J. Is here
with his daughter tonight.

60
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,117
No, he said that's
his girlfriend's little girl.

61
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,220
- She's a cute kid.
- Yeah, that's his daughter.

62
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,026
I wouldn't want to be the guy
that goes out with her...

63
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,998
when she gets older,
I'll tell you that.

64
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,126
- You'd have to bob and weave.
- Worse than that.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,899
Can I have a dance
for your birthday?

66
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,167
I will,
but you better be there.

67
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,868
Yeah? Or what?

68
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,844
- Or else.
- Or else.

69
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,377
- What'd you learn in school?
- I did the math...

70
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,579
with the two digits
on the outside.

71
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,622
- What kind of math?
- Decimals.

72
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,214
- Oh, my God.
- And division.

73
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,259
I forgot that long ago.

74
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,454
I bet you forgot
your steps, though.

75
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,191
I forget the decimals,
you forget the steps.

76
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,598
I forget the decimals,
you forget the steps.

77
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,724
Hey, kiddo. What's up?

78
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,697
How are you doing?

79
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,528
Good.

80
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,932
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

81
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,998
I don't know.
You know better than me.

82
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,771
- Think so?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,005
Yeah, OK.

84
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,048
I'll think of something good.

85
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,112
So... wait a minute. I forget.
When is your birthday?

86
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,585
Is it in three weeks?

87
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,384
You know
it's a week from Sunday.

88
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,448
- It is?
- You know it is.

89
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,324
Oh, yeah, yeah. I forgot.

90
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,363
I think I can make it.
I think I can.

91
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,390
You better, or you're
in trouble if you don't.

92
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,935
Big trouble.

93
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,836
I know. I'll be there. OK?
I'll be there.

94
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,931
You like my hat?

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,374
- Sharp.
- Yeah? Good.

96
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,844
OK. A little kiss.

97
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,882
Have sweet dreams, all right?

98
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,814
Listen...

99
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,045
as long as I know you...

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,588
I got you under my wing, OK?

101
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,851
You're safe, all right?

102
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,916
Remember that.

103
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,291
- Love you.
- Love you.

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,263
Hey! Hey, come here!

105
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,360
Hey, come here,
you little prick!

106
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,386
What are you gonna do?

107
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,457
What are you gonna do?

108
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,798
- John J., how you doin'?
- Frankie, how are you?

109
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,707
- All right.
- I like this band. Nice.

110
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,711
Stella... good singer,
good dancer.

111
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,182
I may have another job for you
at the end of next week.

112
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,411
What do you mean, next week?

113
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,047
It's a little unusual,
but the pay is good.

114
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,488
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

115
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,822
Come on. Next week?
What are you talkin' about?

116
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,293
You'd have to travel
quite a ways, but like I said...

117
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,922
the pay is better
than the average job.

118
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,590
And it's only three days.

119
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,692
But next week. I mean...

120
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,294
It's a little different lately.
Let me think about it.

121
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,236
Yeah, well, relax.
Don't worry about it.

122
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,706
- Sleep on it.
- OK.

123
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,709
I'll meet you here tomorrow
around noon, all right?

124
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,177
- I'll be there, too, OK?
- All right.

125
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,679
Hang in there.

126
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,410
And remember,
tomorrow is promised to no one.

127
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,644
You know what I mean?

128
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,519
Jesus. OK.

129
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,049
Let's go, honey.
You're gonna be late.

130
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,218
- It's five of nine.
- I know, Mom.

131
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,124
OK, come on.
You forgot your lunch.

132
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,663
Here's your lunch.
Have you got your math homework?

133
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,028
Oh, yeah.

134
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,663
You finished it, right?

135
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,704
- I think so.
- OK.

136
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,036
Hey, you forgot
the most important thing.

137
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,836
Oh, yeah.

138
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,638
Come here, baby.
Bye-bye, honey.

139
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,043
- I gotta go.
- OK. Oh, yeah.

140
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,775
Bye, Johnny! See you later!

141
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,181
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hi.

142
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,624
Did you do your homework
last night on decimals?

143
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,992
Yeah. It was so hard.

144
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,762
- How's Frankie doing?
- Frankie's all right, you know.

145
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,598
How's that club
going these days?

146
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,764
Real good. Although, I don't
get there too much lately.

147
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,966
I'd come by...

148
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,032
but I don't think Frankie
likes me around that much.

149
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,101
Why not?
You can come around anytime.

150
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,668
Frankie's all right
once you get to know him.

151
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,044
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

152
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,241
You still dancing?

153
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,046
Some. Not like I used to,
but some. Yeah.

154
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,020
You look a little more tired
than I remember, John.

155
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,749
A little more worn out.

156
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,120
All those late hours
you're keeping.

157
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,351
Whatever.

158
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,291
I couldn't keep
those kind of hours myself.

159
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,022
I gotta hand it to you.

160
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,428
It all depends
on what you're used to, OK?

161
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,797
Yeah.

162
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,860
Come over to the club any time.
Frankie's not a bad guy.

163
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,371
Say hello to your partner,
whatever his name is.

164
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,805
See you around.

165
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,244
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on.

166
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,802
I want to say something.

167
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,941
Come here. I want to make sure
we understand each other here.

168
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,976
Did you say something
about my face?

169
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,579
What do you mean, face?

170
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,215
Just because
you're a fuckin' cop...

171
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,623
you think you got the right
to tell me...

172
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,160
that I got wrinkles on my face?

173
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,492
All I said was you look a little
tired, John, a little worn out.

174
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,259
I didn't say anything
about wrinkles.

175
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,594
- You didn't?
- No.

176
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,727
Whether you meant exactly that
or not, I don't know.

177
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,137
But that's pretty much what you
meant. Wouldn't you say that?

178
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,835
If you misinterpreted
what I said, I'm sorry.

179
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,242
No, no, no. And in the future,
if there is a future...

180
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,644
it would behoove you to keep
your opinions to yourself...

181
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,773
about my face
or anything else about me.

182
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,715
Come on, John.
What are you talkin' about?

183
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,582
OK, enough said.
Enough of your shit.

184
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,452
Just keep your remarks
to yourself. Understood? OK?

185
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,354
Will you listen to this?
You got a problem.

186
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,484
Well, I wouldn't want
that problem to become yours.

187
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,961
So remember what I said and
keep your opinions to yourself.

188
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,089
Just clean the streets up, OK?

189
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,427
Hey, guys!

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,663
Once a cop,
always a fuckin' cop!

191
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,102
Hey!

192
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,198
Do you know you have the best
hair of all your sisters?

193
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,470
Really,
yours is really the best.

194
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,772
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

195
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,144
- This is for you.
- Thanks very much.

196
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,683
- Bye, baby.
- Get ready, OK?

197
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,650
Yeah, if you're lucky.

198
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,190
- How do I look?
- Hey, hey, hey. You look fine.

199
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,256
So funny.
He won't let me touch his hair.

200
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,764
He lets me do the pedicure,
lets me do the manicure.

201
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,800
I can do whatever I want.

202
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,442
Let me see the Ali shuffle.
Give me some Ali shuffle.

203
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,705
Ali shuffle.

204
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,804
There you go.
You still got it.

205
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,679
How you guys doing today?
All right?

206
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,776
Hey, John J.,
have a seat there.

207
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,377
So, what's up, Frankie?

208
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,480
Hey, what's up with you,
farm boy?

209
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,491
You tell me.
That's why I'm here.

210
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,050
You ready to travel?

211
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,858
- You ready to travel?
- Where to, Frankie?

212
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,991
The plane ticket is in my pocket
in my coat over there.

213
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,501
OK, wait a minute.

214
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,538
Let's talk business here.

215
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,505
So, guys...

216
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,070
Hey. Hey, guys.

217
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,271
- Give me ten minutes, OK?
- What? Why?

218
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,644
Why? Because I said so,
that's why.

219
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,582
Just give me ten minutes.
Wait over there, and then...

220
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,018
Hey, you. Come here.

221
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,578
Will you excuse us
for a minute, please?

222
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,249
Thank you.

223
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,725
Hey, fellas, fellas.
Could you go?

224
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,127
We got some business
to attend to, OK?

225
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,132
I appreciate it. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

226
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,725
Yeah. That's my man.

227
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,571
Where to, Frankie?

228
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,368
Somewhere south of the border...

229
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,205
at the other end
of South America.

230
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,472
Well, when would I be back?

231
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,946
Three days maximum.
My partners were thinking...

232
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,778
of sending somebody
that would fit in...

233
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,408
somebody that's more Latin.

234
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,454
But I didn't agree with them
for a second.

235
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,649
Fit in?
What do you mean by that?

236
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,160
They felt that someone Latin
might actually fit in better...

237
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,196
but I argued that all around,
you were the best guy...

238
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,323
and probably the only guy.

239
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,264
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Latin?

240
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,599
What is that shit?
Since when do I not fit in?

241
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,103
I agree. I agree.

242
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,333
What is that Latin shit, then?
I mean...

243
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,501
Oh, man. Maybe eight years
in Guatemala doing what I do...

244
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,874
doesn't qualify me
as a Latin...

245
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,640
but it certainly proves
that I know my way around...

246
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,306
when it comes
to seeing a thing through...

247
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,612
in the most effective
and correct way.

248
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,050
I told them you were fluent
enough to pull this thing off...

249
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,417
that you speak Spanish...

250
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,149
Who's fluent?
Hey, who's fluent?

251
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,054
I could do a better job
than these other jerks...

252
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,855
even if I was the village mute.

253
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,919
And the Latin spic types
that you talk about...

254
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,931
would never have been the ones
in line ahead of me...

255
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,626
if the powers that be
had suddenly wanted...

256
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,793
Daniel Ortega
the fuck out of there, right?

257
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,734
I think I would've been
fluent enough for that.

258
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,135
Forget mining the harbor.

259
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,674
Now, who's gonna pull
the trigger, Frankie? Hey?

260
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,802
Besides, I don't want
the fucking job to begin with.

261
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,903
But if you do want it
done right, I wouldn't worry...

262
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,778
about who's fluent with this
shit or that shit or whatever.

263
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,284
I'd worry about who's
the most qualified, right?

264
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,377
Listen. Listen to me.

265
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,820
Even if I'm too old
for this shit to begin with...

266
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,518
and that's the only drawback
I can see. I mean...

267
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,185
Who needs it?

268
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,024
I agree.
That's why I'm sending you.

269
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,893
That's why I bought
the plane tickets for you.

270
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,899
All I'm saying is that
if you want it done right...

271
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,491
then do it right, that's all.

272
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,934
That's what I'm sayin'.
Calm down, will you?

273
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:23,031
- What else can I say?
- OK, sorry.

274
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,304
It'll take three days...
no longer.

275
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,473
You got my word on that,
farm boy.

276
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,713
One of those jobs popped up.
I'm down and back in three days.

277
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,516
You know, no more than that.

278
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,055
And what will you be doing
exactly?

279
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,024
Exactly? I don't know.
I'll be helping to set up...

280
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,425
some high-level
security systems...

281
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,931
on these coffee plantations
in the mountains in Guatemala.

282
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,933
- Oh.
- Oversee it.

283
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,195
Sort of like the work
I used to do...

284
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,429
right before
I met you and Jenny.

285
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,164
You'll be back by this weekend?

286
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,603
Oh, I have to be.

287
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,833
- Oh, yeah.
- Have to be.

288
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,307
That was part of the deal.

289
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,436
I wouldn't go near the job
unless that was understood.

290
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,111
You know, when you do
the work that you do...

291
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,243
I always get a little nervous.

292
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,014
- You do? Why?
- Yeah.

293
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,886
I feel
it's totally foreign to me...

294
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,926
and I don't know,
I don't know how to say it...

295
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,429
but it's always mysterious
to me.

296
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,964
I'm a mysterious man.

297
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,867
Yes.
It always passes, but...

298
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,802
I don't know,
the way I experience it...

299
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,670
it's very strange.

300
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,404
It's like you become someone
else for a little while...

301
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:37,006
and then you're back.

302
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,519
You mean I get sort of distant
for a while?

303
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,555
Yeah, maybe.
It's more than that.

304
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,556
Look, she's going to jump.

305
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,354
- Oh. Oh, Jenny.
- Nice.

306
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,827
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

307
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,227
I used to ride
when I was a kid...

308
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,390
but I'm afraid
I'm too old for that stuff.

309
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,832
Oh, hey, don't start that.

310
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,234
Don't start that with me.

311
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,273
You know, I was thinking...
What do you think of this?

312
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,138
I'm going to get her...

313
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,074
ten more of these private
lessons for her birthday.

314
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,171
- Think she'll like that?
- No, Johnny, she'll love that.

315
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,545
- Think so?
- Oh, she'll love that.

316
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,277
Good.

317
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,683
You are so good to her.

318
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,244
I think she's like the daughter
that you never had.

319
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,983
- Think so?
- Mm-hmm.

320
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,388
You know,
this may sound strange...

321
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:25,158
but I think
she's better than a daughter.

322
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,131
That's sweet. That is so sweet.

323
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,691
She feels the same way
about you.

324
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,896
- You think so?
- Yes, I do. She does.

325
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,462
Well, I'm going to tell you
something right now... she better.

326
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,509
She better, or she's in trouble.

327
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,177
You're so good to us.

328
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,009
I have to be. I love her.

329
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,156
Yeah. He leaves tonight.

330
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,492
And it's like I said...

331
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,329
if he doesn't get him,
then it's for expenses.

332
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,629
If he gets him...

333
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,068
and the odds are greatly
in his favor that he will...

334
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,698
then we collect the whole thing.

335
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,901
Yeah.

336
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,911
Well, unless you set up
an impossible situation...

337
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,776
it's as good as done.

338
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,213
Yeah. What can I tell you?

339
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,841
He's the best.

340
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,497
Gracias.

341
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,455
Pleasure to meet you.

342
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,756
How's it going?

343
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,195
Good.

344
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,391
Let's go.

345
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,593
The car's right here.

346
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,930
What is your name?

347
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,061
My name? Miguel.

348
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,197
- Miguel? Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure.

349
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,710
- You speak Spanish.
- A little. Just a little.

350
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,679
So, what do you do
in the States?

351
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:23,942
I do many things.

352
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,108
What do you do?
What kind of business?

353
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:29,415
Right now, I do a little bit
of this, a little bit of that.

354
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,480
I do a few things,
this and that, myself.

355
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,626
Believe it or not, I own
a string of beauty parlors.

356
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:42,360
I actually did some hair at one
time, if you can believe that.

357
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,992
You are joking?

358
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,627
What do you mean?

359
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,468
The beauty parlors
are for men or women?

360
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,441
- No, for women.
- For women.

361
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,410
You have a girlfriend?

362
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,706
What do you mean by that?

363
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,247
Because you say, "I have
a beauty parlor for men"...

364
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,543
do I have a girlfriend?

365
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,708
Of course I have a girlfriend.

366
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,719
- Oh.
- Of course I have a girlfriend.

367
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,347
Yeah, a beautiful
girlfriend, and...

368
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,974
I assume that
the name Tony Manas...

369
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,017
means something to you.

370
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,848
It might, yeah. Why?

371
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,451
He's a very influential...

372
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:44,120
you can even say powerful man
here in Buenos Aires.

373
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,494
So I've heard. I think
I'm supposed to meet with him...

374
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,465
sometime later today
or tomorrow, right?

375
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,262
Yes.

376
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,168
You want Miguel or I
to accompany you?

377
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,899
Oh, I'll find him, if it's OK.

378
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,133
I like wandering around
on my own.

379
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,234
I feel more comfortable
that way, if you don't mind, OK?

380
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,642
I don't mind.

381
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,015
This is a...

382
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,582
a very sensitive situation...

383
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,354
we have here.

384
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,556
We've been putting this
together for a long time.

385
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,957
My uncle...

386
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,160
my aunt...

387
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,727
they suffer a lot.

388
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,707
And now we feel that we have
all the elements in place...

389
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,437
and we want this
to be carried out...

390
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,242
efficiently and quickly.

391
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,145
OK.

392
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,013
I think the job
that you have to do here...

393
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,882
will take you
no more than three days.

394
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,689
You should be in New York
by this week.

395
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,055
What job?

396
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,229
The job
that you were sent here to do.

397
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,268
Oh, yeah, that job. Oh, yeah.

398
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,929
Oh, yeah, right, right. Yeah.

399
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,463
This is very important for us.

400
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,636
In the seventies,
in the eighties...

401
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,078
some people did terrible things
in this country...

402
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,640
and our judicial system
did not punish them.

403
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:19,783
A strange immunity
surrounds them.

404
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,292
They have power.
They have authority.

405
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,558
They are untouchables.

406
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,690
Interesting.

407
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,497
There's always two sides.

408
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,061
I don't get into politics.
You want to know my politics?

409
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,872
My politics is put the money
on the table, that's it.

410
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,741
I'm here to sightsee, relax...

411
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,440
look for prize fighters,
make new friends...

412
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,608
but we'll see about
this other thing as well, OK?

413
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,250
And remember this, if you would.

414
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:54,121
Nobody down here
has anything on me.

415
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,160
Nobody... you, you, you... nobody.

416
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,856
Not unless you find a weapon
in my hand and a dead body.

417
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,694
And that's not going to happen.

418
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,257
Nothing can be proved
if you can't prove anything...

419
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,567
so if this is going
to be done at all...

420
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,006
it's going to be done right,
and it's going to be my way.

421
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm sure you understand that.

422
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,939
OK?

423
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,271
It's OK.

424
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:26,620
Ma'am... it was a pleasure.
The meal was excellent.

425
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,352
For me?

426
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,957
Your son?

427
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,058
Who died?

428
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,129
The poor thing.

429
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,840
Thank you. Good luck.

430
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,443
- OK.
- Miguel...

431
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,576
please take our guest
to the hotel.

432
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,587
Si, Hernando.

433
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,486
Nice meeting you, sir.

434
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,787
Both for my wife and myself...

435
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,022
it is a pleasure
having you here.

436
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:14,064
That was a wonderful meal.

437
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,302
She's a very nice lady,
the Senora.

438
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,468
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

439
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,775
She's a good woman, my aunt.

440
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,280
She's not really my aunt...

441
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,408
but that's what I call her
for years.

442
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,610
Yeah?

443
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,718
We... she doesn't know
who you are or why you're here.

444
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,123
That's good.

445
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,286
- But she knows.
- That's OK.

446
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,763
We haven't said a word,
but she knows.

447
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,926
Maybe after
all of this is over...

448
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:48,462
she'll be paid back a little
bit for all of her suffering.

449
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,442
It's the worst thing that can
happen to a mother...

450
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,876
or a parent that I can think of.

451
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,811
Yeah.

452
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,873
How close is my hotel room
to where I get this guy?

453
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,918
It's close. It's certainly
very, very close... close enough.

454
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,424
Well, I'll determine that,
thank you.

455
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,726
We're all very glad you're here,
Mr. Farm Boy.

456
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,059
I want you to stop short
of the hotel.

457
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,599
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Stop right here.

458
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,727
- Here?
- Yeah, right here. Stop.

459
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,498
OK. Understand?

460
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,508
There's a lot of things
you got to learn.

461
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,237
I'll see you later.

462
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,006
Yeah, later. Gracias.

463
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,726
- One-three-one, OK?
- Gracias.

464
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,133
- The first floor.
- Gracias.

465
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,068
- Good sleep.
- Thank you.

466
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,664
Gracias.

467
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,867
Good night.

468
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,981
OK.

469
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,954
- Where is the Huracan Club?
- Right around the corner.

470
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,115
- Are you Italian?
- No, Argentine.

471
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,820
Tony Manas, where is he?

472
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,828
Upstairs? Thanks.

473
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,797
All right.

474
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,740
- Sir, which one is Manas?
- That way.

475
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,519
- Mr. Manas, nice to meet you.
- How are you?

476
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,150
Close the door, please.

477
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,294
Yeah.

478
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,062
You know, Frankie said
he beat your cousin...

479
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,363
in a close fight
in a polo round years ago...

480
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,800
and they never could make
the rematch.

481
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,269
Now, is that true?

482
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,568
Yes, I remember. I like Frank.

483
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,232
Yeah, good guy, good guy.

484
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,243
- So, you are here.
- Yep, I'm here.

485
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,711
So, what do you have for me?

486
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,645
I have this for you.

487
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,645
It's all your bullets.

488
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,686
I think you need only one, no?

489
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,451
Well, it usually
only takes one, yeah.

490
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,787
That's right.

491
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,088
Fine.

492
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,356
You'll be out of here
by the weekend.

493
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,988
This man is coming
from the country...

494
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,397
tomorrow or the next day.

495
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,732
He takes coffee
in the garden in the evening.

496
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,799
OK. In other words,
what you're saying is...

497
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,399
he has his habits.
He's a man of habits.

498
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,741
Only with his meals and coffee.

499
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,041
Is he old or young?

500
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,878
Older. He's a military man.

501
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,181
I believe in the military,
but he went too far.

502
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,222
He crossed the line.

503
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,189
I see. I see.

504
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:38,991
If you need,
here is my private number...

505
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,624
but only if it's an emergency.

506
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,167
And rip it up
when you leave the country.

507
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,533
Thank you.

508
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:50,233
We depend on you
to be fast and efficient.

509
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,607
That's why they sent me.
This is what I do, you know?

510
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,975
Right.

511
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,742
We'll get you out of here
in one hour, two after.

512
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,080
Yeah, I have to get back.
It's very important. I have to.

513
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,244
Trust me.

514
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,721
It's almost one hundred percent.
No problem.

515
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,815
What do you mean by that?

516
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,028
It is almost impossible
for anything to go wrong.

517
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,065
Almost?

518
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,566
Listen, I didn't come
ten thousand miles...

519
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,726
to get my head blown off.

520
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,397
What guarantee do I have?
How tight is this thing?

521
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,440
Frankie knows everything...

522
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,477
but here, I am your man.

523
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,739
Knows what? I don't have to
tell you that Frankie's there.

524
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm here. This is my ass
we're talking about...

525
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,574
not Frankie's, all right?
My ass.

526
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,711
OK. Take it easy. Trust me.

527
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,222
I have a contact
in the federal police.

528
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,382
What?

529
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,087
I have a contact
in the federal police.

530
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,255
- The federal police?
- Mm-hmm.

531
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,821
This is Argentina.

532
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,626
I see.

533
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,670
Very interesting.

534
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,968
So, who knows all this?
I mean, does Orlando know this?

535
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,099
- No.
- Does Miguel know this?

536
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:04,012
No. Only you, me, and Frankie
know this.

537
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,606
So, in other words...

538
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,674
you don't completely trust
Orlando or Miguel.

539
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,848
Orlando, yes. Miguel... it's OK.

540
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,413
Let's leave it at that.

541
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,485
OK, so in other words...

542
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,222
this would keep anybody
from stopping this...

543
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,265
until the last
possible moment...

544
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,993
to find out
this necessary information.

545
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,126
Is that right?

546
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,898
Of course.

547
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,099
OK. Interesting, interesting.

548
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,004
OK, there's nothing else,
I guess.

549
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,171
One other thing.

550
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,112
This is OK for now,
but I may need...

551
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,810
something more powerful,
like a.222 with a scope, OK?

552
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,819
But we'll talk about that
later, all right?

553
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,720
OK. All right.

554
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,019
Yeah.

555
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,455
One moment, sir.

556
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,666
Let's stop here for a minute.

557
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,801
What's that they're supposed
to be doing in there?

558
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,902
What is that?

559
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,913
They are practicing tango.

560
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,014
Now you step in. Turn...

561
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,176
I've danced all my life.

562
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,016
I never saw any tango
like that before.

563
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,148
Interesting.
You got boxing one floor...

564
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,818
tango underneath.
Interesting set up.

565
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,953
So, this is the real tango, eh?

566
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,155
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

567
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,424
Interesting.
I like it, I like it.

568
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,733
Let's go. I like it.

569
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,342
The arm! Watch the arm!

570
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,610
Well done, boy.

571
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,213
Lovely!

572
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,968
Where have you been, senor?
I've been worried about you.

573
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,134
Well, I've been out, you know.

574
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,802
Here and there.

575
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,345
You were supposed
to meet me at six thirty.

576
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,607
It's ten of. Why so early?

577
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,674
I'm sorry.
I guess I got a little excited.

578
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,878
Well, don't be.
It doesn't pay to be excited.

579
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:27,550
Not even a little bit,
so, you know, relax.

580
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,456
I'll be right back.

581
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,324
Don't go away.

582
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,257
Here, sir.
Guard it with your life, OK?

583
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,201
- It's yours, right?
- Yes, of course.

584
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,794
OK. Ciao.

585
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,367
So, there's the house,
and that's the courtyard...

586
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,574
where always he has his meal
in the evenings...

587
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,446
when the weather is good, see?

588
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,611
What if the weather's not
very good? Then what do we do?

589
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,086
I don't know.

590
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,147
OK. You see,
the first mistake we made...

591
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:02,158
is to come up here
in the daylight.

592
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,625
It's dusk.

593
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,559
Yeah, well, you know...

594
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,565
I like to work from rooftops.
That's my style.

595
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:12,194
I make an overall blueprint in
my mind, you know, and then...

596
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,830
It's really the only place
to be alone in a crowded city.

597
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,339
I like it very much.

598
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,204
Let me show you something.

599
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:21,040
Any door, any window...

600
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,773
or any ledge,
any opening or whatever...

601
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,111
where he shows any part
of his body or his head...

602
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,514
I mean, I got him.
He's out of here.

603
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,676
But I can't do it
with a pea shooter.

604
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,414
I'm going to need a.222
with a scope, OK?

605
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,683
A.222 with a scope.
Tell that to Manas, OK?

606
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,748
- .222 with a scope?
- Absolutely.

607
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,350
Otherwise,
I might as well go home.

608
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:41,387
Here you go, girl.
You like those?

609
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,025
You better. You better.

610
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,201
Hey, what are you doing?

611
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,438
You're throwing rocks
at the wrong window.

612
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,412
You're waking up half the hotel.
What are you doing?

613
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,279
- I have news.
- About what?

614
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,548
- Can I go upstairs?
- No, you can't come upstairs.

615
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,350
I'm busy, OK?

616
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,185
But I'll be right down, OK?

617
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,159
You bastard.

618
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,092
You crazy...

619
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,792
Here's the man
who struck out Mickey Mantle.

620
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,271
Are you nuts?
What's the matter with you?

621
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,207
OK, what... where's your car?

622
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,472
I don't like
to drive the car at night.

623
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,342
I came on a bicycle.

624
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,746
Well, that makes sense.

625
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,716
I have bad news.

626
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,446
What do you mean, bad news?

627
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,011
Our friend in the country...

628
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,387
he had an accident
on his horse...

629
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,187
and he's in the hospital.

630
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,128
Our associates say he'll be
there for two, three weeks.

631
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,824
That's not true.

632
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,594
It's true.

633
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,898
I didn't come 10,000 miles
for you to lie to me.

634
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,961
- I'm not lying to you.
- No, that's bullshit.

635
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,973
That's not true.

636
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,668
I can't get out
of this frickin' country...

637
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,902
for at least three weeks...

638
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,911
because this guy
got busted up on a horse...

639
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,879
and we can't meet with him.
Now, that's what's going on.

640
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,211
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

641
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,375
And that's why I'm pissed off...

642
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,850
because now I'm going to miss
Jenny's birthday...

643
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,352
after I made
a special promise to her.

644
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,752
That's what's going on.

645
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,120
You got to stay there
and finish the business, John J.

646
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,317
You can't be coming back yet.

647
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,360
I know that, Frankie.
Why do you think I'm calling?

648
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,226
All right, all right.
I'll make it up to you.

649
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,162
You don't understand, Frankie.
You don't make it up to me.

650
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,360
You miss the point.
I'm not concerned about me.

651
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,564
I mean, how do you make it up
to Jenny? Tell me that.

652
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,266
I'm sure she'll understand.

653
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,070
How is she going
to understand that, Frankie?

654
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,905
All right, all right,
listen, listen.

655
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,171
- Yeah.
- I'll call Maggie for you.

656
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,145
OK, you call, because
I'm too embarrassed to call.

657
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,977
You do it, OK?

658
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,175
OK, but in the meantime...

659
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,447
don't be rushing out of there
before the deal is over, OK?

660
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,612
Take your time.

661
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,883
It was too rushed before,
if you know what I mean.

662
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,017
OK, OK, but just call
Maggie and the kids...

663
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,891
and say hello for me, OK?

664
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,192
I won't be calling unless
it's an emergency, all right?

665
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,526
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

666
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,066
Ciao, Frankie.

667
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,304
I'm going to kill this guy.

668
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,671
Fucking take the job.

669
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,200
Fucking bastard!
You and your fucking jobs!

670
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,270
Shove it up your fucking ass,
you fuck!

671
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,487
This is the last time
I go down to this country...

672
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,924
for you, you fuck.

673
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,519
Find yourself
a new killing machine.

674
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,477
General Humberto Rojas

675
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,591
Miguel, can you hear me?
We're on top of things.

676
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,224
We even have access
to the Yankee's room.

677
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,734
Excellent!

678
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:29,855
When you step inside,
you turn...

679
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,724
He's checking you out.

680
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:39,594
He wants to dance with you.

681
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,604
Seven times.

682
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,372
Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.

683
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,542
Do you speak English?

684
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,710
Yes, a little.

685
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,583
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

686
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,645
I saw you dance seven times
in your club...

687
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,520
and now I want to make it eight.

688
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,684
You did what?

689
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,955
I saw you dance seven times...

690
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:07,826
and now
I want to make it eight times.

691
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,923
It wasn't me.

692
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,264
It wasn't you? Who was it?

693
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,533
- My twin sister.
- Your twin sister.

694
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,471
I don't buy that...
not your twin sister.

695
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:22,342
Yeah, it was me. It was me.

696
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,141
So, do you dance tango?

697
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,741
- Do I dance tango?
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,547
Well, I have,
but I would never admit to it...

699
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,178
after seeing
what you people can do.

700
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,086
Mm-hmm. It's a different animal.

701
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:36,854
Yeah. I've danced all my life.
My mother was a terrific dancer.

702
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,828
And, you know,
this is different.

703
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,728
It's beautiful, special.

704
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,233
- So...
- It's an honor to meet you.

705
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,737
Thank you so much. That's great.
So, where are you from?

706
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,966
Where do you think I'm from?

707
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,099
You have
kind of an edge to you...

708
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,770
so you might be from New York.

709
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,473
- You think so?
- Did I say that right? New York?

710
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,677
And the next question is...

711
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,515
where do I learn
how to do this tango?

712
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,522
At least the beginning,
the whole, you know...

713
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,217
so I can take it back
to New York with me.

714
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,816
- Right here.
- Here?

715
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,361
Milonga's... the right place
to learn to tango.

716
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,294
Milonga like the clubs...

717
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,763
the clubs
like we have in Brooklyn.

718
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,267
We have clubs like clubs here.

719
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,927
Now, are you...

720
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,994
Look, I'm embarrassed
to get out there...

721
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,232
I really am, because
I don't know what I'm doing...

722
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,741
but I'm game if you are...

723
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,471
if you want to show...
will you show me something?

724
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,807
I got to go, so...

725
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,370
What do you mean,
you got to go? I just got here.

726
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,643
Well, you have been here
for a while, so...

727
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,651
I just got here.

728
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,152
No, no, no.
You go too fast, my friend.

729
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,916
What, fast? What, fast?

730
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,584
But, no, really, I have
someone waiting for me, and...

731
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,093
But if you want,
I can give you a lesson...

732
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,357
not tomorrow, but the day after.

733
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,228
I'm shooting a commercial...

734
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,324
so if you want to come
in the afternoon.

735
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,699
Shooting a commercial?
Where?

736
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,297
It's called Museum La Boca.
Boca Museum.

737
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,537
- OK, so you got to go?
- Yeah, I got to go.

738
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,737
Really?

739
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,537
- Will you call me?
- Yeah. Have a good time.

740
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,708
Say bye to Olga for me.

741
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,944
- OK, bye. Nice to meet you.
- Ciao.

742
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,988
Mucho gusto, as they say.

743
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,751
So, what do I do now?

744
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,952
I don't know what to do now.

745
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,188
I'm just stuck here...

746
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,864
with egg on my face.

747
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,864
- Wanna dance?
- No, no, thank you.

748
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,905
- You sure?
- Yes, sure.

749
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,463
OK. Mucho gusto.

750
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,338
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

751
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,851
Next week.

752
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,119
See you next week.

753
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,387
Ciao.

754
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,767
Hey, thanks.

755
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:47,112
Oh, man!
Look at that precious thing.

756
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,915
A goddess!
Look at that sweet bread.

757
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:15,674
Where is the commercial?
Upstairs? Thank you.

758
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,679
Beautiful dance,
beautiful dance you did.

759
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,552
- You like it?
- Yeah, I loved it.

760
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,385
- Are you married?
- What?

761
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,691
- Are you married?
- If I'm married?

762
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,358
Behave.
Have you been practicing?

763
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,562
I'll see you next week.

764
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,906
- Ciao.
- Ciao, ciao.

765
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,999
Now let's go give you
your first tango lessons.

766
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,375
Oh, yeah? Where?

767
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,572
Don't ask.

768
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,417
That's my sister over there.

769
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,722
- She's nice.
- No, she's beautiful.

770
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:39,193
Yeah, I'd say.

771
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,356
Let's try to have
the same energy...

772
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,268
otherwise
we will look like this.

773
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,741
Who's better, you or her?

774
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,242
She is.

775
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,370
She's something.

776
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,074
She's a spitfire.

777
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,755
- I like it.
- You like it?

778
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:10,952
More!

779
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,624
The other leg.

780
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,231
Careful.

781
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,909
Thank you.

782
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:32,641
"Gancho."
(The hook)

783
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,262
- What's her name?
- Pirucha.

784
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,956
Bravo, Pirucha.

785
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,726
The first time I came here...

786
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,768
just this animal,
by doing nothing...

787
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,701
just got my attention,
you know?

788
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,602
- By doing nothing?
- By doing nothing.

789
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,109
For me, the panther
is the symbol of elegance.

790
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,407
You know, it really works.

791
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,776
So many people
show off and everything.

792
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,280
- Exactly.
- Like that tango in Europe.

793
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,078
Absolutely.
You know, like ballroom dance.

794
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,277
That's what I mean.
The same thing, yeah.

795
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,877
You see how they dance?
Hold this.

796
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,547
They do like this.

797
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,319
They dance like this, and
they look like they smell bad.

798
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,156
- You know this game?
- What game?

799
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,820
Stone, paper, and scissors?

800
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,921
I invented it.

801
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,966
No. You ready?
What are you going to do?

802
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,594
OK. I'm for coffee,
you're for ice cream.

803
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,069
- I'm for ice cream?
- Yeah.

804
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,073
- OK. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

805
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,666
OK, best... no. Two out of three.

806
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,472
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

807
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,747
OK. I won, kind of.
We go for coffee.

808
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,284
I won, but it's kind of a tie.

809
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,047
- Again.
- We go for coffee.

810
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,212
You're kind of a cheater.

811
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,449
I'm not a cheat... what?
Don't say that.

812
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,991
You were like, I don't know...

813
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,027
I know. Don't say that.

814
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,356
I never cheated on anything
in my life.

815
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,159
No? You never lie?

816
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,494
- No, I never lie.
- You never lie?

817
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,363
Never in my life.

818
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,769
I've found that tango people
are very negative.

819
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:05,330
They're very competitive
and very, you know...

820
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:06,705
Yeah. Criticizing.

821
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,676
So, yeah.

822
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,771
I'm kind of like an outsider...

823
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,247
like a black ship.

824
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,681
- Black what?
- Ship.

825
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,843
- Sheep.
- Sheep.

826
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,911
Ship. Black ship. Black sheep.

827
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,958
Here comes the black ship.

828
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,720
And over here's
the black sheep...

829
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,455
and over here we have
the black ship.

830
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,224
And a sailboat.

831
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,232
No...

832
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,790
But, you know...

833
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,534
The guy you dance with...

834
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,335
now, that's not your husband?

835
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,239
- Come on.
- Your boyfriend?

836
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,471
- No.
- No?

837
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,604
OK, I'm just curious.
I'm not gonna...

838
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,444
- Why did you guess that?
- I don't know.

839
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,145
I figured down here you dance
with who you're with.

840
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,383
- No. No, you know what I do?
- What?

841
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,720
You want to hear
something crazy that I do?

842
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,625
What? What do you do?

843
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,992
What?

844
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,293
What?

845
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,129
Now I can't tell you
what I do.

846
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,930
Tell me.

847
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:12,464
I discovered that if I buy
my favorite men's perfume...

848
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,273
and I put it on him,
I can dance.

849
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,371
- You can't?
- Yeah, I can dance better.

850
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,746
What happens if you don't
have the perfume on?

851
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,216
I dance OK.

852
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:26,051
But if he is sprayed
with the perfume that I like...

853
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,489
I just dance like I'm dancing
with somebody else.

854
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,026
Obviously,
he doesn't know this, right?

855
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,324
No, I never told him.

856
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,464
What does your husband do?

857
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,058
- I don't have a husband.
- You don't have a husband?

858
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,502
No, I don't have one.
Do you have a wife?

859
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,437
Kind of, yeah.

860
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,769
- Kind of?
- Kind of.

861
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,037
What that means, kind of?

862
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,341
That means all my life I never
had anything, you know...

863
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:54,440
and at this age in my life I've
finally decided to settle down.

864
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,745
Just with one?

865
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,310
- With one what?
- One woman.

866
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,016
- Two women.
- Wow.

867
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,389
She has a daughter.
Terrific.

868
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,223
- One and a half.
- Yeah.

869
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:09,163
That may be the real reason.

870
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,097
Have you ever cheated on her?

871
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,691
- Who?
- You.

872
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,363
- Who? On my wife?
- Well, future wife.

873
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,066
That's a pretty
personal question.

874
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,075
Well, you ask
too many questions.

875
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,667
I guess the answer is yes.

876
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

877
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,777
I don't know.

878
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,044
Really?

879
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,415
I don't know.

880
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,647
- You travel a lot.
- Yeah, I do. I travel a lot.

881
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,712
So, does she travel with you?

882
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,384
- No, never.
- No?

883
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:38,154
Never.

884
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,528
So, anyway, my stepdaughter
is, you know, beautiful.

885
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,363
- How old is she?
- Ten.
