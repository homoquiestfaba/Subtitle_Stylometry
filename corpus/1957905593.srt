Whoa...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Whoo! It's okay.
It's all good.

Oh, wait, wait! Taxi! Taxi!

00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,288
Oh! Sorry.

00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,296
Good morning!

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,424
I made it!

[exhales]

13
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,634
It's done.

14
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,345
So this is why you're
seven hours late.

15
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,429
Yeah.

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,097
I stayed up all
night working on it

17
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,557
so it would be...

18
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,559
just...

19
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,894
perfect.

20
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,895
Cool!

21
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,772
Wow, that's a lot of snow.

22
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,023
Yeah, well,

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,108
I thought it could use
a light Chicago snowfall

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,419
to put the clients in
the Christmas mood.

25
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,571
But the model is for a
golf clubhouse in Miami.

26
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,574
- It's a lot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,742
Okay...

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,702
Shoot, it's not coming off.

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,746
It's too sticky.

30
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,747
Why did you make it sticky?

31
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,123
So it would stick!

00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,250

33
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,543
You have five minutes

34
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,504
to get this to Mr. Heaton
in time for his pitch.

35
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,673
No, I have...

36
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,965
35 minutes.

37
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,887
I padded the time in case
there were any issues.

38

[gasps]

39
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,637
The washroom!

40
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,639
Excuse us!

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,933
- Hey.
- Hi!

42
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,519
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

44
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,442
When are you gonna talk to him?

45
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,944
You've said hi a million times.

46
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,404
Hey, focus, Holly.

47
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,158
[Holly] Are you
sure about this?

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,910
Maybe you should just re-do it?

49
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,203
What? No. There's no time.

50
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,163
You know what Mr. Heaton's
like with deadlines!

51
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,667
Okay. Yeah. Here goes.

Oh, no.

56
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,240
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- It's fine, it's fine.

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,491
[Holly] It's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

58
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,809
[Emma] You know how
many hours that took me

59
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,519
One bad decision

60
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,062
and my whole life
takes a nose dive.

61
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,815
I really thought this
was going to be the one.

62
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,917
[Holly] There will be others.

63
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,819
Six years I've been
doing renovations.

64
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,861
[Mr. Heaton] Emma.

65
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,614
Mr. Heaton!

66
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,907
It's three o'clock.

67
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,325
I didn't see your
model out there.

68
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,328
Yeah... about that...

69
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,665
We had just, like, sort
of a small situation,

70
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,875
and, um,

71
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,556
the model's not ready
to show the clients.

72
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,503
I hope this isn't the equivalent

73
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,880
of my dog ate my homework?

74
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,340
[laughing nervously]

75
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,343
Um, I'm just gonna...

76
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,553
I gotta...

77
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,387
Bye!

78
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,555
Holly, don't! Don't go!

79
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,327
I just have to fix
a couple things.

80
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,995
Could I get it to you
first thing in the morning?

81
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,229
Oh, no. That's a no-go.

82
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,999
We're having dinner with
the clients to work on it.

83
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,982
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

84
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,317
Yeah...

85
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,693
Believe me, I know.

86
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,861
I mean, um...

87
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,987
I...

88
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,572
I understand...

89
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,614
Mr. Heaton.

90
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,825
Shame.

91
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,785
I really liked the concept.

92
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,244
It sounded promising.

93
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,498
Well, enjoy your
Christmas, Emma.

Uh, good.

Yeah, um...

too low and lose a toe."</i>

Yeah, that's right. That's me.

Still got all my toes.

<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

with the Christmas lights?</i>

Here, take the phone.

00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,293
Oh, Drew's also gonna help us

113
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,212
get ready for the
Christmas Eve party, too.

what neighbors are for.</i>

Hey, how's the ski lodge?

116
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,092
It's great.

117
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,343
We are busy.

118
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,761
Fully booked for the holidays.

119
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,805
That's amazing. Wow.

00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,265
Yeah.

121
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,726
Oh, hey, Mrs. Roberts is
finally renovating the place

122
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,269
and she's looking
for an architect,

123
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,938
so I threw your name in the hat.

124
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,314
Aw, well, thank you,

125
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,733
but you didn't have to do that.

126
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,819
I mean, Chicago isn't exactly
a quick trip to Vermont.

127
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,113
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

128
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,239
<i>Mom also convinced him</i>

129
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>to make his Yule
log again this year.</i>

130
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,244
<i>Yes, although this year,
I'm trying something new.</i>

131
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,662
<i>Big.</i>

132
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,913
<i>Savory.</i>

00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,416
Okay, well, Yule logs
are meant to be sweet.

134
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,417
<i>Not savory.</i>

<i>Perfect Peterson,</i>

137
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,397
there are no rules when
it comes to Yule logs.

138
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,049
Well, it's not a rule,
it's just common sense.

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>Since when?</i>

140
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,777
<i>Hey, come on, you've got to
help me with these lights.</i>

00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,490
Right?

Oh!

00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,888
I am so sorry.

153
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,973
No worries.

154
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,100
I needed a pick-me-up.

155
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,621
That was better than
an espresso shot.

156
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,062
I'm Emma by the way.

157
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,064
- I work at...
- Griffith and Gomez.

158
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,565
You're an architect, right?

159
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,525
Yeah.

160
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,752
It's hard to miss
a golf clubhouse

162
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,196
Right. Yeah...

163
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,489
that didn't end so well.

164
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,532
That's too bad.

165
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,368
I thought the snow
was a nice touch.

166
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,494
Really?

167
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,976
Yeah, it makes sense.
It's Christmas.

168
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,540
My mom was actually
an architect.

169
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,251
She was analytical,
creative, logical.

170
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,919
I admire the profession.

171
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,131

Yes. Max Bancroft.

00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,054
Well, hopefully,

176
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,180
you're not the kind

177
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,181
that sues people for
crashing into them.

178
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,307
No. No, no, no.

00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,904
Well, it was really nice
officially meeting you.

188
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
Nice to meet you.

189
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,450
[together] Happy Holidays.

190
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,578
Okay.

191
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,958
Hey, Emma?

192
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,878
This might sound kind of crazy,

193
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,255
but I'm hosting a Christmas
Eve party tomorrow night.

194
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,923
Just some old law school friends

195
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,176
and neighbors with
no place to go.

196
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,552
If you're interested.

197
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,930
I'm...

198
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,612
I'm actually flying
home tomorrow morning.

199
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,642
Right. Right. Yule logs.

200
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,477
Yeah.

201
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,062
That's a shame.

202
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,103
Some other time, then.

203
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,731
Okay.

204
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,826
[♪♪]

205
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,578
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

206
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,955
Merry Christmas!

207
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,874
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

208
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,585
Merry Christmas!

209
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,962
Why, thank you.

210
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,173
Merry Christmas!

211
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,801
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

212
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,302
Merry Christmas!

213
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,404
Why, thank you, young lady.

214
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,513
And what would you like me

215
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,682
to bring you for
Christmas this year?

216
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,600
Uh...

217
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,018
I don't know.

218
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,996
Maybe for something to work
out in my life for once.

219
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,105
Ooh, tall order.

220
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,524
Anything specific?

221
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,692
No...

222
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,486
You know, I get so
close to what I want,

223
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,821
and then it just doesn't happen.

224
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,990
Maybe things happen the
way they're meant to...

225
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,118
you just gotta believe.

226
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,579
Yeah, maybe.

227
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,790
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

228
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,917
Ho, ho, ho!

229
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,128
Merry Christmas!

230
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,173
So, he really saves
short-eared owls?

231
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,341
Yes!

232
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,136
He ticks literally
every box on my list.

233
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,679
He is...

234
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,014
smart, he's driven.

235
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:34,931
Cute...

236
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,016
He's so cute!

237
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,267
And...

238
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,518
he saves birds.

239
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,186
Was that really on your list?

240
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,856
Well, not the birds exactly,

241
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,898
but...

242
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,251
it shows that he
has a kind heart,

243
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,693
and that is number one.

244
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,279
Plus...

245
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,864
he asked me out!

246
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,948
Finally!

247
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,535
Well, I mean...

248
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,203
It's not like I can go anyway.

249
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,205
It's tomorrow.
I won't be here.

250
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,290
Your parents wouldn't mind

251
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,166
if you missed the
Christmas Eve party.

252
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
[sighs]

253
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,418
All I wanted to do

254
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,520
was tell my Dad that
I landed the project,

255
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,628
but...

256
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,339
I definitely cannot
miss the annual party.

257
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,506
What do you want to do?

258
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,217
I wish I could go away with you.

259
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,178
The sun and no stress...

260
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,804
It sounds amazing.

261
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,097
To you.

262
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,224
I'm going to be one big
freckle, the way I burn.

263
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,392
Oh, wait, that reminds me.

264
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,770
I got you something.

265
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,980
Okay. Hang on.

266
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,900
Here! Open it.

267
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,943
I didn't know we were
getting each other gifts!

268
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,365
It's to protect you from the sun

269
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,075
while you're sipping
out of a coconut.

270
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,994
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

271
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,121
Thank you.

272
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,333
[sighs]

273
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,752
I wish I didn't have
to go home tomorrow.

275
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,744
What time is it?

276
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,085
Oh, no!

277
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,795
No, no, no, no, no!

278
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:30,839
Oh! Taxi!

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,966
Please stop, please stop! Yes!

280
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,676
Okay!

281
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,061
Can you go any faster?

282
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,103
I can't move.

283
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,107
Okay.

284
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,191
I'm just gonna walk.

285
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,073
[♪♪]

286
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,160
Thank you!

287

[♪♪]

288
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,834
Sorry. Excuse me.

289
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,132
- Oh!
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

290
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,344
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- I'm sorry.

291
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,721
Sorry. Sorry!

292
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,058
Okay...

293
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,351
[man] Thank you, my dear.

294
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,105
May all your Christmas
wishes come true!

295
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,072

[sighs]

297
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,284
I slept through my alarm!

298
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,744
I'm so glad I made it.

299
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,871
Yeah... sorry...

300
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,748
we just closed the
doors 10 seconds ago.

301
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,958
But the plane's still here?

302
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,396
Sorry, once we close the
doors, we can't re-open them.

303
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,463
Are you serious?

304
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,256
Serious as Santa
on Christmas Eve.

305
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
Oh...

306
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,602
<i>Emma, it's Bob Heaton.</i>

307
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,771
<i>The clients weren't
happy with what they saw,</i>

308
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>so you've got until noon
to get me this model.</i>

309
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,150
<i>And Merry Christmas!</i>

311
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,662
Hi!

312
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,621
I slept through my alarm!

313
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,206
I'm so glad I made it.

314
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,582
It's your lucky day.

315
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,584
We were just about
to close the doors.

316
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,336
Have a good flight.

317
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,337
Merry Christmas.

318
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,797
Merry Christmas!

319
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,801
I love my job.

[phone ringing]

322
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,822
Dad! Hey!

323
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:01,966
Are you here? I don't see you.

324
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,492
Uh, yeah, about that...

325
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,618
Um... [chuckles]

326
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,787
well, your mom had

327
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,248
a minor catastrophe
with the gingerbread,

328
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,308
and we're trying
to figure out...

329
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,476
[Mom] This isn't
about the cookies.

330
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,960
We're making...

331
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,628
[Dad] I'm suggesting
sugar cookies!

332
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,796
[Mom] No, no.

333
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,715
We're going to make
gingerbread houses.

334
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,342
[Dad] Why can't we
do sugar cookies?

335
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,177
[Mom] I think we
can take care of it.

336
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,136
Guy, guys,

337
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,013
I'll just call a car, okay?

338
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,307
No, no need, honey.

339
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,476
We have sent someone
else to pick you up.

340
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,852
Yeah.

341
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,645
Who?

342
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,940
It's a Christmas surprise.

343
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,027
Yeah. It's a
Christmas surprise.

344
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:39,819
Okay.

345
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,196
Okay. Bye.

346
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,865
Okay.

347
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,002
Perfect Peterson.

348
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,880
- Drew.
- Hey.

349
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,175
Looks like someone could use
a detangler in their stocking.

350
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,677
Maybe a dry cleaning
coupon, too?

351
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,387
You know, because you have...

352
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:08,682
You know what, never mind.

353
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,683
Let me get your bag.

354
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,393
Oh, thanks.

355
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,561
Nice flight?

356
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:14,813
Uh, yeah.

357
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,398
Really off to a great start.

358
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,404
[♪♪]

359
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,783
Leather seats.

360
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,410
Oh, yeah. They're heated, too.

361
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,369
Feel that?

362
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,537
Toasty.

363
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,889
What happened to your
old truck, anyway?

364
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,708
It is in my parents' garage.

365
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,084
This girl I dated, Heather,

366
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,086
thought an SUV might
be better for work.

367
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,462
Drew, you love that truck.

368
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,047
I do. I do.

369
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,425
But it's not super
professional, so.

370
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,679
So, you excited
to see your folks?

371
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,847
Yeah, for sure.

372
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,140
I mean, it's been a while.

373
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,307
Oh, yeah.

374
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,183
They felt bad they
couldn't pick you up,

375
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,560
but they were pretty frazzled,

376
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,979
so I offered.

377
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,856
Guess frazzled
runs in the family.

378
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,399
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

379
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,277
Just rethinking your nickname.

380
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,422
So, how are things at work?

381
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,072
Oh, my gosh, work!

382
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,534
Oh, I missed a call.

383
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,119
Shoot.

384
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,122
<i>Emma, it's Bob Heaton.</i>

385
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,082
<i>The clients weren't
happy with what they saw,</i>

386
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,543
<i>so you've got until noon
to get me this model.</i>

387
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,627
Great.

388
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,795
What?

389
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,756
Well, that was my boss

390
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,007
calling to say

391
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,925
that I could redo a
project I was working on,

392
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,552
and I missed it,

393
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,429
and now I'm here!

394
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,305
[groans]

395
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,432
Well, it's almost Christmas...

396
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,476
maybe it's a sign to
just enjoy the holidays?

397
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,188
You wouldn't understand.

398
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,157
Do you smell pizza?

399
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,451
I'm always smelling pizza.

400
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,874
[Emma] I'm so sorry, Mom.

401
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,459
Something happened
to my alarm clock.

402
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,295
Well, who still uses
a regular alarm clock?

403
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,798
You've never missed the
family Christmas Eve party.

404
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,591
Yeah. Ever.

405
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,759
I know, I know.

406
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,219
I just...

407
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,821
Look, at least I'm gonna
make it home on time

408
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,263
for Christmas dinner, right?

409
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,824
I got my flight rebooked for
first thing in the morning.

410
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,725
Honey, don't stress, okay?

411
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,976
Yeah, all that matters

412
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,478
is that I'm gonna
see my daughter

413
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,021
over the holidays.

414
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,775
I come bearing a
savory Yule log.

415
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,694
Guess who's here.

416
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,861
Hi, Drew.

417
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,738
Hi, Emma. You on your way?

418
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,281
She's missing the party.

419
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,408
What?

420
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,677
What are we going to
do without our elf?

421
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,660
<i>Yeah, ha-hah.</i>

422
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,702
Very funny.

423
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,788
You know what,

424
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,932
why don't you and your parents

425
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,000
come over for Christmas
dinner tomorrow?

426
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,335
Oh, you're just
trying to save me

427
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,753
<i>from my mom's dry turkey,</i>

428
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,796
<i>aren't you?</i>

429
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,297
Well, that too.

430
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,508
Yeah, I'll call her right now.

431
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,927
[Dad] <i>We'll see you
tomorrow, Peanut.</i>

432
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,721
Okay, bye. I love you.

433
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,055
[parents] <i>Love you, too!</i>

434
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,183
Hi there.

435
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:03,648
[♪♪]

436
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,360
Max?

437
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,778
Hey!

438
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,964
Didn't expect to see you here.

439
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,549
Me either. I thought
you were going home.

440
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:12,699
Yeah...

441
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,034
I missed my flight.

442
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,535
I mean, I'm usually very good

443
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,120
about preparing for
all eventualities,

444
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,788
but I should have
double-set my alarms.

445
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,248
Rookie mistake.

446
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,458
Yeah.

447
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,210
Christmas mocha?

448
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,046
Sure.

449
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,422
What's in it?

450
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh, it's just a regular
mocha with a festive name.

451
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,593
Oh. Nice.

452
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,512
So, I'm surprised
to see you working.

453
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,348
It's Christmas Eve.

454
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,367
I know I'm going to sound
like a Christmas curmudgeon,

455
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,577
but there's something peaceful

456
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,894
about being in the office

457
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:41,811
and looking down at
the street below,

458
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,104
where everyone

459
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,415
is fighting their way
through the holiday rush.

460
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,232
Christmas wouldn't be Christmas

461
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,401
if it wasn't for
last-minute shoppers.

462
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,778
So...

463
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,820
why are you here?

464
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,906
Oh, getting another
shot at my model.

465
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,324
I have until noon.

466
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,659
Maybe don't take it into
the washroom this time?

467
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,702
Oh...

468
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,496
well, thank you!

469
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:01,915
That's a good tip.

470
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,416
Hey, Emma?

471
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,252
I'm guessing you probably
don't have plans tonight, so...

472
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,295
the offer is still open

473
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,214
if you'd like to
join me at my party.

474
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,425
I would love to.

475
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,467
Great.

476
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,387
Okay.

477
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,935
- There you are!
- Hi!

478
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,770
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

479
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,021
It's so nice to see you!

480
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,815
Oh, you look beautiful.

481
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,608
Come on, let me take your coat.

482
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,276
Yeah, why don't you
take your hat off?

483
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,032
- Oh...
- Uh-oh.

484
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,617
Looks like we have
a hair crisis.

485
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,160
Mm-hmm, yeah.

486
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,579
A little girl made me into her
personal gingerbread house.

487
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,621
And that's not all.

488
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,463
Why didn't you say anything?

489
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,966
And ruin your chipper mood?

490
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,634
We'll get you cleaned up

491
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,928
and back in Christmas
spirit in no time.

492
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,239
What? No, no, no.
No, no. No, no.

493
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,865
It's taken me years
to get this hairstyle.

494
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,659
I've got a guy in Chicago...
He's very hard to...

495
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,767
It's fine.

496
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,896
Thank you for
picking her up, Drew.

497
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,314
Oh, my pleasure.

498
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,983
Rough trip?

499
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,401
Oh, don't look at me.

500
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:12,527
I found her that way.

501
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,363
Hey, I got a job
for you. Come on.

502
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,408
- Oh, another one.
- Of course.

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,428
- Ow, ow, ow!
- It's not coming out.

504
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,996
Okay, well, maybe use
some oil or something?

505
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,080
That's not going to do it.

506
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:24,998
Ow.

507
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,334
How are things going with Drew?

508
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,418
Fine...

509
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,504
Can you expand on that?

510
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,714
No...

511
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:34,066
Mom, he used to tease
me all through school.

512
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,675
He called me "Perfect Peterson",

513
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,361
which is probably going
to change after this.

514
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,345
Ow!

515
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,096
You know what
teasing means, right?

516
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,098
Yeah, well, we're not
at the school yard, Mom.

517
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,100
Tell that to your hair.

518
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,810
Look, I'm gonna
have to cut it out.

519
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:46,811
What? No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,647
Just close your eyes...

521
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,523
and breathe.

522
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,233
Are you talking to me or you?

523
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,778
There! I got it!

524
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,819
Mom!

525
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,490
Is it bad? Is it obvious?

526
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,494
It might need to be
evened out a little bit.

527
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,246
What?

528
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,378
[♪♪]

529
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,760
[knocking]

530
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,554
Max! Hi!

531
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,867
Hey. I hope you're okay with
me coming to your office.

532
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,951
There's no receptionist today.

533
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,435
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

534
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,229
Getting things done. Nice.

535
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,482
Yup, almost finished.

536
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:35,777
You okay?

537
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,778
Yeah, yeah,

538
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,488
just a bit of a
Christmas crisis.

539
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,490
Oh, no, here, sit.

540
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:41,741
Thanks.

541
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,661
The caterer for
my party canceled.

542
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,746
Oh, that's not good.

543
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,831
They double booked,

544
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,141
thinking they could
handle both jobs.

545
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,060
Guess I got the short end
of the peppermint stick.

546
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,335
How many people are coming?

547
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,294
About a dozen.

548
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:54,879
Uh-oh. What are
you going to do?

549
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,172
Order a pizza?

550
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,984
Throw a couple red and
green peppers on there?

551
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:58,967
Maybe edible tinsel?

552
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,552
Is that a thing?

553
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,762
I could make it a thing.

554
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,097
No. I'm sorry.

555
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,099
Pizza is unacceptable
for Christmas.

556
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,101
No, you need party poppers,

557
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,602
you need a Yule log,

558
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,520
dip,

559
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,771
piggies in a blanket for sure.

560
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,897
Whoa, whoa...

561
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:13,982
Sorry.

562
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,042
I think I got a
little carried away.

563
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,110
I'm imagining the
menu I'm missing

564
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,862
at my parents'
Christmas Eve party.

565
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,488
That's a bummer.

566
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,115
Yeah.

567
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,074
Well, maybe you
could help me out?

568
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,535
Channel that frustration.

569
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,369
I...

570
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,455
I mean, I could...

571
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,890
you know, I know it
wouldn't appear that way,

572
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,000
but I'm usually pretty
good under a crisis.

573
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,668
Well, knowing that,

574
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,837
do you maybe want to help
me shop for the party?

575
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,589
We could hit up the
Christmas Market?

576
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,717
Did you say Christmas Market?

577
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:48,683
[♪♪]

578
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,561
Hey. Well, that is a look.

579
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,645
Mm-hmm.

580
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,980
Yup. Go ahead.

581
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:54,981
With what?

582
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,233
Make fun of my hair.

583
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,818
I think it's cute.

584
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,236
Very festive.

585
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,839
Okay, this is the only clip
that we had, all right?

586
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,448
My cousin left it here.

587
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,967
Maybe you should 'a just left
that candy cane in there, then.

588
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,494
You know, I'm not teasing you.

589
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,079
I didn't say anything

590
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,372
about how you finally trimmed

591
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,998
that scraggly beard of yours.

592
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,601
Should I not have trimmed
that scraggly beard?

593
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,126
Well, you only grew it

594
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,520
because your
ex-girlfriend, Joanna,

595
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:17,962
loved guys with beards.

596
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,339
No, I did not do that for her.

597
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,091
It gave you that terrible rash.

598
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,051
I didn't change myself for her.

599
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,973
You know what, it's called
trying something new.

600
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,346
Because I'm very open-minded.

601
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,515
And sometimes, it works,

602
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,516
sometimes, it doesn't.

603
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,394
Example, please,
of when it works?

604
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,188
I wouldn't be manager
at the ski lodge

605
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,690
if I didn't join the ski team.

606
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,776
Okay, well, I convinced you
to join the ski team, so...

607
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,528
Yeah, you did.

608
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,862
Hey, Drew, do you think

609
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,715
the lodge can spare some
salt for our driveway?

610
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,657
Sure.

611
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,367
Emma can go with you to help.

612
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,161
Mom, you need me to
help you in the kitchen.

613
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,204
Nope. Actually, we don't.

614
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,248
We've got every
last detail covered

615
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,874
right down to the party poppers.

616
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,376
But my coat is...

617
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,778
Your old one's in
the front closet.

618
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,881
Oh, and your grandma got
you a new Christmas sweater.

619
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:03,216
It's on the bed.

620
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,718
You should wear it.

621
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,719
Aw.

622
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,470
Maybe it'll match your bow.

623
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:15,437
[♪♪]

624
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,439
This one's for you, Grandma.

625
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:26,072
[♪♪]

626
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,408
Everything smells so good!

627
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,118
Good thing I have a
very specific list,

628
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,870
so we stay on task.

629
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,912
Yes.

630
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,497
I love a list.

631
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,139
You know, it's funny
how things work out.

632
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,584
I mean, we only just met,

633
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,419
and now we're planning
this party together,

634
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,087
even though it's
sort of our first...

635
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,297
outing...

636
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,965
Outing? No, I
consider this a date.

637
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,110
I always wanted to ask you out,

638
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,552
I just never had the nerve.

639
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,511
What? Really?

640
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,780
Because I thought
the same thing...

641
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,139
"Why doesn't he ask me out?"

642
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,974
"Should I ask him out?"

643
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,852
- Look at us now.
- Yeah.

644
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,940
♪ O, Christmas tree
O, Christmas tree ♪

645
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:04,235
♪ How lovely are thy branches ♪

646
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,278
I love that song.

647
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,696
You know, the original lyrics

648
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,491
didn't actually refer
to a decorated tree...

649
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,243
instead, to the fir's
evergreen quality

650
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,703
as a symbol of constancy.

651
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,956
It wasn't until the 20th century
that Christmas was added.

652
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,001
Huh.

653
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,128
You seem like quite the
Christmas-tree aficionado.

654
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,296
Not really.

655
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,815
I put up a small,
artificial one each year,

656
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,633
but I'm more of a history buff.

657
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,094
I mean, for me,

658
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,154
it just wouldn't
feel like Christmas

659
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,179
without a real tree.

660
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,639
All those needles to clean up,

661
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:34,015
ornaments to take down,

662
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:35,409
dragging the thing
out on the sidewalk

663
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:36,851
when you're done with it.

664
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,395
All right, all
right. I hear you.

665
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,854
I hear you on the needles,

666
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:42,982
but you should really try
getting a real tree sometime.

667
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,026
I mean, the smell alone...

668
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,444
It's scientifically proven

669
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,321
to create calm
around the holidays.

670
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,281
Oh, mine smells calm, all right.

671
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,866
Mine smells like lavender.

672
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,076
[chuckles]

673
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,202
That's weird.

674
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,495
Okay, I have to admit,

675
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,621
the smell of a real tree

676
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,997
takes me back to
when I was a kid.

677
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:58,957
[cell phone chimes]

678
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh...

679
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,167
sorry, it's home.

680
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,544
Yeah.

681
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,590
[typing]

682
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,096
Okay, so we need to get

683
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,222
party poppers,

684
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,432
dinner rolls, crackers,

685
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,808
Christmas cookies...

686
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,642
Mm!

687
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,102
Oh, and the vendor over here

688
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,187
has charcuterie with
six different cheeses.

689
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,522
Ah. I see, I see.

690
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,024
Organized by refrigeration.

691
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,275
Yeah, I do the same thing

692
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,377
when I go to the Farmer's
Market on Sundays.

693
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:27,819
I appreciate that.

694
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,322
My friends always tease me
for being overly organized.

695
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,907
I don't know why.

696
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,309
But, yeah, I got to check out
that Farmer's Market sometime.

697
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,579
Maybe we could go together.

698
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,372
I could cook you dinner.

699
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,041
I love to cook.

700
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,959
I would love that.

701
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,210
Oh, look...

702
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,837
Spanish chorizo.

703
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,130
My favorite.

704
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,428
Want some?

705
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,846
Got it at a gas station.

706
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:56,723
Pass.

707
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,224
How many of those do you eat?

708
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,142
As many as I want.

709
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,685
That's why I got
the family pack.

710
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,570
I like this look on you.

711
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,197
What's that supposed to mean?

712
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,573
Well, you know,

713
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,367
the fancy clothes,
the designer bag.

714
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,576
I like puffy-jacket Emma,

715
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,370
who dresses like an elf,

716
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
and, I don't know,

717
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,623
eats whipped cream
out of the can.

718
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,708
Well, people change, Drew...

719
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,627
- Ah!
- [laughs]

720
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,922
Who put this here?

721
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,632
Was it you? Huh?

722
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,394
All right, I'll let it
slide just this once.

723
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,557
[Emma] Hey, don't blame Santa.

724
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,017
You probably put it there.

725
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,354
This looks incredible.

726
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,689
I mean, look at the garlands.

727
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,482
Emma! Is that you?

728
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,984
Gordon, Merry Christmas!

729
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,904
Wow, you must be so
happy to be home.

730
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,990
This place looks beautiful!

731
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:57,867
Cool bow.

732
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:58,993
Is that your city look?

733
00:26:59,035 --> 00:26:59,994
What? No.

734
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,538
No, no, no, I really like it.

735
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:04,541
You know, I think this could
be your whole new signature...

736
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,376
You know, for every
season, a new bow.

737
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:07,627
You could have an Easter bow.

738
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,421
A Harvest bow...

739
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,965
Ooh, oh! A Valentine's bow.

740
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,384
Yeah, I think we're really
onto something here.

741
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,386
Oh, yeah, I agree.

742
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,571
I'm gonna let you two brainstorm

743
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,431
while I grab some salt.

744
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:21,182
I'm gonna go take out this bow!

745
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,479
[Emma] So what made you
get into Environmental Law?

746
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,440
My parents had me
volunteering everywhere

747
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,899
when I was a kid.

748
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:33,570
From soup kitchens to
cleaning up beaches.

749
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,654
I guess it kind of stuck.

750
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,756
That's so great
that they did that.

751
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,656
Yeah, well, they
knew I'd need it

752
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,241
for my college applications.

753
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,659
Oh.

754
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,970
I actually wanted to be a
vet, but my dad's a lawyer,

755
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,638
so I just ended up
following in his footsteps.

756
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,539
Hence the Short-eared Owl.

757
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,167
And the California Condor.

758
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,418
You know, I love the law,

759
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,378
so it's the best of both worlds.

760
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,439
We've done a lot of good work,

761
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,298
cleaning up toxic
sites in Alaska,

762
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,924
protecting endangered animals.

763
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,886
Wow. Good for you.

764
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh, look, your speciality.

765
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,773
Yup. I'm all about
a strong foundation.

766
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,524
You know, my mom
could never figure out

767
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,361
why my walls didn't fall down
like all the other kids'.

768
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,570
Already a budding architect.

769
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,406
Yeah. My dad's a
contractor, so he taught me.

770
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,326
We used to make these elaborate,
multi-storey gingerbread houses,

771
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,870
with lattice and lights!

772
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,080
And then, as I got older,

773
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,289
the gingerbread

774
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:27,457
sort of turned into...

775
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,125
2x4s and bricks.

776
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:31,270
When I'd come home for college,

777
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,605
my dad would let me
work on his houses,

778
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,214
and I'd tweak the blueprints,

779
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,548
I'd even paint,

780
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,092
and hammer...

781
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,136
I loved it.

782
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,347
We have this saying...

783
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,265
"From blueprints to
boots on the ground."

784
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,268
Sounds like he was a
big influence on you.

785
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,747
I think it was a pretty big deal

786
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,272
when I got into
architecture school.

787
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,066
You know, my dad
didn't go to college,

788
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,442
so it was...

789
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,152
it was sort of his dream, too.

790
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:59,239
Does he put a lot
of pressure on you?

791
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,117
I don't know...

792
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,160
I just don't want
to disappoint him.

793
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,985
We should get one for the party.

794
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,875
Oh, I don't know, it's
just gonna get stale.

795
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,395
I'm not gonna be here
on Christmas anyways.

796
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,586
Come on.

797
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,296
It's not a party without one.

798
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,174
Okay, you've convinced me.

799
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,100
I think we have
everything we need.

800
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,101
Great.

801
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,936
Can I call you a car home?

802
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,315
Um...

803
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:37,110
I am actually gonna grab
one more gift for my family,

804
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,486
but...

805
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,464
I'll see you at your place
in an hour to decorate?

806
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,073
What would I do without you?

807
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,427
I can't believe you're
saying that to me

808
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,827
after 24 hours.

809
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,704
Guess we're making
up for lost time.

810
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,873
Yeah, we already bought
a house together.

811
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,168
Okay, well, I'll...
I'll see you later.

812
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,837
- Okay.
- Okay.

813
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:09,809
[♪♪]

814
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,227
I look like I did
in high school.

815
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,855
Hmm.

816
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,857
Since when did looking
younger become a bad thing?

817
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,319
Um...

818
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:20,362
I got you this.

819
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:22,322
Oh!

820
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,574
Thank you!

821
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:25,533
Where did this come from?

822
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:26,743
The gift shop.

823
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:28,453
There's a lot of
stuff in the closet,

824
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,996
if you know where to look.

825
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,999
Now you look like Emma.

826
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,878
Thanks, Drew.

827
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,565
You know, I heard about your
accessible work program.

828
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:42,550
It sounds like you're doing
a pretty good thing here.

829
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,594
Oh, please, happy to do it.

830
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,845
You know I got the idea

831
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,806
when I was volunteering
for their ski team.

832
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,349
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

833
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,809
See, that's funny,

834
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,869
'cause I wonder who suggested
that you would do that.

835
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:54,145
Yeah, I can't
remember who it was.

836
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,232
It sounds like you've
really found your calling.

837
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,442
Well, nothing better

838
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,152
than seeing people
have a good time.

839
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,363
Drew, I thought you were off?

840
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,781
I am.

841
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,908
I just can't stay
away from this place.

842
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,536
So, how are things?

843
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:10,787
Good!

844
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,669
The breakfast and lunch
crowds were very happy.

845
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:13,998
And I just finished

846
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,501
a fun introductory frittata
class with some guests.

847
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,961
Cool.

848
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,546
Um, this is Sarah, by the way.

849
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:20,880
She is a new chef,

850
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,383
and she lives near our folks.

851
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,634
Oh, really? Wow.

852
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:25,677
Nice to meet you.

853
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,886
- I'm Emma.
- You, too.

854
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,680
Well, I'm going to head home.

855
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:29,782
I worked on the
menu with Pierre,

856
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,266
he'll be taking over.

857
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,285
[Drew] Oh, yeah.
Looks delicious.

858
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,521
And we have a chickpea
curry as a vegan option,

859
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,815
which is my personal favorite.

860
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,457
So, what are you doing
for Christmas Eve?

861
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,444
Nothing, actually.

862
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,629
It'll be nice to just
relax for a change

863
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,196
and not cook.

864
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,949
Hey, since you live so close by,

865
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,885
my parents are having a party,
if you'd like to pop in.

866
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,578
That's really nice.

867
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,038
Thank you.

868
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,498
Oh, and hot-cocoa hour
is about to start.

869
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,500
We have all the
toppings you like, Drew.

870
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,752
Come back for some.

871
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,171
Oh, we will.

872
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,297
See ya.

873
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,261
[Emma] Wow.

874
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,637
Nice office!

875
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,431
Nice sweater.

876
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,307
Excuse me.

877
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,725
I am taking one for the team.

878
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:15,602
Okay, my grandma
deserves some respect...

879
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:18,480
even though she buys me
slightly questionable sweaters.

880
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,689
Hey!

881
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,900
Do you still play?

882
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:22,901
Yeah...

883
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,128
I mean, not as
often as I'd like.

884
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,278
You know, I remember

885
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,946
you picked this
up in senior year

886
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,741
because Chantelle
on the soccer team

887
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,285
really loved musicians.

888
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,787
I don't think we lasted a month.

889
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,748
But I was hooked on
playing after that, so.

890
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,835
Sadly, girls are more into
cars than guitars these days.

891
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,504
Ah, yes, hence the SUV?

892
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,467
What are you doing?

893
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,778
I like to ditch
the bulky sweaters

894
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:49,820
while I'm at work, you know,

895
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,221
so people take me
more seriously.

896
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:53,056
Oh, I don't know anyone

897
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,766
who would take you
seriously right now.

898
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:55,868
Mind giving me a hand, then?

899
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,161
I think it's stuck on something.

900
00:32:57,185 --> 00:32:58,561
Wait, don't pull it.

901
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,480
Don't pull it, don't
pull it, don't pull it.

902
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,523
Okay. All right.

903
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,776
It's on your button. Hang on.

904
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,277
[Drew] It's like
I'm in a cocoon.

905
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,488
Okay. Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

906
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,531
There we go.

907
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:11,574
Phew! I was starting to sweat.

908
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,827
Yeah, it's...

909
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:15,704
hot in here.

910
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:16,746
Well, thank you for that.

911
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,248
[Emma] Mm-hmm.

912
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:20,041
Um, I'm going to get my tie.

913
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,001
Oh, a tie?

914
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:22,085
Let me guess.

915
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,878
Someone suggested
that you wear it?

916
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,339
Yeah. Sarah might've
mentioned it.

917
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,716
Oh... Sarah.

918
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,718
Are you two dating, or?

919
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,053
Oh, no. We're just friends.

920
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,430
But she is right.

921
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:36,182
I mean, having a tie makes
me seem more professional.

922
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:37,868
You didn't become the
manager of a ski lodge

923
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,060
because of a tie.

924
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,062
You got the job because
you're good at it.

925
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,439
Ha! Got it.

926
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:44,858
[laughs]

927
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,526
That's not a tie,
it's a clip-on.

928
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,986
A tie is a tie.

929
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,029
Okay.

930
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,238
Let's see it.

931
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:54,868
Um... Okay, um...

932
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,411
Can I? May I? Just, please?

933
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,079
Oh, sure. Please.

934
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,664
Under.

935
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,583
Very important.

936
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:03,626
Buttons...

937
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:05,086
Yeah.

938
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,965
There. You look...

939
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,151
You look much more presentable.

940
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,760
Yeah? You think
I clean up okay?

941
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:12,886
Mm-hmm.

942
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,387
Yeah, I think...

943
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,014
Yeah. Some girls
might like that.

944
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,223
[laughs]

945
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:18,985
Well, hey, it's not
easy dating around here.

946
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:21,394
Small towns are kind of like...

947
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:23,229
finding love in a snow globe.

948
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,942
Probably a lot more
options in Chicago, I bet.

949
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:29,045
Yeah, I mean, you
would think so,

950
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,504
but I have swiped
left so many times,

951
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,489
I'm gonna be in
Indiana pretty soon.

952
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,742
I mean,

953
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,053
there's this one lawyer
who works in my building,

954
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,095
we just keep passing
each other in the hallway

955
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,080
without really
saying hello, so...

956
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,457
Not easy in a big city either.

957
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,461
Well...

958
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,504
shall we?

959
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,632
Sure.

960
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,470
[phone ringing]

961
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,474
[phone ringing]

962
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,394
Holly, hi!

963
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:04,604
What happened to you?

964
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:05,605
<i>I took off your sunhat</i>

965
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:06,898
while I was surfing

966
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,958
so I wouldn't get pummeled,

967
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,776
and instead, I got burnt.

968
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:11,903
Ow. I'm sorry.

969
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:13,571
<i>Wait, are you in your apartment?</i>

970
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:15,740
Yeah, I slept in and
missed my flight.

971
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,283
You? How?

972
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:19,494
<i>Well, at least you look
cute on Christmas Eve.</i>

973
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,288
<i>Wait, why do you look so cute?</i>

974
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,915
I'm going to Max's party.

975
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,292
What? Mr. Fancy Lawyer?

976
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:27,419
Yup!

977
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,604
I saw him in the office today.

978
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,213
We were practically
the only ones there.

979
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,465
And we went to the
Christmas Market.

980
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:33,800
I helped him buy everything.

981
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,051
It was amazing.

982
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:36,845
I love this for you.

983
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:38,346
You know,

984
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:39,305
it sort of feels like

985
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:41,516
missing my flight
was meant to be.

986
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:43,685
Oh! And...

987
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:45,895
I'm wearing heels!

988
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:47,188
<i>Heels? No, no, no, no.</i>

989
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,190
<i>Don't do that.
That's dangerous.</i>

990
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,567
<i>You grew up in ski boots.</i>

991
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,777
Okay, but, seriously,
I have to go.

992
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:53,987
I will call you later.

993
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,364
Wear your hat!

994
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,408
<i>Good luck.</i>

995
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,451
<i>Aloha!</i>

996
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,578
Bye.

997
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,503
[♪♪]

998
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,297
[doorbell rings]

999
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,383
Welcome.

1000
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:18,803
Wow, great place.

1001
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:19,845
Thanks.

1002
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,016
Uh, I brought you a Yule log.

1003
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:24,059
It's sweet...

1004
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,393
like it's supposed to be.

1005
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:26,394
Nice.

1006
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,355
Let me take your coat.

1007
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,860
Wow.

1008
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,278
You look beautiful.

1009
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,031
Thank you.

1010
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:39,616
You look great, too.

1011
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:41,618
Thank you.

1012
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,371
Come on in.

1013
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:46,747
[whispers]

1014
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,874
[Emma] This is cool.

1015
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,504
It's a D-28 Harrington.

1016
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,589
Wow.

1017
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,132
You know, I have
a friend back home

1018
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,009
who would die for this.

1019
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:58,968
How long have you played?

1020
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,804
I've always wanted to,

1021
00:37:00,845 --> 00:37:01,971
but honestly,

1022
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,573
my decorator thought
it would look cool.

1023
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,434
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1024
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,686
Totally.

1025
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:08,561
Yeah.

1026
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,647
Hey, we should unwrap this.

1027
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:11,731
Yes.

1028
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:14,858
Not bad.

1029
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,154
So, are you gonna go
home for Christmas

1030
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:19,447
and see your family?

1031
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:21,008
I mean, I haven't even
asked where you're from?

1032
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,325
Milwaukee.

1033
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,369
And, no.

1034
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:27,455
Actually, my mom passed away
when I was in law school,

1035
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,874
so the holidays have been a
little different since then.

1036
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,043
I'm so sorry.

1037
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:33,670
Thanks.

1038
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:37,674
For a while, I still went home
for Christmas to see my Dad,

1039
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,050
but this one year,

1040
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,695
I had this crazy work thing
I couldn't get out of,

1041
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,513
so he booked a tropical vacation
with his old college buddies...

1042
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:47,392
He had a great time,
so he kept doing it.

1043
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:48,494
That must've been
really hard, though,

1044
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:50,729
not seeing your dad
for the holidays?

1045
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,938
Yes and no.

1046
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,565
I started this party, and...

1047
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:56,484
I usually go skiing for a
few days with some friends.

1048
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:59,195
We rent out a couple
of cabins in Quebec.

1049
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,822
It's like a tradition now.

1050
00:38:01,823 --> 00:38:03,575
I'm sure it's hard for
you, not being home.

1051
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:05,910
Yeah.

1052
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:07,454
It's my first time away.

1053
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,706
Who knows,

1054
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,708
maybe it's time for
a new tradition.

1055
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,712
[doorbell rings]

1056
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,923
It's too early for guests.

1057
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,092
One second.

1058
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,677
Excuse me.

1059
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,975
Yeah, I definitely
didn't order this.

1060
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,935
Uh... Kris?

1061
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:32,228
But it says right here

1062
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,606
"Emma Peterson, Clark
Street, apartment 7B."

1063
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,609
Yeah, but I... I
didn't order that one.

1064
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:39,943
Oh, no. Did I mix them up?

1065
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,573
Consider it a free upgrade.

1066
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,301
I told you I didn't want
a real Christmas tree.

1067
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:46,385
I know, but you have to have

1068
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,244
a real Christmas
tree on Christmas.

1069
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:49,954
[Max] The messy
needles? The sidewalk?

1070
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,376
[sighs]

1071
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,378
Whaddya want me to do here?

1072
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:00,131
All right. Bring it in.

1073
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:01,549
I think I might have

1074
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:03,677
some of my family's old
Christmas tree decorations.

1075
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,844
All right!

1076
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:12,894
[♪♪]

1077
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,481
Hey! Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Roberts!

1078
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,067
Emma!

1079
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,194
I was hoping I'd see you
out there on the slopes.

1080
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,612
I will be.

1081
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,197
First thing in the morning.

1082
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,032
Well, what can we get you?

1083
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,242
Emma will have a hot cocoa

1084
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,451
with extra whipped cream,

1085
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:31,079
marshmallows, sprinkles,
and a candy cane.

1086
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,080
I'll have the same.

1087
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,039
Actually, I'm good with plain.

1088
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,667
Plain? What?

1089
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,668
Yeah.

1090
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,812
What about "the colossal cocoa",

1091
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,129
our favorite?

1092
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,547
Yeah, when we were 15.

1093
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,091
Seriously, I've cut back on
my sugar intake since then.

1094
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,027
You mean you've cut back
on your happiness intake?

1095
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,177
Oh, come on...

1096
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,679
I'm sweet enough.

1097
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,931
I can't argue with that.

1098
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,101
Oh! I don't know if
Drew told you yet,

1099
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:54,269
but...

1100
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,937
I'm going to renovate the lodge.

1101
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,731
I've heard.

1102
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:58,732
Congratulations!

1103
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,066
George and I,

1104
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,610
you know, we used to talk
about what we could do,

1105
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,279
and then when he passed...

1106
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,780
it all had to be put on hold.

1107
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:08,700
But since then,
business has doubled.

1108
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:10,994
You know what they say...

1109
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:13,496
things happen when
they're meant to...

1110
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:15,874
Exactly.

1111
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,418
I want to accommodate
more guests...

1112
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,544
and, yeah,

1113
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,226
we've been having
trouble with electrical.

1114
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,716
So what do you
think? Interested?

1115
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:25,925
Um... I...

1116
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:26,968
I mean, I'm flattered,

1117
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,553
but you haven't
even seen my work.

1118
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,347
Actually, your Dad
shows us photos

1119
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:31,848
of all your projects, so.

1120
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,101
- He does?
- Mm-hmm.

1121
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:36,353
[Mrs. Roberts] Yes!

1122
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:37,979
Oh, he's so proud of you.

1123
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,416
You know, he put
his hat in the ring

1124
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,858
to be the contractor?

1125
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,361
My husband, George,

1126
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:47,072
he just loved people
who valued family,

1127
00:40:47,113 --> 00:40:50,492
and I want to work with
someone that I know and trust.

1128
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,243
I mean, that is so nice,

1129
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,286
but I'm really not sure

1130
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,555
I'm the right
person for the job.

1131
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:56,664
I'm trying to focus more
on original concepts.

1132
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:59,084
You could certainly put
your stamp on this place.

1133
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,836
Listen, you think on it.

1134
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,047
We can talk more at the party.

1135
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,549
Okay. Thank you.

1136
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,261
You're missing out.

1137
00:41:10,303 --> 00:41:11,346
Oh, yeah.

1138
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:12,681
Looks like your mouth is, too.

1139
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:15,266
See you tonight.

1140
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:16,393
Digging it.

1141
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:17,686
[Mrs. Roberts] Yeah.

1142
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,020
[laughs]

1143
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,234
Well, the place looks amazing.

1144
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,152
Thank you so much for your help.

1145
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,737
It was fun.

1146
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,535
You're not mad about
the tree, are you?

1147
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,953
No. Not at all.

1148
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,579
I was gonna call you
for clean-up duty.

1149
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,457
Oh. Okay.

1150
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:40,667
Wait.

1151
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,670
- The mistletoe!
- The mistletoe.

1152
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:46,023
Where do you want to hang it?

1153
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:47,048
Uh...

1154
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,634
Oh, okay.

1155
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,052
How about... you wait there.

1156
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:54,723
Right here?

1157
00:41:54,764 --> 00:41:56,141
Perfect.

1158
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:01,062
Got it.

1159
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:04,315
- Whoo!
- Whoa.

1160
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,775
You okay?

1161
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:08,820
Yeah...

1162
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,699
[doorbell rings]

1163
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:15,577
That better not be another tree.

1164
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:20,665
[♪♪]

1165
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,967
[♪♪]

1166
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:38,516
[Mom] Where's Drew?

1167
00:42:38,558 --> 00:42:39,517
Oh, he's salting the driveway.

1168
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:42,145
Oh, he is such a great kid.

1169
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:43,480
Isn't he, though?

1170
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:47,067
It's amazing what a
novelty that is these days.

1171
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:48,360
[Dad] Mm-hmm!

1172
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:49,920
You know, the lodge is
sure lucky to have him.

1173
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:50,904
[Dad] Uh-huh.

1174
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:51,964
Oh, speaking of the lodge,

1175
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,740
I saw Mrs. Roberts
this afternoon...

1176
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,242
[Mom] Oh, she's
coming to the party!

1177
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:57,118
And did she mention

1178
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,244
that I put my name in

1179
00:42:58,286 --> 00:42:59,555
to be the contractor
on the renovation?

1180
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,081
She did.

1181
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:02,332
She actually asked

1182
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,249
if I was interested in
being the architect.

1183
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:04,793
What did you tell her?

1184
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,671
The truth... that I'm busy.

1185
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:09,714
Oh! Did you get
the Miami project?

1186
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,841
They haven't made
any decisions yet.

1187
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:12,884
[Dad] Oh.

1188
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,153
Well, I'm sure
you're gonna get it.

1189
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:15,762
I know how much work
you put in on it.

1190
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:18,932
[chuckles]

1191
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,892
[doorbell rings]

1192
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:21,685
Oh!

1193
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,269
Our first guests are here!

1194
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:24,688
[Drew] Merry Christmas!

1195
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:27,232
Mom's here!

1196
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:28,358
Oh, let me take your coat.

1197
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,068
That looks delicious!

1198
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,153
We just put out
the food. Come on.

1199
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:36,031
[Drew] Hi.

1200
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:38,410
Sarah, hi!

1201
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,412
Thank you so much
for inviting me.

1202
00:43:40,453 --> 00:43:41,746
Yeah, I did do that, didn't I?

1203
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,042
Wow! It's so beautiful!

1204
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:48,962
This is gonna be fun.

1205
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:50,046
Yeah.

1206
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,597
Merry Christmas, my man!

1207
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,473
Wow.

1208
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:01,683
You have outdone yourself.

1209
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,768
Yeah. Your apartment
looks so festive.

1210
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,979
Didn't expect this
from you, Max.

1211
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:06,688
Thank you.

1212
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,981
I owe it all...

1213
00:44:08,023 --> 00:44:09,190
to Emma.

1214
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,110
Are you two...?

1215
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,153
No.

1216
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:14,514
No, no, no. We
just met yesterday.

1217
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,240
- Hi. I'm Sharice.
- Hi.

1218
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:18,116
And I'm Will.

1219
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,367
[Emma] Nice to meet you both.

1220
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,702
[Will] Pleasure,

1221
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:21,971
Why don't we get the two
ladies some champagne?

1222
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:23,038
Thank you.

1223
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:25,415
That's a beautiful dress.

1224
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,875
Oh, thank you.

1225
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:29,461
I've been waiting three months
for an excuse to wear it.

1226
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:31,087
A designer friend
in Paris made it.

1227
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,422
Wow.

1228
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,150
It's nice to have friends
who make gorgeous things.

1229
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:35,174
The best.

1230
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:37,761
So, how did you two meet?

1231
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,221
We work at the same
office building.

1232
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,598
Ah... makes sense.

1233
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,700
Will's a lawyer at the firm

1234
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:45,018
and Sharice is a
circuit court judge.

1235
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,353
You are a judge?

1236
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:47,312
That's incredible.

1237
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:48,688
Youngest on the bench.

1238
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,410
Why do you always have
to tell people that?

1239
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,733
Because I'm proud of you.

1240
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:53,544
And I like to take credit
for your accomplishments.

1241
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:54,986
Uh-huh. There we go.

1242
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,822
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you.

1243
00:44:57,864 --> 00:45:00,408
So, a judge, wow.

1244
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,785
What is your secret?

1245
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:03,906
How have you managed to
climb that ladder so quickly?

1246
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:05,955
This is gonna sound corny,

1247
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:08,625
but I started with a vision
board when I was young,

1248
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,877
and I kept adding to
it over the years.

1249
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:12,504
I kept my eye on
what I really wanted.

1250
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:14,631
I've got one of those, too.

1251
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:15,882
It's a great motivator.

1252
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,884
Great minds think alike.

1253
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:20,095
Yeah, it got me through
some hard years in college.

1254
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:22,472
You know, I think it's important

1255
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,532
to know that we all struggle.

1256
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:24,891
Absolutely.

1257
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,893
Yeah, I don't think we
women share things enough.

1258
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:30,105
Everything always
has to seem perfect.

1259
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:31,146
You are so right.

1260
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:33,316
So, did you...

1261
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,998
did you always know
what you wanted to do?

1262
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:36,611
Actually, no. No.

1263
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:39,364
I double-majored in
neuroscience and French.

1264
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:40,615
Whoa!

1265
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:41,926
Ambition is both a
blessing and a curse.

1266
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,993
I mean, I hardly
ever see my family,

1267
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:46,413
and who knows when I'll
have time for kids...

1268
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:47,956
But I'm achieving my goals,

1269
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:50,083
and that's what's
important to me right now.

1270
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,626
That is what's most important...

1271
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:53,378
Achieving your goals.

1272
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,587
What do you do, Emma?

1273
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:55,922
Emma's an architect.

1274
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,551
I'm a junior architect.

1275
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:00,593
Anything I would've seen?

1276
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:01,678
Mostly just interiors,

1277
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,263
but if you saw my vision board,

1278
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:06,182
you would know that I dream of
opening my own firm one day.

1279
00:46:06,224 --> 00:46:07,434
Good for you.

1280
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:08,893
I'll hold you to it.

1281
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:11,563
See you in a bit.

1282
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:12,731
[♪♪]

1283
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,816
Well, they're a little
overdone, again,

1284
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,776
but some icing, a few gumdrops,

1285
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,945
no one will know the difference.

1286
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:22,282
Are you even listening?

1287
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:24,034
Yeah. Gumdrops.

1288
00:46:24,075 --> 00:46:25,118
Got it.

1289
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,579
Well, the kids can
start decorating...

1290
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,205
And you know what that means...

1291
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:36,838
Are you ready to get dressed?

1292
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:39,466
You know,

1293
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:40,818
I'm so happy to help with
the gingerbread houses,

1294
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:42,570
but I think I'm gonna
skip the outfit this year.

1295
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,137
But you love this costume.

1296
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,473
No, Mom. You love
this costume.

1297
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:48,350
I have maybe outgrown it.

1298
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:50,935
But the kids?

1299
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,521
Okay...

1300
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:55,065
let's compromise.

1301
00:46:57,776 --> 00:47:00,028
All right, here we go.

1302
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,071
Good?

1303
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:02,489
Okay...

1304
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,865
you do still look really cute,

1305
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:07,327
but for the record, I'm
gonna miss my little elf.

1306
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,916
Okay! Who's ready to
make gingerbread houses?

1307
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:22,258
[chuckles]

1308
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:28,056
I always forget how much I love
the look of gingerbread houses.

1309
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:30,725
So cozy.

1310
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:32,602
I love the snow icing.

1311
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:33,829
Reminds me of where I grew up.

1312
00:47:33,853 --> 00:47:36,106
We spent so many
Christmases at the ski hill.

1313
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:41,069
You should come with us.

1314
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,362
Where?

1315
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,865
I mean, this might be a
bit too soon, you know,

1316
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:48,201
but we're going on that
ski trip tomorrow...

1317
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:49,452
The one I was talking about.

1318
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:50,704
Right.

1319
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:51,913
That is very sweet of you,

1320
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,557
but my flight home
leaves at 10 a.m., so...

1321
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,375
Max, Emma!

1322
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,377
It's time for
Christmas charades!

1323
00:47:57,419 --> 00:47:58,378
Everyone!

1324
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,171
Gather round.

1325
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:02,442
I've waited all year
for this re-match!

1326
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:04,968
[phone ringing]

1327
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,014
I've just got to grab this.

1328
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,059
I will be right back.

1329
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:15,103
Drew!

1330
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:17,188
How's it going over there?

1331
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,692
<i>Well, I could really use an
architect with pointy ears</i>

1332
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:22,444
<i>right about now.</i>

1333
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,282
Ooh!

1334
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:29,242
<i>Yeah. I offered my assistance,</i>

1335
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:31,578
<i>but, apparently, they
want "the real architect".</i>

1336
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,580
I'm sorry.

1337
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:34,914
Hey, how are my mom and dad?

1338
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:36,708
They're good. They
miss you, though.

1339
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,001
We miss you!

1340
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:39,044
We miss you, hon'.

1341
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,587
Hey, say hi to Emma, everybody!

1342
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,255
<i>We miss you!</i>

1343
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:45,884
You know, I'm waiting for
your Aunt Martha to arrive.

1344
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:47,427
That'll be my cue to exit.

1345
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:49,929
Ah. That is a perk
of not being there.

1346
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:52,098
Yeah, so you really
don't miss us at all?

1347
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,433
I didn't say that.

1348
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,435
<i>You know, I guess
I didn't realize</i>

1349
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,270
<i>how much I...</i>

1350
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:58,772
Merry Christmas!

1351
00:48:58,813 --> 00:49:00,982
Sorry we stole Emma
from you this year.

1352
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,234
Well, here I was,

1353
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:05,695
worried that you were crying
in your colossal cocoa,

1354
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:07,364
but you... you look to be okay.

1355
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:10,200
I better go,

1356
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:11,576
but give everyone a hug for me,

1357
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,745
and...

1358
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,205
thanks for calling.

1359
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:18,124
'Kay.

1360
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:21,503
Coming!

1361
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:32,347
[♪♪]

1362
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:36,142
Oh, what beautiful houses!

1363
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:38,770
Oh, here you go.

1364
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,647
- Oh, thank you!
- Welcome!

1365
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,232
Merry Christmas!

1366
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:46,444
Long time no see.

1367
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:47,529
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

1368
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:49,715
We're just teaching the kids

1369
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:51,741
about building
strong foundations...

1370
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:52,992
While keeping it fun.

1371
00:49:53,034 --> 00:49:54,035
Mm-hmm.

1372
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,262
Hoping Emma sees
how fun it would be

1373
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:57,706
for all of us to, you
know, work together.

1374
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:58,998
Yeah. It would be amazing

1375
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,292
to get your expertise
on the renovation.

1376
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:03,753
Okay, I see what's going on...

1377
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,088
It's a tag team.

1378
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,549
Listen, I appreciate
the opportunity,

1379
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:08,591
I really do,

1380
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:09,926
but...

1381
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,637
- I've got a job in Chicago...
- [phone ringing]

1382
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,055
and a life there...

1383
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,056
The logistics...

1384
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,242
It would just be so complicated.

1385
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,059
What if I hired your firm?

1386
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,937
I mean, I'm sure they
take on outside cases.

1387
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:22,647
I mean, they do...

1388
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,606
but...

1389
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:24,816
Um...

1390
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:26,043
Christmas lights are
out at the lodge again,

1391
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:27,694
and Gordon's off
for Christmas Eve,

1392
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,529
so I'm gonna go fix that.

1393
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,780
I'll go.

1394
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:32,657
No! You just got here.

1395
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,410
- Stay and mingle.
- Yeah.

1396
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,370
Come on in. Have some food.

1397
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:38,580
Okay.

1398
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,126
Aunt Martha just called.

1399
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:45,253
She's not feeling
up to the party.

1400
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,535
Would you mind bringing her
some of my Christmas pudding?

1401
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:50,967
Right now?

1402
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,552
She really loves my
Christmas pudding.

1403
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,556
Unless someone else
wants to volunteer...

1404
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,266
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1405
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,061
Yeah, Mom, it's just...

1406
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:03,897
I'm so busy with the
gingerbread houses.

1407
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:05,190
They look finished.

1408
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:07,567
Um... you know what,

1409
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:08,818
I can...

1410
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,488
I can swing by on my
way back from the lodge.

1411
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:13,031
No. No. It's okay.

1412
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:13,990
You don't have to do that.

1413
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:15,575
I will go with you.

1414
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:16,618
Strength in numbers.

1415
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:19,120
Now, that's the
Christmas spirit!

1416
00:51:22,707 --> 00:51:24,501
[Emma] Why are you
so good to my family?

1417
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:26,753
Well, because they're
so good to me.

1418
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,296
Do you miss living next door?

1419
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:29,172
Yeah!

1420
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,274
I miss how close we all were.

1421
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,675
Yeah, we didn't
even have to knock.

1422
00:51:31,716 --> 00:51:33,259
Yeah.

1423
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:35,637
Although I live, like,
five minutes away,

1424
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:36,763
so...

1425
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,390
it's really cool.

1426
00:51:39,432 --> 00:51:41,935
I wish you were a little
bit closer, though.

1427
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:42,936
Yeah, well,

1428
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:44,312
you still got Sarah, right?

1429
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,855
Sarah?

1430
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,565
Uh, yeah. I guess.

1431
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:49,943
I mean, yeah, she's really nice.

1432
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:51,861
Oh, I took one of
her cooking classes

1433
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:53,363
at the lodge,

1434
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,633
and I learned how to make
vegan pesto and creamy polenta,

1435
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:56,616
and, actually...

1436
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:58,827
it wasn't that bad.

1437
00:51:58,868 --> 00:51:59,911
You hate cooking,

1438
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,621
and your favorite
food is beef jerky.

1439
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,622
That's true,

1440
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,124
but, um,

1441
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:06,418
you know, she doesn't really
know many people here, so...

1442
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:08,878
Okay.

1443
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,981
You were just trying
to be welcoming.

1444
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,423
You're a good guy.

1445
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:12,882
Yeah. Just being a friend.

1446
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:16,428
I think she might think you're
more than friends, but...

1447
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:19,180
Well, she's not really my type.

1448
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:21,141
I...

1449
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:22,475
I much prefer...

1450
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,478
the smart...

1451
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,814
completely stubborn type...

1452
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:29,024
with...

1453
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,692
you know, pointy ears.

1454
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,907
Well, I would say maybe

1455
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:40,201
confident rather than stubborn.

1456
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,038
You know what they say...

1457
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:44,497
believe in your "elf".

1458
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:45,790
[Drew laughs]

1459
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,792
You're throwing out elf jokes?

1460
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:48,710
I'll be here all night.

1461
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:50,211
I hope so.

1462
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:53,715
I'm-I'm-I'm blocked in.

1463
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:55,675
My SUV.

1464
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:56,801
Oh! Oh.

1465
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:58,362
Well, why don't we
just take your truck?

1466
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:00,180
It's in your parents'
garage, right?

1467
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:02,474
See, what did I say? Smart.

1468
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:06,478
[chuckles]

1469
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:09,689
There she is...

1470
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:11,399
the one and only.

1471
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:12,734
Yeah.

1472
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,253
My Dad and I spent four
years on the restoration.

1473
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:15,320
I remember.

1474
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,364
Didn't realize how
much I missed her.

1475
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:22,077
Now, can you please
take off that tie?

1476
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:24,579
You cannot drive a truck
like this in a tie.

1477
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,668
Yes, ma'am.

1478
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:31,586
[woman] All right, let's see it.

1479
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:34,547
All right...

1480
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:36,257
focus.

1481
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:38,343
A wilted Christmas tree?

1482
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:39,344
[man] Jumping?

1483
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:40,804
[Will] A Christmas
contortionist!

1484
00:53:40,845 --> 00:53:42,472
Ten seconds.

1485
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:46,768
- Candy cane!
- Yes!

1486
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,441
Okay, okay.

1487
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,693
Um...

1488
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:56,069
Reindeer!

1489
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:56,986
[man] A donkey!

1490
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,822
[Max] Rudolph!

1491
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,532
Baby reindeer!

1492
00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:01,616
Uh...

1493
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,577
A...

1494
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,662
Santa Claus!

1495
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:09,624
Um, uh... okay, okay.

1496
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:14,629
Guys, come on. I'm on a shelf.

1497
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:15,671
No talking!

1498
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:19,175
Snow globe?

1499
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:20,760
An elf! I'm an elf!

1500
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:21,803
Our team wins!

1501
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:26,641
All right...

1502
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:27,809
I suck.

1503
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,190
I can't believe we lost.

1504
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:36,776
I'm usually so good at charades.

1505
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:38,278
You know, statistically,

1506
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,739
you only win charades
about 50% of the time.

1507
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:43,575
So many variables with
the subject matter.

1508
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:45,618
At least we're not in charge

1509
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,454
of saving Ivory-Billed
Woodpeckers.

1510
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:49,581
At least.

1511
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:52,375
I'm going to go
get the hot cocoa.

1512
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,878
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1513
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:56,338
[phone rings]

1514
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:02,802
- Hello?
<i>- Emma.</i>

1515
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:04,054
It's Bob Heaton.

1516
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:05,156
Listen, sorry to bother
you on Christmas Eve,

1517
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,139
but I have good news.

1518
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,058
Um, okay. About what?

1519
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:10,018
The Florida clients loved
your clubhouse model.

1520
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,604
They're going to send over the
paperwork after the holiday.

1521
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:14,522
Okay!

1522
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:15,815
When do I go to Miami?

1523
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:19,069
Oh...

1524
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,212
sorry, no, we're not actually
sending you to Florida.

1525
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,505
We need you in the
office working on it.

1526
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:22,989
<i>Oh... but I thought...</i>

1527
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,866
It's just more efficient...

1528
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:27,327
and then you can start
working on the next project.

1529
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,371
You're getting so good
at these models, Emma.

1530
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:30,747
Keep it up.

1531
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:37,711
[sighs]

1532
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,593
Everything okay?

1533
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:44,844
Yeah...

1534
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:47,514
I guess I just thought
I'd be more involved.

1535
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,033
It sounds like I'm gonna
be stuck in the office,

1536
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:50,225
rather than on the ground.

1537
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:52,394
Hopefully, it's a quiet office.

1538
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:53,937
You know how I love
a quiet office.

1539
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:55,689
Oh, me too.

1540
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,732
I guess I just thought
I'd be there, you know,

1541
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:59,442
to bring the project to life.

1542
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:02,070
Here. Something to
make you feel better.

1543
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:04,864
I figured you were a plain
hot chocolate kind of person.

1544
00:56:04,906 --> 00:56:06,300
Who needs all those
bells and whistles

1545
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,493
when the cocoa is
sourced ethically?

1546
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:10,995
Yeah, totally.

1547
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,248
I'm going to get the cake.

1548
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:15,041
- Oh.
- Do you want help?

1549
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,751
No. I'm okay. Thanks.

1550
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,687
[♪♪]

1551
00:56:42,944 --> 00:56:44,070
Who wants cake?

1552
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,822
Is that a Yule log?

1553
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:47,949
Oh!

1554
00:56:50,076 --> 00:56:51,077
Oh, no.

1555
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,454
No, no, no, no.

1556
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,753
Oh, I am so, so sorry!

1557
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:01,046
You know what.

1558
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:02,087
That's not going to help.

1559
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:03,923
I just... I feel terrible.

1560
00:57:03,965 --> 00:57:05,050
It's okay. Really.

1561
00:57:05,091 --> 00:57:07,469
I... never wear the
same dress twice.

1562
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,932
I should just... go.

1563
00:57:12,974 --> 00:57:14,768
No, Emma. Come on.

1564
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:15,602
It's just...

1565
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:16,770
it's just an accident.

1566
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:17,979
Totally. It's just a dress.

1567
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:21,191
But I think I'll go freshen up.

1568
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:22,275
Yeah.

1569
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:23,234
I'll grab some more paper towel,

1570
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,861
- help clean up.
- Excuse me.

1571
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:27,989
[sighs]

1572
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:31,802
I wanted you to have
the perfect party

1573
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:34,120
and I completely ruined it.

1574
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:35,622
You didn't ruin it. Emma.

1575
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:38,124
I should really go.

1576
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,125
Are you sure?

1577
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:40,210
Yeah.

1578
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:41,670
It's for the best anyways.

1579
00:57:41,711 --> 00:57:43,871
I've gotta finish packing
for my flight in the morning.

1580
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,509
I'll grab your coat.

1581
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:54,641
[Drew] Yeah, definitely
no Christmas lights.

1582
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:56,685
There are so many
memories here, huh?

1583
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,813
Oh, yeah.

1584
00:57:59,854 --> 00:58:01,648
All those years on the ski team.

1585
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:03,775
The bonfires...

1586
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:04,484
Mm.

1587
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,027
The starry nights.

1588
00:58:07,153 --> 00:58:09,364
There's something about
this little mountain town.

1589
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,742
There's a reason why people
say there's no place like home.

1590
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:13,952
Mm-hmm.

1591
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,370
You're happy in
the city, though?

1592
00:58:15,412 --> 00:58:17,455
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

1593
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:19,124
It's busy, it's fun...

1594
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:20,458
Mm-hmm.

1595
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,960
Yeah.

1596
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,004
You never thought
about leaving, huh?

1597
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:25,755
Oh, not really.

1598
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,549
I mean, my family's here.

1599
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:29,092
I've got a good job, you know?

1600
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:30,635
Life is good.

1601
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,805
Only thing I'm missing is...

1602
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:38,184
- [chuckles]
- What?

1603
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:39,477
You know, it doesn't matter.

1604
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,021
You...

1605
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:44,065
you made it clear in school
that you weren't interested, so.

1606
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:48,361
Pardon me? What are you...

1607
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:49,487
What are you talking about?

1608
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:51,698
Come on, you know I
had a crush on you.

1609
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,116
Yeah, you did not.

1610
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,200
- Come on!
- I did!

1611
00:58:54,242 --> 00:58:55,493
Yes, I did.

1612
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:57,037
[laughs]

1613
00:59:01,374 --> 00:59:02,709
Why didn't you say anything?

1614
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:04,210
Well, for a long time,

1615
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:05,628
I was...

1616
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,255
I was afraid of,

1617
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,607
you know, ruining
our friendship...

1618
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:09,507
and then...

1619
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:10,884
then you hurt your knee...

1620
00:59:10,925 --> 00:59:15,055
and then you went to prom
with Basketball Bobby.

1621
00:59:15,096 --> 00:59:15,972
[laughs]

1622
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:19,642
Well, his name is Brian, but...

1623
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:24,647
I mean, I only went with
him because he asked.

1624
00:59:25,523 --> 00:59:26,816
I barely knew the guy.

1625
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:29,110
I... I didn't know that.

1626
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,424
Yeah, I guess we didn't
really talk about our feelings

1627
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:34,949
much then, did we?

1628
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:38,745
No, not really.

1629
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,915
Anyway, and then you...

1630
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:42,916
went to college,

1631
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:44,626
and I didn't want
to hold you back.

1632
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,354
You know, I knew you were
going to be somebody,

1633
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:48,004
and, um...

1634
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:51,091
I...

1635
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:53,885
I didn't know if you
felt the same way.

1636
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:02,686
We should probably...

1637
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:05,271
get to the lights.

1638
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,231
I'm sure your guests
are getting restless.

1639
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:07,774
Yeah.

1640
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:14,989
Is it working?

1641
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:17,450
No.

1642
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,036
Try jiggling the cord.

1643
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:23,790
The...

1644
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:28,461
[♪♪]

1645
01:00:28,503 --> 01:00:29,838
[Drew] Now?

1646
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:32,048
Yeah!

1647
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,133
Yeah! Come look!

1648
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,802
What? It worked?

1649
01:00:39,222 --> 01:00:40,932
Oh, yeah!

1650
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,396
This place is so great.

1651
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:47,689
You know, I mean,

1652
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,025
it really doesn't even
need that much work.

1653
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,317
Hypothetically,

1654
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,653
you know, what kinds of
things are you thinking?

1655
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:54,571
Okay...

1656
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:56,281
- well, if..
- If, yeah.

1657
01:00:56,322 --> 01:00:57,907
If I did the renovation,

1658
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:59,117
I would open up the foyer

1659
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,286
to create a proper
front-desk area,

1660
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:02,662
definitely add some skylights

1661
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,873
to allow that beautiful
southern light to flow in,

1662
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:05,707
and...

1663
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,791
it's seriously lacking

1664
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:07,667
some sort of outdoor
hot tub area...

1665
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:08,501
Oh! Oh!

1666
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:10,879
Like a stage for live music!

1667
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,298
Did you just come up with
that off the top of your head?

1668
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:15,425
Yeah!

1669
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:16,736
See, this is what
I'm talking about!

1670
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,845
Think of what you could
do if you took the job.

1671
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,263
You know, I mean, like,

1672
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:21,723
that is if you...

1673
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,975
like, if you wanted to be here.

1674
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:30,357
[♪♪]

1675
01:01:30,398 --> 01:01:32,025
Wow!

1676
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,902
You really lit up the place!

1677
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:36,696
Gordon. Hey. You're here.

1678
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:38,198
Yeah.

1679
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:42,077
Thanks for coming in.

1680
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:44,496
Okay!

1681
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:46,206
Yeah! You two...

1682
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:47,207
You two, have fun.

1683
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:48,375
I don't wanna...

1684
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:50,293
I don't wanna spoil
your... Your evening.

1685
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:51,461
I'm just gonna go...

1686
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:52,962
make snow angels.

1687

[♪♪]

1688
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:04,349
- Aunt Martha.
- Aunt Martha.

1689
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:09,854
Maybe she's not home.

1690
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,398
We can just leave this and go.

1691
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:13,149
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

1692
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,487
Aunt Martha!

1693
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,655
You look amazing!

1694
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,156
Carolers! At last!

1695
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:21,866
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1696
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:23,827
It's me. It's your
great niece, Emma.

1697
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:25,245
Sing, Child!

1698
01:02:25,286 --> 01:02:26,329

'Cause we're just here for...

I'm 85 years old.

How long do you plan
on keeping me waiting?

1702
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:32,419
What do you wanna sing?

1703
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,771
Uh, I don't want...
I don't want to sing.

1704
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:34,814
- "Jingle Bells"?

I'm a terrible singer.

1712
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,101
Why won't she just
take the pudding?

I am freezing my tootsies off!

I was horrible,
you were great...

01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:51,956
As usual.

1738
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:53,017
I was inspired by somebody.

1739
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,376
You know, Aunt Martha.

1740
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:58,880
Thank you.

1741
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:02,050
So I had a really
good time today.

1742
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,552
Yeah, I did, too,

1743
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,888
until a cake literally fell
into your friend's lap.

1744
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:09,140
It was kind of funny.

1745
01:04:09,182 --> 01:04:11,351
But I will deny that under oath.

1746
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:12,393
[laughs]

1747
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:15,397
Think about tomorrow.

1748
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:17,833
We meet at the airport
in the morning.

1749
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:19,150
I'll text you the details.

1750
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:20,527
Okay?

1751
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,070
Okay.

1752
01:04:24,197 --> 01:04:26,408
I mean, it kind of would
be a waste, wouldn't it?

1753
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:33,248
[♪♪]

1754
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:40,630
Remember that time

1755
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,590
when you had to
drive the Zamboni

1756
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:44,050
after hockey practice?

1757
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:45,218
[Drew] Oh, my gosh.

1758
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,929
I had no idea how to
operate that thing.

1759
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:50,241
[Emma] I mean, you
can drive a truck.

1760
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,808
How did it go with Aunt Martha?

1761
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,519
Um, better than expected.

1762
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:57,355
Uh... don't make me
do that again, Mom.

1763
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:58,749
[Mom] Even though
she doesn't say it,

1764
01:04:58,773 --> 01:05:00,442
I know she appreciates it.

1765
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:03,194
But does she?

1766
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,122
Drew...

1767
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:15,307
it sounds like Deena and John

1768
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:16,851
might be in for the
next cooking class.

1769
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,376
Oh, that's great.

1770
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,604
Though you still seem to be
the only one who wants vegan.

1771
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:21,755
Ah...

1772
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:22,857
well, you know what
I always say...

1773
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,466
Tofurkey is underrated.

1774
01:05:24,507 --> 01:05:25,967
You never say that.

1775
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:29,929
I'm gonna grab another drink.

1776
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:31,181
Do you want a hot cider?

1777
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:32,766
Um, sure.

1778
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:34,351
Thank you. Yeah.

1779
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:37,353
Tofurkey, huh?

1780
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:39,481
Wow.

1781
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,792
I'm just making conversation.

1782
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:43,109
Oh, and you don't like cider.

1783
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:44,944
I thought you guys
were just friends?

1784
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:46,071
We are.

1785
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:47,423
Well, then why try
to change yourself?

1786
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:49,407
I'm not trying to change myself.

1787
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:50,450
I'm trying...

1788
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:52,494
It's called trying
something new.

1789
01:05:52,535 --> 01:05:53,846
Sarah wants to do a cooking
school at the lodge,

1790
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:55,455
and I'm trying to support her,

1791
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:56,456
because, apparently,

1792
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:57,457
vegan's a tough
sell around here,

1793
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,042
so just doing some test classes.

1794
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:00,960
What about Joanna?

1795
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:01,836
Remember?

1796
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:03,022
She really liked mountain men,

1797
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:04,673
so you grew this
big, scraggly beard?

1798
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:05,757
So what?

1799
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:06,841
I manscaped.

1800
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:07,943
Uh-huh. And then
there was Heather.

1801
01:06:07,967 --> 01:06:10,303
She really wanted
you to get an SUV.

1802
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:11,554
Yeah, but I...

1803
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:12,657
Well, that's because I
like the heated seats

1804
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:13,682
and the sport mode.

1805
01:06:13,723 --> 01:06:14,825
Then there was the
guitar, the tie...

1806
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:16,476
And what, now you're vegan?

1807
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:18,770
Okay, okay...

1808
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:20,063
The way I see it,

1809
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,499
relationships are about
give and take, right?

1810
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,066
They're about
trying something new

1811
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:25,819
that maybe you wouldn't
have tried otherwise.

1812
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,112
Really? Because I think

1813
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:27,821
you're just trying to
get somebody's attention.

1814
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:29,531
Yeah, maybe I am.

1815
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,035
I... you know what,

1816
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,870
I joined the ski club
because I liked you.

1817
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:37,515
It was still the best
decision I ever made,

1818
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:38,933
because I got to know
the Roberts family,

1819
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:40,625
and I found my
purpose in the lodge,

1820
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,544
and I'm still mostly me.

1821
01:06:43,878 --> 01:06:44,879
Whereas, you, Emma,

1822
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:46,631
you have changed so much.

1823
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:47,590
It's like you're trying to be

1824
01:06:47,632 --> 01:06:48,633
this...

1825
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:50,176
this fancy version of yourself

1826
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:52,762
that likes plain cocoa.

1827
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:53,823
I know you don't
like plan cocoa!

1828
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,348
I know you like colossal cocoa.

1829
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,224
So...

1830
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,059
so what are you trying to prove?

1831
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,061
Who are you doing that for?

1832
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,439
Because I know it's not for you.

1833
01:07:03,648 --> 01:07:04,566
I don't get it.

1834
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:06,151
I thought we had
a moment earlier.

1835
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:12,407
I'm sorry, I'm tired of
waiting for you to see me.

1836
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:20,331
Wait! Drew, come on...

1837
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:35,472
[♪♪]

1838
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:39,642
[knocking]

1839
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:40,935
Hey.

1840
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:42,103
Party's winding down.

1841
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:45,982
I think I'm just going
to hang out up here.

1842
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:48,109
I'll make less of
a mess that way.

1843
01:07:50,779 --> 01:07:53,490
Everything's falling apart, Dad.

1844
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:54,532
Oh, come on,

1845
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:56,701
the gingerbread
houses look great.

1846
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:01,581
Dad, Drew was right.

1847
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,502
I feel like I'm just...

1848
01:08:05,543 --> 01:08:08,088
I'm placing these
crazy expectations

1849
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:10,715
on everything and everyone.

1850
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:14,969
It's like if nothing fits
into my perfect blueprint,

1851
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:16,596
if anything goes
outside the line,

1852
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,264
then...

1853
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:21,309
nothing works out.

1854
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,646
In a lot of ways,
life is a blueprint...

1855
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:27,857
You've got to have plans,

1856
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,609
know where you're going...

1857
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:34,739
but one thing I've learned
being a contractor...

1858
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:35,907
You've got to be ready

1859
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,134
for anything that
comes your way.

1860
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:40,245
Life is a series of adjustments.

1861
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:43,289
What matters most...

1862
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:45,792
is building the
best house you can

1863
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,335
with what you've got.

1864
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,880
But I just wanted to come home
and tell you that I did it.

1865
01:08:50,922 --> 01:08:53,008
You know, that...

1866
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:54,968
that I was a success.

1867
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:57,345
That I could do it on my own.

1868
01:08:57,387 --> 01:08:59,305
But...

1869
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,308
I didn't get the
Miami project, Dad.

1870
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,893
I messed up the model.

1871
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,270
I completely blew it.

1872
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:07,313
I let you down.

1873
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:09,983
I'm so sorry.

1874
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,443
What are you talking about?

1875
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:16,531
You could never let
me down, peanut.

1876
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,163
I always knew you would
be a great architect

1877
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:26,082
because you're smarter
than your old man...

1878
01:09:26,124 --> 01:09:28,209
and you've got the talent.

1879
01:09:29,085 --> 01:09:32,213
But don't do it for me.

1880
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:36,343
The most important thing
is that you're happy.

1881
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:42,849
Do you remember

1882
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:44,684
when you lost that
downhill championship

1883
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:45,685
when you were 14?

1884
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:47,020
Yeah.

1885
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,688
That's the day I
blew out my knee.

1886
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,482
I was not happy.

1887
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:52,692
No.

1888
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,736
But do you remember
what you did after?

1889
01:09:56,196 --> 01:09:57,697
Yeah, I did those
knee exercises.

1890
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,991
Every. Day.

1891
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:02,577
For a whole year.

1892
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:07,415
And Drew was the
one pushing you.

1893
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:12,253
Yeah, he was.

1894
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:15,465
And then you came back

1895
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:18,718
and won that championship
the very next year.

1896
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:21,096
That was a good day.

1897
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:22,817
- That was a good day.
- It was a good day.

1898
01:10:22,847 --> 01:10:24,224
But, you know...

1899
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:28,728
the best part wasn't seeing
you up on that podium...

1900
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,356
it was watching you race.

1901
01:10:32,273 --> 01:10:35,318
After all that hard
work you put in,

1902
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,279
you were out there
just doing it for you.

1903
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:40,990
And those are the moments

1904
01:10:41,032 --> 01:10:43,451
that make being a
parent so special.

1905
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:48,415
Maybe it's time for you to
start following your heart.

1906
01:10:49,874 --> 01:10:51,292
With everything.

1907
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:54,462
And do it for you.

1908
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:57,674
'Cause you deserve it.

1909
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:01,302
Thanks, Dad.

1910
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,811
Hi, Santa.

1911
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:10,913
Shouldn't you be out
there delivering presents?

1912
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:12,439
The night is still young.

1913
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:14,649
Yeah.

1914
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:16,211
Did you find what
you were looking for?

1915
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:18,653
I don't know yet.

1916
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:21,448
It might be right
in front of you.

1917
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:26,536
Thanks.

1918
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,664
Well... you better
get to work.

1919
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:39,466

1920

my Dad...

1929
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,901
It was all just a dream.

1930
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:46,533
Taxi!

1931
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:54,082
Hi.

1932
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,792
Hi!

1933
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:58,378
You again.

1934
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,213
Hey, have you ever had a dream

1935
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:02,465
that felt so real,

1936
01:13:02,507 --> 01:13:03,967
it was like it
actually happened?

1937
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:05,051
Yeah.

1938
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,302
I had a dream last night

1939
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:08,263
that my first passenger
gave me a giant tip

1940
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:09,597
'cause it's Christmas.

1941
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:11,766
[chuckles]

1942
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:22,027
Okay. Here you go.

1943
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:23,486
What?

1944
01:13:24,863 --> 01:13:25,739
Thanks for the tip!

1945
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,906
Merry Christmas.

1946
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:28,450
Merry Christmas!

1947
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:41,588
Emma. You came!

1948
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:43,590
Max...

1949
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:44,758
I'm so glad you made it.

1950
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:45,842
Um...

1951
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,236
I'm not actually
going on the ski trip.

1952
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,429
I'm going home.

1953
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,847
I'm sorry.

1954
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:53,975
But thank you so much
for the generous offer.

1955
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,478
Of course. Of course.

1956
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,481
We should go out in
the new year, though.

1957
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:02,484
Max, I don't think
I'm the girl for you.

1958
01:14:03,401 --> 01:14:05,320
If I'm being totally
honest with myself

1959
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,781
about where my life is headed

1960
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:09,783
and what I actually want...

1961
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:13,703
it turns out I prefer
dysfunctional family gatherings

1962
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:16,623
to perfect holiday parties.

1963
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:18,832
I get it.

1964
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:21,628
Well, I hope you have

1965
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,505
a wonderful time
with your family.

1966
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:25,882
I'm actually kind of envious.

1967
01:14:28,009 --> 01:14:29,219
Thank you.

1968
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,804
Have a great time
with your friends,

1969
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:31,888
and...

1970
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:33,014
Merry Christmas!

1971
01:14:34,182 --> 01:14:35,767
Merry Christmas, Emma.

[humming]

1973
01:14:40,021 --> 01:14:41,898
I made it!

1974
01:14:44,567 --> 01:14:45,944
Please tell me I'm not too late.

1975
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:47,028
10 minutes to spare.

1976
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:49,239
Oh! Okay.

1977
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,615
Thank you.

It's Emma Peterson.

1981
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:12,137
Hi.

1982
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:13,680
I'm just heading home,

1983
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:16,141
but I was wondering if
you had a second to chat.

1984
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:21,479
[♪♪]

1985
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,023
Merry Christmas, Dad!

Hey!

1987
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:26,735
Oh, peanut!

1988
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:29,279
I cannot tell you how
happy I am to see you!

1989
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,905
[Emma] I'm so happy to be home.

1990
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:33,700
How's Mom?

1991
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,285
Oh, you know your mother.

1992
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:37,037
She's busy cooking up a storm.

1993
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:38,079
Come on, let's go!

1994
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,416
I can't believe,
after all of that,

1995
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,585
your flight ended
up being delayed.

1996
01:15:44,377 --> 01:15:45,253
[Emma] So I got some news.

1997
01:15:45,295 --> 01:15:47,130
Huh?

1998
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:49,716
Shirley Roberts
officially offered me

1999
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:52,052
the Ski Lodge
renovation this morning.

2000
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:53,303
Funny you mention that,

2001
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:55,847
because she offered me
the contractor position.

2002
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:58,558
Yeah, I know.

2003
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,602
Because I wanted
to work with you.

2004
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,164
You're the best
contractor I know.

2005
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,106
Wait... you took it?

2006
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,568
What about the Miami project?

2007
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:12,947
My firm actually chose
my golf clubhouse model.

2008
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:14,240
That's amazing!

2009
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:15,282
And then I resigned.

2010
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:17,452
What?

2011
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:19,245
Why would you do that?

2012
01:16:19,287 --> 01:16:20,497
Because, Dad,

2013
01:16:20,538 --> 01:16:23,083
I want to work where I'm valued.

2014
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:24,793
You know...

2015
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:26,795
making a difference...

2016
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:30,215
Creating something from
scratch and seeing it through.

2017
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:32,342
Then I found out

2018
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:33,343
I was going to be
stuck in the office

2019
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:34,427
making models

2020
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:35,553
while the senior architects

2021
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:37,155
got all the opportunities
on the ground.

2022
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:39,224
I get it.

2023
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:40,517
From Blueprints...

2024
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,686
to Boots on the Ground,

2025
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,020
as we used to say.

2026
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:45,647
Yup!

2027
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:50,777
Hey, you remember when we
also used to talk about

2028
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,487
running our own
business together?

2029
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,406
All your contracting...

2030
01:16:54,447 --> 01:16:56,783
and architectural needs.

2031
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:01,413
So...

2032
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:02,872
how do you feel
about teaming up?

2033
01:17:03,748 --> 01:17:05,625
On the Ski Lodge? Absolutely.

2034
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:07,669
No. I mean permanently.

2035
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,045
[chuckles]

2036
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,383
What?

2037
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:15,135
Are you serious?

2038
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:16,261
Well...

2039
01:17:16,302 --> 01:17:18,304
I can think of nothing
more satisfying

2040
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:21,641
than you bringing me coffee
every morning in our new office.

2041
01:17:21,683 --> 01:17:23,059
[laughing]

2042
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,311
Actually, I think it would
be the other way around.

2043
01:17:25,353 --> 01:17:27,689
Well, I don't know.

2044
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:30,984
Peanut, I love this idea.

2045
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,902
Yeah.

2046
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:34,279
Well...

2047
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,007
sometimes, things happen
the way they're supposed to.

2048
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:39,200
Hey, does Drew know about
this plan of yours yet?

2049
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,953
He doesn't even know I'm home.

2050
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:44,515
I think you should tell him...

2051
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:45,832
And probably in person.

2052
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,208
I know where he is.

2053
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:49,586
Really?

2054
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:50,646
Yeah, they're apparently having

2055
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,339
electrical issues
down at the lodge.

2056
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,215
I could drop you off there?

2057
01:17:56,426 --> 01:17:58,178
Um, yeah. Okay.

2058
01:17:58,219 --> 01:17:59,220
If you don't mind?

2059
01:17:59,262 --> 01:18:00,972
Oh, no. Not at all.

2060
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,726
You know,

2061
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:07,729
I always thought you and
Drew would make a good match.

2062
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,110
[Drew] Nothing yet. Over.

2063
01:18:17,322 --> 01:18:18,990
Okay. Was that it? Over.

2064
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,118
Nope. Keep trying. Over.

2065
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:31,211
Hey! You're here!

2066
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:33,898
Hey, tell Mom I'll be home soon!

2067
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,006
All right. Will do.

2068
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:43,181
The Christmas lights are out.

2069
01:18:43,223 --> 01:18:47,060
It's a breaker
issue, we think...

2070
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:48,520
We hope.

2071
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:50,313
Yeah. We can't have
that on Christmas.

2072
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,065
My thoughts exactly.

2073
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,858
I'm coordinating with Gordon.

2074
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,821
Did you try jiggling the cord?

2075
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:00,198
Hmm.

2076
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,283
Not super technical, but
we can give it a shot.

2077
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:05,745
Gordon, jiggle the cord.

2078
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,163
<i>Over.</i>

2079
01:19:08,289 --> 01:19:10,375
Okay. Jiggling. Over.

2080
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:18,758
[♪♪]

2081
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,801
It worked!

2082
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:21,112
How did you know
that would work?

2083
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:22,887
You're my good-luck charm.

2084
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:24,389
<i>Uh, what about me?</i>

2085
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:25,390
<i>Over.</i>

2086
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:26,808
I'm turning this off.

2087
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:32,313
This feels familiar...

2088
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,943
Drew, you know how you always
call me "Perfect Peterson"?

2089
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:40,113
Yeah. You know
I'm just teasing.

2090
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:41,156
No. I know.

2091
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:42,574
But you're right.

2092
01:19:42,615 --> 01:19:44,826
I'm a perfectionist.

2093
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,203
I plan everything...

2094
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:48,246
From my job,

2095
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:51,124
to the way a Yule
log should taste,

2096
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,334
to...

2097
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:54,336
what I think a perfect
guy should look like.

2098
01:19:55,879 --> 01:19:57,297
You know, in the last 48 hours,

2099
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,007
I thought I met that guy.

2100
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:04,095
And we spent an almost
perfect day together.

2101
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,639
I'm so happy for you.

2102
01:20:06,681 --> 01:20:08,391
No, but I realized

2103
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:09,601
that I want someone

2104
01:20:09,642 --> 01:20:11,811
who pushes me outside
of my comfort zone,

2105
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:14,564
who... who makes life...

2106
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:16,316
unpredictable...

2107
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:17,776
and...

2108
01:20:17,817 --> 01:20:19,652
and fun.

2109
01:20:19,694 --> 01:20:21,237
What are you saying?

2110
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:24,657
I have feelings for you, Drew.

2111
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:27,077
I've always had
feelings for you.

2112
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:31,122
You had a crush on me?

2113
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,501
Yeah!

2114
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:35,710
I mean...

2115
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:37,337
then why didn't
you say anything?

2116
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,091
I don't know...

2117
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:41,966
Because I went away to college,

2118
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:43,009
and the I had...

2119
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,260
this thing inside of me

2120
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:47,597
that thought I had to
be a certain way, and...

2121
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:48,556
I don't know.

2122
01:20:48,598 --> 01:20:50,016
I didn't...

2123
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:52,477
I didn't know if you
felt the same way.

2124
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:57,065
Emma...

2125
01:20:58,733 --> 01:21:02,570
Last night, I realized
how much I miss you,

2126
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:04,072
and it's not just because

2127
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:05,323
I desperately needed

2128
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,075
your expertise with
the gingerbread...

2129
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,577
or that they made
me bring pudding

2130
01:21:09,619 --> 01:21:10,829
to your Aunt Martha's alone,

2131
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:14,082
which I don't think
I'll ever recover from.

2132
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:19,352
Thinking back on all
those Christmases...

2133
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,298
your parents, together...

2134
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:25,927
I salted the driveway...

2135
01:21:26,678 --> 01:21:27,721
I put the lights up,

2136
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:29,180
I got the firewood...

2137
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:33,018
I did all that gladly

2138
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:34,436
because it meant...

2139
01:21:35,603 --> 01:21:37,355
I got to be with you.

2140
01:21:38,064 --> 01:21:40,316
So you had a crush
on me, too, huh?

2141
01:21:40,358 --> 01:21:41,443
[chuckles]

2142
01:21:43,486 --> 01:21:45,030
Isn't that obvious?

2143
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:52,162
Drew, no matter where I go,
you always feel like home.

2144
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:58,460
[♪♪]

2145
01:22:06,676 --> 01:22:11,097
[♪♪]

2146
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,311
That was weird.

2147
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:18,188
Yeah, weird.

2148
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:19,290
Wait, when you said "weird",

2149
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:20,708
did you mean, like,
bad-weird, or...

2150
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:22,108
No, really good-weird.

2151
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:30,116
[♪♪]

2152
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:33,453
Oh! Um...

2153
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,496
I talked to Mrs. Roberts.

2154
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:36,664
I'm gonna do it.

2155
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:38,583
I'm gonna take the
project in Vermont,

2156
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:39,876
I'm gonna team up with my Dad.

2157
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:40,794
Yes!

2158
01:22:40,835 --> 01:22:41,836
That is amazing!

2159
01:22:41,878 --> 01:22:43,463
Yes! I'm so happy for me!

2160
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:44,464
For you.

2161
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:45,965
I'm happy for...

2162
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:47,467
I'm happy for you,
Perfect Peterson.

2163
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:50,053
You know I'm not perfect, right?

2164
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,181
You are to me.

2165
01:22:58,561 --> 01:22:59,938
Um, let's go get your stuff

2166
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:00,855
because we're going to be
late for Christmas dinner.

2167
01:23:00,897 --> 01:23:02,732
[Drew] Oh, yeah. That's right.

2168
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:05,026
- Oh!
- [Emma laughs]

2169
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:09,823
Ow! Who put that there?

2170
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:11,825
I swear that it
came out of nowhere.

2171
01:23:11,866 --> 01:23:15,245
But it was funny!
Just a little bit.

2172
01:23:15,286 --> 01:23:16,496
Ow!

2173
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:18,081
[laughing]

2174
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:37,058
[♪♪]
