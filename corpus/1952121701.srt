1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:20,000
I keep hearing this melody in my ears…

2
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,300
Frosty the Snowman
was a jolly, happy soul

3
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:28,512
With a corncob pipe and a button
nose, and two eyes made out of coal

4
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:32,904
There must have been some magic
in that old felt hat they found

5
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:35,219
For when they placed in on his head…

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,500
- Dude!
- What?

7
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,394
Don't put the magic hat on the snowman.

8
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:43,136
- Why?
- 'Cause if you do, he's gonna come to life.

9
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:44,397
Cool!

10
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,448
No it's not cool! My
sister - in, in Minnesota -

11
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,000
put a hat on a snowman
and it tried to kill her!

12
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,990
- Fuck him, let's do it anyway.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:57,274
There must have been some magic
in that old felt hat they found

14
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,518
For when they placed in on his head…

15
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:21,411
Oh my God! Frosty killed Kenny!

16
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:27,067
Dude, I told you not to put that
fuckin' hat on Frosty's fuckin' head!

17
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,168
Now, didn't I?!

18
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:31,168
Well, I'm sorry, Mr.
Rocket fucking Scientist!

19
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,861
What are we s'posed to do now?

20
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:36,723
I don't know what we're s'posed
to…wait. I bet he can help us

21
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:37,724
Who?

22
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:38,925
Ho ho ho, ho.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,362
Save us! Save us!
Fuckin' save us! Save us!

24
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:45,619
Whoa-whoa. Now, tell me
what happened, slowly.

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,579
Okay. We were just
building a snowman…

26
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,698
and all of a sudden…it came to life…

27
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:52,154
I told him. I said, 'Don't put
the magic hat…on the snowman'

28
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,171
and he did it anyways…and…and
then he killed our friend, Kenny,

29
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,788
and now he's gonna kill everybody!

30
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,960
Did he look kind of like this?

31
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,744
- Yeah, kind of like that…
- Mm-hm, exactly

32
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:12,107
You know, ah-I don't think
that was the real Santa Claus.

33
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,828
Oh, no shit, Sherlock!
You know, thanks to you

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,400
there's not gonna be any Christmas,
and there's no one left to help us.

35
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,234
Oh, Christ!

36
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:23,860
Jesus!

37
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,593
Jesus, we beseech thee
in this time of need…

38
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:39,380
OK. Fucking Frosty, he fuckin' killed…

39
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:43,776
Dude! This is Jesus! You don't
say 'fuck' in front of Jesus!

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
is that so?

41
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:48,822
Go, Jesus!

42
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:10,699
Our Savior!

43
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:18,072
- That sucked.
- I'm sure glad that's over with.

44
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,450
Yeah. But you know, I
learned something today.

45
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,249
Yeah, don't put the magic hat on Frosty!

46
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:26,422
No. I learned about the
true Spirit of Christmas.

47
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:27,215
Really?

48
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:31,195
Yeh. Christmas isn't
about Frosty or Santa…

49
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:34,199
You're right. It's about Jesus.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,772
- No, it's not even about Jesus, either.
- Well, then, what's it all about?

51
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:41,826
Presents.

52
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,351
You see? Presents!

53
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,914
Hey, man. Let's go home. I know
where my parents hide my presents!

54
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,015
- Cool!
- Yeah!

55
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:55,049
…sooo heee waves goodbye,
saying, 'Don't you cry,

56
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,507
I'll be back again someday.
