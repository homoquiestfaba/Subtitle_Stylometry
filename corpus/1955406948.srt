1
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,971
Alright,
on my count, go, go, go.

2
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,517
Clear.

3
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,519
Watch that corner.

4
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,415
Hands, let me see your hands.

5
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,319
Got you...

6
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,769
Stuck up.

7
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,142
Hey, move it, gringo.

8
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,522
- Hey, John.
- Hola, chica.

9
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,482
Do you guys need anything?

10
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,660
Nope, we'll be fine,
thanks, we're cool.

11
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:27,953
You hear that song?

12
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,597
In terms of the latest
narco quarter

13
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,792
that we're interested in,
that was set up by El Mini Oso.

14
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,693
<i>Now, interestingly enough,</i>

15
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,338
<i>it's been taken over</i>
<i>by Felix Camarena.</i>

16
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,699
Oso was an ex-cop who at the
time of Camarena's first arrest

17
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:43,344
ran the Puento Grande
Mexican prison.

18
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,747
Oso made sure to help set up
Camarena's first prison break.

19
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:49,708
I'm not sure who helped him
the second time around really.

20
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,553
But Camarena did
return the favor.

21
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,955
In February, my team
raided his compound.

22
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,716
<i>As you may, or may not,</i>
<i>know when we got in there</i>

23
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:02,154
<i>we encountered severe resistance,
got into a big gun fight.</i>

24
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:06,526
<i>I ended up killing El Mini Oso.</i>

25
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,380
<i>We had 200 million dollars</i>
<i>in cash, some Euros,</i>

26
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:24,610
<i>over 100 big exotic cats,
200 firearms, most of them FA,</i>

27
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,421
and 150 tons of cocaine.

28
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:31,658
- I ended that motherfucker.
- That's why I'm here, John.

29
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:33,093
You killed the bear.

30
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,721
I don't need to tell you
about your reputation

31
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,598
on both sides of the law.

32
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,025
The cartels know that you're
someone to be reckoned with

33
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,570
and the FBI and ICE
know that as a purported agent

34
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:46,699
of the DEA, you're also
in bed with the CIA.

35
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,236
Do you need to get that?

36
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,713
Fuck no.

37
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:56,750
Look, I'm here,
off the books, because I need to

38
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,010
reactivate a cold asset.

39
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:01,981
My brother, if I get back in,
there's 1,000 motherfuckers

40
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,092
that are gonna die,
good guys and bad guys,

41
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,628
and I'm gonna end up
being the bad guy,

42
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,962
and I don't want that.

43
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,724
In the past several weeks
ICE has been picking up

44
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,736
more and more OTM's along
Sonora smuggling routes.

45
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:17,796
<i>ICE runs across</i>
<i>them all the time.</i>

46
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,266
<i>Mexicans being smuggled
in all the time.</i>

47
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,735
<i>Nuh-uh, not like this.</i>

48
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,707
<i>Two days ago ICE picked up two
OTM's along the Texas border.</i>

49
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,719
This close to making it across.

50
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:35,548
But your Native American friends
working the routes that night

51
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:37,783
<i>noticed something</i>
<i>different about these two.</i>

52
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,286
<i>Let me guess,</i>
<i>you got a hit on an OTM.</i>

53
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:43,797
Two hits. Two known
Islamic extremists, John.

54
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,125
Two of the three main players
responsible for blowing

55
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,929
Crimea A-450 out of the
sky over Syria last year.

56
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:11,124
As you know the CIA in concert
with the DEA and the FBI

57
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,093
have been after these animals.

58
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,753
Each belong to
different groups though.

59
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:17,990
Split between Al-Nusra Front
and Hezbollah.

60
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:21,961
So you're talking high level,
high value targets.

61
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:25,672
Wow.
I'm interested, tell me more.

62
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,641
DOJ has reasons to
believe that these guys

63
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:29,335
are attempting to form
an unholy alliance

64
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,812
with the narco terrorists
along our borders.

65
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:34,006
Same cartels that create
men like El Mini Oso.

66
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,808
Now the agreement
is simple in theory.

67
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,519
Their caliphate will supply
the cartels if the cartels

68
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,679
use their smuggling routes
to sneak terrorist cells

69
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:42,556
into the US undetected.

70
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:45,184
The FBI doesn't want it
and the CIA can't do anything

71
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:48,161
about it once they
land on US soil.

72
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:50,163
And that leaves the DEA.

73
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,767
And that brings you to me.

74
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,794
You're the best
wet mechanic out there, John,

75
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,765
and a very unique asset,
straddling both worlds,

76
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,667
the CIA and the DEA.

77
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:09,249
Okay, so, I'm gonna
need something actionable.

78
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,877
There is a meeting taking place
marking the marriage

79
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:14,922
between these groups,
making it official.

80
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,949
Where is the
meeting taking place?

81
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,083
Neutral ground.

82
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,794
But the exact location,
we don't know.

83
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,888
Stay and drink with us, baby.

84
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,613
Don't be shy.

85
00:10:29,861 --> 00:10:31,897
Okay, so here's the deal.

86
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:35,876
If I'm coming in to do this,
I need resources.

87
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,813
I want to pick my own team,
I want my own equipment,

88
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:44,376
my own gear, and I'll need a jet
to tote me and my team around.

89
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,787
So I guess you're back.

90
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,156
My account info,
same as usual.

91
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,117
And I want to talk
to the OTM tonight.

92
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:54,286
Now if you'll excuse me.

93
00:10:58,148 --> 00:10:59,425
Just stay, relax.

94
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:07,107
- Hey, Maria, Maria.
- Hi, papi.

95
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:09,902
- How's my baby.
- Who's this guy?

96
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:12,913
- How's my baby girl?
- Not that good.

97
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:13,739
Not that good,
what's happening?

98
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,882
- Because of them.
- Really?

99
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,242
Hey, who the fuck are you?

100
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,311
Do you guys know
this is my baby?

101
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:20,746
You're baby?

102
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,325
But you know what,
it seems to me...

103
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,385
Seems that what?

104
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,154
- Is this your beer?
- Yeah.

105
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,964
Hey,<i>ese.</i>

106
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:31,957
He took your beer, man.

107
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:35,936
It seems to me that
you're bothering her.

108
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,473
Stay down, bitch.

109
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,971
I was never here.
You understand that right?

110
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,990
<i>Hello.</i>

111
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:39,958
<i>Zara, it's me.</i>

112
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,470
<i>John, wow,
it's been a long time.</i>

113
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:47,340
<i>How's Mexico or wherever</i>
<i>you're living these days?</i>

114
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,235
<i>I'm coming back home,</i>
<i>good old USA.</i>

115
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,038
<i>I need your help for something.</i>

116
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:01,113
Alright let's try an easy one.
Where are you from?

117
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:27,214
Okay, I see you
recognize the word.

118
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,518
So, probably you didn't
count on me grabbing you.

119
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:34,112
And because you were trained
to sit tight and not say

120
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:37,324
a word, then you'll probably
be kicked loose by dawn

121
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,617
because that's where our current

122
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:43,130
administration
makes all of us act.

123
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,026
You didn't count on my Native
American brothers grabbing you,

124
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:50,871
<i>and I'm sure they</i>
<i>took one look at you</i>

125
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,431
<i>and saw you a mile away.</i>

126
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,174
You're an Arab.

127
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,035
You're no Mexican.

128
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,884
Your clothes ill-fitting.

129
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,486
Eh, you look kind of
Yemeni with a neck scarf.

130
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,546
But your friend
from the other room,

131
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,082
he's not from there is he?

132
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,054
Of course you do,
he's already rolled on you.

133
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,534
How do you think
I know you're Yemeni. You know?

134
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,197
He tells me that the Al-Qaeda
and the Arabian peninsula

135
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,574
are very active.

136
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,203
But you guys aren't
usually found hanging out

137
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,238
with the Al-Nusra Front.

138
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:37,884
AQAP working with Daish, yeah?

139
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,855
This tells me that you
and your pal aren't really

140
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,549
trial running anything
to set up smuggling routes.

141
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:49,029
This tells me
you're forward negotiators

142
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,058
setting the stage for something
big that's about to happen.

143
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,536
I do not speak English.

144
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,039
Man that's some funny shit.

145
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:03,043
I also know who caught
the eye of the border agents

146
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,670
when they nabbed you guys.

147
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:08,206
See, Native Americans
are experts at tracking

148
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,084
and...
and the thing of it is

149
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,413
you weren't sneaking in
from Mexico to the US.

150
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,984
<i>You were sneaking out of</i>
<i>the US into Mexico.</i>

151
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,585
<i>You were already here.</i>

152
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,723
So tell me your name,

153
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:28,335
tell me the name
of your contact in Mexico

154
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,262
and finally tell me exactly

155
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,266
where the real meeting
is taking place and when.

156
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:45,552
My name is Abdulah Al-Hamdani.

157
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:50,515
Our contact in Mexico is the
head of the Sonora drug cartel.

158
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,187
<i>He wanted to show us his</i>
<i>southern border operations.</i>

159
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,331
<i>So you were kind of</i>
<i>inspecting the routes, right?</i>

160
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:07,507
<i>For the corridors?</i>

161
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:10,502
<i>We were making
an alliance of convenience.</i>

162
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:12,371
<i>Yeah, I understand that.</i>

163
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:18,385
Mexico isn't really interesting
enough without AQAP and Daish.

164
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,245
We have enough
desert back home.

165
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,381
Yes, you do,
and that's why I know

166
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,157
you're still lying to me.

167
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,251
You're here for an
easier way into the US.

168
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,387
Something with less eyes on it.

169
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,563
<i>With more sand.</i>

170
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:34,601
<i>Something further away,
but still a hub, a port,</i>

171
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>with a history of trafficking</i>
<i>as well as religion.</i>

172
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:42,275
Your contact in Mexico
was Jose Rivera.

173
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,112
But that's not where the
meeting is taking place.

174
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,773
How do you know his name?

175
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:50,275
Rivera's the head
of Sonora cartel.

176
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,988
And if you're making a deal with
any cartel, it's with Sonora.

177
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:58,216
<i>You want the access to</i>
<i>their extensive rain time,</i>

178
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:01,720
<i>subterranean land</i>
<i>and air smuggling route.</i>

179
00:17:01,845 --> 00:17:05,758
And you like the fact
that they're brutal.

180
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:14,541
Rivera's expanding into Turkey.

181
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,145
How could you
possibly know that?

182
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,741
'Cause I've been in Mexico
for a long time working Rivera.

183
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:26,144
He hasn't been in Mexico,
he's been in Turkey.

184
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,282
And he's been taking out
all the heroin godfathers

185
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,193
<i>one by one by one.</i>

186
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,469
<i>You see a storm's coming.</i>

187
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:21,366
So other than a switch from
the Agency to the Bureau,

188
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,302
you haven't changed a bit
since last time I saw you.

189
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:27,172
I could say the same
thing about you, John.

190
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:29,582
Still wearing the Rolex.

191
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:34,479
Yeah, it's platinum. I got this
from finest girl I ever had.

192
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:38,383
- Yeah, from me.
- Yeah, it was you.

193
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:46,158
- How you been?
- I'm alright. You know me.

194
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:49,135
Yeah, I know you.

195
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,496
So, you really
think this meeting

196
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:55,075
is taking place in
Istanbul and not Mexico?

197
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,277
I mean, I never
really believe intel.

198
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,904
You believe intel,
we used to say,

199
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:01,473
and that's the key
to death, you know.

200
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:06,244
You can never trust intel.
But that's what they say.

201
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,322
Okay.
I'll write it up and pass it

202
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,158
on over to our old CIA contacts.

203
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,885
Baby, that's not
why I asked you to come.

204
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,422
I was thinking I might get
you to come back on my team.

205
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,291
Oh, I figured...

206
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,702
You've been reactivated.

207
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:26,339
We need one more person to
complete our three-man team.

208
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,533
Better if somebody's
kind of internal,

209
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:33,813
maybe with Agency connections,
not really DEA or FBI.

210
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:37,250
What do you propose we do?
This three-man team of yours.

211
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,844
You know we find folks,
we interview 'em.

212
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:42,822
If we like 'em we give
'em a box of chocolates.

213
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:44,382
If we don't, we kill 'em.

214
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:47,386
- And then?
- And then...

215
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,464
I will do my thing.

216
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:53,658
I thought those
days were behind us.

217
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:57,203
Naw, man, our best days
are ahead of us, girl.

218
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:00,565
I need a good SIGN guy
who can provide me with

219
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,678
minute-by-minute intel
and some real time images.

220
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,974
These days
you're talking drones.

221
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:12,577
So what do you need me for?

222
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:16,756
I need you by my
side to watch my six

223
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,493
and do what you do best.

224
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:22,520
<i>His name's Matthew Sharp.</i>

225
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:23,754
<i>SIGN all the way,</i>

226
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:27,233
<i>but five years of HUMINT</i>
<i>training before that.</i>

227
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,361
<i>How long with the Agency?</i>

228
00:20:29,486 --> 00:20:31,763
<i>- Fifteen years.</i>
<i>- Before that?</i>

229
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,499
<i>Army, Special Forces.</i>

230
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:39,604
<i>Doesn't have much else</i>
<i>in his jacket about that.</i>

231
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,506
<i>Yeah, probably wouldn't.</i>

232
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:53,351
Am I meeting this guy?
He's late.

233
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:56,788
He picked the time
and the place.

234
00:20:56,913 --> 00:20:58,398
Yeah.

235
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,832
Uh, John, that thing's
coming in pretty low.

236
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,748
I think it's locked
on to your truck.

237
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,647
Shit, he's locked on to my car.

238
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:36,269
John.

239
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,865
- Let him go.
- But it's carrying an AR.

240
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,870
- John.
- Let him go.

241
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,625
Okay, that got my attention.

242
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,392
John.

243
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,440
John.

244
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:31,891
You must be Sharp?

245
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,393
You must be John Harmon.

246
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,120
Yeah, I'm Harmon,
but I'm still waiting

247
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:37,722
for the answer to my question.

248
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,565
Yeah, Matthew Sharp.

249
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,026
That's some pretty nice
piloting you did out there.

250
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,563
I might have a job for you.

251
00:22:52,937 --> 00:22:56,049
So Rivera's group has
moved into Puerto Rico

252
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,917
to try to grab the heroin trade.

253
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,911
Drugs come in to the states
through smuggling corridors

254
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:02,722
in Arizona, Texas,
and California.

255
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:03,982
They're shipped to New Mexico

256
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,750
then trucked to the
eastern seaboard.

257
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,820
At the FBI, we have a saying
that applies to Puerto Rico.

258
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:11,798
No customs, no problem.

259
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,358
See that's what it's about.

260
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:19,906
I mean they have a situation now where
it's kind of very distinct, you know.

261
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,868
'Cause US territory means that any
shipments departing the United States

262
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:26,546
are not
required to clear customs.

263
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,815
So shipping the drugs
to the eastern seaboard

264
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,175
from Puerto Rico
is easier than using

265
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,477
the established
smuggling cartel routes

266
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:35,121
and trucking the
stuff across country.

267
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,590
And now that Rivera's
controlling it,

268
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,684
he's trying to set
up a new situation.

269
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,820
He's trying to set
up a new supply.

270
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:45,565
And I think that's what
this meeting's about.

271
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,158
The company's well
aware of the ambitions

272
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:48,793
of Rivera and others like him.

273
00:23:48,918 --> 00:23:52,730
But until it leaves our borders
it's DEA and FBI territory.

274
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:57,777
Intel has really shown us
unequivocally and absolutely

275
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,004
that Rivera is joining forces

276
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:03,649
with the
Islamic fundamentalists.

277
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:07,178
And there's where
he'll get new supply,

278
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:09,489
new man power, new routes.

279
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,016
Al-Mujahid is gonna get
them all their quarters

280
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:15,561
which gives them new access...

281
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,789
...to bring anybody and anything

282
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:22,461
they want into the US,
and that's scary.

283
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:31,010
Istanbul.

284
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,770
If it's good
enough for the heroin trade,

285
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,415
it's good enough for Rivera.

286
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,484
We all know that
devout believers,

287
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,686
real believers of all faiths,

288
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:44,082
have nothing to do with the rise
in violence across the world,

289
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:47,927
but that doesn't mean that we
shouldn't do anything to stop it.

290
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,255
In my book, it makes it
our duty to stop it.

291
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,092
That's right. We don't give a fuck
about anybody's fucking religion.

292
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:58,296
We don't care about what their
ethnicity is, we don't care.

293
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:00,673
We let everybody
do what they want.

294
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,934
It's like the great
Genghis Khan once said,

295
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,112
"Practice your own religion,
but pay tax to me."

296
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:09,908
It's like a monkey trying
to fuck a football now, really.

297
00:25:10,033 --> 00:25:12,644
This whole thing,
it's just a fucking mess.

298
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:19,617
Anyway, my intel is
telling me right now that

299
00:25:19,742 --> 00:25:22,829
Rivera's supposedly
holding a summit.

300
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,766
Supposed to be a big meeting
within the next 48 hours.

301
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:31,037
It's my job to stop
that meeting from happening.

302
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,197
First, we need a car.

303
00:25:33,322 --> 00:25:34,922
Let's see.

304
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,902
Looks like I found
the perfect one.

305
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:40,680
<i>Rivera collects
vintage American cars.</i>

306
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,749
<i>How's a canary yellow</i>
<i>Camaro sound to you?</i>

307
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:46,811
It's a little small
but it'll stand out.

308
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,788
Sharp, you in position?

309
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,830
In position.

310
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,913
Rivera's pulling up now.

311
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,432
Is our other party close?

312
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,841
Not yet.

313
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:11,049
Good, I'm getting into position,
Zara's heading inside now.

314
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,874
Zara, you copy?

315
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:30,810
Go, Harmon.

316
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,837
<i>What's your 20?</i>

317
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,895
At the elevators,
eighth floor.

318
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,997
Stay put I'm coming
in the side door.

319
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:55,193
Sharp, I need you to look into
target room on the eighth floor.

320
00:29:55,318 --> 00:29:56,918
I'm on it.

321
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,016
Come on, where are you?

322
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,243
<i>Sharp?</i>

323
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:50,148
Still looking.

324
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,168
Who the fuck are you?

325
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,387
Sharp, you're killing me.

326
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,324
Gotcha.

327
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,119
Harmon, room 826.

328
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:06,257
Zara, get me clearance
on the other side.

329
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,227
Good afternoon, ma'am.
How can I help?

330
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:12,605
Could you connect me
to room 825?

331
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,666
Of course, ma'am. May I have
the name of your guest please?

332
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,601
- O'Sullivan.
- O'Sullivan.

333
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:22,147
- 825.
- 825, 825...

334
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,175
I'm very sorry ma'am
but this room is vacant.

335
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,311
Can I have the name
of your party again?

336
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,054
O'Sullivan.

337
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,215
Let me just check and make
sure I have the right room.

338
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,626
It will help,
thank you very much.

339
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,386
825.

340
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,289
<i>Vacant, it's all yours, Harmon.</i>

341
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,458
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Sharp are we covered?</i>

342
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,460
Like white on rice.

343
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,732
825.

344
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:21,265
<i>I got my eyes on you, Harmon.</i>
<i>All good.</i>

345
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,274
No answer, I'll have
to check back in a few.

346
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,610
- Sorry for the bother.
- No problem.

347
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:09,588
No, no.

348
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:13,785
My friend... just you and me.

349
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:18,063
You should go. It's enough.

350
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:19,431
I'll go with you.

351
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:21,459
You two watch the lobby
and you two make sure

352
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:25,396
that Mr. Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.

353
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,163
Let's go.

354
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:36,148
Harmon, you got company.
Sending you an image now.

355
00:34:36,273 --> 00:34:37,873
Alright, stand by.

356
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,779
<i>They are on their way up now.</i>

357
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:50,755
<i>It's enough.</i>
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

358
00:34:57,227 --> 00:35:00,297
Ayan Al-Mujahid.
Former number two man, Hezbollah,

359
00:35:00,422 --> 00:35:02,399
in charge of the bomb makers.

360
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:05,169
Fully assumed control back
in September

361
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:08,773
after the US drone strike
took out his brother.

362
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:14,278
His whereabouts is,
at the moment, unknown.

363
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,420
<i>Looks like we just found him.</i>
<i>Gate four.</i>

364
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,317
At last, no more middlemen.

365
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:49,321
I trust the plane
was satisfactory, right?

366
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:50,881
I see you already
met my assistants.

367
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:53,392
Belicio, Augustine.

368
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,852
Why are they here?

369
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:57,329
I told you,
they are my assistants.

370
00:35:57,454 --> 00:35:58,689
<i>They are nothing but killers.</i>

371
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:04,169
<i>Yes, and they happen to be
very good at what they do.</i>

372
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:05,894
<i>Do you have problem with that?</i>

373
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:18,476
Sure, no problem, hefe.

374
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,328
What the fuck is that?

375
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,802
What is what?

376
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:50,374
Is that a camera?

377
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:55,454
Ayan, we aren't in the desert.

378
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:00,425
<i>This is a five star hotel</i>
<i>on some of the most expensive</i>

379
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,520
<i>stretch of land in Istanbul.</i>

380
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,524
Something is not right here.

381
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,093
Ayan.

382
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:14,062
Ayan.

383
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,802
You don't think that I,
that I'm surveilling you

384
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:21,213
without your knowledge here?

385
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:25,809
I think you're acting maybe
a little paranoid, my friend.

386
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:30,581
Rivera, it's not paranoia
if they are really after you.

387
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:33,484
And I'm not your friend.

388
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:38,230
I am, however, used to
things not going to plan.

389
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:39,957
People dying because
of what I believe

390
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:42,501
needs to be done for my cause.

391
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,204
The merging of your
organization and ours

392
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,965
is beneficial to both
of us in many ways.

393
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,702
However, just because I need
your help, it doesn't mean

394
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:55,606
I don't think of you as
nothing more than an infidel

395
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,610
that I'd rather see dead
and buried in the sand.

396
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,517
This should cover
the plane you sent.

397
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:11,789
I'm heading back to the Palace Hotel
to check on the package.

398
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,059
The meeting will take place
as previously discussed.

399
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:18,570
At your compound
by the Rumeli Feneri.

400
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:22,666
If any other suspicious
events will occur between

401
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:27,946
now and then,
I can assure you of two things.

402
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:31,883
One, the meeting
will not take place.

403
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:36,513
And two, the last face
that you'll see before

404
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:41,752
you are buried in the sand
will be mine, smiling.

405
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,926
Mujahid is now on
his way to the lobby.

406
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:52,537
They bought it.
Nice flying, Sharp.

407
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:55,633
Time to get
the fuck out of here.

408
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,638
Just go down to the lobby
and make sure

409
00:39:01,763 --> 00:39:04,675
nothing suspicious
happens while you do.

410
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:12,650
Get someone out and ask who's
flying that fucking drone.

411
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:19,698
Zara, give me
coordinates on my secure site

412
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:23,435
and an accurate schematic,
if you can.

413
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,096
Soon as you log the
time for the meeting.

414
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:28,040
<i>Copy that.</i>

415
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,542
<i>Sharp, I'm gonna
beat Al-Mujahid.</i>

416
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,069
<i>Meet me back at the safe house.</i>

417
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,794
Copy that.

418
00:39:45,715 --> 00:39:48,452
What's Rivera's
Camaro doing here?

419
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,259
The drone.

420
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:01,229
There, come on.

421
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,544
Shit.

422
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,605
Harmon, I've been made.

423
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,586
I got two players
at the elevators.

424
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,489
There's a third
in the elevator with him.

425
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:19,784
Good to know
they're out numbered.

426
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:34,565
<i>He's heading to his car.</i>

427
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,641
Yeah, I know.

428
00:40:36,766 --> 00:40:38,636
It's his car, alright.

429
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,940
- I'm calling Rivera.
- Yeah, okay.

430
00:40:46,843 --> 00:40:48,979
Did you take this car?

431
00:41:29,185 --> 00:41:32,756
Looks like time for phase two.

432
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,352
Harmon, Rivera's on the move.

433
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:11,663
<i>Follow him.</i>

434
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:14,992
<i>But if he suspects you,
back off and then go.</i>

435
00:43:15,117 --> 00:43:18,329
We're just setting a hook,
not scaring him.

436
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,641
Copy that.

437
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,668
I'll keep peaking him
'til you do.

438
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:26,393
Then I'll get gone.

439
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,509
One hundred Euro.

440
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,758
There's one just like it
if you follow that black car.

441
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,219
And a third if you forget
you ever picked me up.

442
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:44,421
I don't know what
you're talking about.

443
00:43:44,546 --> 00:43:48,392
- I'm on my lunch break, so...
- That's what I like to hear.

444
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,808
Tell me, have any
of you noticed the tail?

445
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:07,609
Since the hotel.

446
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,849
Lose him, lose him now.

447
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,885
Game on.

448
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:30,233
<i>They finally picked me up.</i>

449
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:32,035
<i>How are you doing with Rivera?</i>

450
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,738
He hasn't spotted me yet.
We're heading east.

451
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:36,873
I'm thinking Zariyash district.

452
00:44:36,998 --> 00:44:38,016
<i>That's a good bet.</i>

453
00:44:38,141 --> 00:44:39,651
I'm gonna turn up
the heat a little bit.

454
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:42,012
You back off and meet me at
the safe house in 30 minutes.

455
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,246
Copy that, out.

456
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,057
Okay, lunch break's over.

457
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:49,260
New destination,
Zariyash district.

458
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:52,022
I'll tell you where to go
when we get closer.

459
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,858
Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

460
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:02,799
- The tail is turning around.
- In the cab?

461
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:04,809
Si.

462
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:06,837
Must be the Arabs.

463
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:15,320
I'm not sure what kind of game
Ayan is trying to play with me.

464
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:18,348
Put the Turkish team
from the hotel on the cab.

465
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,084
And no more fuck ups this time.
Understand?

466
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:22,986
- Claro.
- Good.

467
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,829
<i>Analyzing voice patterns.</i>

468
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:36,032
<i>It's not paranoia
if they are really after you.</i>

469
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:39,803
<i>Synthesizing voice for Al-Mujahid.</i>

470
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,215
- Ayan.
-<i>Rivera.</i>

471
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,419
I warned you about doing
anything suspicious, didn't I?

472
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,279
<i>Ayan, I don't have</i>
<i>the slightest idea</i>

473
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:50,547
what you're talking about

474
00:45:50,672 --> 00:45:53,951
and why you call me
on an unsecure line.

475
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:58,221
- Do you own a yellow Camaro?
- You know I do.

476
00:45:58,346 --> 00:46:02,400
Please tell me why it's
following me at this moment.

477
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:03,426
Who has my car?

478
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:05,136
- What?
- Who has my car?

479
00:46:05,261 --> 00:46:06,897
It's at the compound. Why?

480
00:46:07,022 --> 00:46:10,534
Because this guy
is telling me in this moment

481
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:13,069
that my car is following him.

482
00:46:13,194 --> 00:46:14,794
It's impossible.

483
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:31,863
Ayan, I have no idea who
is following you in my car.

484
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:34,165
<i>I warned you</i>
<i>that anymore bullshit</i>

485
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,959
and I call off the meeting.

486
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,795
Are you telling me?

487
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:40,628
Yeah, I swear.

488
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,839
Harmon, go.

489
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:16,466
<i>The safe house, boss.</i>

490
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:20,036
Good, Zara's right behind you.
I'll be there in 10.

491
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:21,938
<i>They take the bait?</i>

492
00:47:22,063 --> 00:47:23,663
What do you think?

493
00:48:13,723 --> 00:48:16,192
<i>Harmon, speak to me.</i>

494
00:48:16,317 --> 00:48:19,930
We're gonna need
to get rid of the car.

495
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,195
Harmon, go.

496
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,263
<i>It's Beck.</i>

497
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:48,158
Of all the people for
Rivera to be partnering with,

498
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:52,470
Ayan Al-Mujahid is one of
the most dangerous, Beck.

499
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,297
<i>That's why</i>
<i>he's CIA territory.</i>

500
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:56,174
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

501
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:57,576
And you would know?

502
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,437
<i>Yes, even though I'm</i>
<i>not CIA I think I would know.</i>

503
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:04,374
But there's another objective
because there usually is.

504
00:49:04,499 --> 00:49:07,243
<i>As I already told you,</i>
<i>I'm not CIA,</i>

505
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:08,712
<i>so I wouldn't know.</i>

506
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:12,115
And as I am also not
working for the Agency,

507
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,087
I'm just a reactivated asset,
maybe you could tell me why.

508
00:49:17,212 --> 00:49:18,329
<i>Why?</i>

509
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:21,099
Because we would be searching
all over Mexico

510
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,327
to find this location if it
wasn't for you and your team.

511
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:27,038
So why did you reactivate me?

512
00:49:27,163 --> 00:49:29,974
Because you
killed the bear, John.

513
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,634
<i>And now I need you</i>
<i>to kill someone else.</i>

514
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:36,180
Al-Mujahid and Jose Rivera
are gonna seal this fucking deal

515
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:39,617
tomorrow night unless I act
on this intel right away.

516
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:41,586
<i>What do you
have to say about that?</i>

517
00:49:41,711 --> 00:49:43,079
I've got a delta team en route

518
00:49:43,204 --> 00:49:44,989
to handle that
very problem for you.

519
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,751
<i>Like you said, Hawk,
we don't need you or your team</i>

520
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:50,929
<i>to end up being the villain</i>
<i>if this thing goes south.</i>

521
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,057
You did what you needed to do,
pinpoint and locate the meeting.

522
00:49:54,182 --> 00:49:58,461
<i>Now it's time to do</i>
<i>what you do best, alone.</i>

523
00:49:58,586 --> 00:50:02,674
You know if I
remember correctly, Beck,

524
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,109
you came to me hat in hand.

525
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:07,137
You begged me to help.

526
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:10,114
Look, I'm here,
off the books,

527
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,776
because I need to
reactivate a cold asset.

528
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:17,121
I had my reservations,
but I agreed.

529
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:21,351
All I asked was at the time
you be straight with me.

530
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:25,196
And somehow,
in the back of my mind,

531
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:28,324
I'm getting this strange
little voice telling me,

532
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:30,794
they're not being
straight with you.

533
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:33,438
And I don't think you are.

534
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,166
<i>And I was, John.
Just think about it.</i>

535
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,476
The money,
the resources, the team.

536
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,179
Now I'm tasking you
with another objective.

537
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,305
<i>Comes from the top.</i>

538
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,649
<i>You're the CIA's</i>
<i>best wet mechanic,</i>

539
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:46,376
<i>and you're already in country.</i>

540
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,344
That was no accident, okay.

541
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:50,447
Who is the target?

542
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:54,217
Is the real target Al-Mujahid?

543
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:54,993
<i>No.</i>

544
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,753
<i>Is the target in that room?</i>

545
00:50:56,878 --> 00:50:58,488
Yes.

546
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:02,859
Do you want
my team to stand down?

547
00:51:02,984 --> 00:51:04,584
<i>Yes.</i>

548
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:11,134
- So you want me to act alone.
<i>- Yes.</i>

549
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:16,481
- Who is the target?
- Abdul Rauf.

550
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,016
<i>You know the name, John.</i>

551
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,484
<i>The third
Crimea Airlines bomber.</i>

552
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,644
<i>The one who actually made the</i>
<i>bomb that took down the plane</i>

553
00:51:21,769 --> 00:51:25,415
<i>with 238 innocent</i>
<i>people on board.</i>

554
00:52:01,417 --> 00:52:04,420
<i>Welcome to Crimea flight A-450.</i>

555
00:52:04,545 --> 00:52:08,324
<i>Please step out of the aisle
while stowing the carry on baggage</i>

556
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:11,261
<i>allowing other</i>
<i>passengers to pass.</i>

557
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,980
<i>He's a bad one, John.</i>

558
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:06,190
<i>CIA trained.</i>

559
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:07,917
<i>He's about to activate
cells in the US.</i>

560
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,494
<i>He's the package.</i>

561
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,387
The one being
smuggled in by Rivera.

562
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:13,590
<i>This alliance</i>
<i>is all so Al-Mujahid</i>

563
00:53:13,715 --> 00:53:15,299
<i>can get Rauf into the US.</i>

564
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:17,335
<i>So have your team</i>
<i>pack up their gear.</i>

565
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,895
<i>I'll set up</i>
<i>an exit route for you</i>

566
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,372
<i>on USS Mount Whitney</i>
<i>in three hours.</i>

567
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:22,498
Their mission is over.

568
00:53:22,623 --> 00:53:24,434
<i>Get it done John and come home.</i>

569
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,477
So that's it?

570
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,670
Well, as far as he's concerned,
for you two, that's it.

571
00:53:27,795 --> 00:53:30,781
As far as I'm concerned,
it's not it.

572
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:33,376
You don't think I had anything
to do with this, do you?

573
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,444
I don't know, man.

574
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:38,289
I think that if you're
asking me if you had anything

575
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:40,917
to do with Beck
pulling us from the job

576
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:44,254
one minute after he
received enough information

577
00:53:44,379 --> 00:53:48,625
to pass it on up the food chain,
I would say no.

578
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,403
Okay, thanks.

579
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,714
That was my office,
there's nothing I can do.

580
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,857
Beck really thinks it's
a good idea to pull us out

581
00:54:20,982 --> 00:54:22,458
before we finish the job?

582
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:26,029
He does have
other operational plans.

583
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,766
You're staying on.

584
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,491
I am.

585
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:33,736
You have a new objective.

586
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:36,506
I'm not gonna listen
to any of his shit.

587
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:39,517
I'll make him think I am,
but I'm not.

588
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:42,520
We're gonna stay on
and we will kick ass together.

589
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:44,747
Nothing's gonna change,
we'll finish what we started.

590
00:54:44,872 --> 00:54:46,749
- You hear?
- And how do we do that?

591
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:50,453
Like this.
You're gonna love this.

592
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,401
What are you guys cooking up?

593
00:54:57,526 --> 00:55:00,697
See, we already have
all the leg work done.

594
00:55:00,822 --> 00:55:04,100
We've got the location,
the time of the meet,

595
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:05,509
and the players.

596
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:08,638
And that's really
all Beck cares about.

597
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,350
What we also did was
create a situation where

598
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,811
we've pitted these guys
against each other.

599
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,522
They suspect each other,
that's gonna fuck up the meeting,

600
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:21,351
and pretty soon they're
gonna wanna kill each other.

601
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:22,326
Cy ops.

602
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:23,753
Well, that's kinda how we do.

603
00:55:23,878 --> 00:55:25,521
<i>Anyway, we've just succeeded</i>

604
00:55:25,646 --> 00:55:27,857
<i>in burning these bitches</i>
<i>to the ground,</i>

605
00:55:27,982 --> 00:55:30,927
<i>'cause Rivera can't figure out
why his Arab partners</i>

606
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:35,898
<i>decided to wage a secret war
against him at this critical junction.</i>

607
00:55:36,023 --> 00:55:39,936
<i>He doesn't know
that they haven't, and we have.</i>

608
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:48,019
So you're altering
his official file.

609
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,113
Beck's gonna know
that's been dummied up.

610
00:55:50,238 --> 00:55:52,048
It's not for Beck.

611
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:56,594
<i>This is for Rivera.</i>

612
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,657
<i>So you're setting up</i>
<i>Al-Mujahid with Rivera.</i>

613
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:04,769
What about the other way around?

614
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,430
<i>Al-Mujahid's the
mastermind behind all of this.</i>

615
00:56:07,555 --> 00:56:10,074
<i>Without his desire for</i>
<i>this meeting to take place,</i>

616
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:12,635
<i>Rivera would be content
running the drug trade.</i>

617
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,580
There's no doubt that Al-Mujahid knows
the value of this access into the US.

618
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:18,741
So much so that he's
willing to put up with all

619
00:56:18,866 --> 00:56:21,352
the perceived indignities
to make it happen.

620
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:24,147
And his threat to pull out
is just that, threats.

621
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:27,358
Because he has resident
cells placed inside the US,

622
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:29,452
what does he need
to activate them?

623
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:31,754
Transient cells,
someone smuggled in.

624
00:56:31,879 --> 00:56:36,593
He'd give anything for that.
And for that, he needs Rivera.

625
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,038
Rivera's compound.

626
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:45,009
Anyway, the location of the
meeting's in 24 hours, guys.

627
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:47,837
This is the alarm system
command and control.

628
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:56,746
Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.

629
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:04,562
<i>Rivera 1-4-6-9-2-5 override.</i>

630
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,097
What'd you just do?

631
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,157
Shut off the alarm system.

632
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:10,593
How does that affect Al-Mujahid?

633
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,751
Who turned off the alarm,
and why?

634
00:57:57,806 --> 00:58:01,652
Ayan. It's become
all too regular for you

635
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,212
to be calling me like this.

636
00:58:03,337 --> 00:58:05,781
What the fuck
are you talking about?

637
00:58:05,906 --> 00:58:11,095
Do you know that you threatened
to march, you piece of shit.

638
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,789
Or maybe I just
call your bluff, hmm.

639
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:17,435
I'm a businessman,
I do business.

640
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,929
You said that you want
to call off the meeting.

641
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:23,641
<i>Fine, call the meeting, fine.</i>

642
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,302
<i>But my humor has a limit.</i>

643
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:30,514
<i>And then I become</i>
<i>a real asshole.</i>

644
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,175
And when I'm a real asshole,

645
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,847
I sometimes forget about
my business agreements.

646
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,657
Understand me?

647
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,718
<i>You mean to tell me
that you have had nothing to do</i>

648
00:58:42,843 --> 00:58:44,253
<i>with the drone surveillance?</i>

649
00:58:44,378 --> 00:58:46,756
What the fuck is that?

650
00:58:52,828 --> 00:58:56,240
- What is what?
- Is that a camera?

651
00:58:56,365 --> 00:59:00,103
The attempt on my life
in your flashy yellow car?

652
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,908
And now the very suspicious
disarming of your alarm system

653
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:09,812
right before our meeting
at your compound.

654
00:59:13,015 --> 00:59:18,621
Do not think for one moment
that I don't know my value for the CIA.

655
00:59:20,155 --> 00:59:24,093
You forget my only reason
for making this agreement.

656
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:25,818
Rauf.

657
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,765
Must be that all your
good humor is used up.

658
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,842
<i>Is that it?</i>

659
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,803
<i>So being the businessman</i>
<i>that you are,</i>

660
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:35,838
do not think that
I'm foolish enough

661
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:39,342
not to see a double cross
when one present itself.

662
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:44,847
You are more paranoid
than Pablo Escobar ever was.

663
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:50,787
<i>I suggest you rethink your</i>
<i>priorities and call me back.</i>

664
00:59:51,887 --> 00:59:56,600
I will give you 30 minutes.

665
00:59:56,725 --> 01:00:02,239
Ayan, please believe
this 30 minutes

666
01:00:02,364 --> 01:00:09,872
are the most important 30 minutes
of your entire existence.

667
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:29,600
You know,
this could get back to us.

668
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:31,335
In my opinion if this works,

669
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,271
they're gonna pat us on the
back and take all the credit.

670
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:35,865
If it doesn't, they'll swoop in

671
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,733
with the D-boys
and kill everybody.

672
01:00:37,858 --> 01:00:41,078
Either way we will have
finished the job we started.

673
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:42,713
I'm gonna pack up my gear,

674
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:45,875
and I'll meet you at the
extraction point in two hours.

675
01:01:26,915 --> 01:01:30,094
It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

676
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,721
I mean, you're the one
looking like that.

677
01:01:31,846 --> 01:01:34,357
It's been awhile since
I've seen you like that.

678
01:03:02,544 --> 01:03:04,981
I thought I closed those.

679
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,654
John?

680
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:46,856
Get the other one.

681
01:05:17,245 --> 01:05:19,489
How long?

682
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:23,085
- Forty-five minutes.
- Rivera or Al-Mujahid?

683
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,330
- Rivera.
- So she's in the compound.

684
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:27,431
What's the play?

685
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,591
I'm going to get
my partner back.

686
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:31,316
I'll get the van.

687
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:04,293
Sure like doing
business with you, ma'am.

688
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,266
She's awake.

689
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:22,843
No, she's not.

690
01:06:27,682 --> 01:06:29,451
Zara's cell phone.

691
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:32,162
What? You sure?

692
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:36,258
<i>...Rauf makes it back to the
Palace Hotel without incident, okay.</i>

693
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,684
Come on, get in,
I'll fill you in on the drive.

694
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:24,214
- I missed it.
- Missed what?

695
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:27,217
It was right under my
nose and I missed it.

696
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,444
I'm not following you.

697
01:07:28,569 --> 01:07:30,420
This entire
meeting was a set up.

698
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:33,615
And it was a set up to get us
looking in the wrong direction.

699
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,319
Beck tasked us with putting
together a team to locate

700
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:42,399
and disrupt a meeting between
Daish and the cartels.

701
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:45,327
But mysteriously they
won't let us finish it.

702
01:07:45,452 --> 01:07:47,052
Why?

703
01:07:48,363 --> 01:07:50,800
Because he's a paid
and bought bureaucrat?

704
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:55,304
Because he thought
the real target would be there.

705
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,375
Take a look at this.

706
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:01,385
<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

707
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,479
<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

708
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:06,749
<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

709
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:14,456
- I know that name.
- Yeah, we all do.

710
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:18,201
<i>Abdul Rauf was
trained by the Agency.</i>

711
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:20,729
<i>But that was before he
and his buddies blew up</i>

712
01:08:20,854 --> 01:08:24,733
the commercial airliner
that killed about 238 people.

713
01:08:24,858 --> 01:08:28,704
In Mujahid's file he was
in charge of the bomb makers

714
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:32,082
before his brother
was killed and he took over

715
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:34,284
the command and control, so...

716
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:36,311
If he's carrying a
suitcase nuke or a dirty bomb

717
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:39,089
he could decimate
a US city in seconds.

718
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:41,817
See, Beck wants me to take
him out before he gets there,

719
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:44,227
but his intel is bad.

720
01:08:44,352 --> 01:08:47,556
He's sending in the D-boys
to the wrong location,

721
01:08:47,681 --> 01:08:49,699
which means
we have no more time.

722
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:52,528
It means you and I are gonna
have to get there and do this.

723
01:08:52,653 --> 01:08:54,663
Alright.
So where are we headed?

724
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:57,741
<i>I'll go with him.</i>
<i>You two watch the lobby.</i>

725
01:08:57,866 --> 01:08:59,768
<i>And you make sure that
Mr. Rauf makes it back</i>

726
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:02,671
<i>to the Palace Hotel
without incident, okay.</i>

727
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:04,640
Palace Hotel.

728
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:49,226
Ayan, what the fuck?
Where is Rauf?

729
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,462
I was about you to ask
you the same thing Rivera.

730
01:09:52,587 --> 01:09:55,191
Is this how you Mexicans
do all your deals?

731
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:09,738
What the fuck is this?

732
01:10:09,863 --> 01:10:13,183
If my understanding
of English is any good,

733
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:16,612
I will say that the man
pictured where your picture

734
01:10:16,737 --> 01:10:21,350
is supposed to be, doesn't
look a thing like Ayan Mujahid.

735
01:10:21,475 --> 01:10:23,760
And to add insult to injury,

736
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:27,289
it says there
that you're supposed to be dead.

737
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:31,501
So, again, where is Rauf?

738
01:10:31,626 --> 01:10:35,338
- I see what is going on here.
- You see?

739
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:39,868
Please, enlighten me because
what I thought is gonna be on

740
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:43,446
was a meeting
to seal our alliances.

741
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:47,443
- To create few rules.
- We have a saying.

742
01:10:48,476 --> 01:10:49,519
Please.

743
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:52,556
The man who speaks,
does not plan.

744
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:55,592
The man who plans,
does not speak.

745
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:58,754
It means I don't think
you are behind this.

746
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,964
It looks like CIA to me.

747
01:11:01,089 --> 01:11:04,526
And this is supposed
to make me feel better. How?

748
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:09,531
You aren't smart enough
to be working for the CIA.

749
01:11:11,599 --> 01:11:15,512
For the last time,
where is Rauf?

750
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:19,642
We have been compromised,
our business is finished.

751
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:22,275
Ayan.

752
01:11:29,017 --> 01:11:31,487
I want to show you something.

753
01:11:34,522 --> 01:11:37,426
We're here to smuggle Mr. Rauf
into the United States, no?

754
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:39,595
So time to make the deal.

755
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,609
Is this a joke?

756
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:49,571
You're right, there seems to be
a third party in our midst.

757
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:25,507
Harmon, eyes are up.
What's your 20?

758
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:32,114
Entering now.

759
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:57,580
<i>We're moving out
now. Begin sweeping the grounds</i>

760
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:59,141
<i>and meet us
in the conference room.</i>

761
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:00,866
Copy that.

762
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:07,683
Who the fuck are you?

763
01:13:54,028 --> 01:13:57,466
<i>Gotcha.</i>
<i>Third floor. Wait.</i>

764
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,806
<i>They're moving Rauf out now.</i>

765
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:08,644
<i>Land your bird
and get in here and back me up.</i>

766
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:10,946
Going upstairs.

767
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,748
Copy that.

768
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,834
Hey, wait.

769
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:34,559
Who are you?

770
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:22,751
It looks like someone decided
to cancel our arrangement.

771
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:26,763
What do you mean? Her?

772
01:15:26,888 --> 01:15:29,724
- She's just a fucking woman.
- Enough.

773
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:34,229
Benicio, untie her and give
her something to drink.

774
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:39,167
We'll see if she's
more than just a woman.

775
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,811
Boss, come with me, now.

776
01:15:49,936 --> 01:15:51,780
Rivera!

777
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,833
<i>...moving in.</i>

778
01:16:16,337 --> 01:16:19,741
Come on, boss, we have
to get you out of here.

779
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:28,858
- Let's go.
- I want Rauf.

780
01:16:28,983 --> 01:16:31,019
If I have Rauf,
I have all the leverage

781
01:16:31,144 --> 01:16:32,754
to get out of this mess.

782
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,140
Uh-uh, come on.

783
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:14,229
<i>Copy that.
Team two closing the perimeter.</i>

784
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:18,498
Come on.

785
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:05,047
Compound is clear.
No sign of Rivera.

786
01:18:10,017 --> 01:18:11,961
Copy. You hear that, Harmon?

787
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:16,024
D-boys are clearing the compound.
No sign of Rivera or Zara.

788
01:20:04,265 --> 01:20:08,010
Yeah, Sharp,
I've located the target.

789
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:11,006
<i>Ground floor conference room,</i>
<i>near the back.</i>

790
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:18,421
Two guards posted.
Two guards.

791
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,114
<i>I've located</i>
<i>the main power box.</i>

792
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,182
<i>On my count.</i>

793
01:20:21,307 --> 01:20:24,093
Three, two, one.

794
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:51,012
<i>Rivera got through,</i>
<i>repeat Rivera on the run.</i>

795
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,884
Mr. Rauf.

796
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:19,007
Do you know why I'm here?

797
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:21,676
Do you know why you're here?

798
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:25,021
I'm here because
the CIA hates it

799
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,290
when they train somebody

800
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:31,928
who takes what they've given
them and makes a lot of money

801
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:35,198
to finance
terrorist activities.

802
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,658
Is that what they told you?

803
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:40,169
Yeah, they told me that
and I read a few reports.

804
01:21:40,294 --> 01:21:43,331
But what if I told you that
I was ordered to do what I did?

805
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:46,534
That I know all about
the CIA's deep dark secrets

806
01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:50,271
from Tripoli to Syria
and everything in between.

807
01:21:50,396 --> 01:21:51,981
You know too much.

808
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:53,508
I'd say that's
why I'm a target.

809
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:56,177
I commend you for
telling the truth.

810
01:21:56,302 --> 01:22:01,650
I just can't let you come into America
and activate these cells.

811
01:22:05,286 --> 01:22:09,624
You actually think that this is
a war of religious differences?

812
01:22:09,749 --> 01:22:13,261
It's much bigger than
differences in ideologies.

813
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:18,140
I got it. I understand warriors
fighting for their cause,

814
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:21,177
for their countries,
for their religion,

815
01:22:21,302 --> 01:22:23,705
whatever they believe in,
their ideology.

816
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:28,610
But I draw the line when it comes to
killing innocent women and children.

817
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,295
This is where we really, really

818
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,223
have a big
difference of opinion.

819
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,193
Okay.

820
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,613
Rivera got through,
he's got Zara.

821
01:23:05,738 --> 01:23:07,716
Then he's coming here.

822
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:27,802
You go that way.

823
01:23:27,927 --> 01:23:30,572
Come with me. Move.

824
01:26:08,495 --> 01:26:10,139
Fuck you, puta.

825
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:31,653
Let's go home.

826
01:26:42,429 --> 01:26:44,499
We're done here, Sharp.

827
01:27:01,615 --> 01:27:05,761
<i>The paradigm has changed,</i>
<i>not shifted.</i>

828
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,755
<i>What we do</i>
<i>is protect the people</i>

829
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,367
<i>of the United States</i>
<i>of America.</i>

830
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,603
<i>And the American people</i>
<i>and all the elected officials</i>

831
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:16,931
<i>don't need to know</i>
<i>what we do, how we do it,</i>

832
01:27:17,056 --> 01:27:18,774
<i>or who we do it to.</i>

833
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:22,837
<i>All they need to know is</i>
<i>when they go to bed at night</i>

834
01:27:22,962 --> 01:27:28,843
<i>and turn out the lights,</i>
<i>that they're safe.</i>

835
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:03,944
<i>First we need a car.</i>
