00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,985
[up-tempo song plays

2
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,169
[girl] i've heard it said
that this here...

3
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:46,043
...this here's a man's world.

4
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:50,315
And some girls, they believe it.

5
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,146
Primping and fussing and holding out,

6
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:58,125
hoping a boy will look her way.

7
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,931
They don't know they got the power.

8
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:12,366
- [girl] As or me...
- [moans from inside car]

9
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,537
...I'm not that kind o girl.

10
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,704
I'm on top.

11
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:19,509
Which begs the question...

12
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:24,676
...I the girl's on top, well...

13
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,324
...who's the one getting screwed?

14
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:35,624
Hey, wait up!

15
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:39,999
So I it's a man's world,
God wouldn't have made me.

16
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,103
- Or that at fuck.
- [grunting]

17
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:49,036
[bell ringing]

18
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:59,511
OK, who can give me
an example of a good choice?

19
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:02,120
- Tonya?
- Waiting.

20
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,955
I mean, if a guy
really likes you, he'll wait.

21
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:10,089
And if he doesn't understand,
well, you know... so what?

22
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:14,670
Most excellent.
But hey, I know how it is.

23
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:17,739
- I was young, too.
- [class chuckling]

24
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:21,241
- Our hormones can get the best of us.
- Hey, pass it down.

25
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:24,472
The only safe sex is no sex.

26
00:02:24,614 --> 00:02:27,947
Unless you stay busy,
get some hobbies,

27
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:32,180
and practice abstinence,
you could end up asking,

28
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:35,780
"Was the momentary thrill
really worth it?"

29
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:38,326
What are some healthy alternatives?

30
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,362
- Tonya?
- You could have a pizza party.

31
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:44,831
[teacher] Right on.
Who doesn't love pizza?

32
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:47,027
- [all laughing]
- Anyone else?

33
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:51,740
What are your thoughts
on the pull-out method?

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,107
You must like the time
we spend together.

35
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,511
It's a real hoot.

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,016
Your classmates are
impressionable, Miss Edmonston.

37
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,678
Your ears might be
used to that kind of talk,

38
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,915
but most of these kids
come from good families.

39
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,959
You have any positive
males in your life?

40
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,754
A pastor or a neighbor or an uncle...

41
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,626
It's none of your business.

42
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,824
You're an exasperating girl,
Miss Edmonston.

43
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:20,630
According to Mr. Potter,
you spoke quite explicitly

44
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,465
about male projectile.

45
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:25,802
- It's a sex education class.
- Lifestyle choices.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,677
I'm putting you in Challengers.

47
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:34,375
- Special Ed?
- Challengers.

48
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:37,748
- That's for retards.
- It's either that or expulsion.

49
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,980
Miss Pierce will give you
your new schedule.

50
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:42,819
What is there to know? It's one room
in the basement, all the time.

51
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,793
Danielle, you're a smart girl.
You just make bad choices.

52
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,922
If you'll do your homework,
and stop being a distraction to others,

53
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,694
you'll be back with
the normal kids in no time.

54
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,303
Danielle...

55
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,302
...nobody likes a dirty girl.

56
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,571
Hello, Challengers!

57
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:02,803
[unenthusiastic] Hey.

58
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,380
Today we are going to start a project

59
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:09,781
that will hopefully teach us
that parenthood is no joke.

60
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,911
Right, Sabrina? Yeah.

61
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,286
Nobody's laughing at her house.

62
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:18,792
OK, everyone partner up
with someone of the opposite sex.

63
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:23,389
Two by two, like in the ark.

64
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,263
Who does not have a partner?

65
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:30,237
OK, Benita, why don't you
come over here near Joaquin?

66
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:34,742
And Clarke? We'll think of something.

67
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,008
[rock music playing on headphones]

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,542
OK, class?

69
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:45,813
This is Danielle Edmon... Edmonston.

70
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:50,654
And she will be joining us today,
so everyone say a big hello.

71
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:52,659
[murmuring] Hey.

72
00:04:52,796 --> 00:04:54,923
OK, Danielle. We're partnering up,

73
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:57,761
so why don't you just head right
on back there with Clarke.

74
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,309
For the next six weeks,
you will be married to your partner

75
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,745
in every sense but the biblical one.

76
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,077
- [music from headphones stops]
- You're that fag, right?

77
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:20,053
And these precious sacks
of flour will be your bundles of joy.

78
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,987
These are your daily journals.

79
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,787
You will record baby's first steps,

80
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:30,423
things that baby does that
are so cute you can't stand it.

81
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,867
OK, here is Mrs. Stork, making
a special delivery to you.

82
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,535
Who needs a baby?

83
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:42,236
- Takes after you.
- This is going to be so much fun.

84
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:44,278
[bell ringing]

85
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:45,904
[up-tempo song plays]

86
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:49,780
- What do you want?
- Uh, we're partners.

87
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,719
No offense, but my designated is, as
of this morning, no longer designated.

88
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:55,950
I don't know what that means.

89
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:59,220
It's Danielle's three D's of dating:
discriminate, designate, and dump,

90
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,989
and since the unfortunate
dumping of Brad,

91
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:03,998
due to his lack of sanitary
respect, I'm on to the next.

92
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:08,628
And quite frankly, as a dick smoker,
you don't qualify.

93
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:11,205
But we're married.

94
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,442
Discriminate.

95
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,842
Miss Hatcher says
we need to be good parents.

96
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,517
Designate.

97
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,495
Hey.

98
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,028
You got a light?

99
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,401
Hey, fellas.

100
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:52,181
- You're that girl, ain't you?
- Yep, I'm that girl.

101
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,250
You know what I heard about you?

102
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:59,512
Don't believe everything you hear.
Unless it's really good.

103
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:02,521
Then it's true.

104
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:05,992
Well, I hear you're
with the retards now.

105
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,960
[boys laughing]

106
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,561
[coughing]

107
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,797
[slow-tempo song plays]

108
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,684
[whispering indistinctly]

109
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:50,099
Your principal called today.

110
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,606
I am very disappointed in you.

111
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,580
[man] Now, just say
whatever comes to mind.

112
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:08,846
- Some pretty racy stuff, huh?
- Hm.

113
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,482
Want to know what I think?

114
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:13,289
I think those pictures scare you.

115
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,526
You know, Clarke, sexual feelings
aren't something to be afraid of.

116
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,201
What's your favorite kind of breast?

117
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,838
Long ones?

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,499
Pointy ones?

119
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,669
How do you like 'em, Clarke?

120
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:35,541
Hairy.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,078
Hairy.

122
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,424
[mouthing silently to slow-tempo song]

123
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,573
- Clarke!
- [music clicks off]

124
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:04,236
Stop it! Let's go.

125
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:13,989
[man] Roger me this, Son.
You and I had a deal, didn't we?

126
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,489
Seems to me you're not holding up
your end of the bargain, though,

127
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,184
you copy me?

128
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,924
Clarke? Do you copy me?

129
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:28,033
You know what that makes you?
It makes you a welcher.

130
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,163
The only thing worse than
being a gay is being a welcher.

131
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:35,472
- I'm not no gay.
- Yeah, who am I supposed to believe?

132
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,248
A 15-year-old welcher,
or a qualified medical physician?

133
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,748
- He's a chiropractor.
- He's got experience.

134
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,384
What the hell did you do in there?

135
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,215
You think this is funny,
you little shit?

136
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,553
- Wheel!
- God, don't do that!

137
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,684
Don't yell at somebody
that's lost control of the car.

138
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:56,489
You're a hair's breath from getting
your ass sent away for good.

139
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,624
That military academy
is starting to look like

140
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:01,202
a real sweet option to me
and your mother about now.

141
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:08,476
In her spare time, Maggie enjoys
long walks by the creek,

142
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:14,049
and stopping for sodas
at Sonic and shopping.

143
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:19,886
[Hatcher] Great work,
guys, really terrific.

144
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,990
OK, Clarke and Danielle, you're up.

145
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:32,228
Who do you think you are?
I mean, really.

146
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,495
You didn't even give her an outfit.

147
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,798
And for everyone else,
I appreciate your effort,

148
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,344
and your time that you put
into realizing your children.

149
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,414
Because, that one
would be dead on the street

150
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:49,950
or laying under a car somewhere,
with a needle in her arm.

151
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,020
[up-tempo song plays]

152
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:57,719
Hey, Mike!

153
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,420
Mike, get in the car.

154
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:02,520
Let's go!

155
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,000
Get in.

156
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:16,074
- Me?
- We got homework.

157
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,850
[Danielle] Don't worry
about being nice to my mom.

158
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:27,979
She's a total poon.

159
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,319
Danielle? ls that you?

160
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,827
This is Clarke. He's from school.

161
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:37,296
Sue-Ann. I'm Danielle's mom,
but you wouldn't know it to look at me.

162
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,333
That's a totally gross thing to say.

163
00:11:39,469 --> 00:11:43,667
But people think we're
sisters all the time. Cookie?

164
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,331
Nobody wants one of your
sad instant cookies, Sue-Ann.

165
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:50,776
- You said you liked these.
- I said I liked the dough.

166
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:56,946
Thanks.

167
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:04,788
She's nice.

168
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:06,656
She was a total slut
when she was in high school.

169
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:09,731
Now she's with this Mormon guy,
and she thinks she's Suzy Homemaker.

170
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:12,494
Danielle, we talked about this.

171
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:15,832
You can have boys over,
but this door stays open.

172
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:19,135
We're doing homework.
Besides, Clarke here's a fag.

173
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:25,410
Ray's bringing the kids
over for dinner later.

174
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,345
Y'all think you're
gonna be done by then?

175
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:30,884
If you close the goddamn door and
leave us alone and let us concentrate.

176
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:41,424
If I talked to my mom that way,
my dad would kick the shit out of me.

177
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,690
I don't have a dad.

178
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,827
- So I do what I want.
- [slow-tempo song plays]

179
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,763
[Danielle] Boy or girl?

180
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,933
I think I'd ruin a boy.

181
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:56,169
Girl. Name?

182
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,975
Uh... I don't know.

183
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:03,881
How about Joan? Like Joan Jett.

184
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,750
Or Crawford. That's nice.

185
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:09,318
Is there some sort of special gene

186
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,551
that makes you say "Crawford"
when I say "Joan"?

187
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,050
Huh?

188
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:15,322
It just seems the more times
a person gets poked in the butt,

189
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:17,432
the more likely they
are to say stupid faggy shit.

190
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:24,766
I'm a virgin.

191
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,409
It's not a big deal.

192
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:34,610
Tell it to my dad.

193
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:38,080
He'd be happier if I didn't exist.

194
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:40,954
That's not true.

195
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:45,326
I'm sure my dad loves me,
and I don't even know him.

196
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,024
That don't make no sense.

197
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,357
You know, if you're not careful,
you're gonna end up one of them

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,833
overweight homos with nobody
to love you but a gerbil named Bruce.

199
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,865
- You ready for me, baby?
- [up-tempo song plays]

200
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,406
Here I come.

201
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,816
Daddy's cleaning you all up.

202
00:14:13,623 --> 00:14:14,954
Yes!

203
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:21,452
- [Danielle] Is that your dad?
- [Clarke] Unfortunately.

204
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:26,627
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had homework.

205
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,360
[Danielle] Hey!

206
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,800
You forgot this.

207
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,845
You ruin me for anybody else.

208
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,758
Hey.

209
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,761
Hey.

210
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,068
Shit.

211
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:06,166
[up-tempo song plays]

212
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,711
[man] Peggy, what are you doing?

213
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,189
[laughter]

214
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,059
Are you crazy? That dog would kill you.

215
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,291
[all chuckling]

216
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,492
- Oh, hi!
- There she is!

217
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,967
We saved you some. It's on the stove.

218
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:14,006
Your mother and I would like
to speak with you about something.

219
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,241
Where's Mindy?

220
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,642
Get out of my room!

221
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:22,307
- You can be Heather.
- [Danielle] This is bullshit.

222
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,578
I mean, you can marry
this Mormon loser if you like,

223
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,486
but there is no way I'm sharing
my room with this little twat!

224
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:30,785
All right now, that's
going to be rule number one.

225
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:33,087
Anyone caught swearing
under this roof

226
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,856
is going to get their
mouth washed out with soap.

227
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:37,522
- Fuck you!
- Danielle.

228
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,793
- Don't test me.
- What's a twat?

229
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,529
You see? Now that's
what I'm talking about.

230
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:45,003
Evil has a unique way of spiraling.

231
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:48,633
A twat is an ugly,
flatulent, hairless vagina!

232
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,680
- I'm not going to warn you again.
- OK now, Ray, Danielle.

233
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,984
Have you ever heard of
the celestial kingdom, Danielle?

234
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,053
That's a magical place in the sky
where we'll live for all eternity.

235
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:06,320
- That's very good, honey.
- So?

236
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,954
Well, we want you
there with us, Danielle.

237
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,430
What are you talking about?

238
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,695
After your mother and I are
married, I'm going to adopt you.

239
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:17,635
- The hell you are!
- The hell I'm not.

240
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,003
It's the only way for you to get in.

241
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:22,201
We don't want you cast into...

242
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,402
...the outer darkness.

243
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,844
How's that different from any other day?

244
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:29,382
Think about it, Danielle.
You've always wanted a daddy.

245
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,316
- I have a daddy.
- A real daddy.

246
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:36,080
You know what? I'm going to take
this family on a retreat this weekend.

247
00:17:36,225 --> 00:17:40,025
- [Sue-Ann] Oh, wow! That's great!
- A little fishing, a little hot cocoa.

248
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,221
- Help you get used to the idea.
- You love cocoa.

249
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:45,663
I'm not going anywhere. Me and Clarke
are going to work on our project.

250
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,132
Well, family first.

251
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,703
Tough love time, Danielle.
You don't want us,

252
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,170
- we don't want you either.
- Ray!

253
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,207
- You can stay.
- Thank you.

254
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,742
But we're taking all
the food out of the kitchen.

255
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:57,869
- All the money out of your pockets.
- Fine.

256
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:59,947
- And the keys to your car.
- What?

257
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,413
- No! No!
- Then you will know

258
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,610
what it means to be alone
and stranded for all eternity!

259
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:08,450
- Ray, not a good idea.
- Well now, dadgum it, Sue-Ann.

260
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:09,922
You want me to be
the man of the house,

261
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,651
you gotta let me
make the tough decisions.

262
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,819
I believe, after this weekend,

263
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:16,727
Danielle will see the wisdom
and let me be her daddy.

264
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:21,269
Yeah? Does that mean
this guy will be my brother?

265
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:24,065
Well, is that a problem?

266
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,106
Yeah, considering I fucked him.

267
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:27,903
[up-tempo song plays]

268
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,910
- Mindy, go to your room.
- Don't you...!

269
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:34,973
- Hey, you fucking cow!
- Girl fight!

270
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,744
- [indistinct yelling]
- I hate you!

271
00:18:36,886 --> 00:18:38,376
- No!
- [groaning]

272
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,887
Calm down!
I am bigger, and I will win.

273
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:43,889
- Let go of me!
- [groaning]

274
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,653
You are not my dad!

275
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,442
Could you leave me alone? Please?

276
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:11,746
Ray's a good man.

277
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,318
He could be a good father.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,828
You can try to make me a Mormon,
but you're still a shitty mother.

279
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,733
[whispers] Good guys don't come
around that often, Danielle.

280
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:33,138
I'd like to keep this one.

281
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,539
He's not even cute.

282
00:19:48,524 --> 00:19:49,786
[sniffling]

283
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,660
We could have
a good family going here.

284
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:02,695
I don't want your stupid fake family.

285
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:07,502
OK.

286
00:20:15,384 --> 00:20:17,409
We'll see how you do on your own.

287
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,126
[door closes]

288
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,303
Meet Joan.

289
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,001
So named for the irrepressible
lead singer of the Blackhearts.

290
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:44,669
And the alcoholic,
child-abusing movie star.

291
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:46,110
[bell ringing]

292
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,681
Hey, wait up.

293
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,250
Don't fuck with me. I haven't
eaten in, like, 13 hours.

294
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:51,546
Why not?

295
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,178
Sue-Ann thinks she can
starve me into being a Mormon.

296
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:57,292
- That sucks.
- I'm having a really shitty day.

297
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,758
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to be left alone.

298
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:01,795
My dad said that I can
take you out tonight, his treat.

299
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,263
I have discriminated,
and designated. And I designate you.

300
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:09,034
Just... Please, just go away.

301
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:12,902
He gave me his credit card
if you want to go eat, or something.

302
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,880
Screw this.
I need a fork, you want one?

303
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:29,253
Chinese men must be good
with their fingers, I swear.

304
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:31,655
I hear they have straight pubic hair.

305
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,855
I tired to get a look at Shani Suzuki's
once in the locker room.

306
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,933
She's real careful with
her towel, so I never saw shit.

307
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,093
[slow-tempo song plays]

308
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,304
- Why are the lights off?
- Uh, fluorescent bulbs hurt my eyes.

309
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:49,809
Sue-Ann's so cheap.
You'd think at her age

310
00:21:49,945 --> 00:21:51,742
she'd want to give her face
the benefit of the doubt.

311
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
But it saves money, so I guess
she doesn't mind being green.

312
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,080
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

313
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:01,746
You're hitting on me,
and I do not appreciate it.

314
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,348
I have discriminated,
and I have designated.

315
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,483
Ahh!

316
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:07,652
- [grunts]
- [music halts]

317
00:22:07,796 --> 00:22:09,457
What the fuck?
I thought you were a faggot.

318
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:11,691
- Only 65 percent.
- Huh?

319
00:22:11,834 --> 00:22:15,429
My therapist showed me this chart.
It says that I'm 35 percent hetero.

320
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,232
And if I can get that up to 60 percent,

321
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:19,203
my parents won't
send me to military school.

322
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,168
You're bleeding.
I'm gonna get you a Kleenex.

323
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,511
Thanks.

324
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:28,912
Soon as it stops bleeding,
you'd best go.

325
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:31,747
You send me back now and
they're going to know we didn't do it.

326
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:35,482
Contrary to popular belief,
I'm not the world's personal whore bag.

327
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,824
I just figured, after yesterday,
you wouldn't mind.

328
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:41,023
You'd best go now.

329
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,162
Joan's family tree's due tomorrow.

330
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,135
Shouldn't we work on it?

331
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,230
Hm?

332
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,475
Sometimes...

333
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,377
...he hurts me.

334
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,844
[sniffling]

335
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,158
Well...

336
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,089
...he already thought we were doing it.

337
00:23:12,227 --> 00:23:14,195
What, am I going to save
my reputation now?

338
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:19,365
- You owe me one.
- Thank you.

339
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:22,095
- Thank you.
- Ah, ah! Mm-mm.

340
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,143
[paper crinkling]

341
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:42,718
Oh, shit.

342
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,059
It's lopsided.

343
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:49,494
Looks like we're gonna be spending
holidays with your side of the family.

344
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,223
We should put some on your side
just to balance it.

345
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:54,597
Maybe draw some birds
or something in the branches.

346
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,632
It just doesn't look very good.

347
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,508
I'm gonna show you something.

348
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,450
When I do, you can't say
it's stupid or nothing.

349
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:11,575
OK.

350
00:24:13,922 --> 00:24:17,323
- What did you do to your hair?
- It's Sue-Ann, you idiot.

351
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,949
Oh.

352
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:23,658
That your dad?

353
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,098
I found it in Sue-Ann's jewelry box
when I was little, and I swiped it.

354
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:30,034
- He's cute.
- Thanks.

355
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:33,937
- Let's put him in.
- I don't know his name.

356
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:36,476
I'm a real good drawer.
I could draw him in.

357
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,243
No, just do birds or something.

358
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:44,514
Poor Joan.

359
00:24:44,653 --> 00:24:47,213
She only has one grandpa,
and he's a total dick.

360
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,884
What are we gonna tell her?

361
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:53,561
They were high school sweethearts,

362
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:56,425
and he was handsome
and magical. [giggles]

363
00:24:56,565 --> 00:25:00,524
You know, if they were high school
sweethearts, he'd be in her yearbook.

364
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:04,537
I checked those, like, a zillion times.
He didn't go to her school.

365
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,368
Maybe he wasn't a student.

366
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,076
You take this one, OK?

367
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:26,956
Peggy?

368
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,187
What is that?

369
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:34,892
It's just as well.

370
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:37,835
I wasn't thrilled by the idea
of my dad being a pedophile.

371
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:45,042
This one don't have no signatures.

372
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,239
That's the year she dropped out,
'cause of me.

373
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:55,689
Ooh, football players are yummy.

374
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:57,553
Ah! They're the worst.

375
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:01,686
I mean, the idea and all is hot,
but that cream they use is so nasty.

376
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,924
I like they way they smell,
like Bengay and ferns.

377
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:08,366
- You have no self-respect.
- [giggling]

378
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:10,562
I'm gonna get some more food.
You want some?

379
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:13,467
OK.

380
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,782
- Danielle?
- What?

381
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:24,416
Found him.

382
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:39,061
Assistant coach, Danny Briggs.

383
00:26:41,036 --> 00:26:44,733
Danny? You're named after him.

384
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,605
[phone ringing]

385
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:50,734
[line ringing]

386
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,081
- [Danielle] Hello?
- Hey, baby. You doing OK?

387
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:56,411
Just fine.

388
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,246
Have you had time
to think about things?

389
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:00,184
Yeah.

390
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:04,651
You're right.
I do need a man in my life.

391
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:06,553
[whispers] It's working.

392
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:12,491
Listen, baby. In my bedroom under
the lamp, I left you some cash.

393
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:14,864
Go ahead and order
yourself a pizza. OK?

394
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:16,197
OK.

395
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:22,074
And we'll be back on Monday.

396
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,407
- OK.
- [whispers] Hey, you.

397
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,344
I love you.

398
00:27:30,318 --> 00:27:32,513
- OK.
- [dial tone]

399
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:41,252
This house is really nice.

400
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:43,523
Maybe there's another
Danny Briggs in Norman.

401
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:46,291
No, this is it.

402
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:51,338
Maybe you should've called first.

403
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:55,140
[knocking at door]

404
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,651
- Yeah?
- Hi.

405
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,108
Hi.

406
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:07,946
I'm Sue-Ann's little girl.

407
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,387
Good for you.

408
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,720
What can I do for you?

409
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:17,627
We're looking for Danny Briggs.
You him?

410
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,494
[man] Billy?

411
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,032
Who is it?

412
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,904
Let's see, we moved in here,
when, about a year ago?

413
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,808
Let's see... it was
right after my sister's wedding,

414
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:34,279
which was a week before
the space shuttle blew up.

415
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:37,408
- Such a sad time for the country.
- I'm still not over it.

416
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:42,016
I don't mean to be rude or nothing,
but where the fuck is my dad?

417
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,592
- You're saucy, I like that.
- Fresno, sweetie.

418
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:48,491
I like your house. It's super tasteful.

419
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,291
- Fresno?
- California.

420
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:51,990
You should've seen it
when we first moved in.

421
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,532
- [groans]
- That wife of his

422
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:55,727
had it all done up in faux country.

423
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:57,600
Oh, I hate that.

424
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,604
We almost didn't get
this house because of her.

425
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:02,539
When she found out we were in a
long-term committed life partnership.

426
00:29:02,677 --> 00:29:04,269
- Bitch.
- [Clarke sighs]

427
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:08,849
- Hey, you got an address?
- Does she even know about you?

428
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:11,509
Danny's wife? Oh, my God.

429
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,422
- They asked us to forward the mail.
- We never did. Oops.

430
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:22,860
Would you like to deliver it?

431
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,065
- Thanks.
- She is gonna shit twice and die.

432
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:29,932
- [all chuckling]
- You are bad.

433
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,198
- [whispers] California.
- [man] You are.

434
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,309
Get up!

435
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,179
- Come on, we have to go!
- Where do you want to eat breakfast?

436
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:44,785
You know, I think Sambo's
takes credit cards.

437
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,684
- You're taking me to California.
- You're a crazy person.

438
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:49,949
Ray took my keys or I'd drive myself.

439
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:52,082
Dani, my parents will kill me.

440
00:29:52,227 --> 00:29:54,821
Well, tell them you were
manipulated by my pussy.

441
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:57,397
I can't steal my dad's car.

442
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:02,095
I don't know what would happen,
but I imagine it would hurt. A lot.

443
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:05,731
I don't want to be a Mormon, Clarke.

444
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,570
It's my chance.

445
00:30:10,712 --> 00:30:12,077
I've never known my daddy.

446
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:15,046
And now I've got
a name and an address.

447
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,144
It's my hope.

448
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,217
Please?

449
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:26,455
I can't.

450
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:32,327
[Clarke] Mom, I'm home!

451
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:51,308
Did you have a good time?

452
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:57,587
What are we going
to do about you, Clarke?

453
00:31:00,328 --> 00:31:03,320
You know you're not supposed
to drink from the container!

454
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,233
Come here! Goddamn it!

455
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:09,732
Clarke! Clarke! Come here!

456
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:12,396
- Don't you take my car! Hey! Hey!
- [tires squeal]

457
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,303
[father shouting] Hey! God damn it!

458
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:17,678
Ow! [screaming] Clarke!

459
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:24,816
[horn honking]

460
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:26,181
Bring Joan!

461
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:31,286
[tires squealing]

462
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:32,654
[Danielle] Whoo!

463
00:31:32,794 --> 00:31:35,160
[Danielle] Dear Diary,

464
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:38,493
I am super excited
about our family vacation.

465
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,624
I'm only a week old and already

466
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,602
I'm seeing all the great sights
of this great land.

467
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,205
it is said that most American families

468
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,537
don't spend enough
quality time together.

469
00:31:49,678 --> 00:31:51,578
My family is different.

470
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:53,374
Whoo!

471
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:57,178
I ain't never been out of Oklahoma!
Goddamn!

472
00:31:57,318 --> 00:32:00,253
- Whoo!
- [both chuckling]

473
00:32:00,388 --> 00:32:03,186
My grandma lives in Dallas,
so I'm used to traveling.

474
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:06,384
- Have you ever seen the ocean?
- No.

475
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,727
I ain't never seen the ocean neither.

476
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:12,628
So when we get to Fresno,
we go to the beach.

477
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,667
[soft rock music plays on radio]

478
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:16,828
Don't you just love Melissa Manchester?

479
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:24,067
You know... I was thinking when we get
back, we could enter the talent show.

480
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:25,804
Do one of her songs.

481
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:28,812
I'm not going on no stage with you.

482
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,813
There's no way I'm signing up
for the talent show.

483
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,888
It just wouldn't be right in the
public eye to see the two of us

484
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,888
belting out the theme from ice Castles.

485
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:41,159
What if we did "Don't Cry Out Loud"?

486
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,161
Clarke, I'm not going back.

487
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,493
And that song sucks.

488
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:49,193
If you spill that, my dad'll kill me.

489
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:51,266
Baby...

490
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:55,273
...you came out of the closet,

491
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,004
stole his car and took off
with the class whore.

492
00:32:59,214 --> 00:33:01,705
You're the definition of dead.
[chuckles]

493
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:07,752
[phone ringing]

494
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,046
Hello?

495
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,624
[woman] i have
a collect call from Clarke.

496
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,284
Yes, yes.

497
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:18,322
- Clarke, honey, where are you?
- Is Daddy real mad at me?

498
00:33:18,466 --> 00:33:22,197
Honestly, honey,
I'm afraid of what he might do.

499
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:26,364
- Does he still want to send me away?
- Your father is...

500
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:30,103
...just sort of determined when he
makes up his mind about something.

501
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:31,974
I know.

502
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:34,479
We can just try
to convince him together.

503
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,243
All right, can you do that?

504
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,453
Clarke, are you with that girl?

505
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:47,583
- Peggy? Who was that?
- Nobody.

506
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:51,156
Let's go over to that girl's house.

507
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,789
Somebody should wait by the phone.

508
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,133
All right.

509
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:07,174
[Danielle] Did you tell
your parents where we are?

510
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:08,577
I swear to God, if you did, Clarke,

511
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,344
I will pull this car over
and kick your ass out!

512
00:34:11,486 --> 00:34:13,477
You are running toward something,
Danielle.

513
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:16,055
- I am just running away.
- Well, ain't that poetic?

514
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:18,853
My daddy's credit card is financing
this little adventure of yours.

515
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:23,054
- You have not even said, "Thank you."
- Some things go without saying.

516
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:25,996
Then I guess it goes without saying

517
00:34:26,134 --> 00:34:28,659
that you are the neatest person
that I have ever met!

518
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:31,033
And I am not afraid no more
when I'm around you,

519
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:33,936
'cause you are cooler
than I will ever be.

520
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:38,444
And It also goes without saying
that I would never tell on you!

521
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,579
[Danielle] I promise
I'll find a way to thank you.

522
00:35:16,384 --> 00:35:17,248
Breaker, breaker.

523
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,885
Got me a peeper in my sights.

524
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:23,989
[yelling] No! No!

525
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,752
[gasping]

526
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,158
[man] Breaking and entering,
was that really necessary?

527
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,661
I mean, couldn't you have just called?

528
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,924
That would've been
the neighborly thing to do.

529
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:35,729
I got an at-risk kid. And he is at risk.

530
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,030
Hm-hm.

531
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,332
Hey, I need some
medical attention here.

532
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,601
I got my ass bleeding like a sieve.

533
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,938
Oh, and you think
that's news around here?

534
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:52,141
[vibrating]

535
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:55,814
singing to Belinda Carlisle's "Heaven
ls A Place On Earth," [voice vibrating]

536
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:59,484
* Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

537
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:03,495
* They say in heaven love comes first

538
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:07,431
* We'll make heaven a place on earth

539
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:11,664
* Ooh, heaven is a place on earth... *

540
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:14,297
We were just passing through
and thought we'd stop by and say...

541
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,967
Hi. You live in a beautiful place.

542
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,976
Hi...

543
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,405
What do you think of my hair?

544
00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:22,743
Bonjour...

545
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,883
Hola...

546
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:30,916
It's so great to finally meet you.
I'm real excited to be... Shit.

547
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:37,020
How am I supposed to face my father?
I look like a fucking leper.

548
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:38,598
Where's Joan?

549
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:43,736
Oops.

550
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,635
Clarke.

551
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:49,538
- You've gotta be more careful with her.
- Sorry.

552
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:51,304
How would you like
to be dropped on your head?

553
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:54,540
I have been dropped on my head.
Daddy says Mama dropped me,

554
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:56,809
and that's what
accounts for my feminine ways.

555
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,509
You trying to make Joan a lesbian?

556
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:01,178
You gays are always trying
to convert everybody.

557
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:04,189
- [scoffs]
- Well, I don't see no damage.

558
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:06,725
None that Hatcher
would notice, anyway.

559
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:10,922
lf you're not going back, why are
you so worried about your grade?

560
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:15,598
Go to sleep.

561
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:18,103
A long day ahead of us tomorrow.

562
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,536
You ever tried Magic Fingers?

563
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,036
Lay down. [giggles]

564
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:33,514
OK, OK, now do this.

565
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:36,782
- [voice vibrating] Uh...
- [Danielle's voice vibrating] Uh...

566
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,949
[both laughing]

567
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:45,523
Oh! Shit! Goddamn it!

568
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,793
You can't yank like that, that fast!

569
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,903
Well, I see you made a friend.

570
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:52,666
Joseph?
What happened to your behind?

571
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:55,475
What took you so long?

572
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,979
Well, you took one car and Clarke
took the other and I had to walk.

573
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:02,582
I swear to God, Peggy.
I'm going to get my hands on him.

574
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:05,686
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I'm gonna do something probably.

575
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:07,579
Joseph?

576
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,719
I want you to promise me
that you will not hurt him.

577
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,124
You know how humiliating this is?

578
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:18,391
I got a biker rapist
picking glass out of my ass.

579
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:20,694
Well, our son could have called.

580
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:25,067
Am where am I? I am here,
bailing my husband out of jail.

581
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:28,300
Officer, could you just open this
damn cell door and let me out?

582
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:29,603
[keys jingling]

583
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:36,608
Officer, if I refuse
to take my husband right now,

584
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:38,514
what is going to happen?

585
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:41,121
Why, Peggy? You're not
refusing to take your husband.

586
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:44,486
Well, seeing as though it's the weekend,
the judge won't be here till Monday.

587
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:49,955
And would he have
to stay here all locked up?

588
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:51,565
- Hm-hm.
- No.

589
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,601
I don't have to stay locked up here,
because you're getting me out.

590
00:38:55,736 --> 00:38:59,103
- Then l refuse to take my husband.
- What?

591
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:01,974
I'm gonna go find our son.

592
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,137
And you are never, ever, ever

593
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,646
going to hurt him again.

594
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:13,618
Peggy, don't get emotional.
You're not supposed to get emotional.

595
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:15,813
You know what happens when you
get emotional, you get stupid.

596
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:22,562
Rot!

597
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:25,461
What's wrong with you?
Bust my fucking eardrum.

598
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:30,128
Peggy!

599
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,342
Peggy?

600
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,810
* Teena Marie: ["Lovergirl"]

601
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:43,246
- [Danielle and Clarke] Whoo!
- [Danielle] Dear Diary,

602
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:46,717
New Mexico is brown and flat.

603
00:39:46,854 --> 00:39:50,813
Mom does most of the driving, because
she thinks that Dad goes too slow.

604
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:55,226
Daddy is happy, being a man
and all, just navigating.

605
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:59,831
- He is a most excellent map reader.
- * Shoop-de-bop!

606
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:02,765
With the division of labor
so neatly divided

607
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:06,863
and both of them willing to stay in
their designated roles, I'm convinced...

608
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,134
* Funky pops!

609
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:11,370
...that I have the happiest
family there ever was.

610
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:13,446
* Coffee, tea or me baby

611
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,105
* Touché ole

612
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:19,185
* My opening line
might be a bit passe, yes

613
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,949
* But don't think that
I don't know what I'm feeling for you

614
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,083
* 'Cause I got a vibe on you the
first time that I saw you, saw you

615
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:30,959
* I need your love
and I won't bring no pain

616
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:34,431
* A little birdie told me
that you feel the same

617
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:38,801
* I'm for the real
and for you I'm true blue

618
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,398
* Let's make a deal, sugar
all I want to do is

619
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:47,276
* Be your one and only lover... *

620
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:48,712
Did you see that guy?

621
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:53,118
- Pull over.
- Press on we must, Clarke.

622
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:54,448
Press on we must.

623
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:56,523
You're the one who keeps saying
you need to get me laid.

624
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,056
[giggling]

625
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,995
[Ray] Sweetheart, did you
eat something today?

626
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:14,266
[Sue-Ann] Go on in, I'll whip
you up some flapjacks, OK?

627
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:16,399
Can I sleep in Danielle's room?

628
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,705
Honey, you can sleep
anywhere you want.

629
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:23,642
[Ray] Let's all just go inside.
Put your stuff away.

630
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,915
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

631
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:31,821
This is incredibly embarrassing,
but I have reason to believe

632
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,757
that my son has
run off with your daughter.

633
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:37,022
Oh, God, I should never
have left her alone.

634
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:39,291
Listen, horny children
are the least of my worries.

635
00:41:39,433 --> 00:41:42,095
- They'll turn up, they always do.
- My son is gay!

636
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:45,333
[whispers] Oh...

637
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:50,603
Oh, Lord, I never
said that out loud before.

638
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:52,979
Are you Clarke's mama?

639
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:56,777
I've lost my son.

640
00:41:57,952 --> 00:41:58,941
[Ray] Sue-Ann!

641
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:00,451
- [Sue-Ann] Yeah?
- [Ray] Someone broke in!

642
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:03,056
- There's glass all over your bed.
- What?

643
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,023
- Goodness.
- [Peggy] Oh...

644
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,392
My husband is just a little bit
testy when it comes to our son.

645
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,465
I promise I'll pay for any damages.

646
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:17,233
Oh, no. Oh, no.

647
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,865
[toilet flushing]

648
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,452
Excuse me.

649
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:45,022
Are those Bugle Boy jeans
that you're wearing?

650
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,594
It's this one right here.

651
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:57,374
[Clarke] Hey, Danielle.

652
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,308
Joel here is wondering if we
could drop him off in Vegas?

653
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,404
- I...
- I told him it wouldn't be a problem,

654
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:03,540
this being my car and everything.

655
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,675
I got a job there waiting for me.

656
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,186
- Listen, Joel...
- And the cool thing is that,

657
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:09,789
unlike some people...

658
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:13,092
...Joel is willing
to help out with expenses.

659
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:16,628
Yeah, I got money,
I just ain't got wheels.

660
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:17,890
Get in.

661
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:19,329
Danielle, you don't mind driving do you?

662
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,458
We don't know him.

663
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,070
You said you wanted to think
of a way to thank me?

664
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:26,605
This is a distraction
from our stated goals.

665
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:30,575
- You have your destiny, I have mine.
- Fuck.

666
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:36,944
Clarke and Joel
[chattering indistinctly]

667
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:42,579
[Danielle] Dear Diary, it turns out
that Daddy is a big, at whore.

668
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:46,325
I'm a lucky girl that I'm
learning such valuable lessons

669
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,918
- about the true nature o men.
- [Joel laughs]

670
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,725
- Oh, you like that.
- [giggling]

671
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:54,391
So what sort of work
do you have in Vegas?

672
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:55,968
Oh, it went right on my tooth.

673
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:57,661
[laughs] I'm a dancer.

674
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,335
Like on Fame.

675
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:04,774
Well, no. I'm not all that technical.
I'm more free form.

676
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:08,245
- Can you do splits?
- You dance for tips, right?

677
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:10,179
That's why you got all them singles.

678
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:14,045
It's my art. If people want
to give me money for my art,

679
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:15,985
that just makes me
a professional artist.

680
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,448
Right, you're a stripper.

681
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:21,390
- Erotic entertainer.
- Stripper.

682
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:22,959
Ow!

683
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:26,396
Lots of people can't make
a living doing what they love.

684
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:27,523
You're lucky.

685
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:31,361
You get me, don't you? Huh?

686
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,200
- You do, don't you?
- Stop.

687
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,070
[both laughing, yelling]

688
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:39,879
- I can do splits, too.
- [Clarke] You are bad.

689
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:43,381
Are you telling me
my little boy's in California?

690
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,645
- Sue-Ann?
- I kept it from her too long.

691
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:49,722
- How did this happen?
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

692
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:52,849
We are going to need
to contact Danielle's father.

693
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:54,426
What? Wait. No.

694
00:44:54,562 --> 00:44:58,555
- Wait a minute.
- Do you have feelings for this... guy?

695
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:02,032
- No, of course not!
- It's written all over your face.

696
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:04,296
We have an address.
Do we have a phone number?

697
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:06,338
You don't understand,
he don't know about her.

698
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:08,840
I don't know what I would say.
I thought this part of my life was over.

699
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,034
- It is over!
- Look, Ray!

700
00:45:10,177 --> 00:45:11,735
Don't be like that, all right?

701
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:14,245
Now this is a minor,
little big deal, OK?

702
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,372
I'm gonna take care of it and
then we're gonna be real happy.

703
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:20,248
This guy pops up out of nowhere,
putting all my plans in peril.

704
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:24,255
- If you could see yourself.
- I am doing the best that I can!

705
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:29,522
All right, everybody, calm down!
Jesus H. Christ!

706
00:45:29,663 --> 00:45:35,067
Look, there is obviously a lot of
feelings swirling around this place.

707
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,397
But we need to stay focused.

708
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:40,939
- Do you love me?
- This isn't about you, sir.

709
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:44,010
- Of course I do.
- This is about our children.

710
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:46,339
Now, as a father,
you should understand that.

711
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,879
Daddy?

712
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,684
I need to go after her, Ray.

713
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,282
And then you'll come back to me?

714
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,449
Of course I will.

715
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,663
Go get our girl.

716
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:07,660
[sighing]

717
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,239
- I'm a shitty mother.
- Join the club.

718
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:21,144
- [Danielle] This is on you, right?
- Sure thing.

719
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:31,156
Oh, he is so fine.

720
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,721
He's not gonna fuck you, Clarke.

721
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:38,263
Just telling you.
So start getting used to the idea.

722
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:41,459
If you were a real friend,
you wouldn't say stuff like that.

723
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,433
- Clarke.
- I gotta pee.

724
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:52,205
Hey.

725
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:00,287
Well, I sure do
appreciate your hospitality,

726
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:02,286
giving me a ride and all.

727
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:05,756
If you make him any promises,
you best follow through, motherfucker!

728
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:11,726
[pilot over PA]
Now we got a nice tailwind,

729
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:15,198
so our light time to Bakersield
should be just under three hours.

730
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:17,395
Sit back and enjoy the light.

731
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,540
[slow-tempo song plays]

732
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:40,157
And I thought the
Boy Scouts taught me nothing.

733
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:44,060
Out of all the hitchhikers in the world,

734
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,860
how did we get one
so masculine and capable?

735
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:49,868
Oh, well, you learn a few things
when you're on your own.

736
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:57,077
- Were you a Boy Scout, Clarke?
- For like a week in second grade.

737
00:47:57,211 --> 00:48:01,807
They... They gave us these boxes
of candy to sell door to door.

738
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,975
I ate all mine,
so my mom gave me the money

739
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,610
to buy the whole box,
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

740
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,923
My dad was so mad.

741
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,083
Said the two of us was in cahoots.

742
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,164
My daddy took off when I was little.

743
00:48:22,503 --> 00:48:23,527
Like Dani's.

744
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,366
Mine took off
before I was born, so I win.

745
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:30,403
Are we competing?

746
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,613
I'm just saying I probably had it worse.

747
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:37,878
You know what it's like then,
don't you?

748
00:48:39,887 --> 00:48:42,117
That crazy thing when you
look for him everywhere.

749
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:47,319
Anytime you're in a crowd,
there's a chance, so you...

750
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:52,091
...walk around a little straighter,
hoping to look your best, just in case.

751
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:59,401
Looking everywhere for somebody
who don't want to be found.

752
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:10,016
I want to hear more about your art.

753
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,141
Show us.

754
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,753
- You guys are crazy.
- [Danielle] Come on.

755
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:21,486
[up-tempo rock song plays on radio]

756
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:25,792
We got the music,
and the fancy lighting.

757
00:49:25,933 --> 00:49:29,801
- All that's missing is a pole.
- It's cold out.

758
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:32,770
- Keeps everything perky.
- [laughs]

759
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:37,775
Aw, this one's too fast.
I only dance to the slow ones.

760
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:39,705
It's kind of my signature.

761
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,673
All right, this one's a ballad.

762
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,115
[switching channels]

763
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,414
[slow-tempo song plays]

764
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:55,354
I cannot believe I'm doing this
out in the middle of nowhere.

765
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,630
You best appreciate it.

766
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,963
I promise I do.

767
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:05,367
OK, see now, the trick is
to dance in your own world.

768
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,572
Let them come to you.

769
00:52:50,037 --> 00:52:51,265
Joel?

770
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:56,732
[thunder rumbling]

771
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,645
Hey.

772
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:07,820
I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

773
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,547
but you will get over it.

774
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,056
I fell in love last night,
and now he's gone.

775
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:17,088
- My one chance at happiness.
- Stop acting like a girl.

776
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,198
You drove him away.

777
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:22,097
Clarke, I'm gonna stop
this conversation right now

778
00:53:22,235 --> 00:53:24,863
until you adjust your thinking.

779
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:28,532
Welcome to life, Clarke, you're
just another tainted grown-up.

780
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:30,666
Jesus Christ.

781
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:34,212
There's no room in this world
for a love like ours.

782
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:36,441
They hate us for it.

783
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:39,953
[engine sputtering]

784
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,186
Shit! No.

785
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:48,191
Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

786
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,637
Agh! Stupid, fucking shit car!

787
00:54:05,779 --> 00:54:07,644
Joel would know what
to do if he where here.

788
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:12,280
- We'd best start walking.
- Yes, you'd best.

789
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:14,785
Clarke, let's go.

790
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:17,890
You're the one with
the reason to live. You walk.

791
00:54:22,162 --> 00:54:23,857
OK. You know what?

792
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:28,127
When I get to the next town
I'm gonna call your father! Agh!

793
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:30,058
- Fuck!
- Fine!

Do I look OK?

797

He is gonna die.

[indistinct radio chatter]

[man] All right, mister.
Your time is up.

800
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,144
We found your car.

801
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:26,253
You found it?

802

[up-tempo song plays]

803
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:29,561
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

804
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:33,530
- Do y'all have a pillow I could use?
- Sure.

805
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:44,643
[man] One tank of gas, $1 5.

806
00:55:44,778 --> 00:55:46,973
I'll have my dad give you
a ride back to your car.

807
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:49,275
Will that be cash or charge?

808
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:51,611
- Charge.
- Cash.

809
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:54,777
I am sick of paying your way.
You're hateful, and ungrateful.

810
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:58,220
- Don't be an asshole.
- You got an emergency fund.

811
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,191
Use it.

812
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:03,261
I can't.

813
00:56:03,396 --> 00:56:06,263
Why spend your own money when you
can spend somebody else's, right?

814
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:09,896
I don't have it anymore.

815
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:12,366
You spent it?

816
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:15,173
The only cash we have?

817
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:19,402
You are a selfish bitch.

818
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,973
- What did you buy yourself, huh?
- It's what I bought you!

819
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:32,519
I wanted to do something nice
for you, to thank you.

820
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,754
Hm?

821
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:41,129
And you liked him so much.

822
00:56:43,436 --> 00:56:45,267
He didn't think I was sexy.

823
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,439
I'm sure he did.
It was just extra encouragement.

824
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:00,413
Clarke!

825
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:12,292
I need your credit card.

826
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,874
That's what I get
for marrying a faggot. [chuckles]

827
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:29,738
This'll just be a minute.

828
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:34,413
Collect, from Clarke.

829
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:39,290
- Clarke, run! Run! Shit! Uh...
- What?

00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:42,554
Hey, get back here!
Come on, Dad, come on!

831
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:43,924
What the fuck?

832
00:57:44,064 --> 00:57:45,759
I'm gonna call the cops,
you stay with them!

833
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:48,800
Your card's been reported stolen!
They're gonna know where we are!

834
00:57:48,935 --> 00:57:50,027
Shit! Shit!

835
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,967
[Clarke] Danielle wait up,
where you going?

836
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:06,349
Hey. I want to enter
the stripping competition.

837
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:08,249
- Where's the sign-up sheet?
- You're looking at him.

838
00:58:08,388 --> 00:58:11,653
- Great.
- It wouldn't exactly be appropriate.

839
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,021
I'm young,
but I got the moves. Trust me.

840
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,186
- He'll vouch for me, OK?
- She's done her research.

841
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,891
That prize money's mine.
Come on, give me a chance.

But if you think you can win
these boys over, be my guest.

844
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:30,473
Mister, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

[up-tempo song plays]

846
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:42,917
Let's hear it for Jade!

847

Beginning of the second chorus,
that's when you throw the water on me.

848
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:50,724
- You got it?
- Dani, you don't have to do this.

849
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:55,560
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

850
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:57,636
Like you don't approve.

851
00:58:57,771 --> 00:59:02,140
Just, don't show them nothing, OK?

852
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:06,511
- I won't.
- Promise?

853
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,581
I'll just bat my eyelids
and shake my shoulders.

854
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:12,647
- I'm sure Jade's got nothing on me.
- Sure.

855
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:16,444
- You got a better idea?
- We can go home.

856
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:24,229
- Got your music?
- Yeah.

857
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:28,161
You're up, young'un.

858
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,896
Second chorus, Clarke.

859
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:33,665
[up-tempo song plays]

860
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:38,107
[man] For all you boys who
like 'em young, we got a special treat.

861
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:42,374
A little lady thinks she can
unseat the undisputed champion.

862
00:59:42,515 --> 00:59:47,475
Direct from Tornado Alley,
90 pounds of dynamite!

863
00:59:48,488 --> 00:59:50,456
It's Danielle!

864
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,533
[man] Get off my stage!

865
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:23,422
[man booing]

866
01:00:28,862 --> 01:00:31,023
[men booing]

867
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:43,172
- Tough crowd.
- Them boys like it from Jade.

868
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,743
Ain't nobody sexier than Danielle.

869
01:00:46,346 --> 01:00:48,610
[man laughing]

870
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:53,409
Oh! l beg your pardon.

871
01:00:55,555 --> 01:00:58,547
Oh, my God. They're gay! Dani, stop!

872
01:01:00,794 --> 01:01:03,319
- They're gay, Dani!
- What?

873
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:05,488
- They're gay.
- But they're so ugly.

874
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:07,657
- Let's get you out of here.
- No.

875
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:10,531
- We can't give up now.
- Danielle, they don't like you.

876
01:01:11,704 --> 01:01:14,138
- You have to do it.
- I can't.

877
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:16,674
- Yes, you can.
- I am not like you.

878
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,271
What would Joel do?

879
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:29,418
[Joel] OK, see now, the trick
is to dance in your own world.

880
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,981
Let 'em come to you.

881
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:51,602
[men] Yeah!

882
01:01:58,785 --> 01:02:00,776
Whoo!

883
01:02:10,396 --> 01:02:12,990
[crowd cheering]

884
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:24,443
- [man] By an overwhelming majority...
- Jesus Christ!

885
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:27,273
...and winner of
the 50-dollar prize money,

886
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:30,746
- the new champ is...
- Clarke!

887
01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:36,451
This is fucking kidnapping,
you ugly motherfucker!

888
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:40,047
Hey! I don't need any of your
goddamn lip! And don't you hit my car!

889
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:42,787
It's because of you my son's
gone completely off the deep end.

890
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:46,023
Your son was a miserable, whiny,

891
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:48,463
dishrag before I got my hands on him.

892
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,627
Yeah, and you turned him into
a full-blown cocksucker, didn't you?

893
01:02:52,238 --> 01:02:53,705
It's over for you, boy.

894
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,933
Soon as we drop your
little friend off here,

895
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:57,872
your ass is going straight
to the military academy.

896
01:02:58,011 --> 01:02:59,171
[screaming]

897
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:00,939
I'm gonna pull this car
over right now, goddamn it,

898
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,447
- and set your ass at the curb.
- And what are you gonna do, huh?

899
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:06,984
Smack her around?
Knock some sense into her?

900
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,712
That's enough of your shit, Clarke.

901
01:03:10,423 --> 01:03:13,256
I'll tell you what. I like cocks.

902
01:03:13,393 --> 01:03:15,190
Jesus Christ!
What did you just say, Clarke?!

903
01:03:15,328 --> 01:03:19,128
- I like the dreamy, creamy taste...
- Shut the fuck up, Clarke!

904
01:03:19,265 --> 01:03:22,962
Somebody pass me a cracker
for all that dick cheese!

905
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,797
[tires squealing]

906
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:28,597
God! Jesus Christ!

907
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,641
Take the money, take Joan,

908
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:32,506
- and get out of here.
- I mean her, I know!

909
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:34,670
If I'm good at anything,
it's how to take a punch. Trust me.

910
01:03:34,814 --> 01:03:37,408
- OK, when I say run, you run. OK?
- Hey, don't touch him!

911
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,381
You don't say that
kind of shit to your dad!

912
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,512
- Get off me!
- Don't you hurt him!

913
01:03:43,656 --> 01:03:46,784
Go! Run, Dani, run!

914
01:03:46,926 --> 01:03:49,986
- Run, Dani!
- Fuck!

915
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:52,359
Why the fuck are you like this?

916
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:58,237
[slow-tempo song plays]

917
01:03:58,237 --> 01:03:59,932
[slow-tempo song plays]

918
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:31,365
[Danielle] Dear Diary...

919
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:35,134
...Daddy had to leave.

920
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:38,502
As daddies sometimes do.

921
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:45,912
He left so the dreams o
our family could come true.

922
01:04:49,355 --> 01:04:51,380
But Mommy will soldier on.

923
01:04:53,926 --> 01:04:57,157
Because that is what mommies do.

924
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:42,704
[man] We're here.

925
01:06:20,747 --> 01:06:22,078
Where's my father?

926
01:06:22,915 --> 01:06:24,405
Danielle.

927
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:27,979
We should just head on home now, OK?

928
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,122
- Is that his wife?
- Yes, it is.

929
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:33,657
- Can I go say hello to her?
- No, you may not.

930
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:35,761
We have caused these people
enough trouble.

931
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:39,126
Can I come in? I'm really tired
and I need to use the restroom.

932
01:06:39,265 --> 01:06:41,893
Taxi! Wait, please, thank you.

933
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:43,524
Where's my boy?

934
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:46,605
His daddy found us.

935
01:06:46,739 --> 01:06:50,004
If he is hurt, I'm going to hold you
personally responsible, young lady.

936
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:52,270
- OK, OK...
- Let go!

937
01:06:52,979 --> 01:06:54,344
No, no! No!

938
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,472
You... You get back here!

939
01:06:57,617 --> 01:06:58,675
You get back here.

940
01:06:58,818 --> 01:07:00,149
You listen to your mama!

941
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,283
You come back here! Baby!

942
01:07:24,477 --> 01:07:25,671
Come on.

943
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:36,212
Danny Briggs?

944
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:45,529
You must be Sue-Ann's little girl.

945
01:07:45,665 --> 01:07:47,132
Uh-huh.

946
01:07:50,236 --> 01:07:52,397
Damned if you ain't
the spitting image of your mama.

947
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:53,869
Yeah...

948
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,471
People think we're sisters all the time.

949
01:08:00,346 --> 01:08:03,315
- You can't be here!
- It's OK, Janet.

950
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:06,915
Daniel, this is not what we discussed.

951
01:08:07,053 --> 01:08:08,850
Just go back inside, all right?

952
01:08:08,988 --> 01:08:11,456
It's fine. Just go inside, let us talk.

953
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:13,547
Go on.

954
01:08:20,366 --> 01:08:21,799
Hey...

955
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,469
Don't mind her, she's a little upset.

956
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:32,468
Them boys you sold the house to, told
me she was kind of high-strung, and all.

957
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:34,910
I was prepared in my mentality.

958
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:36,378
[chuckling]

959
01:08:39,118 --> 01:08:40,813
That makes you a pretty smart girl.

960
01:08:50,062 --> 01:08:55,967
You know, the secret to making
a good burger is to only flip it once.

961
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:02,973
- Hey.
- [crying] I knew... I knew it.

962
01:09:04,944 --> 01:09:07,811
- It's OK. It's OK.
- [whimpering]

963
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:32,098
These last few days have been
really strange for me, Danielle.

964
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:37,475
I hadn't seen your mom
in such a long time.

965
01:09:39,745 --> 01:09:42,976
- Yeah, it must be weird.
- [chuckles]

966
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:45,276
Yeah, weird's a good word. It was weird.

967
01:09:45,418 --> 01:09:47,181
Super-duper weird.

968
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,788
Even better, super-duper weird.
I like that one.

969
01:09:55,094 --> 01:09:56,789
Danielle, I didn't know about you.

970
01:10:00,032 --> 01:10:02,523
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

971
01:10:02,668 --> 01:10:03,999
I mean...

972
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,768
I thought she was gonna get rid of it.

973
01:10:16,782 --> 01:10:17,874
[sighs]

974
01:10:19,485 --> 01:10:24,889
I'm... I'm not proud
of myself, Danielle.

975
01:10:27,093 --> 01:10:28,754
She decided to keep me?

976
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:33,031
I had no idea.

977
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,469
You know what this means?

978
01:10:42,742 --> 01:10:43,800
What?

979
01:10:43,943 --> 01:10:46,411
It means I don't have to forgive you
for running out on us.

980
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:48,274
And I was kind of
looking forward to that.

981
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:53,780
It would mean a lot to me
if you did just that.

982
01:10:53,919 --> 01:10:55,682
If you'd forgive me.

983
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:00,720
Done.

984
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,967
Bet you missed a lot of school
coming to see me like this.

985
01:11:12,071 --> 01:11:14,301
Only a couple of days.
I brought my homework.

986
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,907
Well, you gotta be
in a hurry to get back.

987
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,033
I mean, your friends,
this time of year in school...

988
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:20,145
I don't know what Sue-Ann told you...

989
01:11:21,914 --> 01:11:25,816
...but our situation ain't really ideal.

990
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,784
And I know it's a shock,
me being here and all.

991
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:31,588
But if it would be all right,

992
01:11:31,724 --> 01:11:33,487
and I know it would take
a lot of adjusting...

993
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:35,821
Honey, honey...

994
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:38,525
You can't stay here.

995
01:11:39,465 --> 01:11:41,296
I'd keep my room real nice.

996
01:11:43,436 --> 01:11:45,199
Danielle, I'm a stranger to you.

997
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:50,174
You're my daddy.

998
01:11:59,785 --> 01:12:02,379
You seem like you're
a really sweet girl.

999
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:06,318
And I know that I'd be
very proud of you.

1000
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:09,690
[sobbing] Don't bet on it.

1001
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:11,729
But you just...

1002
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:13,855
Daddy? Who's that?

1003
01:12:13,999 --> 01:12:16,092
Sweetie, this is one of my students.

1004
01:12:16,235 --> 01:12:18,829
Why don't you run on back inside,
OK, and finish your nap?

1005
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:24,768
- [Danielle] Hi.
- What's your name?

1006
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:28,311
[sniffling] Danielle. What's yours?

1007
01:12:28,447 --> 01:12:31,575
- Tiffany. And you know what?
- What?

1008
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:35,118
[Tiffany] My daddy's taking me
to Disneyland on my birthday.

1009
01:12:35,254 --> 01:12:39,486
Wow, that makes you a really lucky girl.

1010
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,559
Hey, hey, the tickle monster's coming.

1011
01:12:41,694 --> 01:12:42,956
- Where you going?
- [giggling]

1012
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:45,825
[Tiffany laughing]

1013
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,092
Got you, I got you!

1014
01:12:52,371 --> 01:12:55,829
I want you to go upstairs and be a
good girl and finish your nap now, OK?

1015
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:59,639
- Bye, Danielle.
- Bye, Tiffany.

1016
01:13:02,548 --> 01:13:03,810
I'm sorry about that.

1017
01:13:06,318 --> 01:13:09,981
- She's real cute.
- Yes, she is.

1018
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:12,921
Yeah.

1019
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,492
I bet she's your pride and joy.

1020
01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:18,757
You could say that.

1021
01:13:25,271 --> 01:13:27,330
I think I need to go, huh?

1022
01:13:32,077 --> 01:13:33,567
Probably be a good idea.

1023
01:13:37,616 --> 01:13:39,379
[gate opening]

1024
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:48,525
[gasping sob]

1025
01:13:49,695 --> 01:13:51,162
Mommy.

1026
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:01,165
Oh, my baby.

1027
01:14:03,142 --> 01:14:05,133
- [sobbing]
- Oh, my baby.

1028
01:14:05,277 --> 01:14:06,767
Oh, my baby.

1029
01:14:10,983 --> 01:14:13,747
I'm so stupid.

1030
01:14:20,726 --> 01:14:22,956
[whispers] Oh, God, I love you.

1031
01:15:05,137 --> 01:15:06,365
Will you help me?

1032
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:11,370
Sure.

1033
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,188
Oh, isn't he something, that hair?

1034
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:26,814
Yeah, I think he's cute, that one.

1035
01:15:26,959 --> 01:15:30,122
He's got beautiful eyes.
Oh, he's dreamy.

1036
01:15:30,262 --> 01:15:33,060
- Maybe I'll hang this up in my room.
- [laughing]

1037
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:35,462
I think Ray wouldn't
like that very much.

1038
01:15:37,036 --> 01:15:38,765
I think this one's cute, up here.

1039
01:15:38,904 --> 01:15:43,238
Yeah, he is. You are so bad.

1040
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:46,902
You're my daughter.
You learned from the best.

1041
01:15:48,414 --> 01:15:49,972
[bell ringing]

1042
01:15:55,387 --> 01:15:58,686
- Mrs. Gardner.
- What are you doing here?

1043
01:15:58,824 --> 01:16:02,817
- I wanted to see how Clarke's doing.
- Oh.

1044
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:08,432
Well, um... he's gonna be fine.

1045
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:11,661
- It's all gonna be fine.
- Is he at that school?

1046
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:14,667
There's a lot going on here,

1047
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:17,367
so that's the best place
for him right now.

1048
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:20,136
Where's his daddy?

1049
01:16:20,846 --> 01:16:23,508
He's getting himself a little apartment.

1050
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,215
I broke up your family.

1051
01:16:29,855 --> 01:16:31,117
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:16:31,757 --> 01:16:33,918
You did not break up our family.

1053
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,459
You have all these ideas about
what it is to be a good parent.

1054
01:16:38,597 --> 01:16:42,033
And everybody says that if you just
do your best, that's all that matters.

1055
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:45,295
But... it's not true.

1056
01:16:45,437 --> 01:16:50,136
I mean, if your best stinks,
then what good are you?

1057
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:54,178
I don't mean to do you
no disrespect, ma'am...

1058
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:57,740
...but Clarke would rather be with you.

1059
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:11,090
Danielle.

1060
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,563
Tell your mama I said hello.

1061
01:17:23,609 --> 01:17:25,338
[Danielle] I guess you
could say our little girl's

1062
01:17:25,477 --> 01:17:30,471
been through
a whole lot in her short life.

1063
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:33,312
She's learned that sometimes

1064
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:36,853
you got to accept
what life throws at you.

1065
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:41,619
But only after a really good fight,
to find out what you're made of.

1066
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:46,825
It's the fight that makes
the accepting bearable.

1067
01:17:46,965 --> 01:17:48,728
Very nice, Danielle.

1068
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:50,391
- I'm not done.
- OK.

1069
01:17:53,238 --> 01:17:55,570
She also misses her daddy a whole lot.

1070
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:01,212
And hopes that someday her family
will be brought back together...

1071
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:03,909
...'cause it's real fun.

1072
01:18:06,685 --> 01:18:08,880
[applause]

1073
01:18:12,191 --> 01:18:14,159
[Mulray] You've come
a long way, Danielle.

1074
01:18:14,293 --> 01:18:16,887
Miss Hatcher says you're doing great,
that you're more involved.

1075
01:18:17,062 --> 01:18:19,587
I even hear you signed up
for the talent show.

1076
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:22,461
I'm working on being a more
traditional type of person.

1077
01:18:22,601 --> 01:18:26,697
I might be taking a risk here,
but if you promise that I can trust you,

1078
01:18:26,839 --> 01:18:28,807
I'll put you back with the normal kids.

1079
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:32,640
Can I trust you?

1080
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:38,709
Good.

1081
01:18:38,851 --> 01:18:40,250
[up-tempo music plays]

1082
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:03,240
[cheering, applause]

1083
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:05,707
Let's hear it for Perpetual Motion.

1084
01:19:12,784 --> 01:19:14,877
And now...

1085
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,888
...for the musical stylings
of Miss Danielle Edmonston.

1086
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:25,590
playing Melissa Manchester's
["Don't Cry Out Loud"]

1087
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:39,237
Clarke wanted this here to be a duet.

1088
01:19:39,378 --> 01:19:43,678
May sound corny,
but this is for my baby's daddy.

1089
01:19:45,117 --> 01:19:47,108
And this here's his favorite song.

1090
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:53,516
* Baby cried the day
the circus came to town

1091
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,457
* 'Cause she didn't want
parades just passing by her

1092
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:06,661
* So she painted on a smile
and took off with some clown

1093
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:13,009
* And she danced
without a net up on the wire

1094
01:20:14,746 --> 01:20:20,048
* I know a lot about her
'cause you see

1095
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,556
* Baby is an awful lot like me

1096
01:20:27,793 --> 01:20:32,492
* Don't cry out loud

1097
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:36,158
* Just keep it inside

1098
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:40,032
* Learn how to hide your feelings

1099
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:45,337
* Fly high and proud

1100
01:20:45,477 --> 01:20:48,708
* And if you should fall

1101
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:54,843
* Remember you almost had it all

1102
01:20:58,991 --> 01:21:02,791
* Baby saw that when they
pulled the big top down

1103
01:21:04,763 --> 01:21:10,724
* They left behind her dreams
among the litter

1104
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:15,465
[voice wavering] * And the different
kind of love she thought she'd found

1105
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:22,647
* There's nothing there
but sawdust and some glitter

1106
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:28,651
* But baby can't be broken
'cause you see

1107
01:21:28,787 --> 01:21:33,918
* She had the finest teacher,
that was... [whimpering]

1108
01:21:34,059 --> 01:21:35,651
* I taught her...

1109
01:21:35,794 --> 01:21:39,855
* Don't cry out loud

1110
01:21:39,998 --> 01:21:42,523
* Just keep it inside

1111
01:21:42,668 --> 01:21:46,866
* Learn how to hide your feelings

1112
01:21:47,005 --> 01:21:51,772
* Fly high and proud

1113
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,743
* And if you should fall

1114
01:21:54,880 --> 01:22:00,876
* Remember you almost had it all

1115
01:22:10,162 --> 01:22:14,531
* Don't cry out loud

1116
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:17,464
* Just keep it inside

1117
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:21,732
* Learn how to hide your feelings

1118
01:22:21,873 --> 01:22:26,003
* Fly high and proud

1119
01:22:26,144 --> 01:22:29,409
* And if you should fall

1120
01:22:29,548 --> 01:22:34,485
* Remember you almost had it all *

1121
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:36,951
[Danielle] Dear Diary,

1122
01:22:37,089 --> 01:22:39,319
this world is full of dipshits.

1123
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:42,621
But guess what?
Mommy got a fairy-tale ending.

1124
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:44,656
Because Daddy?

1125
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,521
Daddy came back.

1126
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:52,433
[bell ringing]

1127
01:22:54,473 --> 01:22:56,668
[Danielle] So they let you out
for good behavior or something?

1128
01:22:56,808 --> 01:22:59,868
My mama came and got me.
Said she was compelled.

1129
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:02,239
What did you do to your hair?

1130
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,575
- You don't like it?
- Hell, no.

1131
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,520
Better? I'm glad you're back.

1132
01:23:12,124 --> 01:23:13,591
I don't know, I kind of miss that place.

1133
01:23:13,725 --> 01:23:15,022
Shut up.

1134
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,684
In a school with no girls,
I was very popular.

1135
01:23:16,828 --> 01:23:20,093
- You fucking whore.
- Thank you.

1136
01:23:20,232 --> 01:23:22,996
Remember, Clarke,
nobody likes a dirty girl.

1137
01:23:23,635 --> 01:23:25,227
Right.

1138
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:28,731
[up-tempo song plays]
