1
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:42,433
Faster! They close on us!

2
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:52,236
No!

3
00:00:52,346 --> 00:00:55,247
- l'm sorry, Princess. No! Go!
- We must go back!

4
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,820
No!

5
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,029
Come on.

6
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:20,036
The Edenock moon is in convergence.

7
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,273
Find the wizard, Richard Conrad.

8
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:36,753
l am Princess Aleya of Havenock,

9
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,955
- the youngest daughter of late Lord...
- We know who you are.

10
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,816
Bring her to me.

11
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:13,350
Evening boys.

12
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,452
The wizard!

13
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,753
Don't worry fellas, l saved you some.

14
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:18,745
The girl will be mine!

15
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,250
We'll see about that.

16
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,268
Wizard?

17
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,202
l haven't fought that many orcs
in thirty...

18
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,364
- Wizard!
- Getting to old for?

19
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:49,840
Won't be long.
A new sentinel, always comes.

20
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:52,915
- He'll protect you.
- No! No!

21
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,222
Watch for him.

22
00:04:56,623 --> 00:05:00,423
No! Wizard, please! No!

23
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,067
Come on, Norton.
Time to move.

24
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:58,115
Jonathan? Are you in there?

25
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,284
lt's Katie?

26
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,650
Katie McQueen with Dunwich Realty?

27
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:08,187
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
l tried calling you on the phone but.

28
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:09,728
What do you want?

29
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,361
l have great news.
l found the perfect place for you.

30
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:15,196
lt's totally secluded,
there's no neighbors for miles.

31
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:17,566
lt's a bit of a fixer-upper
but it's in your price range.

32
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:19,296
So, it's everything you've asked for.

33
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,408
l'll take it.

34
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,605
Great. Okay, thank you.

35
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,345
So, you were in the military?

36
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,212
Yep.

37
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,792
Did you just get out?

38
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,127
More or less.

39
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,391
Thank you,
for your service, you know. l mean,

40
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,831
you hear about all these celebrities
and athletes but...

41
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,670
you're the real American hero.
Thank you.

42
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,109
l think you're going to love this property.

43
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,815
lt's perfect for you.

44
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:07,483
Yeah, baby!

45
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,953
Howdy, ma'am

46
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,315
Hey, pretty lady!

47
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:14,394
You seem to be working
that gear shifter right nice. Yeah!

48
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,120
- Come on, baby!
- Okay.

49
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,761
l forgot to mention,

50
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:24,427
this property comes
with a quaint hometown feel.

51
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:27,098
Brought to you by colorful,
rusticated locals.

52
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,308
So, what do you think?

53
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,683
lt's perfect.

54
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,623
Ready to see inside?

55
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:53,289
l'll take it from here, thanks.

56
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,154
Oh,..

57
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:57,421
okay.

58
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:03,759
Congratulations on being
a new home owner.

59
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,690
Hey!

60
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:23,321
Bokkvir, the Filth of Nemis.

61
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:26,190
Putrid Worm of Felmreck.

62
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:30,091
Ungod of the After-Depths.

63
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:33,236
We do obeisance to thee.

64
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:40,609
Sanction our hunt this night
and grant us our prey.

65
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,143
Bokkvir!

66
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:05,233
Are you the Worldgate Sentinel?

67
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,999
Uh, no.

68
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:14,709
Okay, l'm John Norton, this is my land.

69
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,145
You are trespassing.

70
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:20,912
- What's with the ears?
- l am Aleya of Havenock,

71
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,583
youngest daughter of the late
Lord Darkton of?

72
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,485
Okay, well,
you're going to have to leave.

73
00:14:24,557 --> 00:14:27,890
No. l am awaiting the new Sentinel.

74
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:34,423
Okay, um, something's seriously
awry is going on, with all that.

75
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,195
Here, why don't you just
come with me,

76
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:38,566
l'll take you into town
and we'll have?

77
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,509
Dammit.

78
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,855
Wizard!

79
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:17,168
We've come for the girl, wizard!

80
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,404
Who's there?

81
00:16:24,344 --> 00:16:25,504
Show yourself.

82
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,720
What the hell?

83
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,311
Where is the girl?

84
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,776
This is private property.

85
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,513
Kill him.

86
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:37,510
There you go.

87
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,627
Get off my land.

88
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,732
You have no magic, human.

89
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,594
Tear out his spine.

90
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,319
Another time, wizard.

91
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:22,284
You, John Norton, are the Guardian.

92
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:26,350
Come on, Norton. Time to move.

93
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,263
Norton, you better come check this out.

94
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,212
You, John Norton, are the Guardian.

95
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:54,252
Richard Conrad, took Crooked Finger's
place as Worldgate's Sentinel.

96
00:19:56,722 --> 00:20:00,715
A Sentinel of the Worldgate as now
you have take Conrad's place.

97
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,630
A Sentinel of the Worldgate.
A sentinel of the Worldgate.

98
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,229
Not again.

99
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:12,601
You, John Norton, are the Guardian.

100
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,645
Welcome back to the land of the living.

101
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:34,886
Where am l?

102
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:37,089
Right where you're supposed to be.

103
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:41,390
Drink it.

104
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,096
lt will return your strength.

105
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,344
You mend quickly.

106
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:00,350
That will come in handy.

107
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:03,179
Thank you?

108
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,221
Whitefeather.

109
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,286
John Norton.

110
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,761
What were those things?

111
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:16,264
They are the fey children,
scourge of Nemis.

112
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:22,431
Known across the worlds as orcs.

113
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,908
Okay, whatever.

114
00:21:29,982 --> 00:21:31,779
The cave up there is a Worldgate.

115
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:35,878
There are many Worldgates
connecting the nine worlds,

116
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:40,358
and each draws it's own Sentinel
to keep the realms in balance.

117
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:45,127
Fate. Circumstance. Coincidence.

118
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:46,997
Destiny.

119
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,068
None is sure how it works.

120
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,064
But from the beginning,

121
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:56,169
a warrior has always come
to stand guard over the Worldgates.

122
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,244
Some stay long, some not long.

123
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,343
But a warrior always comes.

124
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,712
What's your stake in all this?

125
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:15,283
l assist the Sentinel
when and where l can.

126
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:20,597
Okay, that's enough of this.

127
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:25,999
You, John Norton, are the Guardian.

128
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,100
A Sentinel of the Worldgate.

129
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:31,538
Yeah, you already said that.

130
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,476
l don't believe l did.

131
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:44,980
Speak.

132
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:47,321
A new human protects the elf.

133
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:53,060
A wizard. Strong, like the old one,
stronger even.

134
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,991
Fangmark remains on the other side,
in Edenock.

135
00:22:57,303 --> 00:23:00,101
His orcs stayed back.
He can still get the girl.

136
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:01,501
Yes.

137
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:13,184
What is that?

138
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:18,183
Pull!

139
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:20,585
Pull!

140
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:24,729
Pull!

141
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:33,698
ls this the new all powerful
wizard Gorejaw spoke of?

142
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,732
l do no fear this wizard.

143
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:43,012
Follow him. He will lead us to the girl.

144
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:46,576
So then they was like, Scooter,

145
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,346
you ain't never gonna
get that over your head.

146
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,216
Then granny comes out
with a wooden spoon.

147
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,087
Scooter, shut up and go get firewood.

148
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,717
Why do l always have to get the firewood?

149
00:23:54,827 --> 00:23:57,762
Because you suck at telling stories, get out!

150
00:23:58,397 --> 00:24:02,333
Leroy, you always make me
do so much stuff.

151
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:04,158
Nice one, Leeroy.

152
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:06,796
You know what?
You can go get firewood too!

153
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,172
But l got a good story.

154
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:18,309
Oh gosh.

155
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,277
Are you the wizard?

156
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,853
No, l'm adopted.

157
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,218
l'm looking for the Sentinel.
Where can l find him?

158
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,755
l'm not sure what that is but...

159
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:27,918
whatever it is l'll help you out,
l promise.

160
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:30,222
And in a straight up, non-pervy way.

161
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:32,056
What the hell?

162
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,062
lt's not what it looks like.
We weren't doing anything.

163
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:39,234
- What do we have here, Scooter?
- Please help me find the wizard.

164
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:43,366
Well Dorothy,
l've got your wizard right here.

165
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,273
That's enough, Billy!

166
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,838
Didn't you hear her,
she's a princess.

167
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,752
You mean, like from Disneyland?

168
00:24:54,887 --> 00:24:56,081
Now look what you did.

169
00:24:56,188 --> 00:25:00,215
l finally found a girl
and what do you do...

170
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,126
Ass.

171
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:28,320
Ya'll with that civil
war re-enactment?

172
00:25:33,993 --> 00:25:40,159
Sit well, human,
tonight we kill a wizard.

173
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,310
Well?

174
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:05,347
Well what?

175
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:08,391
Well where's the wood, Scooter?

176
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:10,686
Screw you, Leeroy!

177
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:13,131
What did you say to me?

178
00:26:17,236 --> 00:26:20,296
Don't you ever,
ever, talk to me like that!

179
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:22,203
Don't you ever,

180
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:27,809
Billy?

181
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,309
Billy, where's the wood?

182
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,316
Billy?

183
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:15,991
Gorejaw was wrong.

184
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:19,196
This is a very weak wizard.

185
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:26,171
Now where is the girl?

186
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,795
What? What girl?

187
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,034
No!

188
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:42,479
Same question, gut-sack. The girl.

189
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:45,317
l'll never tell you.

190
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,555
Only pull out half of his intestines.

191
00:27:57,703 --> 00:28:01,161
l could smell your fell orc-stench
from a league away, gudgeon.

192
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,233
Get her!

193
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,197
John Norton!
John Norton, are you in there?

194
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:39,474
John Norton, they found me!
Please! Please!

195
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:42,639
Look, l already told you.
You're trespassing.

196
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:45,246
- No!
- You're going to have to leave.

197
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,317
John Norton, please.

198
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:51,378
Looks like there's no more wizards
to run to tonight, princess.

199
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:55,584
John Norton.
John Norton. Please, please.

200
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:59,664
Please. Please let me in.
Please, please.

201
00:29:05,437 --> 00:29:07,632
You three, watch the house!

202
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:10,238
The rest, follow me!

203
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:37,793
His throat's been slit.

204
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:42,197
Spread out!

205
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,356
l think l heard a wizard.

206
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:12,299
How many wizards are there
in this damned world?

207
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,899
Stay here.

208
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:02,878
There, there. Sleep, princess.

209
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,355
Sleep. We have a long...

210
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:30,415
Aleya. Take this, take it.
l'll be back.

211
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,419
All your orc buddies are dead.

212
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,156
lf you set foot on my property again,

213
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,285
l'll hunt each and every one
of you down and kill you,

214
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,527
slowly if l get the chance.

215
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,757
l wouldn't be so hasty, Wizard.

216
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,342
Aleya? Aleya?!

217
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,275
Oh, Aleya? Come on, up, up.

218
00:32:45,457 --> 00:32:47,584
- Whitefeather!
- Norton?

219
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,121
There's something wrong with the girl.

220
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:58,803
l know this girl, her name is Aleya.

221
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,297
l served her father, Lord Darkton
in the Sorn-Drake Siege.

222
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:04,301
What's wrong with her?

223
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:05,910
She's been poisoned.

224
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:14,985
Tell me, what do you know
of the man you bought the farm from?

225
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:22,222
Um, only his name, Richard Conrad.

226
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,052
Across the nine realms,

227
00:33:25,197 --> 00:33:27,665
Conrad was known
as the Worldgate Sentinel.

228
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:30,562
The Wizard of Edenock.

229
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,104
That's what the other worlds
call this one.

230
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,802
They thought him a wizard
because this is the only world...

231
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:39,501
with advanced technology.

232
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:44,338
They could describe his weapons
in no other way than magic.

233
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,454
One night, when l was a boy,

234
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:55,716
the orcs came to our home
and slaughtered my family.

235
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:58,656
Richard Conrad came upon them...

236
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:01,561
as they took me back to the cave,
and killed them.

237
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:07,167
But not before they put out my eyes.

238
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:15,335
Richard Conrad took My Grandfather's
place as Worldgate Sentinel.

239
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,381
Just as you
have now taken Conrad's place.

240
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:26,423
My whole life, people have come to me
for protection...

241
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:33,196
Looking for me to be
some kind of a hero.

242
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,861
But it always ends the same way.

243
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:44,841
With their blood on my hands.

244
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:52,312
But you have been called here.

245
00:34:52,984 --> 00:34:57,114
Because you are the only one, right now,
who can fight this fight.

246
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,382
l'm no Guardian.

247
00:35:01,993 --> 00:35:03,756
l will look after her tonight.

248
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:08,733
You go home. Tomorrow is a new day.

249
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:13,804
Just one last question.

250
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,272
What do the orcs want with the girl?

251
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:21,538
That, l do not know.

252
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:56,737
l'm missing an orc.

253
00:38:01,306 --> 00:38:03,001
Dammit.

254
00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:12,282
At last!

255
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:42,445
Do not fail me again.

256
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:46,379
Attack!

257
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:34,189
What did you do to that girl?

258
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:40,260
l can smell your true self now, wizard...

259
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,438
Fear.

260
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:45,435
You are weakness.

261
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:50,273
Why Orc-Kind fear your magic,
l do not...

262
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:52,644
How about that magic?

263
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:55,478
Weakness.

264
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:00,515
Do l need to repeat the question?

265
00:40:02,427 --> 00:40:03,985
lt was Grolock.

266
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:10,725
She sleeps, nothing more.

267
00:40:24,115 --> 00:40:25,844
How many more
of you are out there in my woods?

268
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:33,213
Only we few scouts.
But soon, many hordes.

269
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:39,661
Then we will feed on your fear,
and on your pain.

270
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:44,235
We will cleave your marrow
and bathe in your blood.

271
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:55,475
Keep your answers to the point.

272
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,150
Why are you after the girl?
What is she to you?

273
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:08,351
You make jest of me?

274
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:12,327
Damnation!

275
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:14,264
You were saying?

276
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,500
The princess is the last
of the Havenock Elven bloodline;

277
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,202
creatures of high magic,

278
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:25,936
who were sacrificed
to the Dragon-born Gods

279
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:29,342
by the Undead Sisters
of Wurgisnacht.

280
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:32,950
With the blood of this last elf,

281
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:36,451
the Worldgates will once again
be opened forever more,

282
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:41,386
and the nine worlds will be ripe
for conquest and plunder.

283
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:49,362
Soon, my brothers will be here,
and they will come in force.

284
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,226
And after they have fed on your face,

285
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:56,899
they will find the girl
and they will strip her naked...

286
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:01,307
and carve her flesh
with gullies of blood.

287
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:05,674
Then they will cut the skin
from her feet...

288
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:08,752
and stand her on a crown of daggers,

289
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:14,984
until every drop of her precious blood
is drained from her body.

290
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,555
The hell they will.

291
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:27,666
They are already here.

292
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,146
Good talk.

293
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:54,592
Whitefeather?

294
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:14,107
What do you see?

295
00:43:25,797 --> 00:43:27,128
l see one.

296
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:30,325
The gun.

297
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:56,182
Point this end toward the orc,
then pull that lever.

298
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,323
l am quit of fleeing.

299
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,568
Come taste the flavor
or your death, beasts!

300
00:44:52,884 --> 00:44:54,749
Hurry! This way!

301
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:00,153
Get to Norton's house.
l will hold them here.

302
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:02,123
- No, Whitefeather. Wait!
- Go!

303
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:53,304
There will be enough blood
for the sacrifice if we feather her here.

304
00:45:57,448 --> 00:45:59,109
Fire!

305
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:09,893
Hang on!

306
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:16,464
After her!

307
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:19,368
What happened to Whitefeather?

308
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:27,211
Here!

309
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:31,243
Just keep this pressed down,
right there.

310
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:32,976
- Right there.
- John Norton!

311
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:34,847
- This is a very bad idea!
- Take it!

312
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,349
- John Norton!
- Just do it!

313
00:46:51,402 --> 00:46:53,302
- Faster!
- l'm trying!

314
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:38,976
Stay close.

315
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:47,219
Aw, hell.

316
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:54,926
What?

317
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,327
My orc got away.

318
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:02,770
Take this.

319
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:04,396
Wait.

320
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:07,403
Lets go.

321
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:24,254
Alright, you unpleasant
smelling bastards,

322
00:48:24,328 --> 00:48:26,353
just come a little bit closer.

323
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:45,977
What was that?

324
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:49,783
Go!

325
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,677
This isn't really magic, is it?

326
00:49:21,285 --> 00:49:23,480
l'll have your head on a pike!

327
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:27,990
l'll have your heart
for dinner, wizard!

328
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,736
Anytime, you son of a bitch.

329
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:54,243
So how long do we have before
that cave opens again?

330
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,584
The Worldgates between
Edenock and Nemis...

331
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:59,588
only opens when the mirror moons
are closest in their skies.

332
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:04,294
You'd think,
with it being astronomical,

333
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,055
it could be calculated somehow.

334
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,130
lt is the work of the wizards.

335
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:16,269
That term seems to be getting
kicked around pretty easily lately,

336
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,937
maybe there's not all
that much to it.

337
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:26,146
John Norton.

338
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:34,518
Thank you for keeping me safe.

339
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,226
Forget it.

340
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:44,196
lt is said that the Sentinel
is not only a great warrior,

341
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:47,363
but also a great protector.

342
00:50:53,644 --> 00:50:58,240
Those in need often gravitate
to them for safety...

343
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:01,246
even before they are the Sentinel.

344
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:04,287
Well, you're not safe yet.

345
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:10,752
This is your destiny, John Norton.

346
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:13,260
There is no doubt.

347
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:34,711
- May we come in?
- Whitefeather!

348
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:36,081
You live?

349
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:38,678
l think we have a respite
from the onslaught,

350
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,914
for the time being.

351
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:43,693
Who are you?

352
00:51:44,562 --> 00:51:47,360
- Scooter.
- l found him in the woods.

353
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:50,357
He was... crying.

354
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,831
What are these things?

355
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,268
- They're orcs.
- Orcs?!

356
00:52:06,984 --> 00:52:08,679
No need to say anything,

357
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:12,185
l already know
l'm damn good looking.

358
00:52:15,326 --> 00:52:16,918
lndeed you are.

359
00:52:17,828 --> 00:52:20,456
Ok, ok, l got an idea. Let's run.

360
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:23,428
We gotta get out of here!
We can go somewhere safe,

361
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:26,800
somewhere they'll never find us,
like New Mexico.

362
00:52:28,305 --> 00:52:30,102
We're not running.

363
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:33,608
We could drive.
Leeroy's dead now,

364
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:35,235
l could probably borrow his truck.

365
00:52:35,446 --> 00:52:38,210
Look, go if you want.
But this stops here.

366
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,311
All l wanted was to be left alone.

367
00:52:41,986 --> 00:52:46,320
To have a place of my own,
a sanctuary, but no.

368
00:52:46,423 --> 00:52:48,414
They brought their war here,
to my home.

369
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,290
So when they come,
l'm going to be ready for them.

370
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:57,193
But how will we know
when they come back?

371
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,001
Wait here.

372
00:53:13,884 --> 00:53:17,183
Hey, uh, do you need any help?

373
00:53:19,456 --> 00:53:21,321
Yes l do.

374
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:45,448
Speak.

375
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:50,885
Your highness, the preparations
are progressing as planned.

376
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:54,783
More clans are arriving every hour.

377
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:57,157
Excellent.

378
00:53:57,461 --> 00:54:01,591
We loathe to ask, Excellency,

379
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:07,638
but when will the other Sisters
of Wurgisnacht be arriving?

380
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,470
My sisters are gone,

381
00:54:12,576 --> 00:54:17,513
murdered by the Aynherjor
on their long journey.

382
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:23,979
l am the last of the Wurgisnacht.

383
00:54:40,237 --> 00:54:45,470
Looks like we're pretty much clear,
as far as l can see.

384
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:49,511
The stars are so different here.

385
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:51,805
Really?

386
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,442
Edenock is a strange place.

387
00:54:57,221 --> 00:55:00,122
l don't know. l kinda like it.

388
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:07,855
lt's a very noble place.

389
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:20,008
Norton was right,
this isn't your fight.

390
00:55:21,078 --> 00:55:23,512
Why don't you go, and be safe?

391
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,742
Maybe it is my fight.

392
00:55:28,118 --> 00:55:30,177
Seems to me
that if someone's in danger,

393
00:55:30,321 --> 00:55:33,950
it wouldn't be right to just
walk away and leave them.

394
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:40,356
Especially when a beautiful
princess is what's in danger.

395
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:44,058
l'm coming in.

396
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:49,365
- l see you. Come on in.
- Norton is here?

397
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,214
l think everything's set.

398
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,984
Ok. You know what to do.

399
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:05,053
lf everyone keeps their head
and does their part,

400
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:06,555
we've got a chance.

401
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:08,721
When we attack this tree line,
right here,

402
00:56:08,826 --> 00:56:10,123
we have to keep them off balance,

403
00:56:10,194 --> 00:56:12,355
confused and divided
with some shock and awe.

404
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:16,054
lf they get any opportunity
to attack us all at once,

405
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,992
we're dead meat.

406
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:21,067
l just wish we had something bigger,

407
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:23,206
something that could handle
larger numbers.

408
00:56:24,108 --> 00:56:26,201
Any estimate on how many orcs
we may be facing?

409
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,336
One can pass many troops through
a Worldgate in 23 minutes.

410
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,544
And there is no shortage
of orcs in Nemis.

411
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,481
Well, after tomorrow there will be.

412
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:40,789
You speak like a man who has embraced
his destiny, John Norton.

413
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:43,321
This is a good omen.

414
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:52,232
To be completely honest,

415
00:56:52,736 --> 00:56:55,296
l'm not 100%
sure all of this is real.

416
00:56:57,608 --> 00:57:01,066
l keep thinking maybe l'm in some VA
hospital somewhere in a coma,

417
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:03,246
and all this is just a dream.

418
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:07,649
Or maybe l didn't make it back
from the war.

419
00:57:09,386 --> 00:57:11,286
Maybe l'm really dead,

420
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:15,586
and this is my Hell.

421
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:20,359
Unfortunately, John Norton,

422
00:57:21,498 --> 00:57:23,625
l am not qualified
to tell you otherwise.

423
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:26,199
Hey, who's Jenny?

424
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,597
What's juggernaut?

425
00:57:32,876 --> 00:57:34,275
Let me see that.

426
00:57:39,817 --> 00:57:41,307
l'll be back.

427
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,642
Ready!

428
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:50,917
Destroy them!

429
00:59:41,471 --> 00:59:43,302
Rawhead!

430
01:00:41,598 --> 01:00:44,624
lt's the elf! She's at the cottage.

431
01:00:45,702 --> 01:00:47,294
Catapult!

432
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:54,333
Load!

433
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:10,215
Ready!

434
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:42,189
John, are you in there?
lt's Katie.

435
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:45,328
l was just in the neighborhood
and l figured l'd swing by and...

436
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:47,727
see how you were enjoying
your new house.

437
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,258
John?

438
01:01:53,303 --> 01:01:54,998
Fire!

439
01:02:02,779 --> 01:02:04,144
What the...

440
01:02:14,658 --> 01:02:16,558
Reload!

441
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:31,840
Ready!

442
01:03:31,301 --> 01:03:33,565
Archers! Fill him!

443
01:03:55,392 --> 01:03:58,190
You'll not survive this, man worm!

444
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:00,161
l will eat your...

445
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:07,266
Find the wizard. Find the...

446
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:21,549
You chose a poor time to visit,

447
01:04:22,285 --> 01:04:24,116
but l'm glad to have you.

448
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:25,754
You kidding me?

449
01:04:26,122 --> 01:04:28,147
Those bastards blew up my car.

450
01:04:28,725 --> 01:04:31,956
Forget the wizard.
We're here for the princess.

451
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:34,763
Go! Attack!

452
01:05:39,396 --> 01:05:42,263
Fall back. lt's Jenny's turn.

453
01:06:02,152 --> 01:06:03,710
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

454
01:06:06,323 --> 01:06:07,984
Shock and awe.

455
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:22,698
Ok, straight.

456
01:06:23,506 --> 01:06:25,838
Straight on, straight. Right.

457
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:29,203
l mean left! Ok right.

458
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:36,079
Go right. Right. Good, good. Left.

459
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:40,617
Ok. Here we go.

460
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,241
Fire!

461
01:07:14,391 --> 01:07:15,756
What was that?

462
01:07:16,259 --> 01:07:17,726
Some sort of thing.

463
01:07:18,328 --> 01:07:19,590
What sort of thing?

464
01:07:20,363 --> 01:07:22,923
Like a launchy, flipper-thing

465
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:30,596
You guys want some company?

466
01:07:31,274 --> 01:07:32,901
Free to land, free to land.

467
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:34,203
Come on in, we need help.

468
01:07:57,967 --> 01:08:01,459
Yeah! To answer your question,
Whitefeather,

469
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:05,370
that 'Thing' is a blowed up
pile of nothing now.

470
01:08:26,596 --> 01:08:28,723
Come back here, cowards!

471
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:30,230
l'll kill you myself!

472
01:08:45,949 --> 01:08:48,076
Keep her steady, Whitefeather!

473
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:38,667
Enough! Overrun it!

474
01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:41,837
Flip it over and slice open its belly!

475
01:09:49,345 --> 01:09:51,404
Go! Attack!

476
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:58,047
Aleya, the orcs are getting too close,
fall back!

477
01:09:58,121 --> 01:10:00,521
- l am safe where we are.
- Just do it!

478
01:10:11,968 --> 01:10:14,061
Gun it, Whitefeather! Gun it!

479
01:10:41,598 --> 01:10:44,192
l am the great wizard now.

480
01:10:45,268 --> 01:10:48,795
You messed
with the wrong bitch, bitch.

481
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:54,271
Go! Go, run, run!

482
01:11:17,834 --> 01:11:21,463
Call on our god.
Let the almighty Bokkvir...

483
01:11:21,604 --> 01:11:26,439
come forth in his fury and lay waste
to these pink milk-suckers once and for all.

484
01:11:35,151 --> 01:11:36,243
Hold up, Whitefeather.

485
01:11:43,626 --> 01:11:46,720
Aw, he's here.

486
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:50,360
Bokkvir. Bokkvir. Bokkvir.

487
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,826
Bokkvir. Bokkvir. Bokkvir.

488
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,868
Bokkvir. Bokkvir. Bokkvir.

489
01:11:57,106 --> 01:12:00,007
Bokkvir. Bokkvir. Bokkvir.

490
01:12:00,143 --> 01:12:02,873
- Bokkvir. Bokkvir...
- Norton,

491
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:05,311
- Bokkvir...
- ...what's a Bokkvir?

492
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,342
l'm not sure.

493
01:12:10,353 --> 01:12:12,253
l don't like how it sounds.

494
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:17,225
Bokkvir! Bokkvir! Bokkvir!...

495
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:41,844
To Nemis with us, girl.

496
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:45,649
The spilling of your blood
is long overdue.

497
01:13:09,278 --> 01:13:10,506
What was that?

498
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,048
Something worse than orcs.

499
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:19,585
Bokkvir! Bokkvir! Bokkvir!...

500
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:23,953
Whitefeather?

501
01:13:24,327 --> 01:13:26,158
Did you know
that dragons were real?

502
01:13:26,662 --> 01:13:27,788
Yes.

503
01:13:27,897 --> 01:13:29,262
Dragons are real?!

504
01:13:30,566 --> 01:13:33,262
- Are they mean?
- Go, go, go!

505
01:13:36,606 --> 01:13:39,769
l wont let you get the princess,
you bastard!

506
01:13:48,317 --> 01:13:49,875
Whitefeather, hard left, now!

507
01:14:25,988 --> 01:14:28,889
Woo hoo! At a baby, Norton!

508
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:33,193
Stop, stop, stop!

509
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:56,082
Get out of the half-track, now!

510
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:22,436
Scooter! Whitefeather!

511
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:34,286
Aleya! Get out of the house!

512
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,349
Get out of the house now.
Do you copy?

513
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:39,622
Aleya!

514
01:16:08,724 --> 01:16:10,589
Aleya, get out of the house, now!

515
01:16:52,835 --> 01:16:55,360
Come on, Norton. Time to move.

516
01:16:58,741 --> 01:17:03,474
l failed again, like always.

517
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,270
But, you're the Sentinel.

518
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:11,343
Am l?

519
01:17:13,322 --> 01:17:15,347
l don't know. You tell me.

520
01:17:54,497 --> 01:17:57,523
Yes, you've taken care
of the pathetic wizard,

521
01:17:57,667 --> 01:17:59,328
but what of the girl?

522
01:18:00,169 --> 01:18:03,263
That's right, l have her.

523
01:18:09,278 --> 01:18:12,736
Fangmark, you live?

524
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:17,714
l live, and l surpass you, Gorejaw.

525
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:22,414
Now who dares oppose me?

526
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:29,222
We return to Nemis.
We have a sacrifice to deliver.

527
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:18,940
At last.

528
01:19:20,082 --> 01:19:25,543
No! l am wizard, now!

529
01:19:27,857 --> 01:19:30,189
There will be no sacrifice,

530
01:19:30,259 --> 01:19:34,855
until you release my clan
from your servitude.

531
01:19:36,098 --> 01:19:38,464
...no longer will we be...

532
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:55,180
And now, the Final Sacrifice.

533
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:27,207
Wizard.

534
01:20:27,283 --> 01:20:28,750
No.

535
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:32,546
But until he gets here,
you will have me to deal with.

536
01:20:45,701 --> 01:20:47,328
Pitiful.

537
01:21:53,769 --> 01:21:55,794
Kill him.

538
01:22:20,396 --> 01:22:21,522
Whitefeather!

539
01:22:47,122 --> 01:22:49,420
l will leave with the girl,

540
01:22:51,026 --> 01:22:53,961
or with a glut of orc blood
on my blade.

541
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:01,834
No.

542
01:23:28,897 --> 01:23:30,364
No.

543
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,516
That's right.

544
01:24:56,552 --> 01:24:58,520

545
01:25:26,482 --> 01:25:29,508
And you must be one
of the Sisters of Wurgisnacht.

546
01:25:42,564 --> 01:25:44,191
John Norton.

547
01:25:50,539 --> 01:25:52,302
This is your world, huh?

548
01:25:54,676 --> 01:25:55,836

01:27:56,898 --> 01:27:59,958
Another time, Wizard.

551
01:28:00,569 --> 01:28:02,366
You know where to find me, Orc.

552
01:28:31,366 --> 01:28:33,266
They will be long remembered.

553
01:28:35,704 --> 01:28:37,433

01:28:38,006 --> 01:28:39,473

01:28:48,984 --> 01:28:50,508
Yeah.

557
01:28:59,528 --> 01:29:01,257
lt is beautiful.

558
01:29:05,634 --> 01:29:08,899
And to think,

559
01:29:14,843 --> 01:29:16,242

560
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:31,952

561
