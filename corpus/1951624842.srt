1
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:39,572
<i>After weeks of campaigning on the road...</i>

2
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:43,209
<i>Tony Blair and his family, 
finally strolled the few hundred yards </i>

3
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,226
<i>to the polling station, 
this election day morning.</i>

4
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,721
<i>Amongst the Labour faithful
up and down the country...</i>

5
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,686
<i>there is an enormous sense
of pride in Mr. Blair's achievements.</i>

6
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,411
<i>And the confidence
that he is about to become</i>

7
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:56,636
the youngest Prime Minister
this century.

8
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:58,344
Have you voted yet,
Mr. Crawford?

9
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,136
Yes, Ma'am...

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,310
I was there when they opened,
first in line, at 7 o'clock...

11
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,633
I don't mind telling you...
It wasn't for Mr. Blair.

12
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,457
- Your not a moderniser then?
- Certainly not...

13
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,690
We're in danger of losing too much,
that is good about this country, as it is.

14
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:18,332
<i>There is a growing sense
of excitement...</i>

15
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,721
I envy you,
being able to vote.

16
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,487
Not the actually
ticking of the box, although...

17
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:29,253
it would be nice
to experience that once.

18
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,042
But the sheer joy of being partial.

19
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,134
Yes...

20
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:38,999
Of course one forgets that as Sovereign,
you're not entitled to vote.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,145
No...

22
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:43,504
Still, you won't catch me
feeling sorry for you.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,633
You might not
be allowed to vote, Ma'am...

24
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,613
but it is your government.

25
00:01:52,282 --> 00:01:53,251
Yes...

26
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:57,013
I suppose that is some consolation.

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,351
Good morning.

28
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,557
- Shall I draw the curtains.
- Yes...

29
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,850
- So, did you stay up all night?
- Yes, Ma'am.

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,144
- And was it as expected?
- Yes, Ma'am.

31
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,504
- Mr. Blair.
- By a landslide.

32
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:18,936
Oh, I see...

33
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,753
<i>They've stopped the traffic, completely...</i>

34
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,640
<i>For Tony Blair's first
day of power, in London.</i>

35
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,285
<i>You got the ceremonial
with tourists, the official...</i>

36
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:32,929
<i>and you got
a lovely summer's day...</i>

37
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,512
<i>Tony Blair waving to the crowds,
people waving to them there...</i>

38
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:38,095
<i>I guess most of them
do know it's the...</i>

39
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,978
<i>the Prime Minister waiting...
Lining in the streets there.</i>

40
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,283
The Prime Minister
is on his way, Ma'am.

41
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:50,423
To be, Robin..
The Prime Minister to be...

42
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,744
I haven't asked him yet.

43
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,691
He's a hard one to read,
isn't he?

44
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,462
Yes... On the one hand his
background is quite establishment...

45
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:03,525
father a conservative,
educated at Fettis. Where he was

46
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:06,394
tutored by the same
man as the Prince of Wales.

47
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,202
Well, we'll try not
to hold that against him.

48
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:12,603
On the other, his manifesto promises
the most radical modernisation...

49
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:15,591
and shake up of the
constitution in 300 years.

50
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:17,939
Oh, you mean he is
going to try and modernise us?

51
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,386
I wouldn't let it past him...

52
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:22,767
he's married to a woman with known
anti-monarchist sympathies...

53
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,579
you may remember her curtsy,
the first time you met.

54
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,391
It could best
be described as.. shallow.

55
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:34,010
I don't measure the depth of a
curtsy, Robin. I leave that to my sister.

56
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:37,410
The atmosphere at Downing Street
is expected to very informal...

57
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,468
Everyone on first name terms...

58
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,364
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

59
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:44,358
- What, as in call me Tony?
- Yes, Ma'am.

60
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,229
Oh, I don't like that.

61
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,925
Could we send him a protocol sheet?

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,549
Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

63
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,302
Why? You've met her
often enough before.

64
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,019
I know, but..
never one to one...

65
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,145
and never as Prime Minister.

66
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:10,633
Well, just remember..  you're a man
that's just been elected by
the whole nation.

67
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:13,384
But she's still...

68
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:16,088
you know.. The Queen.

69
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,997
When we reach the
audience room...

70
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:32,437
I will knock.
We will not wait to be called..
we shall go straight inside.

71
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:35,549
Standing by the door,
we bow.. from the neck...

72
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,322
I will introduce you...

73
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:39,514
The Queen will extend her hand..
you go to her...

74
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:42,625
bow again..
then shake her hand.

75
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:45,533
A couple of other things...

76
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,374
It's Ma'am as in ham...

77
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,653
not mam as in farm.

78
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,924
And when you're in the presence...

79
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,157
at no point must you
show your back.

80
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:57,446
- The presence?
- Yes, sir...

81
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:00,881
That's what it is called, when you're
in Her Majesty's company.

82
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,310
Would you like
to sit down, Mrs. Blair?

83
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,198
How nice to see you
again, Mr. Blair.

84
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,401
And congratulations.

85
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,468
The children must be very proud?

86
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,921
- I hope so.
- You have three, haven't you?

87
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:34,496
- That's right.
- Oh, how lovely.

88
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,149
Such a blessing.. children.

89
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,366
Please, do sit down.

90
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,683
Thank you.

91
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,784
Have they shown you how to
start a nuclear war, yet?

92
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,801
Ah, no...

93
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,318
Oh, first thing we do.
Apparently...

94
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:59,906
Then we take away your passport,
and spend the rest of the time
sending you around the world.

95
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:02,567
You obviously know my job,
better than I do...

96
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,433
Well you are my 10th
Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.

97
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,143
My first, of course,
was Winston Churchill

98
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,369
he sat in your chair...
in a front coat...

99
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,300
and top hat.

100
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:16,483
He was kind enough to give,
a shy young girl like me,
quite an education.

101
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:17,545
I can imagine...

102
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:22,857
With time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education.
And a little wisdom...

103
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:26,533
better enabling us to execute
our constitutional responsibility.

104
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:31,220
To advise, guide, and warn
the government of the day.

105
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,757
Advise which I...

106
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,694
look forward to receiving.

107
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,176
Yes, we'll save that for
our weekly meetings.

108
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,606
If there's nothing else, I believe we
have some business to attend to.

109
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:45,982
Of course...

110
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:51,030
Your Majesty, my party has
won the election...

111
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,368
so I come now to ask your
permission to form a govern...

112
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,655
No, Mr. Blair.
Mr. Blair, I ask the question.

113
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:01,456
The duty falls upon me
as your Sovereign

114
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,479
to invite you
to become Prime Minister...

115
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,007
and to form a
government in my name.

116
00:08:07,892 --> 00:08:10,572
And if you agree,
the custom is to say yes...

117
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:13,058
Yes...

118
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,454
Mrs. Blair...
Lovely to see you again.

119
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:40,715
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

120
00:08:40,716 --> 00:08:42,669
- Yes...
- And exhausted, I imagine...

121
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,415
Where will you be spending
the summer?

122
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,149
- France.
- Oh, lovely.

123
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,534
- You'll be at Balmoral, right?
- Yes, I can't wait.
It's a wonderful place.

124
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,493
You know my great great
grandmother Victoria said of it...

125
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,521
in Balmoral all seems to breed...

126
00:08:55,555 --> 00:08:58,404
freedom and peace and make one
forget the world and its sad turmoils.

127
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:01,206
Oh, excuse me.

128
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:09,737
Oh, yes of course...

129
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,331
I'm so sorry, we're going to
have to leave it there.

130
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:28,728
- Not to short was it?
15 minutes...

131
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,444
One doesn't want to be rude.

132
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,445
- No, no.

133
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:38,604
- Thank you very much
for coming, now fuck off!

134
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,289
- I know,
what was all that about?

135
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,280
God knows... Diana.
Whatever it is it will be
something to do with Diana.

136
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,221
<i>Princess Diana embroiled
in more controversy</i>

137
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,732
<i>as she pulls out
of a meeting with MP's...</i>

138
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,418
<i>Princess Diana moved today
to patch up</i>

139
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,718
<i>her relations with
the former royal nanny...</i>

140
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,872
<i>Princess Diana flew to Milan today
for the memorial service</i>

141
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:58,024
<i>for the murdered
Italian fashion designer...</i>

142
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,444
<i>Gianni Versace.</i>

143
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:02,682
<i>Where tonight, another royal
controversy sparkles...</i>

144
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:06,176
<i>after finding herself embroiled
in her second controversy this week...</i>

145
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,747
<i>I am not a political figure...</i>

146
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:12,247
<i>Princess Diana sailed out
into the Mediterranean...</i>

147
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,717
<i>in one of Mr. Mohamed
al-Fayed's yachts today...</i>

148
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:16,582
<i>with his son.</i>

149
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:19,202
<i>A quarter of a
million pounds, for photographs</i>

150
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:21,008
<i>which appear
to show the couple embracing...</i>

151
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:26,084
<i>Once again,
her judgement's under scrutiny...</i>

152
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,854
Robin Janvrin.

153
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,102
What?

154
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,698
I want everyone in, ASAP.

155
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:52,990
Ma'am?

156
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:54,815
Ma'am?

157
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:00,378
Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin
is here to see you.

158
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,545
What?

159
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,788
Good evening, Ma'am.

160
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:17,785
I'm sorry to disturb. But I just
had a call from our Embassy in Paris.

161
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,648
- It's The Princess of Wales.
- Why?

162
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,186
What's she done now?

163
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:25,615
I see, em...

164
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,502
Who are we speaking to then?

165
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:30,859
Right, well keep me updated.

166
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:36,626
It's Diana, she's been in
a car accident in Paris.

167
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,992
Is it serious?

168
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,608
Apparently.. Dodi Fayed is dead.

169
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:45,949
<i>Let's just recap on the
details of those injuries, Maxine.</i>

170
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,562
<i>Yes Nick, what they're saying is...</i>

171
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:52,066
<i>that the Princess is in the intensive
care unit of a south-east Paris hospital.</i>

172
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:54,716
<i>She has a concussion,
a broken arm, and...</i>

173
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:57,678
What was she doing in Paris? I thought
she was supposed to be in London.

174
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,460
Oh, you know what she's like.

175
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:05,152
Charles, isn't this awful?

176
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,613
What are you
going to do about the boys?

177
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,637
Let them sleep until we know more.

178
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:11,864
Yes, that's sensible.

179
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,140
I should go to Paris. I told
my people to start organising a jet.

180
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:18,988
- What, a private one?
- Yes...

181
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:22,831
Isn't that precisely the sort of
extravagance they always attack us for?

182
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:24,596
How else am I supposed to
get to Paris at this time of night?

183
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,361
The airport at Aberdeen
will be closed.

184
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,292
Charles...

185
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:33,316
Use the royal flight. They keep one
plane on permanent standby...

186
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:34,858
in case I should kick the bucket.

187
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,953
No mummy! That's out of the question.
This isn't a matter of state.

188
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:42,610
- What are you talking about?
- Diana is no longer a member
of the royal family.

189
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,460
She's not a HRH.
This is a private matter.

190
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,995
She's mother to your grandchildren.

191
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,399
- What is happening now?
- I don't know... I can't hear...

192
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,627
everyone's shouting.

193
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:00,752
Thank's for coming in.

194
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,362
The Ambassador,
from Paris.

195
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,418
Good evening, sir.

196
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,406
Yes?

197
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,412
I have just spoken to
our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am...

198
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,292
I'm afraid it's not good news...

199
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:31,671
No!

200
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:34,887
No, no, no...

201
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,036
<i>Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died, after a car crash in Paris.</i>

202
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,714
<i>The french government
announced her death</i>

203
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,392
<i>just before
5 o'clock this morning.</i>

204
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:55,133
What have I got on this week?

205
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,947
You're writing your maiden
conference speeches, Prime Minister.

206
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:00,608
Well, let's cancel everything else.

207
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,122
This is going to be massive...

208
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,679
I'd better make a statement
in the morning.

209
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,513
Well, you'll be pleased to know I've
already started coming up with ideas.

210
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:15,285
God, she's only been dead an hour...

211
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,372
Well, would you prefer
I didn't do my job?

212
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,455
They're going go to
go back to sleep.

213
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,489
Try anyway...

214
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:03,605
My private secretary's office
have found a travel agency

215
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,199
open in New York
that will...

216
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,745
sell me a flight to Paris, with
an hours stop over in Manchester.

217
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,545
Perhaps now you might
like to consider whether it's

218
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,874
still an extravagance
to bring back the mother...

219
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,152
of the future King of England...

220
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,213
In one of our planes?

221
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,250
Alright...

222
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,272
of course.

223
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:40,668
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset...

224
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,954
first thing in the morning,
I want the radio taken

225
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:45,240
out of the bedroom, and the
television taken out of the nursery.

226
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,024
Yes, Ma'am.

227
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,900
Well, well, well...

228
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,902
Yes.

229
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,034
Are you alright?

230
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,592
Your sister called.

231
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,179
From Tuscany.

232
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,420
Well, I hope you told her to
come back, cut her holiday short.

233
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,142
I did.

234
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:12,867
- I can't imagine she was pleased...
- That's putting it mildly.

235
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:16,086
- What did she say?
- Something about Diana managing...

236
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:18,396
to be even more annoying
dead than alive...

237
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,661
Just make sure you never let
the boys hear you talk like that.

238
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,056
Of course...

239
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,712
Something to help you go down.

240
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,388
No, I think I'll write
my diary a little longer.

241
00:18:33,494 --> 00:18:34,765
Fine.

242
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,220
I'm going to bed.

243
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:10,151
<i>We've heard nothing official from
the Palace yet, we still don't know</i>

244
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:13,019
<i>when we're gonna get any further
statements from inside the Palace..</i>

245
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,150
<i>or of course when the royal
family are due back.</i>

246
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:20,635
That's how she will remain,
in our minds, our hearts...

247
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:21,954
forever.

248
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,353
OK?
Got it!

249
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,373
<i>Where will you do it?</i>

250
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:28,082
We'll do it at the church.
On the way in.

251
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:29,855
Alright, I'll organise it.

252
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,132
Hang on...
I wanna watch this.

253
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:40,685
<i>This is not the time for
incriminations, but for sadness...</i>

254
00:19:40,686 --> 00:19:42,699
<i>however I would say
that I always believed</i>

255
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,712
<i>the press would
kill her in the end...</i>

256
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:46,937
<i>but not even I
could imagine they'll take</i>

257
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,161
<i>such a direct hand in her death...</i>

258
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:50,332
<i>as seems to be the case.</i>

259
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,715
<i>It would appear that every
proprieter and editor...</i>

260
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:56,149
<i>of every publication
that has payed for intrusive</i>

261
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,582
<i>and exploitative
photographs of her...</i>

262
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,348
<i>has blood on his hands today.</i>

263
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,553
Not the press, mate.
You got the wrong villain.

264
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:05,451
Tony...

265
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,928
got to go...

266
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,373
You about to speak
to The Queen?

267
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,644
- Yeah...
- Ask her if she greased the breaks.

268
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:13,527
Now, now...

269
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,660
Hello?

270
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,624
Right, okay...

271
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,773
Is The Prince of Wales
with the boys?

272
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,823
Yes, Ma'am

273
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,879
- And he's going to Paris?
- Yes...

274
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:45,551
I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am...
Ma'am...

275
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,661
but I have the Prime Minister for you,
from his constituency.

276
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:51,384
Lucky you..

277
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,265
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

278
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:08,120
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister.

279
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:11,073
May I say right away,
how very sorry I am...

280
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:13,586
and that the thoughts
and prayers of my family

281
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:15,283
are with you
at this terrible time.

282
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,984
And with the Princes,
in particular.

283
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:18,675
Thank you.

284
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,451
<i>Is it your intention to make
some kind of appearance?</i>

285
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:24,911
<i>Or statement?</i>

286
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:27,579
No, no!
Certainly not.

287
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,475
No member of the royal family
will speak publicly about this.

288
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:33,928
This is a private matter.

289
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,508
We would all appreciate it,
if it could be respected as such.

290
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,376
I see.

291
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,896
I don't suppose anyone has had
time to think about the funeral, yet?

292
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,874
We've spoken with the
Spencer family, and it is their wish...

293
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,755
it is their expressed wish,
that this should be a private funeral.

294
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,746
with a memorial service to follow,
in a month or so.

295
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:54,897
Right...

296
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,091
And given that Diana was
no longer a member of the royal family...

297
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,688
we have no other choice,
but to respect their wishes.

298
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,280
I see...

299
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:07,763
<i>you don't feel that in view
of her high profile popularity...</i>

300
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:12,931
it might be an idea to pay
tribute to her life and achievements?

301
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:17,040
Or even just to her as a mother?

302
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,491
Well, as I said,
it's her family's wish...

303
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:22,757
And the public, Ma'am?
The British people...

304
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:27,864
<i>you don't think a private funeral
might be denying them a chance...</i>

305
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:28,603
A chance to what?

306
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,633
<i>To share in the grief.</i>

307
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,561
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

308
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,231
I think The Princess has
already paid a high enough price...

309
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:42,112
for exposure to the press...

310
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:42,977
<i>don't you?</i>

311
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,819
Now, if there's nothing else,
I must get on.

312
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,503
The children have to be looked after.

313
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:50,562
Of course...
well, goodbye Your Majes...

314
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,028
Her instinct is to do nothing.

315
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,394
Say nothing.. and
give her a private funeral.

316
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:08,749
Are you surprised?

317
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,242
She hated her guts.

318
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:11,816
Well, I think it's a mistake...

319
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:16,019
They screwed up her life, let's
hope they don't screw up her death.

320
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,384
Where can I find a black tie?

321
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,577
Oh, the chaplain called.

322
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,117
He wanted to know,
whether we should make any

323
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:23,644
changes in the service..
any...

324
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,098
special mention of Diana.

325
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,788
What did you say?

326
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,578
Well, I told him
not to change a thing.

327
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,055
Quite right...

328
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:34,876
I think the less attention one
draws to it, the better.

329
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,186
- For the boys.
- Yes...

330
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,930
But I think maybe we should find
some company for them...

331
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,899
Some young people.

332
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,213
I'll take them for a long walk,
this afternoon.. up Craggie Head.

333
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:46,262
Yes, but no guns Phillip..
it is Sunday.

334
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:52,989
And we're going... in fact...
I believe...

335
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:55,794
to Sedgefield, the
Prime Minister's constituency...

336
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:58,220
where he is about
to make a statement...

337
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:03,794
yes the Prime Minister coming
now, with his wife Cherie...

338
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:08,689
He's on. Alastair, he's on.
Come on!

339
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:14,528
...as her own life was often,
sadly touched by tradegy...

340
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:19,346
she touched the lives,
of so many others in...

341
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,849
in Britain, throughout the world...

342
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:25,079
with joy...

343
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,096
and with comfort.

344
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,158
The people, everywhere...

345
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:33,646
not just here in Britain,
everywhere...

346
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,978
they kept faith,
with Princess Diana.

347
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,375
They liked her, they loved her...

348
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,163
they regarded her,
as one of the people...

349
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:48,511
she was the people's Princess.

350
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:55,550
And that's how she will stay...

351
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,170
how she will remain.

352
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,587
In our hearts...

353
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:01,497
and in our memories...

354
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:03,743
forever.

355
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:05,860
A little over the top,
don't you think?

356
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:12,130
<i>The people of Britain, he said...</i>

357
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,258
<i>kept faith with Princess Diana...</i>

358
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:19,478
<i>they loved her..
she was the people's Princess.</i>

359
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:30,925
- Did we remember the Royal Standard?
- Yes, Sir.

360
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,446
- And flowers?
- Yes, Sir.

361
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,556
Good, 'cause if we leave it
to the rural undertakers...

362
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:36,666
they'll bring her
back in a wooden crypt.

363
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:28,493
Hello?

364
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:30,786
<i>This is Lord Airlie, may I speak
with the Prime Minister, please?</i>

365
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:32,390
One moment, please.

366
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,874
Lord Airlie..
The Lord Chamberlain

367
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,357
in charge of the funeral..
you're meeting him at the airport.

368
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:40,159
Lord Airlie.

369
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:42,830
Good afternoon, Prime Minister,
it's my job to organise

370
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:45,055
all the ceremonial events.

371
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:49,297
There is simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

372
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,607
Perhaps we shall plan
for any contingency.

373
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,386
Yes, I propose a meeting
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning

374
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:56,165
at Buckingham Palace...

375
00:26:56,262 --> 00:26:59,136
<i>officals from all three Palaces,
representatives from the</i>

376
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:02,011
<i>Spencer family,
the emergency services...</i>

377
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,208
would you send some of your people?

378
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,656
Absolutely, of course.

379
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:13,611
Precedent!?
Where do they find these people?

380
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,189
Prime Minister...

381
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,892
I'm so sorry, Sir.
If there's anything I..

382
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,907
or my government, can do...

383
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:47,651
They stood up, as we drove past,
in cafés, in restaurants...

384
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:51,863
removed their hats, this was Paris,
one of the busiest cities in the world...

385
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:54,697
and you could hear a pin drop.
- I imagine it will be the same here.

386
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,686
The Palace would still prefer
to see this as a private funeral.

387
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,640
What are your feelings on that?

388
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:00,149
I...

389
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:06,188
I think that will present us
with difficulties.

390
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,047
So do I...

391
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:11,385
My mother, The Queen...

392
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:15,665
comes from a generation of best
equipped... she grew up in the war...

393
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:18,554
I think.. what we need..
what this country needs...

394
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,727
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow...

395
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:26,634
- Balmoral is...
- I think I understand...

396
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:33,812
<i>An aircraft of the Queen's flight...</i>

397
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,669
<i>brought The Princess'
body home this evening...</i>

398
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,619
<i>where the Prime Minister,
Tony Blair, had gathered with</i>

399
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,568
<i>members of his government.</i>

400
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,590
<i>A single black hearse crossed the tarmac...</i>

401
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:46,472
<i>and a Royal Air Force guard
of honour, moved slowly forward.</i>

402
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,467
Has anyone heard from
the Spencer's yet?

403
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,461
Have they made up their minds
when the funeral will be?

404
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:55,131
Well I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

405
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:58,635
<i>President Clinton was with his wife,
when he heard the news last night.</i>

406
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,729
<i>We liked her very much...</i>

407
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,936
<i>we admired her work for children...</i>

408
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:07,549
<i>for people with AIDS, for the cause
of ending the scour of landmines...</i>

409
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,638
On our walk today one of the
ghillies said he'd seen a large stag

410
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:12,127
up Craggie Head...

411
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:15,943
He reckoned, 14 pointer.

412
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,403
We haven't had one as big as
that on the estate, for years...

413
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:23,528
No, quite...

414
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:30,776
Anyway... I thought it might
be a good distraction...

415
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:32,438
for the boys.

416
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,670
What.. stalking?

417
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:36,901
You don't think that's
a bit soon, do you?

418
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,162
I think anything that gets
them outside, is a good idea.

419
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,696
<i>...she became an
increasingly unhappy figure.</i>

420
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:49,233
<i>The couple divorced
in August of last year.</i>

421
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:56,538
<i>It was the love story that
brought crowds into the streets...</i>

422
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,542
<i>they came to see The Queen,
of course, and The Prince...</i>

423
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:02,047
<i>but most of all,
they came to see Diana.</i>

424
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:04,629
I'm going to bed.

425
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,945
I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office.
Say we are going to send

426
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:30,581
representatives for the meeting
tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.

427
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:32,523
Thank you, Stephen.

428
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:46,679
She gave us so much.

429
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,607
Why couldn't we have
given her a little something...

430
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,533
and left her alone?

431
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,642
It just hurts me so much.

432
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,517
I've never experienced
anything like this. I can't...

433
00:30:57,518 --> 00:31:00,391
I keep waiting to
wake up, like it's a bad dream.

434
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:16,741
Right, it's 10 o'clock.
Let's get started, shall we?

435
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,809
And thank you all for coming,
at such short notice.

436
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:24,440
I think we all agree that this is
an extraordinarily sensitive occation...

437
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,024
which presents us
with tremendous challenges.

438
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,771
Modestically, constitutionally...

439
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:35,558
practically, diplomatically
and procedurally.

440
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,820
Christ...

441
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,553
After 18 years of opposition...

442
00:31:45,554 --> 00:31:47,717
I am proud to stand before you,
as the new Prime Minister

443
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:48,681
of our country...

444
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,346
Labour, Prime Minister.

445
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,023
I want to set an ambitious
course to modernise this country...

446
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:57,748
to breed new life
in to old institutions.

447
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:01,177
To make privileged something for
the many... not the few...

448
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:03,348
Flippin' heck...
You think the royals are nutters?

449
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,519
You should meet their flunkies...

450
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,018
Two and a half hours of
whether she should be carried

451
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:08,716
in a hearse or a gun carriage.

452
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:12,170
Anyway, you got raves in the press.

453
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,120
This lot calls you the
nation's mourner-in-chief

454
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,947
This lot says
you're the only person who's

455
00:32:15,948 --> 00:32:17,773
correctly judged,
the mood of the country.

456
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,853
Even The Mail is impressed.

457
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,463
The people's Princess, mate...
you owe me.

458
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:28,904
Gordon for you...

459
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,909
Tell him to hang on.

460
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:31,190
Alastair...

461
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,422
So they've come to their senses?
Is it going to be a public funeral?

462
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,579
Yeah, Saturday..
It's a whopper!

463
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,023
- The Abbey, the works...
- Great.

464
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:41,977
Has anyone told the queen yet?

465
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:44,288
I don't know. No doubt
some flunkey will be dispatched.

466
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:46,598
Grovelling on all fours.

467
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:59,040
Do you think it's wise for
the boys to go stalking so soon?

468
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,929
Anything that gets them into
the fresh air, is a good thing.

469
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,582
Maybe they shouldn't take their guns?
I mean, if a photographer

470
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:07,236
were to see them, it might send
out the wrong signal?

471
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:09,880
If there is
a photographer out there...

472
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:12,451
he could be
the first kill of the day.

473
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,640
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night...

474
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:22,619
At midnight.
No cameras, no fuss.

475
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,968
Very dignified.

476
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:28,325
Why do they do that?
Why do they bury their bodies

477
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:30,101
so soon after their death?

478
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:33,038
Islamic tradition...

479
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,962
something to do with the heat.

480
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,855
It stops the body decomposing

481
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,278
Yes, come in!

482
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:45,409
- Good morning, Ma'am... Ma'am.
- Yes, Robin...

483
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,540
what can we do for you?

484
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:52,408
Ma'am. There was a meeting at
the Palace, this morning...

485
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:54,544
About the funeral arrangements, yes...

486
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:59,007
The Lord Chamberlain faxed over
these plans for you to consider.

487
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:03,891
There is now
general agreement, Ma'am...

488
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:08,124
that a public funeral,
would be more appropriate.

489
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:13,749
I see...

490
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,490
And what form will this funeral take?

491
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:21,371
At the moment they're suggesting...

492
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,726
and of course, these are early days...

493
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:26,962
basing it on Taye Bridge.

494
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,210
- Taye Bridge?
- What?

495
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:33,244
But Taye Bridge is
to go down for my funeral.

496
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,618
Indeed, Ma'am.

497
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:38,350
But it would be
for practical reasons only...

498
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:42,713
it's the only one which
has been... rehearsed.

499
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:45,893
The only one that could be
put together, in time...

500
00:34:47,058 --> 00:34:50,249
But I supervised
those plans myself...

501
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:51,260
Indeed...

502
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,692
And the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

503
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:55,523
that the spirit of the occasion

504
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:57,903
will be quite different,
for example...

505
00:34:57,904 --> 00:35:01,111
the suggestion is that
instead of 400 soldiers...

506
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:06,189
400 representatives of the Princess'
various charitys march behind...

507
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,511
the coffin.

508
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:11,261
And instead of
foreign heads of state...

509
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:13,016
and crown heads
of Europe...

510
00:35:13,017 --> 00:35:14,750
the guests would include...

511
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:18,546
a sprinkling of actors
of stage and screen...

512
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:19,853
fashion designers...

513
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:24,583
and other... celebrities.
- Celebrities?

514
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,481
Was there anything else?

515
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:37,082
No, Ma'am.

516
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:41,482
Oh, yes,
one other thing...

517
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:45,331
the police commisioner was
keen that you consider...

518
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:47,986
the idea of a condolence book.

519
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,968
It would give the growing crowds

520
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:53,616
something to do..
make marshaling them easier.

521
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:54,839
Oh, yes,
yes of course...

522
00:35:56,766 --> 00:36:00,719
- Oh, and the flowers...
- What flowers?

523
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:04,161
The flowers outside
Buckingham Palace... At the moment

524
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,059
they're blocking the path
through the Main Gate..

525
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,561
and will make things difficult

526
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:10,312
for the changing of the guards.

527
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,260
Oh, fine.
Just move them away.

528
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:14,631
Actually, the
Lord Chamberlain was

529
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,888
wondering whether we
shouldn't leave the flowers...

530
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:19,718
and send the guards
through the North Gate

531
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:21,983
Oh, yes,
yes of course.

532
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:24,346
Yes,
that's quite right.

533
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,195
Stephen Lamport on one.

534
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,659
- Who?
- The Prince of Wales' private secretary.

535
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,920
- Balmoral.
- He says it's urgent.

536
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:47,568
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

537
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:50,881
The Prince of Wales has asked me
to thank you again

538
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:52,805
for your kind words yesterday.

539
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:53,839
Not at all.

540
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:57,619
The Prince feels that...
you and he...

541
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:02,223
are both modern men,
of similar mind...

542
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:05,896
who could work well together,
at this difficult time.

543
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:09,897
Ah, well..
please thank His Highness

544
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:12,778
and assure him
he can count on my full support.

545
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,908
At all times.

546
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,277
- Was that it?
- Yes...

547
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,388
Goodbye.

548
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,839
Bizzare.

549
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,301
- Why is Charles doing this?
- What?

550
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:35,981
Creeping up to me like this.

551
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:38,159
Banging on about being modern.

552
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,410
He did it at the airport, when he
asked me to deal with his mother.

553
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,838
Because he knows that if the Queen
continous to get it wrong over Diana...

554
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,058
then the royals become
public enemy number one.

555
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:50,156
And he's terrified of
being shot, apparently.

556
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,079
Who, Charles?

557
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,601
His people have already been on
to us.. to ask for extra protection.

558
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:56,142
He probably thinks that if
he seems to be on our side...

559
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:58,735
then that would leave
The Queen in the firing line.

560
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:01,993
What.. so it's okay for his mother
to take the bullet, and not him...

561
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,785
What a family!

562
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,759
- Wait, where are they?
- They're up at Craggie Head.

563
00:38:14,187 --> 00:38:17,021
I'll come with you.
Do you want me to drive?

564
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,549
No, certainly not.

565
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,437
I thought you were going
to get a new one of these?

566
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,319
What for.. it's perfectly alright.

567
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:37,087
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done...

568
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:39,668
had it been me
that died in the tunnel in Paris.

569
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:42,432
She would certainly
have taken the boys to Paris.

570
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,483
I rather regret
not doing that know.

571
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,579
What, and expose them to the media?

572
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:49,233
that would have
been a dreadful thing to do.

573
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:50,904
No, they're much better of here...

574
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:52,157
it's private, they're protected.

575
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:56,120
Whatever else you may have thought
of Diana, she was a wonderful mother.

576
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,683
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

577
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:01,823
Always warm, and physical...

578
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:04,035
never afraid to show her feelings...

579
00:39:04,036 --> 00:39:06,216
Especially whenever
a photographer was in sight.

580
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,315
She may have encouraged all that,
but still...

581
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:12,356
that was always the
extraordinary thing about her...

582
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,751
her weaknessess,
and transgressions...

583
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:17,314
only made the public love her more.

584
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,961
And ours only make them hate us.
Why is that?

585
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,214
Why do they hate us so much?

586
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,148
- Not us, dear...
- What?

587
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:28,407
Yesterday, when we
brought the coffin back...

588
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,143
there was a noise, a bang,
I don't mind telling you...

589
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:32,049
I thought it was a gun.

590
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,238
I thought someone
had taken a shot at me.

591
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:39,179
I think I'm going to walk back.

592
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:41,367
I don't feel like stalking.

593
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:43,705
- Oh, are you sure?
- I'll take the dogs.

594
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:45,929
Walkies? yes...

595
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:06,184
Come on...

596
00:40:52,428 --> 00:40:54,675
<i>Do you think...
you'll ever be Queen?</i>

597
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,704
<i>No I don't, no.</i>

598
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,081
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

599
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,237
<i>I like to be a Queen of people's
hearts, in people's hearts.</i>

600
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,046
<i>But I don't see myself as
being Queen of this country.</i>

601
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:14,396
<i>I don't think many people
would want me to be Queen...</i>

602
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,860
<i>Actually, when
I say many people, I mean</i>

603
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,645
<i>the establishment
that I married into.</i>

604
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:23,112
<i>Because they've decided...
that I'm a non-starter.</i>

605
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:28,057
Charles and I
had a talk in the car today.

606
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,429
He was good enough to share with me,
his thoughts on motherhood.

607
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:35,218
What did he say?

608
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,911
How wonderful Diana was...

609
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,860
That's changing his tune.

610
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,005
...and natural.

611
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,153
<i>They see me as
a threat of some kind.</i>

612
00:41:47,523 --> 00:41:48,915
Oh, for Gods sake!

613
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,902
Maybe he's got a point...
Maybe we are partly to blame...

614
00:41:55,185 --> 00:41:57,238
Oh, I can't watch this.

615
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,760
No, no wait..
please, no.. leave it!

616
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,826
We encouraged the match.

617
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:15,652
We signed of on it, both of us.
You were very enthusiastic, remember?

618
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:16,895
She was a nice girl.

619
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:18,404
Then...

620
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,188
And I was sure he'd give
the other one up...

621
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:25,050
or at least make sure
his wife toed the line.

622
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:28,048
Isn't that what everyone does?

623
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,132
Is it?

624
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:36,163
<i>Well, there were three of us,
in this marriage...</i>

625
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:37,690
<i>so it was a bit crowded.</i>

626
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:42,295
I can't bear it anymore..

627
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:44,427
If you're watching,
I'll sleep next door.

628
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,795
Early start tomorrow.

629
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,344
Any luck with your stag?

630
00:42:47,783 --> 00:42:51,462
No, but close.. A couple of
hundred yards at one point.

631
00:42:51,463 --> 00:42:53,558
One of the boys
even got a shot off.

632
00:42:56,098 --> 00:42:58,004
We'll get him tomorrow.

633
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:00,326
See you in the morning.

634
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:03,347
Not to worry.

635
00:43:03,893 --> 00:43:04,796
Night night.

636
00:43:10,962 --> 00:43:14,778
<i>Charles continued to love a woman
he'd fallen for years before...</i>

637
00:43:31,154 --> 00:43:33,915
The good news is that the
Palace has agreed to videoscreens

638
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:35,065
in the Royal Parks...

639
00:43:35,065 --> 00:43:36,781
- And the bad news?
- Crash barriers...

640
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,669
- What about them?
- Well they're now predicting...

641
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,297
more than two million people
in the center of London.

642
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,617
There aren't enough barriers
to line the route.

643
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,257
So we've gone tapping into
the french for theirs.

644
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,539
And there's something else
I think you should see...

645
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,175
- Can we run that piece again?
- Of course.

646
00:43:51,778 --> 00:43:52,940
You're gonna love this...

647
00:43:53,772 --> 00:43:55,661
<i>I don't like their behaviour..
very disgraceful.</i>

648
00:43:55,662 --> 00:43:56,560
<i>What do you think madam?</i>

649
00:43:57,377 --> 00:44:00,278
<i>I think it's disgusting, that they
have not appeared or said a word...</i>

650
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:02,333
<i>relating to all this.</i>

651
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:04,507
- Look, I know all this.
- Wait for it..

652
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,456
<i>- Not to have a flag up, I think it's
a disgrace on the whole royal family.</i>

653
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:10,861
<i>- OK, The Queen's not
in residence today...</i>

654
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:12,189
<i>but where the hell is the flag?</i>

655
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,065
<i>You see what I'm saying
about the establishment?</i>

656
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:19,389
Don't tell me there isn't a flag flying
at half mast over Buckingham Palace..

657
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,254
<i>To people she was their king and
queen, when them two were together</i>

658
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:24,710
<i>it was a fairytale come true...</i>

659
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,132
Will someone please save
these people from themselves.

660
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:30,901
Fine, I'll call Balmoral.

661
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:34,086
Beause as Prime Minister, I really
got nothing better to do.

662
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:35,756
Come on dogs, come on...

663
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:47,933
- Is the firelights alright?
- A bit damp.

664
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:53,038
Well I brought some stew..
just in case.

665
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,019
I think it's lamb.. we could
always have that cold.

666
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,373
No, we'll be alright.

667
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:58,673
Stay.

668
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:06,434
Robin had a call from the Prime Minister,
who expressed his concern...

669
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:08,127
About what?

670
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:11,195
About the flag
above Buckingham Palace.

671
00:45:11,196 --> 00:45:14,406
He thinks it should
be flying at half mast.

672
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:17,716
I hope Robin told him there
isn't a flag above Buckingham Palace.

673
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:20,820
There's the Royal Standard,
which flies for one reason only...

674
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,814
to denote the presence
of the monarch.

675
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:27,422
Since you're here, the flag pole
is bare, which is as it should be.

676
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,263
Isn't it possible, that for some people...

677
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:33,475
the Royal Standard,
is just a flag...

678
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:38,327
And that the flag pole being bare,
sends out the wrong signal..

679
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:39,716
No, that's not the point.

680
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:42,357
The point is, it's
more than 400 years old.

681
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:44,996
It hasn't been
lowered for anyone.

682
00:45:45,266 --> 00:45:48,506
Your grandfather didn't get the
flag at half mast, when he died.

683
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:53,362
If you're mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

684
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:57,323
Yes, granny. But sometimes, in a
situation like this, one has to be flexible.

685
00:45:58,102 --> 00:45:59,751
It is just a flag.

686
00:45:59,752 --> 00:46:03,272
What about the Union Jack?
Was Mr. Blair's next suggestion..

687
00:46:04,258 --> 00:46:05,468
- For heavens sake?
- The next thing he'll be suggesting...

688
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:07,726
you change your name
to Hilda and mine to Hector.

689
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:10,183
Who does he think he's
talking to?

690
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,713
You're the Sovereign, the
Head of State...

691
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:14,511
you don't get dictated to.

692
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:17,330
You've conceded the idea
of a public funeral...

693
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:20,273
you've opened up the parks,
that's enough.

694
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:22,388
Shh... the boys..

695
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:26,523
You wait.. In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

696
00:46:57,957 --> 00:46:59,692
Where once it seemed comforting...

697
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:02,399
for the first time
my parents can see...

698
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,929
what it's been like for me
all these years...

699
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,029
being up against her popularity.

700
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,627
But they're still making the mistake
of thinking that the Diana they knew...

701
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:11,593
from living and dealing with her...

702
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:13,758
will eventually be the one
seen by the public.. but it won't!

703
00:47:15,055 --> 00:47:20,578
The two Dianas, the public's and ours,
bear no relation to one another, at all..

704
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,555
I've been thinking,
the flag of St. George's is

705
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,770
at half mast over High Grove?
- Yes, sir.

706
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,364
Well, make sure we get a picture
of that in the papers, will you?

707
00:47:30,365 --> 00:47:32,675
I'll get on to the tabloids,
call in a few favours.

708
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:35,899
What about a statement
of gratitude, to the crowds?

709
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:40,346
something heartfelt,
from myself and the boys...

710
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:42,458
thanking people
for all the flowers...

711
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,206
and so on.
- Right.

712
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:47,270
<i>Di was wonderful, because she
stood up to the establishment...</i>

713
00:47:47,271 --> 00:47:48,868
<i>we have no-one doing that now...</i>

714
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,325
<i>she said you're detached,
elitist people...</i>

715
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,372
<i>we are paying million of
pounds to be better than us...</i>

716
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,512
<i>and you gotta get out
there amongst the people...</i>

717
00:47:56,513 --> 00:48:00,109
<i>we have a wonderful new
Prime Minister in England, Tony Blair...</i>

718
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,406
<i>a compassionate young man,
who after 18 years...</i>

719
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,303
<i>of establishment toil and row...</i>

720
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:08,715
<i>is such a breath of fresh air,
and I feel he will...</i>

721
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:10,727
<i>do something about this
in England..</i>

722
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:12,333
Do you think this will
be the first stirings of...

723
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:13,206
Of what?

724
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:15,633
I don't know..
something more interesting...

725
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,728
Maybe this time people will finally have
seen them for what they actually are.

726
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:21,711
Which is?

727
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:23,530
A bunch of freeloading...

728
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:24,987
emotionally retarded...

729
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:26,735
nutters!

730
00:48:28,122 --> 00:48:30,623
- That's just absurd.
- Why?

731
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:33,214
They have a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth...

732
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:35,150
and they don't pay tax.
- Yes they do.

733
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:36,020
Not on all their income.

734
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:37,890
The Queen alone costs us,
what.. 30.. 40 million a year?

735
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:40,629
Look.. If you wanna have
a serious conversation...

736
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,836
- I do..
- About the constitution.

737
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:45,047
- We don't have one.
- About ways in which
we as a government...

738
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,883
could phase out hereditary
privileges, then fine...

739
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,586
If you're gonna leave
will you take the plates?

740
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:52,777
But, you know, spare me the
whole off with their heads thing.

741
00:48:52,778 --> 00:48:53,367
Why?

742
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:54,853
Because it insults your intelligence.

743
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:57,866
<i>The Queen can not
be expected to change...</i>

744
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:01,255
It's unimaginable this
country being a republic.

745
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:03,807
- Certainly in her lifetime.
- Why?

746
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:06,286
Because no-one would wear it...

747
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:07,970
No-one wants it.

748
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:11,910
It's just.. daft.

749
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:14,739
It's not a mother thing, is it?

750
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:16,165
What?

751
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:19,803
Well, if she were alive now...

752
00:49:19,804 --> 00:49:21,741
your mother would
be exactly the same age.

753
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:25,072
I mean.. you always say
how stoical she was...

754
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:27,049
old-fashioned, uncomplained...

755
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,263
lived through the war..

756
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,075
Oh, come on..
who does that sound like?

757
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:31,336
I'm gonna go
do the washing-up.

758
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:50,542
That's the stalking party off...

759
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,321
Right...

760
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,995
I'd better have
a look at those papers.

761
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:59,638
"Show us there's a heart, in the
house of Windsor", says The Sun.

762
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:03,155
"It's proof the royals are
not like us", The Mirror.

763
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:06,862
"Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace", Express.

764
00:50:09,259 --> 00:50:12,420
"One can't help wondering
who's advise they're taking...

765
00:50:12,421 --> 00:50:14,382
for it's clearly
the wrong advise"..

766
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,636
I'll try not to take that personally.

767
00:50:19,191 --> 00:50:22,357
People have been yearning
for a change in this country...

768
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:25,612
good.. the result is a quiet
revolution now taking place...

769
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:28,485
lead by the real modernisers..
the British people.

770
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:30,861
Revolution?
Who wrote this?

771
00:50:32,393 --> 00:50:34,361
Where does this come from?

772
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:36,084
Where does it come from?

773
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:38,267
You just won a
huge landslide majority.

774
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,650
People wanna see a change.

775
00:50:40,988 --> 00:50:42,882
Why, what did you
think it meant?

776
00:50:47,071 --> 00:50:49,386
Hurry up dear,
your tea is getting cold.

777
00:50:49,387 --> 00:50:50,100
Is that it?

778
00:50:50,101 --> 00:50:52,748
Yes Ma'am, just the
letter of condolence...

779
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,873
to the widow of
the Ambassador to Brasil.

780
00:50:56,775 --> 00:50:58,391
Good, thank you.

781
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:03,209
Tea!

782
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:08,648
Mr. Janvrin... The Prime Minister
wishes to speak to Her Majesty.

783
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,109
Ma'am...

784
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,101
Apparently the Prime Minister
is on the phone, for you..

785
00:51:18,102 --> 00:51:20,155
Tell him to call back.

786
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:23,996
No, no. It's alright.
I'll take it.

787
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,353
Prime Minister...

788
00:51:34,354 --> 00:51:35,630
Good morning, Your Majesty...

789
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:38,631
sorry to disturb..
but I was just wondering

790
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:40,833
whether you'd seen
any of today's papers?

791
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:44,124
We've managed to
look at one or two...

792
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,884
<i>In which case my...</i>

793
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,355
<i>next question would be...</i>

794
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:53,637
<i>whether you felt some kind of
response, might be necessary?</i>

795
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:59,471
No... I believe a few,
over eager editors...

796
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:01,127
are doing their best
to sell newspapers...

797
00:52:01,224 --> 00:52:03,617
and it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune..

798
00:52:03,618 --> 00:52:06,786
<i>Under normal circumstances
I would agree.</i>

799
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:12,469
<i>But.. well, my advise is...</i>

800
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,592
I've been taking the temperature
among people on the streets..

801
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:18,874
And.. well, the
information I'm getting...

802
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,951
is that the mood...

803
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:23,810
<i>is quite delicate...</i>

804
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:28,821
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

805
00:52:28,822 --> 00:52:30,719
Some kind of a statement?

806
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:36,542
No, Ma'am. I believe that the
moment for statements, has passed..

807
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:43,169
<i>I would suggest flying the flag
at half mast above Buckingham Palace...</i>

808
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:50,918
and coming down to London,
at the earliest opportunity.

809
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:53,875
<i>It would be a
great comfort to your people...</i>

810
00:52:56,018 --> 00:52:59,001
and would help them
with their grief.

811
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,998
Their.. grief?

812
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,997
If you imagine I am going
to drop everything, and come

813
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,287
down to London, before I
attend to my grandchildren...

814
00:53:07,287 --> 00:53:08,652
who have just lost their mother..

815
00:53:10,189 --> 00:53:11,738
then you're mistaken!

816
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:15,100
I doubt there is anyone,
who knows

817
00:53:15,101 --> 00:53:17,259
the British people
more than I do, Mr. Blair...

818
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,453
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgement.

819
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:26,516
And it is my belief they will any
moment reject this.. this mood...

820
00:53:27,533 --> 00:53:30,135
which is being stired up
by the press.

821
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:33,389
In favour of a period of
restrained grief...

822
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,931
and sober private mourning.

823
00:53:37,368 --> 00:53:39,614
That's the way we do
things in this country...

824
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:43,523
quietly.. with dignity.

825
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:48,077
That's what the rest of
the world has always admired us for.

826
00:53:48,078 --> 00:53:50,149
If that's your decision, Ma'am...

827
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,220
then of course,
the government will support it..

828
00:53:53,402 --> 00:53:54,794
Let's keep in touch.

829
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:57,237
Yes. Let's.

830
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:05,132
Bloody fool...

831
00:54:05,706 --> 00:54:08,020
and now your tea's gone cold.

832
00:54:12,521 --> 00:54:15,345
Tony... Robin Janvrin on one.

833
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:17,070
He was listening in..

834
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:23,154
Robin.

835
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:26,481
I understand how
difficult her behaviour must

836
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:29,016
seem to you.
How unhelpful...

837
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:33,068
but try to see it from her perspective.
She's been brought up to believe...

838
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,789
it's God's will...

839
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,423
<i>she is who she is.</i>

840
00:54:36,424 --> 00:54:38,959
I think we should
leave God out of it.

841
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,894
It's just..
not helpful.

842
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:45,071
she just won't have seen anything
like this since the abdication...

843
00:54:45,071 --> 00:54:48,317
and I can not emphasise enough
what affect that had on her.

844
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,738
Unexpectedly becoming King
as good as killed her father.

845
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,888
I'm afraid she's in
a state of shock.

846
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:57,781
This public reaction
has completely thrown her.

847
00:54:58,277 --> 00:54:59,392
Alright...

848
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,842
but first we have to
deal with these terrible headlines.

849
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:06,554
I'll see what I can do
with the press.

850
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:08,213
I'm most grateful,
Prime Minister.

851
00:55:10,195 --> 00:55:11,624
Well I can't promise anything...

852
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:14,335
it's not me they want to see.

853
00:55:38,142 --> 00:55:39,650
Ask Alastair to come and see me.

854
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:40,952
Yes...

855
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:47,021
Cancel what I'm doing tonight.

856
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:53,156
Good morning.

857
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:54,534
- Your Majesty.
- Morning, Ma'am.

858
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:56,529
Thomas.. where have
they gone today?

859
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,225
Up to Ardverikie Reach, Ma'am.

860
00:55:58,857 --> 00:56:02,403
All that way.. Remind me..
that's the track up north..

861
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:06,255
That's right, Ma'am.. You follow
the track for about a mile...

862
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:07,790
- and then you come to...
- The river.

863
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:13,112
- One of the lads will drive you..
- No, no. I'll manage.. thank you.

864
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:17,398
Oh great..

865
00:57:40,563 --> 00:57:42,059
Oh! Stupid..

866
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:06,668
- Hello, Thomas..
- Hello, Ma'am...

867
00:58:06,669 --> 00:58:08,561
I'm afraid I've done
something rather foolish.

868
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:10,453
I've broken the
prop shaft crossing the river.

869
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,877
- Are you sure, Ma'am?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

870
00:58:12,878 --> 00:58:14,726
It's the front one, not the rear.

871
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:16,652
It was a four-wheel drive.

872
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:18,976
Don't forget.. I used to be a
mechanic during the war.

873
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,988
- And, are you alright?
- Yeah yeah, I'm perfectly alright...

874
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:26,155
- We'll come about straight away.
- Oh, would you.. Thank you very much.

875
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:26,942
I'll wait by the car.
You are kind.. bye.

876
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:43,862
Oh.. you're a beauty..

877
01:00:02,574 --> 01:00:03,501
Shoo.. go on!

878
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:08,292
go on... go on..

879
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:45,671
Just been told
there are news crews outside...

880
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:47,762
waiting for you to
come and speak to the people..

881
01:00:47,763 --> 01:00:50,629
- Yes...
- What's all that about?

882
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,303
I told The
Queen's private secretary

883
01:00:52,304 --> 01:00:53,977
I'd do what I could,
to help with the press.

884
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,569
Why?
Don't you think she deserves it?

885
01:00:59,132 --> 01:01:01,722
Sitting up there
on her 40000 acres.

886
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:05,458
Yeah, but allowing her to hang herself,
might not be in our best interest either.

887
01:01:06,669 --> 01:01:10,091
Besides... I think there's something...

888
01:01:10,092 --> 01:01:13,205
ugly, about the way
everyone started to bully her..

889
01:01:34,048 --> 01:01:36,633
The first thing you
obviously think about, is...

890
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:39,104
the rest of your family.
And I think..

891
01:01:44,629 --> 01:01:48,836
she wanted me to pass on to
the people here, crowding around her...

892
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,137
How are the boys?

893
01:01:54,588 --> 01:01:55,369
Not so good, tonight.

894
01:01:56,486 --> 01:02:00,322
A lot of slamming doors..
I think they saw the papers.

895
01:02:00,323 --> 01:02:01,700
Oh no..

896
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:03,677
I'll take them out early
again, tomorrow morning...

897
01:02:05,429 --> 01:02:07,269
Let them take
it out on the stag.

898
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,114
<i>What do you think of the way
the royal family have behaved?</i>

899
01:02:13,115 --> 01:02:15,297
<i>- They've made a serious mistake.
- Pardon?</i>

900
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:17,014
<i>They've made a serious mistake.</i>

901
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:18,609
<i>Why, what do you mean?</i>

902
01:02:19,037 --> 01:02:23,823
<i>Well, they should have came...
the family should have come down...</i>

903
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:27,939
<i>to Buckingham Palace, on
sunday afternoon.. all of them...</i>

904
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:31,940
<i>That girl has been left on her own.
She's on her own up there...</i>

905
01:02:31,941 --> 01:02:33,012
<i>and the place is empty.</i>

906
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:35,098
Oh please...

907
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:38,627
Sleeping in the streets and
pulling out their hair...

908
01:02:38,628 --> 01:02:41,265
for someone they never knew..

909
01:02:41,785 --> 01:02:43,785
and they think we're mad.

910
01:02:43,786 --> 01:02:45,786
Have you seen the latest
funeral guest list?

911
01:02:45,787 --> 01:02:46,828
No...

912
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:48,971
I suggest you keep it that way..

913
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:52,102
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals..

914
01:02:52,887 --> 01:02:55,766
Apparently Elton John
is going to be singing.

915
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:58,372
That would be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

916
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,236
Condolence books are now being
signed in our embassies

917
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,973
in every major city
in the world.

918
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:07,165
And in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

919
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,822
It reminds me of one
of those films.

920
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:13,038
A few of us in a fort...

921
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,741
hordes of Zulus outside.

922
01:03:16,663 --> 01:03:19,171
So it's vital you hold firm.

923
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,177
Stick to your guns...

924
01:03:21,178 --> 01:03:24,504
you wait.. they will
come to their senses soon..

925
01:03:24,505 --> 01:03:26,759
they have to.

926
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,561
Come on!
Move over cabbage!

927
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:41,960
<i>Good morning,
it's 6 o'clock on Thursday</i>

928
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:43,695
<i>the 4th of september.
I'm Penny Smith...</i>

929
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:44,982
<i>and I'm Matthew Lorenzo..</i>

930
01:03:44,983 --> 01:03:46,468
<i>as the first people
start camping out...</i>

931
01:03:46,469 --> 01:03:48,240
<i>on the route of Princess
Dianas funeral courtage...</i>

932
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,406
<i> questions are being asked
about why the Queen...</i>

933
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,371
<i>hasn't addressed her subjects...</i>

934
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,326
<i>at this time of national grief.</i>

935
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:55,987
This is what the newspapers
are saying this morning. The Sun...

936
01:03:55,988 --> 01:04:00,056
Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?

937
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:08,523
The Express,
show us you care...

938
01:04:08,524 --> 01:04:09,648
picture of a grumpy Queen.

939
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:12,921
The Mail, let the
flag fly at half mast...

940
01:04:12,922 --> 01:04:16,446
and inside.. the Queen should
be here to show her respect.

941
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:21,098
But the flip side is,
they're more popular now...

942
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,589
than Churchill's chocolate.

943
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:25,125
Did any of them pick up
on our statement of support?

944
01:04:25,126 --> 01:04:26,511
Well, just the one...

945
01:04:29,913 --> 01:04:32,325
Statements of support,
doesn't sell papers.

946
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,753
Ma'am... Ma'am...

947
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:45,395
the Prime Minister
for you, Ma'am.

948
01:04:46,906 --> 01:04:49,972
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

949
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:52,521
I'll take it in the kitchen.

950
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:01,748
Good morning,
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

951
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:04,305
I'm just expecting a
phone call to come through here.

952
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:05,759
Out!

953
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,394
Oh, there it is..

954
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,341
Thank you.

955
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,416
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Ma'am.

956
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,620
You've seen today's headlines?

957
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:26,485
Yes, I have.

958
01:05:27,217 --> 01:05:30,715
Then I'm sure you'll agree..
the situation has become..

959
01:05:30,716 --> 01:05:32,214
quite critical.

960
01:05:35,013 --> 01:05:36,763
Ma'am?

961
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,248
A poll that's to be published in
tomorrow's papers...

962
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:42,948
suggests that
70 procent of people believe

963
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:45,846
that your actions
have damaged the Monarchy.

964
01:05:47,594 --> 01:05:51,171
And that, one in four,
are now in favour...

965
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:53,348
of abolishing the Monarchy
all together.

966
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:57,159
As your Prime Minister...

967
01:05:58,166 --> 01:06:01,229
I believe it is my
constitutional responsibility...

968
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,393
to advise the following...

969
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:19,118
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

970
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:27,142
Mummy?

971
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:32,862
one.. fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

972
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,849
and all other
royal residences...

973
01:06:37,154 --> 01:06:41,585
two.. leave Balmoral and fly down
to London at the earliest opportunity...

974
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:47,582
three.. pay respects,
in person, at Diana's coffin...

975
01:06:49,189 --> 01:06:52,898
and four.. make a statement
via live television...

976
01:06:52,899 --> 01:06:54,806
to my people
and the world.

977
01:06:56,723 --> 01:07:00,370
Swift prosecution of
these matters might, he felt...

978
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:03,217
just might..
avert disaster.

979
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:07,082
You will have to talk to the
Lord Chamberlain about all this.

980
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:07,694
Well I have..

981
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,483
and to Robert Fellows, and it
seems they both agree with Mr. Blair.

982
01:07:12,663 --> 01:07:13,632
Oh, I see...

983
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:16,265
Something's happened..
there's been a change.. some...

984
01:07:17,086 --> 01:07:18,778
shift in values.

985
01:07:21,552 --> 01:07:22,993
When you no longer
understand your people, mummy...

986
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:26,035
maybe it is time to
hand it over to the next generation?

987
01:07:26,036 --> 01:07:27,544
Oh, don't be ridiculous..

988
01:07:28,156 --> 01:07:30,543
remember the vow you took?

989
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,391
I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short...

990
01:07:36,392 --> 01:07:38,498
shall be devoted to your service.

991
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,308
Your whole life.

992
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:44,015
That is a commitment to God...

993
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:45,221
as well as your people.

994
01:07:45,222 --> 01:07:47,826
But what if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

995
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:49,487
Damaging it!?

996
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:52,948
You're the greatest asset
this institution has...

997
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:55,582
one of the greatest
it has ever had.

998
01:07:57,347 --> 01:08:03,073
The problem will come when you leave..
but you mustn't think about that now...

999
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,517
Certainly not today.

1000
01:08:04,518 --> 01:08:05,585
Oh, mummy..

1001
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,209
You must show your strenght...

1002
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:10,558
reasert your authority.

1003
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:15,278
You sit on the most
powerful throne in Europe.

1004
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,660
Head of an unbroken line that
goes back more than a thousand years.

1005
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,931
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything...

1006
01:08:23,932 --> 01:08:27,583
and gone up to London
because a bunch of hysterics..

1007
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:30,834
carrying candles,
needed help with their grief?

1008
01:08:33,223 --> 01:08:34,718
As for that...

1009
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:38,986
silly Mr. Blair..
with his Cheshire Cat grin...

1010
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:55,529
Mr. Janvrin on the
phone for you, Sir..

1011
01:08:57,414 --> 01:08:58,825
Yes?

1012
01:08:59,246 --> 01:09:00,242
What?

1013
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,265
I can't hear!

1014
01:09:04,121 --> 01:09:07,947
That's madness...
the whole thing!

1015
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:10,083
Bloody madness!

1016
01:09:14,436 --> 01:09:15,696
I've just been told...

1017
01:09:16,962 --> 01:09:21,189
You've... decided to follow the
Prime Minister's advise...

1018
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:23,626
I just want to say, I...

1019
01:09:25,367 --> 01:09:26,424
admire...

1020
01:09:29,563 --> 01:09:30,811
I think it's the right decision.

1021
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,669
Let's hope we haven't
left it too late.

1022
01:10:20,223 --> 01:10:22,474
<i>Clearly The Queen
has had a change of heart...</i>

1023
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,625
<i>she's clearly responding to
the need to feel...</i>

1024
01:10:24,626 --> 01:10:27,632
<i>that the royal family
is somehow engaged.</i>

1025
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:31,878
<i>These are flowers that have been
brought to the gates of Balmoral...</i>

1026
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:33,214
<i>so that she can actually see</i>

1027
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,149
<i>some token, of what's been
expressed down here in London..</i>

1028
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:38,667
- Fish Fingers.. do you want any?
- I'll be right there..

1029
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,398
Thank God, for that!

1030
01:11:13,208 --> 01:11:16,989
<i>Britain's Queen Elisabeth will
deliver a televised address Friday...</i>

1031
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:20,069
<i>the royal family has been accused
of not showing enough remorse...</i>

1032
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,548
<i>over Princess Diana's death...</i>

1033
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,476
Where are the boys?
Have they already left?

1034
01:11:44,477 --> 01:11:45,187
Yes...

1035
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:48,096
they left for London,
after breakfast, with Charles.

1036
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:51,413
It's not right, you know...

1037
01:11:51,414 --> 01:11:54,313
No, but further discussion
is no longer helpful, either.

1038
01:11:55,515 --> 01:11:57,007
Oh, well..

1039
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,647
I suppose it does give the ghillies time
to find another stag for the boys.

1040
01:12:02,261 --> 01:12:03,893
- Now there's has been shot.
- What?

1041
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:05,410
Haven't you heard?

1042
01:12:06,012 --> 01:12:08,083
He wandered over to one
of the neighbouring estates...

1043
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:10,708
where one of the
commercial guests got him.

1044
01:12:14,846 --> 01:12:15,734
Oh.. really?

1045
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:18,921
Which estate?

1046
01:12:36,688 --> 01:12:37,527
Here's your box.

1047
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,980
There's some policy and
stuff in here that's important.

1048
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,474
Have you seen the papers?

1049
01:12:42,475 --> 01:12:45,116
No, I thought I'd give them a miss today..
of course I've seen the papers!

1050
01:12:45,117 --> 01:12:49,531
Not bad, eh.. Your Majesty
have come down to London...

1051
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:50,781
Who says that?
Tony Blair.

1052
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,618
Mr. Father of the nation.

1053
01:13:10,959 --> 01:13:12,630
Ma'am...

1054
01:13:12,631 --> 01:13:13,781
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

1055
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:16,822
Is it his Lordship,
you've come to see?

1056
01:13:16,823 --> 01:13:20,517
No, please don't disturb him..
I've come on another matter..

1057
01:13:20,518 --> 01:13:21,874
I hope you don't mind?

1058
01:13:43,126 --> 01:13:44,063
There he is..

1059
01:13:46,225 --> 01:13:48,617
a beauty, isn't he?

1060
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:51,971
An imperial, Ma'am.

1061
01:13:52,563 --> 01:13:54,340
14 pointer.

1062
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:05,311
- He was wounded?
- Yes...

1063
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,992
We got our guest in very close..
had him lined up perfect.

1064
01:14:11,506 --> 01:14:12,664
And still...

1065
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:16,195
an investment banker, Ma'am..
from London.

1066
01:14:16,806 --> 01:14:20,448
I'm afraid the stalkers had to
follow him for miles, to finish him off..

1067
01:14:23,705 --> 01:14:25,741
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

1068
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:38,406
Please pass my congratulations,
to your guest.

1069
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,292
I will, Ma'am...

1070
01:14:46,744 --> 01:14:48,233
God bless you, Ma'am.

1071
01:14:48,362 --> 01:14:49,473
Thank you.

1072
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:24,017
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Robin...

1073
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:26,939
I've done a draft,
of your television address.

1074
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:27,988
Thank you.

1075
01:15:32,424 --> 01:15:34,038
Was there anything else?

1076
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:36,512
No, Ma'am.

1077
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:39,479
Landing in 15 minutes.

1078
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,983
I've got The Queen's speech.

1079
01:15:53,985 --> 01:15:56,625
- Shall I give Tony a copy?
- No, let me have a look at it first...

1080
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:57,626
- He's next door.

1081
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:51,301
<i>The Queen is getting out of the car...
and is going to talk to people.</i>

1082
01:16:51,747 --> 01:16:55,151
<i>It's extremely unusual..
this is almost unprecedented..</i>

1083
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,555
<i>I think perhaps the last time
The Queen was among her people...</i>

1084
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:02,677
<i>outside the Palace..
was the day the war in Europe ended.</i>

1085
01:17:24,493 --> 01:17:26,586
They sent a copy
of The Queen's speech...

1086
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:30,717
Well, let's get the frost off it first.

1087
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:40,818
I've phoned them
with a couple of suggestions...

1088
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,320
to make it sound like it
came from a human being.

1089
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:44,233
Yeah, alright Alastair..

1090
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:49,969
Well at least the old bat has
finally agreed to visit Diana's coffin.

1091
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,475
When you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong...

1092
01:17:53,038 --> 01:17:57,038
that woman has given her
whole life in service to her people.

1093
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,675
50 years doing the job,
she never wanted...

1094
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:01,686
a job she watched kill her father...

1095
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:06,112
she's executed it with honour, dignity,
and as far as I could tell...

1096
01:18:06,113 --> 01:18:08,923
without a single blemish,
and now we're all baying for her blood.

1097
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:11,702
All because she's struggling
to lead the world in mourning

1098
01:18:11,703 --> 01:18:14,481
for someone who threw everything
she offered back in her face.

1099
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:17,227
and who for the last few years
seemed commited 24/7

1100
01:18:17,228 --> 01:18:19,972
to destroying everything
she holds most dear.

1101
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:25,642
Hello.. would you like
me to place those for you?

1102
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:26,707
No...

1103
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:28,636
Oh...

1104
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:30,210
These are for you.

1105
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:34,011
For me?

1106
01:19:37,972 --> 01:19:38,878
Thank you.

1107
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:42,232
Thank you very much.

1108
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,577
There's been a last minute
addition from Downing Street.

1109
01:20:14,578 --> 01:20:17,143
They're suggesting adding,
'and as a grandmother'...

1110
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:18,867
here.
- Right.

1111
01:20:23,854 --> 01:20:27,965
So what I say to you now, as
your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1112
01:20:28,585 --> 01:20:30,577
I say from my heart.

1113
01:20:31,445 --> 01:20:32,466
You think you can say it?

1114
01:20:33,214 --> 01:20:36,541
- Do I have a choice?
- We're ready for you, Your Majesty.

1115
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:42,051
Just to confirm,
this is going out live.

1116
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:43,845
- Fine.
- And you'll be at the front of

1117
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:45,638
the 6 o'clock news..
on all the channels.

1118
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:47,048
Yes.

1119
01:21:28,848 --> 01:21:31,024
<i>- Okay, nice and quiet..
- Ten seconds, everyone!</i>

1120
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:38,061
<i>We cross now, live,
to Buckingham Palace...</i>

1121
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:40,587
<i>for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.</i>

1122
01:21:46,413 --> 01:21:49,254
Since last Sundays'
dreadful news...

1123
01:21:49,255 --> 01:21:51,920
we have seen throughout Britain,
and around the world...

1124
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,846
an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana's death.

1125
01:21:57,634 --> 01:22:00,929
We have all been trying,
in our different ways, to cope...

1126
01:22:01,796 --> 01:22:04,322
it is not easy
to express a sense of loss...

1127
01:22:04,323 --> 01:22:06,689
since the initial shock,
is often succeeded

1128
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,655
by a mixture
of other feelings...

1129
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:13,871
disbelief, incomprehension, anger..
and concern for those who remain.

1130
01:22:16,153 --> 01:22:20,168
We have all felt those
emotions in these last few days...

1131
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:24,422
so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1132
01:22:25,116 --> 01:22:27,699
I say from my heart.

1133
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,002
Heart..
What heart?

1134
01:22:30,383 --> 01:22:31,910
She doesn't mean a word of this.

1135
01:22:32,517 --> 01:22:35,215
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

1136
01:22:37,454 --> 01:22:39,175
That's how to survive.

1137
01:22:39,176 --> 01:22:40,450
Listen to you..

1138
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:43,725
a week ago you were the
great moderniser...

1139
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:46,233
making speeches
about the people's Princess.

1140
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:48,706
Now you've gone weak at the knees.

1141
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:54,663
You know.. I don't know
why I'm so surprised..

1142
01:22:55,362 --> 01:22:57,307
at the end of the day,
all Labour Prime Ministers...

1143
01:22:57,308 --> 01:23:00,452
go ga-ga for the Queen.

1144
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:01,494
What?

1145
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:12,264
I, for one, believe that there are
lessons to be drawn from her life...

1146
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:15,834
and from the extraordinary,
and moving, reaction to her death.

1147
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:20,777
I share in your determination,
to cherish her memory.

1148
01:23:21,436 --> 01:23:25,277
I hope that tomorrow we
can all, wherever we are...

1149
01:23:25,278 --> 01:23:28,876
join in expressing our grief,
at Diana's loss...

1150
01:23:28,877 --> 01:23:31,857
and gratitude for her
all too short life.

1151
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:35,223
May those who died,
rest in peace...

1152
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:38,210
and may we,
each and everyone of us...

1153
01:23:38,211 --> 01:23:43,678
thank God, for someone who
made many, many people, happy.

1154
01:23:50,529 --> 01:23:53,321
<i>Diana's coffin, now on the move...</i>

1155
01:23:53,322 --> 01:23:55,486
<i>the short distance
from St. James' Palace...</i>

1156
01:23:55,487 --> 01:23:58,850
<i>to her home at Kensington
Palace, for the final night...</i>

1157
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:00,589
<i>before her burial tomorrow.</i>

1158
01:24:02,307 --> 01:24:03,305
<i>It's incredible...</i>

1159
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:05,046
<i>less than a week.</i>

1160
01:24:05,539 --> 01:24:07,481
<i>Who could have imagined,
such scenes?</i>

1161
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:23,485
Diana was the very essence
of compassion, of duty...

1162
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:26,007
of style, of beauty.

1163
01:25:26,008 --> 01:25:28,192
A very British girl...

1164
01:25:28,193 --> 01:25:30,347
who transcended nationality.

1165
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:33,156
Someone with
a natural nobility...

1166
01:25:33,157 --> 01:25:36,689
who was classless, and who
proved in the last year...

1167
01:25:36,690 --> 01:25:40,163
that she needed no royal title
to continue to generate...

1168
01:25:40,164 --> 01:25:42,032
a particular brand of magic.

1169
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,275
I would like to end by,
thanking God...

1170
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,990
for the small mercies he's
shown us at this dreadful time...

1171
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:55,088
for taking Diana at
her most beautiful and radiant.

1172
01:25:55,089 --> 01:25:57,297
And when she had joy,
in her private life.

1173
01:25:58,299 --> 01:26:00,681
Above all, we give thanks
for the life of a woman...

1174
01:26:00,682 --> 01:26:03,363
I'm so proud
to be able to call my sister.

1175
01:26:03,364 --> 01:26:06,218
The uniqe, the complexed...

1176
01:26:06,219 --> 01:26:09,225
the extraordinary,
and irreplaceable, Diana.

1177
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,637
Who's beauty, both internal
and external...

1178
01:26:12,638 --> 01:26:15,457
will never be extinguished
from our minds.

1179
01:27:08,449 --> 01:27:13,672
- So, off to see your girlfriend?
- Now, now.

1180
01:27:14,921 --> 01:27:17,023
You know, I hope she
shows you some respect this time.

1181
01:27:17,748 --> 01:27:19,863
It's quite a debt of gratitude,
she owes you.

1182
01:27:20,613 --> 01:27:22,982
Mr. Saviour of the Monarchy.

1183
01:27:23,701 --> 01:27:25,512
I doubt she'll see it that way..

1184
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:32,784
- Robin.. good to see you.
- Prime Minister.

1185
01:27:32,784 --> 01:27:33,697
Tony, please.

1186
01:27:44,584 --> 01:27:45,805
The Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

1187
01:27:54,654 --> 01:27:55,542
Do sit down.

1188
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:57,643
Thank you.

1189
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:10,529
It's good to see you again.

1190
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:14,915
After what's been..
quite a summer.

1191
01:28:15,382 --> 01:28:17,817
I'm refering to your visit
to India.. and Pakistan.

1192
01:28:18,578 --> 01:28:21,181
Where your comments on
ending historic disagreements...

1193
01:28:21,182 --> 01:28:22,985
went down very well.

1194
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:26,644
On the commonwealth heads
of government meeting...

1195
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:29,836
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi...

1196
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:32,244
and he was saying
how much he appreciated your...

1197
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:34,653
tough stands on Nigeria...

1198
01:28:34,654 --> 01:28:36,421
I meant to tell you at the time, but...

1199
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:39,827
you were being monopolised, rather...

1200
01:28:43,066 --> 01:28:45,265
I imagine those occations
must be quite difficult.

1201
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:50,457
24 heads of government, each
clamouring for a private audience.

1202
01:28:54,732 --> 01:28:59,201
Also we have another
chance to speak, since.. that week.

1203
01:29:02,247 --> 01:29:04,223
And I wanted to offer my apologies.

1204
01:29:04,223 --> 01:29:05,579
Whatever for?

1205
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,018
In case you felt manhandled, or..
managed, in any way.

1206
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:11,376
No, not at all.

1207
01:29:16,973 --> 01:29:20,497
I don't think I shall ever understand,
what happened this summer.

1208
01:29:20,497 --> 01:29:24,581
Well.. the circumstances
were exceptional, Ma'am..

1209
01:29:25,398 --> 01:29:28,546
and in the end you
showed great personal strenght...

1210
01:29:29,247 --> 01:29:31,045
courage and humility.

1211
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:33,588
You're confusing humility,
with humiliation.

1212
01:29:33,589 --> 01:29:35,033
That's not true.

1213
01:29:35,034 --> 01:29:38,897
You didn't read the cards on the
flowers outside the Palace, that Friday.

1214
01:29:39,718 --> 01:29:42,813
I actually think history will show,
it was a good week for you.

1215
01:29:42,814 --> 01:29:44,764
And an even better one
for you, Mr. Blair.

1216
01:29:45,971 --> 01:29:48,023
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, Ma'am...

1217
01:29:48,024 --> 01:29:52,844
and 2500 in the time
since you've been Queen.

1218
01:29:55,787 --> 01:29:58,340
And when people come
to assess your legacy...

1219
01:29:58,341 --> 01:30:00,475
they won't remember those few days.
- Oh, really?

1220
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:05,438
You don't think what affection
people once had for...

1221
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:08,217
for this institution...

1222
01:30:09,294 --> 01:30:10,315
has been diminished?

1223
01:30:10,316 --> 01:30:11,323
No...

1224
01:30:11,324 --> 01:30:12,651
not at all.

1225
01:30:13,476 --> 01:30:15,695
You're more respected now,
than ever...

1226
01:30:15,696 --> 01:30:19,510
I gather some of your closest advisers
were less fulsome in their support.

1227
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,252
One or two...

1228
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:27,018
but as a leader, I could never
have added my voice to that chorus.

1229
01:30:27,019 --> 01:30:28,143
Because you saw those headlines,
and you thought...

1230
01:30:28,144 --> 01:30:30,268
one day that might happen to me.

1231
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:34,421
And it will, Mr. Blair.

1232
01:30:35,015 --> 01:30:37,033
Quite suddenly, and without warning.

1233
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:42,289
So.. shall we get on
with the business in hand?

1234
01:30:44,302 --> 01:30:45,438
Oh, look...

1235
01:30:47,202 --> 01:30:49,733
I do love this time of day.

1236
01:30:49,734 --> 01:30:51,638
Shall we walk, while there is still light?

1237
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:54,526
You know the clocks go back
next week, it will be dark before five.

1238
01:30:55,011 --> 01:30:57,613
- I do hope you're a walker?
- I am...

1239
01:30:57,614 --> 01:31:00,624
Good.. I always think these meetings
have a far greater chance of success...

1240
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:02,635
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

1241
01:31:03,683 --> 01:31:05,693
As a matter of fact,  that's
how I think best.. on my feet..

1242
01:31:05,694 --> 01:31:08,705
I've never been one
for sitting around endlessly...

1243
01:31:08,706 --> 01:31:11,283
a good walk and fresh air
sorts everything out.

1244
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:19,810
One in four.. you said..
wanted to get rid of me.

1245
01:31:19,811 --> 01:31:21,512
For about half an hour.

1246
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:23,320
But then...

1247
01:31:23,321 --> 01:31:26,470
you came down to London,
and all that went away.

1248
01:31:28,544 --> 01:31:31,449
I've never been hated
like that before.

1249
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,897
Then, that
must have been difficult..

1250
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:35,728
Yes...

1251
01:31:36,274 --> 01:31:37,143
very.

1252
01:31:41,093 --> 01:31:45,007
Nowadays people want glamour,
and tears, the grand performance.

1253
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:47,580
I'm not very good at that,
I never have been...

1254
01:31:48,923 --> 01:31:51,304
I prefer to keep
my feelings to myself.

1255
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:56,045
And foolishly I believed that was
what people wanted from their Queen...

1256
01:31:56,046 --> 01:31:59,336
not to make a fuss, nor wear one's
heart on one's sleeve...

1257
01:31:59,337 --> 01:32:01,571
duty first, self second.

1258
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,008
That's how I was brought up...

1259
01:32:06,386 --> 01:32:08,328
that's all I've ever known.

1260
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:10,837
You were so young
when you became Queen.

1261
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:18,236
Yes...

1262
01:32:20,229 --> 01:32:21,728
Yes, a girl.

1263
01:32:27,028 --> 01:32:29,885
But I can see
that the world has changed...

1264
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:34,183
and one must.. modernise.

1265
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:38,809
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

1266
01:32:40,631 --> 01:32:42,596
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister, and remember...

1267
01:32:42,597 --> 01:32:45,161
I am the one
supposed to be advising you.
