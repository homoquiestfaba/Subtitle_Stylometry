1
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:32,236
Horror is absolutely necessary.

2
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:36,616
Fear is part of our DNA.

3
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,122
We are born with an
instinctive sense of fear.

4
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:50,338
We have to avoid what scares us but
if we don't know what scares us,

5
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:55,218
you won't be able to escape from it.

6
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:16,148
(Goya) tries, in a crude way,
to tell how crazy we are.

7
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,610
That is, in a way, what
we do with a horror film.

8
00:30:28,804 --> 00:30:32,140
Goya is fantastic. Goya was the first one.

9
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,305
Goya was the first one of us.

10
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:11,753
Really, the day of the dead
celebrates a festive cycle related to

11
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:14,881
the production, the life
and death, of corn.

12
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:20,220
And it's the time of abundance, when
you can give back to your ancestors.

13
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:25,767
Since they've been helping you from
the ground, because they are buried.

14
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:31,521
And it's said that in Xochimilco
we don't bury men, we sow them.

15
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:08,685
National culture has been
deeply affected by Halloween.

16
00:36:08,894 --> 00:36:13,398
And by these images that are not
necessarily part of our culture.

17
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:17,068
They make it sinister when it isn't.

18
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:24,451
Nobody would find it logical that you would give
an offering to a being that is here to hurt you.

19
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:29,998
So there is this pressure that says Day of
Dead is to be frightened or to be scared.

20
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,500
And it's not like that.

21
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:19,754
Committing violent and sadistic acts,

22
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:31,641
So by watching horror films they can vicariously
experience it and feel excitement and catharsis.

23
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:40,385
I'm not the type, but for people with
sadistic urges it can provide a release.

24
00:57:23,717 --> 00:57:26,469
Kabuki theatre, as well as Noh theatre,

25
00:57:26,595 --> 00:57:30,432
both originally began as
entertainment for commoners.

26
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,895
In order to make the elements of
the story easily identifiable,

27
00:57:35,604 --> 00:57:39,232
the characters on the stage are
presented in a fixed figure or form.

28
00:57:39,482 --> 00:57:44,070
Most of the time, ghosts
appear in a white kimono.

29
00:57:44,362 --> 00:57:49,910
Ghosts are just humans. People.

30
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:54,956
They represent the darkness
that we carry inside.

31
00:57:55,148 --> 00:58:03,160
What humans are most afraid of is nature.
Natural phenomena. Such as the dark or snakes.

32
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:53,206
Women are not able to express themselves
aggressively through violence like men,

33
00:58:53,415 --> 00:59:00,714
meaning they have all these negative
feelings swirling inside, which is scary.

34
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:11,182
And then when they die in that state, even after
they die, their grudgeful spirit remains.

35
00:59:11,433 --> 00:59:17,022
In Japanese Buddhism,
when you kill something

36
00:59:17,397 --> 00:59:20,775
there will be karmic retribution.

37
00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:24,237
Horror has perhaps been used to

38
00:59:24,362 --> 00:59:27,449
teach this concept of retribution.

39
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:33,330
That type of spirit has endured as one of

40
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:38,335
the most frightening things
in Japanese culture.

41
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:26,549
In around 1997-98 a Japanese horror film

42
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:31,221
called "The Ring" was released in cinemas.

43
01:00:31,346 --> 01:00:35,798
I heard that when "The Exorcist"
was released in the US,

44
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,198
it caused panic at the theatres.

45
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:45,676
The same kind of thing happened when

46
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:48,249
"The Ring" was released
in Japanese cinemas.

47
01:04:08,104 --> 01:04:11,357
Evil Dead is a movie you
have to watch with friends.

48
01:04:11,482 --> 01:04:14,444
You have to get a video... it's
better in video than in the theatre.

49
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:19,157
You get a VHS. A bad quality VHS.

50
01:04:19,365 --> 01:04:24,537
Put it on the TV, lots
of popcorn, pizza, beer.

51
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:29,042
All of that together becomes a party.

52
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:31,753
There's nothing more fun than
everybody screaming together.

53
01:05:06,412 --> 01:05:09,832
Initially when I was developing
the first Resident Evil,

54
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:13,336
there wasn't much of a puzzle
solving element to it.

55
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:20,718
In the early stages the game was a
straight forward action-survival shooter

56
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:25,390
and became overly simplistic.

57
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:31,479
In thinking of the world of
the game, I wanted to include

58
01:05:31,604 --> 01:05:35,441
puzzle-solving elements. By doing that

59
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:41,831
we tried to expand and enhance the
gaming experience for players.

60
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:31,565
Fear is not necessarily
a bad thing, I think.

61
01:12:31,691 --> 01:12:36,445
I believe that it is good to know
the existence of scary things.

62
01:12:36,737 --> 01:12:39,782
Why are scary things considered to be bad?

63
01:12:39,907 --> 01:12:44,745
Creating scary stories is totally different
from hurting or cheating people.

64
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,997
Horror stories used to be a
part of general education.

65
01:12:47,123 --> 01:12:50,126
People learned about the wide scope
of this world through horror stories.

66
01:15:30,494 --> 01:15:35,040
Why horror? One thing I can say
about the nature of horror;

67
01:15:35,124 --> 01:15:41,422
it is like a mystery that
can never be solved.

68
01:15:41,755 --> 01:15:44,717
It's sort of like a perpetual history.

69
01:15:44,842 --> 01:15:50,185
And I think if the mystery of horror
is solved, it loses its fascination.
