Tangerines.

- Uh, for you, 30.
- Hmm. What do you think, Elmer?

40

Well, these ones
from the bottom are overripe.

- They're sprouting from the inside.
- Oh, so I see.

42

We'll give you half on the tangerines.

Twenty-five, Dela.
That's the best I can do.

I need to borrow some change, all right?

173
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,791
- But that's the money...
- [Dela] I need to make calls.

174
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,333
Come outside with me.

175
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,750

[car honking]

177
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,875
Don't use them all up, Mom.

178
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,083
- We can't get our store without it.
- It's just a few coins. No big deal.

179
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,583
- How are we gonna...
- Hello.

180
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,583
Yes, yes, I'm calling about the ad.

181
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,416
I have my own truck. It's... it's gone?

182
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,583
- [sighs] All right. Bye.
- Mom?

183
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,916
[Dela] It's okay. Just one more.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,791
Hello. Hi, I'm calling about the ad.

185
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,875
Wait. I have my own truck,
and the first delivery is free. All right.

186
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,583
But, Mom, maybe I can help.

187
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,250
[Dela] I just need you to be quiet. Hello.

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,583
Yes, yes, I'm calling about the ad.

189
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,291
[fading] No, wait! You don't understand.
You see, I have my own truck...

[grunts] Get off of me!

198
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,833
[clears throat] Callie, help!

199
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,541
- Shoo! Shoo! Go, go, go!
- [cat sputters]

200
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,291
- Get your milk someplace else.
- [screams]

201
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,666
Are you okay, Gertie?

202
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,291
[Gertie] Uh-huh.

203
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,208
- You ready, Eugene?
- I'm ready!

204
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,208
And... hit it!

205
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,583
[guitar playing]

206
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,958
'Tis a dark and dreary night!

207
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,041
Aha!

208
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,125
The wind is howling.

209
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,791
[mimicking wind howling]

210
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:40,208
A far-off land teeters
at the very edge of oblivion.

211
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,500
Thank you very much.

212
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,750
The animals cry out,

213
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,791
[dramatic voice]
"Is there no one who can save us?"

214
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,041
Thank you.

215
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:52,541
Yes! Yes! There is one who can save them.

216
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,333
One who's traveled both far and wide...

217
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,250
Rubber bands for sale!

218
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,791
All kinds of colors. Amazing deals.
Get 'em before they're gone.

219
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,875

Red ones, blue ones. Rubber bands?
You look like you need rubber bands.

Today only?

226
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,000
- I said...
- Oh, I'd better hurry.

227
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:29,500
- I know you need some rubber bands.
- A flying dragon!

228
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,875
- [Elmer] You can wear them!
- [woman] That sure is a bargain.

229
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,583
- Thank you, ma'am.
- [Callie] Hey!

230
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,666
You took our customer!
She was about to put that coin in <i>my</i> hat.

231
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,125
Well, it's mine now.

232
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:44,375
No, it's not.
'Cause we were here first doin' our show.

233
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,041
Uh, looks like your show
isn't as spectacular as rubber bands.

234
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,541
Okay. Here's how it's going to be.
You're either going to give me that coin,

235
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,791
or you're gonna give me
something out of that backpack.

236
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,500
- No.
- You must have something for our show.

237
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,125
- It's mine.
- But you owe me. Fair is fair.

238
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,875
- No, I don't!
- [screams]

239
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,250
- [Callie] Do so.
- [Eugene grunts]

240
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,666
[Elmer and Callie groan]

241
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,000
- [roars, screams]
- Get off!

242
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,500
[gasps] I got it, Callie!

243
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,125
- Hey! Those kids...
- [Dela] Come on.

244
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,500
- We have to get back inside.
- Come back here!

245
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,708
You take from me, I take from you.

246
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,125
- They took...
- Please, come on.

247
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,958
I'm tired,
and I have to cook supper. Okay?

248
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,583
[hesitates] They...

249
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,166
[pipe clanging]

250
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,208

[Dela grunts]

252
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,250
Hey there.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,750
How did you get in here?
Did you follow me?

254
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll be back in a minute.

255
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,708
[Dela] Don't drink all of that.
We need some for breakfast.

256
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,791
[Elmer] Okay.

257
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,000
- [meows]
- Shh!

258
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,916
You've got to be quiet.
No pets allowed in the apartment.

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,083
- Did you say something?
- No, Mom.

260
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,791
- [Dela] Come and eat before it gets cold.
- I'm coming.

261
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,541
- [meows]
- Shh!

262
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,875
Don't make a sound.
I'll figure something out.

263
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,791
Hmm! That smells really nice, Mom!

264
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,791
[sighs]

265
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,875
[cat meows]

266
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,541
Hey, look at that.

267
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,625
Mom, I...

268
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,958
Are you trying to get us thrown out
on the street?

269
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,000
'Cause if you are,
this is a good way to go about it.

270
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,958
- You don't understand.
- There's nothing to understand.

271
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,083
Put the cat back wherever you found it,
or Mrs. McClaren will tell us to go!

272
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,916
- But, I didn't...
- I don't care. I don't have time for this.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,750
- I can explain.
- I've had enough.

274
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,500
You're about to lie,
and I don't wanna hear it.

275
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,208
You're the liar! You told me
we'd start up our store right out there!

276
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,166
It's not that simple.

277
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,416
But you promised!

278
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,208
[hesitates] I didn't mean right now.

279
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:08,541
- Why don't you tell me the truth?
- You want me to tell you the truth?

280
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,750
I needed you to get out of the truck.
That's all.

281
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,083
[screams] And now I need you to get
that cat out of this apartment!

282
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,750
Because I have enough
to worry about, okay?

283
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,583
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,833
Don't be scared.

285
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,833
I'm not scared!

286
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,208
[cries] I'll get the money,
and I'll open the store myself.

287
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,416
You'll see.

288
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,291
- Elmer.
- [door closes]

289
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,208
Hey! No runnin' on the stairs!

290
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,916
- Is that a cat?
- [cat meows]

291
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,625
What in the world is going on?

292
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,833
I'm doing this all by myself, Elmer.

293
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,458
- [footsteps departing]
- [sad music plays]

294
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
[door closes]

295
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,875
Elmer!

296
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,166

[Elmer's voice echoes]
<i>What do we do now, Mom?</i>

299
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,250
[Dela] <i>You don't have
to worry about a thing. That's my job.</i>

300
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,875
<i>That's my job.</i>

301
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,250
- [Elmer] <i>Maybe I can help.</i>
- [Dela] <i>I just need you to be quiet.</i>

[women laugh]

[Elmer] <i>Hey! You come back here!</i>

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,875
[Callie] <i>That money belongs to us.</i>

305
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,083
- [Elmer] <i>That's mine!</i>
- [Callie] <i>Get him!</i>

- [panting]
- [woman yells indistinctly]

307

[Dela] <i>I don't have time for this.</i>

308
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,434
[McClaren]
<i>You didn't say anything about a kid.</i>

309
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,976
[Dela] <i>I didn't think it'd be a problem.</i>

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,583
[McClaren] <i>Kids cost extra.</i>

311
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,875
[Dela] <i>I have enough to worry about, okay?</i>

312
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,458
- [Dela] <i>Elmer.</i>
- [grunts]

313
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,791

[meows]

318
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Hey, cat.

319
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,666
Why is everything so hard?

320
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,625
Are you asking me, or...

321
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,708
Whoa! [yelps, gasps]

322
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,666
Oh. [laughs]

323
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,583
You were just talking to yourself.
I get it.

324
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,208
[gasps] You're...

325
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,875
- Whoa.
- Elmer. Elmer?

326
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,750
[grunting]

327
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, for goodness' sake. Elmer!

328
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:26,416
[panting] No.
You're... a talking cat? No, no, no.

329
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,375
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll answer any questions you have.

330
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,458
[gasps]

331
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,958
How... how come you can talk?

332
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,541
[scoffs] You were kind to me.

333
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:45,458
So now I'm gonna return
that kindness... to you, Elmer.

334
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:50,000
Um, are you, like,
gonna grant me seven wishes?

335
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,208
I am not that kind of magic.

336
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,625
And isn't it usually three wishes?

337
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,208
Well... I need a lot of help.

338
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,916
I need to open a store for my mom and me
so she doesn't have to worry anymore.

339
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,750
But I haven't got any money, and...

340
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,708
And this is where I can help.

341
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,666
See, I don't just talk. I listen.

342
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,125
Down here at the docks,
I hear about all kinds of things.

343
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,375
Things that might earn
a young person like yourself

344
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,750
the money you need to open your store.

345
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,125
Like what?

346
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,541
An amazing, spectacular,

347
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,750
real live,

348
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:29,458
flying, fire-breathing... dragon!

349
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,833
[laughs]

350
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,583
Yeah, no. Dragons aren't real.

351
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,875
Neither are talking cats. [laughs]

352
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:42,958
Can't you just imagine having your
very own dragon here in Nevergreen City?

353
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,291
Yeah, but how...

354
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,708
[shushes] Just imagine.

355
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,416

357
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:59,458
You and your mom won't have to worry
about another thing.

358
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:02,833
[dragon snarling]

359
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,791
[Elmer] Wow.

360
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,958
[hesitates] I could sell rides
and candy and souvenirs!

361
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,583
And Mom and I
could finally start our store!

362
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,458
Tell me where the dragon is.
How do I get it?

363
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,041
That's the easy part.

364
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:21,333
It's just sitting there...
on this little, tiny island.

365
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,833
But how do I get to the island?

366
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,541
That's easy too.

367
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,958
I got you a ride.

368
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,833
- Whoa! [groans]
- [loud thump]

369
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,333

371
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,375

- Say hello to Soda.

372
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,625
[squeals]

373
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,875
That kinda tickles a little. Uh. [giggles]

374
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:43,791
[Cat] Soda.

375
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,208
- Yes?
- Say hello.

376
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,958
- Hello!
- [Elmer screams, groans]

377
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,458
Uh, he's... he's got it, Soda.

378
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,916
I'm supposed to ride
a whale to the island?

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,041
- [Soda giggles]
- [grunts]

380
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,375
It's the best I could do on short notice.

381
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,375
[Soda] Uh.

382
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,666
[giggles]

383
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,625
Okay, okay. Phew.

384
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,458
I... I just gotta figure out how to hold on.

385
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,875
- Soda?
- [Soda] Elmer!

386
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,833
Take me to the island with the dragon.
Please?

387
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,708
[Soda holding in laugh]

388
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,833
[laughs]

389
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,541
- Soda!
- Yes, yes, Cat?

390
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,041
Better get going as fast as you can.

391
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,583
[laughs] Yee-haw!

392
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,208
[Elmer] Or slow! Slow's okay too!

393
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,416
Woo! Have a good time. Bye!

394
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,166
[chuckles]

395
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,166
He's such a good kid.
Hope he doesn't drown or get eaten.

396
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,083
Or both.

397
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,333
[majestic music plays]

398
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,625
Soda, slow down!
I got nothing to hold on to!

399
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,291
But I promised the cat I'd go fast.
[mimics car engine revving]

400
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,250
- Okay, but just not <i>so</i> fast.
- [giggles]

401
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,333
Medium fast. Good, good. I can do that.

402
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,541
Woo-hoo!

403
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,250
Wanna see why I'm called Soda?
Wanna see, wanna see?

404
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,625
- Nope. Not real...
- [shrieks]

405
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,625
[Soda laughs]

406
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,958
- Did you see it? Did you?
- [panting]

407
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,875
Yeah, yeah, I saw.

408
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,375
[Soda laughs]
I taught myself how to do that.

409
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,833
- Great, Soda. [sighs]
- I made the whole thing up all by myself.

410

[seagulls squawking]

412
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,250
- Wow.
- [Soda] It's something, isn't it?

413
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
I love dusk.

414
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,083
One night, I wanna swim
all the way to the stars.

415
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,666
Elmer! Elmer! Elmer!

416
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,750
Are you awake?

417
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,166
You're awake, right? You snore.

418
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,416
[laughs] Did you know that?

419
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,541
Or maybe that was your tummy.
Does it talk when it's hungry?

420
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,916
Hungry? Want something orangey?
'Cause it's almost morning, you know?

421
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,333
We're in the middle of a sea.
Where are we gonna get... [groans]

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,041
A tangerine?

423
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,625
Ta-da!

424
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,250
Whoa!

425
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,625
This is Tangerina.

426
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,291
Pretty spectacular, right?

427
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,208
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

428
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,000
[Soda] Best tangerines in town.

429
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,125
Or, I mean, on the water.

430
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,208
Best tangerines you'll ever taste.
That's for sure.

431
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,375
Last stop till the island, so stock up.

[cheerful music plays]

433
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,083

- Right?

[Soda mimics

435
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,083

438
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,083
Look! It's just like yours!
Look quickly before it pops!

439
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,250
[Elmer] Not bad. Not bad.

440
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,958
[Soda] Thanks!
Taught myself that one. No big deal.

[suspenseful music plays]

442
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,041
[Elmer] Wow!

443
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,416
- That must be it.
- [Soda] Yep.

444
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,833
That's Wild Island.

00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,333
[thunder rumbling]

446
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,791
Did you say <i>Wild</i> Island?

447
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,458
Yeah, 'cause of the wild animals.

448
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,875
Wild animals?

449
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:25,541
Yes. They have really big poky teeth
and poky claws.

450
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,458
What?

451
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,583
- Yep.
- Wait.

452
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,250
They captured the dragon,

453
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,958
so it can lift up the island
over and over again.

454
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,833
- Why would anyone do that?
- 'Cause it's sinking.

455
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:38,750
- So this is a rescue?
- Didn't the cat tell you any of this?

456
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,416
No!

457
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,666
Well, surprise!

458
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,583

Hey, stop! I said knock it off!

I can hardly hear Saiwa
with all your racket.

497
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,166
Saiwa has made
the dragon save us once again,

498
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,166
and this is how you show gratitude?

Quiet down now.
There is no need to be afraid.

501
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,958
I brought this dragon to us,

502
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,458
and as long as he lifts us up,

503
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,041
we will never be lost to the sea.

I have the answers.
I will save Wild Island.

[monkey 1] I can't take it.

510
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,625
Saiwa's dragon is barely able
to lift the island now.

511
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,458
Listen to him. Just listen.

512

Each time, we lose more ground.
I lost my home this time.

513

The most important thing
is that we all keep calm.

You could drown next!

[screams]

518
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,458
Shut up, Tamir!

519
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:14,541
[monkey 3] Kwan?

520
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,208
Yes, Saiwa?

521
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,666
Give him to me.

522
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,416

- Shush!

00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,875
Stop it. Stop it!

526
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,833
[groans] I don't wanna drown.
I don't wanna drown.

527

- [screams]
- Tamir, Tamir, Tamir!

528
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,166
Listen to me. You are scaring everyone.

529
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,375
I'm sorry, Saiwa.
I... I just don't wanna drown.

530
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,083
I don't wanna drown!
I don't wanna drown! I...

531
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,000
- [animals chattering]
- Be calm. You are all safe.

532
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,000
Be quiet!

533
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,708
Let Saiwa speak.

534
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,833
[tense music plays]

535
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:52,083
If we surrender to panic,
I cannot save you.

536
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,208
No one can.

537
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,666
[screams]

538
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,166
Please, I simply ask you to trust me.

[grunts, pants]

540
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:02,916
The dragon...

541
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,208
The dragon does what I make him do,

542
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:08,500
and so should you
when I tell you to stop...

543
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,166
- But, but...
- But what?

544

552
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,791
Let go! Let go!

[Saiwa] Kwan!

556
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,375
Bring him down. We can't lose the dragon.

557
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,541
[grunts]

[Elmer screams]

559
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:50,541
Bring the Howlers.
We will track him and the child.

560
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:55,708
This is not the time for panic.
We will recapture our dragon.

561
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,708
But he'll hide.

562
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,833
No. They can't hide from me.

563
00:29:58,916 --> 00:29:59,916
Huh.

Yeah!

574
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,666
I... I did it!

575
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,166
I actually saved an amazing,
spectacular, real live, fire-breathing...

576
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,625
[laughs]

577
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,625

Oh, ah, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ow. Ow. Ow.

580
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,625
I... I mean you no harm, dragon.

- [loud thump]
- [dragon] Ow.

585
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,083
[chuckles] I think I hurt myself.

[exhales]

587
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,791
Oh, you rescued me!

588
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,291
- Ooh!
- It's my lucky day.

589
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:26,125
I'm so lucky I could explode!
Hold... hold still so I can thank you.

590
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,916
[gasps, screams]

591
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:33,125
- [gasps]
- What's the matter? You not a hugger?

592
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,625
Too cool for a public display
of affection?

593
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,708
Yeah, me too.

594
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,666
- Are you for real?
- [laughs]

595
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,583
Of course I'm real.
If I was made up, could I do this?

No. [sighs]

What do you think?

600
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,458
- This is not good.
- It's a work in progress.

601
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,333
[grunts, sighs]

602
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,291
[sighs]

603
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,625
Okay. Yeah, I... I can make this work.

604
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,291
All right. [clears throat]

605
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,125
Dragon, I rescued you,
so you owe me something in return.

606
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,208
Right?

607
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,125
I would lay down my life for you.

608
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,416
No, you don't have to do...

609
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,416
- Ooh.
- I would dry up oceans with fire

610
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,041
and destroy mountains
with my roar for you.

611
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:27,458
That's oka... Wait, you can do that?

612
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,291
No. [laughs]

613
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:30,625
Not at all, really.

614
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,541
I get dizzy around large bodies of water,
and I'm afraid of fire.

615
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:39,000
It can really hurt. Ow. Ow.

616
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,625
This is what hurts right now. Ow.
How many wings am I holding up?

617
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,750
One, but the other wing looks
kinda floppy.

618
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,250
This is the thanks I get
for lifting the island over and over?

619
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,750
I told them it doesn't work.

620
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,083
Because if it did,
I'd already be an After Dragon.

621
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:56,041
- What?
- An After Dragon.

622
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,291
It's only the best thing... ever.

623
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:00,208
- Here, come with me.
- No, no!

624
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,333
[both scream]

625
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,000
- [Elmer screams]
- [groans]

626
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,291
Ow. Ooh. Ooh. That hurt even more.

627
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,041
Boy, where are you?

628
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,416
[muffled grunts, gasps]

629
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,000
- Oh gosh.
- [coughs]

630
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,125
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Why did you...

631
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,833
I was trying to fly,
but my wing, it's just not working.

632
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,500
[sighs] Great. This is great.

633
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,166
I'm stuck on an island full
of wild animals with poky teeth.

634
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,375
I just saved a dragon who can't fly?

635
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,458
Uh-huh.

636
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,458
- Who's afraid of water?
- Uh-huh.

637
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:36,041
Has a fear of fire?

638
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:37,708
Uh-huh.

639
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,750
But dragons breathe fire.

640
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:40,958
Not me.

641
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,708
Can you do anything?

642
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,875
[gasps] I can do this.

643
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:47,083
[armpit smacking]

644
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,541
Hold on. Hold on.

645
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,000
Wait. I'm usually
a lot sweatier than this.

646
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,500
- Okay, stop.
- [farts]

647
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,625
- Did you just...
- That was... my armpit.

648
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,458
Look over here.
It's that thing I wanted to show you.

649
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,333
That's what I'll look like
after I get my fire.

650
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,291
When I save the island.

651
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:08,916
See?

652
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,750
Not really.

653
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:14,875
[dragon] Well, dragons have been coming
to Wild Island for thousands of years.

654
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:19,625
Because when we turn 100,
which is only 100 divided by

655
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:21,916
ten in human boy years, which is...

656
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,916
which is...

657
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:26,583
Uh...

658
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,666
Ten. It's ten!

659
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,416
Ten! I said it at the same time.
When we're ten years old,

660
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,250
we come here to Wild Island
to do a rite of passage,

661
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,333
like bees to a flower,
except for dragons, not bees.

662
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,416
And it's an island, not a flower.

663
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,750
We have to save Wild Island from sinking
'cause it sinks every 100 years.

664
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,583
If we can do that, we become After Dragons

665
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:54,333
who breathe fire and have muscles
and who are smart and brave like this.

666
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,125
[inhales, exhales]

667
00:34:57,208 --> 00:35:01,291
I'm pretty sure I'll look just like that
after I save the island and get my fire.

668
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,416
Wait. You already saved the island.
I saw you do it.

669
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,291
No. That's the way Saiwa made me do it.

670
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:09,000
But it can't be right
because it just sinks worse the next time.

671
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,166
And it's scary and fiery and bad up there.

672
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,333
So how are you supposed to do it?

673
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,500
I have... no idea.

674
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,750
- [sighs]
- [dragon] I'm just not an answer guy.

675
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,166
- [Elmer] It doesn't mean there isn't one.
- Nope.

676
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,041
- There must be a way to figure it out.
- None. Except for Aratuah.

677
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,125
- Who's that?
- He's a really old tortoise.

678
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,583
He was here when Horatio saved the island,
so he knows all about dragons.

679
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,166
He drew this muscly After Dragon.

680
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:36,583
- All right. Let's go ask him.
- Except I don't know where he is.

681
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,541
Aw, come on!

682
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,083
[dragon] When I landed on the island,
I looked for him,

683
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,958
and looked and looked
and looked and looked.

684
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,708
I thought maybe Aratuah would leave me
a sign or some kind of map

685
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,458
or something, right?

686
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:53,125
- Why are you making that face?
- I'll help you.

687
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,875
You'd do that for me?

688
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,541
- Yes.
- [cheers]

689
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,750
But after I help you become
an After Dragon, you'll help me.

690
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,166
Of course. [laughs]

691
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,833
We'll come back to Nevergreen
and be in my dragon show.

692
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:07,375
Except that after my rite of passage,
I'm supposed to go home.

693
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,833
It's gonna be awesome.

694
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:13,791
All my family will fly up to see me,
and I'll blow fire, and they'll all cheer.

695
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:18,875
Okay. Well, I did rescue you,
and it doesn't have to be forever.

696
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,708
I just need you to help me
earn enough money for my store.

697
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,500
- Do we have a deal?
- Okay. Sounds good.

698
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,458
[dragon licks]

699
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,166
[cheers, laughs]

700
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,250
Uh, okay.

701
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,875
I'm gonna call you... Answer Guy.

702
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,958
- Elmer. My name is Elmer.
- [gasps]

703
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,541
Of course you have a cool name like that.

704
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:42,166
My name's Boris. Not as cool,
but it goes with my face. [chuckles]

705
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:43,916
I lied to you, Elmer.

706
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,583
- That fart didn't come from my armpit.
- I don't wanna know.

707
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,708
[monkey howling]

708
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,416

709
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,416
[howling]

710
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,666
They're on foot.

711
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,375
The dragon's wing must be badly wounded.

712
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,333
Badly wounded?

713
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,708
[Tamir yelps]

714
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:15,875
Oh no!

715
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,666
It's a catastrophe!
We're gonna... No, no! [screams]

716
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,625
Saiwa, how can you stand
that runt in your ear?

717
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,625
- Cut him loose.
- Who you calling a runt?

718
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,833
I won't cut him loose.
He'll cause panic. You know that, Kwan.

719
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,750
[Kwan grunts]

720
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,416
What if we're squandering our chance
to leave a doomed island?

721
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,958
Now, now. [shushes]

722
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,791
Saiwa! [chuckles]

723
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,500
He's close.

724
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,291
[monkeys howling]

725
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:44,041
[Boris] My brother Horatio
taught me to spit really far,

726
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,416
and I bet I could hit that tree.
Do you wanna see? Elmer?

727
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,208
- Uh, can you keep an eye out for arrows?
- Okay.

728
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:54,791
I'm actually really hungry right now.
Skunk cabbage is my favorite.

729
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,958
You don't suppose there are any
around here? There's an arrow!

730
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,791
Nope. Nope. There's an arrow!
No, no, no, sorry. False alarm.

731
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,000
Hey, you know what?

732
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,541
- I'll be the arrow finder, okay?
- Sure.

733
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,250
Just be quiet so I can concentrate.

734
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,916
[upbeat music plays]

735
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,708
[Boris] Oh my gosh.

736
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,291
[Boris laughs]

737
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,750
It's a whole little world of strawberry!

738
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:20,750
[both grunt]

739
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,791
Do not touch the stuff
in my backpack. Got it?

740
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,125
- Really?
- I mean it.

741
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,041
- Okay.
- [insects chirping]

742
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:29,958
Why?

743
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,083
- 'Cause I need everything in here.
- Why?

744
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:34,458
- 'Cause I do.
- So it's very important?

745
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,958
- Yes!
- More important than that arrow?

746
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
[Elmer] Oh!

747
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,791
Okay. Great. This way.

748
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,750
Yeah! Aratuah, here we come.

749
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:47,916
- [howling]
- Huh?

750
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,291
[Elmer gasps]

751
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:54,583
What was that?

752
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,000
- Uh, Saiwa's coming after us!
- Coming after us?

753
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:02,375
He's coming after us! [screams]

754
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,291
[water raging]

755
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,750
We can get across here.

756
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,250
Uh...

757
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:09,708
Elmer?

758
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:13,291
Remember when I said...
that water makes me dizzy?

759
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:17,333
Come on, Boris. I don't wanna
get eaten by anyone with poky claws

760
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,625
- or poky... teeth!
- [crocodile gargles]

[crocodile and Elmer grunt]

762
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,916
- Crocodiles!
- And water. Don't forget the water.

[Saiwa howling]

764
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,250
And Saiwa's coming! I can't go back.

765
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:39,333
It's so scary up there at the summit.
All the fire. It'll burn me up!

766
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,416
They won't get you. I'll make sure of it.

767
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Wow, I like that answer.
Nothing's gonna stop us.

[crocodile growls, gargles]

769
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,708
Except maybe him!

773
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,583
What do you think you're doing, dragon?

- [grunts]
- [crocodiles giggle]

775
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,500
Douglas, Winifred,
you get back here right now.

776
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:11,333
[mumbles] Children! It's not safe,
you naughty little reptiles.

[crocodile straining]

778
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,541
Ease up, will you?

779
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:18,291
You're squeezing the life out of me.

780
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,458
[grunts] This is all your fault, dragon.

781
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,958
What do you think you're doing,
swanning about down here?

782
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:27,083
This isn't exactly swanning!

783
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,458
- What in the world is this thing?
- [yelps]

784
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,583
That's an Elmer.

785
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:34,333
He's the answer guy.
He's gonna help me save the island.

786
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:35,958
Quickly, this way!

787
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,833
[scoffs] You? Save Wild Island?

788
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:42,041
You're pulling my leg. [laughs]

789
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,916
- Hey! Stop pulling my leg!
- [crocodiles grunt]

790

We gotta... climb to the other side!

791
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,625
Now, where was I?

792
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,916
I'll snap you in two.

- [grunts] You dragon thief!
- [groans]

800
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,750
You have the wrong end
of the stick, crocodile!

801
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,458
My name is Cornelius. And I agree!

803

[Saiwa growls]

806
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:25,583
What's happening?

807
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,833
[wailing] Oh no. Come on, wee ones.

808
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:30,041
Quick. Here you go.
[muffled] Come on. Let's go.

00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,000
- Hurry, Boris!
- Have you got a better answer?

813
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,083
This one's not working so well for me.

815
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,291

- Come on, Boris!

818
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,541
Oh, no, I can't.

819
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,666
Saiwa, your dragon is here.

820
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,875
[Cornelius] He's here!

821
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,375
[Boris] Elmer!

822
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,541
- Look, Boris! It's all yours.
- [groans]

[laughs] Strawberry?

825
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Come and get it.

826
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,791
Strawberry is almost as tasty
as skunk cabbage.

827
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,708
- Get him!
- [Elmer] Look at me, Boris.

828
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,583
Boris, look at me.
You just gotta keep on going.

It stopped.

For now, but... it'll happen again

864
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:59,291
and again and again.

865
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,833
Let's keep moving, then.

866
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,291
[Boris] Got any more
of those strawberry things?

867
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:06,416
No. And paws off the backpack. Okay?

868
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,875
Well... I'm pretty sure I could go faster
if you showed me what's in there.

869
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:11,833
No.

870
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,083
Aw, come on.

871
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,958
[laughs]

872
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,666
Hey. [laughs]

873
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,750
Boris, stop!

874
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,375
Really? Why?

875
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,375
Look, I don't have time to explain.
The island is sinking. Remember?

876
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,333
Okay. [sighs]

877
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,083
Let's go.

878
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,791
[monkeys howling]

879
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:38,291
[Saiwa grunts]

880
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,375
[crocodiles whimper]

881
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:46,250
Oh, Douglas, Winifred, I was so worried.
Where's George? George! [groans]

882
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,333
[gasps] Am I alive? Am I alive?

883
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:50,958
[groans]

884
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:53,208
Alive. Most definitely alive.

885
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,541
- Hey! Cut it out! Stop it!
- [crocodiles whimper]

886
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:58,375
Oh, children, there you are.

887
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,416
Oh, thank you, Kwan.

888
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,541
- [Saiwa pants]
- Saiwa? Saiwa!

889
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,833
- It's sinking faster now.
- Oh, oh, now he's worried.

890
00:45:06,916 --> 00:45:08,166
- [grunts]
- [yelps]

891
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, not now, Kwan. Not now.

892
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:13,750
But I had the dragon. I had him.
Why did you make me turn back?

893
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,250
Listen. Listen to me.

894
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:19,375
The whole island will be gone
if we don't recapture that dragon!

895
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,583
[monkeys howl]

896
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:21,916
They all look to me.

897
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,583
Do you understand? To me.

898
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:28,000
[monkeys howl]

899
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,250
Someday, they will look to you.

900
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:34,000
- And you must not abandon them.
- But our home will be gone.

901
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:37,041
We still have time to capture our dragon.

902
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,708
Trust me.

903
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,666
[Boris whistles]

904
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,916

[Boris pants]

907
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,708
- Hey, buddy, what do you think?
- About what?

908
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,708
[whistles, pants]

909
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:00,291
It's... um, nice?

910
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,833
Great! That could be
our secret friendship whistle.

911
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:07,333
- You know, 'cause we're friends now.
- I'm not really a whistler.

912
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:10,583
Are you kidding me?
What if you meet another wild animal,

913
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:13,958
or I hurt my other wing
or see a Howler or Kwan or Saiwa?

914
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:18,166
- How are we supposed to call each other?
- By saying "help"?

915
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,291
Oh, come on! Anyone can do that.

916
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,958
You don't even have to be
friends or anything.

917
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:27,958

920
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,791
- [laughs]
- Not funny!

921
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:36,875
[grunts]

922
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:38,666
Are you scared?

923
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,041
No! I am cautious. There is a difference.

924
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,416
[laughs]

925
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,458
- Where did you get that scarf?
- [laughs] It's so soft.

926
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:51,166
It feels really good against my skin.
Go on. Give it a feel.

927
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:53,458
Boris.

928
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,291
[tiger growls]

929
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:58,375
It's not really a soft scarf, is it?

930
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,291
Uh...

931
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,541
- [glows]
- [screams]

932
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,125
[Boris and Elmer yelp]

933
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:05,500
- George, look who it is!
- [Elmer groans]

934
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,916
No. [scoffs]

935
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
No way. You're messing with me.

936
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,708
- [growls]
- [screams]

937

- [tigers purr]
- [Boris screams]

938
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,375
Elmer? I'm feeling really cautious.

939
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,791
[grunts]

940
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,708
I'm going to be a hero!

941
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:22,666
- [Boris pants]
- I captured Saiwa's dragon for him.

942
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,666
Well, <i>we</i> captured him.

943
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,166
- [tiger growl]
- [Boris wails]

944
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,791
- [groans]
- What's this thing?

945
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,666
It looks sweet and chewy.

946
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:33,250
Sasha, give it here.
I'll take the first bite.

947
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,916
And I'll take the dragon to Saiwa.

948
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,750
- Hey! No, you don't. I'll take it.
- [gasps]

949

- [growls]
- [Elmer screams]

951
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:47,208
You look just like a sweet, juicy melon

952
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:50,250
with bits of hair stuck to you. [growls]

953
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:54,000
[screams]

954
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,083
Stop it, Sasha.

955
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,250
[Elmer screams]

956
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,208
- Sasha.
- [growls]

957

[screams] Help!

960
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:05,250
He's mine!

961
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,625
No! That sweet little morsel is mine!

962
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,166
- [growls]
- [screams]

963
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,375
Wait! I have something sweet!

964
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:12,708
Obviously.

965
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:16,125
No, no, much sweeter.
Cinnamon-flavored bubble gum!

966
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,333
[tigers screeching]

967
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:22,375
Every chew releases a whole new burst
of mouthwatering sweetness!

968
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,958
You've not tasted anything like it before,

969
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:28,916
and it will be the... the highlight
of your entire existence.

970
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,958
It comes from a little town far away,
and... it tastes like home.

971
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,041
- Oooh.
- Yum.

972
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:36,458
- Oh, yes. Give me! Give it!
- I want some!

973
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,416
- Mine!
- Mine!

974
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,583
[George] Mine!

975
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,666
I've only got one,
so you're gonna have to fight for it!

00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,833
[tigers hissing]

Elmer?

980
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,000
Boris!

[Tamir] Sinking, sinking.

984
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:10,625
Every morning,
every night, sinking, sinking!

985
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:12,875
- [echoes] Sinking.
- [Boris pants]

[whistles]

990
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,208
What is it, Boris?

991
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,666
I'm calling you. [whistles]

992
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,750
- Yes, I get it, but what do you want?
- Okay, good.

993
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,625
I gotta stop and catch my breath. [groans]

994
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,916
- Not a good idea.
- I'm a better flier... than a walker.

995
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,708
The sooner we find Aratuah,
the sooner we get out of here.

996
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:41,666
[pants, talks indistinctly]

997
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,833
What?

998
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:46,375
[pants] You know, you said no more stuff
from the backpack,

999
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,166
but you gave those tigers
that cinnamon-flavored bubble gum,

1000
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,083
so is the new rule "no stuff from
the backpack unless we're gonna die?"

1001
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:54,000
[sighs]

1002
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,750
Sounds like you got your breath back,
so let's go.

1003
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,291
Okay. Is Neverblue your home?

1004
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:02,250
[Elmer] Nevergreen.
It's called Nevergreen.

1005
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,458
It's just a place where I live,
but it's not my home.

1006
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I used to have a store with my mom.

1007
00:50:08,083 --> 00:50:10,791
- So that's your home, then?
- Uh, no, not anymore.

1008
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,375
- Then where's your home?
- I don't have one right now.

1009
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:16,041
But I will when I set up the store.

1010
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,041
- That you had.
- No. A new one.

1011
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:20,583
Oh, so this store's gonna
be different 'cause it's new?

1012
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,750
No, it's... it's gonna be the...

1013
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,041
[screams]...same!

Elmer, are you okay?

1017
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:34,333
[hesitates] Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
Just be careful where you stand.

1018
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,125
Somebody set this trap.

1019
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,208
What?

1020
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,375
[mice screeching]

1021
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,416
Oh my gosh.

1022
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,500
Elmer, you've gotta see this.

1023
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,000
There are so many
cute little furry mouse things.

1024
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:50,750
Hello!

1025
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:54,916
[giggles] What? Oh, I get it.

1026
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,958
Yeah, it's a trap for me. [laughs]

1027
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:02,416
- You gotta get me out of here!
- Don't worry. I know what to do.

1028
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,958
Throw me your backpack, sweater,
shirt, pants. Everything.

1029
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:09,166
Good idea.
We can tie a rope out of my clothes.

1030
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,833
Oh. Yeah. That's probably better.

1031
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:15,000
- Wait, what was your plan?
- Doesn't matter. We can try it your way.

1032
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,541

00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,000
[rhino growls]

1037
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,125
Boris.

1038
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,208
Here's a stick. Grab on.

1039
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,375
[grunts]

1040
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:31,333
- I can't reach it, Boris! I gotta get out!
- Okay.

1041
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,333
[giggles]

1042
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,833
- [Elmer grunts]
- [Rhino growls]

1043
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:38,041
- Boris, you gotta help!
- [Boris] Just a second!

1044
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:41,375
[giggles]

1045
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:42,708
- Boris?
- [rhino bellowing]

1046
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:44,916
[growling]

1047
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
[gasps, pants]

1048
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,208
- [rhino bellowing]
- [yelps]

1049
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:54,833
- [rhino bellowing]

1050
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,250
- [Elmer grunts]
- [Rhino growls]

1051
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,291
Elmer! Elmer?

1052
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,791
[rhino bellowing]

1053
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:04,875
[Boris] Elmer!

1054
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,750
[rhino crying]

1055
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,291
[Boris] Elmer!

1056
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,458
- Answer me!
- Don't come down, Boris.

1057
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:17,166
It's... useless. It's useless.

1058
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,416
- [pants]
- You're just scared.

1059
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,833
- [pants]
- Don't worry. It's going to be okay.

1060
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:24,791
Get real.

1061
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:29,000
We are in a hole on a sinking island.

1062
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:32,708
It's not gonna be okay. [crying]

1063
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:36,750
- [sobs]
- [whimpers]

1064
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:38,416
[rhino] I know you're hungry.

1065
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,791
I'll get you something. I promise.

1066
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,083
Does... he like tangerines?

1067
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,666
You got tangerines?

1068
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,250
- My baby loves tangerines.
- [baby rhino chuckles]

1069
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,625
- Here you go. [chuckles]
- [gulps]

1070
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,583
- My name's Iris.
- I'm Elmer.

1071
00:52:56,166 --> 00:52:58,583
You're the boy who took Saiwa's dragon.

1072
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:03,541
They made this trap for you,
but I fell in with my baby.

1073
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:04,625
I... I'm sorry.

1074
00:53:04,666 --> 00:53:08,291
Why did you do it?
Why did you take the dragon?

1075
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,916
- He needed to be rescued.
- But who's gonna rescue us?

1076
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,041
Saiwa, he had a way of keeping us safe.

1077
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,666
If that was true, the island would've been
safe for a hundred years,

1078
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,750
and Boris would be an After Dragon.
Don't you see?

1079
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:25,958
- I just want it to be okay again.
- [squeals]

1080
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:27,625
It will be.

1081
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,250
I'm taking Boris to Aratuah
to find the real answer.

1082
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,125
And we'll be safe then?

1083
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:35,000
I'm sure of it.

1084
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:38,041
Well, that would be such a relief,

1085
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,291
if we weren't trapped
in a hole with no way out.

1086
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,625
- Boris is up there. He can help...
- [grunts]

1087
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
[sighs]

1088
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,041
[gasps] Get away from him!

1089
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,583
Whoa, a baby! Ha, you little coochie coo.

1090
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,500
- Boris! You jumped in.
- Of course. I had to help my friend.

1091
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:59,791
- [baby rhino chuckles]
- But... how are we gonna get out?

1092
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,833
[mice screeching]

1093
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:06,791
[Saiwa howling]

1094
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,166
[inhales, exhales]

1095
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,458
- [baby rhino grunts]
- [suspenseful music plays]

1096
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,208
[monkeys grunt]

1097
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:17,416
Hey, hey! Stop fighting!

1098
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,958
Stop! Let go!
Saiwa, there's something down here.

1099
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,875
[Tamir mumbles]

1100
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,083
Calm down, Tamir.

1101
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:28,416
- Saiwa says calm down! Calm down!
- Everybody, shut up!

1102
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:32,125
Dragon... you can come out.

1103
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,541
You won't be harmed.

1104
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,833
I promise.

1105
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,625
- It's only me, Saiwa. Me and my baby.
- [bellowing]

1106
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:49,833
Iris?

1107
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,458
- Come on, Saiwa.
- Wait, Kwan.

1108
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,583
- Let's keep moving.
- We have to get them out.

1109
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,875
- [growls]
- [mice screeching]

1110
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,708
Can't you stop them fighting?

1111
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,458
Hush. Hush now.

1112
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,500
Hold on, Iris. We'll get you out.

1113
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,166
[grunts]

1114
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:08,833
[suspenseful music intensifies]

1115
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,416
Wait, wait, wait!

1116
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,166
- What is it?
- I... I heard them, Saiwa.

1117
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,750
The dragon and the boy.

1118
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:19,166
[hesitates] The boy said
he was taking the dragon to the summit.

1119
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,750
That doesn't make sense.
The dragon hates it there.

1120
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:25,791
The boy doesn't want to drown.
None of us do, Saiwa.

1121
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,750
If anyone can help him now, it's you.

1122
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,625
- Just you.
- [animals chattering]

1123
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,708
- Let's go to the summit!
- We have to get her out first.

1124
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:36,541
We could sink at any second.
We don't have time.

1125
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,833
Kwan!

1126
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,541
No, it's okay.

1127
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,041
See?

1128
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,625
We'll be all right, Iris.

1129
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,833
- Howlers, come.
- [Tamir screams]

1130
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,708
- [monkeys howl]
- [mice screeching]

1131
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,583
[sighs]

1132
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:58,583
They're gone.

1133
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,500
That was very brave.

1134
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,916
Thank you, Iris.

1135
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,958
Elmer, Saiwa has forbidden
all the animals from going there...

1136
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,500
[whispers]...but I know where Aratuah is.

1137
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,583
[Iris] <i>I hope you find the answer,
for all our sakes.</i>

1138
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,041
<i>You're on your own from here.</i>

1139
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,750
[pants] Uh...

1140
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,458
Don't worry. I'll go first.

1141
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:28,958
Okay. Sure.

1142
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,916
[Elmer] Are you all right, Boris?

1143
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,958
Yeah. It's just I'm nervous,
anxious, scared,

1144
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,166
and I got that dizzy thing going on.

1145
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,083
- [grunts]
- [whispers] Sorry.

1146
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:48,875
That must be him.

1147
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:51,583
[tense music plays]

1148
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:57,375
- I'm gonna faint. [pants]
- Breathe. Just don't forget to breathe.

1149
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,416
[exhales]

1150
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,458
[yelps]

1151
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,333
[Boris groans, pants]

1152
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:10,083
Uh, can you ask him?
Just ask him for me, will ya?

1153
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,625
[Elmer grunts]

1154
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,541
[pants] Okay.

1155
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:15,916
[exhales]

1156
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:18,208
Ancient Aratuah?

1157
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,041
We've come to ask you,

1158
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,791
how is a dragon supposed
to save Wild Island?

1159
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:28,750
- [whispers] And fix my wing.
- And fix... Boris's wing?

1160
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:32,166
If... that's something that you do.

1161
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,625
[tense music continues]

1162
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:39,666
Uh, Boris is the dragon
who has come to save the island.

1163
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,083
[whispers] Ask about my fire.

1164
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:45,041
Can you... tell the dragon Boris
how to get his fire?

1165
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:48,458
Even if it's like a... a riddle or a...

1166
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,250
- Puzzle?
- No. Uh...

1167
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,958
[hesitates] Like... like a task we need
to do first or... or something.

1168
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:57,000
It's just... that we don't have much time.

1169
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:01,708
Uh, Aratuah?

1170
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:04,791
Ancient Aratuah?

1171
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,000
What if that's his...

1172
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,208
Oh.

1173
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,750
Yeah. Right.

1174
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,583
- [laughs] It was his butt.
- Shh.

1175
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,000
- [giggles]
- Aratuah?

1176
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,750
[giggles]

1177
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,833
- You know what? You try.
- What? No.

1178
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,500
- Just tell him.
- I can't.

1179
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,666
- Elmer! [screams]
- [grunts] Just do it. Just go!

1180
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,750
[both grunt]

1181
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,208
Uh...

1182
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,375
[cracking]

1183
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:37,958
Is that supposed to happen?

1184
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:39,583
Wait a second, Boris.

1185
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,875
[Boris] Elmer? Aratuah?

1186
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,416
We've been looking for so long.

1187
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,375
Aratuah!

1188
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,000
[gasps, pants]

1189
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:53,041
What did he say? Elmer, what did he say?
Can I see? Can I see him?

1190
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,833
- No. Don't go in there. No.
- Come on, let me see.

1191
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:57,958
- I wanna... Aratuah!
- Stop. Don't go in there.

1192
00:58:58,041 --> 00:59:00,500
Sorry about cracking your shell.
It was an accident.

1193
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:01,583
- No! Stop!
- Aratuah!

1194
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,625
He's dead!

1195
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:04,125
[gasps]

1196
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,083
He's dead?

1197
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,291
What do I do now, Elmer?

1198
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,958
I... I... I...

1199
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,875
- [rocks crumbling]
- [gasps]

1200
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,166
Come on, Boris.

1201
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:22,958
We gotta go!

1202
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,375
[sad music playing]

1203
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,375

[Boris grunts]

1208
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,375
Boris? Are you okay?

1209
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:55,458
I just need to lie down someplace warm.

1210
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,125
I'll look after you.

1211
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,208
[Iris] Elmer?

1212
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,583
You spoke to Aratuah?
You know how to save us?

1213
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,958
[baby rhino squeals]

1214
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:05,708
We... we did.

1215
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:08,333
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- [baby rhino chuckles]

1216
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,875
Yeah, but before he can do
his rite of passage,

1217
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:15,375
Boris just... He needs to rest, you know?

1218
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:18,333
Oh, of course. Of course.
I know just the place.

1219
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,666
[sad music continues]

1220
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,958
Right at the top is safe and dry.

1221
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,375
- You can rest there.
- Thank you, Iris.

1222
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:48,750
No, no, no. Thank you... so much.

1223
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:50,083
[baby rhino chuckles]

1224
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,208
[Elmer] You must be hungry.

1225
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,083
You said it's not for sharing.

1226
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,083
[sighs] Forget what I said.

1227
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:19,500
Just... help yourself.

1228
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,166
That's what I used
to free you from the vines.

1229
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,875
That helped me see Iris in the pit.

1230
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:42,833
Do you like... tangerines, Boris?

1231
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,583
Tangerines?

1232
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
[chuckles]

1233
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:56,458
No, no, that's for you.

1234
01:01:56,541 --> 01:01:59,583
[slurps]

1235
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:02,958
You eat just the peel
and not the fleshy part?

1236
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:05,666
Of course not. [slurps]

1237
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,125
Then this is gonna work out just fine.

1238
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:12,375
I forgot how good they taste. [laughs]

1239
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:15,958
[Boris sniffs]

1240
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:19,666
My brother Horatio brought me
tangerines home

1241
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,875
when he became an After Dragon.

1242
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:26,041
I could hear his whistle...
in the sky over Blueland.

1243
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,416
Everyone was so proud.

1244
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:32,125
No one's ever going to be proud of me.

1245
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,375
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

1246
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:43,791
I'm kind of relieved that I'm not expected
to do anything now

1247
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:47,291
because the truth is
I couldn't do it anyway.

1248
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:49,166
[sniffs]

1249
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,625
That's what I really feel
in the pit of my stomach.

1250
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:56,041
I bet you'd be
a great After Dragon, Boris.

1251
01:02:56,125 --> 01:03:01,541
You always know what to do, Elmer.
You don't seem to be scared of anything.

1252
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,041
Well, I...

1253
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:05,083
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1254
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:08,916
I'd be burned up at the summit
or drowned in the sea.

1255
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,791
You're right. I'm not scared of anything.

1256
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,250
Just rest.

1257
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:18,666
When you wake up, I'll have the answer.

1258
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:21,250
This really was my lucky day.

1259
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,458
And tomorrow's gonna be even luckier.

<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

1268
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Elmer.

1269
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,541
Mom?

1270
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,916
I'm so sorry, Elmer.

1271
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,333
- For what?
- He made me tell him where you were.

1272
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:03,208
- [whimpers]
- I had to protect my baby.

1273
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,625
[Kwan] So it's true.

1274
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:06,625
- Boris!
- [Boris] I'm up.

1275
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:08,375
- Boris, get up!
- I'm up!

1276
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:11,625
Look at all the trouble
you have caused us,

1277
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,791
you worthless thing!

1278
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:16,000
Stay away from us, Kwan. [gasps]

1279
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:19,041
- Boris, stop!
- You're coming with me!

1280
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,291
Tell him, Boris,

1281
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:24,291
that you spoke to Aratuah,
that you know how to save the island.

1282
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,916
You spoke to Aratuah?

1283
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:30,458
He told us the real answer, not Saiwa's.

1284
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,166
[scoffs]

1285
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,333
Then he can stop all of this.

1286
01:05:35,916 --> 01:05:37,666
[Saiwa] No, he cannot.

1287
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:39,791
Isn't that right, dragon?

1288
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,375
[hesitates] Elmer? Please help.

1289
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:46,708
Aratuah did not help him
because he's dead.

1290
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,291
- Dead?
- Dead?

1291
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:50,125
- [howling]
- Elmer.

1292
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,625
- I... I...
- How could you?

1293
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,291
Do you remember the day
you came here, dragon?

1294
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,625
You had no idea how to save this island.

1295
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:03,250
I helped you do
what you knew you could not.

1296
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,500
Please, Elmer.

1297
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,541
Now all you have to do
is come with me now.

1298
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,250
- We will save the island again.
- I don't wanna go back...

1299
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,416
Together.

1300
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,916
- I can't.
- Leave him alone!

1301
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,375
Ok, quiet, boy!
He's our dragon, not yours.

1302

[gasps, groans]

1303

- That can't be right.

1376
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:42,000
You're doing it!
Come on, just a little more!

1381
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:57,250
Boris? Boris, what's wrong?

1382
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:59,458
Are you okay? You've gotta lift.

1383
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:01,333
- Lift!
- I have the answer.

1384
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:04,125
[electrical crackling]

1385
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,583
[screams] Come on! Lift! Lift!

1386
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:08,541
- You can't be here, Elmer.
- What?

1387
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:11,250
- I have to let you down.
- No, no, no! Boris, please!

[tense music plays]

1389
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:15,833
Please! Come on!

1399
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:09,458
Quick, untie me.

1400
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,958
Boris, we have to get out of here.

1401
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,666
- But I understand now.
- Hold still, Boris.

1402
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:19,666
We were flying and you said I could do it,
and I believed it for the first time.

1403
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,333
- Hold still, or I can't cut you free.
- I could feel it in the pit of my stomach.

1404
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,750
We don't have time now.
The island is done for.

1405
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:28,500
Listen, it didn't work
because you don't have the answer.

1406
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:29,750
- Stop!
- I do.

1407
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:32,250
- No! Just stop!
- I have to go in there.

1411
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:45,416
I have to do it on my own.

1412
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,833
No! You know what will happen. Just stop!

1413
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:53,375
- I can't stop!
- You'll burn up in there.

1414
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:56,291
- You're wrong.
- Listen, I can help. Just let me help.

1415
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,916
- Just stop, Boris. Stop.
- No. I've gotta go. Just let me go!

1416
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:03,916
You'll never be an After Dragon!

01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,166
Come on.

1420
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,500
Leave me alone.

1421
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:19,291
No! Because I have to get us out
of this mess!

1422
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,875
I said leave me alone!

1423

Saiwa?

1434
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:19,583
Hey! Shh! Leave him alone.
He has to find fresh water, shelter, food,

1435
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:22,375
you know, little stuff like that
so we don't die.

1436
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,208
I... I might have something left for you.

1437
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:29,875
[Saiwa] We don't need anything from you.

1438
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:32,125
- I was trying to...

[baby rhino whimpers]

1440
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:37,208
I... I thought I could help.

1441
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:38,750
Help?

1442
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:42,125
I... helped.

1443
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:47,291
When the island started sinking,
I went to Aratuah, but he was gone.

1444
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,875
I knew fear would drown us
long before the sea,

1445
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:54,583
so... I kept the truth from them.

1446
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,541
And when the dragon came,
we thought we were saved.

1447
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:02,875
But he was foolish... and frightened.

1448
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:06,500
Don't say that. He pulled
the island up for you over and over.

1449
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:10,500
I used him, yes, to keep us safe.

1450
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:12,541
- [groans]
- What did you use him for?

1451
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:14,791
I... I didn't. I'm his friend.

1452
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:19,000
Oh. I see. [laughs]

1453
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:21,666
He thought you were his friend.

1454
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,041
- I...
- [Saiwa laughs]

1455
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:26,875
Foolish.

1456
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,750
And frightened.

[crying] I'm sorry, Boris.

1471
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:42,000
No. You were right. I can't do it, Elmer.

1472
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,791
I can't save anyone.

1473
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:47,208
I can't do anything.

1474
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,666
I'm too scared.

[breathing heavily]

1476
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,125
[Elmer] I get scared too.

1477
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,541
I get scared all the time.

1478
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,000
I try to figure everything out,
but I can't.

1479
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,916
You?

1480
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,583
[sniffs] Go get your fire.

1481
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,833
And I'll be here for you
when you get back.

You know, these After Dragon drawings,
they're not very realistic, are they?

01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:56,500
I think there's a resemblance.

Yeah?

1537
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:24,666
Aw.

1538
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,708
- [chuckles]

[sad music playing]

1540
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:36,291
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1541
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,958
I thought I had the answer.

1542
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,791
I had nothing.

1543
01:23:44,166 --> 01:23:45,291
I am sorry.

1544
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,708
You know what Wild Island needs now?

1545
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:52,291
It needs you,

1546
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,958
all of you, to tell my story.

1547
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:57,875
Draw it up here

1548
01:23:58,458 --> 01:23:59,583
without the muscles.

1549
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:04,208
So when the island sinks again
in a hundred years

1550
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:06,250
and the next dragon comes,

1551
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:10,583
you're not gonna tie them up
