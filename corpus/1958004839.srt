00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,984
You're gonna kill a fuckin' cop?

363
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,824
Eventually.

364
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,189
That's the plan.

365
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,528
But first, I'm gonna
need some information.

366
00:29:58,235 --> 00:30:00,235
What you need
is to go fuck yourself.

367
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,238
- You motherfucker!
- [groans]

368
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:06,978
She didn't deserve to die.

369
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:09,508
Not like that.

370
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:12,544
And not by someone like you.

371
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:17,351
What the hell are you doing?

372
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:19,958
Oh, I'm gonna right
another wrong.

373
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,159
I'm a fucking cop!

374
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:26,327
- Do you hear me?
- You're a dirty cop!

375
00:30:27,063 --> 00:30:29,264
- [Moore groans]
- [gasoline splashes]

376
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,969
You're gonna fry!

377
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:36,139
You fuckin' hear me?
You're gonna fuckin' fry!

378
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,471
Fuck.

379
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:43,575
- Who sent you?
- [laughing]

380
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:47,117
I think you already know, buddy.

381
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,991
You have no idea

382
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:57,556
how badly I wanna
see you go up in flames.

383
00:30:57,591 --> 00:31:01,098
So this is your last chance.

384
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:04,101
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

385
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,498
Okay, just...

386
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,436
Just take it easy, okay?

387
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,571
It was Lars.

388
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:15,915
Lars.

389
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,214
It was Lars.

390
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,188
He wanted us to find out
who you were working for.

391
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:30,457
And if you couldn't?

392
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,462
The phone, front pocket.

393
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:37,970
He wanted me
to show you the video,

394
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:40,500
just in case you needed
some more convincing.

395
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:47,111
Wait. Wait!

396
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,080
Come on, man.

397
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:51,610
I told you what
you wanted to hear.

398
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,118
- Don't leave me like this,
- [lighter clinks]

399
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:55,680
they'll kill me if they find me.

400
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:57,957
Please.

401
00:32:00,027 --> 00:32:01,257
[clinks]

402
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,028
Fuck you!

403
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:08,264
[screaming]

404
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,299
You fucker!

405
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:13,203
[continues screaming]

406
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:19,341
[Trish on recording]<i> Dallas,</i>
<i>I opened the envelopes.</i>

407
00:32:19,376 --> 00:32:21,013
<i>Both envelopes.</i>

408
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,577
<i>This was never about money.</i>

409
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:29,615
<i>I know what we are up against.</i>

410
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,452
<i>I am here for you.</i>

411
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:32,992
<i>I care deeply.</i>

412
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:36,754
<i>Perhaps one day
you could share with me</i>

413
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,558
<i>what has given you
so much venom.</i>

414
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:49,107
All right. Fill up, quick look
at the map, then we're off.

415
00:32:49,142 --> 00:32:50,603
What's so funny back there?

416
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,110
[Dallas chuckles]

417
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,079
You, Daddy. [chuckles]

418
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:56,708
At least someone
thinks I'm funny.

419
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,315
I think you're funny too, dear.

420
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,053
And incredibly handsome.

421
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:08,357
Ew! Gross!

422
00:33:08,392 --> 00:33:10,128
Gross? Gross?

427
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,642
Unbelievable!
I'm going, all right?

428
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,116
Calm down.

429
00:33:31,151 --> 00:33:33,217
[car honks]

430
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,419
Don't worry, Dallas.
It's not a big deal.

[motorbike rattles]

432
00:33:43,196 --> 00:33:45,130

- Hey, man, calm down, it's all right.

433
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,132
- Everything, hey...
- No, roll down the fucking window!

434
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,793
- I'm sorry.
- Don't roll it down.

435
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,531
Let me... Listen, I'll get
my insurance information.

436
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,434
- Open the window!
- What are you going to do?

437
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:54,502
Don't worry, son, everything
is gonna be all right.

438
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,374
- No! Open it!
- It's all right, man, calm down.

Please, no!
My son is in the car.

00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:46,323
Blue. I need to find Lars.

447
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,589
We need to finish this.

448
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,591
I'm going off book.

449
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,594
Put me in touch
with the Yellow Cab.

Hey, Sergei.

456
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:40,245
How about a food menu, yeah?

457
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,281
How many times do I
tell you? It's Ivan.

458
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:45,349
And you know
we have no kitchen here.

459
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:48,913
You Americans... You wonder
why everyone hates you.

460
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:51,355
How can you hate me?
I'm here day and night.

461
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,884
In fact, I'm the only one
that's ever here.

462
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,952
I don't know how the hell
you keep the doors open.

Huh.

466
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,975
[Patrick] I'm guessing you guys
aren't here for the fried pickles.

467
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:23,420
No, Patrick, we're not here
for the fried pickles.

468
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:25,653
But... [exhales]

469
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,426
Don't worry, you've done
a lot of stuff for me.

470
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:30,625
All right? Uh...

471
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:33,958
And you've cleaned up
a lot of my messes.

472
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:40,734
[vibrating]

473
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:41,900
You gonna get that?

474
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,805
- No.
- [phone vibrates]

475
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:49,006
Hey, it's me.

476
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,415
Look, shit just went sideways.

477
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,714
Tried to call you earlier, but I was
in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.

478
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:56,453
Had to walk a couple of miles
just to get this service.

479
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:57,850
I'm headed to you
as quick as I can,

480
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,423
but you need to get
the fuck out, now.

481
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:02,019
So, what can I do for you?

482
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,926
[chuckles]

483
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:11,897
What? Come on, man.

484
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:13,536
You're staring at me
like you wanna give me...

485
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:16,638
[screams, groans]

486
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:18,706
Not so fuckin' funny
anymore, is it, buddy?

487
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:19,938
Huh, Patrick?

488
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:22,809
[groans]

489
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,482
How does that fuckin'
feel now, motherfucker?

490
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:28,683
This isn't necessary,
I'm just a fuckin' hired hand.

491
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:30,949
Hired hand. Yes, you are.

492
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:33,721
Singular hand, because you
won't be using it as much.

493
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:36,823
What do you think, guys?
That was a funny joke, right?

494
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:38,462
That was a funny joke,
huh? [laughs]

495
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:39,694
Wasn't that a funny joke?

496
00:37:40,895 --> 00:37:43,335
Teddy. Wasn't that a funny joke?

497
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,634
Sir, I've never seen
anything like that before.

498
00:37:45,669 --> 00:37:47,702
That's why I enjoy
working for you.

499
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:49,033
[Lars] What do you think,
though? It's funny though, right?

500
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:51,640
Absolutely, sir. L-O-L.

501
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,611
We'll see you
around buddy, okay?

502
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:56,744
Let's go, guys.

503
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,418
This idiot thinks
he can play both sides.

504
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:02,013
Fuckin' informant.

505
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,521
You're a funny guy, man.
You never learn.

506
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:07,557
[phone beeping]

507
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,826
- Riley, it's me.
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>

508
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:15,763
That's a good fuckin' question.

509
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:17,061
But I'm gonna need a ride.

510
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:22,341
- [groans]
- [man on video indistinct]

511
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:29,073
- [woman on video groaning]
- [man laughs]<i> There she is.</i>

512
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:38,456
It's amazing how they can
doctor video footage today.

513
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,856
- [tense music playing]
- [Iris sighs]

514
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:46,629
When he gets here,
he's gonna kill you.

515
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:53,999
You know, when you get
that little anger streak,

516
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:57,607
you look really beautiful.

517
00:38:57,642 --> 00:38:58,971
Really beautiful.

518
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,006
The sooner this is over,
the better.

519
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:04,416
I'm just waiting
for all this to be over.

520
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:08,145
Yeah, I'm waiting for it
to be over, too. Um...

521
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,719
This guy has been
a big fucking problem.

522
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,459
I mean, all the people
I deal with,

523
00:39:14,494 --> 00:39:16,494
the biker gangs, the cartel.

524
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:20,894
Them supplying services
that they can't do right now.

525
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,963
And they don't want to hear
about these problems, at all.

526
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:27,571
Okay? I'm gonna find out who the fuck he's
working for, and then I'm gonna kill him.

527
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,772
For all intents and purposes,
you... you've moved on anyways.

528
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:32,939
I mean, unfortunately,
he has not.

529
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,006
Mm.

530
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:42,652
At no point have I ever
indicated that I've moved on.

531
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:45,589
Then you're a really fucking
good actress then, aren't you?

532
00:39:45,624 --> 00:39:48,185
I did what I had to do.
Nothing more.

533
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:53,960
And the sooner this little
charade is finished,

534
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:57,535
we can stop pretending that
this was ever anything more.

535

it's all perspective.

710
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:27,416
Ah, let's face it, no one
ever wants to see themselves

711
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:28,978
as the bad guy, right?

712
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:32,190
Oh, I so wish you were under
that hood right now.

713
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:35,424
- What?
- [sighs]

714
00:52:37,494 --> 00:52:38,922
Oh, never mind.

715
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:42,398
Hey, take it easy.

716
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:44,367
You got a nice crack
on the back of your head.

717
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,736
- [sniffs]
- It's water.

718
00:52:59,285 --> 00:53:00,713
Lars is a glorified middle man

719
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,913
for the biker gangs
and drug cartels.

720
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,487
For whatever reason,

721
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:07,984
you've been going
across the country

722
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,689
really fucking up business,

723
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:13,660
which leaves that glorified
middle man in a bad, bad spot.

724
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:17,697
Well, I know why I'm here,

725
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:22,768
but why are you still alive?

726
00:53:24,508 --> 00:53:26,574
Honestly, your guess
is as good as mine.

727
00:53:27,543 --> 00:53:30,809
Best guess, that sick fuck Lars
wants to kill me himself.

728
00:53:34,617 --> 00:53:37,750
- [gate creaks]
- Let's go.

729
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,489
Guess I'm about to find out.

730
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:42,722
Not you, asshole.

731
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:50,499
What are you gonna do to him?

732
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:53,502
I don't know. Nothing.

733
00:53:54,171 --> 00:53:56,439
I mean, I pay guys
to do that stuff.

734
00:53:58,971 --> 00:54:01,037
Why don't you just kill him
and get it over with?

735
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:05,844
Whatever happened to...
"Oh, he's gonna kill me."

736
00:54:07,749 --> 00:54:08,847
And don't worry.

737
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:12,653
Where they're taking him,
there's no cameras.

738
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:15,491
At all.

739
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:32,838
Nice Halloween costume.

740
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,546
Where's Iris?

741
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,851
You creepy fuckers
and your little torture kits.

742
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:52,726
And all of you tough guys with
your cheap and wasted bravado.

743
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:57,467
I assure you,
I'm not like the others.

744
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:00,503
That's what they all say.

745
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:05,970
Do you honestly think
this is the first time

746
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,610
I've been injected
with sodium pentothal?

747
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:12,350
Ah, damn! That was cold.

748
00:55:13,086 --> 00:55:15,914
[sighs] How about you
warn me next time, huh?

749
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:19,687
Tell me...

750
00:55:20,222 --> 00:55:21,788
Who do you work for?

751
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,593
I don't work for anyone.

752
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:27,398
- [taser clicking]
- [screaming]

753
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,666
Fuck. [groans]

754
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:34,735
Who do you work for?

755
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:40,807
[groans] Oh, man, I had it
for a second, and then I lost it.

756
00:55:40,842 --> 00:55:42,479
Hit me with that thing again.

757
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,813
[laughs, screams]

758
00:55:47,348 --> 00:55:49,453
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

759
00:55:50,588 --> 00:55:57,054
- [coughs]
- Who do you work for?

760
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:01,762
McDonald's.

761
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,028
[taser clicking]

762
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:14,709
No, no, no, no.

763
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:22,486
You don't get to check out
until I get what I want.

764
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:26,622
[sighs] A Happy Meal?

765
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:30,659
[groaning continues]

766
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:36,126
I'm not gonna ask you again!

767
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:37,963
Who do you work for?

768
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:41,230
And I'm not gonna ask you again.

769
00:56:41,265 --> 00:56:43,705
Where is Iris?

770
00:56:44,407 --> 00:56:45,740
- [groaning]
- [taser clicking]

771
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,547
[man laughs]

772
00:56:57,919 --> 00:56:58,951
Oh...

773
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:04,055
Jesus.

774
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:11,766
If you're gonna kill the guy,
just do it already!

775
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:19,037
Got anymore of that water?

776
00:57:22,042 --> 00:57:24,713
You're one tough son
of a bitch, I'll give you that.

777
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:36,824
[groans] - Seeing
how you're still alive,

778
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,662
I'm guessing they didn't get
what they wanted outta you?

779
00:57:40,231 --> 00:57:42,159
I got nothing to tell. [sighs]

780
00:57:43,228 --> 00:57:44,601
Of course not.

781
00:57:46,165 --> 00:57:47,901
Look, they're gonna keep trying

782
00:57:47,936 --> 00:57:49,771
until you either tell 'em
what they wanna know,

783
00:57:49,806 --> 00:57:52,576
and then they'll thankfully
put you outta your misery,

784
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:56,107
or you manage to hold out
and not tell them.

785
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:58,175
I got nothing to tell.

786
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,082
Yeah, whatever you say, man.

787
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:08,053
The point is they'll be back.

788
00:58:08,088 --> 00:58:11,056
And eventually, no matter what,

789
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:13,630
you'll be dead.

790
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,764
We'll both be dead.

791
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,097
I'm waiting for that, but...

792
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:23,068
Look, my head
is fucking killing me,

793
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:27,809
so if you can just get to it,
that'd be great. [exhales]

794
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:39,920
But if you trust me...

795
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,127
[tense music playing]

796
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:05,044
Hey, I'm taking a leap of
faith here trusting you too.

797
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:07,277
But if you wanna get out
here alive and save Iris,

798
00:59:07,312 --> 00:59:09,752
- then I suggest...
- What did you say?

799
00:59:11,954 --> 00:59:13,657
How'd you know about Iris?

800
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,352
What?

801
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,630
I never mentioned her to you.

802
00:59:20,996 --> 00:59:23,667
Look, why do you think
I brought you here?

803
00:59:23,702 --> 00:59:25,702
When Lars wants
something, he gets it.

804
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:30,234
And that includes
the girl, I'm afraid.

805
00:59:30,269 --> 00:59:33,974
You have no idea what
you're talking about,

806
00:59:34,009 --> 00:59:37,175
so I strongly suggest
you stop talking!

807
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,913
Well, I don't know
if you know this or not,

808
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:40,343
but talking's kind of my thing.

809
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,754
Well, I don't know
if you noticed or not,

810
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,789
but killing's kinda my thing.

811
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:50,155
Look, all I'm saying is that

812
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,860
you're in here
because of some girl

813
00:59:51,895 --> 00:59:54,258
who doesn't even wanna be
with you anymore.

814
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:55,732
[both grunting]

815
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,294
Hey, cut it out in there!

816
00:59:58,396 --> 01:00:00,836
Shit. Should we do something?

817
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:03,366
Nah, the boss don't give
a shit about that guy.

818
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,709
We gotta keep
the other guy alive.

819
01:00:05,744 --> 01:00:07,678
[intense music playing]

820
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:14,982
Hey! That's enough!

821
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:16,247
You're gonna kill him!

822
01:00:18,317 --> 01:00:19,888
[both grunting]

823
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:22,759
Die! You son of a bitch!

824
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:25,223
[grunting continues]

825
01:00:25,258 --> 01:00:26,697
[Dallas screams]

826
01:00:30,131 --> 01:00:31,966
You better hope
he's still alive.

827
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:33,330
Fuck!

828
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,003
[grunting]

829
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:44,715
[neck breaks]

830
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:55,792
So, what's the plan?

831
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:58,762
Are you kidding me? I thought
you were Special Forces.

832
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:00,192
It's been a while!

833
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:01,765
Well, that's just great.

834
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:05,461
This motherfucker.
They should both be dead.

835
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,871
[tense music playing]

836
01:01:13,108 --> 01:01:14,404
Well, that was sooner
than expected.

837
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:17,275
- Take him, I'll kill.
- Copy that.

838
01:01:21,787 --> 01:01:23,149
How is he doing that?

839
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,185
I don't know, Lars.

840
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,451
You could've killed him
when you had a chance,

841
01:01:28,486 --> 01:01:32,895
but you decided to be a
walking, talking bad guy cliché.

842
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,095
Oh, yeah. And then what?
What do they do?

843
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,394
They just replace him with
somebody else. That's all they do.

844
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:41,200
We're all just playing a part
in this little story here.

845
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:42,300
And you.

846
01:01:43,236 --> 01:01:47,140
- This damsel in distress.
- Yeah, and who did that to me?

847
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:52,277
You're about as useful as
a fuckin' three-legged chair.

848
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,414
[grunting]

849
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:05,763
[intense music playing]

850
01:02:07,899 --> 01:02:08,931
[neck cracks]

851
01:02:22,243 --> 01:02:24,012
[gun firing]

852
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:51,039
There you are, you little shit.

853
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,439
[Riley]<i> Antano,</i>
<i>I think I got it.</i>

854
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:01,115
[Antano] What exactly
am I looking at?

855
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,887
Some kind of storage
or shipping container,

856
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:05,218
but look what's under it.

857
01:03:06,054 --> 01:03:08,089
Wait a minute,
this is all underground?

858
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:09,552
Looks like it.

859
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:11,961
Okay, you know what?
Keep the drone on it,

860
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,293
get us all available
backup in the area.

861
01:03:14,328 --> 01:03:16,130
Also a layout
of the entire structure,

862
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:18,132
and a verified head count
before anyone arrives.

863
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,870
Yeah, it shouldn't be a problem.

864
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:26,239
Hey, it's me. We got his location,
we're about 20 minutes out.

865
01:03:27,143 --> 01:03:28,340
I'll call you soon.

866
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:30,540
[phone beeps]

867
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:39,516
- [cartridge clinks]
- [grunting]

868
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,125
[Patrick groans]

869
01:03:45,227 --> 01:03:46,325
[man 1 yells]

870
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:49,933
[man 2 grunts]

871
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:02,605
[grunts]

872
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,614
You shot me on purpose,
didn't you?

873
01:04:11,649 --> 01:04:14,023
I think "thank you" are
the words you're looking for.

874
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,387
I could've shot you in the head.

875
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:16,927
Ah, that's valid.

876
01:04:17,863 --> 01:04:21,129
Technically, you have
to tell me who you work for,

877
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:22,592
since you shot me and all.

878
01:04:23,364 --> 01:04:24,462
Technically,

879
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:27,201
who said I'm working?

880
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:28,598
Come on, let's go.

881
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:31,370
Oh, you go ahead.

882
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:33,075
I'll catch up.

883
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,605
I got this nice, fresh
bullet wound to tend to!

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,395
Hello?

1062
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,200
Bringing you in
was never part of the plan.

1063
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:11,773
Voner?

1064
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:13,940
At least not to the authorities.

1065
01:16:13,975 --> 01:16:15,744
Voner, what's going on?

1066
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,109
Where's Blue?

1067
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:20,111
Blue's okay,
don't worry about him.

1068
01:16:20,146 --> 01:16:22,311
<i>I see things went
a little sideways,</i>

1069
01:16:22,346 --> 01:16:24,379
thanks to Lars and Iris.

1070
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:26,953
But there's still
a lot of work to do.

1071
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:28,889
[tense music playing]

1072
01:16:30,156 --> 01:16:31,287
Listen.

1073
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:34,730
This has nothing
to do with Iris.

1074
01:16:34,765 --> 01:16:37,293
Blue's always done
right by you, Dallas.

1075
01:16:38,065 --> 01:16:39,295
By you and me.

1076
01:16:41,167 --> 01:16:44,806
And what you two guys built
together still remains.

1077
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,842
Nothing's different.

1078
01:16:47,877 --> 01:16:49,745
<i>The only difference is, you
don't have to do it alone this time.</i>

1079
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,209
I'll be around to assist
in any way needed.

1080
01:16:53,377 --> 01:16:54,816
I work alone.

1081
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:58,116
Well, now you and I both know
that's not exactly true.

1082
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:02,890
Maybe it was a good thing
that you and Iris reconnected.

1083
01:17:02,925 --> 01:17:03,957
Who knows?

1084
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,861
No, no.

1085
01:17:06,896 --> 01:17:09,061
Not after what
happened to Trish.

1086
01:17:09,096 --> 01:17:10,227
I can't.

1087
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:15,771
We know what happened
with Trish, and it's not your fault.

1088
01:17:15,806 --> 01:17:18,268
I'm not gonna let you
beat yourself up over that.

1089
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:20,138
<i>At least not as long as the...</i>

1090
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:24,813
the person who killed
your father is still out there.

1091
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:29,015
Now, listen, I want you
to take your time, Dallas.

1092
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,445
Think this over.

1093
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,216
<i>Don't make any decisions
right away.</i>

1094
01:17:32,251 --> 01:17:34,152
You could even talk
to Blue first.

1095
01:17:34,854 --> 01:17:36,957
And I don't want you to come in.

1096
01:17:38,389 --> 01:17:40,356
Got a little loose end
I'd like you to take a look at,

1097
01:17:40,391 --> 01:17:43,029
- if you don't mind.
- Right away.

1098
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:46,362
Hell, I'll cut a loose end.

1099
01:17:47,904 --> 01:17:50,201
You came across a couple
detectives of ours.

1100
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:52,841
Detective Roberts, Detective
Lenwood. Is that right?

1101
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,140
Yeah, what about them?

1102
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:57,780
Well, we just had
a body turn up,

1103
01:17:57,815 --> 01:18:03,016
and it was preliminarily
identified as Detective Roberts.

1104
01:18:03,752 --> 01:18:05,381
Well, his partner,
Detective Lenwood,

1105
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,251
is the prime suspect
in the murder.

1106
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,387
And you buy that?

1107
01:18:12,863 --> 01:18:15,226
[chuckles] No, I don't.

1108
01:18:16,262 --> 01:18:19,131
'Cause I don't even think
Detective Roberts is dead.

1109
01:18:21,432 --> 01:18:24,169
[Voner]<i> I'll see you</i>
<i>soon, Dallas.</i>

1110
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:27,040
In the meantime, I have a few
loose ends of my own to tie up.

1111
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,050
[grunts]

1112
01:18:37,552 --> 01:18:40,251
Ah, yeah. Thanks.

1113
01:18:43,487 --> 01:18:45,487
[exhales] Is he in a good mood?

1114
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:48,226
Ah, you know, always the same.

1115
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,361
- [nurse] You're good.
- [Boris sighs]

1116
01:18:51,396 --> 01:18:53,297
Can you, uh... Oh.

1117
01:18:53,332 --> 01:18:55,398
Can you excuse us for a bit?

1118
01:18:55,433 --> 01:18:56,531
[nurse] Of course.

1119
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:00,271
You know what, ma'am?

1120
01:19:00,873 --> 01:19:02,537
I breathe better without it.

1121
01:19:03,408 --> 01:19:04,506
How about that?

1122
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:07,509
- [grunts]
- How you doin'? You okay?

1123
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:10,083
What the fuck kind
of question is that?

1124
01:19:10,118 --> 01:19:11,183
You know what this is?

1125
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:14,857
I have to breathe in that
so many minutes a day,

1126
01:19:14,892 --> 01:19:18,091
or they say I'll be dead,
but I'll never be dead.

1127
01:19:21,426 --> 01:19:23,360
What happened with the appeal?

1128
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:26,935
And Dallas?

1129
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:30,906
Well, he did everything
that Blue asked him to do.

1130
01:19:30,941 --> 01:19:32,039
As always.

1131
01:19:35,407 --> 01:19:37,341
You know what Ultio means?

1132
01:19:38,509 --> 01:19:40,014
Revenge.

1133
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:45,085
And you know what
the blind man did?

1134
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,889
He made a weapon.

1135
01:19:47,518 --> 01:19:49,155
He made a weapon.

1136
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:52,389
And the problem is,
he can't control him.

1137
01:19:54,162 --> 01:19:58,395
So you and I, we are gonna
have to take control.

1138
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,298
I'm already moving on that.

1139
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,533
And we have full support
of the government.

1140
01:20:05,404 --> 01:20:06,843
[laughs]

1141
01:20:08,374 --> 01:20:09,978
- Really?
- Yeah.

1142
01:20:11,476 --> 01:20:13,608
You don't have anything
else to say to me?

1143
01:20:17,218 --> 01:20:18,415
Yeah, I do.

1144
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,890
We had a little complication.

1145
01:20:22,091 --> 01:20:23,926
- How was that?
- With Lars?

1146
01:20:23,961 --> 01:20:25,488
He escaped, he got away.

1147
01:20:29,934 --> 01:20:30,966
Ivan!

1148
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:35,498
The man needs ice. More ice.

1149
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:38,908
I know you have
an ice pick, Ivan.

1150
01:20:38,943 --> 01:20:40,976
Why don't you stab it
three times

1151
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:44,276
and bring him three pieces
of fucking ice for his drink?

1152
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,485
And we even did
everything we could. We...

1153
01:20:55,954 --> 01:20:58,961
We actually used Iris as bait.

1154
01:20:59,997 --> 01:21:01,623
I didn't sanction that.

1155
01:21:02,092 --> 01:21:04,659
I thought it'd be
a good idea, and it worked.

1156
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:08,333
Well, don't ever tell him,

1157
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:11,468
because we sure as hell
don't want that weapon

1158
01:21:11,503 --> 01:21:14,339
turned around at us.

1159
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:16,341
Or we're done.

1160
01:21:19,445 --> 01:21:21,511

01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:35,030
