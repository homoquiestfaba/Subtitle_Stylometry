Yeah. This very informal

00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,505
Well, I favor you
with a monthly check, I believe.

178
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:41,665
Shalom, big boy.

179
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:44,335
Because I'm too old to be
going out Manhattan South

180
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,604
for horny movie stars.

181
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:49,011
We ended up in the wrong place.
This girl, she gets around.

182
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:53,485
She likes to play it slumming,
and it bit her in the ass.

183
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,386
Man, you know,
you behave like it's 1970

184
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,720
and you're still living in Malibu.

185
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,121
There may be somebody
from one of the papers there.

186
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,792
You're gonna come to my thing
at the Palm.

187
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,068
Thank you.

188
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,172
Thank you.

189
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,523
Two, three.

190
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,533
[Telephone ringing]

191
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,195
[Door closes]

192
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,101
Shit.

193
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:53,302
- What are you here for, Eli?
- They're having a raffle.

194
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,506
I thought I'd just see
if I get lucky.

195
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,674
What's the prize?

196
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,309
The TV starlet, maybe?

197
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:01,353
You don't have
that many clients anymore.

198
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:03,946
I can figure it out.
Better if you tell me.

199
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,753
Who am I telling? Norris Volpe
or the "New York Post"?

200
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,454
You didn't invite me to your benefit.

201
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,726
I like causes.
Should've put me on the list.

202
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,893
You're invited. You sit at
my table next to Cary Launer.

203
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,199
- Done deal.
- He won't show.

204
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,463
Her network has me on retainer.

205
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,806
This thing leaks, I'm out.

206
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,642
You take the food out of my mouth.

207
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:30,740
Norris, I need the job.
Please.

208
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,149
The only reason
that schmaltz works for me

209
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:35,153
is you're so moth-eaten.

210
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:36,916
If I fucked you, there'd be nobody

211
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,390
from the old days
for me to play with.

212
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,384
Pervy little tabloid cocksucker.

213
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,089
I heard that.

214
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,059
MAN: Ms. Hopper,
we need your date of birth.

215
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,968
- Yeah. Right.
- [Buzzer sounds]

216
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:54,768
Ms. Hopper,
I'm Jerome Eli Wurman.

217
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,833
Took long enough.
Where's the car? I stink.

218
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:05,578
Since when did this town start
arresting people for having fun?

219
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,643
You tell me.

220
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,617
Got to check everything, 'cause
they go through your stuff

221
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:18,789
like it's a fucking grab bag.

222
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,594
Yeah.

223
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:21,793
Well, it's all right.

224
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,599
We don't live in a town
with a morals clause.

225
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,663
Where are you from?

226
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,298
Georgia. Listen.

227
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,310
You need some sleep
and something in your stomach.

228
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,313
You'll be as good as new.
Believe me.

229
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:38,111
Come on.
It's all right.

230
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,276
Yeah.

231
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:42,719
This is why I don't come back
to New York.

232
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:46,452
Because I fall right on my ass
every time.

233
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:48,619
Yeah. I know.

234
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:52,858
I just wish I had a little
perfume or something.

235
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,396
Listen.
I got a good doctor.

236
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:58,835
He's a quiet little pussycat.
You know what I'm saying?

237
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,100
You got any Xanax?

238
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:04,772
You want Xanax from me?

239
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,472
Let's see what I got
in the drugstore.

240
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,141
Pills, pills.
Here you go.

241
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,979
A little Xanax.

242
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,110
Can I interest you

243
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:20,558
in something like
a nice cobb salad or papaya?

244
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:23,686
Some matzo ball soup
like my mama used to make?

245
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:24,855
Hmm?

246
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,523
Back in Georgia?

247
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:30,035
Yeah. [Chuckles]

248
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,866
You all right?

249
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,769
Come on.

250
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,774
This must be fun for you.

251
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,275
It is.
I love it.

252
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,436
Squiring a pretty girl around town.

253
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:40,774
Sure.

254
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:43,577
The network's being
pretty nice to me, sending...

255
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,278
What, you're the East Coast
V.P. Of casting

256
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:48,342
or something?

257
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,355
Really.

258
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,186
So, what time is your call?

259
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,190
It's noon.

260
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,023
If I get the 6:00 a.m. Flight,
I'll make it.

261
00:11:56,095 --> 00:12:00,293
We're gonna take you over
your hotel and get you packed

262
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,733
and then take you
on over to Teterboro,

263
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:07,398
where Cary has a plane
to take you back to the coast.

264
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:08,735
All right?

265
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,070
Cary.

266
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,735
Cary Launer.

267
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,405
You're a fucking Cary Launer lapdog?

268
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,777
That's great.

269
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,214
- That's just great.
- Easy, now. Come on.

270
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,445
I see.
Where is he?

271
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,420
Whoa.

272
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:23,580
Oh, no, no.

273
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,624
You don't want to do that!
Please.

274
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,751
Please, honey.
Please don't do that.

275
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,160
Just calm yourself.
It's okay.

276
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,561
It's all right.
Please.

277
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,827
Did he ask if I had
something for him?

278
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:36,732
No.

279
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,696
Turn around.

280
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,831
We're gonna go downtown.
Wall Street.

281
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:42,966
Excuse me?

282
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,100
Wally, no.
Don't.

283
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,701
Turn around.

284
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:47,575
Turn the fucking car around.

285
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,615
- Just two minutes.
- Turn it, Wally.

286
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,741
He's an asshole.

287
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,320
This is true.

288
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,948
Oh, I hate to see people
get into messes.

289
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:00,959
I handled a lot of stars
back in the day.

290
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,019
I had Monty Clift.
I had Mama Cass.

291
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,997
Fat lot of good you did them.

292
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:10,661
Well, all I can tell you,
the clock is ticking away.

Summerwear showroom.

297
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:39,560
So, how long you been
Cary Launer's Gotham butt boy?

298
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:42,795
You'll make this quick.
'Cause I got a big day tomorrow.

299
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,131
Okay?

300
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:47,730
You got to pick up
the movie star's dirty laundry?

301
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,900
No, I got to drop it off
at an airfield

302
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,672
so it can fly back home on its own.

303
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,838
Touché, little fella.

304
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:56,779
You know what my mama used to say?

305
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:58,680
Good manners make for good memories.

306
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,514
Bad manners make for goodbyes.

Who the fuck is your mama?
Harriet Beecher Stowe?

308

Great.
A literary whore.

309
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:07,924
No wonder Cary likes you.

310
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:18,726
It's a long way up, hmm?

311
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,470
You don't look so great.
Are you okay?

312
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:26,068
I'm having a peach of a time.

313

Aside from the blood in my urine.

314
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,509
And you.

315
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,778

Oh, I love it.
But not tonight.

319
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:47,391
See, I'm being a good boy tonight.

320
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,730
Yeah.
I can tell.

321
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:53,563
If you happen to know
anybody here, don't say hello.

322
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,732
That's gonna be tough.
I know everyone.

323
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,537
Not here, you don't.

324
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,045
This will just take a second.

325

Oh, no, no.

329
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,886
I don't believe in cellphones.
They give you cancer.

no recording devices,

wallets, or chewing gum.

333
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,862
Oh, that's sugarless.

334
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,566
These will be returned to you
on your way out.

336

- Hi.
- Eli.

340

I've been trying to reach you
about my benefit.

341
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,790
I didn't know you came to this place.

342

I'm not gonna read about this,
page 6 of the "Post"?

Well, it's a terrible thing.
But don't hustle me here.

349
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,946
That's bad form.

350
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,646
What is this place, anyway?

a bent little Southern boy
like you could possibly want.

353
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,260
[Both chuckle]

354
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,193
Huh?
Go. Look.

355
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,925
Touch. Play. Feel.

356
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,864
What is this place?

357
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,868
What is the big deal?

358
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,870
I don't know.
You know who that is?

359
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:34,530
That's Elliot Sharansky.

360
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,905
He's worth billions.

361
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:38,739
Oh, my God.

362
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,676
Opium?

363
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,236
Good nose.

364
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,519
You were here with Cary?

365
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,020
Oh, yeah.

366
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,353
Oh, you must be a very bad influence.

367
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:57,158
Because I know my boy, and
Cary Launer never does drugs.

368
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,322
Yeah. Maybe.

369
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:02,924
He sure as shit likes to watch
other people do them, right?

370
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,699
How long has this place been here?

371
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:09,438
It floats.

372
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:12,068
Well, I don't know
the right people, I guess.

373
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,076
Come on, kiddo.

374
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:15,807
We'll go to the Odeon
for a burger and a vodka.

375
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,247
I'll listen to you talk
about your life.

376
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:21,809
- We can't stay here.
- I'm trying to find my thing.

377
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,553
Go ahead.

378
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,559
Now, I'm tempted.

379
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:30,720
It's right off the boat from Myanmar.

380
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,923
Well, in that case.

381
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,489
- Do it.
- I can't do this.

382
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:49,912
[Exhales deeply]

383
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,644
Boy, you have a nice smile, kiddo.

384
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:53,685
You do modeling?

385
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:57,712
'Cause my name's Eli Wurman,
and I do a lot of events.

386
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,521
Maybe if you want to drop by.

387
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,357
My card.

388
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,059
What is that thing
you're looking for, anyway?

389
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,965
My little toy.

390
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,371
Oh.

391
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:19,138
I need a constant distraction
or I lose control.

392
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:21,145
Do you believe that?

393
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,374
Control is very important.

394
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:27,385
Because without it,
there's indiscretion,

395
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,717
which is a cardinal sin.

396
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,053
- So true, Jilli.
- [Gasps, laughs]

397
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:33,557
Hey, Serge.

398
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:34,718
The man knows.

399
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,694
- This is Eli.
- How do you do?

400
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:37,694
- Serge.
- Eli.

401
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,695
Serge.

402
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,789
JILLI:
[Laughing] We got to talk.

403
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,299
SERGE:
Mm-hmm.

404
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,097
I love your setup here.

405
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,933
About what happened earlier?

406
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,668
I was fucked up.
I didn't realize how bad it was.

407
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,472
Oh, Jilli, darling.

408
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,139
ELI: Nigerians.
The INS deportees...

409
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:58,206
SERGE: It's too late for that.
Let's just say our goodbyes.

410
00:18:58,284 --> 00:18:59,581
Shit.

411
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:03,418
Listen, Serge.
I didn't mean to.

412
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:06,117
I have to come back, okay?
I want to come back.

413
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,626
Everyone's hands are tied.

414
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,219
It's time for you to move on.

415
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,457
No.

416
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:16,297
It happens to everyone.
We all have our time.

417
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,235
Wait a second.
Serge, it was a joke.

418
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,966
I'm joking.
You know me.

419
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,600
SERGE:
Jilli, Jilli.

420
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:26,076
- JILLI: Why?
- SERGE: You know the rules.

421
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,106
How many times do I have to tell you?

422
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:31,114
Wait.

423
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,344
Remember what you did
earlier tonight?

424
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,910
What did I do?
I don't know what I did.

425
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,717
- I don't...
- Goodbye.

426
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,520
I don't know what I did!

427
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:41,582
Where's my toy?

428
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,992
Where's my fucking toy, you bastard?

429
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,395
This?
You're too old for this.

430
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,427
I got all you guys now.

431
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,703
[Laughs]

432
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,242
It's all right, honey.

433
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,108
I fucking hate that guy.

434
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,512
Yeah.
All right, darling.

435
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,914
Okay, honey.
I'm gonna take care of you.

436
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,418
I'll get you home.

437
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:09,647
Get all this stuff cleaned up

438
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:14,125
and settle in
and get you on that plane.

439
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,594
Here you go.
There you go, darling.

440
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,096
Come on.

441
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,597
Come on.
I got you.

442
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,258
[Grunts]

443
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,926
That's fine.

444
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,937
You're gonna be fine.

445
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,666
There you are.

446
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,940
Ooh, man.

447
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:48,989
JILLI:
There's paparazzi at the hotel.

448
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:52,963
Oh, you just leave that
to little old Eli.

449
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,023
I'll take care of you there, honey.

450
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,331
I don't want you.
I want Cary.

451
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:01,896
Well, you're just stuck
with me, honey.

452
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:09,876
Hey, Ms. Hopper!

453
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:10,881
Ms. Hopper!

454
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,542
Come on!
How about a picture?

455
00:21:12,618 --> 00:21:13,949
Come on!

456
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:20,421
Look over here!
Ms. Hopper!

457
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,502
Let's be quick.

458
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,333
Okay, honey?

459
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:37,000
So pack up, now.

460
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,477
This is not a room.

461
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,309
It's a vagina.

462
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:45,145
And how would you know
what a vagina looks like?

463
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,048
Well...

464
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,882
Room service.

465
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,149
I need two Monte Cristos.

466
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:56,058
One on sourdough
and the other a double corona.

467
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,619
Oh, see...

468
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:04,294
one is a sandwich,
and the other is a cigar.

469
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,637
What do you want?

470
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:11,665
I'd like one of them...
Italian antiacids.

471
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,338
Fizzle in the water
like a science experiment.

472
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,040
What's it called?
Brioschi?

473
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:19,050
Why don't you call and see?

474
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,847
Okay.

475
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,187
There were vigils for the deportees.

476
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,589
Demonstrators spent the day
in front of City Hall.

477
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,957
No. Don't.

478
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:32,520
Don't change the channel.

479
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,025
Come on.
You got to pack, honey.

480
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:39,662
We're gonna do something here.

481
00:22:39,738 --> 00:22:42,070
- [Answering machine beeps]
- Fuck.

482
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:45,770
Cary, how fucking dare you send
a fucking publicist?

483
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,903
You know what?
You know what?

484
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,145
I have lists of all you fat,
old, impotent fucks!

485
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,982
Oh! Jeez.

486
00:22:56,055 --> 00:23:00,219
Maybe I'm just a cracker
from down South, but...

487
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,728
what you want to go back
to hustling for?

488
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,889
Who said I was a hustler?

489
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:06,931
- Well...
- No.

490
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,728
Put down my underwear.

491
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,965
I don't know.
See...

492
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:13,231
Fuck.

493
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:18,006
You wouldn't want to take a nap
with me, would you, honey?

494
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,567
You know?

495
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:23,137
Just crawl up on the bed here
for a half-hour or so?

496
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,445
And do what?
Fuck?

497
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,849
That a challenge?

498
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:34,321
Well... I have to say.

499
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:35,826
You look like someone

500
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:38,556
who doesn't like to touch
other people.

501
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,994
I need it to be romantic.

502
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:45,127
I can do romantic.

503
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,973
[Grunts]

504
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,610
Please.

505
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,483
Don't.

506
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:04,988
[Exhales deeply]

507
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:09,790
What do you and Cary do?
Hmm?

508
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,626
[Exhales deeply]

509
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:15,132
He likes games.

510
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,997
Sports.

511
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,832
Like baseball?

512
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,667
Football?

513
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,001
Polo?

514
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,507
Ping-pong?

515
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,475
Less physical, you know?

516
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,513
More like chess.

517
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:36,444
You look terrible.

518
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,413
Are you okay?

519
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:43,825
Well, you think this is what
I want to do with my life?

520
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:47,994
I want to spend my nights like this?

521
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:52,262
He calls, I come.

522
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,396
His slave.

523
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,134
[Grunts]

524
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:09,279
Everybody's looking for
an out clause.

525
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:16,720
But you got to do it soon.
Okay, honey?

526
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:19,730
'Cause you don't look like
you can take

527
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,857
much more of this shit.

528
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:27,067
I'm gonna wash my face.

529
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:30,108
I'm gonna clean myself up.

530
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,937
I can't do this with you.

531
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,446
I'm getting out soon.

532
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:41,817
I got some property in the Tidewater.

533
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:46,881
And I'm gonna build me
a little shack on the water.

534
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:52,259
Well, it sounds good to me.

535
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:55,323
You can come anytime.

536
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:06,644
Oh, Jesus.

537
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,146
These hotel room lights.

538
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:10,943
I tell you.

539
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:16,446
I love the country.

540
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,352
It's nice.

541
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,817
Pastoral.

542
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,830
Oh, man.

543
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:31,336
I look like Dracula's
Uncle Morty from Kiev.

544
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:34,668
Oh, man.
I should be embalmed.

545
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,641
Oh, my God.
[Urinating]

546
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:40,644
Oh, man.

547
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:41,804
[Toilet flushes]

548
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,906
Sandy? Sandy?

549
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:46,644
Did you get my message?

550
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:48,310
It's Eli.

551
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:50,150
I call you.

552
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,814
Well, don't you call back?

553
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,721
What kind of doctor are you?

554
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,759
Listen.

555
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:58,284
I'm definitely seeing blood
in my urine now.

556
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,955
Yeah.

557
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:01,465
I don't know.

558
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:03,091
I don't...

559
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,602
Did I have too many beets?

560
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,765
Oh, Jesus, Sandy.

561
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,102
What are you?

562
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,938
Man, I don't know.

563
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,275
Maybe I had too many drugs.

564
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:18,009
Did you ever think of that?

565
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,177
Maybe it's the lights in here.

566
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,916
Oh, shit.
I don't know.

567
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,255
Oh, it's the whole thing, Sandy.

568
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:29,919
I went to Harvard.

569
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:32,259
I went to Harvard Law.

570
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:36,324
You should see what I got
in the other room.

571
00:27:36,401 --> 00:27:38,528
I got a starlet in there

572
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:42,039
with more drugs than I've ever seen.

573
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,702
We could start a fucking cartel.

574
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:46,869
Yeah.

575
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:49,709
I know.
I'll just take some Ambien.

576
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,544
I will take some Ambien.

577
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,607
Yes. Yes.

578
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,518
- I know. I'll get some sleep.
- [Knock on door]

579
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,386
Sandy.

580
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:01,254
Oh, Sandy.

581
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:04,751
- You gonna come to my benefit?
- [Door opens, closes]

582
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,162
[Weakly] You coming tonight?

583
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:11,726
[Muffled shouting]

584
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:16,100
[Jilli gasping, grunting]

585
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,759
[Door opens, closes]

586
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,609
[Clock ticking]

587
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,644
ROSS: Yes.

588
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,151
Ahmet Ertegun, no.

589
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,312
Paula Abdul, no.

590
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,513
Eartha Kitt, maybe.

591
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:12,250
And Kelly Klein wants to know

592
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,054
if she can bring Tina Chow's sister.

593
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:16,219
ELI: What?

594
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,091
Time to get up.

595
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,095
Barry called.

596
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:21,792
He's not sure
he's gonna be back in time.

597
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:22,799
Nor is Sandy.

598
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,428
But Calvin is coming late, maybe.

599
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:29,133
And Ross Bleckner wants to
bring Larry Rivers.

600
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,675
Who RS VP'd?
Did Regis?

601
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:32,971
Did you get him?

602
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:33,976
No.

603
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,808
Dr. Napier is here.

604
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,212
Sandy? Why?

605
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:39,773
You seem to have called him
about blood in your urine

606
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,614
in the middle of the night.

607
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:42,618
I did?

608
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:43,619
Yeah.

609
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:46,418
And then again, like an hour later,

610
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:49,324
about your life and taking
a whore to an airport.

611
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:50,486
A what?

612
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,325
I don't know.

613
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,833
Eli, are you sure you're okay?

614
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,493
Yeah.

615
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:02,238
You got the seating chart?

616
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,077
Wrong glasses, E.

617
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,086
No.

618
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:19,282
Don't put the Grants next to the bar.

619
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:22,622
They're gonna make noise all
night trying to get martinis.

620
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:25,254
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

621
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,731
I got to train you 24-7.

622
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,892
All right.

623
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:32,596
You work on my speech?

624
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:34,502
Here's a draft.

625
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,472
REGIS:
Jilli Hopper.

626
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:40,977
You know, that hot model

627
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,879
and star of the USA Network's
"Assassina."

628
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:45,940
Yeah. All of that...

629
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:49,082
What do you think?

630
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,384
You're no Ted Sorensen.

631
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,822
Who's that?

632
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:59,388
Your blood pressure is even
a little higher than usual.

633
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:00,691
What does that mean?

634
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:03,633
It may have something to do
with what's going on down there.

635
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:06,170
Oh, you know,
I got this big night tonight.

636
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:08,638
I got these poor boys
being persecuted.

637
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,868
You really don't remember calling me?

638
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,034
No.

639
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,010
Eli, you're taking too much stuff.

640
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,410
I know.
You're right.

641
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,641
But you give me all this stuff.

642
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:20,879
What is this crap you're giving me?

643
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,546
Oh, come on.
Do you mix these things?

644
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:25,214
Huh? What else?

645
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:29,624
Well, I might have had
some opium with some E.

646
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,594
Would that make me see things?

647
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:34,257
Gee, I don't know, Eli.
What do you think?

648
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:36,425
Of course you're hallucinating.

649
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:41,598
Restoril, Elavil, speed,
yohimbe, Zocor, Sonata.

650
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,766
I said just take a couple of Ambien.

651
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,867
Of course you're blacking out.

652
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:48,174
This would black out
the Oakland Raiders.

653
00:32:48,246 --> 00:32:50,214
I'm not blacking out.
Come on.

654
00:32:50,282 --> 00:32:52,273
I just got stuff on my mind.

655
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,841
Did you write a check
for the defense fund?

656
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,352
Who do I make it out to?

657
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,685
The Nabante-Makabeni
defense fund.

658
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,724
These things you get involved with.

659
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:03,694
These are innocent guys.

660
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:05,923
You can't just go rounding people up

661
00:33:05,997 --> 00:33:07,624
because they're foreigners.

662
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:11,032
This town used to open up.
It's become a police state.

663
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:12,126
Nobody cares.

664
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,194
Nobody's doing anything about it.

665
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,763
The Transport Worker Union says
they'll strike

666
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:19,139
against the B-line
and Liberty Bus Lines

667
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,236
if they don't get
an acceptable offer by midnight.

668
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,406
We hear from Cary?

669
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,312
ROSS:
Yeah. He's not coming.

670
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,351
Where do we seat Dick Holbrooke?

671
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:28,681
Oh, I don't know.

672
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:31,381
Next to Stephanopoulos.
Wherever he is.

673
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,856
I want you to messenger
another invitation

674
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,688
to Elliot Sharansky right away.

675
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,387
Who?

676
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:40,556
You don't know who he is?
Huge money guy?

677
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:43,362
Do you read anything
besides "Entertainment Weekly"?

678
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:44,527
- No.
- Look him up.

679
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:45,728
Find him.
Come on.

680
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:49,740
Eli. You were gonna look
at my head shots today with me.

681
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:52,675
Michael. I forgot.
We were supposed to meet.

682
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,268
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

683
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:56,211
Ross, Michael is a model.

684
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:59,375
- And he's an actor. Writer.
- Yeah, I know.

685
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:02,078
Maybe we could hook him up
with some agents.

686
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,054
You're late.
They're in your office.

687
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,419
- Who?
- The committee.

688
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,720
You agreed to some meeting in Harlem.

689
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,692
Oh, shit.
I blanked.

690
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:11,285
You're doing a lot of that.

691
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:13,194
Don't be such a smartass, huh?

692
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,858
Just back me up.
Don't cut me down.

693
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:16,866
Jesus.

694
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,699
I'm sorry, Michael.
Come to this thing tonight.

695
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:21,102
Oh, hey.
Yeah.

696
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,697
A lot of people to meet.
We got Cary Launer.

697
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,936
No, we can't have the small room.

698
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,478
Tonight, then?
Thanks, Eli.

699
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:30,537
Because we agreed from the beginning

700
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,242
that we have the main floor.

701
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:35,650
What's this?
Who are you talking to?

702
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,312
Romeo at the Palm.

703
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,619
They want to move us
to the small room.

704
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,750
- Some event for fashion week.
- Oh, no.

705
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:42,758
Elsa Nye wants...

706
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,318
Oh, her? That whore.
She used to work for me.

707
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,558
I fucked her.
She's always trying to...

708
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:50,226
Hello, Romeo?
Listen, honey.

709
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,201
This is a special event.

710
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,737
Hello? Hello?

711
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:55,397
Romeo?

712
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:58,340
Damn it! I'm on hold.
What's the matter with you?

713
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,002
Can't you be in sync with me?

714
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:02,012
I don't know what direction
you're going.

715
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,846
Just call Cary. He's gonna try
to get out of this thing.

716
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,681
SANTANA: Death of
"Assassina" star Jilli Hopper.

717
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,345
Who'd they say died?

718
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:13,016
I don't know.
I'm trying to find Cary.

719
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,958
WOMAN: We're late, Eli.
We've got to get to Harlem.

720
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,621
Well, we all got to get
to Harlem, honey.

721
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,866
Black people under this mayor
and under this government.

722
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:30,203
Taught to fear us and hate us.

723
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,833
That's what tonight's about.

724
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,437
Eli, don't spin out of control
when we see Reverend Blunt.

725
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:38,676
- It took a lot of hard work...
- I'm gonna be a pussycat!

726
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,547
Come on.

727
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:43,985
Besides, all the brothers love me.

728
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:49,184
REV. BLUNT:
Every couple years,

729
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,490
some white folks come up here
with a plan.

730
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:55,192
You talk about civil liberties,
the Constitution.

731
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:57,734
Those are just words, man.

732
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,896
Our children cannot move freely
through the streets.

733
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:04,567
They round up young black men
and throw the keys away.

734
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:08,237
This is a Warsaw ghetto.
And it is being ignored.

735
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:09,905
We agree, Reverend Blunt.

736
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:13,382
And we want to do something.
We want to make a beachhead.

737
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:14,918
And your little tea party,

738
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:17,511
your little cocktail party does that?

739
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,025
To protest one incident?
I don't think so.

740
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:23,890
We will not be in attendance.

741
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:25,395
Reverend.

742
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:28,955
Reverend Blunt, you have
a lot of charisma, sir.

743
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:33,265
But you do not have a voice
below 125th Street.

744
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,465
Wouldn't it be nice if you were heard

745
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,405
all the way down on Wall Street?

746
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:40,638
What do we get
out of sanctioning you?

747
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,112
Reverend, our coalition is
made up of people

748
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:44,409
from the media.

749
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:46,074
We have thrown in our lot

750
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,913
with the Upper West Side
Triangulation.

751
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,783
You know what that got us?

752
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:51,116
- Bupkes.
- Amen.

753
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,555
By "Upper West Side,"
you do mean Jewish?

754
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,957
Where were they when we needed them?

755
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,427
We have been fighting
the mayor alone.

756
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,397
Everybody.
Everyone went establishment.

757
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:05,198
So no, we do not need the
laying on of sympathetic hands.

758
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,103
We have God.
We don't need friends!

759
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,901
- What we need...
- Is exposure.

760
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:11,601
You need to be heard.

761
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,645
You need to be heard
below 125th Street.

762
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:18,478
You need to be heard all the way
from Oakland to Washington.

763
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,745
Publicity.
That's what you need.

764
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:22,581
Otherwise you're just gonna be

765
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,487
another babbling voice in the dark.

766
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:26,990
Names, Reverend.

767
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:29,549
You need names
in order to beget power.

768
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:32,391
You need names.
And we can give them to you.

769
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,557
We got the Kennedys,
which begets the DNC,

770
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,430
which begets the ACLU,

771
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,094
which begets
the "New York Times."

772
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,159
We got artists.

773
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:42,570
We got stars, Reverend Blunt.
Stars.

774
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,473
These days they're the only ones
catch the light.

775
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:46,874
The only ones.

776
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:49,277
You come tonight,
and you're gonna get me.

777
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:51,611
And you're gonna get
the people I know.

778
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,651
The people I know.
Yes, sir.

779
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:56,983
I know everyone.
Now, what is that worth to you?

780
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,785
Sir, is that worth one night?

781
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:03,486
Give me one night.
I'm gonna give you recognition.

782
00:38:03,528 --> 00:38:06,463
So you can do something
for your people

783
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:09,091
instead of just howling in the dark.

784
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,134
I came here today

785
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:18,141
because of something
that happened in my lifetime.

786
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:22,542
I marched with Reverend King, sir.

787
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:28,143
I held his hand,
and we walked through the fire.

788
00:38:31,623 --> 00:38:33,056
Take my hand.

789
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,319
Come on, man.

790
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,224
Why don't you just take my hand?

791
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:43,790
Mr. Wurman,
I have 10 events tonight.

792
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:46,632
Now, what makes yours so special?

793
00:38:46,704 --> 00:38:50,162
Oh, stars, Reverend.

794
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,004
Stars.

795
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,168
Such as?

796
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,838
Such as Cary Launer.

797
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:57,005
The movie star?

798
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:58,343
The movie star.
Yeah.

799
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,610
Well, we have Jesus and Allah.

800
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:02,517
I believe they are bigger names.

801
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,679
I don't know.

802
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:05,586
I think you been
on the street too long.

803
00:39:05,657 --> 00:39:08,387
I think even them folk need
a little press these days.

804
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,949
Competition is strong.

805
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:13,486
Attention spans are getting
shorter and shorter.

806
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,828
You come tonight, Reverend.

807
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,664
You come and you make a showing.

808
00:39:18,736 --> 00:39:21,227
You bring people together.

809
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:27,536
Our elders have prepared lunch.
Would you care to join us?

810
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:28,738
I'm sorry, Reverend.

811
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,680
But I'm supposed to be meeting
my sister-in-law

812
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,774
half an hour ago.

813
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:35,910
You bring your friends down tonight.

814
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,285
We'll see if we can come together.

815
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:41,223
The Jews, the stars,
and all the brothers.

816
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,726
That's called "horse racing," right?

817
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,786
ELI:
Hallelujah.

818
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,402
ELI:
Hi, Angus.

819
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,063
Angus, I'm late.

820
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,006
Eli, Ross called.
You have to call him.

821
00:39:58,076 --> 00:39:59,509
I don't have to do anything.

822
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:01,568
There's a policeman asking for you.

823
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,671
Not now, Angus.
Thank you.

824
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:06,615
There you are.
I know I'm late.

825
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,549
Hey, you.

826
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,087
- I'm so sorry about last night.
- That's okay.

827
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:14,556
That awful play?
It's gonna close in a week.

828
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:15,956
And now I'm late.

829
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:19,622
It's okay.
You're here.

830
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:22,598
I'm so glad to see you.

831
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,931
How are you, Eli?

832
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:25,934
I'm good.

833
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:28,733
My doctor says I have the heart
of a 17-year-old.

834
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,068
[Laughs]

835
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,609
And I know you too well
to believe that.

836
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:36,909
Oh, it's so great to see you.
You're such a tonic.

837
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:39,245
In the cab over here, I was thinking,

838
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,114
"Here I am, gonna see this person.

839
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:44,052
Finally get to be straight
with someone.

840
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:46,852
Don't have to sidestep
and all that stuff."

841
00:40:46,924 --> 00:40:48,687
I'm so tired of it.

842
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,024
How you doing, honey?

843
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,084
I'm okay.

844
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:54,427
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

845
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,263
Everything strikes me
as being funny these days.

846
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,270
I know what you mean.

847
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,202
I have something for you.

848
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,674
Adrian wanted you to have this.

849
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:12,181
It's your favorite book, isn't it?

850
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,981
I think you gave it to him
when he graduated college.

851
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,325
You can have it, honey.

852
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:24,725
Eli, please.

853
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:28,188
I don't know that I have the strength

854
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,667
to talk about
my little brother, Vicki.

855
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:35,297
We both miss him, Eli.

856
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:41,403
Well, it's been three years, sweetie.

857
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,913
You have to just finally...

858
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:48,918
I saw you last night
working the room.

859
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:51,511
You looked ashen and miserable.

860
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,181
Hustling.

861
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:56,852
Well, I'm a PR guy, honey.
That's what I do.

862
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:59,192
I get items in papers.

863
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,424
I suck up to celebrities.

864
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:02,955
But every once in a while,

865
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,525
I get to do something worthwhile.

866
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:07,696
Like this benefit tonight.

867
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:10,036
I worry about you, E.

868
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,267
I do.

869
00:42:11,342 --> 00:42:14,778
What is this about, Vicki?

870
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:17,815
Do you mind if we go upstairs?

871
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:20,544
I don't want to melt in here.

872
00:42:20,618 --> 00:42:22,449
Of course.

873
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,926
It's a nonsmoking room, Eli.

874
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,728
Oh.

875
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,359
Well...

876
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:43,372
Why you crying, Vicki?

877
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:46,069
'Cause you're almost your brother.

878
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,373
I'm a third of him.

879
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,442
I came here with an absurd plan.

880
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,610
You did?
What is it?

881
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:57,984
I'm a woman on a mission.

882
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:59,613
Which is?

883
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,454
Remember after his funeral?

884
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:04,824
The things you said to me about
all the things you wanted.

885
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:07,262
Children and quiet.

886
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,129
Oh, I don't know.

887
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:15,568
Why don't you have someone
in your life?

888
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,608
Anyone, E.
Why?

889
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:21,839
Because everyone's alone
in this town.

890
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,972
Is that your motto?

891
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:28,485
The PR man's creed.
"Everyone's alone in this town"?

892
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,782
You were going to change
the world, Eli.

893
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:35,554
To do what I do,
you got to harden yourself.

894
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:39,995
Until what?
You're barely recognizable?

895
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:41,929
Oh, come on.

896
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,435
You shouldn't worry about me.
I'm tough.

897
00:43:49,874 --> 00:43:52,843
And I came here 'cause
I thought you might be ready.

898
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:54,172
Ready to split?

899
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,304
- Yes.
- Oh.

900
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,972
Yeah.

901
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,549
Not so easy.

902
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,608
- Yes, it is, sweetie.
- No.

903
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:03,654
You just forgot the route.

904
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:05,154
No.
You don't understand.

905
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,746
They get you under contract,

906
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:09,418
then they close the escape clauses.

907
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,825
And the bridges.
And then the tunnels.

908
00:44:11,896 --> 00:44:15,161
And then you're stuck.
Forever.

909
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,361
Do you think we'll ever know
why your brother killed himself?

910
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:25,335
Some people just get tired, honey.

911
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:27,001
You know?

912
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:30,611
And they quit early.

913
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:36,275
- And the others survive.
- Mmh.

914
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:39,755
Is that what we're doing, E?
We're surviving?

915
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:43,282
Don't underestimate it.
It's harder than it looks.

916
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:45,659
You come to my benefit tonight,
you'd see.

917
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,992
You gonna come?

918
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,064
I'll come if you want me to.

919
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,035
I do.

920
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:56,835
Remember when the three of us
marched in Selma?

921
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:59,205
Oh, you were this
little 12-year-old.

922
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,938
You were so brave.

923
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:04,277
All that early promise.

924
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:06,680
Maybe that's the reason
I'm not leaving.

925
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:09,413
I want to just live up to some of it.

926
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:16,722
You know, I squandered whole
sections of my life, Vicki.

927
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:20,730
I'm just trying to...

928
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:24,825
I'm trying not to
dribble all of it away.

929
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:30,470
Well, I have a pass.

930
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,101
How's that work?
Now, honey.

931
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:34,667
What are we doing?

932
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:37,805
What are we doing?

933
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:39,315
I wish I knew.

934
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:41,248
[Sighs]

935
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,879
You came up from Virginia to get me.

936
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,753
Ridiculous, isn't it?

937
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:50,488
Yes.

938
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,332
And just about...

939
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,733
[Voice breaking] sweetest
thing anyone's ever done.

940
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:08,008
E?

941
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:12,679
Hey.

942
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:16,042
[Sighs]

943
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:24,160
Um, honey,
we're not thinking clearly.

944
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:25,195
No.
Maybe we are.

945
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:27,253
No.

946
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:29,356
Utterly clear.

947
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,665
But...

948
00:46:33,737 --> 00:46:35,728
- But...
- But...

949
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:40,102
But you're my brother's wife.

950
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,475
Widow.

951
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:52,820
I got so much work to do
before tonight.

952
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:59,189
You coming?

953
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:01,063
Don't worry.

954
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,999
I'll be there.
It's okay.

955
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:05,899
All right, then.

956
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,070
[Door opens, closes]

957
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:14,907
ELI: I don't care if police
are looking to talk to me.

958
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,378
We have a benefit.

959
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,883
No, Ross. Listen to me.
I want to know who's singing.

960
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,781
Is it Jon Hendricks?
Is it Annie Ross?

961
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:23,183
Is it Bernadette Peters?

962
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:27,714
I want to know by the time I get
to Sandy's office, you hear?

963
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:28,951
- Yeah.
- [Laughter]

964
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:31,221
It's a black thing.
Get a black person.

965
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:32,227
Oh!

966
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:33,661
I'm so sorry.

967
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,330
Hi, Rita.

968
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,232
You mean I don't have to wait?

969
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:40,361
Oh!

970
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,098
What is it?
Hanukkah?

971
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:45,438
He wanted to see you.
And you have several messages.

972
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,670
Your office needs you
to call A.S.A.P.

973
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:49,576
NAPIER:
I have to see you first.

974
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:50,579
Get in here now.

975
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,741
What's the matter?
My cholesterol too high?

976
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,078
What happened last night?

977
00:47:54,151 --> 00:47:56,210
I don't know.
What do you mean?

978
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:59,723
You called me at dawn screaming,
"Jilli Hopper! Jilli Hopper!"

979
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:02,553
I was?
Well, I had a bad night.

980
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:04,254
Well, it's all over the news.

981
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:07,422
"TV Star O.D.'s
in East Side Hotel."

982
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:09,363
What do you mean?

983
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,731
What the hell is the matter with you?

984
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:14,293
You told me you were
with Jilli Hopper

985
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:16,066
and there were all these drugs.

986
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,402
I don't remember.

987
00:48:17,474 --> 00:48:20,204
- The woman is dead, Eli.
- Oh, no.

988
00:48:20,277 --> 00:48:21,539
She O.D.'d.

989
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:24,137
Did you see her do it?

990
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,705
[Sighs]

991
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:27,580
I don't know.

992
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:29,084
Listen, sweetie.

993
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:31,383
I'm your pal.

994
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:33,889
What is this?

995
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,853
I been so tired lately.

996
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:39,521
Maybe we should
check you in somewhere.

997
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:42,430
Shut up for a minute.
I just got to think.

998
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:43,591
I have to think.

999
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,567
Oh, man.

1000
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,135
Oh, poor girl.

1001
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,504
She was just doing fine.

1002
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:53,008
She was sleeping.

1003
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,705
And I left.
I think.

1004
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,337
You think?

1005
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:58,403
She's a friend.

1006
00:48:58,515 --> 00:49:00,847
She had gotten herself
into little troubles.

1007
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:03,011
I bailed her out of Manhattan South,

1008
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:05,578
and then I gave her a ride
back to her hotel,

1009
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,749
Hotel D'Orsay, and I left.

1010
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:10,123
Look, don't be covering
for Cary Launer.

1011
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,287
Oh, Cary's got nothing
to do with this.

1012
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,456
Oh, yeah?
I know he was screwing her.

1013
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:17,022
I know everything
about everyone, sweetheart.

1014
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:18,363
He sent her to me.

1015
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:20,960
She had gastritis
or the clap or something.

1016
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:23,802
I know he's your bread
and butter, but he's a bad guy.

1017
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:27,207
I don't remember anything.

1018
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:29,670
I can't believe she's dead.

1019
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:32,113
Were you doing smack
with this girl, Eli?

1020
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:34,582
Were you having a party?
If you saw something...

1021
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,678
- I didn't see a thing.
- Okay.

1022
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:40,583
It's the medication, Sandy.

1023
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,149
I'm just mixing all these pills.

1024
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:45,889
You take sleeping pills,
you don't sleep.

1025
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:49,455
You get turned.
You get turned around inside.

1026
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:52,798
- I'm mixing the wrong pills.
- You are the wrong pill.

1027
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,930
RITA: Mr. Wurman,
your assistant is on the phone.

1028
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:58,668
He said to tell you
Jon Hendricks is confirmed.

1029
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:02,143
He also said Elliot Sharansky
has been trying you all day.

1030
00:50:02,212 --> 00:50:03,679
Thank you, Rita.

1031
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:04,679
Thank you.

1032
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,340
- Sharansky.
- Yeah.

1033
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,180
Big-time society Jew.

1034
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:09,480
That's the one.

1035
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:12,522
You hitting him up for money
for your African brothers?

1036
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,580
Come on.
Don't say it like that.

1037
00:50:14,658 --> 00:50:16,421
You know what's going on.

1038
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:18,586
The mayor goes on a roundup,

1039
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:21,995
hands all the colored who don't
have green cards over to INS.

1040
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:24,000
You think that's right, Sandy?

1041
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,901
I can walk in the park
without getting mugged.

1042
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,302
Yeah, right.
Quality of life. I know.

1043
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:30,465
Whose life?

1044
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:31,838
How about yours, pal?

1045
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:34,309
You're like something
out of Yellowstone.

1046
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:36,505
Oh, come on.
I'm not an easy patient.

1047
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,343
But don't go busting my balls.

1048
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:41,543
It's not about being easy.
It's about keeping you alive.

1049
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,848
- I'm having a bad time.
- Take it easy.

1050
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:45,548
This is not a joke.

1051
00:50:45,622 --> 00:50:47,886
I don't know what happened
to that girl.

1052
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,950
- Take it easy.
- Don't "easy" me.

1053
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,859
Come on.

1054
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,696
I don't know what I'm seeing
half the time.

1055
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,600
I don't remember things.

1056
00:50:59,703 --> 00:51:02,638
I can't sleep unless I got
a gallon of pills in me.

1057
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:05,836
Oh, something's fucking wrong.

1058
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:08,207
This is not my life.

1059
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:11,372
This is not my life.
I can't...

1060
00:51:11,448 --> 00:51:13,848
[Voice breaking]
I can't live like this.

1061
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:16,852
NAPIER:
Look. Here.

1062

Dr. Feelgood.

1065
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:32,664
Maybe it's your fucking fault
I'm turning into Janis Joplin.

1066
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:37,136
DR. FAHRI:
We'll just look around

1067
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:39,334
and see what's what down there.

1068
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:45,241
I'll tell you what's down there.
Missed chances and wasted times.

1069
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:48,807
That's what you're gonna find
in my reproductive system.

1070
00:51:48,886 --> 00:51:51,377
Maybe the keys to my car.

1071
00:51:51,455 --> 00:51:53,423
Oh, yeah?
What do you drive?

1072
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,958
She's got such a nice
bedside manner, Sandy.

1073
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:57,653
Maybe I should marry her.

1074
00:51:57,728 --> 00:52:00,196
You always want to marry women
who hurt you?

1075
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:02,289
Oh, honey.

1076
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:06,496
What you're doing to my penis
is a whole lot less horrible

1077
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,299
than most people I know do to it.

1078
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:09,669
I'm glad to hear that,

1079
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,005

is gonna hurt.

I don't feel so great.

1082
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,740
Last time I was in Athens, Georgia,

1083
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:26,051
I cried 'cause my mama
and daddy lived and died.

1084
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:29,286
There's a girl named Victoria
in Virginia.

1085
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,055
And I should've married her
but my brother did.

1086
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:36,566
I graduated from Harvard Law
fourth in my class.

1087
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,157
But I never practiced

1088
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:42,069
because I wanted to suck cock
in Hollywood too badly.

I have to keep an eye on.

You promised me a full year

Get in the car.

1104

No. It's over.

Before you go, Cary,
I just want to ask one question.

1242
01:00:26,736 --> 01:00:30,433
You think if Jilli Hopper
hadn't come to New York with you

1243
01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:33,271
on your little field trip
to an opium den,

1244
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:37,803
you think maybe, just maybe,
she'd be alive today?

1245
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:40,879
What are you saying?

1246

Go on.

01:00:47,624 --> 01:00:49,615

Come on, Cary.

01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:11,279
You're always gonna need someone
to pick up the pieces

with no real center.

anything and then cover it up.

someone like that?

you have so much power.

1407
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:12,723
You use it wisely.

1408
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:15,491
I would say the same to you,
my friend.

1409
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,369
Did someone kill that girl
over a toy?

1410
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:23,030
Eli, you're not thinking clearly.

1411
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:26,472
We're civic leaders, Eli.
[Chuckles]

1412
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,407
Harry Gould back there is a rabbi.

1413
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:30,912
Tom Hiler is on the board
of the ACLU.

1414
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,642
We're concerned about the
political future of our state,

1415
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:36,412
which, by the way,
is very precarious.

1416
01:09:36,486 --> 01:09:39,216
A future which we all care
very deeply about.

1417
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:43,156
Well, if you care,
you'll be there tonight.

1418
01:09:43,226 --> 01:09:44,921
You'll be there with Reverend Blunt.

1419
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:47,724
And you'll take a stand.

1420
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,528
Eli, hey.

1421
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:54,593
- Eli.
- Who are these people?

1422
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:55,830
Give them the thing.

1423
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,339
If you've got the thing,
give it to them.

1424
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,466
Get them to come.

1425
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:06,781
Jesus.

1426
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:09,875
[Breathing heavily] Cary.

1427
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:10,884
Listen.

1428
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:13,581
You got to call me back soon.
Please.

1429
01:10:13,656 --> 01:10:15,817
Please, just call me.

1430
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:49,380
[Telephone ringing]

1431
01:10:58,067 --> 01:10:59,159
[Answering machine beeps]

1432
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:01,669
ROSS: Eli, where are you?
I'm at the Palm.

1433
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:03,932
I put off the cops
till tomorrow afternoon.

1434
01:11:04,006 --> 01:11:06,941
You've got to get down here.
Elsa is taking over.

1435
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,840
I can't stop her.

1436
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:16,113
Hey, Elsa. You came.
How touching.

1437
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:19,154
E., they bumped us
to the small room.

1438
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:21,849
No, Romeo. No.

1439
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,482
No. Forget it.

1440
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:27,154
I want you to move these tables
out of here right now, Romeo.

1441
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:29,857
Eli, you have fewer people.
It's fashion week.

1442
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:32,628
I have "InStyle" magazine.

1443
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:35,694
We are not huddling in that
bar mitzvah room upstairs

1444
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:38,001
because of your tragic causes.

1445
01:11:38,074 --> 01:11:41,043
You used to work for me.
I trained you. I screwed you.

1446
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,941
If you didn't scare me in the sack,

1447
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,604
you ain't gonna scare me now.

1448
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,944
That was a hundred years ago,
big shot.

1449
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:49,348
You're a lot sadder now.
I am a lot tougher.

1450
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:52,114
Tonight the Palm is mine.
I'm not asking.

1451
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,213
I may be old, but I can still hurt.

1452
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:58,283
Now, you think
about how I can hurt you.

1453
01:11:58,394 --> 01:11:59,656
Jesus.
Come on, Eli.

1454
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,663
Romeo, I want you to move her
out of here.

1455
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:03,995
And I want you to rearrange
this room.

1456
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:07,900
Because it's not 70 people.
It's the whole goddamn world.

1457
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:11,303
Eli, I have fashion week.
I have "InStyle."

1458
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:13,308
I have Cary Launer!

1459
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:14,707
He never shows.

1460
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:17,177
Look what you are.
Look what you've become.

1461
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:19,237
Do it, Romeo.

1462
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,850
[Sighs]

1463
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:35,823
ROSS:
It's starting.

1464
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,729
I know.

1465
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:41,626
Uh, where's Jon Hendricks?

1466
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:42,966
He's on his way.

1467
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:46,065
Blunt is here.
I put him in the kitchen.

1468
01:12:46,142 --> 01:12:47,234
Why?

1469
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:52,076
I didn't know what else to do.
He has half a dozen bodyguards.

1470
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:53,581
Where's Cary?

1471
01:12:53,649 --> 01:12:55,776
He coming?

1472
01:12:55,851 --> 01:12:57,910
His doorman says he's still at home.

1473
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,682
He ordered a Mr. Chow's
takeout duck salad,

1474
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:03,385
an echinacea shake,
and some valerian drops.

1475
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:06,656
Valerian drops. Jesus.
I know what that means.

1476
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:08,253
- Just keep trying him.
- Yeah.

1477
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:11,857
And this model kid.

1478
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:15,028
You know. The one I invited.
Michael.

1479
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:18,369
- Yeah. I put him next to you.
- Oh, good.

1480
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:19,840
- Okay.
- Eli, wait a sec.

1481
01:13:19,909 --> 01:13:22,173
- I want to say something.
- Oh, not now.

1482
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:23,939
No. Look.

1483
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:26,573
I really have loved working for you.

1484
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:29,243
I even sort of respect you.

1485
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:30,216
But...

1486
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:31,548
Always a "but."

1487
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,781
Where you going?
You gonna be an agent?

1488
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:35,084
No.

1489
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:36,988
Back to Seattle.

1490
01:13:37,059 --> 01:13:41,223
I miss quaint and grunge and rain.

1491
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:44,563
[Sighs] Don't we all.

1492
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,261
That's a smart move, kid.

1493
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:49,429
Come on.

1494
01:13:49,505 --> 01:13:52,099
[Mid-tempo jazz playing]

1495
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:54,301
I want to know
who's working the door.

1496
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:55,968
I hate those flowers.

1497
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:58,377
They look like they died last Easter.

1498
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:01,243
George.

1499
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:03,547
You're here.
Very good seeing you.

1500
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:06,019
- Good seeing you, Gay.
- Hi.

1501
01:14:07,523 --> 01:14:09,616
Hey, Ross, how are you?

1502
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:13,594
Ah. Welcome, Reverend.
They take care of you?

1503
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:16,153
I have a long night.
A lot of stops.

1504
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,359
- I know.
- Any fun people showing up?

1505
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,459
Well, I hear Gandhi might stop by.

1506
01:14:20,536 --> 01:14:22,333
But that might only be a rumor.

1507
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:25,805
Yeah, he was good in that movie.
But this ain't India.

1508
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:27,502
Are they feeding you?

1509
01:14:27,576 --> 01:14:29,908
Anybody working?
Let's get some more shrimp.

1510
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:31,571
- Sharansky's arrived.
- Yeah.

1511
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:33,046
He's in a limo out front.

1512
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,709
But he won't come in
until he knows he's safe.

1513
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:37,013
Safe?

1514
01:14:37,086 --> 01:14:38,951
It's always about safety with him.

1515
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:41,683
I'd like to know
what that man is so scared of.

1516
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:42,689
I don't know.

1517
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:46,250
Maybe he's afraid Mustafa here
is gonna ask him to dance.

1518
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:58,468
Is there a problem?

1519
01:14:58,574 --> 01:15:01,099
This is Berger.
He does security for us.

1520
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:03,407
No way can I let my man
in this place.

1521
01:15:03,479 --> 01:15:05,208
You can't?

1522
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:08,250
I don't have enough exits
to make a clean retreat.

1523
01:15:08,317 --> 01:15:12,378
You are gonna be a lot safer
in there than you are in a car.

1524
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:14,354
You can't sit in a limo all night.

1525
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,584
Elliot, sweetheart, it's the Palm.

1526
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:19,651
You're not walking into
a PLO training camp.

1527
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:23,789
Think of Jimmy Carter.
Anwar Sadat. Camp David.

1528
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:25,629
Elliot.
Let me help you.

1529
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,396
I know Jimmy Carter.

1530
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:29,630
Eli, believe me,
you're no Jimmy Carter.

1531
01:15:29,705 --> 01:15:30,694
We look alike.

1532
01:15:30,773 --> 01:15:33,139
Don't know why I like you, but I do.

1533
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:35,040
You're the little Jew who could.

1534
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,011
Don't worry about the guns.
They're just show.

1535
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,480
They always love their guns.

1536
01:15:43,986 --> 01:15:47,251
- It's so good to see you.
- How are you?

1537
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,056
Well, here we are.

1538
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,692
Okay, gentlemen.
Here's the story.

1539
01:15:59,802 --> 01:16:03,499
We don't have much time.
So here's how it's gonna work.

1540
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,803
I'm gonna introduce you.
Both of you.

1541
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,866
That would hardly be appropriate.

1542
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:10,036
You do not have the right stature.

1543
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:12,080
- Stature?
- I agree, Mr. Sharansky.

1544
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:15,048
I think it's more effective
if I speak first.

1545
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:17,210
No. We never agreed on that.

1546
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:18,913
Whatever the order, I go first.

1547
01:16:18,988 --> 01:16:21,252
"B," I need to be
out of here by 9:45.

1548
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:23,621
And "C," Cary Launer introduces us.

1549
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:24,624
Cary?

1550
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:26,160
That's a deal-breaker.

1551
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:29,459
He is planning on coming
but not necessarily speaking.

1552
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:31,465
You never know with him.

1553
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,797
Not talking?
Then Rev. Blunt is walking.

1554
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:35,427
Nada con nada equals nada.

1555
01:16:35,504 --> 01:16:37,233
If Reverend Blunt leaves, I leave.

1556
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:40,901
I'm not here to be the lone
schmuck on page 6 of the "Post."

1557
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,911
You can say that again.
We can leave together.

1558
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:46,675
Guys, I have almost 200

1559
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:49,650
of the most important people
in this town out there,

1560
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:51,777
opinion makers, to honor.

1561
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:54,288
Just think about the cause, will you?

1562
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:56,620
I don't appreciate
standing by the ovens.

1563
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:59,126
The symbolism is unpleasant.
And it's hot.

1564
01:16:59,228 --> 01:17:01,526
And I need to see
Reverend Blunt's speech.

1565
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:03,155
- You what?
- I'm sorry.

1566
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,326
I need to know we're not
going to be humiliated.

1567
01:17:06,402 --> 01:17:09,235
Now, listen. Remember why
we're here, guys. Okay?

1568
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:11,432
Why is it always about the past, huh?

1569
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:12,667
What about today?

1570
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:13,673
Where were you

1571
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:16,336
when I was being thrown
in the back of a paddy wagon?

1572
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:20,678
I was arrested because my people
are experiencing a holocaust.

1573
01:17:20,749 --> 01:17:23,309
Please, don't use that word with me!

1574
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,853
What's tonight all about?
This INS thing.

1575
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:28,617
They've been trying to send us
back to Africa for years.

1576
01:17:28,691 --> 01:17:30,716
You think you have a copyright
on tragedy?

1577
01:17:30,793 --> 01:17:31,919
Now, look, guys...

1578
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:34,019
This has nothing to do with you.

1579
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:37,532
While you were arrested, I was
quietly making phone calls

1580
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:40,625
- on behalf of these gentlemen.
- We are on the same team.

1581
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:43,103
- We are allies.
- He needs to see my speech.

1582
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:47,165
You know what, Mr. Sharansky?
You can kiss my black ass.

1583
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,938
That's Nig for "tokus."

1584
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:54,377
Well, this is impossible.

1585
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:57,510
I don't know why you thought
this could possibly work.

1586
01:17:57,586 --> 01:17:59,679
It can work.
Elliot, please.

1587
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:01,312
- Are you gonna spin me?
- No.

1588
01:18:01,357 --> 01:18:02,585
Don't spin me.

1589
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:04,523
I'm not.
Where you going?

1590
01:18:04,593 --> 01:18:06,925
Elliot, come on.

1591
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:11,366
Reverend, did you have to do that?

1592
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:14,027
Don't you realize
how important this thing is?

1593
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:15,331
Why, Eli?

1594
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:18,999
So you can have something good
you've attached yourself to?

1595
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:21,304
You white people and your guilt.

1596
01:18:21,377 --> 01:18:25,279
The look you all get.
"We're sorry. We love you."

1597
01:18:25,347 --> 01:18:27,440
Eli, I like you.

1598
01:18:27,516 --> 01:18:30,508
But you do not speak
for all these people.

1599
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:31,678
You're a nice man.

1600
01:18:31,754 --> 01:18:34,917
We'll go to a Knicks game
sometime, huh?

1601
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,924
Elliot.

1602
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:37,981
Okay. Thursday.

1603
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,550
Wait.

1604
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,453
Nice to see you.

1605
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:43,157
- Eli.
- Michael.

1606
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,200
I'm gonna get to meet
Cary Launer, right?

1607
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,292
- Oh, sure, you are.
- You look great.

1608
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:50,395
Thank you. You too.
Why don't you sit at the table?

1609
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,500
Hey, Elliot.

1610
01:18:53,575 --> 01:18:55,167
You're not leaving, are you?

1611
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:56,506
Hey, Cary.

1612
01:18:56,578 --> 01:18:58,443
- How are you?
- Well, I don't...

1613
01:18:58,547 --> 01:19:00,481
CARY:
God, this is great, isn't it?

1614
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:02,484
When did we see each other last?

1615
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:03,950
That dull party.

1616
01:19:04,019 --> 01:19:06,385
- It was in Switzerland.
- It was a while ago.

1617
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:09,322
I never heard so much whining
about the deutsche mark.

1618
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,018
Now, come on.
You cannot leave.

1619
01:19:11,093 --> 01:19:13,823
- This is a charade.
- Yeah. But stick around.

1620
01:19:13,896 --> 01:19:15,659
We got a lot of catching up to do.

1621
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:18,325
- We do?
- We never had our lunch.

1622
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,029
By the way, I read your Op-Ed
piece in the "Times" last month.

1623
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:23,162
It was terrific.

1624
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:25,069
Caught a lot of flak about that.

1625
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,836
I'm sure you did.
But you know what?

1626
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:31,903
That's the name of the game.
You told it like it was.

1627
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,743
That's why we're here, isn't it?

1628
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:34,908
Uh, yes.

1629
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:36,780
I gave your piece
to Arianna Huffington.

1630
01:19:36,852 --> 01:19:38,683
She just loved it.

1631
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:41,120
But the trouble is, you can't win.

1632
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:42,521
And I can.

1633
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,025
But I need somebody smarter than me

1634
01:19:45,094 --> 01:19:47,756
to make me look as smart
as I do, and that's you.

1635
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:49,991
That's my thought exactly, Cary.

1636
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:51,532
We should have lunch.

1637
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,693
And I should fill you in
on my thoughts.

1638
01:19:53,769 --> 01:19:57,296
Elliot, please, just do this.
Please.

1639
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:58,600
Only on one condition.

1640
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:00,801
I can't talk to that man back there.

1641
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:03,538
And only if Cary acts as a buffer.

1642
01:20:03,612 --> 01:20:07,378
Cary, you're gonna have to
introduce Blunt and Elliot.

1643
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:09,178
Oh, no, no.
Come on.

1644
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:14,245
Cary, this is the last thing
I will ever ask of you.

1645
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:16,086
E., will you look around?

1646
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,389
Do you think this is important?
This is just another rat fuck.

1647
01:20:19,461 --> 01:20:21,827
I know that.

1648
01:20:21,897 --> 01:20:24,388
But I don't know what else to do.

1649
01:20:26,435 --> 01:20:27,902
God, you're dumber than me.

1650
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:30,871
That would take a lot of work.

1651
01:20:30,939 --> 01:20:32,998
Listen.
I got enemies, Eli.

1652
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:37,572
Some of them are right here
in this room.

1653
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:38,772
I can't protect you.

1654
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:41,839
Didn't she give you something for me?

1655
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:45,019
You're such an actor.

1656
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:49,148
Someone turns on a camera,
you just got to perform.

1657
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,726
I don't know who's on that thing.

1658
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:54,489
But I'm not giving it to anybody.

1659
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:58,329
You think there's something
on that little thing?

1660
01:20:58,433 --> 01:20:59,957
- It's nothing.
- Yeah.

1661
01:21:00,002 --> 01:21:01,867
It's a movie.

1662
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:05,168
If that's how you want to play,
I would get out of town.

1663
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,037
Go find yourself someplace safe

1664
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:09,543
where you can't get into any trouble.

1665
01:21:09,611 --> 01:21:11,579
There are people moving around this

1666
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:14,548
I don't even know about.

1667
01:21:14,616 --> 01:21:16,447
The big three.

1668
01:21:19,054 --> 01:21:20,988
Right this way.

1669
01:21:21,056 --> 01:21:23,217
Cary! Over here!

1670
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:25,726
Mr. Launer, big smile!

1671
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:27,056
Hey, Eli.

1672
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:28,528
Oh, not now.
Please.

1673
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:31,225
We're gonna do a thing
about Jilli Hopper's last night.

1674
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,562
Quite a performer.

1675
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:36,297
I hear that she kept a little
black book or something.

1676
01:21:36,371 --> 01:21:38,305
- I'm sure.
- You know who was in it?

1677
01:21:38,373 --> 01:21:40,864
Mayor Conlin.
Mr. Family Values.

1678
01:21:40,943 --> 01:21:42,968
I'm sure.
They're all in there.

1679
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:46,014
Cardinal O'Connor.
Pat Robertson. Jerry Falwell.

1680
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,844
She claims to have fucked them all.

1681
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:50,578
Eli. We've met before.
I'm Sarah Niles.

1682
01:21:50,652 --> 01:21:52,779
You came to my book party
at Elaine's.

1683
01:21:52,854 --> 01:21:54,412
I was just gonna...

1684
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:57,424
Oh, this is my boyfriend.
Detective Jack Pollan.

1685
01:21:57,492 --> 01:21:59,460
He wanted to meet you.

1686
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:01,654
Listen, Eli.
It's a small department.

1687
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:04,393
Word's out that you're saying
you saw something.

1688
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:07,230
Maybe if you saw
someone do something,

1689
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:09,793
perhaps they saw you, too.

1690
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:12,169
Yeah.
I don't understand.

1691
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:14,607
Are you giving me advice
or something?

1692
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:17,304
It's like "The Cat in the Hat."

1693
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:20,007
You try to fix the mess,
but you make it worse.

1694
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:23,415
Then you call in more cats.
The wrong cats.

1695
01:22:23,485 --> 01:22:25,612
It's life, you know?

1696
01:22:25,687 --> 01:22:27,518
Yeah.

1697
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:29,614
You know, I got to go.

1698
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,488
[Applause]

1699
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,825
Ladies and gentlemen,
Oscar-winner Cary Launer.

1700
01:22:34,896 --> 01:22:37,456
[Applause]

1701
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:39,159
Thank you.

1702
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,796
This is good.
This is very good.

1703
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:46,807
I want to say a couple of things
about how important tonight is.

1704
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:49,435
And how important it is
that we say thank you

1705
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:52,742
to the man who put it
all together, Eli Wurman.

1706
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:55,806
[Applause, Eli gagging]

1707
01:22:57,386 --> 01:22:59,911
A guy who believes in
the history of the coalition

1708
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:01,785
and a very silent guy.

1709
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:04,383
A guy who knows how to
make things happen.

1710
01:23:04,459 --> 01:23:05,892
[Eli breathing heavily]

1711
01:23:05,961 --> 01:23:10,227
A long time ago, there was
a movement in this city.

1712
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:12,699
People came together to be heard.

1713
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,760
[Toilet flushing]

1714
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:23,508
Now, there are two men who,
in very different ways,

1715
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:25,739
have never stopped marching
for freedom

1716
01:23:25,814 --> 01:23:27,338
and fighting for the cause.

1717
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:31,546
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the Reverend Lyle Blunt

1718
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,645
and Elliot Sharansky.

1719
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:36,384
[Applause]

1720
01:23:44,366 --> 01:23:47,301
Hey, E.
I met Cary Launer.

1721
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:48,461
Jeez.

1722
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:51,404
And you. You are the man.
They love you upstairs.

1723
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:53,498
Cary Launer.
Holy shit.

1724
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,202
He is so fucking cool.

1725
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:57,404
So fucking cool.

1726
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,537
He's a god.

1727
01:23:58,647 --> 01:24:00,137
He is a god.

1728
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,742
God of death.
Cary.

1729
01:24:02,818 --> 01:24:06,219
Hey, thanks so much
for bringing me here tonight.

1730
01:24:06,288 --> 01:24:08,449
Oh. Yeah.

1731
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:11,057
[Exhales deeply]

1732
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:12,525
You okay?

1733
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:15,859
This benefit.
It's so much goddamn work.

1734
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,694
For what?
You know?

1735
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:18,698
Yeah.

1736
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:23,329
The worst thing in this world,
Michael, is to know too much.

1737
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:27,739
You want to try and stay na?? Ve.

1738
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,243
It's much better.

1739
01:24:30,312 --> 01:24:32,075
Come on.

1740
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:43,814
? Pack up my care and woe?

1741
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:45,154
? Here I go?

1742
01:24:45,227 --> 01:24:47,889
? Swingin' low?

1743
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:51,330
? Bye-bye, blackbird?

1744
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,731
Hi! Eli.

1745
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:55,099
Fantastic night.
I'll never forget it.

1746
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:57,798
Listen, next Saturday
I'm having the opening...

1747
01:24:57,906 --> 01:24:59,464
Eli, it's great.

1748
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:03,342
Do you think you could get Cary
for the Lincoln Center gala?

1749
01:25:03,412 --> 01:25:05,346
Hey, it's terrific, Eli.

1750
01:25:05,414 --> 01:25:08,349
Listen, we're having
this human-rights-march dinner.

1751
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:15,346
? No one Here can ever try
to understand me?

1752
01:25:15,424 --> 01:25:20,088
? And wHat Hard-luck stories
tHey all Hand me?

1753
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:22,392
You can make a comeback, bubby.

1754
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:26,195
? Make my bed
and ligHt my ligHt?

1755
01:25:26,268 --> 01:25:29,169
? I'll arrive late tonight?

1756
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:33,731
? Blackbird, bye-bye-bye?

1757
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:35,572
? Bye-bye, bye-bye?

1758
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:37,441
? Bye-bye?

1759
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:54,819
ROSS:
Hey, E.

1760
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,462
Look.

1761
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,931
Victoria's over there
waiting for you.

1762
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:12,377
Hey.

1763
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:14,813
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

1764
01:26:14,883 --> 01:26:16,441
Me too.

1765
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:21,245
Let's get out of this madhouse.

1766
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:28,254
I'm so sorry.

1767
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:30,264
- No.
- I really am.

1768
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:31,264
I'm sorry.

1769
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:34,769
Nobody has anything
to be sorry about.

1770
01:26:34,836 --> 01:26:35,768
Well...

1771
01:26:35,837 --> 01:26:38,670
We're still kids, Eli.

1772
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:42,540
Nobody knows what to do
or how to do it.

1773
01:26:42,611 --> 01:26:45,079
It's all just lurching.

1774
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:49,110
- You know?
- Yeah, I guess.

1775
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,414
It's working.

1776
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:56,253
Is it?

1777
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:01,195
Yeah.

1778
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:04,721
Oh, yeah.
I guess it is.

1779
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:10,398
And yet, darling, you look so sad.

1780
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:13,600
Well, no.
I'm not sad.

1781
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:15,506
I'm happy.

1782
01:27:17,045 --> 01:27:19,104
Can't you tell?

1783
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:22,207
Oh.

1784
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:24,775
You're gonna be okay.
You know that?

1785
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:25,785
Okay.

1786
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:28,118
Why don't we just...

1787
01:27:29,357 --> 01:27:33,259
Lurch on out of here
while we still can?

1788
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:39,462
? Here I go?

1789
01:27:39,534 --> 01:27:42,264
? Blackbird?

1790
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:45,932
? Bye-bye?

1791
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:50,341
? Bye-bye?

1792
01:27:50,412 --> 01:27:51,606
I don't know.

1793
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,774
It's changed, I think, this city.

1794
01:27:54,849 --> 01:27:57,818
You feeling sorry for yourself?
That's a new color for you.

1795
01:27:57,919 --> 01:27:59,853
- No.
- [Laughs]

1796
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:01,719
I'm just...

1797
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:06,383
I don't know. Maybe I just
want to leave the party.

1798
01:28:07,262 --> 01:28:09,457
Do you really mean that?

1799
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:12,056
E., are you ready?

1800
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:14,897
I'll tell you the truth.

1801
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:20,499
I don't think I have any more
days like today left in me.

1802
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:22,406
I just don't.

1803
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:31,384
So, you go to bed early
down there in Virginia?

1804
01:28:31,453 --> 01:28:36,516
I mean, the cows and the trees
and all them fresh eggs.

1805
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:40,153
You can have the barn to yourself.

1806
01:28:40,228 --> 01:28:42,093
The barn, huh?

1807
01:28:42,163 --> 01:28:44,597
Yes.
It's very ascetic.

1808
01:28:44,666 --> 01:28:46,031
And monastic.

1809
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:49,798
Yeah, sort of safe distance
from the main house, that it?

1810
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:53,034
Eli, we don't have to...

1811
01:28:53,108 --> 01:28:55,542
There are no conditions here.

1812
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:56,702
I know.
I know.

1813
01:28:56,778 --> 01:28:58,143
It's just friendship.

1814
01:28:58,246 --> 01:28:59,372
Yeah.

1815
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:02,747
But you could come in
for all your meals.

1816
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:06,309
I'll cook.
And there's reading.

1817
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,652
Silence.

1818
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:11,157
Any phones in the barn?

1819
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:13,285
No, but I'll put one in.

1820
01:29:13,361 --> 01:29:15,852
No, don't.
Ever.

1821
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,431
You know...

1822
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:25,100
I got to pack some stuff.

1823
01:29:25,173 --> 01:29:31,339
If you'll wait for me,
we can take the noon train.

1824
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:38,313
Success.
Finally.

1825
01:29:38,386 --> 01:29:39,910
Yeah.

1826
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:41,683
- Okay.
- Okay.

1827
01:29:41,756 --> 01:29:43,246
Okay.

1828
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:50,124
Vicki.

1829
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:10,640
Hey, man, that hurt!

1830
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:18,682
Here you go.

1831
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,849
[Breathing heavily]

1832
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:30,897
Yeah.

1833
01:31:30,965 --> 01:31:33,399
Yes, yes.

1834
01:31:40,308 --> 01:31:42,469
Jesus.

1835
01:31:54,255 --> 01:31:56,655
[Breathing heavily]

1836
01:31:56,724 --> 01:31:58,885
Elmwood is really bouncing back

1837
01:31:58,993 --> 01:32:01,553
from a period of neglect and decay.

1838
01:32:01,596 --> 01:32:04,690
And much of it can be traced
directly back to the 1930s,

1839
01:32:04,766 --> 01:32:07,257
when the automobile
started taking over.

1840
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:10,736
In 1936, Elmwood Avenue
was widened...

1841
01:32:10,805 --> 01:32:13,433
MAN: Everybody,
thank you for being there.

1842
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:15,567
- I'm Bill Press.
- I'm Tucker Carlson.

1843
01:32:15,643 --> 01:32:19,079
Welcome to our special
Groundhog's Day...

1844
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:44,369
Scattered showers.
Thunderstorms tomorrow.

1845
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:46,600
An ugly morning front...

1846
01:32:53,715 --> 01:32:57,776
Thank you very much, everybody.
How you doing, huh?

1847
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:00,616
Thank you. Okay.

1848
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:07,121
Thank you very much, everybody.

1849
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:10,790
JO Y: That was some event
we went to last night.

1850
01:33:10,865 --> 01:33:13,163
REGIS:
Our old great friend Eli Wurman,

1851
01:33:13,234 --> 01:33:16,670
one of the great publicists,
put together a fantastic night.

1852
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:18,171
JO Y:
Everybody was there.

1853
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,503
REGIS:
Lots of celebrities.

1854
01:33:20,575 --> 01:33:21,837
And we were there, too.

1855
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:25,346
- Eli put it all together.
- He has really made a mark.

1856
01:33:25,413 --> 01:33:29,042
Remember he came to the house
for the Super Bowl game?

1857
01:33:29,117 --> 01:33:30,584
He made some chili for us.

1858
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:33,621
No, it wasn't the Super Bowl.
It was the World Series.

1859
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:36,088
It was curry, and I made it.
Oh, God.

1860
01:33:36,157 --> 01:33:39,820
Oh, sorry. But seriously.
Last night, wonderful.

1861
01:33:39,894 --> 01:33:41,225
Cary Launer was there.

1862
01:33:41,296 --> 01:33:44,424
He said he's gonna have
an important announcement soon.

1863
01:33:44,499 --> 01:33:50,563
[Telephone ringing]

1864
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:53,505
We're giving away a cruise
of the Caribbean

1865
01:33:53,574 --> 01:33:55,838
on the Norwegian Cruise Line.

1866
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,844
[Cheers and applause]

1867
01:33:57,946 --> 01:33:59,174
JO Y:
So don't go away.

1868
01:33:59,213 --> 01:34:01,773
REGIS: All right.
What do we have today?

1869
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:05,012
JO Y:
We have Sarah Jessica Parker.

1870
01:34:05,086 --> 01:34:08,681
Plus Nathan Lane.

1871
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:12,351
Emeril Lagasse is going to
show us how to make a jambalaya.

1872
01:34:12,427 --> 01:34:15,362
REGIS:
And also that cute Carson Daly.

1873
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:16,692
All the kids love him.

1874
01:34:16,764 --> 01:34:19,028
[Cheers and applause]

1875
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,763
[Ringing continues]

1876
01:34:30,244 --> 01:34:33,907
[Ringing continues]
