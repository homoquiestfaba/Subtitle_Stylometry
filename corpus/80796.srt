1
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,820
It's so good to have you home
for a night.

2
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,649
I've missed you.

3
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,244
I'm a doctor.
I'm on call.

4
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,688
Dr. Sienna.

5
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,191
I'll be there.

6
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,720
There's an emergency
at the hospital.

7
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,354
- Don't go.
- I gotta go.

8
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,093
Don't go, Frank.

9
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,890
This better be good.

10
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,061
They need you pretty bad.

11
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,759
I can't even make love
to my wife.

12
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,395
You're breakin' my heart.

13
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,604
God, he's lost a lot of blood.

14
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,640
Do the best you can.

15
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,769
We gotta get him to a hospital,
Angelo.

16
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,013
<i>His blood pressure's dropping,</i>
<i>he's in shock.</i>

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,247
<i>He's in shock? I'm in shock!</i>
<i>Nino! Where's the merchandise?</i>

18
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,695
Nino, pay attention!

19
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,596
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,160
What do you want, Doc?

21
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,695
Come on, Frank. Just do your stuff,
all right? Not a day later?

22
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,835
I was doin' like you said.

23
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,137
This guy came out of nowhere
with a twelve gauge.

24
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,875
That's not what I'm askin'.
Where are my diamonds?

25
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,480
He pulled me out of the store window.
They rolled out over the sidewalk.

26
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,847
They shot everybody in the store.
My diamonds end up in the sewer?

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,588
- I got some of them... in my shoe.
- In your shoe?

28
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,528
Look at this.

29
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,843
Bull, you rat bastard!
Son of a bitch!

30
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,744
Nobody robs from me!

31
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,582
- He wasn't gonna tell me about it.
- The undertaker would have found.

32
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,383
Hey, come on. The guy was gonna
die anyway, right?

33
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,484
Jesus.

34
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,722
You did the best you could.
You all right?

35
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,790
Frankie, you all right?

36
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,473
Frankie, show 'em the watches.
That's solid 14 carat gold.

37
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,042
These are real diamonds.

38
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:10,107
Your girl would like that, right?
That, my friend, is 14... touch it.

39
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,309
14 carat gold with diamonds.
You want it, you buy it.

40
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,910
Only the best.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,365
Where you guys goin'?
You want some of this?

42
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,142
What are you doin'?

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,147
I told you to take it to a fence.
Not decorate your car with it.

44
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,183
We thought we'd sell it here
for the afternoon.

45
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,014
I'll take your eyes out. You sellin'
merchandice on the street.

46
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,015
Well, there's plenty of them,
Mr. D.

47
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,120
Who's your girlfriend?

48
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,251
You know, I vouched for him.
He's Frankie.

49
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,731
Yeah, see I mean, look
there's end of the shift.

50
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,424
There's 40 guys out here with
paychecks in their pockets...

51
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,798
and buy somethin' for their wives
or their girlfriends.

52
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,335
Danny and I take all the risk,
and that leaves more on your end.

53
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,963
Ang?

54
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,742
Make sure you make that
numbers drop on time, all right?

55
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,745
Absolutely.

56
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,119
Oh, Jesus.

57
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,503
Frank!

58
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,869
- Papa, what...
- Why are you doing this?

59
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,309
Selling stolen stuff!

60
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,782
No, wait. Mr. Sienna, it's
not stolen. We didn't steal it.

61
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,409
We're just sellin' it for a friend.

62
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,146
And it's good prices
for the guys here.

63
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,324
You get that stuff out of here!

64
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,790
- Pop, calm down, will you?
- No! Go!!

65
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,258
- Hey, come on!
- Pop! What are you doin', Pop?

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,489
Is this your way of makin' money
for college?

67
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,424
We're sellin' things. What are you
gettin' so bent out of shape?

68
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,864
You're gonna end up
just like them.

69
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,447
That's great. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Sienna.

70
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,048
I've got fifteen trucks out there
waiting to pour.

71
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,454
They're puttin' the scaffolds up
as fast as they can, Mr. D.

72
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,892
But not fast enough, or else we
wouldn't have to drive down here.

73
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,429
Maybe what you need is
another tune-up, huh?

74
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,642
You see the men out there?

75
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,712
They got food on the table
because of me.

76
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,949
Their children have shoes
on their feet because of me.

77
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,012
They have jobs because of me.

78
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,485
Mr. D...

79
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,121
The bridge. The concrete.
That was all my concrete.

80
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,323
I built the bridge.
And I built you.

81
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,404
You have this nice Union job.
You think you got it by accident?

82
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,467
I put you there.

83
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,242
And the only thing
I ever asked you...

84
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:31,814
was to remember that
time is money.

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,950
Leo!

86
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,383
Jimmy, hang in there!

87
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,905
Everybody down!

88
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:04,108
- Everybody clear out of the way!
- Let's go! Move!

89
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,615
Let's go! You, go!
Clear!

90
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,516
Nicky, look at this.

91
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,562
Your men are walkin' out.

92
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,100
It's that damn shop steward,
Sienna.

93
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,067
Mr. D., he's always
makin' trouble.

94
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,006
- The grunts do whatever he tells.
- They should do what you tell them.

95
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,439
Get outta here.

96
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,547
- I'm sorry, Mr. D.
- Get outta here.

97
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,816
- It's Sienna.
- All right.

98
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,159
What the hell do you
think you're doin'?

99
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,857
At the speed we are, it's a matter
of time before a guy gets killed.

100
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,836
- You know that, Maury.
- What you know is what I tell you.

101
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,668
Now, I want your men back up
there to fix it.

102
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,571
You fix it. I'm takin' my men
off of this bridge!

103
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,344
You go tell your bosses, and
you know who I'm talkin' about...

104
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,886
my men aren't going to die
so they can line their pockets!

105
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,155
That's better.

106
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,869
Joe's wife called me
about the accident.

107
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,546
She told me he almost fell.
Somebody's gonna get killed.

108
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,017
Genaro?

109
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,687
Genaro, what is it?

110
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,059
You're hurt.

111
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,056
- Ma, it's nothing. It's nothing.
- Oh... yu're hurt.

112
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:06,002
I don't know why I bother to
do this anymore.

113
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,605
He's ended up worse than a thief.

114
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,535
Frank is here for dinner.

115
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,870
I don't want him in my home.
You tell him to leave.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,044
We don't takes orders
from nobody.

117
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,745
I know it was the best thing.

118
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,021
- I don't know.
- Wash your hands.

119
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,055
I love you, Nonie. I love your sauce,
but I gotta go.

120
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,159
Always Danny gotta go!
Where you gotta go?

121
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,888
Well, you know, I thought I'd go
to the father and give confession...

122
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,554
and then see if the nuns
need any help.

123
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,563
Ah, non fredo.

124
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,004
Jesus, let me look at that. Will you
get me the needle and thread?

125
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,379
Jesus. You should've gone to the
emergency room, Pop.

126
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,151
- That's what I got you for.
- Drink. This is gonna hurt.

127
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,943
Okay.

128
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,384
Sorry.

129
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,023
My father make better grappa.

130
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,731
I heard about what happened, Pop.
You shouldn't make waves like that.

131
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,200
It's honest work, Frankie.
Remember that.

132
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,530
Pop, it gets noticed. I'm just tryin' to
look out for you.

133
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,371
I mean, don't you want somethin'
better than this? A nice house?

134
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,274
It was good enough for you
growing up.

135
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,545
Those men you work for with
he 50 thousand dollar Cadillac's...

136
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,548
with the big rolls of cash.

137
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,346
Do you know what's gonna
happen to them?

138
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:32,423
They're dead. No future.
No dreams.

139
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,320
Nothing.

140
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,422
- You had a dream.
- Pop, stay still.

141
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,227
You had a dream, Frankie.
Ever since you were little, you...

142
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,904
Yeah, I know, Pop. I have a dream.
I want to be a doctor.

143
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,337
But it takes money to be a doctor.
You gotta go to school.

144
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,200
- Wait a minute, Pop.
- I...

145
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,579
What are you doin'?

146
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,478
I know it's not much.

147
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,619
Pop, I can't take this.

148
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,594
Look, I know what I'm doin'.

149
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,929
I'm gonna work, make enough money
and then I'm gonna get out.

150
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,869
I know these guys.

151
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,870
Once they think they own you,
that's it.

152
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,677
You know, I never get that.

153
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,186
Hey, boys!

154
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,889
I'm hitting the tables.

155
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,159
Pete, good to see you.

156
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,459
Vamos, fill me in.

157
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,467
Why do Italians hate
Jehovah Witnesses?

158
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,405
I don't know. Why do Italians hate
Jehovah Witnesses?

159
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,545
They hate all witnesses.

160
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,111
Bravo!

161
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,047
Forget about the Ice Queen,
Frankie.

162
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,954
She's out of your league.
She's a college girl.

163
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,354
Frankie here's been to college.
Right, Frankie?

164
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,827
Forget about her. I don't care
if you are freakin' Einstein.

165
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,990
Every guy in this place tried to
launch that boat.

166
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,304
Hey.

167
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,879
Somethin' I can do for you?

168
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:17,219
The question is,
what can I do for you?

169
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,684
Look, I'm here to sing.
It's what I get paid to do.

170
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,554
So don't waste my time with
your dumb lines, all right?

171
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,222
All right. No more dumb lines.

172
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,594
- Would you like to go out?
- I never go out with the customers.

173
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,402
Well, how about if I promise
never to come here again?

174
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,042
That's very clever, but I'm not
lookin' for a mobster boyfriend.

175
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,715
You're all morons.

176
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:48,885
And, even if I was,
you wouldn't be him.

177
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,923
I'm Frank Sienna.

178
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,825
I'm sorry about the dumb line.

179
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,722
I'm an idiot.

180
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,765
Lorina Ryan.

181
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,166
Lorina Ryan,
you have a beautiful voice.

182
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,742
- It's an okay voice.
- No, it's really terrific.

183
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,212
It's too good for this place.

184
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,539
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

185
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,287
So, I'm doin' pretty good,
right?

186
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,547
Not bad. I am,
still sittin' here.

187
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,084
Right. Right.

188
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,260
So, I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

189
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,730
You're not that far ahead.

190
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,508
What time is it?

191
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,648
It's late.

192
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,421
Hey, weren't you supposed
to drop that off last night?

193
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,461
It's all still there, right, Dan?

194
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,486
Most of it.

195
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,059
What do you mean "most of it"?

196
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,641
- How much did you lose?
- Two large.

197
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,671
Come on, we gotta get it by
morning. It'll be all right.

198
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,542
We gotta get it by morning, it's
gonna be all right? Are you crazy?

199
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,707
Skimmin' from Nicky D.,
you're gonna get us both killed!

200
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,717
Don't you ever do that again!
You understand me?

201
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,454
Okay, relax. You think I don't got
a thing lined up here?

202
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,719
You got a thing lined up here?

203
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,921
You think I'm gonna let you down
and leave you hangin'? I got a thing.

204
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,801
Come on. Let's go see a man about
some money.

205
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,963
What's the matter with you?

206
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,300
The guy works nights. He keeps
his cash in the wall.

207
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,412
Jesus, could you make more noise?

208
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,144
Come on, baby, where's my money?

209
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,345
- You wanna give me a hand over?
- For what?

210
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,383
I'm tellin' you, the money,
it's in the wall.

211
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,193
No, watch out!

212
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,259
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go, yeah.

213
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,134
Okay, let's get outta here.
Let's get outta here.

214
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,543
What's that? What are we
talkin' about here?

215
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,745
See that?

216
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,183
Come here.

217
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,214
See that? Look what
I'm talkin' about here?

218
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,020
Was that easy or what?
A bing bang, boom!

219
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,296
Let's get outta here.

220
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,463
What are you...

221
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,236
Is he dead?

222
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,505
What'd you do that for?
Let's get out of here.

223
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,620
All right, this is it.

224
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,050
Now, there's a hundred wanna be
humps in this neighborhood.

225
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,321
They want to roll with
Delarusso's crew.

226
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,294
But it's real simple. You gotta be
a good earner.

227
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,799
You know what I'm sayin'? You gotta
make a lot of money for that man.

228
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,530
When you're not makin', you gotta
be thinkin' about ways to make money.

229
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,173
Now roll over. Roll over.

230
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,446
I'll put a bullet in you.

231
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,447
I'll blow your brains...

232
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,848
That dog reminds me
of my old girlfriend.

233
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,387
Yeah, except the dog
is better lookin'.

234
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,792
Yeah, like your sister.

235
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,026
Where you been, Danny?

236
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,265
Georgie expected you yesterday.

237
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,927
And he's all upset, and now
you know he's got that heart thing.

238
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,166
Yeah, I was just gettin' ready
to drop it off.

239
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,102
- It's all here?
- Yeah, forget about it.

240
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,477
We would have had it here earlier,
but, we did a thing last night.

241
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,614
You mean it was you guys at
that Hawthorne Avenue thing?

242
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,045
Yeah, we went in and out.
We were gonna give you your cut.

243
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,687
Wait right here.

244
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,637
Would you stop starin' at him?
He doesn't like it.

245
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,464
- I'm Danny Keaton. And this is my...
- Sit your ass down, Mick.

246
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,569
That thing on Hawthrone Avenue?
That was a police captain's house.

247
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,208
He's with us.

248
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,611
He gets his ham and cheese sandwich
every week.

249
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,821
And all this
poor bastard knows...

250
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,325
is everything he had is gone,
including his dead father's watch.

251
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,991
And he's got twenty stitches
in the side of his head.

252
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:40,332
That is not "in and out". You guys
gave a beatin' to a police captain.

253
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,208
Put your hands on the table.

254
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:55,480
There's a Sicilian custom.
It goes back hundreds of years.

255
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,181
Punishment for thieves.
Do you know what it is?

256
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,552
They chopped off their hands.

257
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,592
Here. Here it is.

258
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,799
Yeah?
Now where are the fazools?

259
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,131
Lou, count that.

260
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,007
Fourteen hundred.

261
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,711
The Captain said it was
more like 34 hundred.

262
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,381
You jerk-offs blew two dimes
in twelve hours?

263
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,618
Is that what you call layin' low?

264
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:41,625
The streets aren't safe with you
two master criminals walkin' around.

265
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,835
You're different from the Mick.
You go to school?

266
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,172
Yeah, Frankie, he wants
to be a doctor.

267
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,969
What are you, a ventriloquist?
He asked him.

268
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,310
Yeah, I tried to go to college,
but it didn't work out.

269
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,050
A doctor, huh?

270
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:04,481
It takes a lot of discipline to be
a doctor. You that kind of man?

271
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,084
Yes, Sir.

272
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,829
That's good. We need more educated
people in this thing of ours.

273
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,763
Cultured people. That's good.

274
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,371
Too bad the two of you are
gonna be in jail.

275
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,533
What?

276
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,210
You gotta answer for the
beatin' up of the cop.

277
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:34,047
You know, Nicky, this Mick has
big balls. He could do that thing.

278
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,756
Then we give the two large back
to the Captain. We're all set.

279
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,029
Okay. All right.

280
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:57,939
That's him. Genaro Sienna.
He's the shop steward.

281
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,246
You do him.

282
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,374
Come on. Do him,
and we get outta here.

283
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,329
What's this kid waitin' for?

284
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,776
That piece of work that you
want done. I can't do it.

285
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,581
Get these two girls outta here.
I don't want to look at 'em.

286
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,212
Do you know Sienna's
my old man, Mr. Delarusso?

287
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,949
Look, about Frankie,
no disrespect...

288
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,857
he's doin' what any one would do.
He's like an old man to me, too.

289
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,556
You did that left field thing before,
and now you do this!

290
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,928
It's not his fault,
Mr. Delarusso.

291
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,898
Give me my father's life.
Me for him.

292
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,732
I'll work for you
the rest of my life. Please.

293
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,004
You're goin' away for
the cop thing.

294
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,713
I have no problem with that.

295
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,612
Your father has a pass.
He's finished on the job.

296
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,709
He sweeps up at the Union Hall.
He cost me a lot of money.

297
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,923
Your life is mine now.
You understand that?

298
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,901
And now for the final matter
on the agenda.

299
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,175
As you all know, this year...

300
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:17,041
there's a full scholarship to medical
school going to Frank Sienna.

301
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,841
Genaro's son.

302
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,350
One of our own is gonna
to Italy be a doctor...

303
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,422
because of your union dues.

304
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,616
Come on up here, Frank.

305
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,350
That's it, Frank.

306
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,100
Congratulations, Frank.

307
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,763
I'm proud of you, Frankie.

308
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,400
I think you got your mother's
intelligence, god rest her soul.

309
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,477
Now, in Italy, it's different
over there.

310
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,705
They do things in a different way.
Like...

311
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,576
- They kiss.
- Example, they kiss on both cheeks.

312
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,206
Yes, even men. Don't forget,
or it's an insult.

313
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,114
Okay, hold on a second.

314
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,982
Micky D. Sends his regards.

315
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,063
Dr. Sienna!

316
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,668
Congratulations, Doc.

317
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,813
Come see your father.

318
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,875
The doctor's here!

319
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,244
Hey, Pop.

320
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,931
To my son, the doctor.
Salute.

321
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:30,598
It's good.

322
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,467
Dago red.

323
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,771
You all right?

324
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,086
That cough sounds terrible.

325
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,245
We're gonna get that checked out.

326
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,923
Tomorrow, first thing you're
comin' to the hospital.

327
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,257
We're gettin' that checked out.
I'm a doctor. You gotta listen.

328
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,230
I got emphysema.

329
00:28:56,167 --> 00:29:01,230
The doctor, they told me
I got it good.

330
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,978
Pop, how long have you known?

331
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,371
Years.

332
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:15,311
I want you to meet this nice...

333
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,549
Anita.

334
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,941
Naples School of Medicine.
Internship, Vasper De Napoli.

335
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,210
Residency in General and
Cardiac Surgery.

336
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,844
Actually, my residency was in
cardio vascular surgery.

337
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,949
It's all there in my letters
of recommendation.

338
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,748
The cardiac department was
shorthanded...

339
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,251
- so I was helping out a lot.
- Helping out?

340
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,754
Ventricle and arterial scepter
repairs mostly.

341
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,056
Congenital heart defects.

342
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,031
I did more B.S.D. Repairs in one year
than any other doctor on staff.

343
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,865
This is America, not Naples.

344
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,700
The position is in
General Surgery.

345
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,868
You may be needed to assist in
cardio vascular surgeries.

346
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,710
Take it or leave it.

347
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,109
Excuse me?

348
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,950
The position is yours
if you want it.

349
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,587
Yes, of course.

350
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,592
- I just have a few questions.
- You start tomorrow.

351
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,333
What do you want?

352
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,070
You look better than when
you went in.

353
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,679
- I'll take you now.
- Hombre...

354
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,884
What is this thing?
It's a toy car?

355
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,854
No, this is an
Alfa Romeo Spider Volace.

356
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,693
A what? It looks like
a matchbox.

357
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,492
Here, I'll drive it.

358
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,204
So, they treated you well
inside, huh?

359
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,202
Yeah. Mafia manner.

360
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,303
Actually, they leave us alone
in there, you know?

361
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,276
I ran a good business.

362
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:29,144
Booze, drugs, broads.
Forget about it.

363
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,182
The old waps, they got together,
they cooked.

364
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,156
I swear to god, we ate like kings.
Unbelievable. I put on some pounds.

365
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,862
You did some clammin'
in there, huh?

366
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,295
While you were, runnin' around
chasin' nurses...

367
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,568
I was gettin' an education, too.

368
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,966
You know, you shouldn't have had
to take the fall for that.

369
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,837
No, hey, it was time well-spent.

370
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,016
Don't worry about that.

371
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,480
You know what? You don't
look like a doctor.

372
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,648
You still look like that punk kid
who used to chase me around.

373
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,521
I chased you around? You
idolized me, you Mick prick!

374
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,981
How you doin', Dr. Sienna?

375
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,885
- Good, Lou. How about yourself?
- So far so good.

376
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:43,785
- I heard good things about you.
- You've been hearin' right.

377
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,995
It's like déjá vu all over again.
How many times do I gotta tell you?

378
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,100
Ang, I'm runnin' the Union.

379
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,360
Everything's fine.

380
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:54,866
Wait here.

381
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,505
You prick.

382
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,166
You are who you are because
we put you there!

383
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,244
<i>You know that you don't take bread</i>
<i>out of your brother's mouth, right?</i>

384
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,710
<i>I'm not a thief, Mr. D.</i>
<i>On my children, never.</i>

385
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,145
<i>The meeting is over.</i>

386
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,253
<i>You're gonna sort this thing out,</i>
<i>right, Maury?</i>

387
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,091
<i>Yeah, Mr. D.</i>

388
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,328
Frankie!

389
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,431
Welcome back.

390
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:27,929
Listen, I was wonderin' if I could
come up and see you at your office.

391
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,102
I got this heartburn.
It's constant.

392
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,240
- Of course.
- Thanks, Frankie.

393
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:39,243
- We're all really proud of you.
- Thank you, Mr. Maury.

394
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:52,387
Hey! Look who it is! The doctor!

395
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,297
- Hey! You look good.
- Thank you.

396
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,730
- How was Italy?
- Wonderful.

397
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,902
I hope you don't think who you are
just 'cause you're a big-time doctor.

398
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,065
Come on, Nicky.

399
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,015
St. Charles is a very good hospital.
You didn't think I knew, huh?

400
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,348
When one of ours makes it,
I know everything.

401
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:26,326
I'm very proud of you.
You did really good.

402
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,021
Thanks, Nicky.

403
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,096
Now listen. You trust
this kid, Danny?

404
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:38,242
Yeah, he's been like a
brother to me.

405
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,639
I don't like him.

406
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,608
I don't know,
maybe cause he's Irish.

407
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:48,618
I don't know. He's a good earner.
He's gonna be on Angelo's crew.

408
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,989
So anything that you need from me,
you let Danny know.

409
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,093
He'll get right back to me, okay?
Anything at all. You understand?

410
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:01,131
Now, there's something that
I want to ask you to do.

411
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,435
Yeah, anything, Nicky.
I haven't forgotten.

412
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,667
You're gonna be busy. You're gonna
have this big job at the hospital.

413
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:18,373
I'm hopin' that you're gonna find
the time to be my family doctor.

414
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:24,845
- Take care of me and Rose.
- Of course, Nicky. I'm your doctor.

415
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,252
I don't trust the other guys,
you know?

416
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,630
I want you to meet somebody.
Dr. Frank Sienna.

417
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,033
He's from St. Charles Hospital.
The best.

418
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:48,845
He's been after me to go to
a doctor, and now he brings one.

419
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,380
It's nice to meet you.

420
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,879
You're a nice boy,
but I don't like doctors.

421
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,577
She's tired all the time.
This is the truth.

422
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,121
It's a sin to get old?

423
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,817
I want one of those
Sicilian remedies.

424
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,485
That's what I need.

425
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,764
You know, they always worked
in the old days.

426
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,356
They are completely useless.
They stink up the whole house.

427
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,303
Why don't you just let this kid
check you out? That's all.

428
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,234
Why don't you come in, we'll run
a few tests, just to make sure.

429
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,776
- I don't go to hospitals.
- Why don't you go to hospitals?

430
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,844
That's where people go
to die.

431
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,950
I'll explain everything
before-hand.

432
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,348
We don't have to do anything
that makes you uncomfortable.

433
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,616
Please?

434
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,258
Please, Roie?

435
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:43,733
I'll go get the tests. If that's
what my Nicky wants.

436
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:08,521
Make sure you don't get 20 shots
of the back of my head like you did.

437
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,498
Well, looks like we got
a new player.

438
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,645
Janie, give me a dog, will ya?

439
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,619
Sure.

440
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,768
What are you doin'?

441
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,943
He's really a lunatic, this guy.

442
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,549
You could get yourself killed
that way, Detective.

443
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,557
Hey, boys, how's it goin'?

444
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,660
What do you say we go into your
club for a couple of espressos?

445
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,187
What? I'm Sicilian, too.
You didn't know that, huh?

446
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,800
You gotta be a member.

447
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,625
What?

448
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,265
Of what, the Mafia?

449
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,634
I think you're lucky to be alive,
DeSante.

450
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,573
Well, don't think, Angelo.
You're just gonna hurt yourself.

451
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,040
What are you embarassin' yourself
for? Just live and let live.

452
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,778
Live and let live?

453
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,853
I grew up in this neighborhood,
right down that street over there.

454
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,716
We're all pizane.

455
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:52,127
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I forget that sometimes, you know.

456
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,127
Give me hug, Don Nicky, huh?

457
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,857
What is with the guys
that hug and kiss you.

458
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,263
You get a little pissed off?

459
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,865
What are you gonna do,
kiss me now?

460
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,836
- You need a hobby.
- I'm lookin' at it.

461
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,171
Everything you say and do,
I'm there.

462
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,239
My whole life is dedicated
to watching you die in prison.

463
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,853
We'll see who dies.

464
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,755
See, pizans.

465
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,580
No, this is my case.
You're assisting.

466
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,240
When we first met, I thought
you were just another, Wise Guy.

467
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,778
Me? No, I'm Irish.

468
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,609
If me sainted mother were alive,
she'd be thankin' St. Patrick...

469
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,717
that her Danny boy met
Lorina Ryan.

470
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,882
The most beautiful girl
in Jersey.

471
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,112
Go on with ya now.

472
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,388
- Hey, Frank.
- Sorry I'm late.

473
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,425
Sit down. I'd like to introduce
you to my girl.

474
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,630
Frank Sienna.

475
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,932
Lorina Ryan.

476
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,930
- Pleasure.
- You two know each other?

477
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,400
Maybe from the neighborhood.

478
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,306
Come here, you son of a bitch.
When'd you get out? Come on here.

479
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,435
Do me a favor. Look after
my girlfriend, all right, Frankie?

480
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,603
Sure.

481
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:58,845
- Danny, has a lot of friends.
- He's the life of the party.

482
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,517
You, uh, work on
Wall Street with him?

483
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:08,461
Wall Street? No, actually Danny and
I grew up in the same neighborhood.

484
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,763
So, did you make it
through college?

485
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,304
Yeah. I'm a teacher.
Second grade.

486
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,239
I always figured you'd make it.

487
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,250
Well, at least I know you
kept your word.

488
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,687
You promised, never to come back
to the club again, and you didn't.

489
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,253
You never bothered to pick up
the phone and call me, either.

490
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,695
- I was away.
- Away? For eight years.

491
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,465
I know a little about the justice
system. Eight years means a felony.

492
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,569
So, what'd you do? You kill
somebody? Rob somebody?

493
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,608
You know when your Irish is up,
your eyes change color?

494
00:41:55,479 --> 00:42:00,382
I don't want to know where you've
been. It's your business.

495
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,483
You make it sound like
I'm asking you out.

496
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:10,552
Aren't you?

497
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,494
- Hi. How are we? How we doin'?
- Good.

498
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:21,532
Where are the menus? Tommy!
Can we get some menus over here?

499
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,601
You want some champagne?

500
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,707
Oh, I gotta go.

501
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,277
What is that?
What are you talkin' about?

502
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,912
- I gotta go. I'II...
- You just got here.

503
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,708
I know. I'll call you tomorrow.

504
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,646
It was nice to meet you,
Ms. Ryan.

505
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,849
See ya, Dan.

506
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,317
He's a doctor. You know, this thing,
it happens all the time.

507
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,194
Heard you had that baby
with the tetralogy.

508
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,566
Could get very complicated.

509
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,362
You're taking a risk
with a newborn.

510
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,233
That baby was only a heartbeat
away from full arrest.

511
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,135
Worst odds I've ever seen.

512
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:01,209
Odds? That's right, you're
a gamblin' man, aren't you.

513
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,813
On occasion.

514
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,710
I'd have to say 10 to 1 that baby
never gets off the table.

515
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:13,252
Well, that baby is in good hands.

516
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,062
What is Sienna doing in there?
He's not qualified, Phil.

517
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,563
His talents are wasted in
General Surgery, Lyle.

518
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,463
Look, what is it? What is it
you've got against him, huh?

519
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:29,601
- He's an embarrassment.
- Watch him, Lyle.

520
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,167
He's a natural.
He's the best I've seen.

521
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,937
You're putting that baby and
this hospital at risk.

522
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,181
Mr. And Mrs. Hennessey?

523
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,453
The baby's gonna be fine.

524
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,456
Thank you. Thank you so much.

525
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,155
- He's a real fighter.
- Now let me take you to I.C.U.

526
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,290
- Come on, this way. Frank.
- Thank you.

527
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,967
- Frank.
- Thank you.

528
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,378
- What are you doin' here?
- I came with Danny.

529
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,678
He wanted to take his
best friend out to dinner.

530
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,013
- Where is he?
- He stepped out.

531
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,386
I saw the nurses.

532
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,390
How you've been
savin' babies again.

533
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,625
Eight years of medical school's
gotta be worth somethin', huh?

534
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,093
Oh, yeah?

535
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,427
So, I got this problem,
Dr. Sienna.

536
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,530
Okay.

537
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,837
It's my heart.

538
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,603
Give me your hand.

539
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,045
Give me your hand.

540
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,353
You feel that?

541
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,258
Every time I see you,
it beats so fast.

542
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,883
I feel like it's gonna burst.

543
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,892
It's a strong heart. You're gonna
live a long, happy life...

544
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:07,504
- get married, have babies.
- You think so?

545
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,510
Frankie. Every nurse in this joint
is talkin' about you.

546
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,613
Why don't you get one of them?
Go get a bite to eat.

547
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,117
- No, you guys go ahead.
- No, come with us.

548
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,959
Yeah. Come on, you gotta eat.

549
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,663
Yeah, all right.

550
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,200
The guy doesn't know
where he is.

551
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,533
I'm supposed to come pick him up.
He can't tell me the address.

552
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,074
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, of course.

553
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,210
Hey, Frankie, why don't you
do me a favor.

554
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,715
Why don't you take her out
dancin' tonight?

555
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,517
You want me to take
your girl out dancing?

556
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,651
You know, we had some
good times, but I've been tryin'...

557
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,696
to break it to her that I don't
really feel that way about her.

558
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:11,932
You know, actually, I've been
seein' this other. A knockout.

559
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,134
It's better...
I just sit this one out.

560
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,174
- What do you want me to tell her?
- You know, I don't know.

561
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,810
You tell her I got called away,
or a business trip.

562
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:28,907
You're a smart guy.
You think of somethin'.

563
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,224
You're my best friend, right?

564
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,497
Of course.

565
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,893
- Frankie?
- Yes?

566
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,024
But I love it when...

567
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,994
No, we're gonna be late, okay?
Go. No, I...

568
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,132
That's nice.

569
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,304
Now you're startin'
to convince me.

570
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,977
What?

571
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,847
Will you marry me?

572
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,214
Marry you?

573
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:15,350
What are you
talking about?

574
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,153
Lorina Ryan,
will you marry me?

575
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,328
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

576
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,704
I love you.

577
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:06,007
What's this, corpus delicti.
What is that?

578
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,111
- It means corpse.
- Why can't ya say that?

579
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,516
This is nice. You hit
the big time here, Doc.

580
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,882
Yeah, so... where ya been?

581
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:22,885
Business.

582
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,318
Business is boomin' in
the big city.

583
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,061
How's your new wife?
You treatin' her right?

584
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:37,297
- Yeah.
- A doctor. Quite a catch.

585
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,675
What are you doin' here, Dan?

586
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,610
Nicky needs a favor.

587
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,875
All right.

588
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,280
You're treatin' Paul Maury
for that heart thing, right?

589
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,920
Yeah. I'm doin' a double bypass
on him this afternoon.

590
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,353
You tell Nicky not to worry.

591
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:02,157
I've done a lot of these. Paul's
gonna have a new lease on life.

592
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,559
Nicky wants to cancel that lease.

593
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,667
He doesn't want him to
get up off your table.

594
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:12,704
Oh no, Dan, I don't want
any part of this.

595
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,275
- You are a part of this.
- I'm Nicky's doctor, and that's it.

596
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,779
Look, this ain't a multiple
choice thing.

597
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,883
There's only one right
answer here.

598
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:26,081
The guy is Nicola.
He only asks once.

599
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,227
So that's it.
Say hello to Lorina for me.

600
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,521
Hey. I'm so glad it's you, Frank.

601
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,387
You're gonna do right by me,
aren't ya?

602
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,589
He's in trouble.

603
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,795
Doctor?

604
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,975
Frank?

605
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:08,688
What can we do?
Can we do something?

606
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,659
Get epinephrine.

607
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,537
Paddles!

608
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,847
Okay. Give me two fifty.
Stand clear.

609
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,607
Shoot!

610
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,514
Again. Shoot!

611
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,956
Give me three hundred. Shoot!

612
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,305
Folks, looks like
we're back in business.

613
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,522
Let's go for a ride, Frankie.

614
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,676
Where we goin'?

615
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,378
You'll find out when
we get there.

616
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,721
- I want to know now.
- You screwed up, Frank, okay?

617
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,391
- What the hell is that?
- Unbelievable.

618
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,101
He checked out.
A little transfer.

619
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,179
Frankie. Help me.

620
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,349
He's still alive!
We've gotta get him out.

621
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,041
Hey, hey, no, no, leave him.

622
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,342
Leave him.

623
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,147
We gotta get him to a hospital!

624
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,715
Frankie, I said leave him.

625
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,787
You do this to me?

626
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,166
What the hell is wrong with you?

627
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,841
What? You think you're
better than me?

628
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,834
We both work for
the same guy, pal! Wake up!

629
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,781
We don't get this done, that's us
lyin' in there! All right?

630
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,728
Here.

631
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:03,960
Here, throw these out the window.

632
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,458
One every few miles.

633
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,071
It's the teeth.

634
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,540
You know, no corpus delicti,
no crime.

635
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,216
Hey, come on, relax.
You do this for a livin'.

636
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,451
You're not squeamish?

637
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:40,669
Lou. I'm here to see Mrs. D.

638
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,304
Wait here.

639
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:57,219
Mrs. D? It's Dr. Sienna.

640
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,821
Hi, Rose.

641
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:21,566
So... I got the tests back.

642
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:27,942
You have cancer in your ovaries.
We're gonna have to remove them.

643
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:39,920
Well, I've had all my babies.
I don't need them.

644
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,328
The cancer may have spread.

645
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,002
I'm sorry.

646
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,977
How am I going to tell my Nicky?

647
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,910
I can tell him if you like.

648
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,685
I want you to do this thing.

649
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,190
And I want to...
I'll see you later.

650
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,089
I think I wasted a lot of money
on you.

651
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,467
You got a lot of education,
but you're not very smart.

652
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,730
- Listen, Nicky, we need to talk.
- There's no talking!

653
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,567
You disappointed me.

654
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,975
And it's a good thing that Mick
cleaned up your mess with Maury.

655
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,607
Nicky, he came to see Mrs. D.

656
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,076
All right.

657
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,915
You do what you can do
to save my Rose...

658
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,552
I'll forget about the Maury thing.

659
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,088
You remember this?

660
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,320
Remember the kids wouldn't go
to sleep until we sang that song.

661
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,727
- But I forgot the words.
- You're gonna make me cry.

662
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,199
Frankie.

663
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,897
Hey. Everything went fine, Rose.

664
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:07,167
- We'll see.
- You got the best. We got Frankie.

665
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,769
I want you to get some rest now,
okay?

666
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:12,705
It's okay.

667
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,580
Okay. All right, honey?
Whatever you need.

668
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,987
So, we took out the tumor, but...

669
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,956
I'm not gonna lie, Nicky.
The cancer may have spread.

670
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,498
You know the only thing I regret?

671
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:46,340
Is when Rosie found out about me,
and the life, you know?

672
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,747
And it changed something
in her...

673
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,954
I feel really bad about...
about that.

674
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,220
I mean,
maybe it was my fault.

675
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,221
So the next thing,
we take some more tests...

676
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,028
we see the results...

677
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,983
Oh, my god!

678
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:29,457
Not bad for a couple kids from
the neighborhood, huh?

679
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,718
Not bad at all.

680
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,994
- We can do this?
- Absolutely.

681
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:41,731
How?

682
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,432
Will you let me worry about that?

683
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:48,208
Come on, it's strange, you haven't
been at the hospital that long...

684
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,505
So what? Will you stop?

685
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,575
- What?
- Where you been gettin' money?

686
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,850
I didn't tell ya?
I'm a doctor.

687
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,115
What?
What are you worried about?

688
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,290
Are you taking money
from Nicola Delarusso?

689
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:11,724
What? No, I'm not takin' money
from Nicola Delarusso.

690
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,695
What, is that what this is about?

691
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:18,563
Come on, Lorina, it's ridiculous.

692
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,704
You promise?

693
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,875
I promise.

694
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,348
- Mr. DeSante.
- Yeah.

695
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:30,951
I'm Dr. Sienna.

696
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,988
- Nice to meet ya.
- Nice to meet you.

697
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,283
It says that you suffer from periodic
chest pain, shortness of breath?

698
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:41,052
Yeah. But what's with these silly
gowns with your asses hangin' out?

699
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,956
Is this to make you guys feel like
you're in control, or what?

700
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,595
No, the truth is,
I'm an ass man.

701
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:50,331
- Would you take that down, please?
- Yes, I will.

702
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,969
- Whoa. Close call.
- Yeah. A little too damn close.

703
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,973
Take a deep breath, please.

704
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,817
War wound?

705
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:05,182
- Yeah, sort of
. - Again.

706
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,723
- Military?
- Mob.

707
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,326
They usually have rules
against shootin' cops...

708
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:17,557
I busted some soldier on a truck
jacking who forgot about the rules...

709
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,265
Thought he could shoot
his way out of trouble.

710
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:23,333
You know. I guess I forgot
to put down there...

711
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,941
I'm a detective with the
Organized Crime Unit.

712
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,938
Sounds like an interesting
line of work.

713
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,944
Oh yeah. Be happy to show you
some of my work.

714
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,828
You take a good picture.

715
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,159
A respectable doctor like yourself
should get some new friends.

716
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,163
Not people who kill people
for a living.

717
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,000
These are very good pictures.

718
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,671
I think you have a future
in photography.

719
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,215
This top Union official,
Paul Maury...

720
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,841
the word on the street is that he's
fallen out of grace with Nicky D.

721
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,647
You operated on
this guy?

722
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:14,988
That's right.

723
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,354
Out of all the surgeons in the city,
he comes to you?

724
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,725
He helped me get a scholarship to
medical school through the Union.

725
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,491
My father was a member for years.
I was just returning a favor.

726
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,803
That's a favor and a half.
This guy's disappeared now.

727
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,474
I know that Mr. Maury was being
transferred to another hospital.

728
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,101
The problem is,
he never showed up.

729
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,674
Mr. DeSante, we're not responsible
for what happens to patients...

730
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:40,646
after they leave
the hospital.

731
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,885
You think being a doctor hides
who you really are?

732
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,054
Your blood pressure's
way too high.

733
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,716
So, what do you do for
the old man, anyway?

734
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,727
You sign a bunch of phony
death certificates...

735
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,853
patch up some soldiers
with lead in their ass?

736
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,194
I'm Mr. Delarusso's family doctor.

737
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,267
I know. That's what I just said.

738
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,269
His wife, Rose,
is my patient.

739
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,940
That's good, Doc.

740
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:11,036
Look, I can help you get out
of this work.

741
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,876
The FBI, they'll protect you
and your family.

742
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,712
You can start new.
Someplace else.

743
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:21,250
Just talk to us.

744
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,121
I have other patients to see.

745
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:31,529
- I'm a friend of Dr. Sienna's.
- Are you really?

746
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,468
And, are you a doctor, too?

747
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:41,102
- Well, I work on Wall Street.
- Oh, do you really?

748
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,574
You know all those mergers you
hear about, that's me.

749
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,743
I got a little investment thing
I'm workin' on with the doctor.

750
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,976
I gotta drop somethin' off.

751
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,685
I could give you my number...

752
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:02,030
and maybe you could stop by?

753
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,083
Nobody robs from me!

754
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,689
- He wasn't gonna tell me about them.
- The undertaker would have found.

755
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,192
Frankie, you okay?

756
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,592
- Hey, Doc?
- You all right?

757
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,029
You know, I never liked you.

758
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:41,762
But Nicky says you're gonna be
a good investment.

759
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,270
Well, maybe someday
you'll prove it.

760
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,301
Hey, whoa, whoa! It's all right!
It's all right! Lou, come on.

761
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,677
Frankie, go wait in the car.

762
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,941
You know,
he's a cocky bastard.

763
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,645
No, no, he's cool.
He's a little freaked out.

764
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,654
- You just blew a guy's brains out.
- Well, is that right?

765
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,351
Well, the heat is on you
if he goes sideways.

766
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,292
Yeah, I know.

767
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,835
You remember that cop, DeSante?

768
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,566
Yeah. The prick's been after
Nicky for years.

769
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,769
Well... I saw him one time at the
hospital. He was talkin' to Frank.

770
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,942
Well, he better not be talkin'
too much.

771
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,480
He likes bein' a big shot too much.
You don't got to worry about him.

772
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,582
All right, get outta here.

773
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,828
What do we... This doctor,
what do we do about him?

774
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,665
He's crossed the line.

775
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,241
What would you do, Ang?

776
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,405
I don't know.
That's why I'm askin' you.

777
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:03,711
You gotta find out a way that
we can put him in a corner so...

778
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,309
he can't go against us,
you know?

779
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:10,324
Roie, what are doing? You're
supposed to be in bed?

780
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,494
- The doctor told you. Come on.
- I'm gonna die in that bed.

781
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,623
I want to feel like myself again.
I just...

782
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,937
I was tryin' to take care of you,
like you take care of me.

783
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:32,108
You take care of me.
You brought me Frankie.

784
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,339
- And the sauce?
- Garbage.

785
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,367
You like what you see?

786
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,512
My husband just bought
this for me.

787
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,011
It's okay, Bob already
took care of us.

788
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,582
This is a tiny piece of garbage.

789
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:14,584
You give me a big Cadillac.
A nice, big back seat.

790
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:19,387
Nothin' like layin' a woman down on
that fine Cadillac leather.

791
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,160
Get outta of my car.

792
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,459
Your car?
No, you got that wrong.

793
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:30,168
See, this is my car.
I own this car.

794
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,231
Just like I own that
beautiful house you got.

795
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,203
Just like I own that doctor husband
of yours. And just like I own you.

796
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:45,119
Now, don't go playin' dumb with me,
Lorina Ryan.

797
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,983
You know who I am.

798
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,050
Your father did a lot of
work for me.

799
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,526
Those Westies were animals,
and he was the worst.

800
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:07,606
Frankie never told me what a
beautiful set of tits his wife had.

801
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,339
You know, I'm gonna keep a
picture of you in my mind and...

802
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:15,779
the next broad that I screw,
I'll be thinkin' of you.

803
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,223
Now, you tell Frankie
what happened here...

804
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:24,622
he'll probably wanna
bust my head.

805
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,320
Then I'll have to whack him.

806
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,290
But then it'll just be me and you.

807
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,433
Would you like that?
Answer me!

808
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:39,597
- I won't say a word.
- All right.

809
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:45,537
You don't make waves. All right?
Just enjoy this fine car you got.

810
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,245
And be happy...

811
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:52,148
your husband isn't in pieces
in the woods, all right?

812
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,563
Oh, there's Tara.

813
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,870
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, honey.

814
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,011
Where's Phil?
You want something to drink?

815
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,810
Two glasses of champagne,
please?

816
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,212
Right away!

817
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,749
You're nothing but
a no talent guinea.

818
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,886
Did you just call me
a guinea?

819
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,890
No, no, I didn't.

820
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,820
I hope you're not on call tonight,
Doctor.

821
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,986
Of course I'm on call.

822
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,393
They need one surgeon who'll get
the job done.

823
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,724
You're drunk.

824
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,826
You think you're so good.
You just got lucky.

825
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,338
The reason I hired you is 'cause
I lost a $100 thousand dollars...

826
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:47,840
gambling with your
guinea wap friends.

827
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,738
"Hire Frank Sienna.

828
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:53,144
Do this thing for us,
your slate is wiped clean."

829
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:02,752
<i>Did you see that dress she was</i>
<i>wearing? Dr. Sienna's wife.</i>

830
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,517
<i>Oh, poor thing.</i>
<i>She's trying so hard.</i>

831
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:11,565
<i>Listen, I heard a wild rumor.</i>
<i>Dr. Sienna's a mob guy.</i>

832
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,032
<i>Oh, my Henry thinks so.</i>

833
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,763
<i>He says Lyle was forced</i>
<i>to hire him.</i>

834
01:11:16,972 --> 01:11:18,872
Can you imagine?

835
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:26,004
Was the chicken rubbery enough
for you tonight?

836
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,676
Well, what do you expect
for 250 dollars a seat, huh?

837
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,982
But remember, this is all
for the kids tonight.

838
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,190
So, moving on to the awards.

839
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,053
The first one goes to
the doctor...

840
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,527
who has gone above and
beyond the call of duty...

841
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,495
who's shown outstanding service
to the community.

842
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,601
Dr. Frank Sienna,
come on up.

843
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,457
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

844
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,494
What, are you crazy? Stop.

845
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,598
I won't be married to a man
who lies to me.

846
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,198
What are you talking about?

847
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,159
Do you think I'm stupid, Frank?

848
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,201
Do you think doin' charity work
and gettin' awards...

849
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,365
makes up for all the blood money
you take?

850
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,067
All right, look, Lorina, let's
talk about this, okay? Please?

851
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,543
- I want the truth, Frank.
- The truth?

852
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,417
The truth is, the less you know
the better.

853
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:41,088
- Goodbye, Frank.
- Stop! Are you just gonna walk out?

854
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:45,387
You have been lying to me
from the very beginning, Frank!

855
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,424
- I'm trying to protect you!
- Protect me?

856
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,962
Yes!

857
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,128
You think I'm safe?

858
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:56,705
You have no idea.

859
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:03,642
For god's sakes, your old man was
one of them! You didn't know?

860
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,378
Lorina, stop.

861
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,484
You want to know what's
really pathetic?

862
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:15,612
I didn't want to know,
'cause I loved you.

863
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,462
What does that mean?
Lorina, what does that mean?

864
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,665
Are you telling me you
don't love me anymore?

865
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,030
Look at me in the eye and
tell me you don't love me anymore!

866
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,629
- Lorina, don't go.
- I can't.

867
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,674
- Don't go!
- Stop it!

868
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:43,280
Frankie. Let's... leave with me.
We'll get out, you know?

869
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,846
- Get out where?
- I don't know.

870
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,821
- What does that mean?
- I don't know! We just leave!

871
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,119
You think I haven't thought
about that a million times?

872
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,860
Where we gonna go?

873
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,931
What are you gonna do? You don't
think they're gonna follow us?

874
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,193
They're not gonna stop
until we're dead.

875
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:05,502
I don't know, Frank.

876
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,969
I'm gonna make this up to you,
I promise.

877
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,239
Okay. Okay.

878
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,387
Frank?

879
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,100
Genaro? It's Frankie.

880
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,809
Frankie's here.

881
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,409
Frankie...

882
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,624
I'm here, Pop.

883
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:01,622
How is your beautiful wife?

884
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,626
Good.

885
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:12,036
Take good care of her.

886
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,944
Hey, Pop?

887
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:23,875
You know, I never got a chance
to tell you that I'm proud of you.

888
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:30,146
All those years, workin' hard
for the family...

889
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:32,386
and you never complained.

890
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:42,133
I hope... you stay out.

891
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:51,376
Promise... you'II...

892
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,104
Get out...

893
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,609
Promise?

894
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:02,585
I promise, Pop.

895
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,227
Pop?

896
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,132
Pop.

897
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:42,356
Here we go.

898
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,135
One quarter! You see that?

899
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,372
Oh, man.

900
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,366
You remember these times?

901
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,102
I miss this, you know?

902
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:00,146
The two of us gettin' together
and havin' a pitcher.

903
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,715
We gotta do this more often.

904
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,681
Yeah, I'm gettin' out.

905
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,246
What?

906
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,351
I'm gettin' out.

907
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,616
Hey, wait, wait.

908
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:16,329
Hey. Hey, come here.
What are you talkin' about?

909
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:19,859
You just don't wake up one morning
and say you want out, huh?

910
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,833
You want to get us both whacked?

911
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,330
Danny, I'm gettin' out.
I'm done.

912
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,907
Oh yeah, what are you gonna do?
You pack a little suitcase?

913
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,669
Like get on a bus? What are you
talkin' about, you're out?

914
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:33,470
As far as they're concerned, I'm
lookin' out for you. It's my ass.

915
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,708
I'm talkin' about I'm done
with Nicky D.

916
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,375
I'm done with Angelo.
I'm done with Lou. I'm done...

917
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,647
Shh-shh, you just keep
your mouth shut.

918
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,790
What are you talkin' about?

919
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,623
I'm goin' to DeSante.

920
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,061
And then what?

921
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,266
The guys aren't gonna stop.

922
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:59,134
Forget about me and you.
Think about Lorina. And Nonie.

923
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,005
I am thinkin' about Lorina and
Nonie. They're gonna be protected.

924
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,269
By who? FBI?

925
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:06,370
FBI tell you they're gonna
protect them?

926
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,446
FBI's gonna protect them?

927
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,915
Yeah, they could put you
in a freakin' cave in Utah...

928
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,112
- these guys are gonna find you.
- What do you want me to do?

929
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,314
What do you want me to do?
I told my old man.

930
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:20,495
Your old man's dead.
I'm sorry.

931
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,629
And promises are meant
to be broken.

932
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,337
- Look, okay...
- You know, Danny...

933
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:34,038
Come on, come on.
Look, I'm gonna help ya.

934
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:37,737
We're brothers, right?

935
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,471
But you gotta be smart about this.

936
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,816
It's gonna take a little time.
You gotta trust me, okay?

937
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,196
All right... Back it up.

938
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,951
Where's your husband?

939
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:29,154
He's on his way home.
He'll be here any minute.

940
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,965
I can wait.

941
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,795
Well, I'm in the middle
of cookin' dinner, so...

942
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:44,574
Dr. Sienna, please.
It's his wife.

943
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:49,043
Okay, yes. Tell him to call home,
it's urgent.

944
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,844
Thanks.

945
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,919
I told you what would happen.

946
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,121
Go ahead.

947
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:11,764
- I tried to call you, but...
- What's the matter?

948
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,201
What?

949
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,415
Hey, Doc.
How's the heart business?

950
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:24,147
Lorina, would you excuse us
a second?

951
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,385
Get the hell out of my house,
Angelo.

952
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,298
Let's go, Frankie.

953
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:01,982
I couldn't let him touch me
anymore!

954
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,643
I'm here to see Mrs. D.

955
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,166
If you're here,
that means Angie is dead.

956
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:56,494
I want out.

957
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,269
You want out?

958
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,838
You're dead.
That's how you're out.

959
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,045
Then I'm takin' you with me.

960
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,149
I trusted you.
I treated you like a son.

961
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,852
- We had a deal.
- What deal? Let my father die?

962
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,752
You turned against me.
You turned against the family.

963
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,257
- I made you a doctor!
- Yes, you made me a doctor, Nicky!

964
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,225
But at what price?
So I can wake up...

965
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,855
and find Angelo with a gun
in my wife's head?

966
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,833
What do you think, you're the first
punk who ever put a gun in my face?

967
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,766
Is that what you think?

968
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:33,264
Come on!

969
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,638
The difference between me and you
is I'm not afraid to die!

970
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,906
Frankie?

971
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,085
I thought I heard you.

972
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:50,653
What? You hungry?

973
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:53,454
Rose, what are you doing?
You should be in bed.

974
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:57,156
Come on, we have something.
Ravioli. Give him some ravioli.

975
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,823
I can't stay. I've got to go
to the hospital.

976
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,604
I'll walk you out.

977
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,637
Lou?

978
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:20,879
Oh, Frankie!

979
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:27,187
It's okay. It's okay.

980
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,286
- It's okay. It's okay.
- All right.

981
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:33,361
- Frank?
- What?

982
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:37,169
- Did you kill him?
- Oh god, I should have.

983
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,345
Come on. Okay.

984
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,538
Get back!

985
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,840
It's okay. It's okay.

986
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,516
Al right, let's go. Let's go.

987
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,453
Let's get the bags.
Let's go.

988
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,227
Let's go!

989
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:19,046
<i>Frankie. They shot me.</i>

990
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:22,240
<i>I'm bleedin' and</i>
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

991
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:25,410
- You gave me up to Angelo.
<i>- No, I didn't. I...</i>

992
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,511
<i>I stood up for you and</i>
<i>they came after me!</i>

993
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:30,816
<i>Come on, man,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

994
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,159
Where are you?

995
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,989
<i>The place.</i>

996
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:40,394
Okay. Hold on, I'll be there.

997
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,370
- Look, keep them safe.
- What you doin'? Where you goin'?

998
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:49,443
- I gotta take care of somethin'.
- What are you talkin' about?

999
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,842
- You're our star witness!
- What do you think I'm gonna do?

1000
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,243
You have my family.

1001
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,008
Frank, what do you think we're
gonna do, let you run around loose?

1002
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:57,812
- We gotta take care of you.
- Okay, let go, or the deal's off!

1003
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:00,221
You're gonna run around and
take care of somethin' now?

1004
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:20,337
If you hurt that boy...

1005
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,237
I will not forgive you.

1006
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,031
Danny?

1007
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,505
I knew you'd come and
do the right thing.

1008
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,842
You always were the better man.

1009
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,378
They sent you.

1010
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:11,791
Ang always said you didn't have
the balls for the street.

1011
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,057
Danny?

1012
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,829
- Listen to me.
- You killed Ang.

1013
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,866
Now they're gonna open
the books for me.

1014
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:22,798
They're never gonna make you.
Can't you see that?

1015
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,805
To them, you're just another
Irish hump.

1016
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,033
Shut up!

1017
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:33,670
You think this is hard for me?
It's not!

1018
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:36,181
I've been waitin' to do this
all these years!

1019
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:39,876
You know how long I had my nose
pressed up watchin' you?

1020
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:45,355
You got everything.
You got my girl. My life.

1021
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:54,561
Nick said:
"The doctor gets a pass."

1022
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:56,969
A pass?

1023
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:00,632
Don't be stupid.

1024
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,018
Don't do it, Danny.
