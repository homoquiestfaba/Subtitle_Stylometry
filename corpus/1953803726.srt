1
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,521
Come on.

2
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,420
What happened?

3
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:51,324
The mortuary called the hospital.
Said she had made one mistake.

4
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:54,454
They almost were trying to anoint him.

5
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:57,395
They buried my grandfather last spring.
What if he was still alive.

6
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,333
Will, he was 95 years old.
Of course he was dead.

7
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:06,997
If it is not dead, then he does that
After spending five hours with her mother.

8
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,376
They get all of your guts
before you show a box stop.

9
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,810
No one is currently alive
buried.

10
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:14,936
You did it.

11
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,311
I told you, it is on your key,
the lock is in order.

12
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,849
It is a copy, right?
- I do not know.

13
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:21,952
Let's go.

14
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,514
Caution.

15
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:31,051
Okay, I got one.

16
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,287
Does it have anything to do with the terrible
accidents or robbing of corpses?

17
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:38,062
No. But it's true.
- Sure.

18
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:40,664
No, it's true
- I want to hear it.

19
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:41,699
Good.

20
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:45,304
It is early in the morning.
Very early.

21
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:49,238
And a couple comes from a store.

22
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:55,000
It was probably a restaurant,
one of those 24-hour breakfast eateries.

23
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,976
You are bad at telling stories.

24
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,314
It must have been a restaurant,
otherwise it has not been opened.

25
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:04,078
They had stayed up all night and decided
breakfast instead of going home.

26
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,550
You know how that goes.

27
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:09,713
Most importantly, it was very early
and there were very few people.

28
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:12,314
As they walk to their cars, are
they passed a guy.

29
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,188
None of them had ever seen.

30
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,194
But as she passed him, they walk
literally against him.

31
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,991
And that unknown squeezes past them
back and mumbles "sorry".

32
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,362
And before anyone can react, remove
He scissors from under his coat...

33
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,560
and starts them in their face and neck
to stabbing.

34
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,605
What was their friend?
- She was screaming, probably.

35
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:41,009
She watched her friend was stabbed,
without reason.

36
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,713
Anyway, there was a cop,
out of service in the restaurant.

37
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:51,881
Its just on Sat night. He pulls
his gun and shoot down the psycho.

38
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,657
And that's the real story?

39
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,318
There are these crazy people out here.

40
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:03,022
Can you imagine a
restaurant and you will be stabbed?

41
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:07,430
Will we get it in time?
What time do these things closed?

42
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,866
Will it give the blame if we do not
on time.

43
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,096
He was the one that our poor road
pointed.

44
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,436
That's not my fault. No one showed me
told that we do not have coverage.

45
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,064
This was my GPS useless.

46
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:21,611
Why are we here?
There is no labyrinth closer to home?

47
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,909
As this is the biggest grain labyrinth
in the province.

48
00:06:25,014 --> 00:06:27,107
Sometimes it takes hours to get through
to come.

49
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:29,980
I went as a child often used to
a labyrinth.

50
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,212
I do not think we have time hours.

51
00:06:33,122 --> 00:06:36,386
For the same money, kick them out now
all people.

52
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:40,017
We'll just have to wait.
After all it is only seven hours.

53
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,220
We can always do something else.

54
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:46,527
Here, something else? Maybe if you
enjoy looking at cow scare.

55
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,861
I'm not boerrinetje.

56
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,531
No one says you are, Klara.

57
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:57,669
Wait, Trientje?
Wait, or Suurtje?

58
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,971
Those things you are dead.

59
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,242
I mean it.

60
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,915
<i>The Rabbit Hole''''</i>

61
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:35,445
Will.

62
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,676
They're cute.

63
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:39,616
Acorn.

64
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,413
Yes.

65
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,551
I just wanted to help get out.
- Liar.

66
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,783
I did not really scare.

67
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,487
It is closed.

68
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,394
Thank you. We knew that already

69
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,561
What do we do now?

70
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,189
Still a little early, huh?
- Yes, the days are getting shorter.

71
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,291
It is cold here, when the sun is.

72
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:02,267
Thank you. We knew that already

73
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:05,568
Collin.

74
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:07,999
What are you doing?

75
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:10,300
I'm going to see the maze.

76
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,206
Do not be stupid.
That is off limits.

77
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,337
It's a corn maze, we will not
steal or something.

78
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,576
I thought you wanted sleeping cows
scare.

79
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,084
Come on.

80
00:09:34,962 --> 00:09:38,295
Look, this is great.
Look.

81
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,701
Did you hear that?

82
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:48,197
Stop, you're paranoid.
Come on.

83
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,538
If we are arrested, I say that
I was forced.

84
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,004
You know Bonnie shot
he teamed up with Clyde, eh?

85
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:57,977
Bonnie was a jerk.

86
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,674
Never leave a man planning a robbery,
He will always exaggerate.

87
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:06,185
He thinks that if he 'wields a weapon,
and "wearing a mask, he is invincible.

88
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:11,088
You do not know what you're talking about.
Weapons are sexy.

89
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,658
And why did you not have a girlfriend.

90
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,575
That looks scary.

91
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,652
Yack.

92
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,893
Walking around in 'n labyrinth but
for a while fun.

93
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,930
How long are we going to do?

94
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,965
Can I have your necklace look like?

95
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,440
See?

96
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:37,924
You're it.

97
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:50,131
You're it.

98
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:56,268
A

99
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:57,169
Two.

100
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:58,035
Three.

101
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:58,868
Four.

102
00:11:58,974 --> 00:11:59,668
Five.

103
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,198
35.

104
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:34,131
36.

105
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:35,065
37.

106
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,033
38.

107
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:45,741
48.

108
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:46,708
49.

109
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,675
50.

110
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,782
This is pretty fun.

111
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,452
Yes. It sure is.

112
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:02,450
Until Cole and Jordan do not finish
for the evening is over.

113
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,358
Come on, you know that Jordan is not considered.

114
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,292
She would never say something Cole
deliberately hurting.

115
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:11,022
She broke up with him,
that seems pretty intentional.

116
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:12,859
That's not fair.

117
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,126
Okay, you go this way,
and I'm going that way.

118
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:20,635
No. Do not leave me alone.

119
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,632
It's more fun when we split up.

120
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:24,607
Okay then.

121
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,868
Turn that thing off.
You look like a buoy.

122
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:03,803
Collin?

123
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,219
You... are .. him.

124
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:24,093
It suits you.
Give me a few seconds to get away.

125
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:25,528
A.

126
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:26,627
Two.

127
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,061
Three.

128
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:29,599
Four.

129
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,267
Five.

130
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,203
13.

131
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,538
15.

132
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,977
19.

133
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:39,742
25.

134
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,441
29.

135
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:53,145
30.
Who has not vanished...

136
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,250
Who was that?

137
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:36,313
That was not funny.

138
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:38,822
Cole?

139
00:16:42,361 --> 00:16:44,056
That had me fall.

140
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,655
Hello? Will?

141
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,060
Will?

142
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,204
I can not...
I've dropped my glasses. I see nothing.

143
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,340
Collin, is it you?

144
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,571
Sorry.

145
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,977
Collin, if it's you, do you want
first help to find my glasses.

146
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,216
Come on, I can not see.

147
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,423
He must be here somewhere.

148
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:10,152
What are you doing?

149
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:12,662
Stop it.

150
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:23,102
Collin?

151
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,080
Cole?

152
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,085
Dude, just come forth, so
I can type.

153
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,523
Haunt me is not funny.

154
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,838
Hey, you're not...

155
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,738
Who are you?

156
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:22,109
Wait.

157
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,656
We are doing nothing wrong here.

158
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:40,531
Will, I'm glad I found you.
I shall be very afraid of this labyrinth.

159
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,967
Shit.

160
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:47,095
You're it.
I am sure him.

161
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:51,437
Have you seen the way Collin?
He is doing very scary things.

162
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,941
Allison, there is someone else in the maze.

163
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:57,604
What do you mean?
Someone else outside our five?

164
00:19:57,713 --> 00:20:00,180
Yes, I just saw him, he was just here.

165
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,916
I saw him, Will.

166
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,643
What do you mean? You just saw him?
- I just saw him.

167
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:06,720
my glasses fell, I could not see anything and then
someone came to, I'm Collin.

168
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,720
Allison, what happened?

169
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:12,789
He grabbed me and hit his arm
around me.

170
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:15,083
I just thought it was Collin.

171
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,992
Come on, let's go find him
and we will organize this.

172
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:21,121
If anyone here, then I
not find him, Will.

173
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:24,758
Listen, I have the keys. Why do
we will not leave here, to the car?

174
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,994
So you think we are all here
to leave behind?

175
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,503
No, I think it is safer if we
go to the car.

176
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,540
No. It is safer if we all
stay together.

177
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:34,665
Come on.

178
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,409
I'm not him.

179
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,676
I would have tapped.
- Let me see your neck.

180
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,820
What if you do not have stopped somewhere else?
- Is not that cheating.

181
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,049
I do not know the rules that we use.

182
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:59,924
If I had to, I would have long since caught up.
I'm faster than you anyway.

183
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:03,190
But, if I'm not me and we walk
together...

184
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,066
you know you're always safe with me.

185
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:10,227
Yes, but then I walk with you.
That's like have to choose between two bad ones.

186
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,445
I bake anything from this game.

187
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,524
Will, what is it?
- Nothing. I'm just around.

188
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:37,669
Do you think this is real?

189
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:42,230
I do not know.

190
00:22:48,613 --> 00:22:51,137
Will, I really think we should leave here,
and...

191
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:57,544
What are you doing, dickhead?
You people can not be intimidated to walk.

192
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:04,891
Will?

193
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,731
Boy, Allison.

194
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:24,078
Will have to catch her.
- So Will is it?

195
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,052
I had told you that.

196
00:24:27,823 --> 00:24:32,054
What about her? Even if they want,
she can not make noise now.

197
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:38,931
Being afraid is not always a bad trait.
Sometimes it's even more fun.

198
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:44,062
If we are arrested by,
it's a bad habit.

199
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:47,194
She must learn to control themselves.

200
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,483
Will and Allison still play it?
Or are they're not 't have sex?

201
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:10,681
They're probably behind one another,
and are not looking for one of us.

202
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,272
Brian, Sarah.

203
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:20,434
I'll call just because I thought we
would see each other about nine hours...

204
00:26:21,478 --> 00:26:26,574
so I think I call you later.

205
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:31,181
I'm sorry. I have nothing from him
heard.

206
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,854
We could go a few hours ago
and he is never coming days.

207
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:42,657
Yes, definitely.
Let me know if I hear something from him.

208
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,756
Okay. Goodbye.

209
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,606
Police officer you speak with Larson.
- Mark, you speak with Sarah Turner.

210
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:07,806
Hi, Sarah. How are you?
You okay?

211
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:12,146
I think so. I hope so.
I make me a bit worried about Brian.

212
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,013
Brian McKinley?
- Yes.

213
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,248
Yes, we would meet a few hours ago
meet, but he is not showing up.

214
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,353
We can give him as missing
if only a few hours to go.

215
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,359
I know.
I was just wondering if you've seen him.

216
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:26,052
I have not seen him.

217
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,185
Eric has seen him?

218
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:30,265
His service is over.
Have you tried Mim's?

219
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,390
I have already phoned the bar and he is
not been.

220
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,663
That is strange Brian.
When did you last see him?

221
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:42,298
Something for seven hours,
by Sam Hunt's corn maze.

222
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:45,706
You know what?
why do not you call him tomorrow...

223
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,438
If you still can not find him go
we make some calls. Okay?

224
00:27:50,214 --> 00:27:52,807
Yes, that's fine, I guess.

225
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,016
'm Sorry that I respond so.

226
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,713
That's okay. Have a good evening.
Talk to you later.

227
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,288
Okay, good night.

228
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,396
Hello?

229
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,401
Is anyone there?

230
00:28:28,177 --> 00:28:30,371
You bother me when watching TV.

231
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,776
If you come now,
I call the police.

232
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:41,442
If they vote out the blonde,
I'm going to shoot someone.

233
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:53,384
Look...

234
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:58,357
I'm sorry there just.
I'm not there after.

235
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:05,460
It does not matter.

236
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,535
You're the one who knows how I am
with relationships, so...

237
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:15,736
Do not.
I try to make my excuses.

238
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:18,713
Well, it's not so well off.

239
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:21,177
Than not.

240
00:29:21,285 --> 00:29:25,846
Your love life is nothing to me.
For me go old and die alone.

241
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,297
Johnson's weather if you are...

242
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,437
I hang you up,
as the ugly pig scum that you are.

243
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:27,414
This is not a game.

244
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,550
I'm tired...

245
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,650
I'm cold...

246
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,175
and I got a gun.

247
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:37,890
I trust anyone under 30.

248
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,730
We have to leave.

249
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:41,830
You were always smarter than the other
girls.

250
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:49,903
Let's wait a few minutes,
so we know that he is gone.

251
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,244
I hear you.

252
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,778
Do not make me use it.

253
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:46,761
What was that?

254
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:49,566
Was that a gun?

255
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,835
No, I can not.
He would not really shoot one of us.

256
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:59,704
Maybe we should go forward,
We do not want the rest has gone before.

257
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:03,645
Wait.
Allison has the keys?

258
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:10,620
Yes, and if she is so afraid as I think,
do you think they are waiting for us?

259
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:13,255
Exactly.

260
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:45,642
The keys?

261
00:35:48,252 --> 00:35:49,344
The keys.

262
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:11,480
I thought Allison had the torch.

263
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:17,886
Do not touch him.

264
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:19,854
Who did this?

265
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:22,789
I do not know, but we have here
really gone.

266
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,857
How? My necklace.

267
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:31,824
I do not know.
I gave it to Will.

268
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:35,100
Where's Will?
- I do not know.

269
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:37,032
Will has not done so.

270
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,494
We have to leave.

271
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:42,039
Where's Will?
Where's Allison?

272
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:46,768
Where's Colin?
- Everyone needs it shot heard.

273
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:51,844
We must from the labyrinth.
And back to the car.

274
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:52,812
Okay.

275
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,289
Damn.

276
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:31,441
What was that?
- I heard nothing.

277
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,604
I thought I heard someone.

278
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:36,080
Come on, we're almost there.
- No, I heard someone.

279
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,047
Jordan's go.

280
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:09,897
Do you already have coverage?

281
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:14,536
No. And we do not as long as we
In this labyrinth are.

282
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,477
There is just nothing.

283
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:20,610
Okay. Let's try mine.

284
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:27,319
Nothing.

285
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:35,221
Can you see something?
- Of course not, it's corn.

286
00:39:35,328 --> 00:39:38,559
Yes, I know, but it feels like
We get closer.

287
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:42,665
Cole...

288
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,557
That was Will.
- I know.

289
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,726
Will if he has to address,
then he too Allison.

290
00:40:17,828 --> 00:40:20,318
That was her flashlight,
that the old man had.

291
00:40:23,232 --> 00:40:25,831
Where's Colin?
- I do not know.

292
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,392
He's hurt, but that guy is fast.

293
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:35,772
Can you walk?
- I do not know.

294
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,372
This is not the time to experiment,
So...

295
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:50,850
I can distract him...

296
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:55,081
No, do not be stupid.
We do not know what we have been in the labyrinth.

297
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,352
Okay, I'm going.

298
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:09,567
When the coast is clear, try
to get away.

299
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:14,127
Go to the farm and use the phone.

300
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,339
Call the police.

301
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:23,438
Make sure they come here.

302
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:37,281
Cole, wait.

303
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:47,022
I'm sorry.

304
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,438
Still fun?

305
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,714
Where you going?
I'm not done with you.

306
00:45:56,024 --> 00:45:59,186
<i>Off with his head.</i>

307
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:53,058
Jordan, running.

308
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:56,274
Where is the exit?

309
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:01,486
Damn.

310
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:59,399
No.

311
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:16,314
What happened?
- I killed them.

312
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:09,487
Okay, I understand.
We're ready.

313
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,058
Sam's corn maze is burned.

314
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,534
Is anyone hurt?

315
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,804
Until now there was only
a young woman, screaming.

316
00:53:22,905 --> 00:53:25,668
She comes in for questioning after they
the ambulance looked at her.

317
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:27,401
Is she from here?

318
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:30,739
Joel did not recognize her,
it probably comes from the city.

319
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:33,875
What do you think? Lighted or accident?

320
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,245
Who knows. That corn mazes
are like matchboxes.

321
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:40,011
A potential slaughter.

322
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:43,177
And arson is perhaps only
the beginning of the night.

323
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:44,254
What do you mean?

324
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:49,219
The girl came out,
screaming, I killed them.

325
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:55,061
She was covered in blood, the ambulance
said they had cut.

326
00:53:55,763 --> 00:53:57,890
So you mean that murder is involved.

327
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,493
I do not know, but I'll go to
forensic team call.

328
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:04,061
You mean Joey?

329
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:06,502
Yes, he will be excited to meet the
get started.

330
00:54:06,605 --> 00:54:10,540
Well, not me.
Should I call someone else?

331
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:15,176
No, let them sleep.
The province takes the matter anyway.

332
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:16,940
With the competence.

333
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:21,706
And we only know something about a murder,
if they have scoured field.

334
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:27,550
And what about Sam? He is pretty good
upset about his cornfield.

335
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:32,421
Yes, we have an agent sent by
to knock, but he did not open.

336
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:34,720
The lights were on in the house.

337
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:40,320
Call him and ask him here past
want to come.

338
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:43,093
He must ultimately a statement
test.

339
00:59:46,603 --> 00:59:48,002
Can I bring you somewhere?

340
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,945
It's cold outside.

341
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,845
You must be crazy...

342
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,476
in this weather to walk.

343
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,842
With that coat.

344
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,686
It's a sweater.

345
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:14,881
You should have seen your face.

346
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:16,960
I could not see it, but...

347
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:21,023
I'm not often in the company car.

348
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:24,428
Have patience with me.
Where do you go?

349
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:27,328
Police.

350
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:32,869
I said that hard?

351
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:36,600
I do not come anymore.
Is it a night, huh?

352
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,266
Tell me about it.

353
01:00:38,377 --> 01:00:40,776
Just kidding. Tell him not.
Better for me.

354
01:00:40,878 --> 01:00:43,904
I do not want to be accomplice
something that you did.

355
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:53,352
How can so much blood on her
nanotubes?

356
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:55,979
There's more than just happened
arson.

357
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,224
The province will pass to the evidence
to retrieve.

358
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:02,921
We do not have the equipment to such
amount of blood examination.

359
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,053
They do not talk to me.

360
01:01:04,163 --> 01:01:07,257
Did she say anything to you?
What happened, who she killed?

361
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:10,966
I do not think we have something out of her.

362
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:19,174
Who you gonna call?
- I am Sam Hunt try again.

363
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,640
I think all this is worse
than we think.

364
01:01:27,114 --> 01:01:29,048
You must let me know where
police station is.

365
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,518
For the last time I was there,
I was about 15 years.

366
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,452
I do not judge you, eh ..

367
01:01:37,189 --> 01:01:38,656
Not me.

368
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,794
Hear that sound?
This is awkward silence.

369
01:01:48,065 --> 01:01:50,055
Just kidding.

370
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,601
Okay, thank you.
We keep in touch.

371
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:02,234
They found two bodies.
- Sam and Brian?

372
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:04,468
They are still searching for the head of a
of them.

373
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:08,706
The other body is complete, only
badly burned to be identified.

374
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:11,008
I'll give you five minutes to
For answers to provide.

375
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:17,014
You know what they do with corn fields,
At the end of summer?

376
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,215
I recently drove by and I saw only
but wheat fields...

377
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:24,348
all that corn, it just stands there,
Just to rot.

378
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:26,791
You know that colorful cereal that...

379
01:02:28,629 --> 01:02:32,655
You know, the primary school.
What's that again?

380
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:35,097
What now?

381
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:37,601
Come on.

382
01:02:37,702 --> 01:02:39,693
Damn.
I rode too hard.

383
01:02:39,804 --> 01:02:42,738
I drove too hard? No, right?

384
01:02:44,141 --> 01:02:47,598
This city should always have me.
I killed my sister.

385
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:51,575
Pull over.
- He is not even registered.

386
01:02:53,181 --> 01:02:54,808
Damn.

387
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,179
Shut up and go to the side.

388
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:20,868
Colored corn.

389
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:27,868
Yes.

390
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,568
Yes. Colored corn.

391
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:38,845
I drove past there last week.
You know what they do with it?

392
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:42,146
They cut away everything, absolutely everything.

393
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:45,782
They chop it fine, corn, steal,
everything, absolutely everything...

394
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,948
and they use it as fodder.

395
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,024
My cousin told me.

396
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,559
They waste nothing in this town.

397
01:03:53,595 --> 01:03:55,585
They've learned from the Indians.

398
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:58,358
Sorry, Native Americans.

399
01:03:59,933 --> 01:04:01,298
You know...

400
01:04:01,802 --> 01:04:03,564
God, I hate this city.

401
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:07,869
So do I.

402
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:42,459
William Taylor.

403
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:47,901
Did you know him?

404
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:07,712
There was a body...

405
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:13,084
headless.

406
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:19,156
Did you know that person?

407
01:05:48,684 --> 01:05:50,675
Will we find more bodies?

408
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:11,534
Make sure you get a ride home.

409
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:30,228
The team spot.
You want me to pick?

410
01:07:30,364 --> 01:07:31,955
No, I take him though.

411
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:34,630
Yes.

412
01:07:39,904 --> 01:07:45,170
Okay, we have someone here who
may have on research?

413
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:48,905
Yes, keep me informed.

414
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:54,545
They have three bodies were found.

415
01:07:55,316 --> 01:07:56,647
And head.

416
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:04,986
Eric, good to see you.

417
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:08,184
It's been a terrible night.
- Tell me anything.

418
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:09,523
What?

419
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,229
No, I saw the fire and thought you
could use some help.

420
01:08:13,597 --> 01:08:15,826
The fire is just the beginning.

421
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:18,059
They found five bodies.

422
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:21,329
And the only survivors,
is our only suspect.

423
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:23,427
And she does not want to talk.

424
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:25,632
Have you collected all the evidence?

425
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,832
Of course.

426
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:28,003
Yes.

427
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:31,134
Despite the evidence and
shouted confession...

428
01:08:32,846 --> 01:08:35,871
I feel that something is wrong.

429
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,471
Do not you think they did it?

430
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:40,608
Her cigarette lighter and its ways
that she is the arsonist.

431
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:42,947
Accidentally or not, but...

432
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:47,247
I do not think that a person's head
can cut off.

433
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,822
She knows what happened, she knows who
did it, but she says nothing.

434
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:55,088
What do you want me to do?

435
01:08:56,764 --> 01:08:58,391
You can guard the fort.

436
01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:01,126
Marcus and I go to the field,
see what else we can find.

437
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:04,067
Think you can handle it?

438
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,503
I am Agent Eric Schroeder.

439
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:30,515
I'll get some more evidence.

440
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:46,489
You've been through a lot tonight.

441
01:11:54,869 --> 01:11:57,530
They find quite a lot of bodies out there.

442
01:11:59,206 --> 01:12:01,901
They were your friends, right?

443
01:12:08,513 --> 01:12:09,377
Yes.

444
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:12,173
They were.

445
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:18,712
Besides Sam Hunt
the owner of the labyrinth.

446
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:22,347
He was no friend of yours, yet
is also dead.

447
01:12:23,824 --> 01:12:25,155
Did you kill him?

448
01:12:27,195 --> 01:12:28,422
No.

449
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,227
Of course not.

450
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:39,100
To tell you the truth, I think
you have killed nobody.

451
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:43,869
I think you and your friends...

452
01:12:43,974 --> 01:12:46,874
alone are guilty, in the wrong
his place at the wrong time.

453
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:54,710
But, I'm just new here
In a small town.

454
01:12:55,049 --> 01:12:59,110
It can be anyone here cares
what I think.

455
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:08,923
I can not help you...

456
01:13:10,228 --> 01:13:13,628
unless you tell me exactly what
happened there.

457
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,693
I know it's difficult.
I know.

458
01:13:19,768 --> 01:13:24,227
But I gotta know what you know,
so we can leave behind us.

459
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,137
Would you tell me what happened there?

460
01:13:35,513 --> 01:13:37,811
Yes, I will.

461
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,107
Good.

462
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:40,781
Good.

463
01:13:41,986 --> 01:13:44,011
Let's start with the first thing.

464
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:49,456
Who did you kill,
or do you have to kill?

465
01:13:56,964 --> 01:13:58,897
The man in the red sweater.

466
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,999
Is this man a name?

467
01:14:03,469 --> 01:14:05,027
We have never spoken.

468
01:14:06,171 --> 01:14:08,695
But you have good look at him,
You can...

469
01:14:08,806 --> 01:14:12,502
identify him as you would see him
suspects in a row?

470
01:14:13,043 --> 01:14:15,034
I do not know, it was dark.

471
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:22,947
Why were you so late in
the labyrinth?

472
01:14:23,985 --> 01:14:26,316
Because we arrived late and...

473
01:14:27,388 --> 01:14:29,912
we still wanted to see.

474
01:14:30,023 --> 01:14:32,685
So you found you are trespassing?

475
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:38,961
Yes.

476
01:14:40,831 --> 01:14:44,197
And you have Sam Hunt, the owner,
there too?

477
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:46,495
The man with the gun?

478
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,269
Has he found you and your friends?

479
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,978
Maybe...

480
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,376
We played...

481
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:10,549
We got lost during each
Playing a silly game.

482
01:15:10,654 --> 01:15:12,349
What do you mean...

483
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:18,018
What do you mean stupid game?

484
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:25,724
Collin.
Has a special version of Tag...

485
01:15:25,833 --> 01:15:28,460
and who it is...

486
01:15:30,603 --> 01:15:32,161
Wearing something...

487
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,031
For example, a scarf or a headband.
- An ornament?

488
01:15:41,311 --> 01:15:42,243
Yes.

489
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,107
The chain.

490
01:15:49,418 --> 01:15:50,907
Like tonight.

491
01:15:54,456 --> 01:15:58,118
So we got rid of each other.

492
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,649
And he found us.

493
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:03,688
Who won?

494
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:08,329
Pardon?

495
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:11,595
The game.
Who won the game?

496
01:16:14,504 --> 01:16:16,495
I'm sorry, I do not understand.

497
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,804
Excuse me.

498
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:42,055
Yes, I understand, sir.

499
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:46,393
I will make sure that they
completely at ease.

500
01:16:49,531 --> 01:16:53,194
No.
I do not think they did it.

501
01:16:55,503 --> 01:16:57,027
The evidence does not lie.

502
01:16:58,705 --> 01:16:59,763
Okay.

503
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:08,448
Okay.

504
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,383
You can shape yourself.

505
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:24,362
They have found a body.

506
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,504
That's number five.

507
01:18:28,741 --> 01:18:33,040
But they still have no husband
found in a red coat.

508
01:18:34,913 --> 01:18:37,039
I know you've killed anyone.

509
01:18:38,683 --> 01:18:40,810
Help me figure out who did it.

510
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,588
It's all my fault.

511
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,288
They're all dead by me.

512
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:54,589
I've lit the grain.
The farmer shot my friend down.

513
01:18:56,897 --> 01:18:58,296
Jordan, are you sure?

514
01:18:58,398 --> 01:19:00,058
It's all my fault.

515
01:19:02,134 --> 01:19:05,591
I will now write.
I admit in court.

516
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:08,866
I can not take it anymore.
I can not handle the guilt.

517
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:14,037
Okay.

518
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:33,086
It's okay.

519
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:36,790
You do what is right.

520
01:19:50,839 --> 01:19:52,568
That's it.

521
01:19:53,341 --> 01:19:55,274
Bitch.

522
01:19:55,376 --> 01:19:57,776
Sample.
You killed my friends.

523
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:01,574
You got me stung several times,
we are right, do not you think?

524
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:04,547
I'll kill you.
- You've done much more than that.

525
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,208
You have all been murdered.

526
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:09,946
With the DNA that I've left you,
and you signed declaration...

527
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:13,181
I would say that you all for everything
have provided.

528
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:17,456
See, I told you so.

529
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,757
You did not kill anyone.

530
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:51,510
You thought I would give you the gun
with bullets?

531
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:58,511
You've shot with that gun,
at the police station.

532
01:22:59,385 --> 01:23:01,046
Lucky for me...

533
01:23:01,954 --> 01:23:04,012
You can focus evil and counting.

534
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:06,855
And so...

535
01:23:08,325 --> 01:23:10,691
When you brushed my leg...

536
01:23:20,868 --> 01:23:22,699
I could attack you...

537
01:23:25,205 --> 01:23:26,263
and I shot you down.

538
01:23:30,209 --> 01:23:33,940
At least that is what is
The police report will stand.

539
01:23:38,982 --> 01:23:43,613
All right, fights back.
That makes it all believable.

540
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:50,591
That gun is loaded.

541
01:23:54,695 --> 01:23:58,289
What do you say,
after you have shot me?

542
01:23:58,398 --> 01:24:00,457
I've killed your friends?

543
01:24:00,567 --> 01:24:02,124
Who will you believe?

544
01:24:02,935 --> 01:24:05,495
If you kill me, you go there too.

545
01:24:05,603 --> 01:24:07,036
That I do not care.

546
01:24:07,138 --> 01:24:09,197
I think so.

547
01:24:09,307 --> 01:24:11,672
I think you're like me.

548
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:13,600
You're a survivor.

549
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,233
I look at anything on you.

550
01:24:16,245 --> 01:24:20,108
Okay.
What do you want?

551
01:24:21,516 --> 01:24:22,983
An apology.

552
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:25,874
An apology?

553
01:24:26,787 --> 01:24:27,879
Really?

554
01:24:27,988 --> 01:24:29,454
Keep your hands up.

555
01:24:31,491 --> 01:24:32,423
Okay.

556
01:24:34,126 --> 01:24:35,525
I'm sorry.

557
01:24:35,627 --> 01:24:37,992
What?
- For the murder of your friends.

558
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:41,393
For the murder of Sam Hunt
for the murder of Brian.

559
01:24:41,499 --> 01:24:45,798
You did not know about him, but
I'm sorry anyway.

560
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:52,467
You're a monster.

561
01:24:56,877 --> 01:25:00,573
You know what I regret most.

562
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,105
I did not kill you.

563
01:25:08,652 --> 01:25:10,142
What happens here, damn.

564
01:25:11,655 --> 01:25:14,623
The lights went out and they attacked me.

565
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:16,988
I could even see anything when I told her
shot.

566
01:25:19,928 --> 01:25:22,157
She's alive.
Call an ambulance.

567
01:25:28,268 --> 01:25:31,898
What do you say
after you have shot me?

568
01:25:32,004 --> 01:25:34,029
I've killed your friends?

569
01:25:34,373 --> 01:25:35,862
Who will you believe?

570
01:25:36,407 --> 01:25:40,474
If you kill me, you go there too.
- That I do not care.

571
01:25:40,577 --> 01:25:44,712
I think so.
I think you're like me.

572
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:47,206
You're a survivor.

573
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:48,882
Eric...

574
01:25:49,584 --> 01:25:51,176
put the gun down.

575
01:25:54,788 --> 01:25:56,016
What?

576
01:25:56,123 --> 01:25:58,454
Put the gun down.

577
01:26:00,927 --> 01:26:02,326
Keep your hands up.

578
01:26:05,497 --> 01:26:06,896
I'm sorry.

579
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:09,830
What?
- For the murder of your friends.

580
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:12,629
For the murder of Sam Hunt
for the murder of Brian.

581
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:16,966
You did not know about him, but
I'm sorry anyway.

582
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:18,733
You're a monster.

583
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:22,071
You know what I regret most.

584
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,775
I did not kill you.
