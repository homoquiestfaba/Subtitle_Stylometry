And you think
Ugh, she's way needy.

<i>She's either. . .
fucked up. . .</i>

91

Hey, sweetheart, you know me. If there's
pussy on the menu, I am there. Out.

101
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,316
For me, it's not a question
of to date or not to date.

102
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,472
For me, it's a question
of to hose or not to hose.

103
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,869
And I hate missing
the opportunity.

104
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,349
<i>I think you're born with
a certain number of hosings. . .</i>

105
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,795
and each time you pass it up
it's gone forever.

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,434
It's Iike you're born with
a certain number of hard ons.

107
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,476
Or maybe it's measured
in quarts.

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,313
Or in my case, gaIIons.
Whatever.

109
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,039
As Iong as there's pussy on the menu?
That's what he said.

110
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,031

Yeah.

You know, I work hard
I pIay hard.

119
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,709
Why go out with
a bunch of guys?

120
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,837
I know where I want to end up
and it's not with a bunch of guys.

121
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,037
I don't want to end up

You kow, the rltu al

129
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,599
It's not about getting cIose to someone
'cause you're not.

130
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,240
<i>It's easy to think you're
getting cIose to someone. . .</i>

131
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,629
because you're having sex
with them.

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,676
We're taIking about the constant

Yeah, you r teeth
a re rlght there

167
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,798
The probIem is once you get down there
it's kind of awkward to stop.

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,677
You have Iockjaw. Your saIiva
is coming out everywhere.

169
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,512
You kow
you r eyes a re waterlg

170
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,831
I find myseIf thinking
Am I even doing this right?

171
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,114
WeII, you Iearn.

173
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,718
<i>The bIow jobs I give today
are a Iot different. . .</i>

174
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,836
than the ones I gave
five years ago.

175
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,838
You know what, guys?
There's this cIass now in L.A.

176
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,792
It's a bIow job cIass.

177
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,150
No way!
No, it's true.

178
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,834
I have a friend. Her boyfriend gave her
a gift certificate.

179
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,715
From an ergonomic design standpoint
it's just simpIy not aII going to fit.

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,429
<i>Now, the other thing is that
from a technique standpoint. . .</i>

181
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,548
your hands and your mouth are so much
more versatiIe than your vagina.

182
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,838
You gotta be hands on. You gotta be
using your hands. There's a technique.

183
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,598
Most woe a re
ju st ot awa re o  thls

184
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,511
<i>Now, what you are doing
with these techniques. . .</i>

185
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,194
is mimicking
those sensations.

186
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,272
If you reaIIy anaIyse it, it's
a combination of technique and context.

187
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,796
It's what's being done
and actuaIIy where it's being done.

188
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,555
<i>In a car, uh. . .
in a bathroom at a party.</i>

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,235
<i>Uh. . . outdoors is good
you know.</i>

190
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,632
You get peopIe nearby.
The danger of being caught's very good.

191
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,156
Yeah l llke that

192
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,151
It's a combination
of three things

193
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,118
<i>One is the heat
the second is the moisture. . .</i>

194
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,713
and the third
is the pressure.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,631
Tongue, of course.

196
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,632

No teeth.

201
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,671
What are you taIking about?
Teeth are the best.

202
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,228
<i>First time I had
my knob shined. . .</i>

203
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880

<i>The whoIe apparatus

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,679
in EngIish and EspanoI.

209
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,792
There are just some things
that you gotta Iearn.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,558
<i>So, reaIIy what you are doing. . .</i>

211
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,596
<i>when you do these manuaI
and oraI techniques. . .</i>

212
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,636
<i>is you are mimicking
those sensations. . .</i>

213
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,518
and, in essence
creating an imposter vagina.

214
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,673
Now, going forward with that
you've chosen your Iubricants?

215
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,877
Great. You have your
diIdo du jour. Great.

216
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,679
Now, Iadies, if you can put
that aII together, okay?

217
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,274
So, Iike this
and come down.

<i>You can actuaIIy. . .

I didn't have any food in my stomach.
I'm Mikey, by the way.

Ricky being the rude
piece of shit that he is.

I'm sorry. Mike, Shawn Denigan, works

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,798

on the way home.

242
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,711
Do you know what you need?
What?

243
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,315
<i>You need a new man.
That's exactIy what I don't need. . .</i>

244
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,472
because you can't do shit
with a man, nothing.

245
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,312
I remember you
from Arizona State.

246
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,198
These guys were number one.
They came to Georgia. He's everywhere.

247
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,829
He tackIes, picks, the whoIe deaI.
Aw, the fuckin' game sucked.

248
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,434
Who does he pIay for?
Raiders.

249
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,718
And he just signed
a $5 miIIion contract.

250
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,758
<i>And. . . he's gorgeous.</i>

251
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,479
<i>WeII, his waIIet
sounds. . . gorgeous.</i>

252
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,791
He sounds Iike just your type, Miss Sara.
Yeah.

253
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,879
Shawn desperateIy wants
to be a Raiders fan, but he just can't.

254
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
Why's that?
WeII, he hasn't kiIIed anyone yet.

Come on!
Get off me, you frat boy!

258
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,111
Yeah, well, that's the joke

259
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,077
Right?

260
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,039
Two guys, they're so into each other
that they wish one of'em had a vagina?

261
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,193
So they both go to Sweden. They both
get it done to surprise the other one.

262
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,158
That's the joke.

263
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,119
Ricky ever teII you he was aIways
the Iast one picked for kick baII?

264
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,269
The ex change students
were making fun of him!

265
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,793
Fucker.

266
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,555
Sorry about that. Let's get this
IoveIy coupIe a round.

Yea, y avou rltel

<i>AII right, guys. . . How many
footbaII pIayers are coming tonight?</i>

269
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,233
The whoIe team's meeting us.
We're gonna do aII of'em.

270
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,356
Oh, yeah!
Whoo hoo! How many is that?

271
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,871
So how many are gonna be there?
Three, maybe four.

272
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,310
Good Iooking, these chicks?
What do you think?

273
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,198
Have I met Shawn?
I don't think so.

274
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,511
He's the one that introduced me
to Rick. They work together.

275
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,876
What's the name of this Iawyer
this one you're after?

276
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,832
Jane.
Her name is Jane.

277
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,793
She's pretty speciaI
this girI.

278
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,839
You 'll see
You 'll see whe you eet her

279
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,037
She's a cIerk at the D.A.'s office.
Shawn introduced us.

280
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,317
<i>He's dating a friend of hers. . . Sara.
Two Iawyers in bed together.</i>

281
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,676
Anyway, Shawn is Iike
the perfect gentIeman.

282
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,719
He takes me to the most amazing pIaces.
What do you think?

283
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,554
P retty lce, hu h?

284
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,074
This is so beautifuI.

285
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,118
He orders for both of us.
He opens doors.

286
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,236
You just Iike him
'cause he orders appetizers.

287
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,711
I aIways said I wouId never marry a guy
unIess he orders appetizers.

288
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,792
It is a true refIection
of his IifestyIe.

289
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,111
We shouId start with
some appetizers, huh?

290
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,395
I Iove appetizers.

291
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,632
We went out twice together aIready
and the guy hasn't even tried to kiss me.

292
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,757
<i>Honey. . . he hasn't
kissed you yet. . .</i>

293
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,308
because he respects you.

294
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,231
Can you understand
that concept?

295
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,118
No!

296
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,830
I can't, you know. This whoIe
nice guy thing is just too much for me.

297
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,792
It's just too personaI.

298
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,751
I don't think
you shouId worry about it.

299
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,673

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,030
I mean
he doesn't even drink.

302
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,191
You kow what?

303
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,159
I mean, I haven't even been to a cIub

Yeah. You guys mind

There's three guys, right?

309
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,355
Rick, Shawn and Mike.

310
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,034
Is there a fourth?
There is, and there isn't.

311
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,351

Oh, no, it's Trent.

519
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,355
<i>Wait a minute. What. . .
What happened to you?</i>

520
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,158
Nothin'.

521
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,118
Nothin'.

522
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,997
You okay?

523
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,830
Sure.

524
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,832
You want some?
Nah, I don't drink.

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,397
Better go back lslde

527
00:42:28,717 --> 00:42:31,311
Sometimes there's just
this need to come.

528
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:34,992
<i>It just. . .
sort of takes over.</i>

529
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,545
It reaIIy doesn't matter
who, when, where or how.

530
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,787
It's actuaIIy
not even about that.

531
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:43,506
<i>It's just. . . about coming.</i>

532
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:59,753
The thing about it is this

533
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,187
A guy wants to come
he comes.

534
00:43:02,277 --> 00:43:05,747
With a woman, it takes
a IittIe bit of effort.

535
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:10,514
So that's the Ieast you can do
is make the effort.

536
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,707
Here's what women
don't get, aII right?

537
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:23,267
Guys Iike eating pussy.
I speak for myseIf.

538
00:43:23,357 --> 00:43:26,667
Bu t l cou ld take a paper hbag
dow  there a d ju st hu , okay?

539
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:29,066
I couId do fuckin'
spreadsheets down there.

540
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:31,751
Some women won't Iet you.

541
00:43:31,837 --> 00:43:33,714
It can be a reaI issue
with them.

542
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:36,106
Bu t, l tell you , l gotta
have that l y a rseal

543
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,791
Otherwise, I'm out of there.

544
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,708
I just enjoy it too much.

545
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:57,072
<i>I watch them.
I hear them thinking. . .</i>

546
00:43:57,157 --> 00:43:59,671
Shit, he's doing me.
I got to do him.

547
00:43:59,757 --> 00:44:02,555
They think it's something
we don't Iike. But I ask you this

548
00:44:02,637 --> 00:44:05,071
Is this something you wouId do
if you did not Iike it?

549
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:18,791
<i>I have this ongoing discussion
with my girIfriends. . .</i>

550
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:21,306
<i>about whether
oraI sex is sex. . .</i>

551
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:23,831
or whether it's just
a part of making out.

552
00:44:34,437 --> 00:44:38,350
There's a whoIe Iist
of sexuaI acts that don't count.

553
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:42,191
One is a bIow job, especiaIIy with
someone you don't want to sIeep with.

554
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:46,031
Another wouId be having sex in a foreign
country whiIe you're on vacation.

555
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,994
That doesn't count either.

556
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:51,308
Bu t klsslg soeoe
you really llke, that cou ts

557
00:44:57,797 --> 00:45:01,392
A woman has an orgasm

558
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:05,186
<i>I was doing this one. . . Bertha.
I swear to God, it was Iike a 7.5.</i>

559
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:09,429
It's Iike I'm Iookin' at my dick going
Jesus, why can't you do that?

560
00:45:12,197 --> 00:45:16,793
<i>I know some guys who. . .
hide it when they hump.</i>

561
00:45:16,877 --> 00:45:20,586
<i>They IiteraIIy. . .
don't make a sound.</i>

562
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,396
<i>I mean, some women pretend
that they're coming when they're not. . .</i>

563
00:45:23,477 --> 00:45:26,913
but some men pretend
they're not coming when they are.

564
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:17,954
- You , u h

What's wrong?

571
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:57,755
I don't know.

572
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:00,112
I don't know.

573
00:48:00,197 --> 00:48:03,667
God, I just get too drunk.

Come to the gym with me.

I hate going by myseIf.

At Ieast you got to sIeep

Where'd you sIeep?

Which one?

594
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:30,353
I'm passed out in the gutter
right? No money.

595
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,587
There must've been
a car accident.

596
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:35,987
I don't exactIy know what happened
'cause I didn't wake up.

Yeah

598
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:04,146
Next thing I know, I'm on
my way to the emergency room.

599
00:50:04,237 --> 00:50:06,228
They thought you were
in the car accident?

600
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:10,196
They thought I fIew
out the window.

601
00:50:10,277 --> 00:50:11,995
Then what'd you do?

602
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:17,186
<i>I went with it. . .</i>

603
00:50:17,277 --> 00:50:21,714
<i>'cause they, you know. . .
weII, they were going north.</i>

604
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:25,312
I got out, and then I made it a coupIe
of bIocks, but I had to Iie down.

I just couIdn't waIk.

606
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:30,387

00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:48,113
I waIked outside

00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:52,667
Oh, pIease. No.

I thought you sIept in the gutter.
No, no, no, before that.

699
00:55:39,037 --> 00:55:42,427
I think that penetration

813
01:04:54,397 --> 01:04:56,115
Bu t she does't say a thlg

814
01:04:57,437 --> 01:05:00,270
No, wait.
Yeah.

815
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:04,236
Do you have a condom?
No, no. I'm sorry.

816
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:44,309
She wanted me.

817
01:05:45,477 --> 01:05:47,547
I wanted her.

818
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,746
Are you okay? What happened?

819
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:05,909

01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:21,393
AII right. That's it.
We're done.

822
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,786
Hey, cowboy.
We're done.

823
01:06:23,877 --> 01:06:26,596
We're not done
untiI we say it's done.

824
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:28,986
No. No. Mike.

825
01:06:29,077 --> 01:06:31,113
She was crazy
though, man.

826
01:06:32,357 --> 01:06:34,791
She Iooks normaI
but deep down, she is gone.

827
01:06:34,997 --> 01:06:37,795
Yappin' about her oId boyfriend
the whoIe time.

01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:39,788
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap
Begglg e to su ck her eck

829
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:43,626
The whoIe time I'm thinking
This chick is a fuckin' psycho.

830
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:50,472
She wanted to get back
at this Keith doofus for dumping her.

831
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:07,517
There's another reason why she got
so upset, and this is sick in the head.

832
01:07:08,717 --> 01:07:10,628
You su re you do't
wa t to coe?

833
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:12,548
How couId you not be starving?
I'm positive.

01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:15,549
<i>Right before I Ieft her

835
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:17,593
Okay.

836
01:07:18,957 --> 01:07:21,107
Whitney? Whitney?
I caIIed her the wrong name.

837
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:23,074
What? What?
Just get the fuck out. Whitney.

838
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:25,387
Get the fuck out. Leave!
I caIIed her Whitney.

839
01:07:25,477 --> 01:07:27,593
Get the fuck out of here
God damn it!

840
01:07:30,597 --> 01:07:32,428

Can we get a statement?
Any comments?

01:07:58,557 --> 01:08:01,071
Do you have a statement?
Over here, Mike.

846
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:02,988
What do we know about Sara?

847
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:05,671
Just what she said when
I took her to the hospitaI.

848
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:08,112
Is she okay?

849
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:11,746
<i>She has, Iike, a bump here
with a cut. . .</i>

850
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:15,625
and then she just has
some cuts and some hickeys on her neck.

851
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:19,188
Sara, I'm Dr Cook.
Hi.

852
01:08:19,277 --> 01:08:21,507
It's okay.

853
01:08:22,197 --> 01:08:24,233
No, no, no!
Sweetheart, it's okay.

854
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:26,069
Come on. It's okay.
It's okay. It's aII right.

855
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:28,273
It's just the doctor.
She's just here to heIp you.

856
01:08:28,357 --> 01:08:30,507
Come here. Come sit back down.
I'm right here.

857
01:08:30,597 --> 01:08:33,031
It is a safe pIace. Come sit.
Sara, you're in a safe pIace.

858
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:35,790
- The stopl

859
01:08:35,997 --> 01:08:39,785
Come sit. Now, the three of us are going

01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:43,586
AII right. It's okay. Just the three
of us are gonna take the jacket off.

861
01:08:53,357 --> 01:08:56,269
Ex cuse me, nurse? Can her father
give us a statement, pIease?

862
01:08:56,357 --> 01:08:58,632
Can we speak to Mr OIswang?
Stand back, pIease.

863
01:09:00,517 --> 01:09:03,634
I thought I couId trust him, you know?

864
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:07,591
I thought that he wouId never
do something Iike this.

865
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:10,510
He'd never want to screw up
his career Iike this.

866
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:12,508
AII right.
That's enough.

867
01:09:12,597 --> 01:09:14,508
<i>I'm sorry, but we have to. . .
No, don't teII me you're sorry!</i>

You 're ot sorry
You do't kow what sorry ls

869
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:19,477
Sorry is when this son of a bitch
is in jaiI for the rest of his Iife.

870
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:22,947
Sir? WouId you Iike
to wait outside, sir?

871
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:29,432
It's okay.
Yeah?

872
01:09:30,597 --> 01:09:33,907
- You su re?
- You all rlght?

873
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:38,914
I'm okay.

874
01:09:40,037 --> 01:09:42,835
I was just reaIIy scared.

875
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:52,875
<i>We got back to my apartment. . .</i>

876
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,075
<i>at about 300. . .</i>

877
01:09:58,037 --> 01:09:59,755
3 1 5.

878
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:04,152
We waIked down by the ocean
for a IittIe whiIe.

879
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:05,989
Come here.

880
01:10:10,757 --> 01:10:13,066
Come here. Come on.
It's aII right.

881
01:10:44,717 --> 01:10:47,595
Come here.

882
01:10:55,597 --> 01:10:57,588
He was very aggressive.

883
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:01,112
And it started to rain.

884
01:11:04,037 --> 01:11:07,473
Come on.
We're going to your pIace.

885
01:11:07,557 --> 01:11:10,993
So, just to get out of there
we went back to my apartment.

886
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:22,469
- You shou ld go lt's gettlg pretty late
- Yes lo, walt

887
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:24,627

One second.

- Please l a  soaked Coe here
- lo, o, o You shou ld go

889
01:11:29,157 --> 01:11:31,227
We got together a IittIe bit.

890
01:11:32,677 --> 01:11:34,508
It was okay.

891
01:11:34,597 --> 01:11:38,306
Ex cept his breath
made me kind of nauseous.

892
01:11:39,557 --> 01:11:42,196
A Iot of booze.

893
01:11:46,597 --> 01:11:49,794
Anyway
Come here.

894
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:53,108
Come here.
He tried to undo my bra.

895
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:58,270
Bu t he was so wasted that

896
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,188
I had to undo it myseIf.

897
01:12:00,277 --> 01:12:02,950
Get this thing off.
Okay. I'II take it off.

898
01:12:03,037 --> 01:12:07,394
I'II take it off.

899
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:09,513
<i>I didn't mind, though. . .</i>

900
01:12:09,597 --> 01:12:13,715
'cause I knew I wasn't
gonna Iet it go any further.

901
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:18,388
'Cause I just wanted to go to sIeep.
Where were you at this time?

902
01:12:21,117 --> 01:12:22,948
My apa rtet

903
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:24,993
Where in your apartment?

904
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:28,795
My llvlg roo

905
01:12:28,997 --> 01:12:31,511

getting out of controI.

910
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:54,949
He shoved his hand
up my skirt.

911
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,471
<i>He kept saying that. . .</i>

912
01:12:57,557 --> 01:13:00,754
<i>he was reaIIy horny, though. . .
Stop. Leave!</i>

913
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:05,627

<i>So then, he took me. . .</i>

<i>Come on!
And grabbed me. . .</i>

918
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:30,309

Stop it!

<i>He threw me on the bed. . .</i>

Iike I was some kind

922
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:41,670
Stop it! Get the fuck out of here!
What is your probIem?

923
01:13:41,757 --> 01:13:43,475
<i>And then. . .</i>

<i>he. . .</i>

926
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:06,549
he puIIed my panties aside.

927
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:14,270
Get out! Stop!

928
01:14:14,357 --> 01:14:18,350
<i>His hands were between my Iegs
and he. . .</i>

929
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:22,316
I couIdn't stop him.
I tried.

930
01:14:23,437 --> 01:14:25,234
Stop!

931
01:14:50,997 --> 01:14:54,672
<i>A few minutes. . . went by. . .</i>

934
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:22,953
Have we got evidence

Please, M r Olswa g

This is not
gonna be easy.

940
01:15:46,117 --> 01:15:49,154
This guy, Penorisi
he's got a high profiIe.

941
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:51,751
I don't care if he's
goddam Joe Montana.

942
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:30,313
What's up, bro?

943
01:16:32,317 --> 01:16:34,148
Dude, what's happening?

944
01:16:34,237 --> 01:16:35,955
<i>That Mike guy. . .</i>

01:16:37,277 --> 01:16:39,632

01:16:44,477 --> 01:16:46,707
Oh, hoIy fuck.

01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:52,908
Dude, I'm I'm sorry.

949
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:58,388
Jesus Christ.

950
01:16:58,477 --> 01:17:00,593
<i>I shouId've done something.
I mean. . .</i>

951
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:05,351
I shouId've stopped her from
getting in that car with him.

952
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:11,188
<i>Oh, yeah, I couId. . . Oh, dude, I couId
see that happening.</i>

953
01:17:13,277 --> 01:17:16,235
I can totaIIy see that guy
doing something Iike that.

954
01:17:19,557 --> 01:17:21,275
Fuck.

955
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:28,555
Fuck, what happens now?

956
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:32,226
I meet a woman in a bar.

957
01:17:32,317 --> 01:17:35,389
And she says to me
I'm not wearing any underwear.

958
01:17:35,477 --> 01:17:39,675
What am I supposed to think?
I'm gonna think she's gonna come across.

959
01:17:39,757 --> 01:17:42,112
Women hit on me aII the time.

960
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:44,392
And they are not
interested in my mind.

961
01:17:44,477 --> 01:17:48,755
<i>There's something
about having sex forced on you. . .</i>

962
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:50,948
that does cut to the chase.

963
01:17:52,597 --> 01:17:55,430
You do't have to take
a y resposlhblllty or lt

964
01:17:55,517 --> 01:17:58,589
I'm taIking about
fantasies now.

965
01:17:58,677 --> 01:18:01,953
This is not an invitation
to rape.

966
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:05,748
<i>I'm just saying. . .</i>

967
01:18:05,837 --> 01:18:08,556
that's why the rape fantasy
is so appeaIing.

968
01:18:09,877 --> 01:18:12,675
When you're a kid, it's a game.

969
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:16,067
First base, second base
third base.

970
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:19,274
And if a guy hits a home run
with a girI, then he's a winner.

971
01:18:21,677 --> 01:18:23,429
And she's a sIut.

972
01:18:25,357 --> 01:18:27,109
Is it reaIIy
any different now?

973
01:18:37,397 --> 01:18:39,547
This just came in from the station.
Yeah, thanks, man.

974
01:18:40,997 --> 01:18:43,386
Want me to stick around?
No, no, take off.

975
01:18:43,477 --> 01:18:45,195
Thanks.

976
01:18:57,037 --> 01:18:58,629
Where is she?

977
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:02,630
I don't give a shit. I want his neck broken.
I understand.

978
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:09,110
Hey, Iook me in the eye.
Okay.

That's what I pay you for.

984
01:19:27,037 --> 01:19:29,756
Don't teII me how tough it is.
I wanna know what makes his dick hard.

985
01:19:31,397 --> 01:19:33,831
It's okay.

986
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:41,231
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

987
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:43,433
We need to taIk

988
01:19:43,517 --> 01:19:45,633
Come here.

990
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:51,034
That's 20 years per count
in the state of CaIifornia.

991
01:19:51,117 --> 01:19:52,948
That's just what
you're up against.

992
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:55,426
<i>Everything that you've
ever done in your Iife. . .</i>

993
01:19:55,517 --> 01:19:58,589

996
01:20:04,237 --> 01:20:06,068
What does it matter
what they fucking ask?

997
01:20:06,157 --> 01:20:08,625
<i>The guy shouId be executed.
We know that, Emma. . .</i>

998
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:11,470
If you knew anything about the IegaI
system, you'd know that's not the issue.

999
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:14,435
The issue is, if she was raped
how do you prove that in a court of Iaw?

1000
01:20:14,517 --> 01:20:16,587
- That ls the lssu e
- L ?

1001
01:20:18,237 --> 01:20:19,955
If I was raped?

1002
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:26,033
Go ahead, Jane.

1003
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:29,154
Ask me. Ask me what you think
that they wouId ask.

1004
01:20:29,237 --> 01:20:32,434
How did you get home?
We took a cab to her pIace.

1005
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,348
Who paid for it?
I did.

1006
01:20:34,437 --> 01:20:36,792
It's a Iong ride to Santa Monica.
How much was it?

1007
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:38,754
Twenty five doIIars
with the tip.

1008
01:20:38,957 --> 01:20:40,788
P retty eager o  you

1009
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,788
What exactIy did you think
was gonna happen?

1010
01:20:42,877 --> 01:20:45,789
What happened when you got there?
We went down to the beach.

1011
01:20:45,877 --> 01:20:47,708
And?

1012
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:50,989
<i>And. . . we got together, I guess.
No, no, no.</i>

1013
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:53,227
How did you get together?
Did you kiss?

1014
01:20:53,317 --> 01:20:55,785
Did you baII her? Did you fuck her
in the sand? What? You've gotta teII me.

1015
01:20:55,997 --> 01:20:58,431
<i>We kissed, and, uh. . .
He kissed you where?</i>

1016
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:01,554
Standing up? Sitting down?
Down. We were down on the sand.

1017
01:21:01,637 --> 01:21:05,550
<i>And?
And. . . we dry humped.</i>

1018
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:09,107
What does that mean?
We had sex with our cIothes on.

1019
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,108
Okay.

1020
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:14,030
And it started to rain
and she wanted to go inside.

1021
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:16,073
And then you went back
to the apartment?

1022
01:21:16,157 --> 01:21:18,955
Then he came inside.
You went inside the apartment.

1023
01:21:19,037 --> 01:21:22,712
What happened next?
I was a IittIe drunk, Jane.

1024
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:25,265
H ave you ever hbee
really d ru k?

1025
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,385
What do you mean?

1026
01:21:31,477 --> 01:21:34,787
WeII, have you ever
had a bIackout?

1027
01:21:34,997 --> 01:21:37,465
Jane.
A Iapse in your memory?

1028
01:21:37,557 --> 01:21:39,513
You know what a bIackout is, don't you?
Jane, don't.

1029
01:21:39,597 --> 01:21:41,428
Why not?

1030
01:21:41,517 --> 01:21:43,792
AII right
then you started making Iove.

1031
01:21:43,877 --> 01:21:46,391
Then what happened?

1032
01:21:52,237 --> 01:21:54,990
I don't know.
What do you mean?

1033
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:57,432
I don't know what happened.

1034
01:21:57,517 --> 01:21:59,667
<i>I don't understand.
You. . .</i>

1035
01:21:59,757 --> 01:22:02,555
I passed out hard, Ricky
and now I can't remember.

1036
01:22:02,637 --> 01:22:04,468
You kow what a hblackou t ls

1037
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:06,513
I don't get Iike that.

1038
01:22:06,597 --> 01:22:10,033
What, are you saying
you don't know?

1039
01:22:10,117 --> 01:22:11,311
Okay.

1040
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,030
I don't.

1041
01:22:18,117 --> 01:22:19,948
Gina Perry's birthday party.

1042
01:22:20,037 --> 01:22:21,948
Don't you remember?

1043
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:26,588
You sort of bIacked out

1044
01:22:29,557 --> 01:22:32,788
Hi.

Yeah, I can see that.
Hey, fuck off.

01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:41,111
<i>Hey, honey, why don't
we go to the bathroom. . .</i>

1048
01:22:41,197 --> 01:22:44,633
And then the night
that you broke up with Keith.

1049
01:22:44,717 --> 01:22:45,706
You had alcohol polsolg

1050
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:48,226
We took you to the hospitaI
and they pumped your stomach.

1051
01:22:50,357 --> 01:22:54,191
Don't you remember
how mad you were the next day?

I didn't rape her, Rick.

1055
01:23:06,597 --> 01:23:08,553
I know I didn't rape her.

1056
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:10,707
