LIBERTY: Make sure you
 compliment the house.

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,370
-Libby.

4
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,070
Hi.

5
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,710
-Cory, this is
 Jake, my boyfriend.

6
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,170
-Hi, nice to meet you, Jake.

7
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,190
-Hi, uh-- congratulations.

8
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,890
-Thanks.

9
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,200
Come on in.

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,380
I didn't know you
 were bringing anyone.

11
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,150
-Neither did I.
 Great house, really.

12
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,090
Oh, right, like it's work.

13
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,450
-I'm telling you, it's a lot
 more work than you think.

14
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,230
OK, fine.

15
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,760
You're lying in bed with
 this beautiful woman, right?

16
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,430
But the camera's
 like a foot away.

The lights are
 beating down on you.

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,930

 you where to put

your hands, your face,
 your lips, your--

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,430
-Your?

21
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,660
-No, not that.

22
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,630
Come on.

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,820
-What?

24
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,520
-Hey, hey.

25
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,950
You guys shouldn't be having
 so much fun without us.

26
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,770
JAKE: We're not.

27
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,280

 the hardships of life

 hard life, I'm just saying.

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,110

-Hey, wait until
 after the toast.

To my best friend

 for the rest of her life.

-Aw.

36
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,140
-Now you may kiss the bride.

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,540
And you may kiss me.

38
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,360

Mm.

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,520
Tasted worse.

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,260
-This, um, ill-mannered rogue
 is unfortunately the best man

44
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,900
that I could find
 to be my best man.

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,490

-Oh, sorry, Liberty and Jake.

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,370
-Hi.

50
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,640
-I'm sorry we didn't wait, but
 we didn't know where you went.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,190
-I told you, I went
 to the liquor store.

52
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,360
I would have been
 back a lot sooner

 which way he's going.

 a-- just a little more?

58
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,250
-Yes, it will.

Damn these shoes.

61
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,560
I told her to get
 me a size 13 wide.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,420
She decides 12 and 1/2 normal.

63

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,610

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,900

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,810
-I don't rent.

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,210
I bought it.

It should come in handy.

I attend a lot of benefits.

71
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,940
In fact, that's how
 I first met Cliff.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,640
-Really?

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,950
How long ago was that?

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,370
-Must be about six years now.

75
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,130
Yeah, it was right before
 he got his first series.

76
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,180
JAKE: And you've been
 close all this time?

77
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,280
-Very close.

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,050
-Then were you surprised?

79
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,970
I mean, it's the Wednesday
 before maybe the biggest

80
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,160
weekend of my whole career.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,870
I have got this huge
 meeting on Monday,

82
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,640
which I should be preparing for.

83
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,280
Liberty calls me into
 her office and says--

84
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,090
-You work with Liberty?

85
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,790
-Yeah.

86
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,600
We work at a sporting
 goods manufacturer

87
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,580
in the design department.

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,550
We're sort of co-- you
 know, I mean she tends

89
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,480
to facilitate my
 work in a way that--

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,440
-She's your boss?

91
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,140
-Right.

92
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,150
So I-- I really can't
 tell her that I'm

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,030
meeting with another company,
 even though I already

94
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,890
did present my designs to
 her and she ignored them.

95
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,400
You're-- you're
 very good at that.

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,250
-Yes, I am.

97
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,180
Allow me.

98
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,880
-Oh.

99
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,630
Oh.

100
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,750
I mean, we've only been
 dating for a couple weeks,

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,150
if you can even call it that.

102
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,770
You know, I was always
 interested in her,

103
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,920
but she never seemed to care.

104
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,370
And then suddenly,
 we go out once.

105
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,210
Then, we go out again.

106
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,240
Then we even-- yeah, you know?

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,070
But I didn't think
 it was serious.

108
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,080
And then she says her best
 friend in the whole world--

109
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,750
everything with Liberty
 is in the whole--

110
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,490
in the whole world--
 is getting married

111
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,260
and she wants we to come
 all this way to the wedding.

112
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,440
Does she really
 need me to be here?

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,140
-Does she?

114
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,840
-No.

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,030
She's the most independent
 woman I have ever met.

116
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,360
She's got a great job.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,380
She's gorgeous, athletic, runs
 marathons, teaches karate.

118
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,260
Ow, damn shoe.

119
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,680
-Hold still.

120
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,650
-She just decided she
 had to bring a boyfriend.

121
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,310
-She does do a lot
 of deciding for you.

122
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,590
-I noticed that.

123
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,290
-Hold still.

124
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,000
I just about got this.

[KNOCKING]

126
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,040
-Libby, hi.

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,270
We tripped.

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,170
Wes was helping me
 with my cummerbund.

129
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,100
It's these darn 12 and 1/2s.

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,740
I told you I wasn't normal.

131
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,670
-U, so I see.

132
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,440
-Oh, no, no, no.

133
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,680
We weren't--

134
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,540
-Of course not.

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,490
It's Jeff.

136
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,340
I cannot believe you
 gave him this number.

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,300
-For, you know, emergencies.

138
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,010
-Yeah, right.

139
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,190
Well, don't talk long.

140
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,080
The tuxedo shop closes
 in an hour in case

141
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,700
we need to make any alterations.

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,840
I'll be back.

143
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,830
-[SIGH].

144
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,520
Jeff, is there a problem?

145
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,800
Canceled?

146
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Damn.

147
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,570
How am I ever going to--
 Philip Bright himself.

148
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,220
Tonight?

149
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,100
But-- I'm at a wedding.

150
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,910
Can't you do something?

151
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,480
A train.

152
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,180
All right.

153
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,880
All right.

154
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,700
I'll try to think of something.

155
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,400
Thanks.

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,100
Bye.

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,030
They canceled Monday's meeting
 and set one up for tonight.

158
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,360
-They can't move a meeting
 like that and expect you to--

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,470
-Philip Bright can.

160
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,070
That's the amazing part.

161
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,640
My meeting on Monday
 was with some underling.

162
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,870
Tonight, I can meet
 with Philip Bright.

163
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,520
You know, the head up Bright
 Athletic Shoes, step out

164
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,040
of the darkness into
 a pair of Brights?

165
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,230
He's big, believe me.

166
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,300
My friend is friends with
 his personal assistant.

167
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,640
Bright is headed to Asia for
 this month-long business trip,

168
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,590
but she knew that he
 would have a layover

169
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,620
for a couple of hours.

170
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,600
He's agreed to meet
 with me personally if I

171
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,470
can stop by the airport tonight.

172
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,950
-And at that
 meeting, you'll, uh--

173
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,780
-Present my idea for
 a tongueless sneaker.

174
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,280
You slip it on almost
 like a slipper.

175
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,150
And then one little zip
 across the side, you're set.

176
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,510
-How astonishing.

177
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,720
-Yeah, it's a
 revolutionary breakthrough

178
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,980
in sneaker infrastructure.

179
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,450
But if Bright doesn't
 see it for a month.

180
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,390
I mean, you know the
 sneaker business.

181
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,620
-Hm.

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,770

 that would get me back in time.

183
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,350
-For Liberty to kill you.

184
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,880
And she looks like
 she could do it, too.

185
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,110
-Yeah, she'd probably make
 it look like an accident.

186
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,920
Yeah, if I leave
 before the wedding,

187
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
she'll never forgive me.

188
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,010
We'd be finished.

189
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,800
Of course, if I told
 her the reason, then--

190
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,770
then I'd be fired as well.

191
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,730
-Screwed both ways.

192
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,530
-But still, I can't miss
 this opportunity with Bright.

193
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,280
This is my whole career.

194
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,040
But I would hate to lose her.

195
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,180
She's gorgeous.

196
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,220
Sex is great.

197
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,020
She's smart, successful.

198
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,120
-Intimidating?

199
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,630
JAKE: Completely, yeah.

200
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,050
Who am I kidding?

201
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,510
A woman like that is bound
 to dump me soon anyway.

202
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,130
I've got to focus on my career.

203
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,090
-So you dump the girl?

204
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,120
The maid of honor, hours before
 her best friend's wedding?

205
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,060
-That would be about the
 lowest, most despicable

206
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,630
thing I could do, wouldn't it?

207
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,490
And if things don't work
 out well with Bright,

208
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,060
she could make my life a
 living hell at the office.

209
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,640
Let's face it, there is no way
 I can break up with her now.

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,210
-Unless you had a good reason.

211
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,960
-So you think I
 should do it then?

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,270
-Well, you'd need a good reason.

213
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,170
A really good reason.

214
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,790
Something that
 wouldn't hurt her.

215
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,350
Something that she
 wouldn't take personally.

216
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,180
We wouldn't want her to
 persecute you at the office.

217
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,410
No, it has to be something
 like-- that you're gay.

218
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,110
-Right.

219
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,080
Like she'd believe that.

220
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,270
-Well, you saw the look
 on her face before.

221
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,970
-Well, yeah.

222
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,430
That's because it
 looked like we were--

223
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,990
-Believe me, the line
 has always gotten

224

me out of trouble with woman.

-Oh, don't get me wrong, I
 don't have a problem with it.

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,770
It's your business.

-It could be yours, too.

231

-You want to-- with me?

232
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,520
-Just for appearance sake.

 in a certain position,

 problem with-- if she--

 whole-- no, I can't.

 to find out this way.

How could you do this to me?

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,480
At a wedding.

-Well no, it's not
 that you're not--

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,520
-Well, at least this
 explains the sex.

-I'm not pressuring you, Cory.

256
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,640
I-- just that, you know, I was
 married to the man for nearly

257
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,070
20 years and I'd simply like
 to know if he plans on spending

the night her after the wedding.

-The jerk.

261

I mean, he was never the
 most considerate father,

262
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,870
but usually when it
 came to you, he would--

263
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,060
-Because I didn't invite him.

264
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,090
He probably has some
 surgery scheduled

265

that he can't cancel anyway.

 is a tiny wedding.

 closest friends and family.

 eliminate your father.

OK, we didn't invite
 a lot of people.

 time to find a band, huh?

359
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:22,570
-Well, sometimes under pressure
 things can be very confusing.

360
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,900
Liberty is a wonderful
 girl, but sometimes

361
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,510
she can become a bit forceful.

362
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,880
-That's one way of putting it.

363
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:42,670
-Well, that can make things
 difficult and unclear.

364
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,880
You know, a man really shouldn't
 go off exploring new waters

365
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,170
until he's completely
 sure he hasn't explored

366
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,030
all the waters on his own shore.

367
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,890
Now, women, we're a very
 complicated group of people.

368
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:13,310
And I would hate to see you
 reject Liberty just because you

369
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:19,820
didn't understand
 everything a woman do.

370
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,290
-You know?

371
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,920
I-- I think I'm recovered.

372
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,620
Thanks.

373
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,320
-Oh, you're-- your lip or--

374
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,460
-Maybe I should still
 put the ice on it.

375
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,380
I can hold it myself.

376
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,710
-No, that's what women are for.

377
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,410
-No, really.

378
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,690
It would be better if I just--
 oh my god, I am so sorry.

379
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,840
Let me get-- maybe you should.

380
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,720
I shouldn't be in there.

381
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm gay, but I shouldn't
 be touching that-- your--

382
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
-It's OK.

383
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
It's-- huh?

384
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
-It's OK.

385
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,040
-Are you satisfied?

386
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,050
You break up with me, you
 ruin my best friend's wedding,

387
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,180
and now you got Cliff ready
 to tear his best friend apart.

388
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,850
-Mom, you've got
 to do something.

389
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,030
He may kill him.

390
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,070
-Calm down, Cory.

391
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,720
Cliff's not going to
 kill his best friend.

392
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,850
-No, I've never seem
 him like this before.

393
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,640
I think maybe he never
 knew Wes was gay.

394
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,070
-Yeah, that can be shocking
 when you think you know someone.

395
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,370
-I never meant to--

396
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,230
-Save it.

397
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,680
-OK.

398
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,050
-If you want to be
 helpful, why don't you

399
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,880
go upstairs and make
 sure nobody gets hurt.

400
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,450
At least that's what
 a real man would do.

401
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,760
[GRUNTING]

402
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,570
-Ah, Jacob.

403
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,480
Threesome?

404
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,180
-Oh.

405
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,590
I thought you locked the door?

406
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,920
You don't see a thing.

407
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,830
WES: I think he sees just fine.

408
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,980
-Yeah, but he's not going
 to tell anybody, right?

409
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,790
-Why shouldn't he tell anyone?

410
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,820
-I told you, I'll
 take care of it.

411
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,630
-Well, you better.

412
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,210
I'm running out of ways to
 make you insanely jealous.

413
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,570
LIBERTY: Jake, what's going on?

414
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,250
-Are they all right?

415
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,950
-Yeah.

416
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,570
You know, they're
 working it out.

417
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,440
-Oh, thank god.

418
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,880
-No.

419
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,520
They-- they wouldn't want you
 to-- you don't want to see.

420
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,530
You don't want to go in there.

421
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,230
-You know what?

422
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,930
He's right.

423
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,050
Let's just let them work it out.

424
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,800
Hon, you haven't even
 shown me your dress yet.

425
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,130
Don't worry about it.

426
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,190
Jake will keep an eye on them.

427
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,880
-Still feeling left out, Jacob?

428
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,440
-The girls want me
 to keep watch on you,

429
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,190
make sure you don't
 hurt each other.

430
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,780
-So Cory doesn't
 suspect anything?

431
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,480
-Not yet.

432
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,870
But if you keep this up--

433
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,710
-Perhaps you could
 lock the door?

434
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,550
-It doesn't matter
 what she suspects.

435
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,650
You're going to
 tell her about us

436
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,080
and call off this
 ridiculous wedding.

437
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,670
-Wes, you know the
 situation that I'm in.

438
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,240
-[SIGH].

439
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,230
I don't believe this.

440
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,260
-I've tried to
 make myself clear.

441
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,230
You're the one that I love, but
 if I'm going to have a career.

442
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,260
I mean, come on, Wes.

443
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,130
You heard the rumors.

444
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,950
-Yes.

445
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,690
And if you want to continue to
 be the hunk of "Primose Plaza,"

446
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,040
the world has to
 think you're straight.

447
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,080
-Exactly.

448
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,320
-Screw exactly.

449
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,230
-Look, everything's
 going to work out fine.

450
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,030
Cory knows I've
 got a busy career

451
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,940
with a lot of obligations.

452
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,920
She's going to give me space.

453
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,820
There will be plenty
 of time for us.

454
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,370
-I'm not a hobby.

455
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,880
I'm not promising to be there
 waiting for you every-- oh.

456
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,200
Every time that you
 have a spare moment.

457
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
-I really don't
 need to see this.

458
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:11,590
-Of course, if you, uh--
 continue in this-- mm-- course.

459
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,740
Ah-- [MOANING].

460
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,610
CORY: Cliff, is everything OK?

461
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,100
[KNOCKING]

462
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,760
CORY: Cliff.

463
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,180
JAKE: Oh my god.

464
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,130
Jake, you couldn't have
 waited till after the wedding?

465
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,100
-Where's Cliff?

466
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,800
WES: Cliff?

467
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,830
He's-- Cory, you should
 know that Cliff is--

468
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,990
-I'll bite it off, I swear it.

469
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:45,630
WES: That Cliff is
 in the bathroom.

470
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,200
-You get out of there.

471
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,830
I want to see your face
 when I tear it to shreds.

472
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,080
-Libby, you don't mean that.

473
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,780
LIBERTY: Yes, I do.

474
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:01,050
I bring him all the way here
 and he-- Oh, you coward.

476
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,500
Open the damn door.

-She's a mad woman.

479
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,200
You got to hide me.

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,900
-Why?

481
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,320
She's out to kill me, not you.

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,290
-Oh.

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,200
That's right.

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,390
I'll break it down.

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,760
You know I can.

-What am I supposed to do?

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,750
-I don't know.

490
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,210
That's what you
 get for involving

491
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,600
yourself with a woman.

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,360

-No kidding.

-You know, you should
 try switching to men.

503

-Oh, I'm sorry, I
 couldn't hear you

 running in there.

 all the commotion?

-Jake.

510
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,640
Running won't save you, Jake.

511
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,980
-Do I look gay?

512
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
-No.

513
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,800
Just tall.

514
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,030
-Would you care
 for any assistance?

515
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,040
-Yeah, that would
 be a good idea.

516
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Thanks.

517
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
-You're welcome.

518
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,760
That's a nice camera.

519
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,880
Take any interesting shots?

520
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,380
-No, not really.

521
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,900
All I wanted was front page
 on our little town weekly.

522
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,690
I mean, I didn't know
 Cliff Barker was gay.

523
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,070
Frannie just said that
 she head from the Crandles

524
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,860
that they saw him walk
 into the Lindrosses.

525
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,500
What am I supposed to
 just knock on the door

526
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,060
and ask for a picture?

527
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,950
I don't know.

528
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,370
I spend most of my
 time shooting two year

529
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,140
olds that have fingers
 up their noses.

530
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,820
Not that I don't like kids,
 but it can be a little tedious,

531
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,830
you know?

532
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,730
So I figure I can
 break into journalism

533
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,180
with a nice, little
 candid of Cliff Barker.

534
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,450
Maybe in his underwear.

535
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,640
I didn't know he was gay.

536
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,940
So now here I am with
 this roll of film

537
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,920
that the tabloids
 would pay a fortune for

538
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,950
and could probably give me a
 start in a whole new career.

539
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,180
Am I supposed to just sit on it?

540
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,880
I don't know.

541
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,840
I mean, it's not like I'm in
 the business of outing people.

542
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,660
But don't I have the
 right to a career?

543
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,480
-My name is Jake.

544
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,520
-Melissa, but call me Mel.

545
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,480
-Jake, you're alive.

546
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,180
-Yeah.

547
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,840
Well, she never really
 caught up with me yet.

548
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,940
Is she around?

549
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,780
LIBERTY: Jake Waverly.

550
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,410
-Libby, I am so sorry.

551
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,360
It's like it wasn't me up there.

552
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,060
Please forgive me.

553
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,150
It won't happen again.

554
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,000
-That's correct.

555
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,760
-Uh, hi, I'm Melissa Stevens,
 but you can call me Mel.

556
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,170
I'm the wedding photographer.

557
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,910
-She was having a little trouble
 finding-- finding the house.

558
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,730
So I-- well, I
 headed her down here.

559
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,020
I'm just trying to help.

560
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,480
I really do want to make up
 for any trouble I caused.

561
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,410
-That is so sweet.

562
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,110
See?

563
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,020
He's sorry, Libby.

564
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,750
JAKE: Very.

565
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,740
-One thing though, we never
 hired a wedding photographer.

566
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,930
I mean, Cliff didn't
 want any pictures

567
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,540
by a stranger that
 might end up in a--

568
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,620
-Cliff is the one who hired her.

569
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,660
Didn't he tell you?

570
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,360
Now

571
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
-No, Cliff never mentioned it.

572
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,020
CLIFF: What didn't I mention?

573
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,930
-That you hired a photographer.

574
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,430
-I never hired a photographer.

575
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,180
-I guess you must have
 been looking for a man.

576
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,460
-Always.

577
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,320
MEL: But when you hired
 Mel Stevens, that's me.

578
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,450
We should have spoken sooner
 on the phone or something.

579
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,540
But, um, anyways, it's a
 pleasure to be working for you,

580
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,000
Mr. Barker.

581
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,470
-I don't think
 you realize that--

582
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,650
-Cliff, this is the
 photographer you hired.

583
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,090
Believe me, you want her
 to be your photographer.

584
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,320
-Uh, you know, babe?

585
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,070
I never discussed the
 exact terms with Mel.

586
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,490
And, uh, I didn't want
 to bore you with all the,

587
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,590
um-- hey, have you
 shown Libby your dress?

588
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,290
-Yeah.

589
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,720
Well, she started to, but then--

590
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,350
-Oh, well you really
 got to see it.

591
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,390
I mean, it is just gorgeous.

592
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,090
Yeah.

593
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,730
CORY: OK, let's let them
 handle the photographer.

594
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,420
-Bye.

595
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,770
-Can't miss this.

596
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,620
-All right, what
 is the game, Jake?

597
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,590
-Listen, I could have been
 on a train and out of here.

598
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,650
I'm doing you guys a favor.

599
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,380
-Makes us even.

600
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,350
-Nobody asked you to--

601
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,700
-All right, can we stick with
 the matter at hand, please?

602
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,550
What is with Miss Shutterbug?

603
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,900
-It's Mel Stevens.

604
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,910
And it would be an
 honor to photograph

605
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,650
your wedding, Mr. Barker.

606
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,400
-Where would these
 photos end up?

607
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,070
-It's not a matter of where
 those photos end up as

608
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,630
much as it is a matter of
 where these photos end up.

609
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,290
See, Mel here is not only
 an attractive and skilled

610
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,000
photographer.

611
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,110
She-- she's also an accomplished
 climber under roofs,

612
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,710
like the one outside
 the upstairs bedroom.

613
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,600
-What exactly did you
 see from that roof, Mel?

614
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,140
-You're both very impressive.

615
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,120
-You sneaky little bitch.

616
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,980
-Oh, so the tabloids
 can run an assault

617
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,350
story as well as a gay story?

618
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,340
-Typical breeder move.

619
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,560
-So despite what
 you guys think, I'm

620
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,600
not just some ruthless bitch.

621
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
-Nobody said you're ruthless.

622
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,170
-Much more likely
 ruthful than ruthless,

623
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,270
wouldn't you say, Jacob?

624
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,970
JAKE: I don't know.

625
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,950
I think she could be ruthless.

626
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,830
-No, no, no.

627
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,240
But I don't want to be ruthless.

628
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,220
I mean, look, I can make 10
 times as much for these photos

629
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,440
as I could for any wedding
 spread in a magazine.

630
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,070
But at least it would
 be a good paycheck

631
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,270
and a start on a
 respectable new career.

632
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,700
-And it's exactly what you want.

633
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't you see, Cliff?

634
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,930
You get a gorgeous spread of you
 in all your heterosexual glory.

635
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,570
-Heterosexual glory, hallelujah.

636
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,950
-Plus, you'll get a
 great wedding album.

637
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,670
Your bride will love it.

638
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,650
-All right, so you
 shoot the wedding.

639
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,790
Cory gets an album, and then
 you get a sale to a magazine.

640
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,310
And you get this little roll of
 film right after the wedding.

641
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,360
-See?

642
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,800
Everybody wins.

643
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,460
-Everybody wins.

644
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,960
MEL: You're not staying
 for the wedding?

645
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,310
-No, I don't think that
 would be an intelligent move.

646
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,010
-Why not?

647
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,120
-Well--

648
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,880
-Why were you on that roof?

649
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,070
-Oh, the, um--
 well, Liberty, she--

650
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,580
she had a misunderstanding
 which led her to--

651
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,080
in a way that really wasn't
 conduc-- conducive to--

652
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,740
and, um-- well, I figured
 given the circumstances,

653
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,580
I saw an opportunity.

654
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,860
The roof.

655
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,880
I figured, um-- well,
 that's where I met you.

656
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,710
Lucky for everyone.

657
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,790
-Certainly lucky for me.

658
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,270
So, um, you have to
 leave right away?

659
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,400
-Yeah, I've got to
 make a train at 5:00.

660
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,340
-Oh, I won't be needing
 much help past then, anyway.

661
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,040
-Help?

662
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,740
Help?

663
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,820
Help?

664
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,140
-Yeah, help.

665
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,020
Help.

666
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,600
I mean, lugging
 this stuff in for me

667
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,540
was really nice and
 helpful and all that.

668
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,060
But I wasn't exactly planning
 on shooting a wedding today.

669
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,230
I mean, it's kind
 of hard to do all

670
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,050
by yourself at the
 last minute, you know?

671
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,480
-Would I really be a help?

672
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,420
-Sure.

673
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,870
-I guess I did
 get you into this.

674
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,570
-You did.

675
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,650
-My god, look at my hair.

676
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,350
-I know.

677
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,950
Look how long mine was.

678
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,120
Remember how my dad would
 never let me cut it?

679
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,260
-Only half an inch.

680
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,530
God, you sure haven't
 changed much in this room.

681
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,330
-Well, I'm hardly ever here.

682
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,800
And you know my mom likes
 to pretend I'm still 18.

683
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,840
-Yeah, so she can
 pretend she's still 40.

684
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,470
Well, I bet this is one thing
 Cliff wish you would change.

685
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,010
CORY: Oh, we sleep fine there.

686
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,050
-For sleep, yeah.

687
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,620
But--

688
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,080
-Actually, we haven't done it.

689
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,100
-Yeah, well, here.

690
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,780
Your mom's house right
 before the wedding.

691
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,720
I guess it would be
 kind of romantic to hold

692
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,950
off till the wedding night.

693
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,650
-No.

694
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,110
I mean, we haven't done it ever.

695
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,210
-Ever?

696
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,910
-It's just, you know, with
 all that's been going on.

697
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,470
-Cory, that's what's
 supposed to be going on.

698
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,110
When I date a guy, we do
 it a few times a week.

699
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,070
Sometimes a day.

700
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,260
Hell, Jake and I even had
 a double over the weekend

701
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,000
and he's gay.

702
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,490
I wonder how that works.

703
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,340
He's got to be bi, you think?

704
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,810
CORY: Yeah.

705
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,090
Here it is.

706
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,580
-Oh, it's beautiful.

707
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,870
Cliff's going to love it.

708
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,650
-You want to help me?

709
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,730
-Sure.

710
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,740
-What are you doing?

711
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,760
The dress is great.

712
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,910
You're going to look
 beautiful, radiant, the works.

713
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,880
We got to figure out what
 you're going to wear tonight.

714
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,310
-But the photographer--

715
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,220
-[INAUDIBLE].

716
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,620
Let me see.

717
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,470
Well, it's kind of
 sexy, but very basic.

718
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,260
So-- you have any teddies?

719
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
-That isn't what
 you meant, is it?

720
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,340
-You don't have any teddies?

721
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,040
Well, how about
 a sexy nightgown?

722
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,180
-Not really.

723
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,180
-Come on, you've got to give
 me something to work with here.

724
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,510
-Wait, I do have this.

725
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,770
-Uh, that could work
 for Carol Brady.

726
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,970
-I'm sorry, Lib.

727
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,650
I've just never given much
 importance to this stuff.

728
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,100
-And you're the one
 marrying Cliff Barker

729
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,450
and I'm being dumped
 by yet another guy.

730
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,850
-Jake didn't dump you.

731
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,910
He just realized he had to
 be honest about who he is.

732
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,900
-It's a dump.

733
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,740
They're all dumps.

734
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,640
Jake comes out of the closet.

735
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,520
Steve has to relocate.

736
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,970
Jeff feels inferior.

737
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,200
It's me, right?

738
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,040
I'd like to think it's them,
 but-- I do the aerobics.

739
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,380
I learned how to cook.

740
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,410
Shouldn't things be better?

741
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,620
-They will be, Lib.

742
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,030
-It's just the
 pressure, you know?

743
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,500
Everybody expects my
 life to be perfect.

744
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,940
I've got looks, a career.

745
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,740
I went to this
 self-help weekend once.

746
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,280
And when I stood up to tell my
 problems, they sent me home.

747
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,290
Refund and everything because
 I didn't have any problems.

748
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,010
My mom, my relatives,
 they don't fix

749
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,270
me up with a nice,
 single doctor.

750
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,070
No, Liberty's focusing
 on her career.

751
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,720
She'd be married if
 she wanted to be.

752
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,530
Yeah, like I just
 snap my fingers

753
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,790
and anything I want comes to me.

754
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,210
-Did you really want Jake?

755
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,170
-No.

756
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,050
I don't think so.

757
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:33,610
I just wanted to bring a
 boyfriend to your wedding.

758
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,940
Some maid of honor I am.

759
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,720
-No, no.

760
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,030
It's OK.

761
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,060
I mean, this wedding isn't
 one of those big affairs.

762
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,680
We can plus one it till next
 week when you feel better.

763
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,340
You would do that for me?

764
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,630
-Yeah.

765
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,670
-Cory.

766
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,910
You're the most wonderful friend
 and the most stupid bride.

767
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,730
You're getting married today.

768
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,760
And I'm the happiest person
 in the whole world for you.

769
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,250
-All we need are the people.

770
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:11,950
-Cool.

771
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,190
Oh, well, I'll go get them.

772
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,900
Photographer's ready.

773
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,840
If you're dressed, you
 can just head on down.

774
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,660
Everything's set.

775
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,620
Just come on down
 if you're ready.

776
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,320
Hello?

777
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,750
Mrs. Lindross?

778
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,130
RITA: It's Rita, Jake.

779
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,310
You know that.

780
00:34:53,310 --> 00:35:00,360
-It's, um-- Rita,
 the, uh, camera.

781
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,760
Downstairs.

782
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,140
Woman.

783
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,500
Mel.

784
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,190
RITA: The photographer?

785
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,940
-The photographer, right.

786
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,550
She's, um-- she's ready
 to start taking pictures.

787
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,240
But I think she's going
 to want you clothed.

788
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,720
RITA: And how would you want me?

789
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,370
-Want you?

790
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,860
Want you!

791
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,380
Um, I'm just-- I'm going
 to check on the others.

792
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,380
[KNOCKING]

793
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,470
-Who is it?

794
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,230
JAKE: Jake.

795
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,930
-Oh.

796
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,460
-The photographer is-- what?

797
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,210
-That's the man who
 can do us some good.

798
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,680
We need your opinion
 on what looks sexy.

799
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,380
-Me?

800
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,130
But I'm, uh--

801
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,110
-Gay, yeah.

802
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,340
We've heard.

803
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,330
Are you sure you're not bi?

804
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,300
-No, I'm straight.

805
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,060
Gay.

806
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,660
Straight gay down the line.

807
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,340
-Well, you guys know better
 than anyone what looks good.

808
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,000
Will that get Cliff's attention
 on their wedding night?

809
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,390
-Yeah, I would-- I guess a
 straight guy would, um-- there.

810
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,070
It's lovely.

811
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,960
-Well, how about this one?

812
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,770
Oh, don't worry about him,
 just one of the girls.

813
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,190
-Is this one better?

814
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,830
-No, I'd go with the first.

815
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,230
You really ought to
 get into your dresses.

816
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,580
There's only so much
 time for photographs

817
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,480
before the guests
 start to arrive.

818
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,820
I'll just tell the photographer
 you'll be a few minutes.

819
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,110
-Oh.

820
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:45,810
-Ooh.

821
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,830
There certainly are a lot
 of doors to these rooms.

822
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:22,050
-Yes, there are.

823
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,750
-But that's-- that's
 a lovely ensemble.

824
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,540
-Well, thank you, Jake.

825
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,810
Um, so the
 photographer is ready?

826
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,290
-Yes, yes, yes.

827
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,140
She's all set.

828
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,120
-Well then.

829
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,130
-Oh.

830
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,330
Ah!

831
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,700
-Oh, Jake.

832
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,940
You're happy to see me.

833
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,800
I can feel it.

834
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,830
You know, that's an
 involuntary muscle.

835
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,930
You can't tell it what to do.

836
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:18,780
It has it's own, uh,
 inner course of action.

837
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,290
You know, um-- if an older
 woman like me supposedly

838
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,520
past her prime can get a
 reaction like that, then

839
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,870
a young girl like Liberty.

840
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,280
-Rita, you are not
 past your prime.

841
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,510
You are an attractive,
 vibrant woman.

842
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,810
-You really think so, Jake?

843
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,510
-Yeah.

[KNOCKING]

845
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,090
LIBERTY: Mrs. Lind-- uh, Rita?

846
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,560
It's Liberty.

847
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,550
-This doesn't look good.

848
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,250
-No.

849
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:51,860
No, no.

850
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,560
No, it doesn't.

851
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,270
-I was just wondering--
 I hate to bother you,

852
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,880
but, um, I thought
 that maybe-- see,

853
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,420
it's about what
 Cory's going to wear.

854
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,680
-Uh-huh.

855
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,350
A problem with the dress?

856
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,050
-Uh, no, no, no.

857
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,710
The dress is fine.

858
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,690
It's just, you know, what
 she's going to wear tonight.

859
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,340
Because it's her and
 Cliff's first night.

860
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,820
I thought that
 maybe you might have

861
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,620
something that she could borrow?

862
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,440
-Um, you mean, something more--

863
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,590
-Yeah, you know, kind of--

864
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,370
-Me?

865
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,070
-Yes, you.

866
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,570
-Possibly.

867
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,140
-Well, can we take a look?

868
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,980
-Um, yeah.

869
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,410
Go ahead, honey.

870
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,300
Um, have a look for yourself.

871
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,970
-No, I really-- I don't
 want to disturb you.

872
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,710
-No, go ahead, disturb.

873
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,500
-No, really.

874
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,230
I wouldn't feel right.

875
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,930
-All right.

876
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,390
I'll look, but you
 stay right here.

00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,520
-Dammit, why did you have
 to come out of the closet?

878
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,990
RITA: Any particular color?

879
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,070
-Oh, well, red is usually good.

880
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,040
-Uh, scarlet or crimson, honey?

881
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,840
-Uh, scarlet.

882
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,060
-Rose or cherry?

883
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,440
-Uh, cherry, I guess,
 if you have it.

00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,340
Oh.

-Oh, excuse me, honey.

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,730

-Whoa.

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,640
-Sorry.

890
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,350
-Oh.

891
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,050
-Ah.

892
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,040
-Ooh.

893
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,780
-Oh my god.

894
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,010
I am so sorry.

895
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,630
I was just-- oh, god.

896
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,560
[INAUDIBLE]

897
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,530
Oh, god.

898
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:55,010
I should have been--
 I, I, I-- they

899
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,380
weren't ready and I
 was trying to, um--

900
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,170
-Thanks.

901
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,220
-For?

902
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,920
-Everything.

903
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,090
-I never checked
 on Wes and Cliff.

904
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,920
-Hey.

905
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,780
OK, so, um, put your
 hands in your pockets.

906
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,480
Good.

907
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Not that far down your pockets.

908
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,140
Come on.

909
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,780
-Well, you know, since
 they're in the neighborhood.

910
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,890
-OK, I need you guys to
 turn a little to the right.

911
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,980
The other right.

912
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,400
I want to do profile shots, OK?

913
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,330
-Good.

914
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,650
Good.

915
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,350
Jake, you know what?

916
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:46,270
Can you move that reflector
 a little more to the left,

917
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:46,960
please?

918
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:51,920
Perfect.

919
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,400
-We're over here.

920
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,580
-[CLEARS THROAT].

921
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,180
-Ne'er have I seen true
 beauty till this night.

922
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,630
-Wes, you don't have to
 stand quite that close.

923
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,780
-Just showing that the
 groom's got my full support.

924
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,480
-All right.

925
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,230
All right, all right.

926
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,930
That's it.

927
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,600
I think they got enough
 pictures of the two of us.

928
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,690
Cory, that wasn't anything.

929
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,690
We were just like--

930
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,530
-No, I think it's sweet
 the way you guys play.

931
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,260
I mean, I was a little worried
 from this morning, but--

932
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,240
-We have a very
 strong friendship.

933
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,530
And I don't intend to let this
 marriage damage it one bit.

934
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,600
-Thank god.

935
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,980
I want us all to
 be friends, too.

936
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,360
-OK, this is all very
 wonderful, but, uh, we

937
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,780
have a lot to do before
 the guests arrive.

938
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,340
So Cory, come with me.

939
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,900
Stand by the [INAUDIBLE] thingy.

940
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,050
And Cliff, next to her.

941
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,090
Come on.

942
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,400
And you, I'm sorry?

943
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,100
-Liberty.

944
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,120
-Liberty, next the Cory.

945
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,820
Good.

946
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,230
-Is your mom ready yet, Cory?

947
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,330
-Oh, uh, she'll be
 down in a minute.

948
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,570
-New career in photography?

949
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,220
There's just no
 end to what we've

950
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,060
learned about you this weekend.

951
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,070
-And Wes, you stand over--
 I think that's close enough.

952
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,970
OK, smile.

953
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

954
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,870
-Wow, that-- that
 seemed to go well.

955
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,340
-Yeah, you make a
 great assistant.

956
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,800
-You make a lousy liar.

957
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
I'm going to go
 in and call a cab.

958
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,930
I'll be back in a minute.

959
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:00,630
-Great.

960
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,060
I'll be here.

961
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,230
-Where'd you get that
 photographer from?

962
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,760
-Uh, she was, um--
 well, we were a little

963
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,940
short on time and stuff.

964
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,710
So, uh--

965
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,560
-Through the mail.

966
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,700
-The mail?

967
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,580
-Yes, pretty much
 through blackmail--

968
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,110
-An ad in the mail.

969
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,500
Huh.

970
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,220
Out of the blue.

971
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,230
Just kind of had a
 good feeling about her.

972
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,080
-I don't think she
 knows what she's doing.

973
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,700
I mean, what's with Mr. Sock?

974
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,370
And Jake just distracts her.

975
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,680
I hope she gets a couple
 more good shots of Cory.

976
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,370
Do you think you guys could keep
 Jake busy for a little while?

977
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,300
-Hi, I need a cab?

978
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,100
Oh, uh, I'd say 4:40.

979
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,630
It's only a five-minute
 ride from the [INAUDIBLE]

980
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,370
Station to the train
 station, right?

981
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,070
OK.

982
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:56,870
Well then, yeah, my
 train is at 5:00.

983
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,260
Yeah, 4:40 would be great.

984
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,410
OK, so I'll see you in front
 of-- um, oh, uh, 81 Keaton

985
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,940
Lane-- uh, Drive.

986
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,380
Road.

987
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,330
Thank you, of course, road.

988
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:11,030
Uh, all right.

989
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,810
So 4:40 in front.

990
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,510
Thanks a lot.

991
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,200
Bye.

992
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,900
Oh.

993
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,240
-Plotting your
 final escape, Jake?

994
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,940
-Uh.

995
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,580
-I can't say we'll
 miss you, Jake.

996
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,830
But you made it interesting.

997
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:21,190
-Likewise.

998
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,890
You guys are done.

999
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,870
So is-- is Mel-- Mel's
 outside shooting the girls.

1000
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:25,570
-Great.

1001
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:26,640
Well, I just need to--

1002
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,620
-Haven't you broken
 enough hearts today?

1003
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,630
Let her do her job.

1004
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,850
-Cory's supposed to get
 an album out of this deal.

1005
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,550
Remember, Jake?

1006
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,250
-Right.

1007
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,710
Well, I need-- I
 need to help her.

1008
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,250
-She'll manage.

1009
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,170
What do you say we help
 you get your things

1010
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,600
ready for the train, Jake?

1011
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,670
-My things?

1012
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,560
I've got a [INAUDIBLE].

1013
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,330
It's like this big.

1014
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,030
-Yeah.

1015
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,730
Well, you know what?

1016
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,530
I need something to help
 keep me busy right now.

1017
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,690
-And Jake can tell us all
 about sneaker infrastructure.

1018
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,330
He's an expert in the field.

1019
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,030
-Really?

1020
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:56,730
-Yeah.

1021
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,980
OK, look at his
 shoes, for example.

1022
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:58,350
The laces?

1023
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:58,640
-Right.

1024
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,680
-Totally redundant.

1025
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,600
-Redundant?

1026
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,590
JAKE: You could be just as
 comfortable without laces.

1027
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,210
CLIFF: What do you
 mean redundant laces?

1028
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,640
JAKE: Redundant because the
 laces are just there to keep

1029
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,770
the thing-- if you
 took them off--

1030
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,100
-OK, just one more.

1031
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,800
Smile.

1032
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,670
OK, we're done.

1033
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,350
So I'm going to take lots of
 candids when the guests arrive.

1034
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:17,490
Of course I'll
 shoot the ceremony,

1035
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,680
but that's enough with
 the posed shots for now.

1036
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,030
-Oh, thank you so much.

1037
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,790
I'm really looking forward
 to seeing your work.

1038
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,490
-Thanks.

1039
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,200
Thanks for the
 vote of confidence.

1040
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,870
You'll get to see everything
 after your honeymoon.

1041
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,410
-Oh, great.

1042
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,530
-Now, did you get a
 lot of my daughter

1043
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:32,260
without anybody else around?

1044
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,100
All alone?

1045
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,130
-Oh, yeah, I got tons of
 them before you came down.

1046
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,100
-Good.

1047
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,660
Now when the guests
 arrive, they'll

1048
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,620
be a pretty lady,
 tall, attractive.

1049
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,950
Uh, that's my sister Julie.

1050
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:46,100
And she'll be with her husband,
 also tall, very charismatic.

1051
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,400
You'll want to take lots
 of pictures of them.

1052
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,580
-Sounds like they'd be easy to--

1053
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,280
-Don't.

1054
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,690
-Don't?

1055
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,270
-Don't.

1056
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,970
-Done.

1057
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,470
-Oh, uh, why aren't you dressed?

1058
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,630
The guests will be
 arriving any minute.

1059
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,760
-I-- I can't stay, Rita.

1060
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,960
It wouldn't be right.

1061
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,090
-Oh, nonsense.

1062
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,370
Everybody wants you to stay.

1063
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,200
Especially Liberty.

1064
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,820
I'll go talk to her.

1065
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,220
Now, don't you go anywhere.

1066
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,370
-I'm sorry I took so long.

1067
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,490
After my phone call, the
 guys took me upstairs.

1068
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,550
-No, it's OK, really.

1069
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:26,620
The rest of the shoot went fine.

1070
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,320
-Good.

1071
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:36,130
Um, I do have to leave soon,
 but I really want us to--

1072
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,540
-Well, it was a
 pleasure meeting you

1073
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,220
and, uh, thanks
 for all your help.

1074
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,920
-OK.

1075
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,410
Did I do something?

1076
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,110
-No.

1077
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:02,570
No, you know what?

1078
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,090
It's my fault.

1079
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:04,790
I just pushed.

1080
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,020
And from the way
 you acted, I just--

1081
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,880
I must have misread the
 signs and didn't realize.

1082
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,790
-That?

1083
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,990
-That you're gay.

1084
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,760
-Oh, that.

1085
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,510
The girls told you?

1086
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,210
-Yeah.

1087
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,330
Libby, actually.

1088
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,330
I mean, I guess I should have
 known from the roof, you know?

1089
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,120
But hey, I just thought
 you were joking.

1090
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,890
I wasn't exactly
 concentrating given the fact

1091
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,350
that I was hanging
 from my fingertips.

1092
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,470
But I just thought
 the way we were--

1093
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,420
you know, that we
 sort of had something.

1094
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,220
And I don't know.

1095
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,180
I tend to be a romantic and-- I
 guess it's no excuse for just--

1096
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,950
-Mel.

1097
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,540
-You got me this great
 job and everything.

1098
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,890
And I was just hoping that
 you felt about me the way--

1099
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:40,590
JAKE: Mel.

1100
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:41,460

1101
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,070
Listen to me, I'm not gay.

1102
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:52,220
By choice.

1103
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,770
It's-- it's just
 the way that I am.

1104
00:50:54,770 --> 00:51:00,340
It's nothing personal about--
 you see, you're really-- oh,

1105
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,040
the hell with this.

1106
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,960
Listen, just stay here.

1107
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,710
I've got to go
 straighten myself out.

1108
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,790
-They wanted a little privacy.

1109
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,860
LIBERTY: I didn't drag you here.

1110
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,210
You could have said no.

1111
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,030
JAKE: H, great.

1112
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,860
You could have beaten me in
 the office instead of here.

1113
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,850
It was Wes' idea, anyway.

1114
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:33,550
LIBERTY: Yeah.

1115
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,680
Well, what about you
 under the covers?

1116
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,600
JAKE: That wasn't me.

1117
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,900
I mean, that wasn't me the
 way that you think it was.

1118

LIBERTY: Oh, and I suppose--

1119
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,410
JAKE: Look, Libby, I
 am sorry for the lies.

1120
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,680
But I swear to god I'm
 telling you the truth now.

1121
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,880
I am not gay.

-Me?

She's passed out.

1133
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,000
She could really be hurt.

00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,200
-She'll be OK.

1135
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,760
She's just stunned.

 happened to the photographer?

1137
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,440
-Liberty slugged her.

 weren't flattering.

-No, you don't understand.

I was trying to hit Jake.

00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,360
-Oh.

1144
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,510
Why?

1145
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:39,650
-Because he's not gay.

 might become confused.

00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,690

00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,030
-Yeah.

1244
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,010
You know Libby.

1245
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,100
Um, when I told her
 I wasn't gay, she--

1246
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,040
-Oh, fabulous day.

1247
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,780
See?

1248
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,790
I told you it was a dump.

1249
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,210
I need a drink.

1250
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:44,180
-Oh, with the
 ceremony in an hour?

1251
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,920
-You're right, but
 I am really tense.

1252
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,310
-Well, we still have the sauna.

1253
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,150
-Do I have time?

1254
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,060
-Yeah, I think so.

1255
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,820
Come on.

1256
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,010
-This is not an act.

1257
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,380
I care about Cory.

1258
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,310
-You should.

1259
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,840
She's a terrific girl.

1260
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,040
And that's coming
 from someone who's

1261
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,390
not overly fond of the species.

1262
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,120
She deserves better than
 the lies you're giving her.

1263
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,800
-Well, I'll make her happy.

1264
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,730
-You can't.

1265
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:07,850
Not for long.

1266
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,850
You're the one always
 quoting Shakespeare.

1267
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,920
Think of the line from "Hamlet."

1268
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,070
-What, to be-- what, you
 think I should kill myself?

1269
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:16,900
-No.

1270
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,660
"To thine own self be true."

1271
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,350
-Oh, that one.

1272
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,430
Well, what do you want me to do?

1273
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,340
Call off the wedding?

1274
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:27,140
The guests are going to
 be here in about an hour.

1275
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,170
-A few aunts,
 uncles, and a judge.

1276
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:29,960
They'll get over it.

1277
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,860
-What about Cory?

1278
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,140
-What about that
 photographer with that film?

1279
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,620
If she doesn't have a wedding
 spread to sell the magazine--

1280
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,320
Wait a minute.

1281
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,020
Is that?

1282
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,780
-Mm-hmm.

1283
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,330
-How did you get that?

1284
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,850
-Just reached down and took it.

1285
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:43,550
-When she was out?

1286
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,680
-Mm-hmm.

1287
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,380
-Oh.

1288
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,930
Sometimes you can be so--

1289
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,070
-It's not like I enjoyed it.

1290
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,170
I did it for you.

1291
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,490
For us.

1292
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,420
You don't have to marry her now.

1293
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,990
-Wes, I am not the first
 gay guy to get married.

1294
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,690
OK?

1295
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,070
People do it all the time.

1296
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:08,410
Besides, you knew from day one
 that this was a possibility.

1297
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,580
I'm marrying Cory.

1298
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,620
It's what I got to do.

1299
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,460
-To hell with everyone else.

1300
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,920
No.

1301
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,480
I don't think so.

1302
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,330
-Are you sure you
 should be doing this?

1303
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,250
-No.

1304
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,010
-No?

1305
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,780
-No, but you know what?

1306
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,720
I've gotten so many color
 pictures already that I just--

1307
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,420
-No, no.

1308
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,730
I mean, you just
 had a concussion.

1309
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,090
-A concussion?

1310
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:39,960
-Yeah.

1311
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,120
-Nah, it's just a
 little bump on the chin.

1312
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,970
I'll be fine, really.

1313
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:44,750
All I need to do is--

1314
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,450
-Whoa, Mel.

1315
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,290
-How's that for a
 smooth move, huh?

1316
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,480
-You are destabilizing.

1317
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,250
-Hm, I think I like that.

1318
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,510
-God, my cab is going
 to be here in a minute.

1319
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,470
-Do you really have to go?

1320
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:05,180
-Yeah.

1321
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:09,010
I have a meeting with,
 um-- it's about sneakers

1322
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:12,990
and a new concept
 in infrastructure.

1323
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,110
Boy, I really can't
 explain this now.

1324
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,040
It's-- it's big.

1325
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,180
-Then, you go.

1326
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:19,880
Come on.

1327
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,080
-You can shoot the
 rest on your own?

1328
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,210
-I could have shot the
 whole thing on my own,

1329
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,710
but it was a lot more
 fun having you help.

1330
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:30,470
-Really?

1331
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,650
-Yeah.

1332
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,520
-You sure you feel OK?

1333
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,390
-I'm fine.

1334
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,130
I feel fine.

1335
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,080
I'm all set up to shoot
 the rest of the ceremony,

1336
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,830
and I've still got this
 wicked little roll of film,

1337
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,830
not that I need-- it's not here.

1338
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,420
-Are you sure?

1339
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,200
-Sure, I'm sure.

1340
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,970
-Well, did you lose it?

1341
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:50,720
-There's not that
 much room in here.

1342
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,090
-Then?

1343
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,280
-Somebody took it.

1344
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,050
Bug.

1345
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:07,750
Big bug.

1346
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,540
-Yes, I'm familiar with them.

1347
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,210
-Listen, gay or not,
 you had no business

1348
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,860
sticking your hand down there.

1349
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,900
-Down where?

1350
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,740
-I was going to give you guys
 the roll of film, anyway.

1351
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,660
Come on, I know you now.

1352
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,040
I wouldn't blackmail you.

1353
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,730
-Well, we couldn't
 take the chance.

1354
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,710
And I apologize
 for the intrusion.

1355
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,360
-Uh, don't worry about it.

1356
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,250
So, um, what'd you do
 with the film anyway?

1357
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,560
-Gave it to Cliff.

1358
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,590
-He's going to
 destroy it, isn't he?

1359
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,830
-Well, there are a
 few shots I'd hope

1360
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,420
he blow up for enlargements.

1361
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,890
But no accounting for
 his tastes these days.

1362
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:34,590
-Dammit.

1363
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,690
It was some of my
 best work, too.

1364
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,920
[HONKING]

1365
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,040
-Oh, that's my cab.

1366
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,710
-Come on, I guess
 I'll walk you out.

1367
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,520
-It's been memorable.

1368
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,000
-It certainly has, Jacob.

1369
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,630
-Hey, what you got there?

1370
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,320
-Uh, it was just-- the rings.

1371
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,730
-Can I see them?

1372
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,850
Please, please, please?

1373
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,140
-Well, we really shouldn't.

1374
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,410
-Oh, come on.
 I've been dying to see them.

1375
01:00:59,410 --> 01:00:59,960
-I've got a cab to catch.

1376
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,290
Would you show her--
 it's not the rings.

1377
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,210
It's just an envelope.

1378
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,420
What's this bumpy thing?

1379
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,450
-It's personal.

1380
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,200
And I think I just have enough
 time before the ceremony

1381
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,310
to mail it in the
 box on the road.

1382
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,360
Have a nice life, Jake.

1383
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,130
-What's he mailing to
 "The National Enquirer?"

1384
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,060
-Oh my god, it's my film.

1385
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,480
Come back here, Wes.

1386
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,430
You can't do that.

1387
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,800
I made a deal with Cliff.

1388
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,500
-But I didn't.

1389
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,220
JAKE: Oh, come on, Wes.

1390
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,390
That's-- Whoa.

1391
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,090
Ow.

1392
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,180
-No, no, no.

1393
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,120
You've got a train to catch.

1394
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,380
-But the-- the film?

1395
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,080
-That's my problem.

1396
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,600
You've done enough already.

1397
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,560
Call me.

1398
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,430
-Excuse me.

1399
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,270
-Is there a problem?

1400
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,970
-Uh, no.

1401
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,650
I just, um, need some air.

1402
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,270
-Oh, good.

1403
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:08,800
Gorgeous out there, isn't it?

1404
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,070
You always have to
 be so careful when

1405
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,930
you're planning
 an outdoor event.

1406
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:15,740
But I think we got
 lucky, don't you?

1407
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:19,540
-Yes, it's lovely.

1408
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,680
-Oh, you're looking much better.

1409
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,170
You know, you gave
 us quite a scare.

1410
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:23,870
-Oh, yeah.

1411
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:24,570
I'm fine now.

1412
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,770
-Good, because I was
 wondering, maybe you

1413
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,760
could take some pictures of
 me with my daughter outside

1414
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,460
in the backyard?

1415
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,550
-Oh, fine idea.

1416
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:31,350
I'll go check the light.

1417
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,050
-Good.

1418
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:32,790
I'll go get Cory.

1419
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,490
-Great.

1420
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:03,770
-Whoa.

1421
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:04,470
Whoa.

1422
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,760
[INAUDIBLE] OK?

1423
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,740
-Hey.

1424
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:20,690
WES: Finders keepers,
 losers weepers.

1425
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,230
Hey, Jake.

1426
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:37,750
You got a damsel
 in distress there.

1427
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,010
You're going to miss
 your train, buddy.

1428
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,710
Come on.

1429
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,250
I thought you were catching the
 5 o'clock train out of town.

1430
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,700
-I was.

1431
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,950
That's why I'm going
 to kill you now.

1432
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,660
-You can have the
 ceremony here if you like.

1433
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,100
But I was just
 wondering-- honey,

1434
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,290
maybe you should consider
 having it over there.

1435
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:36,820
I mean, it would be so lovely
 with the sunset behind you.

1436
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,140
What do you think?

1437
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,400
-Well, if you want it
 over there, that's--

1438
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,290
-Oh, no, honey,
 it's what you want.

1439
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:43,990
-Where's Mel?

[FLY BUZZING]

1441
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,200
-It's not that.

1442
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,810
-Well then, what is it, honey?

1443
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,610
-I don't know.

1444
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,400
It's-- it's the mood.

1445
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,610
There's been so
 much tension today.

1446
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,400
The fight.

1447
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,840
-Honey, everything's just fine.

1448
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,270
You're dealing with
 some very volatile

1449
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,720
personalities, that's all.

1450
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,660
I mean, you know how Liberty is.

1451
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:27,970
And Cliff's an actor.

1452
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:31,730
They're very emotional people.

1453
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:35,210
-He just hasn't seemed at
 ease since Wes arrived.

1454
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,240
-Well, honey, Wes
 is his best friend

1455
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,620
and he doesn't have
 any real family.

1456
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:41,950
He's probably nervous
 about what Wes thinks.

1457
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:42,650
-Maybe.

1458
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,600
But sometimes I think--

1459
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,650
-Careful!

1460
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,690
You'll get your dress dirty.

1461
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:09,490
Oh, honey, everybody's
 feeling fine.

1462
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,750
I mean, now that everything's
 straightened out with Jake,

1463
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:16,530
and the photographer's
 conscious.

1464
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:20,960
Everybody's going to be a
 lot more relaxed and at ease.

1465
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,750
Or maybe not.

-Men, even at weddings they're
 still such little boys.

1468
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:48,370
I'll just go get my camera.

1469
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:51,340
-You do that.

1470
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,210
-Cory, I'm going to take
 a sauna like you said.

1471
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,050
But I promise, I'll be
 showered and dressed

1472
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,610
before the guests arrive.

1473
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,300
-Good.

1474
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,780
-I'm so sorry you
 missed your train.

1475
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,740
-Oh.

1476
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,020
So am I. I couldn't let your
 photos get used that way.

1477
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:33,890
-Thanks.

1478
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:34,780
Listen, you know what?

1479
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,150
They're waiting for
 me out back, so could

1480
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:37,250
you give this to Cliff for me?
 -Sure.

Grab him!

01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,020
He stole the film.

1485
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:55,720
Grab him.

01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,060

-No.

Cliff, we were [INAUDIBLE].

1491
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:03,240
-I, I tried to get
 it back myself.

1492
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,010
I didn't want to upset you
 right before the ceremony.

1493
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:05,710
-Thanks.

1494
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:06,890
That's was very
 thoughtful of you.

-You shut up.

1498
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:10,840
You just shut up.

1499
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,670
-Give me the film.

1500
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,760
I'll put it somewhere safe.

1501
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,460

 are as dumb as people say.

 be your best man.

 going to be fine.

 married no matter what.

-But-- come on, I want to
 find out what's going on.

-No.

-This way, it's faster
 through the house.

-Cliff, he's out in front.

1584
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,380
And I'm on the roof.

01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,500

 for a soft landing.

-I am.

-Not another step, or
 the mailbox gets it.

-Wes, don't do this to me.

 everything you're doing

01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,530
-It's a terrible thing
 you'd be doing, Wes.

1596
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:06,790
-Oh, really, a terrible thing?

1597
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,930
What do you think, Jake?

1598
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:11,770
You must have a thought
 on what I a villain I am.

1599
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,890
You, who dropped his
 girlfriend on the spot

1600
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,470
when it meant getting to a
 business meeting on time.

1601
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,720
And Miss Photographer
 who took these pictures

1602
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,240
and planned on doing just what
 I am, but simply for money.

1603
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,120
And you, my love, would marry a
 sweet young girl whom you can't

1604
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,650
possibly give the
 love she deserves.

1605
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,210
Yes, you three are
 standing here telling

1606
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:36,100
me what an evil thing I'm doing.

1607
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,110
I'm the only one doing
 the honest thing.

1608
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:41,360
I'm the only one doing
 what I really believe in.

1609
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,700
And it's not for my career.

1610
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,640
It's for love.

1611
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,800
LIBERTY: Please don't.

1612
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,890
I don't know what
 that is, but it's

1613
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,370
obviously going to hurt Cliff.

1614
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:59,440
And I don't want him
 hurt anymore today.

1615
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,350
-Anymore?

1616
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:04,690
-Cliff, I can't marry you.

1617
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:05,500
-Are you--

1618
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,200
-No, no.

1619
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,700
It's all been too fast.

1620
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,240
You're a great guy,
 and I got all caught up

1621
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,670
in the wedding thing,
 but I'm not ready.

1622
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,740
We're not ready.

1623
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,240
I know.

1624
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,740
-You know?

1625
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,600
-I know.

1626
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,600
-Does Cliff know you know?

1627
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,290
-No.

1628
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,340
And I don't want him to know.

1629
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:50,830
-No?

1630
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,530
-No.

1631
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,550
RITA: Are you OK?

1632
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:15,970
-I'm fine.

1633
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:16,790
How about you?

1634
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:21,830
-I'm a little disappointed and
 a complete mess, but I'm fine.

1635
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:23,620
Everything's going
 to be just fine.

1636
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,790
-Here you go, Jacob.

1637
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:32,780
You wanted it so badly.

1638
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,430
-Well, it doesn't
 look like she'll

1639
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:43,600
be selling any big
 wedding spread.

1640
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,250
-And I don't need to.

1641
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:04,580
So, what time did you say
 that meeting of yours was?

1642
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:06,120
-9:00.

1643
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:12,190
-Well, I do have a car and
 nothing to keep me here.

1644
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:17,080
-It's over 200-- if
 we drove [INAUDIBLE]

1645
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,060
we just might make it.

1646
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:21,830
-We just might.

1647
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,530
-Come on.

1648
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,440
-Jake.

1649
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,060
Jeff, you just missed him.

1650
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,880
No, I have no idea
 where he went.

1651
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:43,080
Yeah, I guess I
 could take a message.

1652
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,330
Tonight's meeting is cancelled.

1653
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,210
What meeting?

1654
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:52,700
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1655
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:17,660
WES: Now, where
 could that have-- ah.

1656
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:21,330
Never know when this
 might come in handy.
