1
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,100
What's going on?

2
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:40,641
Let's go to the city.

3
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,350
Let's go to the movies.

4
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,224
But if you don't like movies.

5
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,141
We haven't been to the movies since

6
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,350
I was five years old.

7
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:50,183
Listen,

8
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,308
after you watch this movie,

9
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,974
you will never see another one.

10
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,266
I've told you,

11
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,891
cinema is not suitable for us.

12
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:00,849
So why are we going?

13
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,556
This time it is different.

14
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,599
It is a religious film,

15
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,017
<i>Goddess Mahakali.</i>

16
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:12,807
At 15:30,

17
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,391
at 18:30 and 21:30.

18
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,142
Three times a day.

19
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,641
For you, it is the first

20
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:22,641
and the last time.

21
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:33,515
<i>Holy Mother</i>

22
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,599
<i>Kali lives in the minds
of all her devotees</i>

23
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,599
<i>Slay all the demons</i>

24
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:48,390
<i>Blessed be the goddess Kali</i>.

25
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,599
Dad...

26
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,891
Manu wants to be a stationmaster.

27
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,474
S.T. wants to be an engineer.

28
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,306
And I want to make movies.

29
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:20,641
Shut up.

30
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,099
Don't say that again.

31
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,933
Have you ever heard of a Brahmin

32
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,474
with such a horrible job?

33
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:30,142
The world of cinema is rotten,

34
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,265
it is not pure.

35
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,975
We would lose all our honor
in the community.

36
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:35,849
What honor?

37
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,141
Look what you've done today,

38
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,765
making tea

39
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,850
and washing cups all day long.

40
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:43,099
"Buy me tea!".

41
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:46,808
How dare you?

42
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,516
- "Tea, tea!"
- That's enough!

43
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,975
- The train has arrived.
- Late, as usual.

44
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,600
Always wasting time.

45
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,098
Do you want to end up like me?

46
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,599
Get to work.

47
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,349
Yes, daddy.

48
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:32,017
Wafers! A packet for ten rupees.

49
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,516
Chai tea, hot chai tea!

50
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,057
Wafers!

51
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:51,683
Thank you.

52
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:58,016
Hot chai tea!

53
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,640
- What station is this?
- Chalala.

54
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:26,933
How did it go?

55
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,558
A pittance.

56
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:30,433
Ten, twenty...

57
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,224
Thirty rupees.

58
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,140
Me too, only 30 rupees.

59
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,516
A plane was flying.

60
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,600
It landed in a field of sunflowers.

61
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,140
A balloon seller

62
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:48,098
tried to board the plane.

63
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,849
But, then,
a strong gust of wind

64
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:52,224
brought him down.

65
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,642
The plane belonged to a king.

66
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,350
- to a king?
- Yes.

67
00:10:58,516 --> 00:10:59,390
Was he a rich king?

68
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,265
Yes, he was loaded.

69
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:02,849
He had a lot of stuff,

70
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:04,474
cars,

71
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:08,308
SUVs, guns, swords...

72
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:11,475
He had three courtesans.

73
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:13,433
The first one was called Meghana.

74
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,391
The second, Menaka.

75
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,432
And third, Piana.

76
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,182
That's some hair you're wearing.

77
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,056
Cut it.

78
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:52,599
Why do you always mess with my hair?

79
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:21,223
Samay!

80
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:35,641
Don't fool around.

81
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:37,931
Come back soon.

82
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,890
Yes!

83
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,974
- What's up, Siddi Dada?
- Get in!

84
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,849
Good morning, Siddi!

85
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,848
The year is 2010,

86
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,432
and our region of Saurastra
has two more names.

87
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:16,642
One of them is Sorath.

88
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,767
- Which one is the other one?
- Kathiawar.

89
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,891
Our great Kathiawar.

90
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,308
Our land is not only famous
for its lions and cows.

91
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,432
Many great men were born here.

92
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:31,600
Can you name one?

93
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:32,848
Gandhi!

94
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,140
Gandhi!

95
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,474
He fought to achieve
our independence.

96
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,684
But without blood and bullets.

97
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,182
And that's why we call him

98
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,350
the devotee of non-violence.

99
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,266
- Devotee of what?
- Nonviolence!

100
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,891
Of non-violence.

101
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,517
S.T., come here!

102
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,600
Yeah, daddy.

103
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,766
Stay away from the tea seller's son.

104
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,433
- Yes, Dad.
- You're free to go.

105
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,308
Baba, keep your money.

106
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,523
Your blessings are enough for me.

107
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:14,642
How much have you earned?

108
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:15,599
55 rupees.

109
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:16,724
To the cashier.

110
00:15:18,225 --> 00:15:19,349
A refreshment.

111
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:21,766
Here you have it.

112
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:46,849
An entry for <i>The Mafioso.</i>

113
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,517
Was Samay in school?

114
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,225
- Yes.
- No.

115
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,600
Was he there or not?

116
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:35,765
- No, he wasn't.
- Yes.

117
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:38,932
Yes.

118
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,890
His name is Samay.

119
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:46,558
Don't worry.

120
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:49,099
He's sleeping on a bench
at Amreli station.

121
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:07,933
Samay is going to have
his ass red for life.

122
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,640
It's showtime!

123
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,516
Stop!

124
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,640
Don't run!

125
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,765
You'd better stop!

126
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,807
You've been warned!

127
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,808
Stand still!

128
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,891
Our next class

129
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:50,558
will consist of physics practices
on light.

130
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,349
Samay.

131
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:01,849
Yes, sir?

132
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,391
What are these bruises?

133
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:08,557
My father beat me.

134
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,598
I went to see a film.

135
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,766
What now?

136
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,016
Traits of an ideal child

137
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,017
<i>Great and magnificent emperor,</i>

138
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,100
<i>leader by royal decree</i>

139
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,598
<i>May your life be eternal</i>

140
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,391
<i>Words do not convey
your greatness</i>

141
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,225
<i>You are the heart of Hindustan</i>

142
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,141
<i>Hindustan is your life</i>

143
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:57,266
<i>And you are the life of Hindustan</i>

144
00:19:57,683 --> 00:20:01,849
<i>We welcome you
to our hearts!</i>

145
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,892
Let go of me!

146
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,390
Let go of me!

147
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,891
Fucking scrounger!

148
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:49,225
Get that kid out of here!

149
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:53,225
Get out!

150
00:20:53,474 --> 00:20:54,267
Get lost!

151
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,557
Don't come back here.

152
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:25,975
What a fine chapati!

153
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,849
My wife makes them very thick.

154
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,016
They're like eating a blanket!

155
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,307
My mother makes them very thin.

156
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,349
She's the best cook in the world.

157
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:47,266
Do you want some?

158
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,432
I'm not hungry anymore.

159
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,391
What a treat!

160
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:39,683
Do you eat food like this every day?

161
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:42,600
Every day?

162
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,641
Why are you sad?

163
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,141
What's the matter with you?

164
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:52,016
I had no entry.

165
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,265
That assface kicked me out.

166
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:04,683
Come with me.

167
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,225
That assface!

168
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,348
Don't touch anything.

169
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,142
Come, sit down.

170
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:47,391
Here.

171
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:52,725
And now,

172
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,099
you can watch the film

173
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:58,224
from here.

174
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:08,557
For free?

175
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:15,348
We will make a deal.

176
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,807
<i>Salam Aleikum.</i>

177
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:21,017
My name is Fazal.

178
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,224
I am Samay.

179
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:27,099
Samay? It means "time", doesn't it?

180
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,725
Why Samay?

181
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:34,142
My parents had nothing, no job,

182
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,516
no money, nowhere to go.

183
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,391
They only had time,
that's why they had me.

184
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:41,516
And, when I was born,

185
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,474
they called me Samay.

186
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:47,016
My time is frozen

187
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:48,307
like this watch.

188
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:36,349
Quickly!

189
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:38,140
Come on, give it to me.

190
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,474
<i>No!</i>

191
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,558
<i>Get out of there!</i>

192
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:23,724
<i>You're going to find out!</i>

193
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:25,558
<i>Why did you hit my car?</i>

194
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:26,099
I bet ten rupees,
who gets up first?

195
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,391
That one there.

196
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,182
I won.

197
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:12,600
Hurry up!

198
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:14,433
You're going to miss the train.

199
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,891
Never! I'm faster than the train.

200
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,766
You hate okra.

201
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,725
Why did you ask to be put on?

202
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:26,724
I've started to like it a lot.

203
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:32,641
Liar.

204
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:33,642
To tell the truth,

205
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:36,224
I hate okra.

206
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,266
That was a joke.

207
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:41,641
Even though you brought me
my favorite food.

208
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,849
You know what white people call it?

209
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,684
"Ladyfingers."

210
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,433
Who's this?

211
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,558
Do you know who that is, Sili?

212
00:31:58,432 --> 00:31:59,807
Don't you know?

213
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,016
It is Shahrukh Khan.

214
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,391
<i>Badshah!</i>

215
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:09,224
<i>Shoot me!</i>

216
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:14,474
<i>Show me your sea of fire!</i>

217
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,765
<i>Pierce my chest with your bullets!</i>

218
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:21,891
<i>My love will always triumph.</i>

219
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:28,182
Fazal!

220
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:31,266
Samay!

221
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,016
Show me your food!

222
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,765
Put your mother's food in front of me.

223
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,600
Those fine chapatis,

224
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:44,516
the radish,

225
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:46,641
onion, cucumber...

226
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,140
Pierce my chest with your bullets!

227
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,558
My love will always triumph!

228
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,224
Today,

229
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,517
we're going to eat together.

230
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:03,559
Will you let me watch the film?

231
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:04,723
The film?

232
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,266
Of course.

233
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:08,849
The truth is, I'm starving.

234
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,349
Prepare the next reel.

235
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:18,933
Fazal,

236
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:21,933
how are these films made?

237
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,475
The films?

238
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,141
They're for storytelling.

239
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,141
The stories

240
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,349
and the films

241
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,434
have a long relationship.

242
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:52,515
Just like politicians

243
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,849
tell stories to win votes.

244
00:35:58,641 --> 00:35:59,433
The salesmen

245
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:02,058
tell stories
to sell their products.

246
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,557
And the rich tell stories

247
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:06,933
to hide their fortunes.

248
00:36:08,724 --> 00:36:11,473
The future belongs
to those who tell stories.

249
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,308
This consists of

250
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,598
storytelling.

251
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,682
In knowing how to tell lies.

252
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:24,765
In telling the truth,

253
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,725
I'm very good at lying.

254
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:50,724
Guys,

255
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,599
we have to capture the light.

256
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,807
But that's impossible.

257
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,891
If we want to project light,

258
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,306
first we have to capture it.

259
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:04,473
Yes, but how?

260
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:59,390
Are you stupid?

261
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:01,057
I am trying to capture it.

262
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,724
Dave, sir.

263
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,265
I want to be movies.

264
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,767
No, not "be" movies.

265
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:40,932
"Make" films.

266
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,724
My father says
we can't do that.

267
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,850
Brahmins
should not make films.

268
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:49,515
He says that the world of cinema
is disgusting.

269
00:41:50,432 --> 00:41:51,558
Listen, Samay.

270
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:54,767
In 2010, there are only
two castes in India.

271
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:55,932
Two?

272
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:56,975
The first one,

273
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,265
those who speak English.

274
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,599
The second,

275
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,849
those who do not speak it.

276
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,599
If you want to achieve something
in our country,

277
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,140
you need to do two things.

278
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:08,599
The first

279
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:10,682
is to learn English.

280
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:11,766
And the second one?

281
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,974
Get the hell out of Chalala!

282
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,224
- Leave?
- Yes.

283
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,641
Go and learn.

284
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:28,017
<i>Khwaja, love of my life</i>

285
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:31,140
<i>Lives in my heart</i>

286
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:35,932
<i>Khwaja, love of my life</i>

287
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:40,266
<i>Lives in my heart</i>

288
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:46,140
<i>You offer a destiny
to the helpless</i>

289
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:53,766
I'm not young like you.

290
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:56,891
I have a wife and two daughters.

291
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,432
If I didn't, I would live in Turkey,

292
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,849
with Sufis.

293
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,558
Dad, can I ask you something?

294
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,099
No.

295
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:31,808
Do you think that one day
we will get out of Chalala?

296
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:20,766
Are you blind?

297
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:12,432
Going to that abandoned village

298
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,724
is not a good idea.

299
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:18,016
Don't worry, there won't be any ghosts.

300
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,932
Just us.

301
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:33,308
Tiku.

302
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:42,057
Manu.

303
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:49,725
S.T.

304
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:55,973
Nano.

305
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,224
I see something.

306
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:34,433
It's working!

307
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:41,183
When the truck started to accelerate,

308
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,015
the god Shiva appeared.

309
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:46,683
The truck said to him

310
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:50,474
"Big Shiva, get in, please!"

311
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,725
But Shiva said "No".

312
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:55,641
Then a queen appeared.

313
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:58,266
She's cross-eyed!

314
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,808
And then Shiva was transformed

315
00:47:02,974 --> 00:47:05,182
into an avatar of a demon.

316
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:07,099
After that,

317
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:10,224
he built a huge palace.

318
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:11,558
Another queen!

319
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:51,391
What are you cooking? It smells good.

320
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:53,099
Spinach ravioli.

321
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,140
We need to repaint

322
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:10,641
the entire facade.

323
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,308
My mother's <i>palak-dhokli</i>.

324
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:14,223
Really?

325
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:17,642
Spinach ravioli

326
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:19,807
cooked with lentils.

327
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:22,684
And as a side dish...

328
00:48:23,848 --> 00:48:27,349
Mum's special coriander,
mint and tamarind paste.

329
00:48:33,016 --> 00:48:34,932
You're asking too much just to paint it!

330
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,265
Sir, nowadays
the workers are engaged in

331
00:48:37,432 --> 00:48:39,182
diamond cutting.

332
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:41,308
I don't need workers.

333
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:43,474
What I need are craftsmen.

334
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:45,557
The craftsmen have gone to Dubai

335
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:47,349
to build more Taj Mahals.

336
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,224
My final price is 30 000 rupees.

337
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:51,433
Thirty thousand?

338
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,140
I'd need 500 screenings
filling the room

339
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:55,975
to make that kind of money.

340
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,433
With the films that are out there nowadays,

341
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:01,058
that will never happen.

342
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:02,933
I don't accept less than 30 000.

343
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:04,517
Then get the hell out of here!

344
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:26,765
Would you like some tea?

345
00:49:27,642 --> 00:49:29,433
- Are you the tea seller?
- Yes, he is.

346
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:32,015
Are you a Brahmin?

347
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:32,974
Yes, sir.

348
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:34,140
And you sell tea?

349
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,599
Did you get the letter?

350
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,641
Yes, sir, but...

351
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:42,974
It was in English, I couldn't read it.

352
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:46,391
They're going to build
a wide railway track.

353
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:49,350
The train will use electricity.

354
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:51,765
They will not renew the licence

355
00:49:51,932 --> 00:49:52,891
of your tea stall.

356
00:49:55,765 --> 00:49:57,600
So you have to remove it.

357
00:49:58,558 --> 00:49:59,891
Lock it up.

358
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:01,600
But, sir,

359
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,183
the passengers need it.

360
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:06,807
Passengers...

361
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:11,141
Listen, the trains

362
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:13,890
will pass this way without stopping.

363
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:16,600
No one will get off at this station.

364
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,474
Do you understand?

365
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,682
Where will the passengers come from?

366
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,391
So do it, please.

367
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:31,016
What bad luck this man has.

368
00:50:31,391 --> 00:50:33,973
He used to have 500 cows.

369
00:50:34,392 --> 00:50:36,849
His brothers cheated him
and stole them all.

370
00:50:37,057 --> 00:50:38,266
And, after that,

371
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,808
he started selling tea.

372
00:50:47,475 --> 00:50:50,057
You should have taken
all your clothes off.

373
00:50:50,224 --> 00:50:52,265
- Naked?
- But there were girls.

374
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:56,558
What's the difference?
Next time, we'll swim naked.

375
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:59,475
Yeah. It's no fun swimming with clothes on.

376
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:00,516
Naked!

377
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:02,224
We'll see next time.

378
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:46,183
The film has changed.

379
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,557
The whole film is here?

380
00:51:48,723 --> 00:51:50,556
Yes, all the reels.

381
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:56,974
Samay!

382
00:51:58,266 --> 00:51:59,058
Is he for real?

383
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:00,891
We've been looking at those boxes

384
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:02,475
since we were born.

385
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:04,974
Don't look!

386
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:07,933
But we didn't know
that each one of those boxes

387
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,932
has a whole film in it.

388
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:11,765
Don't look.

389
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:15,556
They take them from here
to the big cities,

390
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:17,891
like Rajkot, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar...

391
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:12,558
Be careful.

392
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,182
Look out,

393
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,015
an eagle hunts a sheep.

394
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:24,432
Ala! The Himalayas.

395
00:53:24,682 --> 00:53:26,974
Look what a strange animal.

396
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:28,391
Look at this.

397
00:53:28,848 --> 00:53:29,807
Look at this!

398
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:31,557
He's killed the sheep.

399
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:36,016
Here they kill a poor man

400
00:53:36,266 --> 00:53:37,474
in cold blood.

401
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:39,267
Oh, man!

402
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:59,142
Look, a pretty girl
shaking her ass!

403
00:54:14,516 --> 00:54:15,891
What's happened?

404
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:17,599
Half the song is missing!

405
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:21,807
Where's the girl?

406
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,308
That was the best part!

407
00:54:57,808 --> 00:54:58,723
What a load of crap!

408
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:02,683
This is the first time this has happened.

409
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:03,892
Remain calm.

410
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,683
You've sullied yourselves

411
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:08,348
my favourite scene
by Amitabh Bachchan!

412
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:12,184
Let's get our money back.

413
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:14,391
Give us our money back!

414
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:15,975
Give it back to us!

415
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:42,266
Now we know
why you were truant.

416
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:45,975
Guys, we can't make movies,

417
00:56:46,224 --> 00:56:47,891
but we can show them.

418
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:52,100
My father can't find out.

419
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:58,223
Don't worry, neither your father nor mine,

420
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,891
no one will know about this.

421
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:09,641
Can't see anything.

422
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:14,474
Looks terrible.

423
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:20,306
We've carried this thing 3 km for nothing.

424
00:57:23,058 --> 00:57:24,142
What a piece of shit!

425
00:58:26,474 --> 00:58:27,974
Why don't you watch the films?

426
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:32,558
There aren't any left.

427
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,224
I've seen them all.

428
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:36,932
But remember one thing.

429
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,475
Movies were created
to deceive people.

430
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:42,017
What idiots!

431
00:58:45,516 --> 00:58:46,432
Come on.

432
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:50,641
Look at the screen,

433
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,724
blinking very fast

434
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:54,432
and tell me what you see.

435
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:00,641
I see darkness.

436
00:59:00,808 --> 00:59:01,890
You see it, don't you?

437
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:04,017
Come on.

438
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:06,432
Listen.

439
00:59:06,765 --> 00:59:07,808
Pay attention.

440
00:59:08,182 --> 00:59:10,975
We think that the film
happens continuously.

441
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:12,224
Right?

442
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:13,850
But it's not like that.

443
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:16,849
The truth is that it stops.

444
00:59:17,017 --> 00:59:18,642
Picture after picture.

445
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:21,557
One, two, three, four...

446
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,473
It's moving slowly.

447
00:59:24,307 --> 00:59:26,557
Between the light and the image,

448
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:28,140
there is a shutter

449
00:59:28,557 --> 00:59:29,849
that doesn't let the light through.

450
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:31,849
It opens, it closes...

451
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:34,641
Like this.

452
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:37,683
When it closes, the tape moves.

453
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:39,682
When the light passes,

454
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,432
the tape stops.

455
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,683
Passing light, tape stops,

456
00:59:44,807 --> 00:59:47,224
shutter closes,
tape moves.

457
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:48,390
Do you understand?

458
00:59:48,892 --> 00:59:49,641
That's why

459
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:53,600
you see darkness on the screen.

460
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:59,349
Those idiots sitting in the theatre
for three hours

461
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,265
they don't have a clue

462
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:03,892
that, for an hour,
they see darkness.

463
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:10,056
It's a crazy thing.

464
01:00:11,515 --> 01:00:13,182
It's all a lie.

465
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:14,016
Do you get it?

466
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,683
Why haven't you paid
my school fees?

467
01:00:23,892 --> 01:00:24,932
The school thing?

468
01:00:25,308 --> 01:00:27,016
Wait, I'll tell you now.

469
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:29,516
Stay there.

470
01:00:29,766 --> 01:00:30,766
Let me explain.

471
01:00:30,933 --> 01:00:31,850
Don't move!

472
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:34,932
There, hold still!

473
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:36,682
You're not going to class

474
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:38,473
to watch movies.

475
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,432
And you're asking me about school expenses!

476
01:00:41,682 --> 01:00:42,391
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

477
01:00:42,808 --> 01:00:43,892
How dare you?

478
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,350
How dare you?

479
01:00:46,892 --> 01:00:48,642
Who do you think you are?

480
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:12,224
Samay!

481
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:15,974
There he is. Get that punk!

482
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:17,516
Listen, please.

483
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:18,683
Get him out of here.

484
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:19,891
Wait for it!

485
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,015
Get out!

486
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:24,349
- Sir, your backpack.
- Shut up!

487
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,808
If I ever see this bastard again,

488
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:32,558
I'll fire you.

489
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,141
Be careful!

490
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:35,683
Be warned.

491
01:01:54,432 --> 01:01:55,641
Does it mean that

492
01:01:55,808 --> 01:01:58,348
that you won't be able to go back
into the Galaxy cinema?

493
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:05,015
What about our cinema projector?

494
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:08,015
Say something.

495
01:02:57,391 --> 01:02:58,974
Here's a sewing machine!

496
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:03,683
Hey, brother!

497
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,307
What fun!

498
01:05:25,516 --> 01:05:28,558
<i>This guy is the best</i>

499
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:32,266
<i>This guy is the best</i>

500
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:44,682
<i>There is a great storm inside</i>

501
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:48,350
<i>He is an idiot and a dreamer</i>

502
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:52,016
<i>This guy is the best</i>.

503
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,640
- Hello.
- We need your help.

504
01:06:35,974 --> 01:06:37,016
We're screwed.

505
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,557
The police are asking
about the reels.

506
01:06:40,849 --> 01:06:42,058
Don't worry,

507
01:06:42,224 --> 01:06:45,433
our things are
in the abandoned village.

508
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,641
Listen, the last ones we stole

509
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:50,739
are still in that room over there.

510
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,433
Idiot.

511
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:54,141
Let's do something.

512
01:06:56,307 --> 01:06:57,807
There have been many complaints

513
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,681
of missing reels.

514
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:02,308
We know they were stolen from here.

515
01:07:03,308 --> 01:07:05,974
Complaints have come in

516
01:07:06,224 --> 01:07:07,890
from many dealers.

517
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,890
Who went into that room?

518
01:07:45,058 --> 01:07:46,307
Do you want me to lock you in?

519
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:48,724
Bunch of thieves.

520
01:07:50,308 --> 01:07:51,057
No, sir.

521
01:07:52,723 --> 01:07:53,974
Let them go.

522
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,266
It was me.

523
01:12:41,015 --> 01:12:42,183
Hot tea!

524
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:44,016
Chalala wafers!

525
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:48,391
Chalala wafers!

526
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:50,225
The real wafers of Gujarat!

527
01:12:52,975 --> 01:12:53,891
After the train,

528
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:55,724
we go to the abandoned village.

529
01:13:04,306 --> 01:13:05,183
Here we go.

530
01:13:13,766 --> 01:13:16,184
I hope that hovel
wasn't so bad.

531
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,349
It was horrible.

532
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:20,974
But the good thing

533
01:13:21,142 --> 01:13:22,515
is that it gave me an idea.

534
01:13:22,933 --> 01:13:25,265
Our films don't have to be silent.

535
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,474
Samay, thanks for not snitching
about us

536
01:13:28,724 --> 01:13:29,975
to the police.

537
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:31,683
That's why,

538
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:33,891
we have prepared a surprise for you.

539
01:13:34,057 --> 01:13:35,183
A surprise?

540
01:14:00,474 --> 01:14:04,141
Sir, I told them
not to do it, but...

541
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:05,058
Just take it easy.

542
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,141
This is unbelievable.

543
01:14:08,432 --> 01:14:09,141
Bravo!

544
01:14:10,515 --> 01:14:11,183
Yes, sir?

545
01:14:11,349 --> 01:14:12,223
Guys,

546
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:13,641
you've done well.

547
01:14:15,349 --> 01:14:18,058
But what are these circles?
the triangles

548
01:14:18,307 --> 01:14:20,016
and the other doodles?

549
01:14:20,974 --> 01:14:22,473
What does <i>"galaxy"</i> mean?

550
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:24,558
<i>Galaxy?</i>

551
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:26,349
See,

552
01:14:27,348 --> 01:14:28,891
you should learn English.

553
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:29,933
Samay!

554
01:14:32,223 --> 01:14:33,391
Good job.

555
01:14:33,974 --> 01:14:35,890
Can we watch movies for free now?

556
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:37,557
Yes.

557
01:16:15,307 --> 01:16:16,766
Today, you eat first.

558
01:16:24,891 --> 01:16:26,141
Try this.

559
01:16:37,642 --> 01:16:38,682
Samay!

560
01:16:39,098 --> 01:16:40,640
Have you seen my white sari?

561
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:41,516
No.

562
01:16:46,808 --> 01:16:48,516
Mum, look what I have for you.

563
01:16:56,808 --> 01:16:58,641
Are you up to something?

564
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:00,975
Yes.

565
01:17:06,683 --> 01:17:08,474
That's a very nice jar.

566
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,141
Run! Bandits!

567
01:19:17,558 --> 01:19:19,475
Run! We're under attack by bandits!

568
01:19:39,058 --> 01:19:39,932
Sing!

569
01:19:50,684 --> 01:19:51,808
He's been dumped by another girl!

570
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:21,599
Samay, run!
Urgent call from Fazal.

571
01:21:31,474 --> 01:21:32,392
Hello?

572
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:34,100
- <i>Samay?</i>
- Yes.

573
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,308
<i>It's a catastrophe! Come quickly!</i>

574
01:21:36,932 --> 01:21:38,682
Tell me what happened.

575
01:21:39,683 --> 01:21:42,725
<i>It's urgent! You have to come now!</i>

576
01:21:42,891 --> 01:21:45,891
No trains run at this hour.

577
01:21:46,516 --> 01:21:47,475
<i>Think about it.</i>

578
01:23:20,724 --> 01:23:21,890
Samay, see...

579
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,140
It is over.

580
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:33,933
This was the last projection.

581
01:23:37,558 --> 01:23:39,600
At least tell me what happened.

582
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,182
I've been fired.

583
01:23:47,807 --> 01:23:48,933
Why?

584
01:23:51,183 --> 01:23:52,225
Go and see for yourself.

585
01:24:35,517 --> 01:24:36,557
Did you see it?

586
01:24:40,307 --> 01:24:42,183
To use that modern projector,

587
01:24:44,516 --> 01:24:46,266
you need to know English.

588
01:24:54,016 --> 01:24:55,766
And you know me.

589
01:24:56,016 --> 01:24:58,057
I'm neither a letter man nor a number man.

590
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:15,641
What about films?

591
01:25:21,723 --> 01:25:23,598
Get rid of this rubbish.

592
01:25:24,058 --> 01:25:25,015
Come on!

593
01:25:26,058 --> 01:25:28,391
Samay, the trucks are leaving!

594
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:52,100
Take the short cut!

595
01:26:17,225 --> 01:26:18,725
Lagrabhai!

596
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:20,265
Enough!

597
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,307
Tiku, take the others home.

598
01:26:23,683 --> 01:26:24,599
OK, daddy.

599
01:26:41,016 --> 01:26:43,391
Oh, my goodness! We have reached Rajkot.

600
01:35:18,433 --> 01:35:20,516
Can you tell me what happened

601
01:35:20,808 --> 01:35:22,099
with the trucks?

602
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:27,973
I think it's better you don't know.

603
01:35:36,808 --> 01:35:39,349
Why are you taking me to Chalala?

604
01:35:42,724 --> 01:35:44,682
My friend S.T.'s father

605
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:47,391
is the station manager.

606
01:35:47,557 --> 01:35:49,307
I want you to meet him.

607
01:36:42,682 --> 01:36:43,683
Are you coming to play?

608
01:36:47,766 --> 01:36:49,515
Shall we make bets with the lions?

609
01:36:49,684 --> 01:36:51,057
No.

610
01:37:53,058 --> 01:37:54,057
You'll be a station boy

611
01:37:54,224 --> 01:37:55,599
on the new line.

612
01:37:55,765 --> 01:37:56,642
Until then,

613
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:58,558
you'll keep an eye on the parcel room.

614
01:38:00,266 --> 01:38:00,932
Thank you, sir.

615
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,349
And thanks to you.

616
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:53,016
Samay.

617
01:38:55,599 --> 01:38:56,392
Yes, daddy?

618
01:39:00,433 --> 01:39:02,307
You don't like my hair.

619
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:04,974
Let's go to the hairdresser

620
01:39:05,349 --> 01:39:06,475
to get it cut.

621
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:15,266
Son,

622
01:39:16,724 --> 01:39:18,141
why do you want to leave?

623
01:39:28,058 --> 01:39:29,683
I want to study the light.

624
01:39:31,183 --> 01:39:33,141
I want to know more about light.

625
01:39:34,432 --> 01:39:35,682
Because of the light

626
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:37,391
stories emerge.

627
01:39:38,682 --> 01:39:40,099
And from the stories

628
01:39:40,558 --> 01:39:41,642
the films emerge.

629
01:39:48,765 --> 01:39:50,308
Do you want to make films?

630
01:39:54,933 --> 01:39:57,765
Do you want to make real films?

631
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,182
Listen,

632
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,391
before S.T.'s father,

633
01:40:13,391 --> 01:40:16,267
there was another stationmaster,

634
01:40:17,016 --> 01:40:18,141
Sharma.

635
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:20,349
At that time,

636
01:40:20,807 --> 01:40:22,516
you were only five years old.

637
01:40:24,099 --> 01:40:24,766
Do you remember that?

638
01:40:25,848 --> 01:40:27,099
He was a friend of mine.

639
01:40:28,807 --> 01:40:31,225
Yeah, the only friend you ever had.

640
01:40:32,057 --> 01:40:33,100
That's enough.

641
01:40:34,808 --> 01:40:37,933
He now lives in Vadodara.

642
01:40:38,682 --> 01:40:39,599
He...

643
01:40:40,349 --> 01:40:42,016
I've spoken to him.

644
01:40:44,182 --> 01:40:45,308
About what?

645
01:40:46,392 --> 01:40:47,432
About you.

646
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:05,723
Go away.

647
01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:07,975
And learn.

648
01:41:11,142 --> 01:41:13,100
Did you talk to my teacher?

649
01:41:16,517 --> 01:41:17,808
Are you going to let me go?

650
01:41:19,599 --> 01:41:20,682
Are you for real?

651
01:41:21,891 --> 01:41:22,598
Yes.

652
01:41:24,849 --> 01:41:26,267
When?

653
01:41:27,975 --> 01:41:29,140
Now.

654
01:41:34,349 --> 01:41:35,557
You have exactly

655
01:41:36,641 --> 01:41:37,975
fourteen minutes

656
01:41:38,516 --> 01:41:39,933
until the train leaves.

657
01:41:40,516 --> 01:41:41,932
Only fourteen minutes?

658
01:41:56,267 --> 01:41:58,100
You'd better get going.

659
01:42:01,183 --> 01:42:03,515
before I change my mind.

660
01:42:47,057 --> 01:42:48,100
Run!

661
01:46:00,432 --> 01:46:02,306
For women only

662
01:46:33,265 --> 01:46:34,933
Those bracelets are red and green.

663
01:46:39,349 --> 01:46:42,016
They must be the avatar
of director Manmohan Desai.

664
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:50,682
And these must be the avatar
of Amitabh Bachchan.

665
