Just let me, there you go.

Oops, I do apologize.

175
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:55,009

- Yes, okay.

Hmm, no, not really.

Yeah, the only thing that
you better at

259
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,375
than stealing

You're a damn legend.

How many of Schultz's

262
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,741
By my count, four, give or take.

263
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,774

Built by the same guy?

He don't love it at all.

267

And that don't have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife.

268
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,008
Schultz didn't come to extradite
you back to his prison.

269
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,807
Those papers were forged.
He was there to kill you.

270
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,375
Judging by your contributions to society thus
far, I can't say it was the wrong choice.

a chance to turn things around.

Well, you know Schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones.

281
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:45,107
But terrorism? Well,
that's a bit of a stretch.

282
00:21:45,308 --> 00:21:47,408
Yeah, you'd think
until Schultz realized

283
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,807
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells.

284
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,375

and let him go.</i>

Turns out that Jason Quick is actually
Jasim bin something or something.

One of the top dogs
of Muslim Brotherhood's son.

292

In bed, under the covers with some KY

- 'Cause you're a thief.

00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:48,641
Let me stop you right there.
Yes, I'm a thief...

- Where are you from?

Thank you. You know what?
That is so funny.

406
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:44,842
because I thought you prefer
to drink alone.

you insisted.

408

That's very interesting because actually...
she's my daughter.

412

And I don't know you, friend.

413
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:15,875
The gentleman, he had
to run away there,

414
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:19,607
but he said for his drinks,
our drinks on his room. Thank you so much.

415

swift move back there.

quite the teacher.

the right thing to do at the time.

- The money. The gold.

- There won't be any.
- What do you mean there won't be any,

471
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:07,575
I thought that was the point
of the story. Steal the gold.

472
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:11,441
It is. But that doesn't mean
they'll be any gold to split.

from financing terrorism.

their gold, stop the terrorists.

got hold of your information

or who told you I might even have any

00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:34,908
We tried.

498
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,173
VIOLET: Jazeristan is
an important US ally.

499
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:40,641
U.S. Centcom uses Al Udeid
Air Base to launch assaults

500
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:44,008
in the Middle East. America doesn't
need to ask too many questions,

501
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:47,140
and Jazeristan doesn't
need to find any answers.

502
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:51,073
Do they know about this?

503
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,674
They know, but they
don't know, you know?

504
00:37:57,574 --> 00:38:01,408
(WHISPERS) Come on, darling,
what am I gonna do here?

505
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,574
This. I want you to do this.

506
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:11,107
(INHALES) Look, Dad,
we need you.

507
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:14,574
I need you.

508
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:20,207
Just this once, I'm asking
you not to walk out the door.

509
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,974
I must need my head examined.

510
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,974
Yeah, I feel like I should mention
something about Abu Hirawa.

511
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,707
I mean it's kind of his gold
we're after.

512
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:38,375
In Arabic,
Hirawa means cane.

513
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,541
(SPEAKING IN ARABIC)

514
00:38:50,741 --> 00:38:51,807
(GRUNTS)

515
00:38:58,474 --> 00:38:59,741
(SLURPS)

516
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:02,375
And that was this gardener.

517
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,073
Oh well. (CHUCKLES)
That's good to know.

518
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:10,874
Prison. Hard to get into,
even harder to get out of.

519
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,741
Especially with
a truckload of gold.

520
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,908
First question.
Where's the gold?

521
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:19,140
We got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land,

522
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,574
but we still don't know
where the vault is.

523
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,674
Do you have surveillance
photos on this facility?

524
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:24,607
Yeah, we have. Come, I show you.

525
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:28,774
Facility is state-of-the-art,
one of the most modern prisons on Earth.

526
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:31,941
And it's completely self-contained...
food, water, everything.

527
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,574
Wait. Go back.

528
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:38,341
Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. Left.

529
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,641
If the prison's self-sustained,

530
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,275
I would expect there's a fully
functioning laundry on the inside.

531
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,774
Yeah. Right next to the kitchen.
Using the same venting system.

532
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:49,741
That's the steam in the photo.

533
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,474
Mm. Right, but it doesn't,
does it, really?

534
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,574
Because while my Arabic
is little bit rusty,

535
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:58,140
I'm pretty sure...
that's a laundry truck.

536
00:39:58,507 --> 00:40:00,974
Meaning Schultz built the prison
without installing

537
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,674
an actual industrial laundry.

538
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:05,707
Just a system to generate
steam for appearances.

539
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:08,607
- And built a vault instead.
- (LAUGHS)

540
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,208
Voila! Now we know
where the gold is.

541
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,407
- Right under the shitter.
- Let's go to prison, shall we?

542
00:40:14,607 --> 00:40:19,807
Oh, and by the way,
I only fly first class.

543
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:22,375
- Me too!
- Oh-ho, congratulations.

544
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,208
Next time we'll be sure to book
your ticket on Princess Air.

545
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,707
Mm-hm. What do you
mean, next time?

546
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,941
This entire region
is on high alert.

547
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:32,874
A group like this, landing at the
airport will attract attention.

548
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,841
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
point remains the same.

549
00:40:35,174 --> 00:40:37,275
Trains, planes, automobiles.

550
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:41,107
I'm flexible...
as long as it's first class.

551
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:47,641
Hmm?

552
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,275
Why isn't anyone
saying anything?

553
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,574
(GROANS)

554
00:40:55,174 --> 00:40:57,275
Please, tell me you're joking!

555
00:40:57,407 --> 00:41:01,008
We got to fit in.
Vehicles will be scrutinized.

556
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:03,141
Camels. Muhammad
will be our guide.

557
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,108
- Which one is Muhammad?
- All of them.

558
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,040
- Oh.
- RINGO: My Muhammad.

559
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:11,707
There's about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of Jazeristan.

560
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:12,874
Well..

561
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,141
this prison isn't going
to rob itself. Let's go.

562
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,541
- By the way, you look great.
- Thank you. Don't be cheeky.

563
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:22,741
Which camel's mine. Can I get this guy?
He looks friendly.

564
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:25,141
(MUSIC PLAYING)

565
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:38,374
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this?

566
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,774
Believe me, I'm not so nice.

567
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:44,108
They didn't ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition.

568
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:46,507
So it's not because
you couldn't find a date.

569
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:51,474
No, I'm very good
at finding dates.

570
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,607
Even better at losing them.

571
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:56,974
You might want to change
your line of work.

572
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:01,275
- Could increase your odds.
- Says the thief.

573
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:03,574
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

574
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:05,541
No, I decided a long time ago

575
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,340
that if I can't be good
to someone,

576
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,074
I can at least try
and be good to everyone.

577
00:42:11,607 --> 00:42:13,174
Good philosophy.

578
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:34,807
(GRUNTS)

579
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:36,674
You know...

580
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:41,574
They say that people
on their deathbeds...

581
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:44,641
never regret
the things they did,

582
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:48,374
just... the things
they didn't do.

583
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:52,407
This sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret.

584
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,741
We're going to do something
very dangerous here soon.

585
00:42:57,674 --> 00:43:00,074
If there's some
kind of connection, well...

586
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,807
It would be a shame
if we die

587
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,141
without
really saying our feelings.

588
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:10,240
Did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die?

589
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:14,340
Nope. Never crossed my mind.

590
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,108
It's not you, Pace,

591
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,707
from an empirical point of view,

592
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:22,741
you are a very attractive man.

593
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:27,607
You see I don't... date men.

594
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,108
I kill them.

595
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,340
One can only try.

596
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:51,274
(WINDS BLOWING)

00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:16,541

- HOPE: Hey.

599
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,507
You okay?

600
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:26,507
Yeah, I'm fine.

601
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,607
- Just a little scared.
- Yeah.

602
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,707
Well, it certainly
will have its risks.

603
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:39,574
Uh, I don't mean the prison.

604
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:43,207
Dad, you're doing this
for the right reasons, right?

605
00:44:43,707 --> 00:44:48,607
I mean... you're not going to do
like you always do and...

606
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:50,641
disappear in the final frame?

607
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:54,741
Do you mean...

608
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,641
- The gold?
- No.

609
00:45:02,107 --> 00:45:05,041
I mean... disappear without me.

610
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,674
Oh, Hope...

611
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:16,240
I really would like to promise
you that, I really would.

612
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:23,407
There's a beautiful line
I once read in a poem.

613
00:45:24,674 --> 00:45:28,340
"A man travels far to find out
who he really is."

614
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,240
Same goes for you.

615
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:36,307
Hold steady.

616
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,474
Hold steady.

617
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,574
(MUSIC PLAYING)

618
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:59,040
Get some rest.
It's a big day tomorrow.

619
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:24,374
(MAN PRAYING IN ARABIC)

620
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,975
- We'll be fine here.
- Why can't I stay with my dad?

621
00:46:30,008 --> 00:46:33,641
It's too risky. We don't want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone.

622
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:37,808
- That's comforting.
- Really?

623
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,307
No. It was a joke.

624
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,909
Hm.

625
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,107
Well, we usually don't
like to work with people

626
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,842
who have families
and loved ones.

627
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:50,107
Brings emotions into play.
And emotions cloud the mind.

628
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:56,909
What are you doing?

629
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:59,207
You never know when you have
to improvise on weapons.

630
00:47:07,173 --> 00:47:09,173
(GRUNTS) All right.

631
00:47:11,207 --> 00:47:12,407
What do you want to do?

632
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:15,507
Hmm. What kind of drugs
do you have?

633
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,875
I don't drink or take drugs.

634
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,875
Really? Maybe you should start.

635
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,909
Just a little something
to take the edge off.

636
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:23,974
If you want,
I could go score some.

637
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,140
Absolutely not,
that's dangerous.

638
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:27,574
I was joking.

639
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:30,775
God, you really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

640
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:32,207
Don't really have time for it.

641
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,607
Not much about what I do
is very funny.

642
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:39,708
Me neither.

643
00:47:46,808 --> 00:47:49,607
You know what? Let's focus on
what we love about our work.

644
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,274
Okay. I like to beat people up.

645
00:47:54,842 --> 00:47:56,541
Okay, cool. Yeah.

646
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:02,842
Well, let's say I am a guy
and I'm coming at you.

647
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:04,607
- A dumb guy.
- Right. Okay.

648
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,708
But I have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up. So,

649
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:09,507
you gotta take me down in one move.
What's your go-to?

650
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:11,140
- One shot?
- Yeah, that's it.

651
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:13,008
Easy. Punch to the throat.

652
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:14,440
- Not the jewels?
- No.

653
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,407
Men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk.

654
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:20,307
What may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure,

655
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,474
but a solid punch
the Adam's apple.

656
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,541
Down in a oner.

657
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:26,808
- Cool.
- Hmm!

658
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,675
You must have one badass dad.

659
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,274
Never knew him.

660
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:35,607
I'm sorry.

661
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,374
Yeah, well, me too.

662
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:44,541
Well, I for one,
would like to thank him.

663
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:47,541
If he hadn't abandoned you
and made you hate men so much,

664
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:49,274
you wouldn't taken up my fight.

665
00:48:52,008 --> 00:48:53,474
That's one way to look at it.

666
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:56,340
You're lucky to have

01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:07,340
Only in justice.
It won't come swiftly.

1175
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:20,173

1176
01:23:20,407 --> 01:23:23,775

- Of course not.
- RINGO: Good.

1184
01:23:59,173 --> 01:24:03,440
- Where's my dad?
- Sh... I don't know, he had to drive the truck here.

1185
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:10,642
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no what? We got it. This is good news.

1186
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:12,742
- No.
- He's around here somewhere.

1187
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:13,742
No.

1188
01:24:15,374 --> 01:24:17,173
I have a terrible
feeling he's not.

1189

1190

VIOLET: It's the original.

1191
01:24:31,407 --> 01:24:33,542
- Where's the gold?
- He took it.

1192
01:24:34,974 --> 01:24:36,008
And he's not coming back.

1193
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,708
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, this can't be.

1194
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:41,941
No, it can be,
it can so easily be.

1195
01:24:42,508 --> 01:24:45,107
Shit, I am so, so sorry.
I'm the one who vouched for him.

1196
01:24:45,173 --> 01:24:46,374
I brought him into
this whole thing.

1197
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:49,040
After a lifetime of disappointment,
I should have known better...

1198
01:24:50,974 --> 01:24:52,274
Far better.

1199
01:24:53,841 --> 01:24:55,207

1201
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:14,475
Dad?

1202
01:25:16,008 --> 01:25:17,274
Yes.

1203
01:25:19,274 --> 01:25:20,707
You stole the gold.

1204
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:25,040
I did.

1205
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:27,374
From us?

1206
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:30,107
Yep.

1207
01:25:30,407 --> 01:25:32,340
Then what the hell
you still doing here?

1208
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:36,475
Hopefully... fixing things.

1209
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,807
I cleaned it up a little.

1210
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:45,475
Oh.

1211
01:25:47,207 --> 01:25:48,441
(WHISPERS) Thank you.

1212
01:25:48,874 --> 01:25:51,073
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1213
01:25:55,008 --> 01:25:56,274
Uh, guys...

1214
01:25:56,674 --> 01:25:57,941
ALL: Shh...

1215
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,107
What are you shushing me,
we got stuff to do.

1216
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,441
You know what, this is
cute moment and everything

1217
01:26:03,542 --> 01:26:06,941
but we got a whole Sal,
big Sal... Sal-wa?

1218
01:26:07,073 --> 01:26:08,073
Salwan.

1219
01:26:08,274 --> 01:26:11,173
Salwan cargo plane
revved up and ready to go.

1220
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:14,475
Well, let's get the hell
out of Dodge. Grab the bird.

1221
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,608
- My man.
- PACE: Yes.

1222
01:26:22,274 --> 01:26:24,508
RINGO: <i>So, we grabbed the bird
and got the hell out of Dodge</i>

1223
01:26:24,608 --> 01:26:26,408
<i>on Prince's country's
cargo plane.</i>

1224
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,607
<i>Having a cargo plane
almost made me believe</i>

1225
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:31,340
<i>he was actually a prince.</i>

1226
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:34,307
<i>I said almost.</i>

1227
01:26:35,508 --> 01:26:37,340
- Yo Ringo! Got your drink.
- Hey!

1228
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:39,408
- Prince, for you.
- Thank you.

1229
01:26:39,874 --> 01:26:43,073
Hey, you all got umbrellas
where the hell is my umbrella?

1230
01:26:43,307 --> 01:26:45,040
I want an umbrella,
what type of shit is this?

1231
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:49,274
This is the life. I mean,
this is always my life.

1232
01:26:49,375 --> 01:26:52,073
Man, I can't believe
you're actually a prince.

1233
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,274
I mean, in the animal world,

1234
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,408
your parents would have
left you. Or eaten you.

1235
01:26:55,508 --> 01:26:58,575
Mm. A little training,
some skintight leather,

1236
01:26:58,874 --> 01:27:00,607
I could see myself
being a Misfit.

1237
01:27:01,974 --> 01:27:03,607
Don't even think about it.

1238
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,240
I'd like to start by
getting to know you again...

1239
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:08,974
in my retirement.

1240
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,674
Or maybe we can get to know
each other without retiring.

1241
01:27:14,073 --> 01:27:16,774
Yeah, Dad. What do you say?
Are you a Misfit?

1242
01:27:22,008 --> 01:27:23,707
No, actually, I think...

1243
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,707
I think I fit in just fine.

1244
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:31,375
(CHUCKLES) Here's to us, guys.

1245
01:27:31,974 --> 01:27:33,441
