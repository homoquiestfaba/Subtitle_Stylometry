And there's this tree.

00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,407
And the man says,
"Ooh, see that tree?

I'm sending her back in pieces
if I don't get what I want.

541
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,573
I'm gonna pull herfingers out
with pliers...

542
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,368
and then I'm gonna fry them up
for breakfast, understand?

543
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,871
And so on and so on
like that, OK?

544
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,375

No, I must've dialed
the wrong number.

No, I haven't got
your daughter here.

564

Well, I'm sure
your daughter's very nice.

In principle, I've got
no objections to meeting her--

What is the problem?

571

NAVILLE: How much?

578
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:25,807
Ourfee for the recovery
of your daughter is...

579

one hundred thousand dollars.

580
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,437
That's a lot of money.

Five thousand advance.

582
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,651
The rest is cash on delivery.
No daughter, no dough.

583
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,694
Naturally,
we operate a sliding scale...

584
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:39,530
whereby if we only bring back
part of your daughter...

585
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:40,697
we only get part of the money.

586
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:41,865
That's enough,Jackson.

587

If he's cut her ears off,
and we can'tfind them...

588
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:46,745
we'll knock a couple thousand

O'REILLY: Mr. Naville,
I don't think you need to worry.

593
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,464
My partner is simply envisaging
a worst-case scenario.

What about the kidnapper?

595
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,844
You want him,too?

596
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:03,637
That's extra.

597
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,180
What if he gets in the way?

598
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,516
We'll deal with that situation
if it arises.

to get in the way?

Mr. Naville.

someone else will.

and unlimited responsibility.

of the contract.

-Is there a problem?

718
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:04,748
Half a million dollars
isn't a lot of money for me!

It's not meant
to reflect you as an individual.

720
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:10,838
If word got out I was liberated
for half a million...

721
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:14,049

in polite society again.

722

that which is placed upon them.

than I thought!

00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,349

You're trying hard.

You're keen to learn.
That's important.

728

lose sight of the fact...

729
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,357
that we have the opportunity...

730
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,276
to make
millions of dollars here.

731
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:36,864
We?

00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:38,907
Yes, Robert.

733
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,285
You and me.

734
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,454
Is that not a little irregular?

735
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,916
Yes, it is.

736
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,547
Millions?

737
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,883

just give him the money!

If you don't mind me asking...

763
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,195
how did you know
he'd react like that?

764
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:09,905
It's our job
to know things like that.

765
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:11,865
You done
this sort of thing before?

766
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:13,492
Let's go!

767
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:17,120
You can take the car,
but remember, it's stolen.

CELINE: Look,
they weren't trying to kill you.

769
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,382
They were trying to confuse you
and scare you.

770
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,300
ROBERT:
Yeah, before they killed me.

771
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,387
And I lost the car,
and I didn't get any money.

everything right the first time.

Look,you are going to be fine.

774

Do you think so?

No.

00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:57,077
Maybe we should go out.

783

Out where?

784
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:01,540
For a drink.

785
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,626

786
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,879

No, Lily and I,we just...

790

You know,
we just grew apart as people.

791
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,934
There was no bitterness
on either side.

792
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,144
She left you?

793
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,397
No, no, no, no. No!

798
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:36,450
CELINE: You have the demeanor...

799
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,869
of a man who's been left
for an aerobics instructor.

800
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,370
-I do?
-Yeah.

801

CELINE: But be honest.
It was inevitable.

802
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,375
You two weren't suited
for one another.

803
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:47,461
You dream of something better.
She wants it now.

804

-I don't wanna hear it.

a good opportunity...

812
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:09,942
to tell you about my novel.

813

in your novel.

some great mystery, right?

Happy we'll be

Beyond the sea

906
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:37,186
And never again

907
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:41,148
I'll go sailing

908
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,878
Hmm.

909
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:11,261
Oh, my God. What happened?

910
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,680
You were great.

911
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,642
I was?

912
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:17,851
CELINE: Mm-hmm.

913
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:27,277
I remember drinking tequila.

914
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,988
CELINE: Certainly was a feature
of the evening.

915
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,909
ROBERT: Then I had
an incredible dream.

916
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:36,995
This dream, I've had it before.

917
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:38,914
You're definitely in it now.

918
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:40,624
CELINE: I don't want to hear it.

919
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:44,127
ROBERT: We were on this
game show called Perfect Love.

920
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:45,921
CELINE: Never heard of it.

921
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:47,381
ROBERT: Well, it's just a dream.

922
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:49,550
I don't think the fact
that it's a game show...

923
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:50,843
has any relevance.

924
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:53,387
It merely indicates
my cultural origins.

925
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,932
I mean,were I a tribesman
in the Kalahari,for instance...

926
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:00,435
the location would undoubtedly
have been different.

927
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,688
But I think
the theme is universal.

928
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,315
We're on this game show
called Perfect Love.

929
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:07,818

ROBERT: Am I ready for what?

932
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:12,906
CELINE: To write a letter.

933
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,665
Perhaps you'd like to keep this.

934
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:23,166
We had it analyzed.

935
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,419
It's his handwriting
and her blood.

00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,212
JACKSON: Without our help,
Mr. Naville...

937
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,922
that could be the last trace
of your daughter you ever see.

00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:32,426

switch with no delays.

939
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:39,224
-I want her back.
-Don't worry. We'll get her.

940
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:40,392
And I want him dead.

941
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:41,852
That's understood, Mr. Naville.

942
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:43,353
NAVILLE: Good.

943
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:49,359
And when this is over,
I want this back.

944
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:57,701
CELINE:
Bradley was nice,you know?

945
00:51:57,784 --> 00:51:59,786

CELINE: Then there was Jake.

951
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,009
He was nice.

952

Very rich.

953
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,513
Just so conventional.

954
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,431
ROBERT: You see?
Rich guys. Conventional.

955
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:20,599
It's a problem.

956
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:23,018
Then there was Angelo.

957
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,812
Twenty-five years old...

964
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,497
Well, I think
that we just sort of, um...

965
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,334
grew apart as people.

966
00:52:51,755 --> 00:52:53,757

971
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,728
ROBERT: So who was next?

972
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:09,940
CELINE: Then I started getting
problems with my teeth.

973
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,692

974
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:13,652

ROBERT: I know.
It's difficult to explain.

985
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:34,882
Strange things were happening.

986
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:36,884

00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,886

01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,813
But I didn't...

1781
01:35:29,897 --> 01:35:32,065
and here we are.

1782
01:35:32,107 --> 01:35:35,944
Do you have any substantial
evidence to back all this?

1783
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:37,070
None at all.

1784
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:39,907
And you realize
that it's absurd and irrational?

1785
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:41,408
I know that.

1786
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,952
Then why do you believe it?

1787
01:35:43,994 --> 01:35:46,580
Because, Celine, I'm a dreamer.

1788
01:35:48,832 --> 01:35:52,294
Well, I guess
that makes two of us.

1789
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:56,673
Are you ready?

1790
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:58,926
As I'll ever be.

1791
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:01,470
