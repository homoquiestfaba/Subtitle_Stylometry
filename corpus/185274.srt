00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,815
[ Narrator ] ln a time
when one's town was one's world...

2
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,861
and the actions at a dance
excited greater interest...

3
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:54,294
than the movement of armies,

4
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:59,927
there lived a young woman who knew
how this world should be run.

5
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:03,302
The most beautiful thing
in the world is a match well made...

6
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,500
and a happy marriage
to you both.

7
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:10,171
Thank you, Emma. Your painting
grows more accomplished every day.

8
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:12,578
You are very kind,
but it would be all the better...

9
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,413
if I practiced my drawing
more as you urged me.

10
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,419
It's very beautiful.

11
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,148
I should never take side
against you, Miss Woodhouse,

12
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,156
but your friend is right.

13
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,624
It is indeed a job well done.

14
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,459
A job well done, Mr. Elton,
was yours in performing the ceremony.

15
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,624
Must the church be
so drafty, Mr. Elton ?

16
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,964
It is very difficult
to surrender the soul...

17
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,197
when one is worried
about one's throat.

18
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:38,365
Perhaps some tea and cake
would revive you, Mr. Woodhouse ?

19
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,275
Miss Taylor, surely you're
not serving cake at your wedding ?

20
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:46,679
Far too rich. You put us all at peril.
And I am not alone in feeling so.

21
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,651
Where is Mr. Perry, the apothecary ?
He will support me.

22
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,314
He is over there, Mr. Woodhouse,
having some cake.

23
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,450
What ?

24
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:00,257
I have to take Father home.
But dear Miss Taylor--

25
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,264
Oh, no !

26
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:07,167
You are "Dear Miss Taylor" no more !
You are dear Mrs. Weston now.

27
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:10,229
And how happy
this must make you.

28
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,173
Such happiness this brings
to all of us.

29
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,177
My dear Emma !

30
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:29,853
[ Woodhouse ] Poor Miss Taylor.
She was so happy here.

31
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:34,022
Why should she give up being
your governess only to be married ?

32
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:37,156
I am grown now.

33
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,396
She cannot put up
with my ill humors forever.

34
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,837
- She must wish for children of her own.
- You have no ill humors.

35
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:47,035
Your own mother,
God rest her,

36
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,374
could be no more real
than Miss Taylor.

37
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:53,405
Can she truly wish to give life
to a mewling infant...

38
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:57,249
who will import disease
each time it enters the house ?

39
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,348
No ! I said poor Miss Taylor
and poor, indeed, she is.

40
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:07,055
[ Man ] As an old friend of the family
I had to ask as soon as I got back:

41
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,462
Who cried the most
at the wedding ?

42
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:11,727
[ Chuckling ]

43
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,293
And how is my sister ? ls your brother
giving her the respect...

44
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,737
we Woodhouse ladies deserve ?

45
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:21,504
Poor lsabella.
She was the first to leave me.

46
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:24,877
No doubt, that is where
Miss Taylor got the notion to go.

47
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:27,439
Don't be too hard
on Miss Taylor.

48
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,315
It must be easier for her to have
only one to please than two.

49
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,355
Especially when one of us
is such a troublesome creature.

50
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:36,824
- Yes, I am... most troublesome.
- [ Giggles ]

51
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:40,590
Dear Papa,
I could never mean you.

52
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,860
Mr. Knightley loves
to find fault with me, that's all.

53
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,901
It's his idea of a joke.

54
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,802
I'm practically a brother
to you, Emma.

55
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:51,602
Is it not a brother's job
to find fault with his sister ?

56
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,642
But where is the fault with you ?

57
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,010
Emma bears it well. But she is
most sorry to lose Miss Taylor.

58
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,107
We would not like Emma so well
as we do if she did not miss her friend.

59
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,015
Thank you.

60
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,646
I shall miss her so.

61
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,156
I do not know what
I shall do without her.

62
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,658
- She's not far.
- Almost half a mile !

63
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,888
Her obligations are there now.

64
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,795
She cannot sit and talk
with me in the old way,

65
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:19,494
or walk with me,
or urge me to better myself.

66
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,096
That should not matter as you
always did just as you pleased.

67
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:26,903
Yes. But I shall
miss her urging me.

68
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:30,673
She was as selfless a friend
as I have ever had.

69
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,181
I hope to say someday I have done
half as much for someone...

70
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,183
as Mrs. Weston did for me.

71
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,981
You must be happy
that she settled so well.

72
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,487
[ Emma ]
lndeed !

73
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:42,821
One matter of joy in this
is that I made the match myself.

74
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,053
People said Mr. Weston
would never marry again.

75
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,358
- And what a triumph.
- Triumph ?

76
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,991
- You made a lucky guess.
- Have you never known
the triumph of a lucky guess ?

77
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,001
Had I not promoted
Mr. Weston's visits...

78
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,230
and given encouragement
where encouragement was needed,

79
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,569
we might not have had
a wedding today.

80
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,973
Then please, my dear,
encourage no one else.

81
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,604
Marriage is so disrupting
to one's social circle.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,614
Only one more, Papa.

83
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,378
When Mr. Elton
joined their hands today,

84
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:12,478
he looked very much as if he would like
the same kind office performed for him.

85
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,045
[ Sighs ]

86
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:17,559
Invite him for dinner.
That is kindness enough.

87
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:22,189
Mr. Elton is a man of 26.
He knows how to take care of himself.

88
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:25,564
One does not like to generalize about so
many people all at once, Mr. Knightley,

89
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:28,536
but you may be sure that men
know nothing about their hearts...

90
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,938
whether they be six and twenty
or six and eighty.

91
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,976
Excepting you, of course,
Father.

92
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,477
[ Chuckles ]

93
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,014
No.

94
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:42,643
Mr. Elton will be the next person
to benefit from my help.

95
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,119
[ Knightley ]
Poor Miss Taylor, indeed !

96
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,816
It is Mr. Elton
who deserves our pity.

97
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,017
[ Chuckling ]

98
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:56,058
[ Emma ]
Mr. Elton !

99
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,735
Welcome to our party.

100
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:02,327
Miss Woodhouse, thank you indeed
for including me.

101
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:06,535
A party is a party.
But a party on a summer's eve, mmm !

102
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:09,373
It relieves my mind
very much that you are here.

103
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:13,472
For there is someone new in our group.
Her name is Harriet Smith.

104
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:16,382
And she is a former pupil
of Mrs. Goddard's.

105
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,613
I had never met Miss Smith
before this evening...

106
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:21,248
and I'm already struck
by her charm.

107
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:24,122
I wondered
if I might ask you...

108
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:27,594
to make certain she is at ease
throughout the evening.

109
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,792
If helping Miss Smith
would help Miss Woodhouse,

110
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,199
then I'm happy
to be of service.

111
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:35,499
Come.
I shall make the introduction.

112
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:37,869
Miss Woodhouse,
we come quite overpowered.

113
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,001
Oh, Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates.
So happy you could come.

114
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:44,103
[ Miss Bates ]
No ! We are the happy ones.

115
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,705
W-Well, how do you do,
Mr. Elton ?

116
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,775
We are the happy ones,
not only to be here tonight,

117
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,514
but for the beautiful
hindquarter of pork you sent us.

118
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:56,786
It has been heaven itself. What
a happy porker it must have come from !

119
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:00,192
We're so obliged
for your sending it to us.

120
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:03,061
Pork ! And we're so obliged
for your having us tonight.

121
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:06,898
Very much indeed. I was
just saying to Mother, we should
be obliged and indeed we are.

122
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:10,132
Oh, doesn't your hair look pretty ?
Just like an angel.

123
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,697
Angel, Mother !

124
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:16,074
Oh, speaking of angels,
Mr. Elton,

125
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:19,137
your sermon on Daniel in the lion's den
was so inspiring.

126
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:24,380
So powerful in all its particulars.
It left us speechless.

127
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:28,948
Quite speechless, I tell you.
We have not stopped talking of it since.

128
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:31,255
Isn't this a lovely party ?

129
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,854
Lovely ! Lovely ! Lovely !

130
00:09:34,931 --> 00:09:38,423
Where will you live now that
you've completed your education ?

131
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:41,368
Mrs. Goddard has been kind enough
to let me stay on with her.

132
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:45,271
- She's a great help to me.
If you'll excuse me.
- [ Woodhouse ] Mrs. Goddard.

133
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:50,040
- Mr. Knightley.
- Ah, Emma. I wondered where you were.

134
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:54,607
But now I see you've been hard at work
making Mr. Elton comfortable.

135
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,709
Yes, but I've been remiss
in doing the one thing...

136
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:58,720
that shall bring him
the greatest enjoyment.

137
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,915
[ Emma ]
Mr. Elton.

138
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,551
May I present Miss Smith ?

139
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:11,490
Any friend of Miss Woodhouse is--

140
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:23,634
Mr. Weston, have you had
any news of your son ?

141
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,544
Oh, indeed.

142
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,381
Miss Smith, I was married
many years ago...

143
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,852
to a woman whose life
was lost to illness...

144
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:35,982
just three years after
the birth of our son, Frank.

145
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:39,494
As I could not see to my business
and care for the infant,

146
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:42,656
I allowed him to be brought up
by my wife's brother...

147
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,666
and his wife, the Churchills.

148
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:47,430
He lives in London now,
a young man,

149
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:49,437
and has never been here.

150
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:53,236
His aunt is not well and she
does not care to be without him.

151
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,437
His coming would be the final blessing
for our marriage.

152
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:59,538
How lucky to have been
twice blessed in marriage.

153
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:02,277
It has been my belief
that one loves only once.

154
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:05,013
I'm happy to be wrong.

155
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,681
[ Weston ]
Not so happy as l, Miss Smith.

156
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:11,693
I had the most pleasing letter from him
on the occasion of our marriage.

157
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,991
I have it here if anyone
would care to see it.

158
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:18,625
A most charming and kindly letter.
Don't you think so, Mother ?

159
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:21,636
Have, have you ever read
such a letter, Mr. Knightley ?

160
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,400
Do you know, this... this reminds me
of Jane's style somewhat.

161
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,873
It's a very delicate style
which is more usual in a woman,

162
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,877
but a good sign in a man,
I think.

163
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,970
Nicely expressed.

164
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:36,814
But it sounds as though he eats
a worrisome amount of custard.

165
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:39,946
It's not merely
the feeling in it.

166
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,820
The penmanship
is so confident.

167
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:46,157
-Isn't Miss Smith delightful ?
-I watched her with continuous pleasure.

168
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:50,757
She is uncertain in these surroundings,
yet I thought perhaps...

169
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:55,668
I could be of service to her, undertake
her introduction into Highbury society.

170
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:57,899
I could never presume
to guide her as you did me.

171
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,407
Oh !

172
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:01,875
But I might be able to share
a little of what I know.

173
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:04,139
She could ask
for nothing better.

174
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,182
Come, Mr. Weston,
I must write to your son.

175
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,245
Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.

176
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,254
[ Weston ]
Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.

177
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,586
Good night, Emma.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

178
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:21,153
- Good night, Miss Taylor.
- Good night, Mrs. Weston, Mr. Weston.

179
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,289
[ Weston ]
Good night.

180
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:27,325
Poor Miss Taylor.
She so obviously wanted to stay.

181
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:34,870
How interesting, Miss Smith. And what
kind of people are your parents ?

182
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,912
I do not know.

183
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:41,643
Mrs. Goddard has said that I cannot
know them and so I have left it at that.

184
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:45,084
Because of her attentions
over the years, Mrs. Goddard
has been my true guardian.

185
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:48,282
[ Gasps ] Hurry along, dear.
It's Miss Bates coming.

186
00:12:48,357 --> 00:12:50,552
[ Emma ]
As it is Tuesday...

187
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,958
she will have a letter
from her niece Jane Fairfax,

188
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,963
and she will want to
read us every word.

189
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:59,092
- Oh, I do not know Miss Fairfax.
- There's not much to be said for her.

190
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:01,636
When pressed,
I say she is elegant.

191
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,797
[ Miss Bates Giggles ]

192
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:07,309
[ Miss Bates Chatting ]

193
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:11,437
[ Harriet ]
Besides you and Mrs. Goddard,

194
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:15,507
the only other people I know here
are the Martins of Abbey Mill Farm.

195
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:20,817
Mrs. Martin had two parlors
and an upper maid and eight cows !

196
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,054
Mr. Martin used to cut fresh flowers
every day. [ Gasps ]

197
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:29,029
[ Emma ] How lucky for Mrs. Martin
to have such an agreeable husband !

198
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,865
Oh, Miss Woodhouse, Mr. Martin
is not her husband. He is her son.

199
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:37,394
Ahh ! I see.

200
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,772
And he is...

201
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,970
unmarried.

202
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:45,445
Mmm. Though
I cannot understand why.

203
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:48,745
He seems perfect
in every particular.

204
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:52,015
He brought me walnuts once,
and went three miles to get them...

205
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,750
just because he heard me
say I liked them.

206
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:57,315
Wasn't that kind ?
[ Gasps ]

207
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,290
[ Emma ] Tell me more about Mr. Martin.
Is he a man of information ?

208
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,859
[ Harriet ] Oh, yes.
He reads the agricultural reports.

209
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,873
And I recommended he read The Romance
of the Forest, and he said he would.

210
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:14,000
And what sort of looking man
is he ?

211
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:17,477
Mmm. I thought him
very plain at first,

212
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,776
but I do not think so now.

213
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:21,783
Have you never seen him
when he is in town ?

214
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,478
A family like the Martins...

215
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,043
are precisely the sort of people
with whom I have nothing to do.

216
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:29,285
A degree or two lower, and I might
be useful to their families.

217
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,326
But a farmer
needs none of my help...

218
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:34,955
and is therefore as much
above my notice as he is below it.

219
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,023
- In fact--
- Miss Woodhouse, there he is now !

220
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:45,497
- How do I look ?
- Fine, dear.

221
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,906
Good enough I'm sure
for Mr. Martin.

222
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:50,639
Good day. This is a bit
of a chance, isn't it ?

223
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,910
Good day, Mr. Martin. Miss Woodhouse,
may I present Mr. Martin ?

224
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:58,010
- This is Miss Woodhouse.
- Good day. How do you do ?

225
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:02,251
Oh. Were you able to find
The Romance of the Forest ?

226
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:05,259
Oh, blast ! I forgot.

227
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,454
But I go again tomorrow,

228
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,159
and I will make every effort
to get that thought into my head.

229
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,167
How's your mother ?

230
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,033
[ Thinking ] Really, Harriet,
we can do better than this.

231
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:20,239
[ Emma ]
lf you pull this way, dear,

232
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:22,971
you'll find it makes
a neater stitch.

233
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,879
Of course !

234
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,778
May I ask what you thought
of my friend, Robert Martin ?

235
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,881
Well, dear,

236
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,984
I imagined him
a degree nearer gentility.

237
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:44,460
True. He's not so genteel
as Mr. Knightley, but--

238
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,966
No !

239
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,663
Not one in a hundred men
has "gentleman"...

240
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,672
so plainly written across him
as Mr. Knightley.

241
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,269
But let us judge him next to
another man. Oh, say... Mr. Elton.

242
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:59,507
Mr. Elton is a fine man.

243
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,312
Thoughtful in ways
Mr. Martin can never be.

244
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,319
Miss Woodhouse, whatever his faults,
Mr. Martin is thoughtful.

245
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,082
I see.

246
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:11,820
Did he take your advice and get
the book you asked him to read ?

247
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:16,128
Um--

248
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,463
Well... no.

249
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:21,867
Yes.

250
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,962
Yes !

251
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,439
I wonder that he
did not remember it.

252
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,909
Oh, well.

253
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:35,676
Mr. Elton said something very kind
about you the other day.

254
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:39,313
- Can you not tell me what it was ?
- Oh !

255
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:43,552
It is not my place to intrude
in personal matters.

256
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:56,134
But, as your friend, I could
make an exception if you wish.

257
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,742
[ Elton ] Miss Smith
was always a beautiful creature.

258
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:11,047
But the attractions
you have added are far superior.

259
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,452
Oh, I have done very little.

260
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,922
If it were admissible
to contradict a lady--

261
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:19,188
I cannot take credit for her beauty,
nor her sweetness, nor--

262
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:23,527
An idea has just dropped into my mind,
surely from heaven itself.

263
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,295
What if you were to exercise
your artistic talents...

264
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:28,734
and draw a portrait
of Miss Smith ?

265
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,999
How I would love
to watch you draw her.

266
00:17:31,073 --> 00:17:33,633
Mr. Elton, my skills
are slender indeed,

267
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:36,371
and we must not forget
how shy Miss Smith is.

268
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:37,878
Oh.

269
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:41,883
Do you think it would help
if I asked her to pose ?

270
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,593
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
may I look, please ?

271
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,428
I cannot wait another second.

272
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:05,629
Incredible.

273
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,474
You have expressed her
completely.

274
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,570
Mr. Elton, really !

275
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,808
You exaggerate.

276
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:17,318
[ Elton ]
lndeed, I do not. Nor cannot.

277
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,786
The reason I have not done
a portrait in so long...

278
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:22,119
is because the spouse
always complains.

279
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:26,787
As there are no husbands or wives here,
I trust I may proceed safely.

280
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:33,258
No husbands or wives...
at present, Miss Woodhouse.

281
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:43,607
You've made her too tall.

282
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:50,282
It... may not be Miss Smith's height
in terms of measurement,

283
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:53,082
but it is surely the height
of her character.

284
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,018
My dear, I would paint
a shawl on her...

285
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:06,557
as one can't help feeling
that she will catch cold.

286
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,866
Otherwise,
it is quite splendid.

287
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,304
It only wants a suitable frame.

288
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:14,899
We will have to get it to London.

289
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:18,276
Might I be entrusted
with such a commission ?

290
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:21,578
I would be gratified
more than words can express.

291
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:29,183
[ People Chatting, Cows Mooing,
Sheep Bleating ]

292
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:33,693
[ Tapping ]

293
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,336
He wants to marry me !
Would you mind reading this ?

294
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:54,212
Certainly not !
I cannot believe Mr. Elton proposed !

295
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:58,379
- He surely is--
- Not Mr. Elton. Mr. Martin, my friend !

296
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:07,862
Is it a good letter
or too... short ?

297
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,955
It is a good letter !

298
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:12,865
One of his sisters
must have helped him.

299
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,870
Yet, it is not in the style
of a woman.

300
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,704
Well, it is a good letter,
and you must answer it immediately.

301
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:22,573
He must have his disappointment
and move on.

302
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:26,546
Well, you think
I should refuse him ?

303
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:30,107
You did not plan to return an answer
favorable to this claim ?

304
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,483
No, I did not.

305
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,455
That is, I did not mean--

306
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:39,517
Um, well... I was not sure.
That is why I came to you.

307
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:42,894
- It's not my place to intrude !
- I depend so on what you think.

308
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:46,196
I would not advise you
for the world !

309
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,972
If you prefer Mr. Martin to every
other person you know, or may ever know,

310
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,100
if you think him the most agreeable man
you have ever been...

311
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:59,375
or ever will be in company with,
then why should you hesitate ?

312
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:07,088
But if you'll not influence me,
I must do as well as I can by myself.

313
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:09,090
So--

314
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,129
Well, I am determined to.

315
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:18,292
And I have really almost
made up my mind to...

316
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:23,894
refuse Mr. Martin ?

317
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,372
Oh, do you think that's right
or wrong ? ls it wrong ?

318
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:30,435
Now that you have decided, I will share
the feelings I kept you in suspense of.

319
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,742
I think you are perfectly right.

320
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:35,375
Yes. But--

321
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,249
Oh, dear, it will make
his mother and sisters most unhappy.

322
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,515
Let us think of
other mothers and sisters...

323
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,217
who may be more cheerfully
employed at this moment.

324
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:47,023
I believe Mr. Elton is showing your
picture to his mother and sisters...

325
00:21:47,095 --> 00:21:51,828
telling them how the subject
is more beautiful than the portrait.

326
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,768
If he shows it, I am sure
it is only to praise your artistry.

327
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:59,274
If you are sure,
then you are surely wrong.

328
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:02,538
By showing it to them,
he is revealing his deeper intentions...

329
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:06,274
which may produce a letter
of his own.

330
00:22:07,449 --> 00:22:09,383
Oh !

331
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,783

Very well, I admit it.

He's a tenant, you know,

He asked whether it would be
imprudent of him to settle so early.

to marry,

The most incomprehensible
thing in the world to a man...

his offer of marriage.

Would you let me
walk with you ?

502
00:32:48,656 --> 00:32:51,716
Dear, must we walk
so quickly ?

503
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,921
- Mum said I should hurry.
- Would you like to play a game ?

504
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:57,829
- Do you mean it ?
- I do. I swear I do.

505
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,595
- Oh, it's too wonderful !
- I love--

506
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:04,126
[ Thinking ]
Can this be ? The declaration ?

507
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:08,107
I simply love...
celery root !

508
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:10,371
[ Elton ] And what
should they be serving but...

509
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:13,278
[ Together Laughing ]
celery root !

510
00:33:19,487 --> 00:33:22,081
[ Woodhouse ]
Emma, be careful ! The baby !

511
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:26,253
It might have an infection.

512
00:33:26,327 --> 00:33:29,160
- This may be the finest Knightley yet.
- Thank you.

513
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,721
You and lsabella should
have brought her sooner.

514
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,427
And she looks so fetching
in the arms of her aunt.

515
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:36,595
[ John ] Yes, don't they make
a splendid pair ?

516
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:39,139
[ Woodhouse ]
The journey from London, how was it ?

517
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:42,040
If you accepted adults with
as little whim as you do these children,

518
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,044
we might always agree.

519
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,273
How fascinating that
any discordancy between us...

520
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,907
must always arise
from my being wrong.

521
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,975
Not fascinating,
but true.

522
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,385
Perhaps it has something to do
with the gap in our ages.

523
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,923
I was 16 years old
when you were born.

524
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,425
Undoubtedly
you're my superior then.

525
00:33:59,494 --> 00:34:02,463
But hasn't the lapse of 21 years
closed the gap ?

526
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,794
Narrowed it.

527
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,391
[ Laughing ]

528
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:11,666
Come, dear Emma, let us be friends
and quarrel no more.

529
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,673
Very well.

530
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:17,507
And might I say that we were both right
as far as good intentions went.

531
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,207
I only hope Mr. Martin
was not too disappointed.

532
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:23,341
Hmm.
No man could be more so.

533
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:25,545
I'm very sorry.

534
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,556
Come...
shake hands with me.

535
00:34:33,194 --> 00:34:35,526
- [ Charles ] Dinner is served.
- [ Woodhouse ] Good.

536
00:34:35,597 --> 00:34:37,292
John.

537
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:42,962
Sister, dear, when shall we meet
your new friend, Miss Smith ?

538
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:46,632
She will be with us on Friday
at the Weston's Christmas Eve party.

539
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:50,735
It looks as though it will be
a very rewarding holiday for her.

540
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:09,594
[ Elton ] I am so looking forward
to this evening.

541
00:35:09,664 --> 00:35:13,259
A party is a party,
but a Christmas party !

542
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:20,468
Where is Miss Smith ?

543
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:24,074
I have some sad news.

544
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:27,842
Miss Smith is ill and cannot
be with us this evening.

545
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:31,942
Sad loss to our party.

546
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,615
She will be missed
at every moment.

547
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:45,095
However, I feel,
and I hope you will concur...

548
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,430
that small parties are the best.

549
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:49,800
I would rather fall short by two
than exceed by two.

550
00:35:49,871 --> 00:35:52,772
And how fortunate...

551
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,809
that the snow comes now
instead of yesterday when it might
have made our party impossible.

552
00:35:55,877 --> 00:36:00,337
Now that would have been a real cause
for sadness, would it not ?

553
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,215
- Yes, would you like a whiskey ?
- Not at the moment.

554
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,281
Oh, thank you, thank you, yes.

555
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,489
Weather of this severity
is no friend of mine, I fear.

556
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:18,088
I know that too well,
Mr. Woodhouse.

557
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:24,628
My son Frank has written
and told us something most exciting.

558
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:28,039
- Miss Woodhouse, are you warm enough ?
- Yes, thank you.

559
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:31,135
- When did you receive his news ?
- The letter arrived today.

560
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:35,546
And on the opening we had the most
wonderful surprise. Frank said--

561
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:38,710
Some of the other ladies were saying
they were not warm enough.

562
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:41,084
I am quite comfortable.
Yes.

563
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:44,716
I saw how close you were to the fire and
thought perhaps you might be too warm.

564
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:49,252
Mr. Elton, I am in
the perfect state of warmness.

565
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,628
[ Weston ] At first
I could not believe it,

566
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:55,032
so I asked Mrs. Weston
to read the letter herself...

567
00:36:55,103 --> 00:36:59,233
to make sure I was not dreaming,
but indeed Frank said--

568
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,105
Miss Woodhouse, is there
any effort I might make...

569
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,644
on behalf of your father's comfort ?

570
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:08,705
You are very kind, but I can only
imagine that he's quite comfortable.

571
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,411
Thank you for being
so thoughtful.

572
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:16,150
No. Thank you
for thinking I am thoughtful.

573
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:20,459
I wondered if perhaps...

574
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:24,020
you might be so kind
as to bring me some punch ?

575
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:27,329
I only hope I can complete
the task quickly enough.

576
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:31,862
Please... I could not enjoy it
if I knew that you had hurried.

577
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:35,902
[ Miss Bates ]
Thrilling. Simply thrilling news.

578
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:38,639
- And that was the end of the letter.
- [ Sighs ]

579
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:41,978
[ Miss Bates ] Cranberry, Mother.
It will soon be spring.

580
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:45,450
Emma, I'm not sure I had
your attention earlier...

581
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,488
with others so desirous
of your company,

582
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:51,252
but I wanted to tell you
that Frank is coming at last.

583
00:37:51,325 --> 00:37:53,555
I so look forward
to meeting him,

584
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,653
that is if you can bear
to share him.

585
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,598
That is if his aunt will share him
with us. That's what this depends on.

586
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,227
She has said yes,
but has not given a date.

587
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:06,000
Very prudent. This weather is by no
means clement for the traveler abroad.

588
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:08,974
Oh, no. No, no, no.

589
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,520
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- No.

590
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:25,218
But I cannot stop thinking
of Miss Smith's condition.

591
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,693
She will be happy to know
of your concern.

592
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,730
How could I
not be concerned ?

593
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:33,392
The whole situation
is most alarming.

594
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,595
There is nothing worse
than a sore throat.

595
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,070
Its effects
are exceedingly bleak.

596
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:40,073
And that is why I must,

597
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:42,336
in the presence of your friend,
ask you to stop visiting her.

598
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,742
- What ?
- You are putting yourself at risk...

599
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:47,110
and we cannot allow that,
can we, Knightley ?

600
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:51,413
- I mean, is this fair ?
- [ Woodhouse Coughs ]

601
00:38:51,486 --> 00:38:54,250
Have I not some right
to complain ?

602
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:57,155
[ John ] Emma, the weather's
distressing your father.

603
00:38:57,225 --> 00:39:00,592
He wants to leave. Isabella and I
will take him home now in our carriage.

604
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:02,686
- Will you--
- Not to worry, sir.

605
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:05,357
- I will insure that
your sister-in-law is safe.
- Thank you.

606
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:09,202
[ Mrs. Weston ]
Mr. Weston ?

607
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,673
Come, Mr. Woodhouse.
Let's wrap you up warmly.

608
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:32,120
- Certainly the weather has--
- Miss Woodhouse, please !

609
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:35,026
- Fate has left us alone for a reason.
- Release my hand !

610
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:38,224
I do not seize your hand so much as
the opportunity to declare that l--

611
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,201
- Good heavens, go back !
- Please.

612
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,738
I am hoping--

613
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:47,433
No, fearing--

614
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,001
Ready to die
if you refuse me.

615
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:53,046
Surely my ardent attachment
to you,

616
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:56,379
my love and passion cannot help
but have made an impression, and now--

617
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,817
- Mr. Elton, this is l, Miss Woodhouse.
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,321
The party spirit
has confused you.

619
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,689
I am happy to deliver
your message to Miss Smith.

620
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,321
- You must direct no more of it to me.
- Miss Smith ?

621
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:13,026
What sort of message would I want
to send to her ? [ Laughing ]

622
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,898
- Miss Smith ?
- Mr. Elton, the wine has weakened you.

623
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,872
If the wine has had any effect,
it has been to strengthen my will
to tell you I love you !

624
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,774
My astonishment is beyond
anything I can express.

625
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:26,006
For you to address me in this manner
after your behavior to Miss Smith--

626
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,344
I never cared whether Miss Smith
were dead or alive,

627
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,543
except that she was your friend.

628
00:40:30,618 --> 00:40:33,746
Who can think of Miss Smith
when Miss Woodhouse is near ?

629
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:36,051
Oh, no.

630
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:40,423
Everything I have said or done
has been to prove my adoration for you.

631
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:43,019
Why else would I go to London
to have your picture framed ?

632
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:45,224
[ Groans ]

633
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:54,698
[ Whispering ]
Allow me to--

634
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:58,176
Allow me to interpret the silence.
You have long understood me.

635
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:02,773
Sit back and kindly refrain
from the intimacy of whispering !

636
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,411
Am I to understand that you never sought
to recommend yourself to Miss Smith ?

637
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:10,082
How can you be surprised ? Did you
not understand the riddle I wrote ?

638
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:12,387
That was for Harriet !

639
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,590
I most obviously did not address it
to her, and left it at your home.

640
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:18,427
But-- Oh.

641
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:22,595
She's a very good sort of girl. I'm sure
there are men who would not object to--

642
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:26,402
Everybody has their level.

643
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:28,999
But I need not so totally despair
of an equal alliance...

644
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,203
as to address myself
to Miss Smith.

645
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:33,178
- Sir.
- No !

646
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:36,045
I sought to recommend myself
to you through those visits.

647
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,585
Sir, I have seen you only
as the admirer of my friend.

648
00:41:38,653 --> 00:41:40,587
I cannot believe that.

649
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,782
- It is well that the mistake
ends where it does.
- It is her mistake.

650
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:45,417
- It is mine as well.
- She will manage her disappointment.

651
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:47,757
Leave her out of it.

652
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:52,931
How do you feel
about what I have said ?

653
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:56,336
Mr. Elton,

654
00:41:56,404 --> 00:42:00,238
any hopes I had with regard to you
were for Harriet...

655
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:02,502
and Harriet alone.

656
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:37,438
- [ Door Opens, Closes ]
- My dear child.

657
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:43,547
- What is it ?
- Oh, Miss Taylor-- Mrs. Weston.

658
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:51,418
There has been an overthrow of
everything I've been wishing for...

659
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,426
for Harriet and Mr. Elton.

660
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:58,496
A development most unwelcome,
most painful.

661
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,093
Oh, dear !

662
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:04,831
You will not believe it,
but...

663
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:09,171
Mr. Elton,
now prepare yourself, but--

664
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:12,542
Mr. Elton
is in love with you.

665
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:14,581
You knew ?

666
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:18,778
I had my suspicions,
but the party confirmed it.

667
00:43:18,853 --> 00:43:21,879
The worst of it is that I
persuaded her to care for him.

668
00:43:21,956 --> 00:43:27,121
Had I not done that, I could bear
anything, but it was I and I alone.

669
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:30,595
- Even Mr. Knightley warned me.
- Mr. Knightley ?

670
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:34,498
He was very cross because
I had urged Harriet to reject
a proposal from Robert Martin.

671
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:37,628
- That nice farmer ?
- At least there I was right.

672
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,866
Well done, Emma !

673
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,137
But otherwise I have made
a dreadful mistake.

674
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,842
I sought to bring two people together
and I shall never do it again. Never !

675
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,043
[ Sighs ]
That poor girl.

676
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,484
She'll recover.
She's young.

677
00:43:53,554 --> 00:43:56,921
I wish I could ease the pain
of this for her, but I have no idea
who might be right for her.

678
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:58,583
- William Coxe ?
- Emma !

679
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,183
Too pert ?

680
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:04,197
My dear, you said you would never
try to match anyone again.

681
00:44:04,265 --> 00:44:07,723
Yes. Indeed.

682
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:11,829
I just wish there were some way I
could soften the news when I tell her.

683
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:15,933
I'm afraid the best way is always
the most straightforward.

684
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,001
Yes.

685
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:23,014
I suppose I'll just say,
"Harriet--"

686
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,712
I have some news
about Mr. Elton.

687
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:30,247
He--

688
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,220
- He's had to leave town.
- Why ?

689
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:37,230
In his letter to Father,

690
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:40,495
he wrote he is going to Bath
to relax and meet new people.

691
00:44:42,736 --> 00:44:46,729
And this brings me
to something most unpleasant.

692
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:51,176
Miss Woodhouse, nothing you could
ever say would be unpleasant.

693
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:56,512
This is, for I must acknowledge
myself grossly mistaken...

694
00:44:56,584 --> 00:45:00,953
on the one subject which
has occupied us for some time past.

695
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,983
Mr. Elton ?

696
00:45:10,598 --> 00:45:14,591
While expressing his fervent
admiration for you as a person,

697
00:45:14,668 --> 00:45:18,297
it is unhappily I
who have captured his fancy.

698
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:20,499
Naturally I do not return
the feelings,

699
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:22,769
but that does not make it
any less of an embarrassment.

700
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:27,280
And I place the responsibility
for this directly on my own shoulders.

701
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:29,282
Oh, no !

702
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:35,855
I have always felt that I did not
deserve Mr. Elton's affections...

703
00:45:35,923 --> 00:45:40,656
so I cannot blame him
for believing the same.

704
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:43,026
And I could never blame you,

705
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:47,124
for only so kind a friend would
have ever dreamed it possible.

706
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:51,064
Harriet,

707
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:55,438
I had always hoped that I might
have something to teach you.

708
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:01,106
Now I see I should be lucky
to resemble you in any small way.

709
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:12,556
They have just been weaned.
I thought you might enjoy them.

710
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:14,856
They cannot help
but lift the spirits.

711
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:17,989
Do you suppose Mr. Elton is meeting
young ladies while he is away ?

712
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:20,761
I do not know.
Feel her paws.

713
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:23,394
I would not blame him.

714
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,461
I wonder when he will return.

715
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:30,238
Dear, you must try to empty your mind
of Mr. Elton, really.

716
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:35,044
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
It was kind of you to invite me.

717
00:46:35,115 --> 00:46:38,141
Look at her eyes !

718
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:44,246
Mr. Elton had brown eyes too.

719
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,850
- [ Crying ]
- Oh ! Harriet,

720
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:51,955
there is only one place I
can think of where you will not
be able to speak of Mr. Elton.

721
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,966
Indeed, you may not
be able to speak at all.

722
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:58,061
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
what a special, special treat !

723
00:46:58,138 --> 00:47:03,667
It's so lovely of you to come
and visit us. Isn't it, Mother. Treat ?

724
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:07,305
[ Miss Bates ] But the best of it is,
the best of it is...

725
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:10,817
that we were just speaking of a topic
that would interest you both.

726
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:14,877
[ Thinking ] Please do not let it be
a letter from that ninny Jane Fairfax.

727
00:47:14,955 --> 00:47:19,449
[ Miss Bates ] Yes, here it is,
a letter from Mrs. Cole...

728
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,960
who has news of Mr. Elton !
[ Giggles ]

729
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,963
Um, now.

730
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:27,000
Yes, here we are.
"He has been the toast...

731
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:30,332
of every young lady's eye."

732
00:47:30,404 --> 00:47:32,668
[ Miss Bates ] Of course that can
be of no surprise to any of us.

733
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,676
Oh dear, Miss Smith, you look pale.
You must be hungry.

734
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:40,043
Let me get you some cake.
Isn't it nice to have visitors, Mother ?

735
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:43,914
[ Miss Bates Laughs ]
The most amusing thing just happened.

736
00:47:43,984 --> 00:47:48,614
Mother was asking about Jane Fairfax,
asking if there was any news from her,

737
00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:51,522
even though she said she knew
it was not Jane's day for writing.

738
00:47:51,592 --> 00:47:54,925
Remember, Mother ? Not Jane's day !
Oh, napkin. Sorry.

739
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:58,829
You see, we always have a letter
from Jane on Tuesdays,

740
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:02,391
and today, as you must know,
is Thursday.

741
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:07,168
So I said, "Mother, we have had
a letter from Jane this very morning."

742
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,836
And Mother said,
"But it's Thursday !" [ Giggles ]

743
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:14,472
Well, you see, Jane writes on Tuesdays
and this is Thursday.

744
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,644
And, um, I said,
"Upon my honor !"

745
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,983
[ Giggling ]

746
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:26,219
Here you are, Miss-- Oh, napkin.
Sorry. There you are.

747
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:31,424
And might you summarize the letter
in your own delightful words ?

748
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:33,989
Oh, and cheat you out of the pleasure
of hearing it, Miss Woodhouse,

749
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:36,002
as only Jane can put things ?

750
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,699
Upon my honor, I would not.
Where's that letter ? Yes, here it is.

751
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:43,641
[ Miss Bates ]
Um, and now. Oh, yes.

752
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,111
The bad news is she has a cold.

753
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,614
Oh, no !

754
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:53,745
Oh, yes. But the good news
far outweighs it. Far, far, far !

755
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:55,755
She is coming to visit !

756
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:59,953
You must be here to help us with her,
Miss Woodhouse, when she comes...

757
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:02,257
because it wouldn't
be a proper visit otherwise.

758
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:06,732
You must sit right where you are.
And, and you must say--

759
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,566
We are so glad
to have you with us.

760
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:12,537
How were you able
to get away ?

761
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:15,074
The Campbells have gone
to lreland on a holiday.

762
00:49:15,142 --> 00:49:18,976
So I've come here, which
is better than any holiday.

763
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:23,345
[ Thinking ] Mmm.
She is more giving than I expected.

764
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:26,944
Tell Miss Woodhouse
whom you saw in Weymouth.

765
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,615
Frank Churchill. That's whom she saw.
Mr. Frank Churchill !

766
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:34,286
Oh, we hear much of him, but have
never seen him. Was he handsome ?

767
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:36,761
Many say he is.

768
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:40,493
- Was he agreeable ?
- He was in no way disagreeable.

769
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:43,627
Was he a man of information ?

770
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:46,138
All his statements
seemed correct.

771
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:49,664
[ Thinking ]
I take it back. She is--

772
00:49:49,743 --> 00:49:52,143
Absolutely impossible !

773
00:49:52,212 --> 00:49:55,443
She wouldn't tell me anything
about Frank Churchill.

774
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,213
Why should you care so much
about Frank Churchill ?

775
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:03,984
I was merely being sociable,
that's all, and she was not.

776
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:09,489
Perhaps you dislike her because
she divides our attentions from you.

777
00:50:09,563 --> 00:50:12,691
[ Laughs ] Really, Mr. Knightley,
you are so comical.

778
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:16,133
You ought to perform
in the town square.

779
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:19,604
Oh, I have some news.
And I know how you like news.

780
00:50:19,673 --> 00:50:23,074
Oh, yes !
I always like news.

781
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:25,805
Mr. Elton
is going to marry.

782
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,314
I don't know what to say,
except that I am--

783
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:37,323
In a state
of complete shock !

784
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:39,416
- You've heard ?
- About what ?

785
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:42,553
Oh ! Never mind.

786
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:45,598
[ Harriet ]
I was on my way here for our visit.

787
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:50,035
It started raining, so I ducked
into Ford's to wait it out.

788
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:52,936
- Miss Smith.
- Miss Smith.

789
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:56,203
Good day, Mr. Ford,
Mr. Ford.

790
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:59,143
[ Harriet Continues ] As I admired
some fabric, who should come in...

791
00:50:59,213 --> 00:51:03,115
but Elizabeth Martin
and her brother.

792
00:51:03,183 --> 00:51:07,176
I thought I should have fainted.
They saw me and began whispering.

793
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:10,587
- [ Gasps ]
- And then, oh, Miss Woodhouse,

794
00:51:10,657 --> 00:51:16,220
I really could not believe this.
She came up to me and spoke ! She said--

795
00:51:16,296 --> 00:51:19,561
I'm sorry we never meet now.

796
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:22,966
- And I said--
- You are too kind.

797
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:27,032
Then I saw that he,
Mr. Martin,

798
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:30,543
my Mr. Martin,
was coming toward me.

799
00:51:30,611 --> 00:51:34,308
- Good day, Miss Smith.
- Good day, Mr. Martin.

800
00:51:34,381 --> 00:51:38,044
I managed to read The Romance
of the Forest. It was very good.

801
00:51:38,118 --> 00:51:42,282
Finally I said I had to go.
But then he followed me.

802
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:44,824
I was not three steps outside
and he said--

803
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,950
Miss Smith !

804
00:51:49,196 --> 00:51:52,256
You better go
by Mr. Cole's stable.

805
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:54,994
The near way is flooded.

806
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:59,001
Thank you.

807
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:02,974
[ Sighs ] Miss Woodhouse,
do talk and make me comfortable again.

808
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:06,012
[ Thinking ] I suppose this
would not be the right time...

809
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,741
to mention that Mr. Elton
is engaged.

810
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:11,477
This was awkward because
it was the first time...

811
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:14,816
- you've seen Mr. Martin
since refusing his proposal.
- No.

812
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:19,848
You, and I must say he,
behaved very well !

813
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:23,123
Now, the kindest thing
you can do for yourself...

814
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:27,758
is to put Mr. Martin
out of your head for good.

815
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:31,564
Yes, I will.

816
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:36,607
I shall do so immediately.

817
00:52:36,677 --> 00:52:39,475
- He's behind me now. [ Giggles ]
- Wonderful !

818
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:42,140
I thought I might sketch the puppies.
Would you join me ?

819
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:44,877
Oh, yes, please !

820
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,751
It was awfully kind of him
to warn me about the flooding.

821
00:52:48,822 --> 00:52:52,223
- Yes, dear.
- He got his coat wet
coming out to tell me.

822
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:56,422
That's the coat Mrs. Martin
gave him for his birthday.

823
00:52:57,664 --> 00:53:00,360
I do hope he does not catch cold.

825
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:24,017

[ Laughing ]

827
00:53:36,436 --> 00:53:39,701
Is your horse just washing his feet or
are there darker forces at work here ?

The latter, I'm afraid.

00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,374
Something has happened
to the wheel and I cannot move.

830
00:53:46,446 --> 00:53:49,313
You'll just have to live here then.
Bye, bye.

831
00:53:58,325 --> 00:54:00,293
I suppose that won't do.

832
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,760
I'll help you home.

833
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:08,667
Thank you so much, Mr.--

834
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:10,726

Frank Churchill.

835
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:14,535
A name I know as well as my own
so long I have heard it spoken.

836
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,974
Your father's wife
was my governess.

837
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:19,568
Then you are Miss Woodhouse !

838
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,979
How delightful.
I, I hear of nothing but you.

839
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:26,075
The last I heard from Mrs. Weston,
you were not due 'til tomorrow.

840
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:30,749
It is always a pleasure to come in on
one's friends before the lookout begins.

841
00:54:30,824 --> 00:54:33,315
I would not presume to do so
in most cases,

842
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:35,861
but I felt in coming home,
I might be forgiven.

843
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:37,794
Then you have not seen them ?

844
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:41,459
We shall have to go there first.
They will be overjoyed.

845
00:54:41,535 --> 00:54:44,595
Overjoyed, I think,
that we are both there together.

846
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:46,696
As I am.

847
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:52,572
Oh, Miss Woodhouse,
have you heard ?

848
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:56,082
- Frank Churchill is here !
- Yes ! ln fact...

849
00:54:56,149 --> 00:54:58,117
- I met him yesterday.
- No ?

850
00:54:58,185 --> 00:55:00,244
Yes. He did me quite
a service when my horse--

851
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,788
Is he handsome ?
ls he everything everyone says he is ?

852
00:55:02,856 --> 00:55:06,348
I have not yet seen him myself,
though, um, Jane saw him...

853
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:09,987
and she said he was
not at all unpleasant to look at.

854
00:55:10,063 --> 00:55:12,623
I suppose I shan't see him
until the Cole's party...

855
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:15,031
which seems like
such an age from now.

856
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:18,036
But I'm sure, simply sure,
will be upon us before...

857
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:21,665
well, we are sufficiently prepared.
[ Giggles ]

858
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:24,676
Has an invitation arrived
for a party at the Cole's ?

859
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:26,678
No, thank heaven !

860
00:55:26,746 --> 00:55:30,807
The Coles are nice people, but we
should have to go outside to get there.

861
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,751
Of course we shall have to decline
as they are beneath us.

862
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,448
But I don't wish them
to hope falsely.

863
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:45,063
[ Footsteps ]

864
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:48,123
- Has James brought the letters yet ?
- I don't know.

865
00:55:48,201 --> 00:55:51,637
I never pay any attention
to the mail.

866
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:07,316
Why do they not write ?

867
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:09,651
Perhaps they know
I must reject them.

868
00:56:09,723 --> 00:56:11,850
Still, as close friends
of the Westons,

869
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:14,792
they should have the courtesy
to extend the invitation.

870
00:56:14,861 --> 00:56:18,388
Unless they don't want me.
But I cannot--

871
00:56:18,465 --> 00:56:22,526
Tell you how delighted I am
to have been invited, Mrs. Cole.

872
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:27,603
- [ Churchill ] lsn't it handsome ?
- Thank you.

873
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:30,802
But from today there's
a much prettier one in town.

874
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:34,278
- It has been sent to Jane Fairfax.
- Really ? Who sent it to her ?

875
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:38,681
That's the exciting part ! There was
no identification of the donor.

876
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:42,051
- Must be from Colonel Campbell.
- Jane's parents died.

877
00:56:42,122 --> 00:56:45,649
And the Bates, of course, are quite
without the resources to, you know.

878
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,989
And Colonel Campbell was
a great friend of her father's,

879
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:50,222
so he and his family
have raised her.

880
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,322
Well, then they must have sent it.

881
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:56,358
Jane has just had a letter from them,
and not a word was said of it.

882
00:56:56,436 --> 00:56:58,370
Perhaps it's a surprise.

883
00:56:58,438 --> 00:57:01,669
We expect Miss Fairfax soon.
Perhaps she may know more.

884
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:05,644
Why do you smile ?

885
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:08,044
I'm smiling because I wonder
if there's anyone else...

886
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:11,277
whom we should suspect of being
Miss Fairfax's musical patron ?

887
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:14,752
- Do you know her ?
- Oh, yes, she's very elegant. Yes.

888
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:18,257
Colonel Campbell's daughter, Mrs. Dixon,
is Miss Fairfax's dearest friend,

889
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:20,816
so perhaps Mrs. Dixon
sent the piano.

890
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:22,862
Mrs. Dixon ?
That makes sense.

891
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:25,762
As much sense do you think
as Mr. Dixon ?

892
00:57:25,832 --> 00:57:28,596
I cannot help suspecting that
after his proposal to Miss Campbell,

893
00:57:28,668 --> 00:57:31,136
a sweet
but rather a plain girl,

894
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:34,173
Mr. Dixon fell in love with Miss Fairfax
who is, after all--

895
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,606
Very elegant, yes.
But what makes you say that ?

896
00:57:36,676 --> 00:57:38,667
Well, she must think so too.

897
00:57:38,745 --> 00:57:41,908
That is why she did not go
on the holiday with the Campbells.

898
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:44,917
Instead she came here.
Do you see ?

899
00:57:44,985 --> 00:57:48,318
Now that Mr. Dixon has married into
the Campbells, he would have been there.

900
00:57:48,388 --> 00:57:51,755
I think that in coming here,
Miss Fairfax was telling Mr. Dixon...

901
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:53,793
that she wanted to forget him.

902
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:59,298
And I think with the pianoforte,
Mr. Dixon wasn't allowing her to.

903
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:04,633
[ Mrs. Cole ] Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates,
do come in. Welcome to our house.

904
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,638
Of course it's just a theory.

905
00:58:06,706 --> 00:58:10,802
But let us see how she reacts at some
time if we say the name, Mr. Dixon.

906
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:18,775
My dear, do you know how Miss Bates
and Jane Fairfax came here tonight ?

907
00:58:18,852 --> 00:58:21,844
Mr. Knightley
sent his carriage.

908
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:24,219
Well, yes, he's very kind.

909
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,782
You give him credit for more
disinterested benevolence than l.

910
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:31,490
A suspicion has darted into my head
which I simply cannot get rid of.

911
00:58:31,564 --> 00:58:34,829
Mr. Knightley and
Jane Fairfax are a couple.

912
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:39,565
[ Laughs ] Mrs. Weston, do not
take to matchmaking. You do it ill.

913
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:43,405
Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley ?
Every feeling revolts !

914
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,444
- Apart from every other--
- [ Mrs. Weston ] Oh, my goodness !

915
00:58:45,512 --> 00:58:48,310
What if the pianoforte
is from Mr. Knightley ?

916
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:53,341
You have taken up an idea and run wild
with it. He is not even with her.

917
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,878
[ Emma ]
She is with Frank, poor man.

918
00:58:56,956 --> 00:59:01,393
Perhaps the two of them stay apart
publicly to keep it a secret.

Here comes-- Mr. Cole !

the honor of trying our pianoforte ?

01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,185
I think you can hardly be without
suspicion that I have developed...

992
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:07,198
certain feelings for someone
of a most tender and devoted nature,

993
01:04:07,266 --> 01:04:10,326
which so far
I have striven to hide.

994
01:04:10,403 --> 01:04:13,304
Yet you have always made me feel
so wonderfully at ease,

995
01:04:13,373 --> 01:04:15,967
such a friend,
since my very arrival...

996
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:19,443
that it not longer seems honorable
to keep them from you.

997
01:04:19,512 --> 01:04:21,878
In short, Miss Woodhouse,
I cannot help but say to you--

998
01:04:21,948 --> 01:04:23,813
[ Charles ]
Mr. Weston.

999
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:30,645
[ Churchill ] Mrs. Weston
has promised to correspond.

1000
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:34,159
The blessings of a female correspondent
when one wants news.

1001
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:36,457
In her letters
I shall be at Highbury,

1002
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:39,896
and here again... with you.

1003
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:45,828
[ Emma Thinking ]
Well, he loves me.

1004
01:04:45,905 --> 01:04:50,103
He was on the verge of telling me
when his father burst in.

1005
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:53,077
I felt listless after he left
and had some sort of headache,

1006
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:56,343
so I must be in love as well.

1007
01:04:56,416 --> 01:05:00,147
I must confess I expected love
to feel somewhat different than this.

1008
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:05,780
I may determine how deep a love
I feel through his absence.

1009
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:09,919
How I wish he would be here tomorrow
because there is a grim job to be done.

1010
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:14,924
Mr. Elton is bringing
his new wife to tea.

1011
01:05:17,003 --> 01:05:21,463
Oh, you know, your home
reminds me of Maple Grove,

1012
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:24,977
- which is the seat
of my brother, Mr. Suckling.
- Suckling.

1013
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:28,844
- The hall? And the size of the rooms?
- Yes.

1014
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:31,179
I'm really quite struck by it.

1015
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,185
- I almost fancy myself there.
- [ Chuckles ]

1016
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:36,346
[ Emma ]
I'm glad you can feel so at ease.

1017
01:05:36,422 --> 01:05:39,414
My brother and sister will
be enchanted with this place.

1018
01:05:39,492 --> 01:05:41,858
[ Chuckles ]

1019
01:05:41,928 --> 01:05:45,955
People who have extensive grounds are
always pleased to meet other people...

1020
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:48,626
with extensive grounds.

1021
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:52,899
I'm afraid you overrate Hartfield.
Surrey is full of beauties.

1022
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:56,874
Don't tell me about Surrey ! I always
say it is "the garden of England."

1023
01:05:56,943 --> 01:06:00,276
Yes, but many counties
are called that.

1024
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:03,474
Oh ? I fancy not.

1025
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:06,609
I never heard any county
but Surrey called so.

1026
01:06:06,686 --> 01:06:08,654
Mmm. Hmm.

1027
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:14,058
Oh ! Ah.

1028
01:06:14,127 --> 01:06:18,564
Well, I know little
of other places.

1029
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:23,034
We are...
a quiet set of people.

1030
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:25,468
- More disposed to stay at home.
- Yes.

1031
01:06:25,538 --> 01:06:30,373
Your father's health must be a great
drawback to your seeing the country.

1032
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:33,935
Why does he not try Bath ?
It would do him the world of good !

1033
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:36,709
He has... tried it before
without receiving any benefit.

1034
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:39,751
Oh, it will do him good
if only to improve his spirits,

1035
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:43,220
which, I understand,
are sometimes much depressed.

1036
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:45,917
You must take him !
A line from me and...

1037
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:48,893
you would have some of
the best society in the place.

1038
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:51,395
And my particular friend there,
Mrs. Partridge--

1039
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,729
Thank you, but our going to Bath
is out of the question.

1040
01:07:07,046 --> 01:07:11,039
Mrs. Elton, I have not
asked you if you are musical,

1041
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:13,950
and that is because
your reputation has preceded you.

1042
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,453
Oh, well--

1043
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,955
All the town knows
you are a superior performer.

1044
01:07:18,024 --> 01:07:20,720
- Well, I am dotingly fond of music.
- Yes, my wife--

1045
01:07:20,793 --> 01:07:24,024
And my friends say I'm not
entirely devoid of taste.

1046
01:07:24,096 --> 01:07:26,860
In fact, I told Mr. "E"
when he asked me to marry,

1047
01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:30,266
I said I did not have to have
two carriages as I did before,

1048
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:32,668
and I could even accept
a smaller house.

1049
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:35,400
My house before was
a good deal roomier, I assure you.

1050
01:07:35,474 --> 01:07:39,604
But, no, the world
is not necessary to me...

1051
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,275
because I am blessed
with so many resources... in here.

1052
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:49,014
"But," said l, "without music
my life would be a blank."

1053
01:07:49,088 --> 01:07:51,716
In fact, you and I
must establish a musical club !

1054
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:54,521
We could have regular meetings
at your house or ours.

1055
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:57,028
Because I don't want
to give up my talent.

1056
01:07:57,096 --> 01:07:59,462
- Do I ?
- Mrs. Elton,

1057
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:02,660
I am certain it would take something
more dramatic than a change of towns...

1058
01:08:02,735 --> 01:08:05,465
to dislodge a thing
as great as your talent.

1059
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:08,939
[ Laughing ] Oh, well,
I myself don't call it great.

1060
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:13,035
I only know that
my friends think so.

1061
01:08:19,919 --> 01:08:22,979
- [ Clears Throat ]
- [ Sighs ]

1062
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:34,763
Ooh ! Mmm.

1063
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:36,768
We met the Westons.

1064
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,999
Mmm, she is already
a favorite with me.

1065
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:42,973
And I was astonished
that she was so ladylike !

1066
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,101
Was she not your governess ?

1067
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:49,045
Mrs. Weston's modest propriety
makes her a model for any woman.

1068
01:08:49,115 --> 01:08:51,583
Do you know who came in
while we were there ?

1069
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:53,585
I cannot imagine.

1070
01:08:55,388 --> 01:08:57,982
Knightley.

1071
01:08:58,057 --> 01:08:59,684
Knightley ?

1072
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,853
Knightley !
Mr. "E's" friend.

1073
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:06,193
Well, there's one friend
of whom he need not be ashamed.

1074
01:09:06,265 --> 01:09:08,256
Quite the gentleman.

1075
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:10,802
[ Thinking ]
Knightley ?

1076
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,771
- Never seen him before
and she called him Knightley !
- I saw her at church.

1077
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,639
- She seemed--
- Vulgar ? Base ? Conceited ? Crass ?

1078
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,237
- How do you do, Mrs. Starr ?
- Good morning, Miss Woodhouse.

1079
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:25,341
She actually seemed pleased to discover
that Mr. Knightley was a gentleman.

1080
01:09:25,418 --> 01:09:29,149
I doubt he'll return the compliment
and find her a lady.

1081
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:32,418
- Mr. Simons, good morning.
- Morning, Miss Woodhouse.

1082
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:37,323
She proposed that we form
a musical club.

1083
01:09:37,396 --> 01:09:39,830
Is it possible
that Mr. Elton met her...

1084
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,629
while doing charitable work
in a mental infirmary ?

1085
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:44,670
[ Sighs ]

1086
01:09:44,737 --> 01:09:47,797
There is only one thing to do
with a person as impossible as she.

1087
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:51,172
- What ?
- I must throw a party for her,

1088
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:55,703
otherwise everyone will feel at once
how much I dislike her.

1089
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,715
[ Sighs ]

1090
01:09:57,783 --> 01:09:59,717
We're so excited about the party.

1091
01:09:59,785 --> 01:10:03,881
Do you know whom I just adore ?

1092
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:07,448
- Who I want to wrap up
and put in my pocket ?
- Knightley ?

1093
01:10:07,526 --> 01:10:10,586
Jane Fairfax ! Oh ! Ah !

1094
01:10:10,663 --> 01:10:12,790
I rave about her.

1095
01:10:12,865 --> 01:10:15,299
Do you know what
I admire most about her ?

1096
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:19,236
She's timid.
I'm a great advocate for timidity.

1097
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:22,331
But I daresay you know
the lines of the poet:

1098
01:10:22,408 --> 01:10:27,209
"Full many a flower
is born to blush unseen."

1099
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,737
We must not allow them
to be verified by sweet Jane.

1100
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,876
There is no danger of that.
The Campbells take great care of her.

1101
01:10:33,953 --> 01:10:37,184
Whatever advantages she's got from the
Campbells have palpably come to an end.

1102
01:10:37,256 --> 01:10:40,885
But if you and I set the example,
many will follow.

1103
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,521
Oh, we live in a style which could not
make the addition of Jane Fairfax...

1104
01:10:44,597 --> 01:10:46,656
the least inconvenient.

1105
01:10:46,732 --> 01:10:48,700
I'm simply going to adopt her,

1106
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:51,965
and I think that you
should do it with me.

1107
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:54,232
[ Emma ]
For the first time in my life,

1108
01:10:54,306 --> 01:10:56,900
I felt sorry
for Jane Fairfax.

1109
01:10:56,976 --> 01:11:01,106
Whatever she may have done,
she does not deserve Mrs. Elton.

1110
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,115
Jane may be glad
of Mrs. Elton's attentions,

1111
01:11:04,183 --> 01:11:07,050
since they are available
from no one else.

1112
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:12,618
She seems to receive
ample attention from you.

1113
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:16,422
- Anyone may know my regard for her.
- Oh ?

1114
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:20,124
- Do you know how high it is ?
- [ Clears Throat ]

1115
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:28,103
Oh, so, you two
have been settling...

1116
01:11:28,174 --> 01:11:31,575
- that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?
- No !

1117
01:11:31,644 --> 01:11:35,307
You could not come and sit with us
if you were married.

1118
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,787
Jane Fairfax
is a very charming young woman.

1119
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:49,919
But she lacks an open temper,
which a man wishes for in a wife.

1120
01:11:56,402 --> 01:11:59,565
I have admiration for her,

1121
01:11:59,638 --> 01:12:02,664
but no thought beyond,
not at all.

1122
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:07,842
No.
[ Chuckles ]

1123
01:12:11,183 --> 01:12:14,277
Ah, I see Mr. Weston is at home.
I'll go and see him.

1124
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:22,951
Well, Mrs. Weston, what do you say
about your suspicions now ?

1125
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:30,798
He's so very occupied with his
not being in love with her,

1126
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:33,771
it seems certain that he is.

1127
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:41,979
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

1128
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:48,283
It was most kind of you
to invite Jane Fairfax this evening.

1129
01:12:48,354 --> 01:12:51,255
Your words the other day
shamed me.

1130
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:53,587
I have not tried as I should have.

1131
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:57,095
You're capable of great kindness.

1132
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:59,687
I fall short so often.

1133
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,067
And I highly doubt
she will find this a kindness.

1134
01:13:04,136 --> 01:13:07,572
Jane, you're a very,
very fragile creature.

1135
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,872
You pay no regard to the delicacy
of your constitution.

1136
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:14,538
Jane. Knightley !

1137
01:13:14,613 --> 01:13:17,548
Help us ! Knightley !

1138
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:20,346
Jane went to the post office
today in the rain...

1139
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:23,047
at great peril to her health !

1140
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:26,990
Oh, Jane, you sad girl !

1141
01:13:27,059 --> 01:13:29,687
This is a sign that I was
not there to take care of you.

1142
01:13:29,762 --> 01:13:31,627
Knightley !

1143
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:34,461
Tell her. Tell her !

1144
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:39,368
I'm sure she knows what
she can endure, Mrs. Elton.

1145
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,929
But, of course.

1146
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:43,941
Do take care of yourself.

1147
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:46,068
Thank you.

1148
01:13:52,818 --> 01:13:55,218
Mr. Weston.

1149
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:59,348
[ Woodhouse ] We had quite given you up.
I'm afraid we had to start without you.

1150
01:13:59,425 --> 01:14:03,088
Oh, forgive me, Mr. Woodhouse, Emma.
No, please.

1151
01:14:03,162 --> 01:14:07,997
The journey from London was especially
slow, or perhaps it just seemed so...

1152
01:14:08,067 --> 01:14:11,434
as I had some good news

with Mr. "E" to welcome him.

01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:09,737
I have found a position
for you.

1316
01:28:09,808 --> 01:28:11,867
It is with a choice family
in Bath,

1317
01:28:11,943 --> 01:28:14,343
- and the position is one of--
- [ Jane ] I'm most obliged,

1318
01:28:14,412 --> 01:28:18,109
but I would not consider
leaving Highbury.

1319
01:28:18,183 --> 01:28:21,311
As your protector, I cannot
allow you to feel that way.

1320
01:28:21,386 --> 01:28:23,946
I'm sure everyone
agrees with me.

1321
01:28:24,022 --> 01:28:27,514
What are your options
after all, Jane, hmm ?

1322
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:30,083
These sandwiches
are delicious, Mrs. Elton.

1323
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:33,597
- You really are a gourmet.
- [ Laughs ]

1324
01:28:33,665 --> 01:28:36,225
Well, I never compliment
myself, but...

1325
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:39,031
my friends tell me I certainly
know how to make a sandwich.

1326
01:28:40,572 --> 01:28:44,770
- Now, Jane--
- Shall we all play a game ?

1327
01:28:44,843 --> 01:28:48,609
I command that we each tell
Miss Woodhouse something entertaining.

1328
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,807
You may offer one thing
very clever,

1329
01:28:50,882 --> 01:28:53,783
two things moderately clever,

1330
01:28:53,852 --> 01:28:56,548
or three things very dull indeed.

1331
01:28:56,621 --> 01:29:00,079
In return, Miss Woodhouse
will laugh heartily at them all.

1332
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:02,626
[ Mrs. Elton ]
I do not pretend to be a wit,

1333
01:29:02,694 --> 01:29:06,221
though I have a great deal
of vivacity in my own way, of course.

1334
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:10,927
These diversions are tolerable at
Christmas when one is around the fire.

1335
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:14,665
But in my opinion,
it wastes the outdoors.

1336
01:29:14,739 --> 01:29:16,798
Miss Woodhouse,
you must excuse me.

1337
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,207
[ Elton ]
And me.

1338
01:29:19,277 --> 01:29:21,871
I am an old married man.

1339
01:29:21,946 --> 01:29:24,380
I have nothing to say that
would please Miss Woodhouse...

1340
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:27,475
or any young lady.

1341
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,713
Oh, [ Chuckles ]
well.

1342
01:29:29,787 --> 01:29:33,120
I need not be uneasy, as long
as we're allowed three dull things.

1343
01:29:33,191 --> 01:29:35,921
[ Laughing ] Very dull, in fact. I shall
be sure to say three very dull things...

1344
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:39,157
as soon as I open my mouth,
shan't I ?

1345
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:42,028
There may be a difficulty.

1346
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,762
[ Miss Bates ] I doubt that. I'm sure
I never fail to say things very dull.

1347
01:29:44,836 --> 01:29:47,600
Yes, dear, but you'll be limited
as to number. Only three.

1348
01:29:47,672 --> 01:29:50,903
Oh !
[ Giggles ]

1349
01:29:56,748 --> 01:29:58,841
To be sure.

1350
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:00,851
[ Miss Bates ]
Yes.

1351
01:30:03,621 --> 01:30:05,555
[ Miss Bates ]
l, l--

1352
01:30:05,623 --> 01:30:07,591
I, l--

1353
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:13,223
I, I see. I see.
I see what she means.

1354
01:30:13,298 --> 01:30:17,029
Hmm. I will try
and hold my tongue.

1355
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:22,403
Oh, I must make myself
very... disagreeable.

1356
01:30:22,473 --> 01:30:27,467
Or, or she would not have said
such a thing to an old... friend.

1357
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:34,041
Well, [ Giggles ]
just three.

1358
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:36,086
Yes.

1359
01:30:42,393 --> 01:30:45,954
Miss Bates, will you give me
the pleasure of your company...

1360
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:49,397
- whilst I pick some more strawberries ?
- Oh, thank you,

1361
01:30:49,467 --> 01:30:51,094
Mr. Knightley.

1362
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:53,831
That would be charming.

1363
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:05,949
Emma ?

1364
01:31:06,017 --> 01:31:09,111
How could you be so unfeeling
to Miss Bates ?

1365
01:31:10,755 --> 01:31:14,122
How could you be so insolent
to a woman of her age and situation ?

1366
01:31:14,192 --> 01:31:16,285
I'd not thought it possible.

1367
01:31:16,361 --> 01:31:20,127
How could I help saying it ?
I daresay she did not understand me.

1368
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:22,962
I assure you she felt
your full meaning.

1369
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:25,400
She cannot stop mentioning it.

1370
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,598
I wish you could have heard
her honor your forbearance
in putting up with her...

1371
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:30,607
when her society is so irksome !

1372
01:31:30,675 --> 01:31:33,200
I know there is no better creature
in all the world, but you must allow...

1373
01:31:33,277 --> 01:31:36,804
that blended alongside the good,
there is an equal amount
of the ridiculous in her.

1374
01:31:36,881 --> 01:31:39,782
Were she prosperous or a woman
equal to you in situation,

1375
01:31:39,851 --> 01:31:43,082
I would not quarrel
about any liberties of manner.

1376
01:31:43,154 --> 01:31:45,952
But she is poor !

1377
01:31:46,024 --> 01:31:48,322
Even more so
than when she was born !

1378
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:51,920
And should she live to be an old lady,
she will sink further still.

1379
01:31:51,996 --> 01:31:56,729
Her situation being in every way below
you should secure your compassion !

1380
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:59,099
Badly done, Emma.

1381
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:03,507
Badly done.

1382
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:10,406
She has watched you grow from a time
when her notice of you was an honor...

1383
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:14,713
to this.

1384
01:32:14,786 --> 01:32:17,755
Humbling her
and laughing at her...

1385
01:32:17,822 --> 01:32:21,349
in front of people who would be guided
by your treatment of her.

1386
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:30,367
Ah !

1387
01:32:33,705 --> 01:32:37,368
It is not pleasant
for me to say these things.

1388
01:32:39,377 --> 01:32:43,404
But I must tell you the truth
while I can.

1389
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,610
Proving myself your friend
by the most faithful counsel,

1390
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:55,822
and trusting that sometime you will
do my faith in you greater justice...

1391
01:32:55,893 --> 01:32:58,589
than you do it now.

1392
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:19,141
Oh, good afternoon,
Miss Woodhouse.

1393
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:21,344
Please come in.

1394
01:33:27,558 --> 01:33:30,220
Just a moment, please.

1395
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:33,661
Just tell her I'm unwell, Mother,
and laid down upon the bed.

1396
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,916
[ Knightley ]
I've been planning a visit--

1397
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,591
- ...first and say good-bye.
- [ Woodhouse ] You mean, you walked...

1398
01:34:07,665 --> 01:34:10,998
- all the way, and on such a cold night?
- Certainly I walked.

1399
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:15,562
My dear, how did you find
my old friend and her daughter ?

1400
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,666
Emma has called on
Mrs. and Miss Bates.

1401
01:34:18,743 --> 01:34:22,975
- She always shows them such kindness.
- No, Father.

1402
01:34:23,047 --> 01:34:26,073
They have been the ones
to forebear and show me kindness.

1403
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:30,416
Nonsense, daughter !
The charity you have given them--

1404
01:34:30,488 --> 01:34:34,219
I have given them charity
but not kindness,

1405
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:38,592
a virtue which some friends
may doubt I still have.

1406
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:43,658
The truest friend
does not doubt...

1407
01:34:43,734 --> 01:34:46,202
but hope.

1408
01:34:58,382 --> 01:35:00,316
I must go.

1409
01:35:00,384 --> 01:35:04,718
I'm leaving town
to visit John and lsabella.

1410
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:07,781
I'm sorry
I was not here sooner...

1411
01:35:07,859 --> 01:35:10,885
so that we could have talked.

1412
01:35:12,196 --> 01:35:14,130
So am l.

1413
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,630
When will you be back ?

1414
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:21,194
I don't know.

1415
01:35:21,272 --> 01:35:24,537
There is a delicate
and perplexing matter...

1416
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:27,237
I must discuss
with my brother.

1417
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:32,549
Well, then--

1418
01:35:33,851 --> 01:35:35,785
Well, then--

1419
01:35:35,853 --> 01:35:37,878
[ Chuckles ]

1420
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:47,754
[ Thinking ] Frank Churchill's aunt
has died, taking him away.

1421
01:35:47,832 --> 01:35:52,394
This strengthens Harriet's chances with
him, since the aunt was sure to object.

1422
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:56,099
I continue in my efforts
to make amends with Miss Bates.

1423
01:35:56,173 --> 01:35:58,539
Though matters are not yet
fully repaired,

1424
01:35:58,609 --> 01:36:02,136
I feel that a renewal
of our friendship is ahead of us.

1425
01:36:02,213 --> 01:36:04,977
Above all,
I am most gratified to say...

1426
01:36:05,049 --> 01:36:07,313
that could Mr. Knightley--

1427
01:36:11,689 --> 01:36:14,817
Mr. Knightley--

1428
01:36:14,892 --> 01:36:16,519
Hmm.

1429
01:36:16,594 --> 01:36:20,291
Had been privy to my attempts,
could he have seen into my heart,

1430
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:25,233
I think he would not, on this occasion,
have found anything to reprove.

1431
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:29,537
[ Panting ]

1432
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:34,336
Frank... is engaged.

1433
01:36:34,412 --> 01:36:38,439
[ Gasps ] I cannot believe it !
So quickly ?

1434
01:36:38,516 --> 01:36:41,883
Quickly ? The engagement
has been in place for some time.

1435
01:36:43,487 --> 01:36:46,752
Emma, Frank has been
secretly engaged...

1436
01:36:46,824 --> 01:36:48,951
to Jane Fairfax.

1437
01:36:49,026 --> 01:36:51,290
Good God !

1438
01:36:51,362 --> 01:36:54,422
- This cannot be the truth !
- They've been engaged since October,

1439
01:36:54,498 --> 01:36:57,934
formed at Weymouth
through their friend, Charles Dixon.

1440
01:36:58,002 --> 01:37:00,061
Mr. Dixon !

1441
01:37:00,137 --> 01:37:03,504
He kept it secret because
he feared his aunt's disapproval.

1442
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:07,803
It has hurt
both his father and me,

1443
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:11,541
most especially because
of whom else it might hurt.

1444
01:37:13,718 --> 01:37:18,519
I cannot pretend that I do not
understand what you mean by that.

1445
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:21,353
But let me give you
all the relief in my power.

1446
01:37:21,425 --> 01:37:25,088
There was a time
when I was attached to Frank.

1447
01:37:25,162 --> 01:37:30,327
Fortunately, that ceased and for
some time I have felt nothing for him.

1448
01:37:30,401 --> 01:37:34,667
This was my greatest worry.

1449
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:38,300
I'm certain you knew it was
our wish you might be attached.

1450
01:37:38,376 --> 01:37:43,473
- Imagine what we felt on your account.
- There is no need to worry about that.

1451
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:46,778
Although how could he have come here
and treated me in this fashion ?

1452
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,842
It is cruel !
Truly cruel !

1453
01:37:48,919 --> 01:37:52,719
Yes, dear. But I thought you said
you felt nothing for him.

1454
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:54,724
Yes, but he did not know that.

1455
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:57,852
He is benefiting from
a very lucky coincidence.

1456
01:37:57,928 --> 01:38:00,362
Now, Emma, he's a good man,

1457
01:38:00,431 --> 01:38:03,832
however wrong
this action might be.

1458
01:38:07,438 --> 01:38:11,499
Dear, might I entreat you
to put Mr. Weston's heart at ease ?

1459
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:13,770
He's been as worried
about you as l.

1460
01:38:13,844 --> 01:38:16,574
Could you let him know
how glad you are for Frank...

1461
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:19,445
to have found a girl
of such steady character ?

1462
01:38:19,517 --> 01:38:22,486
I do not know how steady her character
can be, engaging herself to a man...

1463
01:38:22,553 --> 01:38:24,487
who pretends not to be engaged,

1464
01:38:24,555 --> 01:38:26,489
and then deceives attractive
and feeling young women.

1465
01:38:26,557 --> 01:38:28,422
[ Door Opens ]

1466
01:38:28,492 --> 01:38:32,656
Here is the luckiest father
in all of England !

1467
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:37,763
Thank you.

1468
01:38:39,537 --> 01:38:43,064
- [ Door Opens ]
- Is this not the oddest news
you've ever heard about...

1469
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,267
Mr. Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?

1470
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:47,776
- Had you any idea of it ?
- Can you imagine that I knew...

1471
01:38:47,845 --> 01:38:50,245
when I was encouraging you
to give way to your own feelings ?

1472
01:38:50,314 --> 01:38:52,544
Had I known,
I would have cautioned you.

1473
01:38:52,616 --> 01:38:54,550
Cautioned me ? Why ?

1474
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:58,247
You do not think that I care
about Frank Churchill !

1475
01:38:58,322 --> 01:39:01,382
Wha-- What do you mean ?

1476
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:04,895
- You, you said that you loved a man--
- I did not name him,

1477
01:39:04,962 --> 01:39:09,592
but I hope I have developed better taste
than to choose Frank Churchill over him.

Frank Churchill.

01:39:12,303 --> 01:39:14,498
Furthermore, I would never
have even dreamed of him...

1480
01:39:14,572 --> 01:39:16,506
except that you told me
he was wonderful.

1481
01:39:16,574 --> 01:39:18,565
Yes, but I thought
you meant--

1482
01:39:18,642 --> 01:39:21,202
That raising my thoughts to him
was a sign of my good taste.

1483
01:39:21,278 --> 01:39:24,042
- Those were your words.
- But I meant them in reference to--

1484
01:39:24,115 --> 01:39:26,640
Without having heard them,
I would never have dared to hope.

1485
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:28,582
Harriet, please !

1486
01:39:28,652 --> 01:39:33,112
Before we can go on,
there is something that I must clarify.

1487
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:38,193
Is it possible
that you are speaking of...

1488
01:39:38,262 --> 01:39:40,196
Mr. Knightley ?

1489
01:39:40,264 --> 01:39:42,755
To be sure.

1490
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:46,599
But, y-you spoke of the service
that Frank had done you...

1491
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,571
- in rescuing you from the gypsies.
- I never said that.

1492
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,040
I recall it
with perfect clarity.

1493
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:55,340
If I spoke of being rescued,
I was thinking of Mr. Knightley's...

1494
01:39:55,412 --> 01:39:58,245
asking me to dance
after Mr. Elton snubbed me.

1495
01:39:58,315 --> 01:40:01,284
That was when I knew
how superior a man he was.

1496
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:04,947
Good God !
This is a horrible mistake.

1497
01:40:05,022 --> 01:40:07,991
What is to be done ?

1498
01:40:08,058 --> 01:40:10,686
Must something be done about it ?

1499
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:20,464
You must think him 500 million times
more above me than Mr. Churchill.

1500
01:40:20,538 --> 01:40:22,472
- Yet, you did say--
- Harriet ?

1501
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:26,639
Have--

1502
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:30,840
Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's
returning your affection ?

1503
01:40:30,915 --> 01:40:36,012
Yes, I must say that I have.
You told me...

1504
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:39,021
to let his behavior be the rule
of mine, and so I have.

1505
01:40:39,089 --> 01:40:41,887
Am I wrong to hope as I do ?

1506
01:40:46,697 --> 01:40:49,222
Harriet,

1507
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,669
I can only venture to declare
that Mr. Knightley...

1508
01:40:53,737 --> 01:40:58,697
is the last man on earth who would
intentionally give any woman...

1509
01:40:58,776 --> 01:41:02,735
the idea of his feeling more
for her than he really does.

1510
01:41:06,217 --> 01:41:08,208
[ Emma ]
This is tragic.

1511
01:41:08,285 --> 01:41:10,617
[ Mrs. Weston ] Why is it tragic
that Harriet should attach herself...

1512
01:41:10,688 --> 01:41:13,748
to a man who you admire so much ?

1513
01:41:13,824 --> 01:41:16,884
I have asked myself many times
why this should have unsettled me,

1514
01:41:16,961 --> 01:41:21,728
and I came to see that I do not admire
Mr. Knightley as I have so long thought.

1515
01:41:24,969 --> 01:41:27,529
I love him...

1516
01:41:27,605 --> 01:41:30,631
so dearly, so greatly.

1517
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:33,802
Outside of you and Father,
his is the opinion which matters most.

1518
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,845
- Oh, my dearest child !
- I did not know it...

1519
01:41:35,913 --> 01:41:38,939
until poor Harriet said she had
the hope of him returning her feelings.

1520
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:41,917
Then I felt ill
that I could lose him,

1521
01:41:41,986 --> 01:41:46,389
and I knew that no one
must marry Mr. Knightley...

1522
01:41:46,457 --> 01:41:50,518
- but me.
- How heavenly !

1523
01:41:50,594 --> 01:41:52,892
But I am too late.

1524
01:41:52,963 --> 01:41:55,056
Just before he left town
he said--

1525
01:41:55,132 --> 01:41:59,000
There is a delicate and perplexing
matter I must discuss with my brother.

1526
01:41:59,069 --> 01:42:01,333
I hope his brother
advises him to be careful.

1527
01:42:01,405 --> 01:42:04,272
After all, we know nothing about
her parents. They could be pirates.

1528
01:42:04,341 --> 01:42:08,801
My dear, I like Harriet very much,
as I might remind you, do you.

1529
01:42:08,879 --> 01:42:12,440
But remember, her feelings
are evidence of her feelings only.

1530
01:42:12,516 --> 01:42:15,246
Nothing can be known
until Mr. Knightley returns.

1531
01:42:15,319 --> 01:42:20,120
Oh, I long for it
and fear it at the same time.

1532
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:23,284
I shall not know how to behave
when I see him.

1533
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,057
- Let his behavior be your guide.
- But, oh, dear !

1534
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:30,157
If he seems happy, I shall know
that he has decided to marry Harriet,

1535
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:35,604
and I will not, I know I will not
be able to let him tell me.

1536
01:42:35,673 --> 01:42:38,938
I could not bear
to hear the words.

1537
01:42:39,009 --> 01:42:42,740
If he seems sad, I shall know that John
has advised him not to marry Harriet.

1538
01:42:42,813 --> 01:42:45,179
I love John !

1539
01:42:45,249 --> 01:42:50,016
Or, he may seem sad because he fears
telling me he will marry my friend.

1540
01:42:50,087 --> 01:42:52,988
How could John let him do that ?
I hate John !

1541
01:42:53,057 --> 01:42:55,491
My dear, nothing can be done
until he returns.

1542
01:42:55,559 --> 01:42:58,926
And until he does, you must try
to put him out of your mind.

1543
01:42:58,996 --> 01:43:00,691
Can you ?

1544
01:43:00,764 --> 01:43:02,891
Certainly I can.

1545
01:43:02,966 --> 01:43:07,266
I may have lost my heart,
but not my self-control.

1546
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,365
[ Thinking ]
Dear diary.

1547
01:43:11,442 --> 01:43:15,640
Today I tried not
to think about Mr. Knightley.

1548
01:43:15,713 --> 01:43:19,843
I tried not to think about him
when I spoke about the menu with cook.

1549
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:23,250
- Oh, is Mr. Knightley coming ?
- Why do you say that ?

1550
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,413
Lamb stew's his favorite.

1551
01:43:25,489 --> 01:43:27,980
I tried not to think about him
in the garden...

1552
01:43:28,058 --> 01:43:30,492
where I thrice plucked
the petals off a daisy...

1553
01:43:30,561 --> 01:43:33,860
to ascertain his feelings
for Harriet.

1554
01:43:33,931 --> 01:43:36,559
I don't think we should
keep daisies in the garden.

1555
01:43:36,633 --> 01:43:40,160
They really are
drab little flowers.

1556
01:43:40,237 --> 01:43:44,139
And I tried not to think
about him when I went to bed.

1557
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:46,768
But something had to be done.

1558
01:44:10,267 --> 01:44:14,727
Dear Lord, if he cannot share
a life with me,

1559
01:44:14,805 --> 01:44:18,366
is it wrong to ask
that he not share it with anyone ?

1560
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:21,172
That we go on
as we go on now,

1561
01:44:21,245 --> 01:44:23,805
him stopping by at any hour,

1562
01:44:23,881 --> 01:44:27,044
always the brightest part
of our lives,

1563
01:44:27,117 --> 01:44:31,554
a natural and easy member
of the family ?

1564
01:44:31,622 --> 01:44:34,853
I would be content if he
would just stay single, Lord.

1565
01:44:34,925 --> 01:44:38,258
That's it. If he would
just stay single, Lord,

1566
01:44:38,328 --> 01:44:41,559
that would be enough for me
to be perfectly satisfied.

1567
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:46,225
Almost.

1568
01:44:46,303 --> 01:44:48,237
Amen.

- [ Clears Throat ]
- Forgive me.

1572
01:45:18,502 --> 01:45:23,405
Uh, I was, uh--
I was lost in my thoughts.

1573
01:45:23,474 --> 01:45:26,136
And how are you ?

1574
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:28,701
Happy ?

1575
01:45:28,779 --> 01:45:31,646
W-Well, I'm...

1576
01:45:31,715 --> 01:45:34,275
- happy to see you, as always.
- Ah.

1577
01:45:36,019 --> 01:45:38,920
- I didn't, uh, know that you were back.
- Just.

1578
01:45:38,989 --> 01:45:41,549
Oh.

1579
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:44,185
- Yes, just.
- Oh. Yes.

1580
01:45:47,097 --> 01:45:49,622
I'm on my way home.

1581
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,691
I was just there.

1582
01:45:53,770 --> 01:45:56,238
- May I join you ?
- Of course.

[ Sighs ]
Oh, dear.

1584
01:46:06,316 --> 01:46:09,410
- What ?
- What ? Oh. Oh !

1585
01:46:09,486 --> 01:46:14,651
Something about the deer we need
for the venison stew.

1586
01:46:14,725 --> 01:46:17,660
Uh-huh.

1587
01:46:20,197 --> 01:46:23,564
- There's something I have to ask you.
- Oh, wait.

1588
01:46:23,634 --> 01:46:27,263
Now that you are back, there is
some news that will surprise you.

1589
01:46:29,273 --> 01:46:31,764
Of what nature is this news ?

1590
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:34,640
The very best.
It is a wedding between two people--

1591
01:46:34,711 --> 01:46:38,511
Oh, yes, between Jane
and Mr. Churchill.

1592
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:43,916
Mr. Weston wrote to me.

1593
01:46:43,987 --> 01:46:48,356
- Undoubtedly you were not surprised.
- Well--

1594
01:46:48,425 --> 01:46:51,861
But I seem doomed
to blindness.

1595
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:56,099
Time will heal your wound.

1596
01:46:58,468 --> 01:47:02,404
- My wound ?
- I know you must've been...

1597
01:47:02,472 --> 01:47:05,032
cruelly disappointed
by his secret.

1598
01:47:05,108 --> 01:47:09,135
[ Sighs ]
He's a scoundrel.

1599
01:47:10,247 --> 01:47:12,477
You are kind.

1600
01:47:12,549 --> 01:47:15,382
But I must tell you that I quickly saw
that Frank lacked qualities,

1601
01:47:15,452 --> 01:47:20,014
honesty being one of them, which are
essential to me in any kind of friend.

1602
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:26,818
Emma, uh-- Is that true ?

1603
01:47:28,966 --> 01:47:32,026
He imposed on me,
but he has not injured me.

1604
01:47:32,102 --> 01:47:34,036
Yes.

1605
01:47:34,104 --> 01:47:37,369
He got everything he wanted
at great expense to others...

1606
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:40,410
and at no cost to himself.

1607
01:47:41,945 --> 01:47:44,140
He offends me deeply.

1608
01:47:45,749 --> 01:47:50,243
Yet, there is, there's something
in his situation that I envy.

1609
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,586
Did I mention that we are
having a new drain installed ?

1610
01:47:54,658 --> 01:47:57,684
You will not ask me
the point of my envy ?

1611
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:06,294
Well, perhaps you are wise.

1612
01:48:06,370 --> 01:48:09,396
But l--

1613
01:48:09,473 --> 01:48:15,173
I cannot be wise. Emma,
I must tell you what you will not ask,

1614
01:48:15,245 --> 01:48:18,180
- though I may wish it unsaid
the next moment.
- Then do not speak it.

1615
01:48:18,248 --> 01:48:23,049
Do not commit yourself to something
which may injure us both to have said.

1616
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,830
Very well.

1617
01:48:38,669 --> 01:48:42,605
Very well... good day.

1618
01:49:09,833 --> 01:49:11,926
Mr. Knightley ?

1619
01:49:15,472 --> 01:49:17,770
Mr. Knightley,

1620
01:49:17,841 --> 01:49:21,572
I stopped you ungraciously
just now and gave you pain.

1621
01:49:21,645 --> 01:49:25,376
If you have any wish to speak
to me openly about anything
you might have in contemplation,

1622
01:49:25,449 --> 01:49:29,180
as your friend
I cannot refuse you.

1623
01:49:29,252 --> 01:49:32,312
Indeed,
as your old friend,

1624
01:49:32,389 --> 01:49:35,620
I will hear whatever it is
you wish to tell me.

1625
01:49:35,692 --> 01:49:37,125
Emma !

1626
01:49:37,194 --> 01:49:41,130
You want our friendship to remain
the same as it has always been.

1627
01:49:42,566 --> 01:49:46,764
- But I cannot desire that.
- But why ?

1628
01:49:46,837 --> 01:49:49,670
I know I made mistakes, but had you
been here the last few days...

1629
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:52,004
you would have seen
how I have tried to change.

1630
01:49:52,075 --> 01:49:54,873
Please, tell me
I am your friend.

1631
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:58,346
I do not wish to call you
my friend because...

1632
01:49:58,415 --> 01:50:02,181
I hope to call you something
infinitely more dear.

1633
01:50:05,589 --> 01:50:09,150
Have you not wondered why I never
befriended Frank Churchill ?

1634
01:50:11,795 --> 01:50:16,129
It was because I knew
he was intended for you.

1635
01:50:18,168 --> 01:50:23,572
Indeed, when you insulted
Miss Bates at the picnic,

1636
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,508
I thought that evidence
of his influence over you.

1637
01:50:28,945 --> 01:50:32,108
And I could not bear
to see it.

1638
01:50:32,182 --> 01:50:35,777
So I went away.

1639
01:50:35,852 --> 01:50:38,787
But I went to the wrong place.

1640
01:50:41,992 --> 01:50:45,553
My brother's house is usually
a place of comfort to me,

1641
01:50:45,629 --> 01:50:50,794
but seeing your sister there
kept you fresh in my mind.

1642
01:50:52,235 --> 01:50:54,965
And the torture,
I assure you,

1643
01:50:55,038 --> 01:50:57,268
was acute.

1644
01:50:57,340 --> 01:50:59,570
I only felt hope again...

1645
01:50:59,643 --> 01:51:04,103
when I heard of
Mr. Churchill's engagement.

1646
01:51:06,116 --> 01:51:08,311
And I rushed back,

1647
01:51:09,452 --> 01:51:12,910
anxious for your feelings.

1648
01:51:12,989 --> 01:51:15,116
Came to be near you.

1649
01:51:17,894 --> 01:51:19,919
I rode through the rain.

1650
01:51:24,701 --> 01:51:28,432
I-- I'd ride through
worse than that...

1651
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:31,736
if I could just hear your voice
telling me...

1652
01:51:31,808 --> 01:51:34,743
that I might at least have...

1653
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:37,405
some chance to win you.

1654
01:51:40,150 --> 01:51:43,313
Mr. Knightley,
if I have not spoken...

1655
01:51:43,386 --> 01:51:47,823
it is because I am afraid
I will awaken myself from this dream.

1656
01:51:47,891 --> 01:51:50,155
It cannot be true.

1657
01:51:53,263 --> 01:51:57,927
But I feel so full of error,
so mistaken in my makeup to deserve you.

1658
01:51:58,001 --> 01:52:00,162
What of my flaws ?

1659
01:52:00,237 --> 01:52:02,569
I've humbled you
and I've lectured you,

1660
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:05,938
and you have borne it
as no one could have borne it.

1661
01:52:11,581 --> 01:52:15,210
Maybe it is our imperfections which
make us so perfect for one another.

1662
01:52:25,228 --> 01:52:27,196
Marry me ?

1663
01:52:32,936 --> 01:52:38,374
Marry me,
my wonderful, darling friend.

1664
01:53:05,902 --> 01:53:08,336
Let's go to your father.

1665
01:53:08,405 --> 01:53:11,272
- Oh, dear.
- What ?

1666
01:53:11,341 --> 01:53:14,208
- I cannot marry you.
- Why ever not ?

1667
01:53:14,277 --> 01:53:16,802
My father.
First my sister, then Mrs. Weston.

1668
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,145
I don't think he could bear
my leaving, even for a man
he regards as highly as you.

1669
01:53:20,216 --> 01:53:25,119
I cannot marry you.
I cannot abandon him. I cannot !

1670
01:53:25,188 --> 01:53:29,818
I could not secure your happiness
while attacking your father's.

1671
01:53:29,893 --> 01:53:35,331
As long as his joy requires
your being at Hartfield,

1672
01:53:35,398 --> 01:53:38,060
Iet it be my home too.

1673
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:43,095
Thank you.

1674
01:53:43,173 --> 01:53:45,198
Thank you.

1675
01:53:47,243 --> 01:53:50,110
Now I need not call you
Mr. Knightley.

1676
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,741
I may call you my Mr. Knightley.

1677
01:54:28,151 --> 01:54:31,450
[ Mrs. Weston ] The elation Mr.
Woodhouse felt was soon shared by many.

1678
01:54:38,061 --> 01:54:40,894
While these exchanges
lifted the hearts of the couple,

1679
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:44,491
there was one visit
which did not.

1680
01:54:56,613 --> 01:54:58,911
Emma knew that the best chance
for Harriet's happiness...

1681
01:54:58,982 --> 01:55:01,314
was that she might marry as well.

1682
01:55:01,384 --> 01:55:05,912
But it seemed too much to hope
that even Harriet Smith...

1683
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:09,356
could be in love with more
than three men in one year.

1684
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:17,225
Miss Woodhouse,
may I come in ?

1685
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,825
You know you need never ask.

1686
01:55:19,903 --> 01:55:23,532
Please do,
and tell me how you've been.

1687
01:55:23,606 --> 01:55:25,972
It seems weeks
since you've been here.

1688
01:55:26,042 --> 01:55:30,342
Yes. I stayed away at first because
I thought it would be easier for me.

1689
01:55:31,748 --> 01:55:33,978
Then I stayed away because
I have something to tell you...

1690
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:35,984
which I'm afraid you will not like.

1691
01:55:36,052 --> 01:55:40,011
Harriet, nothing you could say
would ever be unpleasant.

1692
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:43,651
This is. That is,
I'm afraid you'll think it is,

1693
01:55:43,726 --> 01:55:47,526
though I think it
as beautiful as a dream.

1694
01:55:49,466 --> 01:55:53,402
I have consented
to marry Robert Martin.

1695
01:55:54,904 --> 01:55:58,431
- Whatever happened ?
- After I left here the last time,

1696
01:55:58,508 --> 01:56:00,601
I saw his sister at a party.

1697
01:56:00,677 --> 01:56:03,612
I fell easily
into conversation with her,

1698
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,944
and soon enough
she invited me to dinner.

1699
01:56:06,015 --> 01:56:08,415
Mr. Martin was there,
of course,

1700
01:56:08,485 --> 01:56:12,080
and we talked as though
we had never been apart.

1701
01:56:12,155 --> 01:56:16,285
As I left, he asked if he
could see me the next day.

1702
01:56:16,359 --> 01:56:20,455
I said that he could,
and on the next day...

1703
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:24,057
he asked if he could see me
the day after that.

1704
01:56:24,134 --> 01:56:26,364
And on the day after that,

1705
01:56:26,436 --> 01:56:29,803
he asked if he could see me
all the days ever after.

1706
01:56:29,873 --> 01:56:32,706
- Harriet.
- I know this disappoints you, but--

1707
01:56:32,775 --> 01:56:34,936
Harriet, you mistake me.

1708
01:56:35,011 --> 01:56:39,243
This is the perfect end
for my sad career as a matchmaker,

1709
01:56:39,315 --> 01:56:44,844
a role I gladly relinquish by being
instead so happily matched myself.

1710
01:56:46,322 --> 01:56:50,850
I hope you know that I
only wanted your happiness.

1711
01:56:50,927 --> 01:56:55,421
Now that you have found it,
it makes my own complete.

1712
01:57:00,937 --> 01:57:05,306
[ Cheers, Applause ]

1713
01:57:11,714 --> 01:57:16,276
[ Narrator ] There were those
who thought the wedding a little shabby.

1714
01:57:16,352 --> 01:57:19,617
I do not profess to be an expert
in the field of fashion,

1715
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:22,180
though my friends say
I have quite the eye.

1716
01:57:22,258 --> 01:57:26,058
But I can tell you,
there is a shocking lack of satin.

1717
01:57:42,712 --> 01:57:45,909
Bravo ! Bravo !

1718
01:57:56,326 --> 01:57:59,056
[ Narrator ] However, the wishes,
the faith and the predictions...

1719
01:57:59,128 --> 01:58:02,791
of the small band of true friends
who witnessed the ceremony...

1720
01:58:02,865 --> 01:58:07,564
were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union.
