1
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,355
Grandpa!

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,274
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

3
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,796
I just wanted to know.

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,275
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

5
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,793
You should know the story.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,555
OK, here we go.

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,438
It was 1832.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,557
On a night much like this.

9
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,230
Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,549
He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.

11
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,953
And he knew he was dying.

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,069
He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,631
and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson,

14
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,757
because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,199
Did he talk to him?

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,358
No. He never got the chance.

17
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,715
The president wasn't there that night.

18
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,152
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

19
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,313
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,233
my grandfather's grandfather,

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,712
Thomas Gates.

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,916
What was the secret?

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,595
A treasure.

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,632
A treasure beyond all imagining.

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,557
A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries

26
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,872
by tyrants, pharaohs,
emperors, warlords.

27
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,516
And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,828
And then suddenly...

29
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,151
it vanished.

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,912
It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years,

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,752
when knights from the First Crusade

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,150
discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,629
You see, the knights who found the vaults

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,918
believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,911
not even a king.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,075
They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar".

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,398
Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe

38
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,278
and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons,

39
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,033
in honour of
the builders of the great temple.

40
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,759
War followed.

41
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,628
By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,790
By then the Masons included

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,839
George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,552
They knew they had to make sure

45
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,916
the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,959
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,713
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,870
until only one remained -

49
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,717
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

50
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,549
Charlotte.

51
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,670
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,078
Who's Charlotte?

53
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,675
Oh, not even Mr Carroll knew that.

54
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,478
Now look here, Ben.

55
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,792
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,313
Like these.

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,551
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,113
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

59
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,755
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

60
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,513
You know what that dollar represents?

61
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,068
The entire Gates family fortune.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,358
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,716
It's not about the money, Patrick.
It's never been about the money.

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,870
Come on, son. Time to go.

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,153
You can... say your goodbyes.

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,878
Grandpa?

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,558
Are we knights?

68
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,789
Do you want to be?

69
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,156
All right. Um... kneel.

70
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,157
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,633
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

72
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,518
and the family Gates.

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,196
Do you so swear?

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,191
I so swear.

75
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,110
I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,591
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

78
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,917
We getting closer?

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,834
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,514
we should be getting very close.

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,070
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

82
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,715
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

83
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,837
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

84
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,789
OK.

85
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,350
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

86
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,476
No, no. Absolutely not.

87
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,559
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

88
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,519
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

89
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,670
Look... this is a waste of time.

90
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,638
How could a ship wind up way out here?

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,757
Well, I'm no expert, but...

92
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,798
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

93
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,348
produce hurricane-force ice storms

94
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,353
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

95
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,877
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,509
that would land a ship right around here.

97
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,232
Hello, beautiful.

98
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,396
Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

99
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,516
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,830
<i>I don't know
if I ever would have found Charlotte.</i>

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,559
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

102
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,838
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,239
I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.

104
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,598
Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.

105
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,918
OK!

106
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,956
Let's go!

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,554
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

108
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,916
Oh, God!

109
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,472
You handled that well.

110
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,829
This is it.

111
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,071
It's the cargo hold.

112
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,559
Do you think it's in the barrels?

113
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,153
Gunpowder.

114
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,793
OK...

115
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,316
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

116
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,311
I found something!

117
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,551
What is it?

118
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,436
Do you guys know what this is?

119
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,115
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

120
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,116
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

121
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,476
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

122
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,553
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

123
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,279
Let me see that.

124
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,356
No, don't break it!

125
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,954
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

126
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,508
<i>Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.</i>

127
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,034
<i>No, "The secret lies with Charlotte."</i>

128
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,111
I said it could be here.

129
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,840
It's Templar symbols.

130
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,996
"The legend writ."

131
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,116
"The stain effected."

132
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,112
"The key in Silence undetected."

133
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,558
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

134
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,875
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

135
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,430
It's a riddle.

136
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,118
I need to think.

137
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,431
"The legend writ."

138
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,397
"The stain effected."

139
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,191
What legend?

140
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,278
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

141
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,351
How?

142
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,749
"The key in Silence undetected."

143
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,631
Wait.

144
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,359
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

145
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,839
A map.

146
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,593
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

147
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,750
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

148
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,355
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

149
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,558
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

150
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,074
used to bring about a certain result.

151
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,879
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected",

152
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,795
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

153
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,519
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

154
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,989
Prison.

155
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,438
Albuquerque.

156
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,988
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

157
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,719
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

158
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,199
"Iron pen" is a prison.

159
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,479
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

160
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,358
the "pen" is... just a pen.

161
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,672
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

162
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,436
Cos it's a prison.

163
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,479
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

164
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,039
it describes what was penned.

165
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,237
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

166
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,912
No, no, no, that's stupid.

167
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,199
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

168
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,831
It was resolved.

169
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,477
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

170
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,075
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

171
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,278
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

172
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,989
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

173
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,834
a resolution that 55 men signed.

174
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,199
The Declaration of Independence.

175
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,832
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

176
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,275
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

177
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,510
would ensure the map's survival.

178
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,239
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

179
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,471
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

180
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,150
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

181
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,277
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

182
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,558
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

183
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,074
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

184
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,876
We could borrow it.

185
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,711
Steal it?

186
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,833
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

187
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,230
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

188
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,914
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

189
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,918
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

190
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,231
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

191
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,436
only to have
the respected historical community

192
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,195
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

193
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,669
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

194
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,320
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

195
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,793
How?

196
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,833
We all have our areas of expertise.

197
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,270
You don't think mine are limited
to writing cheques, do you?

198
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,476
In another life...

199
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,792
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

200
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,555
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

201
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,479
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

202
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,155
No.

203
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,194
I'd really need your help here.

204
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,593
Ian... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

205
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,796
OK.

206
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,077
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

207
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,510
Hey!

208
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,388
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

209
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,639
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

210
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,837
Information you don't have. I do.

211
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,832
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

212
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,150
He's bluffing.

213
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,800
We played poker together, Ian.
You know I can't bluff.

214
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,110
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,395
or I'll shoot your friend.

216
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,833
Hey!

217
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,150
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

218
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,679
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

219
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,435
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

220
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,074
Ben...

221
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,312
What happens when the flare burns down?

222
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,354
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

223
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,838
You need to know...

224
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,797
if Shaw can catch.

225
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,032
Nice try, though.

226
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,831
Get out, Shaw!

227
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,712
Fool!

228
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,638
Riley, get over here!

229
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,314
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

230
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,993
Move! Get out of here!

231
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,638
- What?
- Move! Get out!

232
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,711
Follow me.

233
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,952
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

234
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,836
Get down.

235
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,910
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

236
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,272
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

237
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,239
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

238
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,430
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

239
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,672
No, I meant about Ian. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

240
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,438
We stop him.

241
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,068
Is it really so hard to believe

242
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,515
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

243
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,955
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

244
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,315
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

245
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,834
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

246
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,912
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

247
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,596
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

248
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,272
Obsessed.

249
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,952
Passionate.

250
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,670
Excuse me.

251
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,588
- Dr Chase can see you now, Mr Brown.
- Thank you.

252
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,908
Mr Brown?

253
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,197
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

254
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,271
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

255
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,431
A very cute man.

256
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,715
Thank you.

257
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,916
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

258
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,516
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

259
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,875
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

260
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,356
Nice to meet you, Bill.

261
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,557
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

262
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,676
Saxony German.

263
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,239
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

264
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,232
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

265
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,756
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

266
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,354
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

267
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,318
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

268
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,233
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

269
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,356
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,079
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

271
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,831
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

272
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,316
It's true.

273
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,876
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

274
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,757
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

275
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,071
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

276
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,628
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

277
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,508
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

278
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,068
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

279
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,116
What do you think you're gonna find?

280
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,435
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

281
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,673
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

282
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,671
Of what?

283
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,638
A... cartograph.

284
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,870
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

285
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,999
A map of what?

286
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,991
The location of...

287
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:13,228
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

288
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,116
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

289
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,998
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

290
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,310
We're more like treasure-protectors.

291
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,277
Mr Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

292
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,478
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

293
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,437
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

294
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,239
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

295
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,072
But no map.

296
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,910
It's invisible.

297
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,718
Oh! Right.

298
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,999
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

299
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,152
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

300
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,438
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

301
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,829
Owned by Freemasons.

302
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,038
- May I see the pipe?
- We don't have it.

303
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,310
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

304
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,871
Nice to meet you, too.

305
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,835
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

306
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,117
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

307
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,152
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

308
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,595
It's not.

309
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,309
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

310
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,598
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

311
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,355
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare Ian away.

312
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,790
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

313
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,348
Of all the words
written here about freedom,

314
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,955
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

315
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,396
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

316
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,040
pursuing invariably the same object,

317
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,908
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

318
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,754
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

319
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,196
and provide new guards
for their future security."

320
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,070
People don't talk that way any more.

321
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,116
Beautiful, huh?

322
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,512
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

323
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,752
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

324
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,477
I'm gonna steal it.

325
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,312
What?

326
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,517
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

327
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,192
Ben?

328
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,389
This is... huge.

329
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,474
It's prison huge.

330
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,790
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

331
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,189
Yeah, probably.

332
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,714
So that would bother most people.

333
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,836
Ian's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

334
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,151
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

335
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,708
It's upside down.

336
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,349
I don't think there's a choice.

337
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,435
Ben, for God's sakes,

338
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,990
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

339
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,150
It's like stealing him.

340
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,791
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

341
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,435
Let me prove it to you.

342
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
OK, Ben, pay attention.

343
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,913
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

344
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,470
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

345
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,630
Over 20 million books.

346
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,075
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

347
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,390
Listen to Riley.

348
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,031
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

349
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,475
Short of builders' blueprints.

350
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,439
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

351
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,999
water and sewage -
it's all here.

352
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,038
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

353
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,556
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

354
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,428
and a little family from Iowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.

355
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,071
And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors

356
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,357
that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.

357
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,674
Now, when it's not on display,

358
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:37,477
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

359
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,398
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

360
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,436
and biometric access-denial systems.

361
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,115
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

362
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,954
to develop the carbonised cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

363
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,359
Edison?

364
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,431
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

365
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,193
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

366
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,511
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

367
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,637
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

368
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,153
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

369
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,629
Delicious jams and jellies?

370
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,280
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

371
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,112
all the documents
and the storage housings

372
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,316
when they're not on display or in the vault.

373
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,518
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

374
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,318
and into the Preservation Room.

375
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,154
The best time for us, or Ian, to steal it
would be during the gala this weekend

376
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,232
when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.

377
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,156
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

378
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,195
Well, if Ian...

379
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,316
Preservation...

380
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,796
The gala, huh?

381
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,990
This might be possible.

382
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,438
It might.

383
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,155
And we are in.

384
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,239
There you are. Hello.

385
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,031
The hallway.

386
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,632
That's what I want.

387
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,671
Game on.

388
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,953
I'll buy that.

389
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,393
Cool.

390
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,155
This just came for you.

391
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,149
I hope it's not from Stan.

392
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,597
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

393
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,038
Abigail Chase.

394
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,515
Hey, Mike.

395
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,120
- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.

396
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,475
- Keep the document level.
- No problem.

397
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,195
What have you got?

398
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,157
The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.

399
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,676
Run full diagnostics,
then I want them all changed out.

400
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,320
Our evil plan is working.

401
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,356
Ben, are you sure that we should...?

402
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,954
Riley.

403
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,755
- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

404
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,478
We're all set in here.

405
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,711
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

406
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,519
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

407
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,676
Howdy.

408
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,395
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

409
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,030
How do you look?

410
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,078
<i>- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.</i>

411
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,036
This is it.

412
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,834
For you.

413
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,195
- Oh, Mr Brown.
- Dr Chase.

414
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,511
- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?

415
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,469
- How does she look?
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.

416
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,120
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

417
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,033
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

418
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,079
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

419
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,071
I really want it.

420
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,277
- Well, you needed it.
- Come on, Romeo, get outta there.

421
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,194
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

422
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,952
on the pipe that Big Foot took.

423
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,393
Hi.

424
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,918
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr Herbert, this is Mr Brown.

425
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,069
- Hi.
- Hi there.

426
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,516
- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

427
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,036
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

428
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,150
A toast, yeah?

429
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,276
To high treason.

430
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,591
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

431
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,708
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

432
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,078
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favourite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

433
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,955
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

434
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,032
in order to do what they knew was right.

435
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,032
What they knew was right.

436
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,877
Well, good night.

437
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,076
- Good night.
- Good night.

438
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,795
Yeah!

439
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,509
OK, go! Go!

440
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,438
This better work.

441
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,231
Clear!

442
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,836
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

443
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,276
How does it look?

444
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,431
It's working.
It's working...

445
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,839
Unbelievable.

446
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,877
Second door. 90 seconds.

447
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,840
Well done, boys. Let's go.

448
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,749
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

449
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,956
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

450
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,869
In five, four,

451
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,030
three... Now.

452
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,028
Ben Gates,

453
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,680
you are now the Invisible Man.

454
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,273
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

455
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,430
What do you got for me?

456
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,678
Hit me with it.

457
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,637
A-E-F-G...

458
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,598
L-O-R-V-Y.

459
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,918
Anagrams being listed.

460
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,956
OK.

461
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,600
Top results: "A glove fry."

462
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,159
"A very golf."

463
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,037
"Fargo levy."

464
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,270
"Gravy floe. Valey frog."

465
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,158
Also "Ago fly rev."

466
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,473
"Grove fly a."

467
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,312
"Are fly gov."

468
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,516
"Era fly gov."

469
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,875
- "Elf gov ray."
- It's "Valley Forge".

470
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,228
"Valley For..."
I don't have that on my computer.

471
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,311
It's "Valley Forge" -
she pressed the E and L twice.

472
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,119
Valley Forge was a turning point
in the American Revolution.

473
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,634
Can I marry your brain?

474
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,751
We're in.

475
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,039
Hello.

476
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,551
Ben, you're doing great.

477
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,916
Ben, pick it up.

478
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,191
You got about one...

479
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,999
We own video.

480
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,194
- I lost my feed.
- What?

481
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,032
I lost my feed, Ben.

482
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,076
I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.

483
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,639
Ben, I have no...
Ben, I have nothing.

484
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,314
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

485
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,834
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

486
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,559
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

487
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,308
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

488
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,079
Gates.

489
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,470
What was that?

490
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,277
Who's shooting?

491
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,990
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

492
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,000
Are you still there? Ben?

493
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,638
I'm in the elevator.

494
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,194
- Ian's here. There was, uh, shooting.
- I hate that guy.

495
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,037
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

496
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,519
Paul Brown?

497
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,113
No. Not here.

498
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,037
Have a good night.

499
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,673
Are you trying to steal that?

500
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,158
It's $35.

501
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,830
- For this?
- Yeah.

502
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,957
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

503
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,829
It's...

504
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,598
I have $32...

505
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,392
57 c.

506
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,429
We take Visa.

507
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,915
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

508
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,594
Where are you, Ben?

509
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,628
- Where are you?
- Stop talking.

510
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,230
Start the van.

511
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,194
Ben, the...
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

512
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,472
Hey.

513
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,994
Oh, it's you. Hello.

514
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,719
Mr Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

515
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,755
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

516
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,796
Stop chatting and get in the van.

517
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,237
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

518
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,029
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

519
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,554
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

520
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,278
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not...?

521
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,956
- No...
- Security! Over here!

522
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,951
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

523
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,238
Security!

524
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,074
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

525
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,755
Go.

526
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,796
Viktor! Move!

527
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,871
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

528
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,760
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

529
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,398
Hold it!

530
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,475
- Wha...?
- Oh, bad.

531
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,959
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

532
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,951
Bad, bad, bad!

533
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,318
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

534
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,753
No! No!

535
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,278
- That's...
- Go! Go!

536
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,751
And just who might you be?

537
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,033
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

538
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,233
Right turn, right turn.

539
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,475
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

540
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,639
Oh, no.

541
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,153
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

542
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,676
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

543
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,669
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.

544
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,757
Get me next to her.

545
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,711
- Thank you.
- No!

546
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,314
Got it. Go on.

547
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,912
Abigail!

548
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,437
Come on. Jump.

549
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,597
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

550
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,000
Well done, Gates. Well done.

551
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,874
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...

552
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,394
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

553
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,959
- Are you hungry?
- What?

554
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,359
Are you all right?

555
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,228
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

556
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,869
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

557
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,032
- She lost it?
- They don't have it.

558
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,156
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

559
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,590
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

560
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,430
You'd do well, Dr Chase,
to be a bit more civilised in this instance.

561
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,314
If this is the real one, what did they get?

562
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,398
A souvenir.

563
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,950
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

564
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,469
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

565
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,718
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

566
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,109
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

567
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,997
And you didn't believe us.

568
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,548
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

569
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,153
<i>Verdammt! Give me that!</i>

570
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,435
You know something?
You're shouting again.

571
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,397
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

572
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,438
Well, we probably deserve that.

573
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,790
Ladies and gentlemen...

574
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,032
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

575
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,078
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

576
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,756
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

577
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,111
Thank you.

578
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,836
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

579
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,593
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

580
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,069
Yes, Agent Hendricks?
You have something?

581
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,437
Um...

582
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,798
- This isn't a day for "Um..."
- We got a tip several days ago

583
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,792
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

584
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,678
Do we have a name on the tipster?

585
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,196
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

586
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,398
How about now?

587
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,359
There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

588
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,194
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

589
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,391
I levelled with you 100 per cent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

590
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,596
I want that document, Mr Brown.

591
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,554
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

592
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,915
I levelled with you 98 per cent.

593
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,560
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

594
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,118
Gates?

595
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,590
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

596
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,877
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

597
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,635
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

598
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,836
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

599
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,990
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

600
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,594
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

601
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,717
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

602
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,836
Also, we found bullet casings.

603
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,478
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

604
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,438
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

605
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,479
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

606
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,870
So...

607
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,032
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

608
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,350
and why weren't they getting along?

609
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,159
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

610
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,277
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

611
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,952
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

612
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,112
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

613
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,634
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

614
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,392
What? Why not?

615
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,155
This is the guy. Dr Herbert said
Dr Chase introduced him as Mr Brown.

616
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,468
Not on the guestlist.

617
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,519
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered".

618
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,433
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

619
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,397
without paying.

620
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,357
He paid with a Visa.

621
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,477
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

622
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,154
A credit-card slip?

623
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,832
Dude, we're on the grid.

624
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,639
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

625
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,110
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

626
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,156
What do we do?

627
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,038
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

628
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,117
You know, get off the road,
take a right.

629
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,952
What letters?

630
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,635
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

631
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,711
We have scans of the originals.

632
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,519
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

633
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,990
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

634
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,118
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

635
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,749
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

636
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,513
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

637
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,034
Thank you.

638
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,029
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

639
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,714
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

640
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,394
Well, not to be a... nudge,

641
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,314
but you do realise how many people
we have after us.

642
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,551
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

643
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,913
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

644
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,754
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

645
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,400
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

646
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,471
Let me go!

647
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,755
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

648
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,035
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

649
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,918
You're not going with the Declaration.

650
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,515
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

651
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,672
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

652
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,911
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

653
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,036
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

654
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,430
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

655
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,391
Clear.

656
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,275
What the...

657
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,279
Now we're getting somewhere.

658
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,875
<i>They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.</i>

659
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,554
Written 1722.

660
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,792
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood."

661
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,637
Gentlemen...

662
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,759
why is this word capitalised?

663
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,479
Because it's important?

664
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,830
Because it's a name.

665
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,798
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

666
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,678
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

667
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,275
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

668
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,954
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

669
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,915
Looks OK.

670
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,514
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

671
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,036
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

672
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,954
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

673
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,190
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

674
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,352
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

675
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,317
See? She's curious.

676
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,272
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

677
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,430
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

678
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,877
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Centre.

679
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,154
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

680
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,151
We keep our focus on Gates.

681
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,435
Run him to ground.

682
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,149
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

683
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,239
I want to find out who this guy is.

684
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,828
Dad.

685
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,031
Where's the party?

686
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,189
Well... I'm in a little trouble.

687
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,714
- Is she pregnant?
- Well, if she is,

688
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,078
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

689
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,435
I look pregnant?

690
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,077
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

691
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,634
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

692
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,429
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

693
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,999
Dad...

694
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,630
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

695
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,676
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

696
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,115
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

697
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,272
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

698
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,272
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

699
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,510
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

700
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,593
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

701
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,875
What do you have? Him?

702
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,037
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

703
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,951
You disappoint me, Ben.

704
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,909
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

705
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,874
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

706
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,469
<i>I found the Charlotte.</i>

707
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,631
<i>The Charlotte?</i>

708
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,193
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

709
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,235
It was amazing, Dad.

710
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,959
And the treasure?

711
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,679
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

712
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,320
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

713
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,868
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

714
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,359
I finally figured it out.

715
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,512
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

716
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,239
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

717
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,393
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

718
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,597
The treasure is a myth.

719
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,910
I refuse to believe that.

720
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,993
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

721
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,197
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

722
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,191
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

723
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,472
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

724
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,871
Looks like animal skin.

725
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,512
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

726
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,149
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

727
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,629
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

728
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,948
Throw it in the oven.

729
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,553
- No.
- Uh-uh.

730
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,200
Ferrous sulphate inks
can only be brought out with heat.

731
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,317
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

732
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,872
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

733
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,075
You need a reagent.

734
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,754
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

735
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,229
I'm fine.

736
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,072
Lemons.

737
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,630
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

738
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,793
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

739
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,591
OK.

740
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,998
OK.

741
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,998
Now, if there is a secret message,

742
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:56,200
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

743
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,793
That's right.

744
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,749
I am so getting fired for this.

745
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,593
I told you. You need heat.

746
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,518
See?

747
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,116
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

748
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,315
That's not a map.

749
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,392
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

750
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,072
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

751
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,594
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

752
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,638
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

753
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,278
Dad, can we have the letters now?

754
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,638
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

755
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,029
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

756
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,872
Oh, OK.

757
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,758
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

758
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,992
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

759
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,753
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

760
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,876
In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

761
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,269
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

762
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,511
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

763
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,114
So, Dad, where are the letters?

764
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:01,990
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

765
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,195
- Dad.
...even found them.

766
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,475
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

767
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,152
<i>- Dad.
...of The New England Courant.</i>

768
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,152
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

769
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,879
I don't have them, son.

770
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,599
- What?
- I don't have them.

771
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,519
Where are they?

772
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,956
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

773
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,431
Time to go.

774
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,877
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

775
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,359
The back of what?

776
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,476
No!

777
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,949
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

778
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,508
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

779
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,239
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

780
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,357
Yes. And it's very delicate.

781
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,556
You stole it?

782
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,760
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

783
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,434
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

784
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,751
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

785
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,559
And now you've destroyed yours.

786
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,476
And you pulled me into all this.

787
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,913
Well, we can't have that.

788
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,828
Come in!

789
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,831
I'm in here.

790
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,671
FBI, right?

791
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,675
You gonna untie me?

792
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,629
And you have no idea where he's going?

793
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,599
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

794
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,716
He tied me to a chair.

795
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,679
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

796
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,751
And he stole my car.

797
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,675
Don't worry, Mr Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

798
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,430
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

799
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,239
I think we should change clothes.

800
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,754
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

801
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,718
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

802
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,711
Here, I took this from his house.

803
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,349
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

804
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,433
<i>- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?</i>

805
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,956
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

806
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,670
Excuse me.

807
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,558
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

808
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,551
That's OK.

809
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,796
S-S-A-N-D.

810
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,472
OK.

811
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,479
You're sure this is right?

812
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,119
OK.

813
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,952
S-S-A...

814
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,678
No, N.

815
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,877
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

816
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,871
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

817
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,275
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

818
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,830
Go get the last four letters.

819
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,229
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

820
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,832
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

821
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,075
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and..."

822
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,720
"Pass and..." what?

823
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,200
"Pass and..."

824
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,589
What's going on?

825
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,471
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

826
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:07,190
So you show up at your father's door
and say you're in trouble

827
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,955
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

828
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,315
Is there a question in there?

829
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,834
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

830
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,799
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

831
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,474
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

832
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,358
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you"?

833
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,556
Yes.

834
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,200
More than one someone?

835
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,439
Yes.

836
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,317
Oh. Well, then my father would say

837
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,631
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

838
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,030
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?
