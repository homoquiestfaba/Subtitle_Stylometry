Rigoletto!                      
Now hush and pay attention,     

3
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:48,580
Or you'll miss something        
really important.               

4
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,650
Once upon a time,               
in a land far away--            

5
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,486
So far away you'd               
never know it existed--         

6
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,054
There lived                     
an Elfin prince.                

7
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,758
To his people,                  
he was called Rigoletto.        

8
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,392
He was a master of song,        

9
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:04,496
And he used the art             
of music to heal his people,    

10
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,065
And they lived in peace         
and prosperity                  

11
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,267
Unknown to                      
the race of men.                

12
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:13,371
And on these distant shores     
lived the Princess Gorfindel.   

13
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,039
She was lovely to behold        

14
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,576
And her voice was cherished     
by all who heard her sing.      

15
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:21,846
She loved Rigoletto,            
and he her,                     

16
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:25,016
But cold winds                  
blew them ill will--            

17
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:28,986
Mortal men who came to destroy  
the Elfin kingdom               

18
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:32,456
On the night before             
Rigoletto and Gorfindel         

19
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,660
Were to be wed                  
in eternal bliss.               

20
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,929
        Yuck.                   

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,065
            What do you         
            mean "yuck"?        

22
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,169
                    Go ahead,   
                    Bonnie.     

23
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:49,273
And Rigoletto would             
not yet know happiness,         

24
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:52,144
For he was struck               
in battle by an evil sword,     

25
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,146
Which left half                 
of his face pale,               

26
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:58,616
Deathlike                       
and hideous to behold.          

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,122
In his pride, Rigoletto allowed 
the ugliness of his face        

28
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:09,694
To poison his heart,            
making it ugly as well.         

29
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:13,230
And none could heal him.        

30
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:18,102
So Rigoletto left his kingdom   
and went into the world of men, 

31
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,871
Accompanied only                
by his betrothed                

32
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,108
And his faithful servant,       

33
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,011
Never to return until he found  
one from the world of men       

34
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:31,583
Of pure heart, whose love       
would break the evil spell.     

35
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,889
I wish I could sing             
like the Princess.              

36
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,625
Then I would win

00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:48,059

His name's Ribaldi.             

218
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,938
Other than that, nobody seems   
to know a thing about him,      

219

Except that he has access       
to large amounts of money.

I could lose my job,            

277

And without a job, my family

Like what?                      

353
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,643
            It's like he's      
            hiding something--  

354
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:22,579
            This dark secret.   

355
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,481
            He wouldn't even    
            let me see him.     

356
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,149
        As we talked, he just   
        kept in the shadows,    

357
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,684
            And then, when      
            he got angry,       

358
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:30,487
            It was as if        
            he were this beast. 

359
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,958
So...Either                     
we're homeless...               

360
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:37,661
Or I go to work                 
for a person                    

361
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:43,166
That's more like                
a beast than a man?             

362
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:47,704
        Sweetheart,             
        this is not worth it.   

363
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:50,774
    It's okay.                  

364
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,042
    I don't mind.               

365
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:54,511
Could it be worse               
than being homeless?            

366
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:55,946
                Maybe.          

367
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,348
Let me at least                 
try it for one day.             

368
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,484
                He is different.

369
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:07,491
But, being different            
doesn't make you bad...Does it? 

370
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,962
        Most of the time, no.   
        But sometimes it does.  

371
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,967
Well, there's only              
one way to find out.            

372
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:25,535
                Bonnie, do you  
                see this door?  

373
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:26,102
    Yes.                        

374
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:27,571
            This door, here.    

375
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:28,838
    I see it.                   

376
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:34,778
        You must never,         
        never enter this room.  

377
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,146
        Do you understand?      

378
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,150
        I can't hear you.       

379

        Have you ever

384
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,440

385

    Yes.

if I go into the room?          

389
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,094
            The master resides  
            in that room.       

390
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,596
            The master          
            desires his privacy 

391
00:24:26,697 --> 00:24:29,465
        More than anything      
        else in life.           

392
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,869
        Should you invade       
        that privacy,           

393
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,705
        You risk his anger.     

394
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:40,210
                His anger can   
                be terrible.    

395
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,647
                Do you          
                understand now? 

396
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,616
So what will he do?             

397
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,756
        If you promise me       

398
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:58,595
        That you will never     
        go into that room,      

399

            what happens?

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,135

            a great black beast.

581
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,746
        It turns on its creator 
        and devours him or her. 

582

I never lie,                    
either.                         

583
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,819
        That is good to know.   

584
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:28,491
        Trust is the best way   
        to begin a relationship.

585
00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:33,096
        Now, tell me the truth--

586
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:37,000
        Did you like what you   
        heard from Gabriella?   

587
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,501
        It was beautiful.       

588
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,203
Yes, it was.                    

589
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,770
    In fact, you have           
    never heard anything

591
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,941
                No, never!      

592
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,977
        And do you know why     
        Gabriella is the best?  

593
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,579
She was born that way?          

594
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:53,283
    Born that way?              

595
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:55,851
    Born that way?              

596
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,789
    No...And yes.               

597
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,392
You see, many are born          
with what Gabriella has,        

598
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:06,595
But few ever become             
what Gabriella is.              

599
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:10,399
No, Gabriella is the best       
because I made her so.          

600
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,336
She is the product              
of my genius.                   

601
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,773
            You're not very     
            humble, are you?    

602
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:17,873
Humble? Humble.                 

603
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:21,678
No,                             
should I be?                    

604
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:24,580
        Humility is a virtue,   
        Mr. Ribaldi.            

605
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,083
            I should think      
            you should have     

606
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,652
                A lot to be     
                humble about.   

607
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:35,524
My, you are an honest           
little brute, aren't you?       

608
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,193
So, what are you saying?        

609
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,263
                Nothing.

            You're not...

Do not insult me.

What--you think                 
that I'm not ugly?              

614
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,009
Where is honesty now?           

615
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:58,547
            No...I mean yes...  
            I-I mean...

That I am ugly!

You think that I am ugly!

                Yes, sir!

                an ugly heart!  

621
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,025
            That's worse than   
            having an ugly face!

622
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,527
            You can't control   
            the way you look,   

623
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:14,763
    But you can control         
    the way you treat others!

and I am ugly.                  

626
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,508
Now you may go.                 

627
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:36,319
    Did you really teach her    
    to sing like that?

And he acted                    
like one, too.                  

632
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:53,669

        go back to that place.

But...There was something       
even more strange

with him today,                 

638
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:06,815

just like a Princess

00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,185
And sang like an Angel.         

640
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:13,089
And he said that                
he taught her to sing.

something so wonderful          

643
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,865

to be so bad?                   

644
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,201

652
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,455

01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:31,698
He hires the handsomest man     
he can, named Christian,        

1044
01:04:31,799 --> 01:04:33,966
To "woo" the beautiful Roxanne  

1045
01:04:34,067 --> 01:04:36,770
By saying the things            
that Cyrano writes for him.     

1046
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:38,471
Well,                           
it just so happens              

1047
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:40,774
That Roxanne falls in love      
with Christian,                 

1048
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:42,909
But not because he's handsome,  

1049
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,412
But because he expresses        
a beautiful soul                

1050
01:04:45,513 --> 01:04:47,914
By the things                   
he says and writes.             

1051
01:04:48,015 --> 01:04:50,583
Problem is that Christian       
also loves Roxanne,             

1052
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:53,120
But can't tell her              
because he has a hard time      

1053
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,255
Expressing his feelings...      

1054
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:57,390
    So who get's the girl?      

1055

    have I told you             

1061

1062
01:05:21,815 --> 01:05:25,385
        Perhaps I could give    
        you a lesson or two.

to give me a lesson!

working for Mr. Ribaldi,

01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:34,218
          Before I left         
            for home.           

1404
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,720
            Where's home?       

1405
01:31:35,821 --> 01:31:37,489
                    Far away.   

1406
01:31:37,589 --> 01:31:40,525
    So far away I'd never       
    thought it existed?         

1407
01:31:40,626 --> 01:31:44,362
            Some might put it   
            that way, yes.      

1408
01:31:44,464 --> 01:31:47,098
            Well, I've people   
            waiting for me.     

1409
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:49,767
                I'd better go.  

1410
01:31:53,139 --> 01:31:57,441
    I found something           
    that might belong to you.   

1411
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:02,346
            B-b-but this...     

1412
01:32:02,448 --> 01:32:05,150
Porter...                       

1413
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,454
            This was            
            Mr. Ribaldi's.      

1414
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:25,103
    Hey!                        

1415
01:32:25,204 --> 01:32:27,071
Who are you?                    

1416
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:28,840
        What's your name?       

1417
01:32:28,941 --> 01:32:30,808
                 <i>My name?</i>       

1418
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,611
        Some people             
        call me Rigoletto.      

1419
01:32:36,716 --> 01:32:40,018
        But then, you don't     
        believe that, do you?   

1420
01:32:52,698 --> 01:32:56,001
            Rigoletto...        
            Do you believe it?  

1421
01:32:56,102 --> 01:32:59,571
    No, do you?                 

1422
01:32:59,672 --> 01:33:02,006
[ Bonnie: ]                     
...Restored to his kingdom,     

1423
01:33:02,107 --> 01:33:04,442
Rigoletto took                  
his beautiful bride             

1424
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:10,515
    And left the world of men   
  to dwell happily ever after.  

1425
01:33:10,616 --> 01:33:12,951
                Do you believe  
                that, Bonnie?   

1426
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,022
                    I do.
